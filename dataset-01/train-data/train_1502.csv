2,So what's new?,"It is for some time obious that the USA is on the path of its destruction. The trade deficit, the Iraq war, the fiscal deficit, the country's debt & the personal debts obiously can not go on without eventually turning the USA into an other broke country.From that point the book did not tell anything new, but kept repeating old news. About investment, I noticed that he is pushing mainly Gold, with hinting about investing in non US Dollar Markets."
1,The selling of Armageddon,"Since the 1980's, Bill Bonner (along with various ""co-authors"" such as Addison Wiggin) has been very successful selling his ""Blood in the Streets"" predictions. But guess what? The American economy continues to prove him wrong year after year after year ..."
4,But you better like honky tonk music,"This is a great cd, if you like country music. Wonderful to listen to during a divorce, a breakup, or even just when you're mad or remembering an old boyfriend. Someone Else's trouble now is particularly uplifting after being liberated from a bad relationship. I listen to this when I'm mad at my hubbie, and he usually gets the hint *grin* Ladies, try ""forgetting"" that it's in the cd player and see if he gets the hint!"
2,A CD that was not Community Property,"This spectacular collection is aimed for the female of species, especially when the alimony is overdue, the lawyer hasn't been paid, and one needs a pot to pity in.Who's Lonely now by Highway 101 is outstanding, and Younger Men raises a massage of hope. And of course, Never gonna be your fool again by DeAnna Cox is more uplifting than Dolly Parton.Sic transit gloria mundi."
4,Spoiled!,"I have to disagree with the other comments in regards to the writing size of the text on the actual link itself....exactly what size were you expecting it to be, given Italian charms are all the same standard size? Of course its going to be small with mini-print. This is one of the links on my keychain and it's adorable, readable, and on a matte background. I'm able to read it, no problem, but then I knew what to expect size-wise when I ordered the item. Pleased, arrived quickly, and I thanked my fiance for the appropriate gift to add to my other links :)"
1,Bracelet,I thought it would work on my charm bracelet but it wasn't the charm I thought it was....it was flat and I wanted it to be more round and holes to fit a bracelet
3,Great Case / Bad Fit,"The case itself seems great, but my Kala soprano uke (Kala Mahogany Soprano Ukulele w/binding) won't fit in it. The body fits perfectly, but the tuning knobs are too wide for the case's opening. So, unfortunately, I'll be returning it."
5,Great Shoe,This is the perfect shoe for jeans as well as dress slacks.I can wear them most of the day. Comfort as well as style made mebuy a second pair. I wish Amazon carried the dark brown.
4,Love Thing for West Coast Swing,"The cut called ""Love Thing"" is a Texas swing blues romp. Really great West Coast Swing dance song with a dance groove and a few breaks."
1,A Waste of Space in my Suitcase,This book didn't help us at all - quite a disappointment. Much better books are AN OUTDOOR FAMILY GUIDE TO YELLOWSTONE AND GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARKS by LISA GOLLIN EVANS and FROMMER'S YELLOWSTONE AND GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARKS.
1,"NOT the ""Best Travel Guide to Yellowstone and Grand Teton""","This book provided little help for my last trip to Yellowstone. Don't believe the title. The maps are terrible and the book seems very poorly organized. There is just very little detail except for bars in Jackson Hole. This book should be titled ""The Bar Guide to Jackson Hole"". Forget about this one if you want helpful and detailed information on Yellowstone."
2,Outdated....,"Good basic guide but you want the information to be up to date. I guess I should have looked at the publish date before I ordered. Ex. Says Campgrounds are first come first serve...not true, many now have a reservation only policy which could get you in a bit of trouble. Better books are offered out there."
3,Not great,"Bought these to use while I was overseas. Great job shipping and with customer service, but they are pretty cheap and not really what I was looking for. Pretty awkward to work with."
5,A brilliant collection of Afro-Portugese music.,"This compilation album of Afro-Portugese music is wonderful. The songs are beautiful and hypnotic. Although I cannot understand the languages represented on this CD, the power of the music makes the language barrier irrelevant. I loved all of the songs, but ""Mona Ki Ngi Xica"" by Bonga, ""Salale"" by Vum Vum, and ""Mama Africa"" by Danny Silva were, for me, standout selections."
2,Rootsy but uninspired,"The trouble with most Afropop is that it's melodically simple, and this album is no exception to that rule. Two chords and a lot of repetition. Exceptional Afropop makes up for this with rhythmic complexity, energy and creative combinations of instruments, but you'll hear none of that here. It sounds authentic (except for the few tracks with synthesizers) but I have a feeling Cape Verde and Angola deserve better."
1,Problems with the binding,The book is coming apart at the center.Doubt if I will get through the sermon series before it comes apart.I think you should send me another one and I well send this one back
5,My favorite sweet snack!,These cookies have just the right amount of sweetness for me. They aren't extremely sweet like many of the other cookies you get at the grocery store.However the amazon price currently is $11+ for a can which is a HUGE ripoff. I buy these for $3.50 at my local grocery store. Try searching for them at your local stores before buying it here! Or I'm sure there's some website that's cheaper too.
4,Nice story,I like them better when you find out that year's from now they are great ess at and have weathered the storms
3,"it's ok, but expensive for a board game.","I bought this for my 11 year old son who is a football nut. I thought it would be a good learning game, but he doesn't really like it, and I find it has kind of simple minded mechanical outcomes that are not very exciting. The instructions are a bit confusing and will have to be read and re-read by an adult before they are fully understood.The game is OK, but not great."
2,Don Juan ruined by star and director,"I looked forward to seeing this French film but after about 20 minutes of it, I was bored despite the beautiful presence of Penelope Cruz who sounds great in French (her first foreign language) as she does in her native Spanish. What ruined it for me was that Don Juan was played by Jacques Weber, who's too old and ugly to pass for a Casanova which woman fall for. There are so many more handsome European actors that could've been more convincing like Olivier Martinez, Antonio Banderas and even Cruz's current beau, Javier Badem. Outside of Cruz, Emmanuelle Beart is also sensational!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I saw this at the local electronics store and couldn't resist. Reading the content, it looked like a good selection of ELP's works. Unfortunately, the sound quality of the live performances is so poor that it's painful to listen to these classics. It sounds as if someone took a cheap cassette recorder to a show and that tape was later laid on a CD. Don't waste your money if you searching for a compilation that delivers the true sound of ELP's music."
1,how many?,"How many reissues can they put out? This must be some kind of a record? This is getting ridiculous!! I used to have a lot of respect for this group but putting out all these reissues and repackages is crazy, and is obviously to squeeze the maximum money out of the fans (if there are any left)! I can't recommend this CD. It's just another rehash of the same old stuff!"
2,Don't bother,"I am an avid fan of the discworld series, even though I am not a huge fantasy fan. I had run out of books in the series, so I thought I would give this book a try. I was sorely disappointed. The book is divided into chapters about science, and chapters on the discworld story. I found the science section to be rambling and useless, completely unlike such offerings as Bill Bryson's A short history of nearly everything. I would have accepted this if the narrative was good, but it was lacking in the usual Pratchett irony. One problem may have been that it is a return to the Wizard characters of the early discworld books, who have faded in favor of Sam Vines and other characters. I feel that these characters are far more superficial- humor coming from their idiocy, rather than the irony of situation or the implied commentary on current events."
4,"Not quite one or the other, but still worth reading","A short but entertaining Discworld story alternating with entertaining science writing. Both sides of this book are a bit light, but it's still a good read. Would make pretty good supplementary reading for a science course. Of special interest to parents, teachers, and students."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The second Science of Discworld book, as the title suggests, narrows its focus. While the first took a lot at the cosmological and astronomical overview, this one changes to a focus on the actual planet, and how it formed and developed. This means in both a discworld sense, and the actual real world science behind our planet, in this simplified form."
5,An Urban dog in the suburbs.,"I had the opportunity to work with Cis several years ago when I lived in Chicago. I found her training to be invaluable at the time. I was so glad to see her book published because I am considering having a litter and can now follow her directions step by step via long distance.Although I no longer live in the city, having a city trained dog is even better in the suburbs! I find suburban dwellers are so secure in their environment that they take far too many risks with their dog's safety.Cis knows how to train a dog to fit into it's environment and be a welcome guest in any home."
3,Simplicity wins,"Cis Frankel has done a great job of providing dog owners with an easy to read training guide. Urban Dog covers the situations and behaviors that all dog owners must learn about and deal with. Her training style promotes a bond between you and your dog, which is something absent in many other methods. She also stresses the importance of having fun while you train. I started in one of her ""puppy kindergarten"" classes before I knew about the book; I chose her based on recommendations of dog owners in my neighborhood. It has proved to be an excellent choice, and we have continued to the next training level with her. The book is a great reference tool, whether you have trained with Cis or not. She has a great deal of knowledge and talent with canine behaviour, and it comes through well in the book. I recommend this to every dog owner - particularly if you live in the city!"
1,misleading advertisment and service,"The cd was in japenese for Teresa Tong, and wouldn't give back credit or refund. Terrible, terrible, and unreasonable!"
5,Wiser and wiser,Mary Oliver's poetry pays attention to what is most important in life. She is a master of words that speak to the heart.
5,Car seat mat,My package arrived damaged. I called Amazon to inform them. The lady who helped me was wonderful . A new car seat mat was sent out the same day. Love the new mat to put under car seat. Good job Amazon on service!!!
4,It does the job and fits real good,I got this for my new Acura MDX 08. It protects my leather seats though over time they started to get some wear and tear from its non-sticky bottom. I still thinks it is a good thing to have if you want to protect your car.
5,Perfect for protecting your upholstery,Bought this specifically to protect the light colored upholstery of our car. Our son's car seat faces backwards and his little feet like to tap on the seat back. His shoes were getting dirt and scuff marks all over and I was sick of trying to keep it clean. This works like a charm. Easy to wipe off and install. I definitely recommend it.
5,Durable and does the job,"I bought one a few years ago, and am back for another for the second kid. It's very durable and thanks to the thick padding, does a good job protecting the seat. It's even machine washable!"
5,The quality is good.,"When I picked this item to buy, I just pick for the cheaper price. It looks like thin and the material is cheap from the image. but it surprises me when I received it. It has high quality package and makes in good material. Very thick."
5,Does the job well,"I got these to protect the new seats in the new car from the grandchildren's car seats. They installed easily and so did the car seats over them. No problem with the latch system that wouldn't have existed without the mats. Just have to wreck your hand to protect your young ones with the latch system! No marks , no stains after removal of seats and mats."
4,Car Seat Cover,"Slips a lit bit and then its hard for our 6 year old to find the seatbelt buckle. However, it protects the seats and I'm thankful for that...overall pretty good just a little pricey."
2,chicknscratch,"Again, this is 'okay,' mat to cover your car seat. My back seats are rather large and it barely covers them. If you have smaller car seats this may be okay for you. It is at least protecting the leather seats but I would have liked something larger."
5,Easy to install; look well made,"So far, they are as advertised. I have not checked my seats yet to see if impressions are being made from the car seats, but they look good, fit well and keep the 2nd row looking neat."
1,Don't bother,"Stroller was very cheaply built. Seat does not go back too much (about 3 inches). Front wheels stick too much, did not swivel. Harness is terrible. Hood does not stay properly. Just too many problems. Don't bother, it's just not worth it."
1,cheaply made junk,"Wow, what a disappointment. Where do I start? The numerous sharp edges from the sloppy moulding of the plastic parts? the front wheels that don't swivel well, leaving them to chatter sideways when I'm walking forward? the ""safety bar"" that pops off easily? Well, at least it didn't cost much. My wife bought this to take on a trip because it's lighter and smaller than our graco stroller. OK, there's 2 good things- It's kinda light and kinda small. Still, I'd rather carry my kid than use this annoying thing. You are much better off buying a good stroller or a moby wrap."
3,A bit misleading,"My mom had ordered this stroller for our son's Chirstmas gift. It arrived 2 months late, which was really depresing. I was really suprised becuase Amazon usually is very diligent with it's shipping...The box arrived in good condition, but it didn't say ""bebe amore"" it said ""bebe love usa"" which was kind of interesting. At first we thought they sent the wrong stoller.The description on Amazon says that this weighs a little over 4 pounds. That is a COMPLETE lie. The box even says ""5.5kg"" which translates to about 13 pounds.I do like alot of things about this stoller though. It was easy to assemble, the cushion on the handle bars is nice, and I LOVE the mesh basket underneath. It also came with a strap, which is awesome. So when it's folded up you can just sling it over your shoulder and go.I personally think it's a bit over priced, but Im happy with it."
3,Good idea badly made with inadequate hardware,"While the idea behind this device is sound its manufacture needs improvement. The one I have has none of its rollers in quite the same plane - some deviate 1/4"" - which neccessitates constant attention to make large workpieces track straight. The bracket that attaches to the saw was warped and needed alot of filing and shimming before the roller table would aline with the saw table. Included screws are easy to break and are best replaced when possible or tightened very gently when not. Some additional washers were needed where helical lockwashers are used over slots.If you're the sort who owns a cabinet saw and have the time, you can probably make a better (and cheaper) outfeed table yourself."
3,This is not a precision piece of equipment,"The idea is great the execution is lacking. There is too much varience with the rollers; when you align the ones closest to the table with the table and then level the furthest ones with the tables, some of the rollers in between are either lower or higher. Can't do anything about that. While the varience isn't too much, it could be a problem later. Not great but not horrible either."
1,Just right!,"When shop space is at a premium and you rip long stock all the time, than you couldn't ask for a better piece to add to your cabinet saw."
2,Poor construction is dissappointing.,I had one of these on a table saw ten years ago and it worked great. I bought a new Delta saw and thought I would get another one. The first one arrived with the main frame severely bent and not usable. Amazon sent a replacement and the main frame was welded so it would not sit flat against the saw. I tried to order a third one but it was back ordered. I contacted HTC directly and they said they were in the process of redesigning the unit but would send me a new main frame. It arrived welded crooked also.It is such a good idea for a small shop I will probably reorder when the new design is available and see if they have improved their welding.
3,Doesn't fit my powermatic 2000,"I recently purchased this outfeed roller and I am in the process of returning it. The finish look overall ok but I can't fit it to my powermatic 2000.The support arm get in the way of the dust collection port (which is at the back of the cabinet). Unless you give up dust collection or do some major work in the cabinet to move the dust port it is not possible to install this product.Too bad it looked like a good addition.By the way, I ran into the same problem as another reviewer, amazon first forgot to ship one of the box. They however reshipped the whole thing promptly. Let see if returning the product is as easy."
4,Table saw outfeed table,"Instructions were very clear and easy to understand.I had the table installed on the saw in less than an hour. But, it was installed on a Delta Unisaw, so some of the holes were pre-drilled."
3,For the truly cheap cook who'll eat anything.,"The idea is great, the tips are great -- if you can stomach them. I knew this book wasn't for me when I read early on something like: ""This doesn't taste like the real thing, but you'll get used to it."" If saving money is a matter of survival, this is the book you want. If you're a bit more discriminating, I'd spend an extra buck or two at the supermarket. Not to say that this book doesn't get you in the mood to save money; it does, and it gives lots of things you've probably never thought of before, like baking your own bread (yummy) and your own soups (great when it's cold; uses up lots of leftovers and less-than-perfect veggies), but the recipes aren't something I'm prepared to economize THAT much for."
5,A wonderful but disturbing book.,"I had a little difficulty getting this book, but I'm glad that I did finally find it. It is a wonderful mystery, even though the subject behind the mystery is disturbing. I know that I knew about research done on live animals, but I never thought about with dogs somehow. I pictured lab rats and mice. It goes against everything that I believe in to use our domestic best friends for product testing and experiments. But the mystery was good, and I enjoyed Holly and her friends again. Ms. Conant knows how to write a story while she bravely uncovers some less than desirable facts about big business. This is a wonderful series for dog lovers, or for any animal lovers if it comes to that."
5,came early and in good condition,"No complaints, book arrived sooner than I expected and was in good condition as advertised."
1,No mutts allowed,"It's so hard to find good dog books, and I did have hopes for this series. But bamboo under my fingernails couldn't make me read more. The author uses the pretext of a story (with a flimsy plot at that) to preach at her audience about animal issues. And while some of these issues have validity, a work of fiction is not the place for them. Completely turned me off her books. Not to mention the snobby pure-bred elitism common in books about dog shows, etc. No, gimme a good ole mutt any day. This book was all-around horrible. I think I only finished it so I'd be good and riled to write the review, otherwise I might have stopped half-way through. The only good thing I can say about this book is that at least it was short."
4,Stories that stay with you,"Every one of Perry Klass's stories has a point - not subtle or obtuse, but also not hackneyed or expected. Her stories reflect the realities of life as a doctor, mother, and human being. The writing is not 'beautiful', nor will it win prizes for poetic imagery. Rather, it is clear, direct, and sticks to your bones like a good solid meal. It's a great airplane book - that is, it keeps your interest, is worth spending time on, but is not so challenging as to require one's entire intellectual attention."
2,"Great concept, bad taste","I love the idea of champagne truffles, but these weren't it. They were flavorless and unimpressive. We ended up throwing away half of the box."
3,INTERESTING - MAYBE,Bethany Burke ordered most everything out of a catalog.. Colt McClure put an ad in the Cattleman's catalog seeking a job.He never speaks of his past and the mystery deepens when a bouncing baby girl appears on the ranch doorstep ----- addressed to Colt!Bethany is trying to hold onto her ranch and needs a good worker to help her and Dita make repairs and run the cattle.Colt has a way with horses and special training and his dream is to start a training clinic. What better than to throw in with Bethany but will he have to reveal his secrets ---- especially about the baby Alyssa???? He also wins over Frisco and Eddie and of course Jesse James. [check them out]The story is interesting to a point and either I or it ran out of steam towards the end. It was worth a read but I was ready for another book. Loved the way it ended [you almost miss it]
5,review,got my cd much sooner than i expected--it was here in 3 days and in perfect condition---thank you!!!!!!
2,Cold August,"August again finds Eric Clapton teaming up with Phil Collins and much like Behind The Sun, the results are disappointing. ""It's In The Way That You Use"" was featured in Martin Scorcese's The Color Of Money and is a solid song, but the album doesn't offer much else. It is mostly made up of glossy songs with alot of synthesizers. This makes Mr. Clapton sound like he is trying to catch up with trends instead of setting his own."
2,"Big Hits, so-so album","""August"" follows the trend of most 1980s Clapton albums. Take a couple of first rate singles (in this case ""Its in the Way That You Use It"" and ""Tearing Us Apart"") and place them on an album full of filler material. There is little else here that is memorable or worth hearing more than a couple of times. Overall, one of Clapton's weaker albums."
1,this is garbage,"This is garbage, pure Phil Collins garbage. Don't buy it, unless you are a fan of PHil Collins. PUaj, puaj. puaj. Please, take a listen to songs like Layla, Cocaine or the old Sunshine of your Love and compare. Pure blues rock against this kind of musak. One star is too much. I couldn't rate with 0."
2,"In the Grand Schemes of Eric Albums, This One Stinks","OK--I have to warn you--I am a huge Eric fan. When I was in high school I bought my first Eric Album--a 45 which was ""For Your Love"" and have purchased every record and CD of his since. Eric Clapton is God. One of the smoothest most tastefull guitarists ever.This album stinks. It is overproduced pop garbage. To me its like if Van Halen did a standards album. I just never thought of Eric doing pop, and well, he pulled it off, but leave pop to the Babyface's or other slick musicians of this world to do. Ugh.There are simply no tastey licks, no screaming guitar solos, no inspiration, and no emotion. Of all my Clapton albums, and I have got a ton, this is my least favorite."
3,Would you believe an Eric Clapton cd you can DANCE to???,"Complete with synthysisers, drum machines and Tina Turner, this EC release comes off like pure late '80s MTV pop!The two hits, ""It's In The Way That You Use It"" and ""Tearin' Us Apart"" are undenyably enjoyable, but the rest you only tolerate because it's Eric Clapton. But even that much slack can only go so far when compared to rest of his career.His next release, ""The Journeyman"" put him back in top form!"
5,Good songs.,"I love this CD. It's from the `80s, but it doesn't sound ""dated"" to me. It's just good sounding music. It features Eric Clapton on vocals and tasty guitar, Nathan East with his funky bass guitar lines, Phil Collins with his diverse and heavy drum beats, and the creative keyboard melodies of Greg Phillinganes. Highlights for me are ""Run"", ""Tearing Us Apart"" (A duet with Tina Turner), ""Hung Up On Your Love"", ""Miss You"", ""Behind The Mask"", and ""Grand Illusion"".I actually bought this CD after watching the ""Eric Clapton & Friends Live 1986"" DVD, which I also recommend. It features several of the songs on this CD.For optimal listening pleasure, I recommend the re-mastered version of this CD. Big sound, good songs."
2,A Very Different Sound For Clapton,"I'm one of the biggest Clapton fans you'll meet, but I just didn't like this album. That's fine, though, he's allowed to experiment with different styles of music all he wants- most of the time he's always incredible. The only reason I bought this CD was for ""Holy Mother"" which has become one of my favorite songs. Thinking back I should have just looked for it on mp3. Oh well, no big loss. Clapton is still God in my book..."
5,ignore everyone else,Look this if you like clapton this is the most UNDERRATED album he did. Why? Because people think he sold out and went with keyboards and synths....ignore them the guitar work in this album will drop your jaw. MISS YOU is one of his best if you ever saw him play this live OHHH MANN!!! Then on the other hand you have HOLY MOTHER which would be the saddest song if he didn't kick your butt with the lead....You know it may not be a blues album but the guitar work is still AMAZING....you have to hear this album if you like EC!!!!
4,It's Really Not That Bad!,"""August"" may be one of Clapton's least popular recordings. At times the mid-'80s production is a bit too slick. And it is pop. But ""Walk Away,"" ""Hold On,"" and ""Holy Mother"" are a few of the most beautiful pop songs E.C. has ever recorded. Give this one a chance - you just might like it!"
3,Clapton in the 80s with Phil Collins is predictable but not bad,"If you're familiar with Eric Clapton's output in the 80s, and mix in the influence of Phil Collins, August is a fairly predictable album. It has a few really good songs (The Way That You Use It, Tearing Us Apart) and several other songs that are decent enough to make this one worth owning for Clapton fans. I don't mean predictable in a necessarily bad way, I mean that it sounds like No Jacket Required crossed with a mellowed post-rehap Clapton. A lot of it sounds dated, with 80s synth and drum sounds. But Clapton is an exceptional musician and so is Phil Collins, so this is in no way a ""bad"" album. It's just not a CD that blows me away. After you've worn out all the Cream material, the Layla album, his self-titled ""Eric Clapton"" release, and burned out on the greatest hits, if you want some more EC, buy Journeyman. Then, if you'd like another good Clapton CD pick up August."
3,Clapton Lite,"Released during the height of Eric Clapton's Phil Collins-produced beer commericial phase, ""August"" is one of his weaker original studio albums. The first track, ""It's in the Way that You Use it,"" is a single from the ""Color of Money"" soundtrack that doesn't really belong with the rest of the material, but inclusion of which probably rescued the album from commercial oblivion. After that is the tough Tina Turner duet ""Tearing Us Apart"" that is the album's highlight. From there on, most of the album is the kind of lightweight fluff more suitable to Collins that to the man many consider the greatest rock guitarist of all time. Only the mournful ballad ""Holy Mother"" shows any real inspiration.Overall, a mediocre release from an artists who is capable of much better things."
2,One Of Eric's Worst Albums,"There are some good songs on this album, but not enough to make it a good one. ""It's In The Way That You Use It"" is a pretty good song, but since it was added on later to cash in on the movie ""The Color Of Money"", it really doesn't fit in with the rest of the album. Other highlights of the album are the storming duet with Tina Turner ""Tearin' Us Apart"" and the beautiful ballad ""Holy Mother"", written for the late Richard Manuel (formerly of The Band), who had commited suicide not long before the album's recording. ""Behind The Mask"" isn't particulary bad, but it doesn't sound like anything Eric has recorded before or since. Otherwise, this album is crap. Save for the songs previously mentioned, it's just one boring, unmemorable song after another."
3,Its in the way that you use it!,"I love the song, ""Its In The Way That You Use It"", and there are a couple of other good ones on the CD, and some good solos. Overall, though, this CD sounds too much like Phil Collins for my taste. I like the tone of Eric's guitar and his licks are great, but I prefer it when he does things his own way. The first track is great though."
2,Definately not his best,"Eric Clapton is one of the greatest musical artists of all time and has some great albums, but this isn't one of them. If you like the Miami Vice 80's synthesizer stuff, this is the album for you. Thankfully he was only experimenting here. I would strongly recommend Journeyman instead. It's his best album during the 80's, if not his best yet."
3,"Not as ""tricky"" as I expected","I ordered this book because the reviews were great, but after receiving it and looking through the ""tricks,"" I didn't see much that those of us who already do a lot of mental math haven't already figured out. For instance, what is 98 x 7? The trick is to realize that 98 is 2 less than 100. So do 100 x 7 (= 700), and then subtract 2 x 7 (=14), which equals 686. Lots of tricks along this vein. If you found my example helpful, you'll probably like more of the tricks in this book."
2,Math Fun,This was just an ok Math Book the tricks are very basic. I would send back if I could but not worth the $
4,Easy reading,"Excellent book, easy to read and understand, cartoons help to remember. Everyday applicability and easy to use tricks and hints. I recommend it."
4,Decent ideas for the price,"Many of the Math ""tricks"" were similar to those taught in the math curriculum used at school. There were some different ideas, however, so the book was still worth the purchase."
5,Greeks Alive!,"Brought ancient Greece and the Greek culture come alive for our three kids (12,11, 7). Tremendously useful list of extra readings and resources for each lesson. We were able to locate the majority of extra books in our local library. Good discussion questions. Helps Christian families see Greek mythology from Biblical perspectives. You can find some (much needed) scheduling helps by looking on the Greenleaf Press website, where Rob Shearer outlines his own lesson calendar. Truly excellent resource."
1,Disappointing plastic simulation uses lead weight to con you,"While this corkscrew does work, spray painting the cheap plastic handles to look like metal (which they do, through the transparent box) is made much worse by the lead weight hidden inside the packaging to make it *feel* like metal in the case. Very misleading packaging, I don't think it should be allowed. Two thumbs down."
4,Nifty. Clever. Playful,"This is a clever little book. The author takes a trivial incident from a day in Paris and tells it in a few dozen different ways, usually in less than 1 page.I got a kick out of it and I was very impressed with how different he could make the same event sound using different stylistic approaches. It's a trip. To be fair though, towards the end of the book I got a little tired and I thought the author was forcing it, coming up with some unreadable takes."
5,It is hard to render Queneau's wit into another language.,"I have not yet read the English translation Barbara Wright made of ""Exercices de style"". Someone else said that she ""stayed true"" to the original version, but I find it hard to believe that she could exactly render Queneau's wit into English. Instead, I exhort anyone who is learning French to read the original version; it is a remarkable opportunity to learn the structure of a foreign language, and to laugh at the same time. Or, if you know Italian a little, try to read the translation by Umberto Eco; as both a semiologist and a writer, he skilfully added new amusing variations on the main theme."
3,"I wanted to like this, really I did","Some of the variations were pretty amusing. Some, such as the juxtapositions of letters and words according to mathematical formulae, were just tedious and added nothing. The ultimate joke was a bit of a letdown.This book is easily read and easily forgotten."
3,not bad - not great,"May not be up to commercial use because some of the hardware is clearly not tough enough to withstand rough handling. On the flipside, it is light enough to be reasonably easy to handle by one self - an asset in home or owner operated shops.The legs want to fold up and are a bit wobbly until I tie a ratcheting tie-down strap between the center hinge pins of the two diagonal braces. Then in becomes near-rock-solid. The diagonals and the associated hardware should be of higher quality.Good value, that is to say if you can actually get one shipped to you in one piece: THE PACKAGING SSUUCCKKSS!!!!! Have had 5 or 6 units show up trashed! For two months, now, I have been unsuccessful at obtaining a second unit to complete a pair - one alone doesn't do me any good.For the above reason I DO NOT RECOMEND anyone order from this company."
3,Average Roller Stand,This is an average roller table. The rollers work fine. The height is adjustable and the feet have leveling screws. The feet and base are a little flimsy and when you fold up the unit; it does not completely fold up thus being hard to move. It handles large sheets of plywood well.
4,Nice mug,"What better time to inspire a positive thought than first thing in the morning? I bought some for myself and some to share as gifts. Delivery was fast, quality appears to be good."
1,Ann Maghee,I was disappointed that the item did not arrive in the lacquered gift box as indicated. I was expecting the lacquered gift box since this was mentioned as part of the product packaging. False advertising.
4,Advice beyond business,"This audio book has words of wisdom from a self-made millionaire who takes a more relaxed approach to life's challenges and situations than most `Type A' success stories. The main focus here is learning to do what you love and creating a career out of it. Some of the lesson topics include: ""Imagine your ideal scene,"" ""Discover your core beliefs, and learn how to change them,"" and ""Grow at your own pace."
3,Great *cheap* 7 slot untensil tray *IF* it arrives undamaged!,"Design:5 stars as there's 7 slots! One each for (1) dinner knives (2) dinner forks (3) soup spoons (4) salad forks, (5) teaspoons, (6) butter knives/sugar spoons/oyster forks & (7) a long slot for the pie server & serving forks & serving spoons.Quality:1 (one) star - wood sides & melanine bottom. Workmanship is VERY poor. Initial delivery had gouged & poorly repaired base as well as broken off pieces of uprights glued to base. Ordered a second in hopes of semi-quality (as I really needed 7 slots & 14"" x 18"" dimension) and that one was OK.Stacks & Stacks customer service:0 (Zero! NADA! Nein! Non!) - Emailed w/ pics day after receipt to specified email address and received NO response after 5 days.........."
4,I'm pleased with it,"I am very pleased with this. It is well made, looks clean and is very functional. It was one of the only ones I could find with as many compartments in the space I had. My only compaint is how it fits into my drawer... it barely fit (more the drawer's fault) and the compartments are set, so I have to have the teaspoons (most used) in the top half (hardest to reach) and the tablespoons on the bottom. I'm hoping in my next apartment that the unit will fit the other direction so I can remedy this limitation. (I'm not sure if it's the unit or my drawer, but I could not get it to fit the other way around. It only just fits in my drawer, because I have a small/old drawer. The tray itself is great except it would be better if the compartments were somehow adjustable."
3,ok,"the quality is ok...however, the tray is too big...i have nowhere to fit it...and the compartiments of the tray are too small, so there aren't a lot of things i can fit in there...oh well...i might end up selling it...i don't really need it..."
5,marco a solis-all the songs,"i like to have all the muzic from Marco A Solis, i am from Romania and a like to know what i most to do for this.Thank you"
4,Sturdy,"Easy to assemble, looks nice, and holds a nice amount of wood. This item is overpriced as far as I am concerned."
5,Good heavy duty bakeware,"I have owned this set for about 3 months now, and I have enjoyed them very much. They are very heavy and thick- and well made. Very durable and they definately live up to what I have come to expect from Cuisinart. $30 well spent."
3,Average bakeware set,"I've had these for over a year now and I have one problem with them, thus the 3 star rating. The bottom of my bakeware set is peeling off.I hand wash and dry these pans right after they've been used. I'm not throwing them around so there's no reason the bottom of them should be peeling or flaking. I don't go over the recommended temperatures either.I'm sure there are other bakeware sets that don't peel, scratch, or flake as easily as this set.I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,It burns everything!,I bought this gift for my sister for X-mas and it was not the greatest gift. I'm glade it was not the only thing I got her. She said that the pans burn everything in a gas stove. Now granted my sister does burn things from time to time but the amount that these pans did was suprising. She will probably never use them again.
2,Better than some but far worse than the best,"I purchased a few of these for our custom fabrication shop, to be honest they were as disappointment from day one. Height adjustment is a two hand affair and not precise as one would think based on the desc. The roller is still pretty light duty and the frame is also flimsy.I just bought a few other heavy stands that amazon now sells by vestil and they kick this stands but for only about $90 depending on height. I am far happier with these other stands for less cash and they can take over 1,000 lbs! Adjustment on these does need an allen wrench but i welded a holder onto the stand and its a non issue now.Vestil STAND-H-HP 14"" Horizontal Deluxe Roller Stand, 27"" - 42"" Height, 1760 lbs Capacity"
4,A Fine Tool,"Its strong and steady. The lock style makes it hard to get dead-on accuracy, but I rarely find that necessary with a support stand. My only real complaint is that during manufacturing, a lot of the white paint got on the threads of the feet so I have to use a wrench to make height adjustments on 3 feet for right now instead of finger-tip adjustments like on the 4th. I do expect the other 3 to loosen up in time though, so its probably not a big deal."
2,Good price but poor quality,"I bought this router to use during my basement remodel because it got decent reviews and was a good price. Dont be fooled by all the positive reviews...this thing sucks. Every time I tried to use it, no matter what bit I used on it, the chuck would loosen and the bit would slip while routering a piece of wood or it would fall out completely. I tightened the chuck on the bit as hard as I could and the same problem occured repeatedly. I have a couple of hitachi drills and a hitachi compound miter saw, both of which work great, but this thing is junk... DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
4,Excellent Router,"I've been using a router for over 30 years and have had good luck with most routers except the craftman which I have had problems with. I bought the Hitachi router to replaced my craftsman. I like the feel and performance of the Hitachi, however there is some drawbacks with it. First, there's no light within the bit area to help you see the work the bits doing while you are using it by hand vs mounted to a table. I had to ensure I had a lot of light while working indoors. Second, the on/off switch isn't on the handle for ease of use. The on/off switch is located at the top of the router. This makes it awkward when using this router by hand. The price and warranty make up for the two drawbacks I've mentioned."
4,I love this router,"I use this router as spindle motor for my cnc router I built. it works very well, I have had no problems with it. I have used it to cut aluminum and some hard woods with good success. The onlything it is missing is a spindle lock to make it easier to change bits."
3,Disappointed,Main problem is the 1/2 inch collet which comes with this router. It's undersized. Getting a 1/2 inch bit in and out is difficult and subjects the user to cuts. Having to pry the bit out with a plier is not the desired method to remove an expensive carbide bit. Called the manufacturer and the rep said they would send a new collet if his supervisor approved. I guess he didn't approve since I never received a new collet. On the plus side the router is lightweight. The on/off switch is not very ergonomic but for $100 I guess you take what you get.
3,Not much muscle!,"I bought this unit to replace one that I burned out making raised panel cuts. I thought I burned the first unit out by doing too many raised panels at once (3). I even made gradual cuts to avoid hogging off too much wood at one time. Since I've started using the replacement I find I'm seeing the same issues- after one panel I've got to give the machine a break because it gets really hot and you can smell the stator cooking!Besides the overheating issue the router is great to work with, easy to set up and smooth. If your doing light work it's fine- if your doing heavy work-like raised panels you might want to avoid this unit-IMHO, of course."
3,Be nice if I could actually use it,"I wanted to use this router for my router table but they have the screws in the base plate so tight I am going to have to drill them out, so I keep putting off using it with the table. Seems to work find free style. Also the manual is of little help for beginners, instructions are the bare basics in three or five different languages. Typical cost saving greed found throughout the global market. What would it cost them for a couple extra pages of instruction in English, 5 cents?"
3,Dust cover,It doesn't come with a dust cover or a hose port (usually just made of a piece of plastic) for the vacumn that you can find with cheaper router.
1,collett,"This router seems well made but has a major flaw. I just recieved it. I tried it out with the 1/2 inch collett tightened fully and while routing some solid surface material (like Corian) the bit came fully out of the chuck and struck me in the leg, causing a large gash.I again tried it with a brand new 1/2 inch straight bit tightened to my max and watched as the bit slid out of the collett. Hitachi is sending a new collett I will keep you informed."
2,Does not work!,"This was supposed to be a variable speed router but, that was not functional on this machine....smelled burned. Bad quality control..............."
4,Seal Team One,"I have read all but one of Dick Couch's books and know him personally. This book is fun to read, shows the reader what it was like to be a SEAL in Vietnam without you personally fighting the bugs, jungle, and Viet Cong. Dick's writing has progressed since this early novel but SEAL TEAM ONE will put you there. Civilians, need to know what it is like to put your life on the line in the dark of night in a terrain you are not familiar with and come back to camp with the adrenalin seeping out after a night ambush patrol. Dick's book, written from first hand experience, is a winner and a keeper for my war book shelf. Jim Misko, author, THE CUT OF PRIDE"
5,Awesome!,"This is by far Russ Taff's best CD. It is an awesome crossover CD with a central theme of Love. It isn't preachy whatsoever. It was put out way before its time. If released today, it would be number one on the charts. The song writing is superb and the recording/musicianship the best. Russ Taff's vocals are moving to say the least. He draws you in to each and every song and paints a picture with his melodies like no other can. If you like excellent song writing, and phenomenal singing, look no further than this CD. You will not be dissappointed."
5,Awesome!,"Shipped fast and this is a great recording by Russ T. cross between rock, country, and rockability. It walks a fine line to even blues! Amazing recording!!"
4,have owned it for years,"I have owned this book for years. It was given to me as a gift. I have read and re-read it many, many times. Some of the annotations are useful and interesting, some not so much. But, the story is one of my favorites and the annotations do more to add than take away, so I recommend it."
1,What a piece of @#@%$#!,"I took this item to Ireland on a trip and after using it for my laptop for no more than about 2 hours, it made a loud ""pop"" sound and smelled like it was burned and it ceased to function after that. This is garbage, do not purchase this item."
5,terrific,so useful and so helpful - everywhere is covered - didn't have to worry if i picked the right converter - make sure not to forget to use an adapter or you can ruin your appliance
2,"Good CD, but....","I liked this CD, it was overlooked by many!My biggest gripe is ""Why Not Take All of Me"".. It's the best song on the CD, but is there an alternate version of the song where we don't have to hear ""The U Dig Band"" being said all through the song. I bought a single of this a long time ago and ""The U Dig Band"" was on it more than the original version.That KILLED an otherwise excellent song.THAT IS SO ANNOYING!!!!P.S. Cato's voice is very reminiscent of Aaron Hall of Guy."
1,Foot bath - don't bother,"It splashed and didn't stay warm. I would have given it 0 stars, but that wasn't an option. I sent it back."
4,Foot JetSpa,I purchased the HoMedics JetSpa for my father for his birthday...he has been using it every night! A great gift!
3,Wow!!!!,I bought this same Homedics Jet spa with heat at Walmart for regular price of $29.97 can't believe they are charging such an outlandish price for this and I am happy with the product.
2,Not Worth the extra money for a few attachments,"I had a smiliar model by homedics but it did not contain the pedicure attachments. I would just soak my feet and use my own pedicure kit. During our move my old foot bath broke and so my husband replaced it with this model. At first I was exited about the pedicure concept. I then realized that it was actaully harder to use the attchments provided then to use my old hand held kit. In order to use the attchemnts you have to be sitting at a certain height. It was hard to find the right chair, couch etc in my house that I didn't feel like i was straining my leg muscles.The foot bath itself is no different then the basic homedics foot bath but this model cost my husband 3 times more.I think the basic model is just fine and I think you get better results giving a manual pedicure then with this foot bath."
1,Don't bother!,"I purchased this product and the bubble/heat feature did not work. I requested a replacement item and amazingly enough, the same feature did not work on the replacement item. I sent the replacement back for a refund but now have been told I can't get a refund only another unit! Which probably also won't function properly. I am very dissatisfied."
2,Junk,"The only thing I asked for Christmas was a foot spa. Be careful what you ask for. Like the other reviewers have stated, it doesn't maintain water temperature AT ALL! The water gets darn near cold within 5 minutes. The extra attachments are a waste. It's an overall COMPLETE disappointment. I should have done more research. Now that I have... I'm taking this back and buying the HotSpa Foot Bath with Water Heat Up. All the reviews from all the websites I've researched say that the HotSpa heats VERY well and you can add salts,and soaks and whatnot to the water. You can find it cheaper than the Brookstone which I understand also maintains water temperature well."
1,Bad product.,"With regards to the HoMedics BL-300:This thing is a horrid product. After only a week, I quit plugging it in because the bubbles/jets are pretty useless and the pedicure attachments are awkward to use and poorly designed.On top of that, the ""bumps"" that are glued (or whatever) to the floor of the unit come off. One of mine did tonight, and I learned the hard way that it was glued over A HOLE in the unit's floor. It took me 1/2 hour to mop all the water up from my den floor. Why on EARTH they'd design it like that is beyond me, and my response will be to NEVER buy anything from HoMedics again. What a piece of junk. If you've bought one, you'd be well advised to make sure your ""bumps"" are secure every time you use it. I've never bought such a disappointing product."
1,"HORRIBLE, AWFUL, DISAPPOINTING, RIDICULOUS!","There are no prosAllow me to share with you how deep your disappointment will be.1. It holds a ridiculously small amount of water2. The water LEAKS EVERYWHERE! I thought mine was defective until I read these reviews and saw that it is a common complaint.3. The attachments are aesthetically pleasing and that is all that they are....they achieve nothing...4. The water DOES NOT HEAT5. You cant use ANY substance in the bath....it will clog, resulting in NO bubbles!I would hope after noticing that this product gets such a poor rating by so many people that you will make an educated decision and proceed further with your search. This is NOT the answer to your foot soaking needs! (I got it as a gift, my poor mother wasted her $)."
1,Leaks water every time I tried to use it.,Whenever you use this product with the bubble feature it will suddenly dump all the water out on the floor! This has happened every time so I can only use it when it is unplugged. It is nothing but a big dishpan. I am so disappointed because my son spent his hard-earned money on it for a gift. He bought it in another state and I don't have the heart to tell him it is defective.Don't buy this product unless you like to mop up water!!
1,Dissatisfied,"In my opinion, HoMedics should go back to the Bubble Bliss tub, where you can have JUST the massage and Heat, there is assolutely NO good reason to have bubble jet that sounds like a Dental drill. Not a good thing.I was totally dissatified with this product and returned the tub, and would like you to be fully refunded.Thank You"
3,Cooled off before he used it ...,"First of all, you can only put a little over an inch of water in this. My husband purchased it, and the first time he tried to use it had difficulty finding an outlet that worked, so only a couple of minutes later, it had already cooled off considerably. Since this does not add heat, it meant he got a cool foot massage.He found it too narrow and difficult to get both of his feet in the unit.It has some nice pluses, including a handle that makes it easy to carry, but it is more of a pedicure style machine than a foot bath and spa.If you decide to get this, run your water TOO HOT, so that when you are ready you might have a toasty warm one for a short time.I'm keeping this around though, for hot summer days when I want to cool my feet off ;-). And next time, I'm picking out the foot spa!"
1,Spend a little more for something better.,"I had been looking for a foot bath/spa for a while now. I did some looking here on amazon, and decided i would try to find something here in town, rather than order online. That was a mistake, I picked this unit up at walmart. It worked pretty well for a week, it wasn't great, but for the price it did the job. I was using it earlier this evening, and i noticed the bubbles were not working. I could hear the motor going, but no bubbles, then noticed the water level was dropping. As quite a few other reviewers stated, this thing leaks out of the 2 slots on the front bottom. I would return it, but the box and packaging are all out by the curb for trash pick up. I pretty much just threw away $30 dollars as well, I wouldn't trust this thing again."
1,Water...is...everywhere!,"Bought this for my husband thinking he'd need some relaxation after a job spent all day on his feet, unfortunately sopping up a gallon of lukewarm water from the living room carpet isn't as relaxating as it sounds. The powerful jets are anything but, the water cools after a few minutes, and then there's the lovely aspect of it leaking from holes in the bottom. Really, who puts holes in the bottom of a device that holds liquid?? Run far far away from this and spend a little more for a lot more quality. Heck, even that pail of water mentioned in another one star review is a better alternative!"
1,Very Unhappy with product,Bought the JetSpa Footbath. Leaked with bubble maker. Spinning pedicure did not work & water got cold.Plan to return it to Target today & hope they refund my $. Do not waste money on this product
1,Jet Spa Footbath units leak,"I purchased a Homedics JetSpa Footbath BL-300-1 unit at Target. It leaked all over the floor the first time I tried to use it. I took it back and exchanged it for another unit, thinking it was defective. The second unit did the exact same thing. I won't be trying another one. Don't have time to keep cleaning up its messes!"
1,Got a big pile of towels?,"As others mentioned, the first time we tried to use this, it leaked water all over the floor - definitely out of the bottom somehow. We'll be returning it tomorrow."
1,Jet Spa Footbath Model BL-300,SAVE YOUR MONEY...The first time I used it it leaked all over the carpet and I can't figure out why. The water leaks from the two slots on the bottom. I'm afraid to use it again and since it was a gift I can't even take it back for an exchange.
3,"series needs some remastering love, but it is still the whole show on 5 discs","I have always wanted the complete show on DVD. I never thought it would happen then....BAM! It shows up. Problem is that these cartoons on these DVDs are simlar to recording a show on VHS and rewatching the tape, the quality is terrible by todays standards. No remastering here, its bare bones quality and the complete show on discs. You would think that H.B wouldve cleaned it up a bit and then released it. So it comes down to this, how much do you LOVE the show? When I answered that question, I bought it. It is a part of my childhood and it feels good to have the show sitting in my DVD/Blu Ray collection and maybe someday they might come with the Blu Ray. But remember, if you are considering buying it, the quality isnt great, it is kinda like watching the show back in the 90s again. But it is the ENTIRE series on 5 discs."
4,good gun,the tippmann 98 is a really good gun and never chops.But its kind of heavy with the tank.But besides that its never broke its a very durible marker.And get a longer barrel because the one it comes with sucks
4,The last CD from Big Sugar,Sadly this is going to be the last CD from Big Sugar (which is going their separate ways after their tour this summer) but they have gone out on a high with a great CD and live album. The live disc (run) is a little better than their best of disc (run) but it is a must buy for all Big Sugar fans.
5,Would you look at these hits?,"If there's one thing about Big Sugar, it's that they sure knew how to write hits. If you're a fan of classic rock, rock, alternative rock, or any kind of rock, you'd like these songs. In fact, you've probably heard them on a radio and not known who they were by. Now you know: Big Sugar."
3,Great but for how long?,"I love these things. My wife drinks maybe a half glass of wine at a sitting, so I am often left with most of a bottle to handle myself. I usually have no more than a couple of glasses and am left with the major portion of a bottle. The Vac-U-Vin has been an excellent solution to my plight. It is very simple to use. It gives you a distinctive ""clink"" when you have pumped enough and preserves wine for at least a week. The problem, and it is a big problem, is that the Vac-U-Vin gadgets wear out very quickly. Of course, I use mine a lot. I find they work very well for a couple of months (if used daily or almost daily) and then begin to stick to the point that they become useless and must be replaced. On the plus side, they are relatively cheap, so getting a new one costs less than a decent merlot or pinot noir. From here on I will buy two at a time, so that I always have a spare when one of them crashes on me. Bottom line is that the Vac-U-Vin works very well but not for long."
1,Vin-U-vac Poorly Made,"I received a Vin-U-Vac for Christmas 2004 and in spite of the fact I have used it only a half dozen times, the suction creating device has failed. It is a poorly made piece of equipment and I will not be wasting money on a replacement."
4,When will The Assisi Underground be released on DVD?,"""The Assisi Underground"" is a 1984 feature that stars Ben Cross as a determined and courageous Catholic priest who risks his own life to rescue thousands of persecuted Jews fleeing the Nazis in WW II Italy. If I'm not mistaken, this is a fact-based story and also stars James Mason and Maximillian Schell. Another movie that also dealt with a Catholic priest aiding Jews and POWs during WW II in Italy was 1983's ""The Scarlet and the Black"" starring Gregory Peck as a heroic Vatican priest and Christopher Plummer as the ruthless Nazi officer-in-charge.I watched this on television many years ago and found it a riveting, albeit slow-moving feature. I do wish they would reissue this on DVD so I can add it to my collection of Holocaust-themed dramas."
5,Really great true story,"I had first purchased this as a video long ago, and was elated to see that Amazon was offering the dvd version. Because this is such an excellent film, I wanted to make sure I wouldn't lose it--as can easily happen with a video tape. The film is the story of how a simple Franciscan friar, under orders from his bishop, was able to shelter and provide counterfeit documents for a number of Italian Jews during the Nazi occupation of Italy. Among these Jews, was a certain professor who was being urgently sought by the Nazis, because the professor's knowledge of cutting edge technology could give the Germans an important military atvantage over the Allies. The film features movie legends James Mason, Maximillian Schell, Ben Cross and Irene Pappas. Really great film, and best of all, it's TRUE!"
4,Descriptive and to the point,Keegan writes an excellent biography here. He traces the life of one Hitler's better generals. i recommend it to all who enjoy reading military history.
5,Castle,Every kid that comes to my house loves to play with this castle. Glad I bought it. It was the most reasonable one I found anywhere.
2,cheap,"You get what you pay for with these silhouettes. I bought these thinking I was getting a deal on a decent set, but they are not life-like and under sized. If you are looking for the cheapest way to goose hunt without any recognition to quality I suggest this product. But if you want to get birds on the ground, look elsewhere."
1,Pedestal Roller?,Spend a few extra dollars and get a roller that actually supports your project. This thing is junk. Its not sturdy and the roller comes assembled incorrectly.
5,Worth the expense,"I bought this soap over a year ago, through a retail store locally. I love it. It's not drying, which for me is a big plus, given that my skin tends to be dry. And it lasts a long time. Granted, I did not use daily, but the soap did not dissolve away in the shower like many do. And the scent is clean. All in all, a perfect soap."
5,I never expected much from soundtracks but this is great!!!,"I had never even heard of Gary Hoey or the movie The Endless Summer 2 and still haven't seen it. When I first borrowed the CD from my uncle I emediatly started skiping through the songs and found a few favorites. I think the best on the Album are ""Low Rider"" ""Walkin the nose"" ""Linus and lucy"" ""drive"" and ""la rosa negra"". If the CD were made up of just those 5 songs i'd still pay twice as much for it. You will probally have your favorites like I did but you will really apriciate it more if your just sit down and listen to the whole thing and take in all teh different styles and the talent. Bottom line, buy it."
5,Love the movie....the cd adds to it...Gary Hoey is awesome!,Wow. What a great CD! Makes you so stoked you want to grab your board and hit the waves.
3,Disappointed,"I was rather disappointed with this CD. Like Music Fan from San Bernardino, I bought the CD primarily for the theme song from the movie. It's a remix and is a real letdown. The rest of the CD is okay, but doesn't make up for the disappointment from the theme song."
3,Wait for You in the best one on here.,I had this on tape back in the day. I loved the song Wait for You. I remember rewinding my cassette so many times to hear this song over and over. It's still an exceptional song today. The rest of the album (to me) was rather forgettable.
2,Not a great CD !,Sure Jason Bonhams Dad was the almighty drummer for Led Zeppelin but this cd is not that great and never thrilled me at all.Aside from the fact that Jason got a singer that sounds alot like Robert Plant and wanted to cash in on that Led Zepelin sound this is one lame CD.People were always ragging on Great Whites Jack Russell because he sounds a lot like Robert Plant but because Jason Bonham is in the band it's ok for him to have the Robert Plant clone.The music and tunes are so-so but I wouldnt waste my money on here to own a copy of this cd.
5,Blastman is Rock & Roll True to Form,"After listening to Blastman once through I thought to myself this is what would happen if I could get The Ventures, George Thorogood and Johnny Cash together for a jam session in my garage. The band has a very unique flavor, yet there is no mistaking the heritage of rock, blues and country all throughout this CD. If you need lots of slow-paced music scattered throughout, then you just don't have want it takes to appreciate the driven lyrics and music of Blastman. This is rock and roll as pure as you can hope to find. Thanks guys--MLH."
2,Sloppy,"""Renaissance Florence"" written by Gene Brucker is full of really brilliant information. No doubt, Brucker is extremely well-versed in this subject...but the organization of this book is HORRENDOUS! I had to do a paper on this book for my class, and trying to go back and find information was nearly impossible! There is really no rhyme or reason that I can see to how this book's information is compiled."
3,Dry,"I purchased this book because I wanted an overview of Florence during the Renaissance and the reviews I read about this book were all positive. Though I did learn things from this book I did not enjoy reading it. It was very dry and it didn't talk about what I expected it would - the artistic side of the Renaissance. It did start to go into it towards the end, but not in any sort of depth. Let's put it this way - I was a history major and expected this book to be somewhat academic, but I also expected the author to make the history come alive. Many historical books I have read make me excited to turn the page and see what comes next, this one did not."
4,Decent splatter screen,Our old splatter screen had to be replaced because the mesh wire separated from the hoop after a few uses. This one seems sturdy and secure so far. The only downside is that the handle is metal and sometimes gets to hot to touch. Overall good.
3,Bought site unseen - but made in China,I bought the Lodge Splatter Screen sight unseen because of Lodge's reputation for its US made cookware. When this screen arrived i see that it is Made In China. This may not be a negative to you but for the price i could buy 3 splatter screens at Bed Bath and Beyond also made in China. I am willing to pay more for US made products because they are of superior quality to chinese made products and don't want to re buy the item 10 times when it breaks which without fail Chinese made cookware has done in my experience. You may be satisfied with this product but for its price it is 3x what you can get at a discount store and of no better quality. Because of this I will second guess purchasing from Lodge in the future.
5,Clean Up a Snap,"It makes clean up a snap by keeping splattering grease, oil and liquids in the pan or pot where they belong. Works well and is well made."
1,Very Poor quality,"I am a big fan of Lodge. I have many Lodge pieces including two dutch ovens, BBQ, many pans, grills. But this item, was so poorly made the screen even wobbles where the handle is attached. Washing is not joy either because the water gets inside the tubes holding the mesh just from running hot water over the screen to brush off oil. The glue attaching the screen is messy and is well outside where it should be. Overall, the cheap products I have seen in the grocery store for $6 are better quality than this. I guess this is what happens when a great company like Lodge decides to start making their products in China."
4,every kitchen where frying is done MUST HAVE one of these,"I wish I had had this with me when I started cooking. It would have saved me a lot of criticism about technique. This worked beautifully when I was frying up burgers. In the moment it took me to grab it, I had a nice array of oil dots around the pan.I use this all the time."
3,Splatter Screen,"I bought this screen to replace one my daughter ""borrowed"". It seems flimsy, flexes, and is not of the quality of my last screen even though it was 3x more expensive."
2,Flimsy,"This thing is very flimsy at the point where the handle connects to the circle containing the screen. It seems so fragile, I'm almost afraid to use it.Maybe it will last but I'm not betting on it.My only consulation is that it was one of 4 for 3 promotion items so I can at least tell myself I got it for free."
4,My Little Baby Born,"Great doll! My daughter loves playing Mommy and this is one of the best ""babies"" she has. Very life like for a 5 year old. Hard to find a change of clothes for, but still a great baby doll."
5,Very nice profile of a small country,"I really love this series. The ""people,"" ""land,"" and ""culture"" format is terrific. This is one of the few in the series that combines two of the topics (People and Culture) in a single book, but it's still very interesting. It contains plenty of photos and has good information on the people, history, customs, food, holidays, music, etc.I teach ESOL and more of my students come from El Salvador than any other country. I really appreciate that they included such a small country in their series. (Actually, they included most of the countries that my students come from, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Peru.)The book appears to be out of print now, and I wish they would bring it back into print. It's really a good read."
3,"Some real good, some eh...",This is one of those CDs where you have to be in the right frame of mind prior to popping it in the CD player. I enjoy some songs very much but want to skip over others. Definitely a niche CD.
3,Pretty Good,"Joe Sample is my all time favorite Jazz Piano Player.I love the Crusaders Music big time.Joe Sample has a Signature sound that has always moved me.this Album starts out banging then it has a few tracks I can take or leave.but Joe's Signature tone&chord Structuring is timeless.I bought this tape a long time ago&was Grooving to it recently.I tend to favor His 70's solo Projects&Of course the Crusaders work He did when Wayne Henderson was with the crew.Stewart Levine who Produced the Classic 70's Crusaders Albums is on board here.""Mystery child"" is my Joint."
4,Data Binding Coverage is Excellant,This book provides the best coverage on data binding(30 pages) I have yet seen. This chapter alone makes the book a worthy purchase.
4,You'll Wish Your Cigarettes Were This Smooth,"This entire CD, with the exception of the eventually grating Dirty Harry theme, is a very pleasant aural experience. Like a refreshing liquorice cordial, it has a strong nose of rhythm and a creamy smooth guitar being held together by pepperings of horn and the pleasantly mellow bite of James Taylor's keyboards and organ. There is some repetition of grooves, but it's overall a good feeling, since the groove is good enough to bear repeating without appearing flat or hollow.This CD has stood the test of time well and can serve as excellent chill out or driving around at night music. It's very difficult to not like James Taylor, as his music is always soulful and easy to digest. You know good music when you hear it, even if you're not a musician, so you'll know when you hear this that it's good music."
4,Chom nom nom nomsky,"The book so far is great, it has a perspective of critical mass for the United States of America. It has very eye opening informtaion. Of course it has it's bias but that is also why I had an anti Chomsky book as well. It is a difficult read at first if you've never read Chomsky or even were interested politics but once you get familiar with his style of writing then you'll enjoy the read."
1,A well written venomous compilation of lies,"He knows how to write, but unfortunately his grasp of reality is weak. All the ills of the world can be attributed to the USA, where Chomsky has gotten rich and successful. The self delusion in the book is amazing."
1,Chomsky needs a course on international law,"It was amazing to me this guy wrote a book about the US not ""obeying"" international courts, or about the Geneva Convention. I was hoping for some insite into the ideas of the left and all I found was some misleading facts wrapped around out right hate for America. He should read the Geneva Convention before he writes a book about it. A little research on international law, and international courts would be nice too. After anyone reads this book I would suggest research both to see how far off Chomsky really is. It was unbelievable how far from realality this book is."
2,The bias of a Chompsky,"Mr. Chompsky never fails me. Whenever I want to read something that makes me dislike America, I can count on Noam. His failure to be honest in this book is apparent from about page 5 onward. His positive reviews are pretty much canned and produced by the Jim Jones style followers he courts on college campuses. I give this book only 2 stars. One star because he uses a few big words and another star because in actually writing a book and marketing it, he is contributing to capitalism. Other than that, his rhetoric is tedious."
1,Chomsky -- remixed!!!,"It must be a source of constant frustration to Noam Chomsky that he must reside and eke out a living in an undemocratic ""failed"" state. Perhaps this is his rejoinder to those who would accuse him of voting with his feet.Appeals to the U.N. Charter, international law, and the sanctity of sovereign states make their appearance -- again. With the possible exception of Margret and H.A. Rey, nobody is better at repackaging the same themes over and over again with only new cover art and title.Chomsky is correct, in that the strict respect for the sovereignty of states provides the best path to ending international war. Yes, we get it. As for the wars sovereign states wage internally on their own citizens (e.g., Sudan, North Korea, Rwanda, Burma, Nazi Germany), Chomsky's solution is to change the subject. A wagging finger pointed back at the U.S. is the universal gesture for doing nothing, when real suffering is at hand."
5,Outstanding!,"A must read for those interested in survival: for themselves, their families and the brotherhood of man."
4,good read,"this book is packed with information and a lot of valid points are made and it really does make you second guess the actions particularly foreign policy of the american government. Some of this is tough to get through, not always the most fascinating but if you like other noam political works this is for you."
2,"Don't be fooled - SAME book as ""Dialogue""","This is the SAME book titled ""Dialogue"" that was published by Writers Digest Books. Read the reviews for ""Dialogue"" (ASN 0898793491) if you want to know more about THIS book, because the content and approach are the same.Although he's added longer examples than in the previous book, he insists on using the same self-consciously unfunny, unhelpful and even confusing ""Socratic dialogue"" between himself and a fictional ""student"" character.He's also added a 4-page introduction defending this choice and bragging about the original book's reprints and translations. (So I suspect he's seen the reviews at Amazon. You'd think he'd learn something from that.) Repackaging alone does not improve this book one bit."
1,"Near 100% Copy of His Earlier Book on Dialogue, and Still Bad !","* This is a rip-off if you already have the previous version.* Still uses the same useless, and poorly done, 'Socratic' conversation method.* You will spend more time trying to figure out what the heck he is trying to put across than you will actualy learning about Dialogue.* You will go crazy trying to find the actual examples of the concepts that are mixed in with dialogue that does NOT relate to the topic.I would not recommend this book to *anybody* that is trying to learn about the forms of Dialogue or the usage of those forms. Just about any other book would be better."
1,Who is this book for?,"As a screenwriter, I borrowed this book from the library and returned it quickly. The author demonstrates his own lack of skill in creating dramatic and purposeful dialogue by creating a fictional character for him to banter with througout the book. Their discussions are terribly unfunny, unclever and quickly become tedious and annoying. I kept asking myself as I read, ""who is this book for?"" as the ""insights"" and topics presented are of no value to any adult. And so, I can only imagine this book is for grade school students to increase their awareness of different elements that go into a dramatic text."
4,Good quality,"The copy I recieved was in the condition advertised, and maybe even a little better. The order arrived within the specified time frame. I would order from them again. Also, the book itself is a great piece of Dalit literature."
1,supplier not fast enough,"Until date I haven't received the item that I am writing about. Therefore, how can I share my opinion. But generally I have no problem with my orders from Amazon, except when it is from a third party supplier.Regards,Ahmed DashtiDohaQatar"
4,Good deal,"This book along with the digital upgrade still came out to be cheaper than buying the book from a university bookstore. This book also happens to be huuuuuge so the digital upgrade is very convenient, although the amazon reader still has several kinks."
2,keep looking,"As a neuroscience graduate student, I was extremely excited to read this book and to keep it as a reference but unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations for either task. Given Kandel's outstanding contributions to our understanding of learning, I hoped his book would have similar standards. Most notable of several flaws is that the individual chapters, each being individually authored, were poorly edited and did not provide an integrated picture of the field. Further, some graphs were mislabeled, and in several chapters, this text engaged in the annoying practice of introducing and using new terminology early on and then defining this jargon at the end of the chapter. The material on vision was thorough but audition and the vestibulochlear systems were very skimpy. If you are interested in learning anything about motor systems, I'd recommend you pass this book up for Michael Zigmond's Fundamentals of Neuroscience."
4,Complete overview of the field,"I am an undergraduate neuroscience major. I chose Principles Of Neural Science on my own, because I wanted a higher-level text than the course required. The textbook provides a good overview of the many different aspects of neuroscience, from synaptic transmission to perception to development. It is easy-to-read, not dense like some textbooks. I find it especially helpful to read a chapter of the text before attempting to dive into a research article. My only criticism is that it refers to material from other chapters as though it should already be learned, as though the book is meant to be read in order and not used as a reference. With 63 chapters, I am not sure this is appropriate. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this text."
4,Excellent resource!,"Kandel's monumental 4th Edition text is chock-full of updated figures, pictures, and descritive mechanisms within its 9 parts.This textbook would function extremely well as the primary resource for an intermediate-level Neuroscience course (graduate school).It is well-organized and adequately referenced. The histological figures, MRI scans, and related clinical measures are especially impressive and helpful for supporting the information presented in the text.This textbook does a fine job with balancing basic information with highly technical concepts. However, and understandably so, due to the voluminous, ever-expanding and ever-evolving nature of neural science, the text does not contain much regarding synaptic plasticity nor circadian rhythms.That said, I still think this textbook is one of the most valuable tools that you could include in your academic armamentarium."
5,Great Reference Book,"The text is extremely clear and to the point. The diagrams are also simple to understand. Every major topic in neurosci is discussed, allowing you to get an excellent foundation such that you could read any recent publications on that topic and understand completely what the authors are referring to."
5,Impressive for a textbook,"As far as textbooks go, this has to be one of the best that I have come across...and I have come across quite a few. The material is divided into closely related sections, and the text is clear and to the point in its explanation. Not much filler text or needless material. The diagrams are pretty clear and well positioned in the sections also."
5,Perfect Fit,"Went in just right, no gaps. The right color match for my tan carpet. The front mats fit perfect also. They arrived in the same week they were ordered."
1,Total Junk,Worst piece of guitar garbage I have ever purchased. The servo motors don't even have enough power to turn the pegs. I tried three sets of brand new batteries. Don't waste your money on this thing. Just get a normal meter tuner. They're cheaper and they always work.
3,You may have to return it....,"I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday, and he was extremely happy with it!!Then he tried to use it.The tuner would not tune the nut and it would make weird noises. Sometimes it wouldn't even turn on. I told him i would return it back to musician's friend. One good thing about Musician's friend is that their customer service is extremely helpful and their warranty service is very, very good (they have a 45 day return policy). Im still in the process of exchanging it, since i figured it was probably defective and i could always return it again if i so chose.All im saying is that you're doing this at your own risk (as it always is with buying things over the internet). If you dont want to have to take the chance of having it be defective or just not working, this product is not for you."
4,Gives you exactly what you need!!,All the information you need to find in this one book. History in the making
3,P'Taah - Staring At The Sun,"Disappointing. After the beauty of COMPRESSED LIGHT, STARING AT THE SUN seems much too much like Brann's other alias, the Ananda Project. Indeed, many of the chord progressions and synth pads on this album are identical to the Ananda Project albums. Terrance Downs' vocals -- as good as they are -- lend a somewhat bland R&B vibe that aren't present on COMPRESSED LIGHT. Towards the end, ""Arise"" and ""Surrendering"" begin to reclaim some of the personality so prevalent in P'Taah's earlier work, but it comes a tad too late. Let's hope Brann's able to regain his footing."
4,Using it for Formula,"So we use this primarily to mix formula-- it boils, keeps the water warm (a little too warm at 140 degrees, the coolest option, but you can cool the baby bottle full of water further in a cup of cold water in 5 minutes). I like it. Only had it for a few months but definitely makes life more convenient. At $100+ a pop, however, you better really need warm water quick :), which is why this is perfect for parents of babies who use powdered formula!"
2,Everything is good except for the water pump,Everything was great until the water pump died after about 2 years of daily use. We now have to use a cup to scoop the water out. Not worth the money we paid for it
4,Superb,"This ia a wonderful book. I read one review that claims it was no good and couldn't finish reading it. I can't see that. I read this book in 3-days. I could not put it down for nothing. I was so anxious to see what happened next to Rain. I find this book to be very good and I encourage everyone to read it through. Do not put it down to collect dust. Believe me, after you get through the first few chapters you will have a hard time putting it down. VC Andrews has never wrote a book that is no good. She has and will always inspire me. Way to go VC !"
3,It's ok...,"..but not NEARLY as good as the other VC Andrews books.. I don't really like the fact that this book is placed in ""our time"". The reason I love VC Andrews other books is because they are set in different times, such as the Landry series which is my favorite."
4,A Good book!,"All and all, V.C Andrews, Rain was a good book. Rain spent all her life in the ghetto when a closely guarded secret comes out and things start going downfall. Her dear sister Beni gets into to trouble and Rain has problems with a certain group of girls. After Beni is murdered and Rain is attacked, her ""Mama"" decides to give her back to her real family for safety. Now Rain is in a totally different enviroment surrounded by people of cuture and money. Will she ever win the true love and respect that she yearns for? Does she have to continue to live in a world of lies? Read the book. It's a good buy. Although the story line is very similiar to an earlier book Dawn, it has originality and is very interesting, and I'm happy that this character is African American (Yes!). If you havent read this book than read it now! It's good."
2,Déjas-vu!!!,"This book is so similar to Dawn, except it's a black girl who live the story. I know some peoples really enjoyed this book but me it took me a long time to get into it. I don't say don't read it, if you are a big vc andrews fan you may like it but me I really thought it was too similar to Dawn and find it boring. I like much more the real vc andrews book, not the GW one, he really getting boring."
3,"Not bad, but a little too similar","This was a good book, enough to keep me reading until the end, although it was VERY similar to Dawn, from the Cutler Family series, right down to some of the names used. It just didn't have that same sparkle that some of the other, older books have. Overall, good enough to keep you occupied, but nothing really new."
4,"My review for ""Rain"" By V.C Andrews.","""Rain"" a refreshenly new twist on past series that V.C. Andrews has published was very exciting. I found it to be very cultavating. I was unable to put it down. It showed how dramatic the opposite side of the tracks can be, with realistic results. In turn it also showed how cold and indifferent the upperclass can be. After reading this noval I had a new outlook on the importance of teaching your children the value of family."
1,Am I wrong for wanting to slap Rain?,"C'mon give us some credit. All Rain is Dawn via an African-American girl. As a African-American I found this book(and broken wings) highly insulting. What is V.C. Andrews ghost writer trying to say? Perhaps he should find Mr.Peabody and his wayback machine and go back to 1950 where he belongs. Do all African-Americans live in the ""hood""? Do they all read on a third grade level? C'mon do some research think of something new. Don't insult us we'd like a little change up. You can't just take V.C. Andrews novels and rewrite them into every other book you've made. The only V.C. like novel was Melody and that's still not saying much. How long are they going to keep this writer? At least take him to writing class so he can get some new ideals. As for the story of rain (sigh) Just read Dawn. It's just like Dawn. In fact don't bother buying any other novel. They are all the same Just replace the names."
3,rain rain go away,"this is the first book in the hudson series. it's about how rain finds out the truth about her family. she is quickly moved from the poorest of neighborhoods to the richest.i am a fan of v.c. andrews, but not of this book. i find that the book doesn't prepare you for the rest of the series. there is alot of unneeded jibberish. like beni. what really is her point? she doesn't really have a need in the book. roy is pointless, but not as pointless as beni. i've decided not to read the rest of the series at the moment for fear of falling asleep."
5,good leson learned,V.C. Andrews was a great auther I am disappointed that she is no longer with us. Her books give a verey important lesson especially for kids like me who are adopted. the lesson is sometime your situation could be worst and be careful for what you wish for. everything that glitters is not gold.
4,"a refreshing change from the miniseries, but . . .","I have to agree with the majority of the reviews. This is a nice change of pace after the miniseries and ""Melody"". I did notice, however, the similarities between ""Dawn"" and ""Rain"". I hope there is a little more originality; that is I hope Rain will have a love interest besides the man she thought was her brother.Very good plot, however. The supporting characters are very strong and serve more of a purpose than they have in the most recent books. I heartily recommend this book to any Andrews fan."
2,okay,"I liked parts of this book. The characters were pretty run of the mill V.C. Andrews, but I liked the message it sent out at the beginning of the book, when Rain wasn't afraid to be different even though everyone thought she was stuck up and she didn't fit in. I also liked how she didn't come across as bratty and spoiled like the wildflowers. But then the second part got boring and even though Rain was in a better environment, she still seemed stuck up to me, so I really didn't like her character that much, and the plot seemed to borrow from every other V.C. novel that's been written."
3,not very supsenseful,"This was very much like other series. Poor girl goes to live with rich family. The only neat thing was the grandmother was nice to her. The ghost writer has used the incest theme with Roy and the actual half-brother. The mother refuses to acknowledge the kid for fear of losing everything. The wicked person is the aunt here and her character is not well developed nor is the half sister. We can except in the next book the possibility of Rain turning up pregnant and grandma bailing her out. She meets her dad in England and another possible pass from both Roy and Brody. And the aunt and half sister, once the secret is out, (the aunt knows) to make her life hell. I was disappointed at the predictablity. I have to wonder how much of this story line is really VC Andrews idea."
2,not again?,"at first, Rain seemed to be strong and confident but suddenly the writer lets her fall into a situations that i think should not have happened so soon because of the characteristics she was given and the morals she supposedly had. I personally was disappointed because every book is the same story and no one seems as strong as they should be and there is never any happy endings. I will continue to read these books because of the VC Andrews name but I think the author should make some changes"
1,ALL BLACK GIRLS BEWARE,"V.C. Andrews should never write a book coming from a black persons view ever again. I was insulted by the way she depicts black people. First of all, Rain is sooooo special and beautiful because she is half white. Her mother was a rich white woman who couldn't keep her half black baby. (Why did she have to mess w/ a black man anyways?)Rain's new parents have been paid to keep her. (Are all black people so low?) Rain's other brother and sister are just so messed up in thier lives, but Rain- who came up in the same envirorment- is near perfect and not like anbody else. If you can get passed this horrible description of the black race then read the book.V.C. Andrews completly ignored the fact that thier is soooo much culture and pride in the black community. The 'hood' isn't just crazy black people running the streets and working hard for nothing."
1,Save your money,"After experiencing a moment of nostalgia for the days of Flowers in the Attic and Petals on the Wind, I impulsively purchased a copy of Rain. Big mistake. Apologies to all of the VC Andrews fans out there, but I must say that the majority of the books released via the ghostwriter have been mediocre. The author never expanded beyond a plot outline and Rain, Roy, et. al. came out as caricatures rather than characters. Also, as someone who used to live in DC, I must say that the depiction of the Georgetown area was completely off. It was as if no background was done on location at all. I would be quick to forgive these details if the story had delivered...but it simply didn't. As much as I would like to...I'm not even able to vote this as a favorable ""guilty pleasure"" read."
1,A Cliche Andrews/Ghostwriter Soap Opera,"I admit the V.C. Andrews/Ghostwriter series do hold one's interest. The books are like cotton candy -- appealing to look at, but leaving little of substance. The formulaic Andrews is as follows: 1) Shadowy, sinister adult females 2) Protagonist is always a young female with an artistic talent (in Rain's case, acting) 3) Sooner or later the protagonist has sexual relationships prior to reaching adulthood 4) a plethora of nature related metaphors 5) a stupid expression in the books that has come to irk me personally -- ""putaway heart"" 6) Twins appear in most of the Andrews/GW books 7) Incestuous relationships between brother & sister, or people raised as brother and sister -- (Cathy & Chis), (Dawn & Jimmy), (Heaven & Tom -- luckily they didn't take their relationship to a sexual level), (Ruby & Paul) and now Rain and Roy. Cliche. I agree with a previous reviewer who expressed disappointment in this book. Add mine as well."
2,Not for Blacks or Teens....,"This book is alright. The plot seems a little too familiar, though. Yet,first, I like Rain cuz she's a strong and nice person, but she's kinda vain cuz she's half-white (cuz ur half-white, ur all that?). Also, she's a little ho! Look: in ""Rain,"" she gets drunk & drops her [...] for some lame guy she barely even knows; in the second book, she has a quickie with a guy who likes her; in the third book, she has premarital sex with her hubby-to-be, Austin. Also in ""Rain"" she lets Roy feel her up, even though she dislikes it. And her half-brother Brody likes her. Gross. Next, I hate that blacks are misrepresented/misjudged in the series and some of the characters are racist! Last, whites are shown in this series to be black people's ""Great White Hope!"" Thus, this book neeeds a lot of fine-tuning and it could be better. Much better."
2,"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle?","I have been reading V.C. Andrews' books every since I was in junior high. I would invade the bookstores to see if her new releases came out. The people in the bookstore know me by name. When I read Rain I was deeply disappointed. There were some good parts of the book. I did like the fact that the grandmother wasn't a cynical old witch and that she admired Rain's mother for bringing her up with morals. But it was the same plot used over and over and over again. I agree with most of the reviewers that gave a poor rating on this book. V.C. Andrews must be rolling in her grave to see her pride and joy decline in such a droll fashion. What happen to the thrilling writing and the edge of your seat suspence. Books like Flowers in the Attic and My Sweet Audrina. If you are a novice to V.C. Andrews books I suggest you start with Flowers in the Attic and work your way down. You'll see how her writing style was fresh and full of wonder and not where it is: Reduced, Reused and Recycled."
4,Waiting for the next one!,"I really enjoyed this book and I am waiting for the next one ofthe ""Hudson Series"" to come out so I can continue with thestory. I love all of V. C. Andrews' books! I have never read one that I didn't like!"
3,Far too much like Dawn's story,"The first half of the book is very enthralling. The situation is more desperate than usual in recent VC books, because the main character is actually in danger. However, the setup of the story is too much like that of the Cutler series. Worth reading, but we can only hope the next books will offer the readers something new and different."
4,Rain Review,"I thought this book was really good! I read the whole thing in one sitting. True, the plot and happenings in the book are very similar to V. C. Andrews other books, but it was still good. Rain seems to be a strong character (except for her one moral slipup) and shows that just because someone is from a ghetto slum doesn't mean that they are necessarily a bad person or a person with ""loose morals"" as the book says. I liked that there really wasn't an ending to this book. I can't wait for the next one to come out to see what happens to Rain!"
3,"Okay read, but flawed.","After the decently-written Logan series, Andrew Neiderman wrote two mini-series (which were not awful, but not VCA-ish) and I was glad when he went back to writing a regular series. But I was disappointed. This was lacking in the same dark feel and mystery of the real VCA books as well as the three full series Mr. Neiderman wrote. (Granted, the Melody series was a bit different, but it was considerably better than the Rain series)The problem wasn't that Rain was biracial or anything like that. The problem was the way everyone was portrayed, and the fact that it became obvious that Mr. Neiderman just wasn't trying as much anymore. The characters are more two-dimensional, and the plot, after Rain is reunited with her real mother, just becomes boring. The rest of the Hudson series is just as mildly amusing but ultimately disappointing, but the Willow/DeBeers series was even worse, and it was all a downward spiral after that."
3,Read better,This book was ok but I miss the style of writing that she wrote in Flowers in the Attic that has to be my favorite book of all times. I have always enjoyed reading the book even thou in the past couple of years I've lost the passion for them that I use to have. I remember as a teen running into the bookstores at the mall and asking if she had a new book and buying and taking it home and reading in a week because I took in every word she wrote and loved it. But now the books to me are just something there for me to read. This book is good the charactors were decent I liked Rain in the novel but wasn't a big fan of Beni and so forth. I'll always continue to read her books untill I get so bored with them I will have the heart to part with them. Till then looking somewhat forward to the next book.
4,Rain,"I really liked this book. I have been reading her books for a really long time. When I found out that she had died and someone else was going to be writing them i was a little up set. Anyhow this book was good if you have read her others and like VC Andrews. But a lot of her books are the same. They almost all include some sort of insest and are all kind of the same. This book reminded me of Dawn. The way her parents were poor and not really her parents. I mean they didn't do a good job describing DC at all. I live there and it is not at all the way it was discribed. But like i said, if you like her books then you will like it. My personal favorite book was Ruby."
3,Rain was..well...,"During the first chapter of this book I sighed and said to myself, ""Why does EVERY black character HAVE to come from the ghetto?"" I am African-American myself and I don't act stuck-up just because I don't come from the ghetto, like the author kind of portrayed some people to be. Besides that sterotype, and a few other minor flaws, I enjoyed the book. Even though it seemed to be a bit boring a times, I will be looking out for LIGHTNING STRIKES to see if it turns out to be better or worse."
2,"Great, but...","I love this organizer. My son and daughter are great with it, and in the year that we've owned this, it has never fallen over. It also looks great, the colors are bright and my kids (who tend to destroy the things they touch some-how) have not scratched it once! MY only complain is that it does not sit the way the picture shows. I put it together and somehow the bins do not sit the way they do in the picture. They just kind of hang on the front bars, and therefore fall through very easily. So, that tends to be an easy mess maker. Other than that, I am thrilled with this!"
1,weak,let it go is the best song on the disc.come the title track has a cool vamp and horn parts but this disc is lifeless and forgettable.
1,Poor Quality Product,This item cannot be played on my computer. The sound is fuzzy. It is as though it was recorded from an AM radio.
5,Prince at his all time best!,I just listened to this CD and in my opinion it is one of Prince's best albums. Great jazz influence and traces of James Brown funk. Love every track on the CD. Highly recommend!

Prince is special and this album must;ve worried WB because they kne wit wa smade under duress, displeasure, yet it is good and at teh same time it's a swan song. So was this his best for them or just a cast off of a genius? LOLHe's a Gemini, it was that, both and more!Buy it---but at the used price, not a dime to WB for misunderstand that you can't buy or control a man once you have given him enough to be free."
3,Came,"Considering that his career was being hijacked thru this phase of his development, this release reflects that struggle. It comes across like a rebelling thirteen year old. While I completely support his vigilante ethics on sexual expression, the music itself on this CD just did nothing for me. Sad, that."
2,one of prince's worst albums!,"although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album ""musicology"" instead."
2,A hit-and-miss affair for true Prince fans only,"If you buy this album, buy it for ""Come,"" ""Dark,"" and ""Letitgo."""
2,So-so album...,"Next to Graffiti Bridge, this is my second least favorite Prince album.Still an ok album though. Very dark sounding, with a little techno feel to a couple of the songs. Highlights for me are the title track, and suprisingly Papa. The rest I can take or leave it.B-"
5,COME - an invitation to listen,"I first heard this CD when it was released in 1994. Perhaps you just have to be in the right place to connect with the music here. Actually, I find that to be true of all music especially music by Prince. Some people have been very critical of this CD as a collection from the vault. Personally, I am ok with that, it doesn't matter when a song was written as long as it means something to you when you hear it. Many of the songs are dark and may seem depressing. Some songs seem excessively long, but then any true Prince fan is familar with his jams and how long they can last. I give it 5 stars because I connected with the songs, it was also a dark time in my life and oddly this cd helped me feel better."
3,"Not enough for me, and not helpful for non-Jews","I've been trying for several years to land on a Haggadah that I like. I grew up using the Union Haggadah (Reform), but that doesn't do it for me anymore. I want something a little more than that, but not a 2-hour Seder. Plus, I want some updating in the liturgy. I'd heard from from friends who grew up with the Maxwell House Haggadah that this was the ticket, but it wasn't for me. We usually have a few non-Jews at our Seder, and though this is a dialed-back service, the book itself is sort of hard to use, in my opinion. I swear I'm going to create my own this year, so that the progression of the service is obvious, all of the major elements are covered and well-explained, and the liturgy is updated/more modern."
3,What happened? (no spoilers),"I must confess I wasn't sure if I was reading part of the much Beloved (pun intended) vampire series or not. It almost seemed as though the author got quite some distance into the novel, remembered she was supposed to be writing for the series, then had to figure a quick way into squishing this book in. While it was mostly entertaining, I had problems with a highly intelligent heroine who seemed to be unable to understand (unwilling?) some fairly simple concepts and the ""deus ex machina"" ending to it all.I was just a little disappointed. It would have been a far better stand alone novel and possibly even the beginning of a new series. Of course, it won't stop me from watching madly for the next in the series."
2,not worth it,"This is not one of Katie's better works. The title is misleading. I found the story to be dull, and slow. Stick with the Aisling Grey stories instead."
2,The Last of the Red Hot Vampires,"Katie MacAlister has often had me laughing out loud and really enjoying her storylines and her characters; however, she has missed the mark with this book. The main character, Portia is not likeable. In fact, if I were her friend I would have told her to find someone else to vacation with instead of making my vacation a pedant rave fest. I find that if I can't enjoy the main character within the first few pages of the book, I have a very hard time continuing reading the book. I got as far as page 75 and still couldn't find a reason anyone would like this woman. My feeling is that this is what my highschool teacher labeled as a ""potboiler"" which the author churned out in order to make a deadline while working on a better book. Take out all of the stupid denial and you probably will find a short story which could have been better served by its inclusion in an anthology."
1,Thank god it's the last,"This book is a complete waste of time. Portia is boring and annoying and her best friend is even worse. Theo seems completly unconcerned about his change and seems to be more concerned with sleeping with Portia. Don't waste your money on this book. You will be unhappy and annoyed. Once again the breezy, chick lit type heorine has destroyed another book."
4,liked it,love the dark ones and there Beloveds i think there will be a lot more to come but i would love more tie ins with the others
1,A Disappointment all Around,"I absolutely love the Dark Ones series. My favorite thing about them? The plucky, loveable heroines of course. ""The Last of the Red Hot Vampires"" fell short in that area. While most of Katie MacAlister's female characters start out as skeptics, none are as obnoxious about it as Portia. Even when she has a rain cloud following her around, she still refuses to believe and insults everyone around her who does. I found it incredibly hard to finish this novel because of her character. I am so glad this wasn't the ""Last"" of the Dark Ones. Pia, in ""Zen and the Art of Vampires"", has my vote any day."
2,Not one of her best,"Sorry Katie - this wasn't one of your stronger efforts. I'm a big fan of the Ashling books. They're lots of fun, quick reads and the characters are pretty well developed and likable. It's not that the characters in this book weren't likable, just not that interesting. The story was weak compared to the others by this author. I'm afraid I wouldn't recommend it. There are better options out there for the time invested."
4,twisted plot needs following but good,"while i really enjoy these vampire books for their comedy, this one adds a little dimension with the deepening plot. At times it feels contrived, but for the most part can be followed and enjoyed"
3,Bollywood EMMA,"I really enjoyed this Indian version of Jane Austen's novel ""Emma"". I have also seen the Bollywood ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"", so I am somewhat familiar withthe conventions of the cinema - music and dance interwoven into the story line and nokissing between men and women. I love the energy of the movie.This classic English novel transferred well, as did the other two. Part of the universality of Austen 's artistryand the talent of Indian film makers."
2,One song,I purchased this for one song.(When I Come Back (I Wanna Be My Dog))Don't care for rest of material.
5,Excited,I am excited to start reading this book. It was as described and in great condition for a great price. Thank you.
4,Solid Purchase,"I have just begun using this router but so far am very pleased. I had originally considered purchasing a Triton router because of the strong reviews. However, I am now glad I purchased the Hitachi because the size is much more manageable. The router appears to have more than enough power to handle all of the basic routing needs that I have and the low noise level is a welcome relief from the high decibel scream of my old Craftsman router. The plunge router action is a little rough and jerky...and correcting this flaw would certainly improve the overall performance. The only other negative comment is that it is a bit awkward to have to remove the motor from the bases in order to change the bit, which still uses the old two wrench system. In general, however, I am very pleased and would definitely recommend this product. The cost/product ratio is excellent."
4,Great router!,I've had my router for over half a year and I'm very happy with it. The variable speed is very helpful and can cut down the noise if I don't need top speed. It is kinda noisy at top speed but pretty quite at half. The plunge base is very easy to use as well as the fixed base. This tool will get alot of use.The only complaint I have is the amount of aftermarket products available to fit this router. Everything seems to be made for PC! Lots of times I had to drill my own holes in so-called universal products so it will fit my router. This is the only reason I give it 4 stars.
3,"Yep, spend more, get the Bosch","This is a good router. But the Bosch 1617 is better. Some of the fit and finish is cheap, and it is made in China and it shows. Overall, solid Hitachi design, but the Bosch is a simply better design. You won't go wrong with this, but there is better. There seems to be a lot of grease in the collet that is not needed.Ergonomics are good. The mechanics are a little cumbersome. You can do better."
4,Returning to wood working,"Its been awhile, I like the soft start and quiet. Tools are getting better. Worked great in a jig I made. I put four stars for I don't know what a five should be.Dan"
3,"whith accessories,it should be perfect","nice and quite operation, but I didn't managed to buy the related accessories."
5,great tool to have around,I bought this for occasional use and it has worked great. Its nice to have the fixed base as well as the plunger option if i need it and the variable speed has helped give a nice edge without burning the wood based on how fast I route with it. It seems to be built well enough that it would work great for the professional craftsman as well.
1,Trash,Almost burned my house down. Melted and burned me. I only ran a 40w light with it. Be safe. Chinese quality!
3,good but after a while connection become loose,"i used and everything went well, but after some use the connection started to be loose (it unplugs by itself if you just touching the electrical plug)"
1,it doesn't convert!,My European electronic machine works faster without this converter than with it ... I was considering returning but it is cheap and time is precious as well.
1,Worked for one day,"Bought the item off Amazon, it was delivered in a couple of days.Tried using it in the US (110v to 220v) on a coffee maker and it didn't work. Tried it with some other stuff and it seemed to work OK. The next day it simply stopped working altogether.If you have 220v devices and you want to use them in the US, don't buy this product.This is the second ""cheap"" converter I have bought that has stopped working after a couple of days, I bought the other one in Europe. I also have a Goldsource heavy duty transformer that cost about $100 and that has been working continuously for 3 months without any problems.It look as though you get what you pay for with this type of product."
1,Overheating and smelling like burning plastic,"Plugged a low power portable DVD player into this and after about 30 minutes, I could barely even touch the adapter and it had a strong smell of plastic burning - this is a fire risk if I had left it any longer................these are simply not suitable, even for something which is around 25W power useHave now removed it and will not use it again - as far as I am concerned, these are not suitable for use"
2,charger didn't work,"This charger is suppose to be a voltage converter when I travel internationally, but smoked and stopped working when I plugged it in"
2,Worked good before I tried to use 25W Hair Ceramic Iron,"We bought 2 these converters and they worked really good... before yesterday. I made a new haircut and wanted to make my hair straight so got european 25W hair ceramic iron inserted in the converter. Not only the iron didn't get as hot as it should, but also the smoke keep going from the converter!!! I was very upset about this and next time will buy something more powerful."
1,Dangerous!!!!!!,"I use it to power the Panasonic SQT-825, which is a 27W table lamp.I discovered some burning smells lately, so I found this guy.....The plastic cover has already melted...Took the temperature reading from a Fluke IR thermometer, guess what's the reading?????217 F &#65288;103 C&#65289; and, it was stilling raising !!!!!!!!For the sake of your own safety, please please please stopping using it, or DON'T buy it....PS: I also have taken pictures for proof, but i can't upload it because the Amazon only support video...."
5,nice little converter,This is a nice little converter and does what its supposed to do. Quality is pretty good and I think it will last if you dont overload or overuse it.
1,"Arrived 6 hours ago, already melted after 1 hour of usage","I ordered this for a 50W halogen desk lamp I brought while moving from Europe. It is quite a challenge to change the transformer to a 110V one so I picked a 110V-220V converter instead. It literally arrived about 6 hours ago, I happily plugged it in turned on the light and went away for about 1 hour to do some other work. When I came back, the room was full of burned plastic smell. Not difficult to guess, it was this converter. It was so hot to even touch it. It melted onto my extension cord. I am glad I caught on time, otherwise this could have resulted in a fire."
1,It blew up,"As soon as we used it in India, it blew up. We were not even putting excessive load on it. This thing is heavy and worthless. I should have carried rocks in my bag rather than this. Can I get my money back? I strongly recommend Amazon to take it off."
3,"Some good songs, but not as good as his debut","The catchy calypso opener, ""Change Has Gotta Come,"" is a very good song. I also like ""That's the Beauty of It,"" ""Time,"" and ""Hero."" But on the whole, this album is a departure from the Stones style rock that Mullen mastered on the first album (Revival) and the Springsteen style rock of the second album, Faded Blues. By the way, Revival is one of the best contemporary Christian rock debuts of all time, filled with passionate R&B and acoustic blues roots rock numbers. And this self titled album just doesn't stand up to the earlier work. But I commend Mullen for trying to expand his musical reach. Having said that, try to find his debut album, Revival. You won't regret it."
2,Where are the Desktop Publishing Instructions?,"This must be the book I bought and returned because, although its title suggested otherwise, it dealt exclusively with the internet. I like ""Dummies"" books and wanted one on PageMaker desktop publishing, not on webpages. I understand from reading another customer's comments that there is not one on straight desktop publishing. I wish the authors had been more straightforward about what their book contained...it would have saved me a lot of time and trips to the bookstore. Guess I will have to look elsewhere for my Pagemaker instructions."
3,Where's the desk-top publishing?????,"This book would have been very good if I had wanted to publish a web page. Unfortunenately, I'm using PageMaker for it's intended purpose, desktop publishing. PageMaker 6.5 for Dummies never addressed how to use the program for print publishing. I was very disappointed."
4,Neat product; fun and easy to use!,I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter to have fun with her hair. She loves for me to dress her up with jewels in her hair. The product is very easy to use and I have had no difficulty getting the gems to stay in her hair or removing them at the end of the day.
2,Waste of money,"It either pulls your hair into it, or if you have thin hair it wont stay on at all. Then you find the gems on the floor (because they fall out) after you've stepped on it!OUCH!"
1,Ugh1,I love the idea of this it is so cute and such a great way to spice up my daughters hair routine- but it fell apart the first day and despite being a conair product it really is poorly made and not worth the money
2,Not well made,"The concept is great, however the jewels will not stay on my daughter's hair. She resorted to putting them on the doll and the pieces fall off after playing with it for a while."
4,Good fun for girls,My daughter loves to use this. Once you get the hang of it it's fun to use and decorate your hair with. She was 8yrs when we got it and able to do it by herself. We did order extra gems.
4,extremely fun and easy to use,"i got this item for my 5 year old, because everytime she saw the commercial she would sing to it and said she wanted it. when we got it and tried it on her hair i was impressed with how well it works. but i wouldn't suggest this item for such a young consumer lol, she pulled them all out within minutes. it would be really cool though for preteens!"
5,It's a gem,This is a great product. It's fun and very easy to use. The gems come out very easily and can be reused. My daughter loves this and so do I.
4,Quick Gems,"I bought this for my 8 year old as a Christmas gift. She loves it. It seems easy to use, the gems stay in her hair, and they come out with little fuss."
1,hate!,"this product does not deserve the one star. it deserves no stars. piece of junk!!! it annoys me to pay shipping to even return this. worth nothing, does not work, cheap piece of plastic, opened package all the beads fell on the floor, what a hoax. stay away from this toy worth 1 penny."
3,A Piece of junk but...,"I was dead set against buying this but it was a request by my daughter for Christmas. The beads attach to one single strand of your hair despite the instructions telling you to take about 1/4"" of hair. They basically have a spring mechanism in the middle of the gems that you pull apart to remove from the hair."
3,Ok Product,Product was a must have Gift from Santa. My daughter loves it but for the price it was a splurge. Had it not been for Christmas I would not have paid that amount.
1,Didn't use,My granddaughter just HAD to have this product.. She is 7... She didn't use it at all... She has long hair...
2,Is the surface made of glue?,"I got this pad hoping it would give me an easy gliding surface for my mouse. I own several mice between the 3 computers at the house and a couple at my office. Regardless of which mouse I use, the surface of this pad requires an additional push to get things moving. Then you overshoot your target (Icon, text, hyperlink...you name it).The designers may in fact be genius. At $10 it's not worth a return trip to the store to get your money back and they probably make them for a buck. Sound business plan. I wish I had purchased a 10 dollar pet rock. At least I could find a use for it, like holding down papers.This is not a gaming mousepad, it is barely a mousepad. Get the neoprene pad and save yourself the misery of seeing this thing and knowing you were had."
3,Basically a plastic sheet with some sticky glue on the back,"This is a plastic sheet that is sticky on the back. The stickness wears out pretty quick and you then have a sliding plastic sheet under you mouse. If you continue to use it the backing will peel off, and there will be holes in the grey backing. Then you'll toss it in the trash and wonder why you bought the thing."
5,WOW Mouse Pad,"Works great, stays where put and mouse slides on it really nice. It's big enough that I put a part of it under the keyboard (might be part of the reason it stays put)and still plenty of room for gaming."
2,Large Attractive and Loud,"Never thought I would call a mouse pad loud, but with a current apple wireless magic mouse the pad is loud. The plastic strips on the bottom of the mouse rub against the plastic texture of the Wow!Pad and, for me, are too loud. On the plus side, my old worn out 3M Precision Mousing Surface sticks well to the large surface of the Wow!Pad and is functional again. It is also much quieter.There you have it... a loud mouse pad."
5,Graph Pad - Large,"Excellent Product Quality.This item is a must for any gamer or desktop computer user to save wear on the desktop surface, mouse, wrist and hand.Anti-skid pad is useful until dust eventually creeps onto the surface, blue painters tape saves the day in making this a slip/skid proof surface for your optical mouse."
2,"Precise, but doesn't last long and backing not sticky enough","- I've used a Microsoft Sidewinder Mouse (Optical) with it.- This mouse pad has endured about 2 hours of use a day over 5 months.The precision of this mouse pad is fantastic.But, the backing made essentially of very tiny indents in the plastic does not stick very well to the surface of a desk, so mouse movements can often move the pad around. Not all the time, but enough that it can become annoying.Further, as a result of friction over time, the textured surface has smoothed out to the point that parts of the pad have become reflective. The reflective surface causes optical mice to be imprecise, making the mouse pad useless after less than 6 months of use.Overall, I'm disappointed. I just purchased a ""Fellowes Microban"" mouse pad for 5$ and I'm much happier with it."
2,"Big, but akward...","This mouse pad is BIG (which was what I was looking for), but it's made of a thin, hard plastic. It's really awkward to use w/ an optical mouse. I don't get the feel I was looking for from a regular mouse pad (soft, plush-like). It's like using one of those PC gaming mouse pads. I don't like it."
1,Bad Traction for mouse on overpriced pad,"The ad for this pad seemed so wonderful, I could not resist. Upon receipt I find this pad to be really overpriced and over-hyped. It is less good than older pads costing much less. Do not be drawn into the hype for this pad."
2,Spray Glue?,"The mouse pad works great, but it doesn't stay in one place. Another thing is that it is smaller than a normal mouse pad. If that's what you are looking for then this is the one. The moving around killed it for me."
1,Allsop Mouse Pad Curls Up,I bought the Allsop mouse pad at the recommendation of a guy at Office Depot. Took it to the office and loved it. Went back and got one for home ... loved it there too. But ... after four months they both started to curl or bow up and would not stay put on the desk. Have send three emails to Allsop customer service with no replies. I like the way the pad works so well with the mice that I am thinking of getting some spray adhesive and permanently glueing it to my desk.It appears that Allsop Customer Service does not exist or does not care.
1,Not good for mechanical mice,"Despite the claims of ""For Use With Optical or Standard Mouse Pads"", it's too slippery for my ball mouse to grip, which sort of misses the point of a mouse pad. It may work for optical mice, but those aren't supposed to need a pad.I'm still a little vague as to why I'd want to use a mouse pad with my mouse pad, but I'll chalk that up to the usual lack of proofreading in Amazon product descriptions."
4,HUGE,"this thing is huge! seems a bit cheaply made very thin as well but overall mouse performance is amazing, using a razer mouse and a Microsoft blue light one and they both work great. also it does slip quite a bit after the stickiness on the bottom fades due to dust."
4,Great but wore out fast. ---Update to original review,"When I first got this pad I was thrilled with the size and how well my wireless mouse worked on it. I purchased it in May 2010 and here it is August 21st and it is no longer tracking, which as far as I can tell is because it has worn smooth. I am going to buy another one because I do like the convenience of the design but I do wish it would last longer.REVIEW UPDATE - Nov. 2, 2010As stated above, I did buy another one of these mouse pads in August. I started having trouble again with the mouse not tracking. My brother was here with his laptop and had me try his Logitech wireless mouse and it worked fine on this mousepad. I am now thinking the problem was with my Microsoft wireless mouse and not the mousepad after all. I bought a couple of the Logitech wireless mice (or is it mouses in this instance?) because they were inexpensive and I wanted a spare. The Logitech mouse works great!"
5,Amazing mouse pad!,I am ordering a second one for home. I have used one at work for 6 months. It is very thin and my mouse floats on it.
5,Best. Mousepad. EVER,"Light, thin, large and wonderful. I have had my wowpad on my office desk at work for about 8 or 9 months now. When I used another computer recently I realized just how much I loved my wowpad. The grid and texture make for great tracking. The slightly tack back keeps the pad in place. I use an Allsop ""Wrist Assist"" wrist rest in conjunction with my pad and it works out great."
4,Good pad but slips,"The pad has a good surface that makes the mouse pointer go faster than other surfaces. I had to reduce the pointer speed to get it how I like it with this pad.I think that the size is a bit large and I'm using dual monitors. I can move the pointer on both screens fully without using most of the pad.This pad slips from it's position very often. It doesn't matter if you wash the bottom or not. Like many others say, it slips a lot. I tried taping it to my desk and eventually it still slips out of place.I don't think that it's the biggest problem and I'll try some stronger tape in the future. Otherwise, it's good."
2,Hoping for more.,"Having upgraded from a 3m optical mouse surface, I was hoping the larger area would be a great improvement. I was not happy to find out that moving the mouse at certain speeds and certain angles would cause it to jump to the edge of the screen. Perhaps I was spoiled from the 3m surfaces, but I could not play games requiring Line of Sight scopes having it bounce. Had to return it."
1,Do not waste your money unless you want to spend more,"This is a disappointment. The sticky stuff on the back lasts about a day or two. I did clean the glass desktop before using, but that did not make a difference. I suppose you can go and purchase spray on sticky glue, but the product should work that way."
2,skipping pointer on computer,"I purchased this mouse pad about a year ago for the large size. A few months ago, I noticed very erratic movement of the cursor when using the mouse. After changing mice, keyboards, and usb cables, I found that the surface of the WOW mouse pad had become ""polished"" and reflective and it caused my optical mouse to skip and behave erratically. Changed back to an old mouse pad with no further problems - would not recommend."
2,Difficult to use,If you are looking for a mouse pad with very smooth plastic surface this pad is for you. However I found this smoothness detrimental. It is so smooth that when clicking the mouse it will cause cursor to jump. You have to click the mouse button repeatedly to elicit any action. After a while this gets very frustrating.
3,"Not bad, could have been better","I bought this at the same time that I bought a Steelseries QcK pad and I have to say this pad lacks in the comparison.It is huge and seems to track well, but it does have a tendency to slide on the glass desk top. Compared to the Steelseries this just doesn't cut it.Not bad, but not great either."
5,Mouse Pad,"Pad is fantastic,use it for games and every day processing.I switch (Mice.pl.) and do not have any control problems betwene switches."
5,Amazingly Great Pad!,"I recently purchased this pad and I must say it shocked me. First of all it's pretty big which is a major plus on it's side and my mouse glides effortlessly, sometimes it feels like it's gliding on air. The pad is so amazingly thin you can tuck the edges under things without any problems and the non slip bottom keeps it in place at all times, even under heavy gaming."
1,Horrible optical tracking,"I can't understand the positive reviews for this product. We purchased ~6 of these pads for workstations around my lab. With every single pad, the cursor randomly jumps to the edge of the screen. This does not happen when we switch back to normal mouse pads. Also, the pads do not stay in place -- they slide around all over the desk. When new, the pad backing is slightly tacky to grip the desk, but the grip quickly wears off. The only good things about these pads are (1) they wipe clean, and (2) the large mousing surface. Very disappointing."
2,Not worth the price IMO,"Ok yes it's big, yes it functions, BUT for the money you'd think it would at least stay in one place. I was expecting a Mouse pad with the soft foam backing but this is essentially a large piece of firm, thin plastic... and it slides all over the place. I taped mine down."
5,.5 millimeters or 0.0196850394 inches thick,"Geez it would have been nice to know exactly how thick this pad is before buying it. Can anyone ar Amazon.com create factual product descriptions? The pad is .5 millimeters or 0.0196850394 inchesAnyway, it's a great pad, I really liked it, so I used some 3m spray adhesive to make it stick to the desk :-)3M 90-24 Spray Adhesive 17.6-OunceI hope that helps someone."
2,nope,"they say this thing sticks to your desk but i guess no one has ever used it on a wooden desktop. still slides around like crazy. also, understand this is not like a typical mousepad. it's not thick and cushy. it's basically a thin sheet of hard plastic. might as well just call it a desk protector, not a mousepad."
2,"Surface is ok, backing is poor",The pad is large and the response with the laser mouse seems ok (at least better than my desk but nowhere as good as a Razer mouse pad I had tried previously). The back of this pad is slick as well so it has a tendency to slide around.
5,Budapest Map,"Love these plastic maps. Ever been stuck in the rain with a paper map trying to figure out where the heck you are and the map disintegrates? Well, I have and it sucks. I intend to put this map to good use very soon! Arrived fast, excellent condition."
2,Budapest map,"The map is nice but does not cover the entire city. If you are serious about traveling in Hungary, you probably need to go to Europe to get a good enough map. This isn't it. I wrote them asking if they had a better map and they didn't even answer."
2,Good but...,"It's a good map but considering that most people will take public transport and see the well marked general tourist atractions, you don't really need it. It gets two stars as it's a good map but not really required for a trip to Budapest."
5,Budapest,"This map was a travel necessity. What a lifesaver, Budapest was a challange but Streetwise was very easy to use and helped us to get around. very durable!"
2,Can't track a trip on one page.,"The problem with this map is that in trying to be so small it limits its usefulness. You can't track a whole trip on one page, or easily find a street by name. I should have learned my lesson about these Streetwise maps by now."
5,Good city map,"This map is small enough to open while sitting on a bench, and it contains all the information you need to navigate the city."
2,Had to rely on other maps,"It didn't have tram lines or stops. Also missed the fact that one station name has apparently been changed. Like another reviewer said, you have to keep folding it over to the other side when you're making a trip. It's laid out wrong I believe. I ended up relying on other maps. Ones for other cities on our trip were far more useful."
5,Music for thirsty brains,"The other reviewer wrote:""If you're into dark, brainy, arty, euro-progressive-instrumental sorts of things, you'll love this.""He was right on the money. I have a difficult time describing this music, because it's not quite classical and it's not really rock. It's sort of a new genre. I would definitely recommend Art Zoyd (and Univers Zero) to people who are searching for something new and different, something that lies outside of the usual categories.I would recommend this album to fans of Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Terry Riley, Gavin Bryars, Nick Cave, Tom Waits, David Lynch, Lars Von Trier, Meredith Monk, King Crimson, etc etc.The mood tends to be pensive, the atmosphere dark, the key minor. It's cinematic and moody, but never dull or boring. This music is filled with passion and musical inventiveness."
3,Personal Politics Gets Personal,"I chose this book to read for my book report in history class. I had never read any of Sara Evans' other works, but it seemed interesting from reading the jacket. Once I started reading, it pulled me in. I think that because Sara used so many personal stories it really drew me in. I would not consider myself a feminist, but after reading this book, it opened my eyes to a lot of things I was unaware of. So, I definitely recommend this book to everyone."
2,Hopefully Helpful,"The title indicates that this book is about womens civil rights. This is what I considered part of the thesis of the book as well. However, as I read this book it seemed to me that very little of the book concentrated on the struggles women made during the Civil Right Movement of the 1960's. The book focused mostly on the race issue of the movement only sporadically mentioning the struggles women faced. I feel that she could have asserted her personal experiences in a more profound manner by keeping foucus on her thesis ""The Roots of Women's Liberation in the Civil Rights Movement & the New Left"". This book is a valuable read from the historic perspective, but I do not consider it to be an easy read fucused on its main subject matter. In other words, if you don't have to read it or the Civil Rights Movement as a whole is not in your main interest, perhaps you should look for another book."
2,"it's not 20,000%, more like 1,700% or 327% p/a, but an ok read","The authors invested an initial $346,000 and after 5 years write they have combined net worths of $6,000,000. Very impressive but by no means 20,000% return. They did an impressive job of initially acquiring and upgrading small residential properties and the book is a nice short read about that. But they built their business by buying properties yielding 30-50-60% cash-on-cash returns, something I doubt can be done, or duplicated, now after this past five-year real estate explosion. Even they admit yields are now more like 7-9%."
3,"Great content, poor printing","I received my copy of the new (2001) printing of NATURE'S CHAOS earlier today. While the Porter photographs are both unusual and beautiful, it's great pity that this edition is poorly printed. I've not seen the original edition for comparison. In this printing, color is poorly balanced for many photographs, often to the point that the original vision is obscured. Plus, some photos are very ""soft"" and lacking in detail, which is surely the fault of the printers as well. What a shame, and what a surprise coming from Little, Brown."
2,"Wonderful potential, poor execution","The paperback copy of Nature's Chaos that I received a few days ago is a severe disappointment. The fault lies entirely with the quality of the reproductions of some of Porter's finest work. Overall contrast is poor while the colour contrast blocks many details. The colours are generally off and in some cases there are errors of registration.The original edition may have been better and the text is a revelation. But if this book interests you, spring the extra expense for some decent printing."
1,Horrible strollers!,I purchased this stroller under the BeBe Love name and it is terrible. The wheels are all over the place the latch broke the first time we folded it...do not buy this stroller pay the extra now and buy a better travel stroller.
3,Carlton review,"Made for indoor play. Birdies, racquets, poles for net are of avg. quality. They are lightweight and allow for fast play. The net, which was the primary reason for buying the set was extremely cheap. It is only about 1 foot high and made of weak materials. A tear in the net occurred the first time I set it up. I would recommend the seller add the dimensions of the net and quality of materials used so people know what they are buying."
3,They're alright,"Installed these in my '97 Jeep Cherokee. I just wanted a cheap but good set of speakers for my weekend offroader. I used to use Jensen speakers all the time way back when I was a poor high schooler and they were impressive back then. Either my standards have improved or their quality is slipping, because these speakers are simply adequate. Nothing more. The crossovers are nice, the tweeters are decent, and the woofers are weaksauce."
1,Poor photographical material,"""Don't judge the book by the cover"". No, that would be a serious mistake since the cover photo is as crisp and clear as you could ever wish for. The same doesn't apply to the photos inside alas. A third of them are almost good, a third are of poor quality and the rest are disasterous. Hazy, unclear, no focus. Many taken in strong sunlight with pitch-black shadows and colors like fifties postcards from East Germany. And a book like this, with rather a small amount of text and a great deal of pictures, you buy for the pictures. Not a good idea.The choice of gardens are (mainly) not the most celebrated and featured classical gardens, but lesser known ones and from all centuries. This is a good idea that makes this book a complement to such like Edith Whartons Italian Gardens, which I rate very highly."
5,Great Comeback,"This is indeed a wonderful live recording. I personally feel that the Jewel was Pendragon's best CD, including the line-up. To see the tracks performed on DVD is as good as seeing the band on stage. Nick Barret hasn't lost his voice and blends well with the music. It was great to see Rick Carter back on keyboards. This is a definite must for Pendragon fans and progressive rock fans alike. Buy this if you are into Genesis and Camel. You won't be disappointed"
4,MMM-MMM Meat Pies!,"Sweeney Todd (Tod Slaughter) and his accomplice Mrs. Lovatt have a strange business relationship. Todd brings the rich victims into his barbershop, where he throws the secret switch to his trick barber-chair, sending them into the basement for a throat-cutting and fleecing. Mrs. Lovatt then makes mince-meat out of the poor saps in her shop next door. Sort of an ancient forerunner to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, SWEENEY TODD is a perfectly gruesome little story. I especially like the new apprentice, Tobias, who goes next door for those tasty meat pies whenever his new master gets a new victim for his razor. Tobias is the eighth boy in eight weeks to fill the job. The other seven have all gone missing! It's a crime that this film has not gotten the notice it deserves. It's creepy, ghoulish, and humorous. Tod Slaughter is menacing, and no more silly in this than Bela is in DEVIL BAT for heaven's sake! Sheesh! Well worth owning..."
1,Not the Musical,"To anyone thinking that this 'Sweeney Todd' will be anything like the musical, please think again - it's not, and couldn't be if it tried."
4,"Even if you do not play Magic, you can still enjoy this one.","Even if you do not play the Magic card game, you can still enjoy this novel. Ashes of the Sun is the story of Ayesh, a former wrestler who is the last of her great civilization. In Ayesh's world, storytelling is an art, and tales can be traded for food or other goods. Ayesh wants her people to be remembered, and so she travels the land, telling her tale. To her frustration she finds that stories often change each time they are told, and the great cities of Neah that were her home will not be remembered as they were. Ready to die, and with nothing left to live for, she is captured by Minotaurs! Forced into the middle of intricate Minotaur politics, she sees and does things she never thought possible. In the midst of her unusual captivity, she discovers she does want to live after all. Braddock creates a new world full of surprise and intrigue. This book was a page turner, and I was up all night finishing it."
5,Once you pick up this book kiss the rest of the day good-bye,"I might be just a little biased playing the card game, but this has to be one of my favorite ""fantasy"" reads. It has a great deal of in-depth charector struggle that just makes you constantly fliping the pages to see whats up next. If you are a fan of the game this is a must buy and if you like the fantasy styled books this is one you will not be able to put down!"
5,This album just doesn't let you go.,"With infectious beats and catchy, borderline-meaningless lyrics, Tiger Bay is an album that just carries me away with its incredible sound. From the aptly-named 'Urban Clearway' (it really does fit with the image of driving a sports car through the city - what a cool song!), to the sublime 'Like A Motorway' that I couldn't get out of my head for six straight hours, there isn't a song that I don't like on this album. I do miss the little 'sample' songs that were on Foxbase Alpha and So Tough. I always thought they were cute (and funny). But they really wouldn't fit here in this electronic sound they've created. Sarah Cracknell's voice is wonderful, and the music is great. Long live Saint Etienne."
3,"wildly erratic, as usual","If you're in the mood for some fey pop, Tiger Bay is an enjoyable diversion. I played it a lot when I first got it because it sounded so contemporary, but after several listens the fragmentary nature of the songs became frustrating and tedious. Saint Etienne have always seemed to merely nibble at the idea of a fully-fledged pop song, so most of their work sounds unfinished or half-realised. When they actually hit upon a chorus they rarely manage to flesh it out with a correspondingly strong verse and bridge. Their music can often be catchy, but their samples and ironic quotes usually don't add up to much."
3,No Title,"First of all, this game should have had a longer storyline. Maybe I would have enjoyed it better. Second of all, if you dont like 50 cent, just dont even bother to buy it. Its all about him and how he got shot a while back, that is it. Third, we need more action fiddy!!! Put some umph into your game and make it like the ""True Crime"" series and try to extend the map a little bit more, hey we want to be able to see NYC am I right? Overall, its an ok game, I guess..."
1,Mindless shooter and over all horrible,"If you're into games with gameplay much like Truecrime: Streets of LA, you might. And I do mean, MIGHT. Like this game. But nearly everywhere you turn in this thing it's him plugging his vitamin water or music or just trying to show that he is some type of god because he can rap. This whole game is just cashing even more in on his fame. Totally lame. It's like just showing off everything and anything he can in this game. Eminem was hilarious in the game though. He won this game an extra star in the fun rating in this review.If you want a better game that is cheap and somewhat the same concept. Get Truecrime: Streets of LA and put in the Snoopdogg cheat. Then you can play a rapper with no annoying ads about him floating around and actually drive around a fully made map too.Oh yes, and thank god I rented it rather then buying."
1,There is a reason the price droped from 49.99 to 29.99,"This game is horrible. Heed this warning so you do not waste your money like I did. I do not usualy write reviews for a game that I didnt like, but I feel it is my obligation to save others out there from this garbage. ""50 cent"" is way too cool, I cant handle it. By the way; 50 cent is not bullet proof, hes just lucky."
3,good music.....,"i got this game for christmas. when i first started playing this game i thought it was okay. then i got further into it and all u do is go from your house to the subway and ride the subway to your mission, then u take the subway back and you go home and do it again. so, i was tired of doin this and decided to walk around '50s hood' which is very small and has invisble boundaries. i like gran theft auto games and the idea that u can walk wherever the hell u want, and let me say, u can barely walk anywhere in 50's hood. so i suggest u rent it before u buy it and see for yourself, i will most probably end up beating it in about an hour then put it on my shelf with the rest of the games i dont play anymore"
3,Did not work,"The game disc did not work on my playstation 2,it showed the companies and then it just froze, i am not saying the game was not good,just that the disc was sold while not working."
2,Pass On This One,"Naaaa, I wouldn't recommend this one, everyone back in the day was suckered into this game in late 2005, mainly for the fact that it was a rapper with his own video game, which is even unheard of for today's standard. The aiming system was irate, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo used to act real hardheaded, and the camera angles weren't that good either. In my opinion, this game wasn't good, especially when you get to the junkyard stage. But for mid-2000s nostalgia factors, you could get this I guess, even though I would recommend Grand Theft Auto."
1,from a females perspective,I bought this game for my boyfriend and from my experience with it its cool but the automatic aim aka the shooting is horrible its hard to know what ur shooting at also the fixed camera messes you up all the time in order to be able to manage the game you would have to turn it off in order to allow the characters to look at what u place them to rather than the system also the tasks are too simple for example one of the task would be kill a kidnapper and the next would be take elevator...take elevator?! the game is decent but not worth as much money as i paid on the good side the killing scenes are good but everything else is sketchy.
2,ugh...,"besides the graphics, this game sucks...almost as bad as Paris Hilton does. wow, u and the rest of the g-g-g-g-gay unit run around various 'hoods shooting and stabbing people. It is xtremely difficult and you quickly will lose interest or grow frustrated with this g-g-g-game.And his ego is so huge, it's unreal. His CDs, despite being garbage, going platinum, his ""gangsta"" clothing line, his ""hardcore gangsta"" movie... perhaps he forgot that he couldn't get discovered on his own...no he had to get big from Eminem... Now 50 thinks he is God's gift to rap music and to women. HA HA HAI can't wait till Nas or Jadakiss shoot this clown."
3,3 stars,"Its good game. its like shooting range.The control take alittle getting use to.The graphics are good , but sometimes lacking .Its gettings a 3 out of 5."
2,This feels more like a 50 cents publicity campaign than a game,"If you're a huge 50 cents fan and want to see your idol kicking everyone's butt, then get this. Otherwise, there are many better games in the same genre."
4,Why so much hatred for a great game?,"50 haters be gone! This game is great, it's like the hip hop version of Max Payne. It's got some awesome finishing moves, a great story, and I love the music on here. Sure this game is nothing special or new but it's still great fun. The only complaint I have is that you can't snipe with the Sniper Rifle. WTF is with that?"
2,50 misses his mark,"50 cent bulletproof could have been a good game if..THE GRAPHICS DIDNT SUCK,THE STORY LINE WASN'T WHACK AND IF IT WASNT TO DAMN SHORT!!The graphics get a 2/5sound/3/5 (for the soundtrack)fun factor 1/5overall 2/5Rent this only if you are a HUGE g-unit/50 cent fan"
2,WHY 50 WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I'm gonna cut right to the chase! THIS GAME SUCKS!!! The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because Dr.Dre is in the game(i'm a huge dr.dre fan) So people of America listen to me!DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!DON'T RENT THIS GAME!!!!!!AS A MATTER OF FACT DON'T EVEN PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,50 Cent iz in da howz!,"Yo homiez! Buy my new game! Im a roll modell for teh black comuniti cuz i got shot 9 timez! Buy my nu game so i can sell more recordz. Foget te fact tat tis game is a bad ripoff of GTA and look kewl wit Fitty Cent. Komplet wit bad aimin an pointless sotryline, along wit aperencis by (c)rappers lik Eminem n oters, tis is teh game for teh ages. Buy tis homiez, tis iz teh best game eva!!!!If you took any of that seriously, this game is for you."
1,should not have been put out,this game is really bad and guess what i am a huge 50 cent fan but i call it the way i see it some one said 50 should have had rockstar to help with game believe it or not he was suppose to be head person in san andras but 50 told them he wanted to make his own game well he droped the ball on this one
3,BULLETPROOF,THIS IS A GAME ONLY FOR THOSE NOT CONCERNED WITH QUALITY OR LOVE 50 BUT TO REAL GAMERS THIS IS ONLY WORTH RENTING IF THAT. STRAFING AND SHOOTING IS HARD MISSIONS ARE TOO SIMPLE MUSIC AND GRAPHICS ARE GREAT SO YOU DECIDE BUT I WOULD DECIDE AGINST IT I RENTED IT AND FINISHED IT IN 6 DAYS NOT A VERY HIGH REPLAY VALUE
2,50 misses his mark,"This could have been a good game if...THE GRAPHICS DIDNT SUCK,THE GAME WASNT TO DANG SHORT AND IF THE GAMEPLAY WAS SOMEWHAT DECENT.Graphics 2/5Sound 3/5 (because of the soundtrack)controls 2/5Fun factor 1/5Overall 2/5Only get this game if you are a HUGE 50 cent/g-unit fan"
5,Gretaest Game of a long time,"this game rocksa classic shooterneedlessto say, 50 has proven himself again"
3,And they say video games are immoral,"In this game you go around shooting policemen. It's a lot of fun. The only problem is because 50 is powered by his teeth, you have to keeping biting electrical wires, fences etc. Although this is fun at first, it gets annoying after a while."
2,Lasted five minutes,"The threads broke upon the first application to the lens - after that it would not remain attached and became useless. Affordability is about the only thing this product has going for it - in this case, you're better off spending the extra dollars for a quality hood."
2,Just OK,This lens hood is just OK. It screws on but is easily dislodged. It just pops off when bumped. Not for a serious photographer.
1,Junk,"The Omni Grip is an over-priced, flimsy piece of junk. Get the folding Gopher from Walgreens instead - it's much sturdier. The Omni Grip broke within two week's of light but regular usage."
3,Fine Writing Falls Flat at the End,"This book is many of the things it is alleged to be: violent, suspenseful, full of well drawn weird characters, and a description of rural West Virginia that makes it as menacing as any exotic setting. The plot keeps driving and driving, bringing a bare-knuckle fighter, gun runners, a psycho drug lord, enslaved illegal immigrants, and other assorted folk together for a grand shoot 'em out climax. Unfortunately it falls a bit flat in the end as things get a little too odd, I can't quite put my finger on it, but the end didn't satisfy me or justify the buildup. Others may be happier with the results."
4,Interesting but flawed,"An interesting first novel, particularly for its subject matter and characters. Benedict is at his finest when a) describing the lust West Virigina hill country that he seems familiar with. and b)creating violent imagery. On these merits alone, I recommend this book and would compare it to, oh, Elmore Leonard and Brett Easton Ellis. The plot of the book seems rather tangential to what Benedict is trying to achieve. The story, such as it is, seems to serve as an exscuse for Benedict to show off his talent and his choice of venue. Benedict, to me, seems similar to Bret Easton Ellis in that he enjoys portraying grotestque situations with a peculiar kind of flatness. Character's speak with strange inflections (by this I don't mean sterotyped hillbilly drawl) and motivation is not always evident. This book is a fascinating read, particularly for those of us who don't interact, on a regular basis, with crazed Hill Country drug lords. I'll be interested in his next book."
5,Keeps my closet neat,"This is a great little closet set for keeping a few non-hagging items together. I use this for my socks, underwear and a couple of random articles of clothing and it works great. I also have another set of the same brand that I store computer stuff in (in a different closet) and it works great for that too."
5,A good show whose life was,"Cut way too short. This was a fun show, too bad the idiots in charge killed it. I do not know what the reasons were but honestly I can do without 1 more show about fat obnoxious women getting married or another house show,. Etc... T.V. Just keeps getting worse. When they do get a good show it is like the people in charge just can not wait to kill it.I bought both seasons and have enjoyed them all over again, t.v. Is so bad I buy all the good stuff from Amazon and do not pay $100.00 per moth cable bills like some people I know. Best of all thanks to amazon the price is always good and I can watch what I want when I want commercial free, nothing I like better than a new liner commercial coming on at 80 db with stay fresh wings announcing freedom for sale when you buy their product. NOT!!!!Take control of your viewing and buy the series you like on DVD'S from Amazon ah now that's freedom!"
4,Really enjoyed this series,"I received this very promptly and really enjoyed it. Of course, I hate that it was cancelled and seemed to end kind of abruptly because of it...it did end on a very hopeful note, though.Always very quick-witted and darkly funny, you could tell that Kevin Smith was involved in the creative direction but it (thankfully) lacked the extreme crudeness one finds in a lot of his other works, probably due to the fact that it was on the CW network. And Ray Wise as the Devil is a stroke of casting genius."
5,Most Excellent,Really enjoy the Reaper series can't wait for season 3would like to have know how many episodes were in the series but not really tht big of a deal. Overall was very pleased with the porduct quality and delivery time.
4,Great show!,"Reaper was a great show and should have been renewed for a full 22 episodes. It was a mistake cancelling the show. All the characters, especially the Devil, are hilarious. Season 2 was actually better than season one. I can't believe that Reaper was cancelled and people are still watching American Idol and America's Next Top Model. They only offer more of the same each season, only with different people. My only problem with Reaper is that there was not enough fight scenes."
5,"from a 'new' vegetarian as recently as 2 years ago, I can","truthfully say, this is MUST read material. Though my 'reformed' thought was due to my love for animals; reading this book, made me realize the deeper importance of our dwindling resouces. It's a true 'wake up' call for humanity. I invite my brothers and sisters to ""think"" about every 'throw away' item we waste. READ the book!"
5,This book has altered the direction of my life.,"After having read Mr. Hartmann's book ""The Last Hours...,"" I have a new found appreciation for what is going on OUTSIDE of my life, and that indeed I CAN make a difference, in fact, I must take responsibility TO make a difference. I felt a comfort on a deep, internal level that somehow the cravings and longings I have been feeling for sometime now are rooted in the ancient teachings of my ancestors, yet because of the fractured surroundings of the culture around me, was unable or possibly unwilling to address my TRUE needs and wants. I thank you Mr. Hartmann and shall do all I can to spread these ancient, yet contemporary words of wisdom."
4,great book!,"this book is perfect for anyone who wants to know about what is seriously wrong with our enviorment, and what we can do to fix it"
3,"Brilliant at times, but lacking in some places","Beginning with a brilliant argument about how all life is made of sunlight--scientifically explained, actually--Hartmann makes a convincing case for sustainability. He also explains how tribal peoples were inherently sustainable, healthier, and how we can learn from their organizations and beliefs. His message is vital and lucid; however, I felt some of his solutions--""Reconnecting with God--directly,"" ""living off the grid,"" and higher spiritual consciousness--in some ways only affirm what has been done for eons without a noticeable global effect. Otherwise, this is mostly on the mark."
3,Where have I heard this before?,"This book, although interesting in many forms seems to have been taken from another source. I do not discredit the author for what he claims to be his own thoughts on the subject but I believe that Daniel Quinn said it much better. The use of certain terms seem to have been lifted directly from the pages of ""Ishmael"" or ""My Ishmael"". Though the ideas in all of these books need to be pushed forward and retold to others I felt as though the author was trying to become a leader himself. He seemed to be telling me ""the right way to live"". There is no right way to live for ""ALL"" people. I may be a bit bitter on the subject at the moment and may later regret these words but they state my feelings at the moment perfectly."
3,Simplistic but still a call to heed.,"For some odd reason, I prefer to have to think through the things I'm reading and come to my own conclusions. (I'm trying to get over that!) Mr. Hartmann's book seemed rather transparently simple in that regard so my enjoyment of the subject matter was somewhat diminished. However, there is no question that Mr. Hartmann's is issueing a call that we must heed: get over our dependence on fossil fuels (ancient sunlight) or be prepared to suffer the consequences. Regardless of how simple or complex the message, I heartily agree. And the sooner, the better."
4,An eye opening book!,"I liked this book! I found it informative, and eye-opening. I couldn't put the book down. I was taken aback with the historical information and dismayed by what I had been mistakenly told in school. When I read the other reviews, I thought am I that much of a sucker, was it really that bad. But I noticed that I am slowly being changed by reading Hartmann's book. It is empowering me to question all that I see and hear. This book is just the beginning but what a beginning."
3,Eye-opening and very thought provoking.,"I started this book out with great anticipation. I found it very informative to begin with, but I got bored after awhile with so much history of the distruction to all of the ancient cultures. I was glad to learn it, but I wanted a little more I could sink my teeth in to. We need a daily bulletin like this book on current statistics. I think it's a good book to start with to make people aware. But it's got to be our job now to do something about it! Thanks Thom for bringing us this book. Think about writing another one with more day to day statistics and let's get peoples attention. I think your really going to half to shake our cages. We're all a little to comfortable."
5,Essential reading in understanding the crisis we face.,"This is the type of book you want everyone to read. In the tradition of Ishmael, yet exceeding more analytical than literary. As the author accurately points out, the fate of the world is altered by a minority who focus, mostly because the majority is not focused.The author is a little repetitive, yet manages to consider most of the key issues both from a technical - geo political- economic perspective as well as a somewhat holistic - metaphysical - sociological persective. One might argue technicalities and statistics on one point or another perhaps, but at the end of the day, Hartmann rises above any particular doomsday prediction and slap bang nails the disturbing yet comforting truth of the 'big picture'. This is where he deserves the rating of '10'."
3,Christmas as it sounded back in the 1940's & 1950's,"The price of the cd pretty much assures the buyer that they have nothing to loose by purchasing this cd. All the songs are recognizable. However, all the performers were at the top of their game back in the 1940's and 1950's. The songs arrangments all have that sound that easily identifies them as having been performed during that time frame. This is not a great album but it has a nice mixture of performers. There are only two artists who appear more than once, and one is Bing Crosby. He performs two songs, Silver Bells and Jingle Bells. Imagine that, he didn't perform White Christmas.This cd will put you in the Christmas mood as it reminds you of your past Christmases."
4,Let's get it straight --,"-- the French cannot rock! My point? They don't need to when they're as good at what they do as Art Zoyd. This is some of the most interesting classically influenced music I've ever heard, maybe the most. They're better than Univers Zero at their best (Ceux du Dehors), and that's saying a lot. Wayyy better than their countrymen Magma. They know how to add the right ""something"" to make the sound more propulsive than, say, Bartok. On this album (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell), the band is just starting to use some electronics to supplement their acoustic instruments. Beautiful results and quite percussive and excellent use of precision timing and ""space is the place,"" etc. Beg, borrow, or steal. The only one better than this is probably an earlier work, Les Espace Inquiets."
5,Snitzer is an innovator who plays with a fresh new style,"Andy Snitzer stirs vibrant emotions in his album Ties that Bind. His fresh command of the Alto and Tenor sax only accents the clever arrangements which enspirit his composition. You can easily associate his cool lines with brisk images familiar yet mysteriously new to your ears. His rock-jazz style gently blends a tasteful, Sanbornesque impetuous line with his own intriguing timber. This album is not only a catch but also a keeper. Buy this one."
5,One of the best Latex resources,"I have tried reading a lot of online articles about learning Latex, and none of them was very helpful. After reading this book for 1 hour, I started creating my own document (which had a pressing deadline). Do buy this book if you are beginner in Latex: the treatment is lucid, helpful and easy-to-read. 95% needs of 90% Latex users will be served by the commands given in this small 60 page book. If you have more advanced needs, this book gives excellent referencs to other, more reference-like Latex books. Oh, and if you are a Windows user, I'd strongly recomment (MikTeX + TeXnicCenter) as your Latex software."
1,Really slow,"This book is so slow I gave up.Who would have thought a vampire Navajo cop novel could be so deadly dull. If I'd had to read one more paragraph about mesquite, huisache and arroyos I would have screamed. Instead I just sent the book to cloud and have no intention of getting it back.I would have accorded this book no stars but that option wasn't available."
3,Heartfelt story,"First, you need to read all three of the Turner books. They are compelling, deep, true but sad and ultimately too depressing to get more than three stars. I wish one of the books had a more upbeat ending. I don't have to have happy endings in all of my books but I don't want to cry over all of them either.I am glad I read the three Turner books but I'll never reread them either."
1,be warned..kindle version unreadable,All:The kindle version of this book is almost completely unreadable.The paragraph spacing in the first five pages makes no sense...simple paragraphs are broken to four and five.Though I really liked the little writing that I read: I returned it right away.
1,"He writes well, but...","Sorry to wreck this little lauditory parade, but the attempts by Sallis to describe Southerners are Walt Disney phony. He might have come from the South, but he writes of the characteristics of the Deep South and its people as an elitist Boston Brahmin might. I guess you have to be a real Southerner to see it, though."
1,Lost me for sure!,"I am very disappointed with Cypress Grove and myself for reading it through to the end. What punishment. The story line wobbles all over the place with flashbacks to Turner's previous various life experiences and then, repeatedly, runs right into disjointed dialogue giving no indication of which characters are conversing. Not much of a storyline, but painfully drawn out to a fairly predictable ending."
1,I paid for this ?,"Not well written. disjointed and hard to read. I kept hoping it would get better, but it did not. very disappointing after the reviews"
1,Confused?!,This is the first book i have read by James Sallis. I found it super confusing jumping from past to present. I didn't understand who the majority of the characters were or what was actually happening. A very hard book to follow or comprehend. I wouldn't suggest it to others. I put it down after the first 10 or so chapters. Very muddled sentencs.
2,disconnected writing,The writing jumped between characters and time too much. It was a slow read and the ending was very disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this book.
3,A bit slow,"The characters were well developed, but the story started slow. The middle picked up a little bit. Then it was slow again.My dad couldn't finish it. I had to - but I always have to, no matter what. It was ok. That's about all I can say about it. Just...ok."
4,Better than average,Interesting if flat characters. Lots of interior dialog. Another victim-of-life hero set in a remote part of a remote state. Nicely executed mystery.
2,wordy....,"Sallis has penned a confusing story full of completely unrelated plots and characters. There is a lot of action in the story... well the second story... the one that is all memories and has nothing to do with the story taking place in the present. Sallis has an amazing gift of description but when I am plodding through a book trying to understand what is supposed to be happening the last thing I want is 3 pages of description of one character.If Sallis were to put more time into just one story instead of about 20 pages of a murder mystery followed by a whole bunch of filler words and confusing flashbacks then I am sure it would be an astounding book. As for Cypress Grove, unless you are studying up on flashy descriptive writing, I can't recommend it."
1,"Disorganized, poor writing","Every other chapter is about the past of the protagonist, but not especially in an ordered way. Those chapters could almost be short stories. The reader goes back and forth from the current plot to the protagonist's past, which does not necessarily seem very relevant to the present case. The outcome is forced."
2,To much jumping around in the story line.,I did not finish this book. Story line was too confusing and hard to keep track of. I can't think of anything else to say about it.
2,Not up to par,"Pretty disappointing, all up.In general, Fforde's heroines display some endearing little quirk that makes them human, such as lying, stealing, breaking and entering and variations of these. In Practically Perfect the heroine's little quirk is that she is not only a liar and a thief, but a whinging selfish little beast - ultimately unlikeable. This wouldn't break the novel, but something goes wrong with the plot and from about halfway it's pretty much a hasty gallop to a cliched ending.Although the novel's intended to be humourous, I don't remember smiling at the laboured antics. Not Fforde's best work."
3,Greyhound stole the show,"Loved the theme of doing up houses running through the book, but found it longer than necessary and the transfer of Anna's affections between guys was handled clumsily. The greyhound, of course, stole the show. Light, undemanding reading: competent chick-lit but not especially memorable."
5,My nephew loved this!,"I'd buy this toy again...he played with it right away this Easter when i gave it to him...I have worked with handicapped toddlers and would have purchased this for my classroom and my 18 month old nephew loved it as well!Kim, M. Ed."
4,"Powders as used in Santeria and Voodoo Mojo, and Gris Gris","This book is good, especially for those who have little knowledge of those mysterious bottled powders sold in Botanicas and voodoo Supply shops. This is not a ""How To"" Guide on making the Powders or Incenses but rather an explanation of the bottled incenses and powders sold in the Shops. These are the famous Powders used in Mojo Bags, gris gris, and prendas. You will learn what those famous Powders such as Seven African Powers, Fast Luck, Graveyard Dust, High John the Conqueror, and Jinx Removing are used for. The section I liked the most where the scattered prayers and invocations thought the book. Anna Riva's collection of books are easy enough for the novice..."
4,A Great Commentary,"I liked this commentary a lot. I have not focused much effort on Mark over the years, but wanted to look at it while I did a complete rereview of my Greek. It was better than I expected. The interesting comments on the Northern - Southern Kingdom's impacts on the cultures of Jerusalem and Galillee were helpful, as were the comments on the book's unlikely chronological layout. It is all good and balanced and worth reading. I for one would have liked more Greek, but it is not a real problem and makes the book for useful for a wider audience."
4,From Continuum:,"""Ecclesiology from below,"" as it operates in this work, is directed to history; it moves through the actual church of history to ecclesiology or to an understanding of the church both as it is and as it should be. In the first volume that passage was fairly explicit because comprehensive ecclesiologies in a sense did not exist. In this volume ecclesiology itself becomes much more directly the subject matter of the book, but without losing sight of concrete history and the degree to which these ecclesiologies are historically conditioned. Put somewhat differently, the main goal of this ""comparative ecclesiology"" is not simply to lay down one after another different ecclesiologies that emerged over the last five hundred years, although that describes the book with empirical accuracy. Its larger intent is to show the richness, vitality, and creativity of the whole church as it moves through history, adjusting to new times, places, and cultures."
4,First Touch with Diana Ross,"I think it's the best one-disk collection of dianas solo recordings you can get, but I miss ""My old piano"" and ""chain reaction""!"
4,Diana Ross's Definitive Collection is Divine,After listening to the album I am very pleased with my purchase. SOngs I have not heard in a long time and loved were there.
3,not really definitive,"if you want all her hits, they are not on this cd. its got most of the biggest, but not all it could be."
5,Clever marketing But recommended.,"Here is why this collection captured my attention...the RCA label Tracks digitally remastered.Mirror Mirror,Muscles,swept away these three tracks alone is worth the price of admission...the sound quality is the BEST you will find anywhere."
3,An enjoyable collection -- despite the fluff...,"Listening to this collection is a little bit like enjoying a guilty pleasure. You get the standard Ross classics (""Touch Me In The Morning,"" ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"") along with her lighter-than-air pop hits from the late 80's, during her stint with RCA Records (""Swept Away,"" ""Muscles,"" ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love,"" ""Mirror, Mirror""), but that's part of exactly what makes this such fun. It also makes the compilation miles ahead of the awful ""Greatest Hits: The RCA Years,"" released a few years back. I was glad to see one of my personal favorites, ""Last Time I Saw Him,"" included here, and the melodic ""It's My Turn"" shows Diana at her most emotive and least bombastic. Overall, a good place to finally get the bulk of her best-known solo hits in one place."
4,A Classic Artist,I enjoyed this compliation album of Ms. Ross's Classics. I wish that the extended version of Love Hangover had been included in this set. The remastering of these songs make them sound better than ever.
4,Great for Price and Small Yard,This is great for $20! Don't expect to easily whack away weeds if your yard has overgrown into a jungle. Slightly on the small side but works great for keeping a small yard trim and neat.
1,THE TRIMMER WAS ON FIRE,DONT BUY THIS I WAS USEING IT AND THE THING WAS ON FIRE!!!! I HAD TO RUN IN THE HOUSE AND GET WATER AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME USEING IT
3,B&D Trimmer,Bought this item for my wife to use.Good for light duty. Light weight. Would not recommend for larger yards. Does an adequate job.
3,Missing Hardware,The weedeater works fine but it did not come with instructions or hardware to put it together. I had to buy nuts and bolts inorder to use it.
4,"Solid, it ain't","I like this thing. You definitely get what you pay for; a light duty trimmer. I have never used a trimmer so it took me some time to learn the how to hold the thing. I would recommend this to anyone with a small yard who is a very casual gardener, like me!"
3,Grass trimmer,Kind of small had to bend over to even touch the spot I wanted to cut. But at the price I paid I'm not complaining it does its job period.
2,too short,This was cheap and you get what you pay for. It is much too short and kills your back slouching over. It has very little power and struggles to cut anything. I can't recommend it.
4,Black & Decker Electric Weed Trimmer,"Replaced an electric Toro trimmer that lasted 20 years. Motor is not as powerful but adequate. Heavier than previous trimmer but light compared to most electric trimmers available today. Bump feed works adequately, although there is sometimes a delay in the feed (must run full speed for several seconds after bump feed before line advances). Plastic case seems fairly rugged. Overall seems decent so far for the price, which was cheap."
3,little guy,"When I bought this I was a new home owner and was looking to save money because there are SO many things you need. It works, but it is small and has almost no guard. I have used it for edging (which it is not meant for) and been hit in the face by debris. It is also uncomfortable for me to use as I am over 6 feet tall. It has plenty of power and for 20$ it did its job. I am looking to buy a larger trimmer though. I would buy it if you need to do a lot of trimming in tight spaces or want to save money, but don't expect a great experience."
2,Works well but immediately loses screws!!!!!!!!,I love how this little weed eater is so quiet and pretty well designed EXCEPT that all of the screws that hold it together fall out and are lost in the grass within minutes of assembly and usage! VERY AGGREVATING!
2,This Trimmer is so bad.,"This trimmer is not good, I only used two times this trimmer that has smoking.So I hope it can changed another one."
1,Useless Tool,"Just be patient when use this machine, it has no power and it is useless, do not waste you money."
3,"OK for small jobs, but messy","This trimmer is a step down from the last electric weed whacker I used. It can get the job done, but it doesn't do it as quickly - I find that I have to be much more careful in my technique, or the string will simply brush over grass blades and weeds without cutting them. My other beef is that there isn't a sufficient guard on the back side to keep my feet and legs from getting sprayed with clippings. I have to remember to change into old clothes before using this.That said, when I bought this, I figured that for the price it didn't have to be that good to be worth it, and from that standpoint, I'd say it met expectations. If you need to do a lot of trimming, go for something better. But if you just need a trimmer occasionally, this should do the job just fine."
2,cheap not working well,"Pro: cheap, cheapCon: this is the first time I use electric grass trimmer, apparantly [NOT enough power] to edge the glass, maybe I should buy one over $100, but this one is just too disappointed. I strongly NOT recommand this."
1,assembly,This thing is impossible to assemble and it still isn't done right. My wife duct taped it together. The screws do not align correctly. I wouldnt buy another if you paid me.
4,"Gets the job done, and NO gasoline","This is the first grass trimmer (weed-wacker) of any kind that I've ever owned. I love that it just plugs in, so I don't have to make friends with a gasoline container. I wish it had a wider radius of destruction, but it still gets things done without too much effort.Since it's electric, I thought it would have been whisper quiet. It is not. Keep in mind that it's nowhere near as loud as it's gasoline brethren, it's still loud enough to get the neighborhood dogs to initiate a long distance conference.It's a great little device, and along with the electric lawnmower that I bought, this allowed me to fire my gardener.He broke my back window and tried to act like the wind broke it.The wind.Way to take responsibility for your actions buddy.Bottom line: The electric gas trimmer is solid. I recommend it!"
1,Absolute Piece of Shoddy Garbage,"That's right, absolute piece of SHODDY garbage. Not only is it garbage, it is shoddy garbage. The thing is so weak and flimsy. Putting it together was actually a pain. I thought it would be simple, but the little triangles are actually kind of hard to find. Once I put the thing together, the plastic casing was splitting and bulging. Does not feel safe to use, at all.The thing is so short and small. It's the perfect size if I wanted my dog to trim the yard. I stand at 5'10, I had to bend down to reach the ground with this garbage. Used it for a few minutes before I started feeling it in my back. Don't even want to go through the whole mess of returning it, I'll just deal with the loss.Do not recommend this for anyone. Pay a little bit more money to get a solid trimmer."
1,Waste of Money,I purchased this and within 2 wks the motor was smoking - totally ruined. And this was for doing minor yard work - I previously had a much larger amp trimmer - this 1.8 amp takes alot longer - I would not advise anyone to buy this.
4,Great product for the price,"This little grass trimmer has done a spectacular job of trimming the grass, weeds and ivy around the house. It's lightweight and gets the job done. I gave it only four stars as there is a plug-in socket at the top of the handle which can be a nuisance at times. By nuisance - it comes unplugged from the power. Other than that it's great."
4,Works fine for what it is,"I just got this tiny machine home to Japan in my luggage and tried it out. Yes, it is underpowered, but that could also have to do with the 100-volt supply here. But that said it does exactly what I need it for, to trim edges where my mower can't reach. It is not really too short for me, and I can swing it like a one-handed scythe because it is so light.I was totally disgusted with my much more expensive Makita that would never feed the line properly, so I feel the Black and Decker is worth $19.95 for every time I don't need to swear and pull the Makita reel apart to rewind it!"
4,Good Deal - Lightweight,"I needed a trimmer that could clean up a fence line of about 60' and clean up around a few landscaping objects. This trimmer has fit the bill and at a great price. There is nothing fancy about this trimmer, but it does what it is supposed to do. It is also very light weight. All that said, I won't be surprised if I need to replace this item after a couple of seasons. But if and when I do need to replace it, I'll buy the same one. At the current price it's practically a disposable."
4,B & D ST1000,Does a decent job for a lightweight trimmer. Easy to use & small enough to get around in tight areas. String bump advancer works perfectly & the cord holder notch on the back of the handle helps keep the cord from pulling out too often. Mine came in black.
4,Very Handy,Great little trimmer. Very easy to put together. Very easy to use. Smaller than i expected but still a great product.
2,Pretty weak trimmer,"I'm not satisfied with it. It's a basic, bottom of the line trimmer. It doesn't edge well and fails to cut some of the bigger weeds in my yard. You get what you pay for!"
5,Works for Me,"This is lightweight and cheap, but for $24 it does what I need.I have a very small backyard and my lawn service cuts and trims every 2 weeks. Some weeds spring up, especially around my patio. I bought this for light trimming between my routine lawn care and it does fine for that. I had no problem assemblying it and if you put the cord into the slot on the handle like the directions say, you will have no trouble with it becoming unplugged.Just remember, it is light weight and not as well balanced as bigger more professional weed eaters, but for a cheap solution to a small problem, it is great."
1,Bad product.,I have a small yard and it's mostly cement so I needed the trimmer to cut the few weeds that we do get.I used 3 times and after that it started to smoke and then it died. I know it's only a couple of bucks this should have lasted me at leat 9 or 10 uses....It didn't!!!
5,Love this little trimmer!,"I read the other reviews so I ordered it! I'm glad I did. I used it today and it works very well on trimming the grass around my yard and for trimming along the driveway and sidewalks. I tilted it sideways and did a little edging. It is small, but it works and it's not heavy at all. I could have used it for hours!"
2,The weeds are laughing their grasses off.,"I own a powerful Ryobi dual string trimmer that can bring down a small jungle, but maintaining the spool and the string is a nightmare, so I bought this simple little trimmer thinking I could use it for a quick trim around my grass.It's not quick! It's underpowered and the cutting swath is about two inches less than I really need. It got the job done, but I didn't save any time, and in the long run that means I didn't save any money. The only thing saves were the lives of weeds.This is great if you've got a little postage stamp lawn with wimply little grass that just gets out of line on occasion and you have to trim it back. If you have any serious crabgrass you need to get under control, forget it and buy a real weed whacker."
4,Great for small yards!,"I have a relatively small backyard so buying this item seemed like the right choice. After trying it out, it does do the job pretty well. There is a decent amount power to cut a yard about 20' x 6'. The trimmer is light, easy to use and covenient to store away in a closet.The only complaint I really have is that it is indeed small to use. If you are on the taller side, there is a great deal of hunching or bending over to use it. Your back will be sore after a while."
4,great trimmer,"It's a great trimmerno problems like few i had.I like how you don't have to removethe string cap to extend the string,by press & extend .it's a nice feature."
4,A decent edge trimmer,"For the price, I am not sorry I bought this trimmer. It is very underpowered, and for trimming the edge of the grass around my mobile home it now takes me twice as long as my last trimmer. But, it works! When cutting the grass that was vining up my irrigation pipe (a ritual of mine), the bottom spool came flying off. Not very reassuring. It popped back on, and works fine, but wow, this thing can't take anything but plain not too thick grass."
4,Just what I was looking for,"Perfect trimmer for my small backyard in conjunction with my push mower. Light, quiet and easy to move around. I don't even waste my time using my push mower on the small patch of grass in front of my house as this does the job better in less time. Seems pretty durable after a few uses. Only critique is I wish it had a longer string or dual strings for quicker trimming."
1,customer service at Black and Decker is horrible online,"I looked over the Black and Decker electric trimmers/edgers and there were some negative reviews that scared me, i.e. catch on fire, can't assemble, etc. So I wanted to let Black and Decker know some of Amazons' customer reviews. It took me 4 times to even be able to send a comment and I don't know if it was sent. Not customer friendly, in my opinion."
1,Too much headache.,"I ordered this product because of the 5 star. when I received it worked for a couple of minutes and suddenly I smell the smoke. it burned. I contacted customer service and they told me to return to any office nearby. I returned and they sent me another one. The same issue happened. After some minutes, it stopped working. If you don't want headache, don't buy this product. Because if you return, you have to waste half a day of work to find the closest office. Because they don't open saturday neither sunday. I hope this comment could help others to avoid the same issues I had. Regards, Serginho."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this trimmer to work on a small front yard, thinking it would save me time and hassle. Well, it worked the opposite way. The trimmer is very noisy, I don't think my neighbors appreciate it even though I avoid the early morning hours. The thing is just plain noisy. Another issue is the power cable hook up. I plug my extension cord into the slot, which is located near the handle. Well, if I move the trimmer from side to side repeatedly as if cutting the grass the cord will come off. I have to plug it in several times while working and this is annoying. Third issue is the mess. By the time I am done there are grass clippings all over my shoes, legs and pants (even though I try to be careful and keep it away from me while cutting).This product is affordable but not worth it. I ended up buying a gas-powered trimmer and got better results."
2,YOU MUST BEND OVER,"VERY SHORT HANDLE AND IT HURTS MY BACK. TO EDGE, YOU MUST TURN TRIMMER OVER AND BEND OVER LIKE YOUR PICKING STRAWBERRIES. BLACK AND DECKER MAKES HIGH QUALITY MERCHANDISE, SO SPEND MORE AND GET A STRONGER MOTOR, A LONGER HANDLE, AND A TRIMMER THAT YOU CAN EDGE WITH. IF YOU HAVE A YARD THAT IS 1000 SQ. FT. OR LESS, THIS WILL DO, BUT ANYTHING LARGER, YOU'LL BREAK YOUR BACK TRIMMING AND EDGING. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, ""YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR""."
5,Love It,works very well. It was just what my husband wanted. It was easy to use and it was most economical.
2,No power,"I have a very small yard. I thought this would be a great trimmer, but sadly I was wrong.I purchased this since it was intended to be use by those with small yards, and light trimming needed. The trimmer has no power to it. After about a foot of the area you wish to trim a hour has gone by. Save your money and get a better trimmer."
4,Great Little Trimmer,"Pretty light weight, works great you just need to find the right cutting angle sometimes. My lawn is about 15'x 30' and it worked great as an edger, and prefect for trimming around the sprinklers in the front yard. If your looking for something for a small to medium job this should work perfect for you.good luck"
1,dont buy,"It has very little cutting power, you have to sweep it 2 to 3 times for every cut. Even worse, after 2 days use, yes, 48 hrs use, something burned at the head, no fire, but I smoke burned fume, and it never will start again. I called black & Decker for info and was not able to get in contact with a live operator. End of story, dont buy."
1,Don't Buy this trimmer,"I bought this mini and weak trimmer just because it's cheap. But I would like to remind you not to buy this. I only used twice and returned for the refund in 30 days. The second time I used it only took less than 10 minutes, then the electric motor blew off smelly smoke, burned I thought.This trimmer is not powerful enough. It's too weak to handle even a small garden. Use your hands and manual trimmer for your small garden is even better and quick than using this short arm trimmer. This is a bad product no matter how cheap it is.Amazon won't let me post the review if I refuse to rate it (zero star). So I rated it one star instead."
2,Not for edging lawns,"I purchase this to edge a fairly small yard and for light weeding. Pros - The string does seem to feed well, it's light and it's cheap. The Cons - Not recommended for edging as the unit is too short and requires you to bend over in an awkward position. The 9"" also is not large enough for my use as it is difficult to reach the ground other than in a very small area. The power is adequate for my needs - barely. I suspect I will go back to a 14"" model. My old Weeder Eater worked reasonable well for my needs and to rotating head work like a charm when moving from weeding to edging. I should have tried this out at the hardware store first."
2,Headed for recycling,"It would have been easier and quicker to use a nail scissors to do the job. I found I had to get very close to the area being trimmed, and despite the line being at full length, only got about a 4 inch area. To edge, the trimmer needed to be turned on its side and actually held against the grass.The advantage is its light weight, but this is offset by the marked vibration, which makes it difficult to hold for any length of time. And although the cord is secured to the handle, that doesn't stop it from popping out of the electrical connection frequently.I had a previous Black and Decker trimmer, which lasted 20 years. Unfortunately, the trend is for bigger and more cumbersome trimmers. I'm glad to read the review of this one which says it's ""disposable"". It's headed for recycling."
3,Just OK,"The product is just ok, I probably would have sent back, but cheap enough soit will work in a few areas around the home, and I did not want to pay return shipping. Will just keep practicing to get better performance I think. I am sure it will be ok for smalljobs. As usual you get what you pay for."
4,Cuts well,"The other reviews told me what I needed to buy this. It's light, not too unwieldy, easy to use. My hands were tired the first couple of times I used it trying to reach too far. Now I just balance it & swing it lightly back & forth. Cuts fast, cuts well. Doesn't tear up other things closeby.Only downsides are that you can't see exactly where you are cutting and long extension cords need to be re-wrapped when done."
2,works ok if your 5 foot,"Im 6'2"" and this thing is tiny. I always have to hunch over. I wish i bought a longer weed eater. Also i wish it was more powerful."
3,Roller Table,"I was surprised at how heavy this roller table is. While that's good in one way it doesn't help when I'm lugging it on and off a truck to set it up at a site.Perhaps it was just a fluke, but I had a very hard time getting one of the legs to open the first time I tried. I almost decided to take it to the manufacturer, which is local to me, and have them show me what I'm doing wrong. I eventually got it open by myself. Once open, I lubed everything and haven't had any more problems."
2,Incomplete,Biased compilation of work. Does not include complete work of private companies that invest private money in the interest of recovering shipwrecks archaeologically. For a person that ran the Vancouver Museum there is no sign of any work he did while there.
4,A traditional favorite!,"Ben Keith is a very talented musician/producer and this recording is solid proof. Joined by an all star cast, Ben soothes and slides his way through some traditional Christmas favorites. Personally, I could do without the vocals (not that I don't appreciate Neil Young, Johnny Cash, etc.) it's just that I think Ben could have pulled off releasing an all instrumental recording. His pedal steel guitar playing is excellent (as always) and is a beautiful instrument to interpret these Christmas songs."
3,a disappointment,"I had high hopes for this set, given my appreciation for several other sets (Sarah Vaughan, Bob Wills) on the Proper label. This set falls somewhat short of the usual excellent job by this label -- the sound quality of many of the cuts is poor and muddy and many of the cuts sound like out-takes. The booklet provides no information about the recordings but is a summary mostly taken from the (poorly written and redundant) Jones biography written by Bob Allen. Overall, I do not recommend this 2 CD set. Although no company (come on get with it Bear Family!) has stepped up and done the definitive Jones anthology, most of the songs on this Proper set are available elsewhere with better sound quality."
1,Garbage,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This box set is pure garbage. There are way better George Jones collections out there!! Trust me and the other reviewers, get something else. I don't know how someone gave this 3 stars. I wish I could get a refund for the star that I had to give it."
1,Not Worth It,"Every Proper box set or ""Introduction"" I've purchased has been really great but this is the one exception. The sound is very poor and it seems the familiar songs might be different recordings (or maybe it's just the poor sound). By the track listing this seems like a great collection, but I found it so disappointing I didn't bother wasting the space in iTunes for it."
2,"This is an desent book, but not the best.","Cassie Edwards book ""Savage Tears"" is a below average book. This book was borring and uninteresting!! I could put the book down in the middle of a sentence, if I was interrupted. If I would have know ""Savage Tears"" was as borring as it is I wouldn't even started to read it. But now you know what I think of ""Savage Tears"" and may be you'll take my word for it, this book is not worth looking at"
2,dont do it,if you think that this is the international singles cd its not!! its 3 cds full of stupid interviews
2,Sooo Sad!,"I am soo disappointed right now. I waited so long for this video to be released here in the US. I am a big W&G fan. But feel duped. The package says running time 87 minutes. But it is only 30!! The 30 minute video itself is funny but not nearly as good as Were Rabbit or any of the previous episodes. Plus, it is a bit more scary for kids! Ugh...hopefully after we wait another 3 years it will not be as disappointing."
3,scared my son!,"I guess Wallace and Gromit are more for older kids and adults beacause this one scared my 3 year old so much that he doesn't want to watch ANY Wallace and Gromit dvd's now. He used to like them, and he still loves Shaun the Sheep, but this one has to be shelved indefinitely. I'm not even sure that he got the idea that the lady was a serial killer but he understood her dog being abused."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"The main feature is only 30 minutes. If you add up all of the special features, then you get the total running time of 87 minutes. I say the description on the back of the box is very deceptive. It was an impulse purchase because I'm a fan of Wallace and Gromit, but A Matter Of Loaf or Death isn't worth the money."
2,Bait and Switch,"The actual Wallace and Gromit portion of this disc is quite good, of course, BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH OF IT.Most of the material is ads and ""freebies"".I was quite disappointed."
3,Sorely disappointed in the story,"The kids liked it well enough, but the adults were very disappointed in the lack of creativity and cleverness we've grown to expect. This had none of the visual puns or sneaky cultural references of Were Rabbit. Gromit saves the day, as usual, but not in any particularly clever way. **Spoiler alert*** the big finale is basically a fart joke. Really? From Wallace and Gromit? Nick Park, we expected so much more...As other reviewers mentioned, it's also fairy short. Longer than the ""features"" (The Wrong Trousers, etc.) but not nearly as long as Were Rabbit.Bottom line: a must if you're a fan, but it will probably collect some dust after the first viewing."
1,"not a feature, misleading and not all that great anyway","""87 minutes"" is says on the package, I should have looked closer at the amazon site that notes it is really just 30 minutes.Really, what video has ever included ""extras"" as part of the running time?Plus the story is only so-so, not nearly as good as the previous stuff. In the making of bit someone even notes how they could take short cust since it wasn't ""a feature movie"" Okay- and I guess they did take short cuts.Back to watching Were Rabbit again, that is a classic and the one to get if you don;t know WAG already..."
1,So Disappointed,"I love Wallace and Grommit and everything they have done...up to this point. I bought this movie and was SO excited about watching it...and then I did. This morning. It was awful. It was too rushed, there was none of that subtle British humor and it was very dark in its storyline. If you love Wallace & Grommit I do NOT recommend you purchase this movie. If I could return it, I would."
3,Classic Wallace and Gromit,"but FAR TOO SHORT! That's the reason for only 3 stars actually...reading the description of the title, it sounded like it was roughly 90 minutes...but sadly I think its the entire DVD contents that is about 90 minutes as this title can't be more than about 25 minutes. It has all the charm and wit of all the other of their titles but it's far too short...especially following a feature length film like The Were Rabbit (still one our family night favorites). I've been watching stuff from Nick long before Aardman when he was just coming out with his early stuff and I'm a huge fan...content wise this is not a disappointment...just the length. It developed well (quickly of course) and let you the TWR did as to who the culprit is...just left me very unsatisfied at the end...wanting for more...which is really just what any director strives for eh. Still a good viewing...NOT a feature length film."
5,Another winner from Aardman Studios!,"No one does claymation better than Aardman Studios. Combine that with very clever story-telling and the result is a short film (about 30 minutes) that will appeal to both adults and children. Kids will miss many of the subtle jokes (and some might actually find this story intense and a bit too scary), but overall this is a must-see, must-own addition to the DVD collection of anyone who is a fan of Wallace and Gromit."
2,What happened to the quality of Wallace and Gromit?!?!,"Being a big fan of anything Wallace and Gromit, I was really excited when I heard about A Matter of Loaf or Death. After reading the reviews on Amazon... I wasn't so sure. I am so happy I got it through Netflix instead of buying it!!! What a disappointment! While the animation was fabulous, the story line was weak and not thought out. I was surprised by the violence towards the poodle by Piella. I wouldn't recommend this for children. Again, very~very disappointing. I won't be wasting my money on this DVD."
2,Where is the Wallace & Grommet original humor?,Disappointing. Not the original ideas or humor as the previous animations. More like a rehash of old stories.
2,Half baked,"This is about a half-hour feature, and in my opinion is not classic as the first three Wallace and Gromit shorts were from the 1990's.First of all, one of the wonderful things about W and G is that it's fun for the grown-ups and the kiddies, but starting off with someone being murdered wasn't so fun and wasn't something I wanted to be part of ""family movie night"".And, they give away the murderer right off the bat so it's really not a mystery at all, just something to sit through. What were they thinking?"
4,Add Loaf and Death to your W&G collection,"As said in the special features, this is a half-hour Wallace and Gromit movie done on a TV budget. Maybe not as amazing as Were Rabbit, but still an essential for any W&G fan."
3,"decent enough ,but running time is actually only around 30 minutes not 87","while i enjoyed this latest animated Wallace and Gromit feature,a fewthings disappointed me.the biggest thing,(and i'm sure others havementioned this)is the running time.both the the artwork on the DVD andthe case list it as being 87 minutes.however,the actual running time isaround the 30 minute mark.not sure why the discrepancy.the other thingthat disappointed me was the lack of humour compared to Wallace andGromit and the Curse of the Wererabbit.there were some humorousmoments,but not as many as i expected,and what humour there was,wasmuch more subtle.although there many amusing moments,there were no reallaugh out loud moments here for me.i did however like the story,butbecause the film was so short,i don't feel they developed itenough.still,overall,it was a pleasant watch.for me,Wallace and Gromitin A Matter of Loaf and Death is a 3/5"
2,Not Quality Wallace and Gromit,"I am a huge Wallace and Gromit fan so it is almost painful for me to rate this one so low. All other Wallace and Gromit material I rate with five stars. However, this one gets only two stars from me because it is a bit violent for young children and I was disturbed by the scenes with animal abuse. The entire DVD lacks the wholesome fun that is associated with Wallace and Gromit and make it a must miss for all ages."
3,Decent addition to the Wallace & Gromit catalog; packaging is misleading,"This isn't as clever as the first three Wallace & Gromit shorts, but it's worth seeing if you like them.My main problem with this is that the packaging lists the run time as 87 minutes. I saw it in the store and figured it was a new straight to video movie and gladly paid the ten dollars for it. I was very disappointed to have it end just before reaching a half an hour. I guess they included the special features in the length too (though I don't think the special features were over an hour). Dirty trick.I see the other shorts are now also for sale individually with run times listed as 62 minutes. I assume this is the case with those too. I can understand releasing this new one separately for people who have the previous ones but I don't get releasing the original three individually, they were always packaged together. Seems like they're trying to milk as much money out of these as possible."
1,the disappointing effort,"After enjoying many wallace and grommit adventures, I think something has happened to our creator folks. This effort is a waste of time and money. Don't do it."
3,Good movie. Bad disc.,"While this one's not up to par with the previous three short films, it's still pretty good. The disc, however, isn't. Full screen? Come on."
4,It's good but a bit too short in length.,"This movie is good but its a bit too short in length. It's 2 main characters get into some more trouble as well as make it out in the end like they do in all of their movies. This flick is good, charming and entertaining just like their other movies but it's one issue that I mentioned needs to be fixed; other than this issue, this movie is good to watch. I like it. 8.5/10"
3,theme is not for kids! but still the great fun you expect from Peter Sallis,"I bought this for the kids since they loved Wallace and Gromit (the three short adventures and Curse of the WereRabbit) so much. I didn't check the rating before I purchased, nor did I really look closely at the story line. Obviously not suitable for 3-yr olds! But we still love all the puns, as we loved previous W&G films. Three stars only to reflect the fact that this is the first time I've seen W&G deviate from being super-children-friendly stories. I would probably rate it a 4-and-a-half otherwise, only because I thought the story was too short!"
2,WHO wrote this!?,"I've seen and enjoyed all the Wallace & Gromit films UNTIL NOW.""Loaf or Death"" was a severe departure from the charm of this series. Other than the fun gadgetry that is part of every story, there is nothing to save this film from the gratuitously dark, unfunny, and frankly terrible story. With all the work that goes into this art form, it's a wonder that they wasted their time on such awful writing.I recommend all their other features, but give this one a pass."
3,Lesser quality follow up to Curse movie,"Good but lacks the depth of Curse movie. Nothing really new here. Also, this movie lacks the suspense of Trousers too."
5,marvelous movie. just exelent!,just exelent. im a huge fan of wallace and gromit and everything related to aardman. i guarantee this movie is the best of the best. fun for the whole family.
2,"So-So, at Best","Eh! It was ok, but 'Loaf and Death' should be more than that. We've come to expect a lot from Wallace & Gromit and an 'ok' release is not ok.The storyline seems a bit rushed and ill thought out. And even in stop-motion, I'm never down with animal cruelty.The puns and one-liners seem haphazard and thrown together way to quickly; much like the entire film.I hate to say it, but this gets 2 stars mostly for history, not for execution. They can do better. They HAVE done better."
1,complete trash,"Dear Mr ParkWhile you are listed as the writer and director of ""Loaf and Death"", I seriously doubt that you had anything to do with it. In fact, I hope you had nothing to do with it. It would be a shame, if someone as talented as you are, were responsible for this abomination.It was violent, Wallace and Gromit had both lost their personalities and lacked any of the traditional W & G charm that we all love. Both W & G were actually minor characters and that big, fat annoying woman was the main focus of the whole show. What on earth was this director thinking?Please get control of your characters back from whichever talentless morons you sold them to and make us some more wonderful W & G adventures.Thank you"
1,Ultra Media Dashboard,Did not work on my system. Memory sticks and flash cards gave not enough power warning.
1,Aweful company to deal with,"Died after 3 months of use. When customer service was called they said I did not register the product, which I did. They said I had to prove to them that I registered the product. His name was John and he was very rude. When I asked for a manager he put me on indefinite hold. Do not buy products from this company as they are very cheap and they will not honor their Lifetime Warranty as they conveniently cannot find your registration."
2,poor performance,"it not was useful for me. a lot of cables inside. no power on usb. no connector firewire inside my mobo. maybe for another people. cheap, I do not want make a rma for this product. Amazon.com best electronic marketplace."
1,"Poor product, avoid!","I was never able to get this thing to work correctly. Initially, the card reader would work if I applied pressure to the SD card in exactly the right place. Then it stopped working completely. One of the USB ports also did not work, even after switching cables on the motherboard."
5,All-Star Cast of Contemporary Jazz Musicians,"Although MoodSwing retains some traditional stylings, Redman sparks a contemporary and very refreshing jazz synergy with Brad Mehldau on piano, Christian McBride on bass and Brian Blade on drums. MoodSwing was released in 1994 and I agree with the previous reviewers that stated this recording really set the stage for the creative evolution of these talented musicians in becoming the contemporary jazz leaders they currently are.As a result of Redman's superior improvisational skills, the selections on MoodSwing do seem lyrical in their expression and this is a large part of what makes this project so enjoyable to listen to. Every track is a perfectly crafted joy to the ear.If you are new to jazz or to Joshua Redman, you will want to add the sound of this incredibly talented quartet to your collection."
3,Quite good,"This is a quite good 3.5 star album. Joshua Redman is of course, excellent, and he has a fine group with him - Brad Mehldau, Christian McBride, and Brian Blade. Mr. Redman wrote all the songs, yet the thing that irks me is that I can hear references to other jazz songs in them. So, the first time through the album sounded very familiar. I think if the album were a little livelier, a little less mannered, that would have pushed it into 4-star territory for me."
2,"Interesting point of view, but not very informative.","This book was written by a pawn-shop owner, and I believe the author provides a good summary of how haggling works from that point of view.A substantial portion of the book is spent explaining how to appraise diamonds and firearms, which does eventually relate back to the main theme, but seems superfluous and added merely as filler. With a book less than 60 pages, filler material is most unwelcome. I read the book cover to cover in about 20 minutes, and it felt more like reading a high-school essay on pawn-shops than a book about human nature."
4,Best $35 I have ever spent,They say Americans don't like to haggle. This doesn't mean you can't do it in almost every purchasing situation. This book inspired me.
3,A BASIC GUIDE TO PRICE HAGGLING,"Like the title suggests this book about how to haggle over prices and (hopefully) save some money. While there are suggestions I thought where questionable as for as ethics and morals go (and wouldn't employ them because of that), there are good tips and techniques to be had that anyone can apply. It all boils down to knowing when and where to haggle and having the nerve to try. One of my personal experiences is that I bought a photographer's vest to use for concealed handgun carry at a gun show some time ago, the asking price was $60, but I asked and came away with the vest for $45! The moral of the story is it never hurts to try; the worst that can happen is someone might say no.All in all this book is good basic guide, just remember to be honest, respectful, know when to walk off, and remember if you never ask the answer is always no. Good luck."
2,Maybe common knowledge,"I bought this book for my husband who is the ultimate bargainer. He always wants to get a better deal than anyone else. It would have been the perfect gift if it had some more useful information. After reading it, I didn't come out with any new information, and neither did my husband. It also had some explicit words. Not very happy with it."
5,Another 5-Star Mighty Joe Moon Review,"This album is indeed brilliant: the aural equivalent of Heaven, I suppose. I could not possibly say anything that differs greatly from the other wonderful reviews here, but I do agree that this is not only one of the greatest albums of the 90's, but one of the most overlooked.When I purchased this in 1994, I recall keeping it on repeat for hours. Whether awake or asleep, it would be playing, and I even recall many nights where I wouldn't sleep just so I could hear it a few more times. Calling this terrific or even perfect is an understatement."
5,GLB can never steer us wrong.,This was the first GLB cd that i got. It was amazing after hearing them with Pearl Jam in '94. I didn't even know that Fuzzy or Like a Shot existed. This was the cd that hooked me. It's brilliant from start to finish. Lonestar song rocks. Mockingbirds is just a song all its own and who am i kidding? The CD cannot be topped. Well not at least until Jubilee was released. Oh by the way go buy Jubilee it's the best
5,GLB's best,"This is one of my favorite albums and I very much recommend it. This band is not as well-known as it should be and this album is the place to start. It not only features really inspired songwriting -- just check out ""Mockingbirds"" -- but touching lyrics which avoid cliches and some excellent singing. The album is more than solid from first track to last and it really hangs together. ""Might Joe Moon"" isn't a theme album, but the alternative/electric folk style (the best description I can think of) is unified without being uniform. The only weak link is the bass playing (the band recently replaced the bass player), which is unskilled and uninspired, but that is a relatively minor flaw. Although I was somewhat disappointed by ""Copperopolis"" (despite the fine lyrics), I am looking forward to hearing ""Jubilee."" Glad to see other fans are clued into this great album!"
3,It's The Life,"You go out and buy this for the song ""It's The Life.""Mockingbirds is good and maybe a few other tracks but it's no masterpiece.""It's The Life"" is the goods.You will weep in your beer and drink it all up."
4,uplifting and real,"this cd just makes me feel so real, so natural. it's beautiful in that sense. the sound of dobro guitars, mandolins, banjos, etc. just give the ambience of rural america. lyrically, 'it's the life' talks of a person who is self-destructing, yet is doing it 2 themselves; 'demon called deception' talks about redemption from evil. very spiritual in tone without being preachy or dogmatic. in this way it's not going 2 burden your listening experience. 'mockinbirds' has some sgt. pepper/pet sounds in it; overall the songwriting is excellent."
5,all trainers must read this,"when I started training kids to ride I lacked the knowledge of specific exercises to isolate each part of the rider. George gives you every tool to do what he does with his clients, follow it like its the bible. At my farm a copy is kept is the trunk, it is considered the manual and it settles disputes quickly. He teaches you not only how to train a rider, but also the quality standards that true horsemen demand. This one needs to be in print, all people out there trying to be trainers should have a copy of this close by, I suggest following it to the letter. Thank you George Morris and Gordon Wright, you have raised my expectations for my students and for myself."
4,Susan Bourdet's watercolor calendars are wonderful,"Wonderful watercolor paintings, which I enjoy looking at every day! I wish the smaller format, that was available in 2006 but not published in 2007, could be made available again in 2008 for this calendar. I certainly hope that Susan Bourdet will indeed made a 2008 watercolor paintings calendar."
4,I like it!,"I'm not a music critic, so all I can say is that I like it. I can't find this CD for some time now, which makes me sad, as I'd like to listen to it again."
4,Good at what they do,"This is pop-punk. That might turn some people off but it is really just too good to ignore. The vocals are different and somewhat nasal but they fit with the music. It's fast-paced and powerful, with awesome build-ups and soaring, driving choruses that pick you up and pull you in. I love the way they keep the drumbeat thumping in many of the choruses, somewhat reminiscent of some Taking Back Sunday. Anyway, overall a real solid album and I hope they come out with another. Tracks 12 and 13 are standouts for me."
5,Nicer than Other Systems,This system has solved many of the bugs of the old version of disposable bottle. I love the drop in liners for quickie bottles. I hated fighting with the rolls of bags the old system used. The nipples go back and forth to work with a non disposable version. I rarely desire to use those normal avent bottles now that the Tempo is so easy to put together and use.Like others have mentioned this style is not easily found. Ordering liners online may be easier sometimes than messing with hunting them down.
4,I love these and so does baby,"Easy to use. Liner collapses, easy to clean and they intergrate with other Avent products and are BPA free.Cons: you have to wash the lid- but the lid is really innovative in that it has little holes that get the air out.For some reason the screw on area of my holder break of in little pieces, so i got a new holder today."
4,Pretty Good,"My 15 month old son likes this DVD, but his favorites are ""A Celebration of Me - Grover"", Elmo's Sing-Along Guessing Game"", & ""Learning About Letters"". Overall, I would recommend this DVD."
5,Very nice--keeps coffee warm!,"Wonderful, good quality mug, love the saying and it's a nice way to start the day plus it actually keeps my coffee warm"
4,Good loud horn,"Certainly a loud horn. Nice white finish. Easy installation. Couple of negatives. Compressor is very loud. Mount in an area that allows you to close out noise. Small items were not included for example an in line fuse. Should have been included. Also, the air line easily kinks at the connectors. Had to buy ribbed right angle connectors. Again, small but should have been included."
3,cosmetic with some dents,"this horn set was dented up pretty bad...itsnot that critical for me, so i am gonna keepit...after the fact i wished i had gone aheadand paid regular price for the product...itwasnt worth it with the parts bent up...i wasexpecting a scratch not dented..you would havethought that they would have repacked it tokeep it from being further damaged...but notso...anyway it was the horns i ordered andthey did ship timely...thanks a lot for theservice but it would have been nice if you wouldhave shot actual pictures so that i couldhave made a better decision.don from houston"
1,Homophobic nonsense!,"If my son sees me naked, I am encouraging him to be homosexual??? Give me a break. For me, the few positive aspects were over-shadowed by the closed mindedness. I was shocked to see that it was originally published in 1988 and not 1948. The best part of the book is the photo of the precious baby on the front cover. Otherwise I do not recommend it."
2,good intentions but.....,"a lttle heavy on the chrstianity, a little light on the reality. had some good stuff on chores around the house and encouraging that. when reading the chapter on sexuality please don't give up on the entire book, describes masturbation as a filthy habit to be discouraged. Easy for a WOMAN in her later life to say. all in all a good afternoon read but I'm glad I didn't buy it, I found it at my library."
1,Ugh,Terrible. Spanking with a switch? Don't give back rubs to children of the opposite gender? Blech.
3,A bit awkward,"My husband was not thrilled with this as it was difficult to assemble and is awkward to use. Really need two of this item, one for intake and one for outtake. We have a tight area for a workshop and this is really too long to be of much use unless he moves everything outside. Wish I had returned it as he has only used it once in almost a year."
3,It used to be 5 stars,"This used to be a great magazine industrial/metal/synth/goth (and free cd of your choice), but over the past year and a half it has turned into indy and Hot Topic teeny music."
3,"saw 3 lacks imagination,but still good","This Saw 3 is good but I could tell it was rushed.Why!When you are sitting on a gold mine why louse it up?!This time Jigsaw needs to have a tumor removed from his head and Amanda kidnaps a doctor to perform surgery on him.Meanwhile somewhere in the building a man bent on revenge is trying to find the man responsible for the death of his son by auto.There's a body frozen hanging from the ceiling.A man body being twisted like a pretzle and yes shooting.The second one was creative and the first was original and unique.This one is good but I can only hope this is the last one.The ending tells me so,but there's always room to sink lower."
4,Not as twisted,"After seeing this latest installement in the Saw series, I was abit disappointed. Yes it has the gore and the twist as the others....I just felt it was very rushed and predictable. I cant even begin to explain the plot(so much going on and everything connected), the only thing I will say is that if you had any questions about the first two they are all answered here. In the end, this is a definite see horror/thriller movie. It may leave you wanting more Jigsaw."
2,From cult movie into a display of sadism,"Even being just a little bit better than Saw 2, number 3 should be the end of the Saw series. Jigsaw's cruel games have now about reached their creativity limits. The deadly traps were the only reason to watch the second episode, but the story has now become too hard to believe.How have all these brilliant sadistic traps been constructed by a 70 year old guy and his small sized assistent Amanda? How the hell is such a couple capable in kidnapping grown men? Shame the great Saw movie has been turned from cult horror movie into a display of sadism. (SARR)"
2,Ending,"I first watched Saw III as the regular version on DVD..I recently watched it on the Directors Cut.Everything is the same until the ending.and the ending for SAW is always the most important.in the Regular version DVD or Saw III the ending was SWEET.in the directors cut the ending was Terrible.If you enjoy the SAW movies, make sure you do NOT get the Directors cut.It will ruin all of SAW III..ONLY get the Regular Version and maybe the Unrated, im ordering the Unrated now so i can see if it has the Good ending, or the crap ending.The rated version is the best so far.Its all about the endings in SAW.so Avoid the Directors Cut. It destroys the ending."
5,Game over,"A mistake corrected, and a distorted means are justified by the ends...thank you to the creators who were just as unhappy as I with leaving it at the end of saw 2."
1,Poor Quality OCR Scan,"This is a poor quality OCR (optical character recognition) scan, with many omissions and strange characters which make it unusable for academic work and citations. Even the casual reader has to be concerned that something important has been omitted, or the meaning distorted. This is a grave disservice to a book that had such tremendous impact on the thought of Martin Luther King, Jr."
5,Julian Is Still Da Man!,"Once again, this untouchable DJ spins out another winner. If you love Julian's style, energy and knack for pride music mixing, YOU'D BETTER BUY THIS CD! This will definitely be in my player for months & months. Thanks J!!"
4,definitely a circuit sound--hi-nrg stuff,"So many cover versions on this disc, one of Julian Marsh's specialties: Born to be Alive (Patrick Hernandez), Strangelove (Depeche Mode), White Flag (Dido), Love's Theme (Love Unlimited Orchestra), You Make Me Feel Brand New (Stylistics), Life in a Northern Town (Dream Academy), It's my LIfe (Talk Talk), and Jim Kerr covering his own Simple Minds hit Alive & Kicking. This track was a disappointment to me because it was a chillout track, and not a dance track like all the rest. tracks are all rather short, not many full length mixes:1. higher place (5:07)2. There is a place (5:42)3. love revolution (4:23)4. all this time (4:46)5. keep love together (5:03)6. born to be alive (4:06)7. strangelove (5:09)8. white flag (3:46)9. i imagine (4:27)10. love's theme (5:45)11. you make me feel brand new (4:07)12. life in a northern town (5:35)13. it's my life (4:27)14. alive & kickin (5:51)"
4,For the money...,"There really isn't anything better. Granted, Audiophiles will always find something lacking with budget goods, but again, for the money, you won't be disappointed. Good sound, sturdy build, all around a good product."
5,I love these!,"They sound great, and I haven't had any distortion with my mp3 player turned all the way up. The cord.is long and comes with an adapter for home stereo jacks. They're not too bulky considering the big sound they produce. Also they block out sound well so I love to have them on the bus or train."
4,Best headphones I have ever had,"Pros:Sennheiser is a quality brand, so no worries on that aspect.Excellent detail and treble.I found it very, very comfortable.Martha ""Cupcake"" Sofia loves them!Cancels outside noise to a certain extent.Comes with an adapter that you can use for guitar amps, playing guitar through headphones sounds great!Not much need to adjust volume constantly.Lookin' good.Cons:Hair will probably get caught on the headband if u insist on adjusting it every 3 seconds.Bass is not punchy enough for most. *There are better headphones if you pay more money. *Is not loud enough on normal mp3 players for some. *Bass problem is fixed with some equalizer tampering, and it does not get muddy.Volume was fine for me.I'm fine with the excellent quality I get for only 20 $.This gets a 4 simply because if you pay a alot of money you will, in turn, get better headphones. However, these are budget headphones that perform like the pros."
3,Good headphones for the price... but could be better...,"The HD201 is the entry level headphones from Sennheiser. Considering the price you pay, it is value for money. However, if you are able to pay more, get a higher end Sennheiser headphones. I have a HD205 and it goes without saying that the HD205 is better than the HD201.What I do like about the HD201 is that it is lightweight and it is comfortable and fits round the ears very well. The closed ear headphones also reduces some ambient noise. However, it is not a very ""loud"" headphone and when I turned to maximum volume on my player, I could hear a slight distortion.Below are the technical specifications:Acounstic principle: Dynamic, closedEar coupling: CircumauralFrequency response: 21-18,000 HzMax SPL at 1kHz, 1 Vrms: 108 dBTHD at 1kHz, 100 dB SPL: < 0.7%Impedance: 24 OhmsWeight (without cable): 165 gSignal cable: 3 m copper cable (OFC)Connector/adapter: 3.5 mm stereo jack with 6.3 mm adapter"
3,ok sound quality,not that great sound quality... dissappointed.low bass.. i guess thats what you get for this price.
3,OK product - hurts the ears when used longer,These doesnt cup the ear lobes well so they kind of start hurting over time.Its good sound quality and I got mine for pretty less ($10 bucks) which was a steal compared to those other branded ones.
4,Great Deal. Good for portable devices. Thin low end,"I have had good luck with Sennheiser headphones in the past so I went for this pair to use at work. The price is definetly right, an absolute bargain at $25. They sound fine and are efficent enough to be used with a portable device like an iPod or laptop, something which most full sized headphones have a problem with. The cable is unusually nice and doesn't tangle (magic?). The only complaint I could muster for this review is that the low frequencies aren't there in full, making bass dependent content sound weak ( like reggae). Its not that there is no bass, but that it sounds weak...I have a pair of Sennheiser 580s, which are big and expensive relative to these...bass is great on those but they sound awful plugged into anything but a dedicated headphone amp...Anyhow. I would recommend these for anyone who wants to replace their portable's stock headphones with clean, fullsized ones."
3,Ok for price but not spectacular,"I've had these headphones for a few hours now and frankly, I'm a bit dissapointed. As far as good headphones go - I have a pair of Technics that have much better bass response, better clarity and lower THD (hissing noise). The technics cost me approximately $37.At $17 - this pair of Sennheisers is a fair product but if you're looking for audiophile-level quality - you should avoid them."
4,Great!,"These are great for the price. Coming from under $10 earbuds these sound much better and even if you're not an audiophile you can appreciate it. Can't say how these compare, but to mee they're much better than I'm used to."
4,Great for the price point.,"I bought the Sennheiser HD201 headphones to replace a pair of Koss headphones from years ago. I'm not a high-end user (graduate student, not a DJ), but I appreciate clear highs and mids and deep lows. The HD201s aren't going to blow you away; they're clear with a decent amount of bass, but they're by no means a ""live"" experience. But for the price point, you really can't beat these. I'd buy them again."
3,"Not bad, but minimal noise cancelling","Unlike some other reviewers, I find these headphones to be loud enough. But, at the higher range, they crackle. They don't handle a lot of bass or full volume very well. They are a lot better than the earbud style headphones in terms of sound quality. In my opinion you don't need them to be as loud since they block out some of the noise around you. They're definitely a bargain for the price.However, I bought these for a flight and I was hoping they would block out noise even when not playing music so I could sleep. They do not block out much noise if you just wear them without music. Maybe they blocked out some of the soft noise, but I could still clearly hear the conversation of the people sitting next to me. I do not recommend them for this purpose. Of course, I was able to put on some music at a reasonable volume to block them out, but I don't sleep well with music playing. For my purposes - 3 stars."
5,Perfect for use while watching TV.,"I was looking for some new headphones to use while exercising and watching TV/movies at the same time. These headphones sound very good and were built fairly well, I dropped them once already and they didn't have a scratch on them. The cord could have been a little longer but I bought an extension for them which was cheap enough. Would buy these again."
3,"Decent sound, affordable and annoying.","I've had these head phones for a few months. I use them for general computer listening. They sound good, they were affordable for me, though the wire on these things is so damn long and it gets into everything. The wire is constantly wrapping around the bottom of my computer chair and getting tangled on things. I would prefer a shorter thicker, tougher cord. Overall they're not bad."
1,The worst headphones that I have ever owned.,"What a waste of my Pepsi points. These headphones are awful. They are way too big and the volume is too low. The cord is too long, good length for a 6""4' person.Don't buy them, you'll hate them."
2,Buen precio pero no muy buen sonido.,"El producto es excelente en cuanto a precio (ningún otro Sennheiser por ese costo), sin embargo, la calidad del sonido deja mucho que desear ya que los agudos son excesivos y los tonos más bajos apenas se pueden apreciar con calidad.Para aquellos que simplemente les interesan unos audífonos para oir música están muy bien pero para los que tienen un oído más refinado no los recomiendo, se sentirán descepcionados."
2,Low bass and treble Hi,i dont like this headset i have power full bass this headset dont have good bass sound is very soft anyway bass not good really not good and treble not mach to bass like a ssssssssssssssssssssmal
2,Only some optical mouses work on this,"My microsoft optical comfort mouse 3000 does not track at all on this, while I thought it could track on just about any surface. However, I also have a logitech mouse for my laptop and it seems to work fine. I guess if you buy this, you will have to cross your fingers and hope that the mouse pad will work. Apart from this, I like the texture and the materials, and the pad is comfortable. However, the two sides enclosing the gel are glued and not stitched together, so I'm not sure how long this will last."
4,"Good Sound, Unbeatable Price","These headphones sound great. Have listened to everything from dubstep to country and each genre sounds good. Bass could be better and volume is a little bit lacking but what more can you ask for out of a $20 pair of headphones? Either way, these are a great buy and will serve anybody well for home/school use."
2,Not as good as it appears,"Based on the reviews, I expected these headphones to have a superb sound quality. Well, found out they sound almost like ordinary headphones (perhaps only slightly better) but are built as stereo headphones. I'm comparing these to the ""Sony MDR-V150"" stereo headphones I previously had which were excellent and around the same price as these. Don't expect these to be superior quality stereo headphones, or you'll be bummed when you test them out. Perhaps I expected too much, but all the beats sounded flat as they do on regular headphones."
3,Don't buy if you have a big head,"If you have a big head, the headphones press against your head too hard. It's only comfortable for about 10 minutes before you notice. Sound is fine, but I wont ever use them because they are too uncomfortable."
4,"good gear, good price","Doesn't really need quite that long a cord. I bought these headphones to use with Sansa Clip+ so imagine having more cord looped in velcro than the size of the the player :DSound is exceptional for the price.Build quality is a bit lacking, but that's because you're paying a low price.Did I mention sound quality? It's great!"
4,Sennheiser HD201,"Very good product, light weight, the sound quality is very deep, good isolationi only use for editing because of that i think the cable is too long."
2,Its OK but Not LOUD,"This product its OK but Not Loud, i was looking something Loud but cheap, for the price is OK, good quality."
3,"Nice, but not sound-proof","Some things to note about the Sennheisder HD201: The cord is ridiculously long, which is great if you're watching TV and need to keep the sound to your ears only. The headphones do not block outside sound, and it leaks sound too. These are not noise-blocking headphones, at all. I had read reviews saying that they block sound, so I bought these, but were surprised because they didn't block sound even when music was playing.The design is nice though. The ear cans adjust and they're pretty comfortable."
2,Sennheiser HD 201,"I give two stars only because of design and lightweight.In regarding the sound quality, then to me there are no sound quality whatsoever.Maybe my Headphones are broken, but there are medium sound volume even if you Max it.Sad, I bought it because of the brand name.But there are no magic you get what you pay.What I cannot understand is, why company with Name, manufacturing these low quality product?"
3,They work,"I've used a bunch of different Sennheiser products over the years and the quality sort of falls short of typical Sennheiser pairs, but then again, the typical Sennheiser pair isn't as reasonably priced as these are.Yes, for the price, they are a decent pair of headphones, they fit my ears nicely and they are fairly comfortable to wear over a period of time.Sure, the bass is a bit lacking, and the sound seems kind of monotone once and a while, but Sennheiser or not, you can't really expect the world if you are only going to invest so much."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"Product just received and I was almost afraid to try them, given what they cost. I bought these to replace a $299 Bose so-called noise reduction pair which had literally fallen apart- the ear cups split and run and the left ear just completely broke off- and no, I don't have a big head. . Man was I shocked when I tried them. I don't get the above comments about weak bass- they have all the bass my ears will handle. The trebles are so much sharper than the Bose and I can only put the volume at mid level (I'm using an Ipod.)- I turned the Bose wide open and could not achieve a decent volume level. I just buried them (Bose phones) in my back yard. I'll never pay that much for head phones again."
4,Does what it's suppose to and looks cool!,"I got these for my project studio at home. The sound is awesome, and I can wear them for hours without it hurting. I liked them enough that when my sister ran over them with a computer chair, I bought a second pair."
5,Outstanding quality from an OLDschool guy's perspective!,"What more is there to say. I just unpacked my phones and right now I'm jamming to Stairway to Heaven and It's the best Ive ever heard it. Im a very thrifty person so I will NEVER spend more than what these cost me so this a great bang for your buck if you havn't bought higher quality phones in the past. Oh yeah, and most importantly to me, they don't hurt like hell like those flippin earbuds!!!"
4,Excellent Value,"These headphones sound good, but not as good as my in-ear Shure e2c's or even my apple in-ear headphones, but these Sennheiser's were a fraction of the price and sound almost as good.All in all, these are not the best headphones but are an excellent value at the price paid ($10)."
5,Cheap and high quality,"At this price you can't get anything better. It fits comfortably over your head and the sound is a lot better than the default mp3 earphones. 10 ft. cord allows you to use it anywhere in your room but subtracts from mobility. Pretty good overall, I'd say it better than my AKG headphones for the comfort factor. Blocks out about half the noise you normally hear in the environment."
3,"Muffled bass and flat response, cheap only worth $10.00","I had high hopes for these headphones. But, the bass is muffled and the sound is flat. Not much separation. I may be spoiled with the Vmoda's and Bose headphones that I have.But, I cannot recommend these headphones, unless you are needing something for speech, Makes music sound like an am radio.But, for $13.99, it may find use somewhere, like for kids under 12. Me, I am sending back even though they were $14.99."
3,"Just ""ok"" but not quite good enough for a bass head.","Not a bad pair, high's seem ok. Bass is weak though. I would highly recommend anyone wanting a pair in this price range to wait for the JVC HARX700's to go on a sale. I think the highs are cleaner on that pair, and the bass is just perfect for things like movie soundtracks and melodic rock. Does a very good job on most techno albums too.These 201's however can't really push enough bass to do soundtracks justice imo.Keep in mind, at normal retail the 700's are double the price, so it's not like these are usually competing in the same bracket. BUT you can totally get the 700's during a sale for near the same price, so it's worth the wait! Unlike me.. -_-"
5,Awesome Headphones!,"Extremely inexpensive, yet amazing headphones. There is such a small difference between these $20 headphones than my $200 dollar ones. Every studio needs at least... three or four of these."
5,Great quality for the price,I love the sound and quality of the headphones. Unlikely to find anything comparable for the price. My only complaint is that the cord is about three times longer than needed.
3,Just ok,"Decent quality sound. Like with most of these headphones, my ears get very warm after wearing them for over an hour. The most frustrating thing about these headphones is the ridiculous length of the cord you use to plug them in. I'm not sure why I would ever need a 5 ft cord for my headphones. I use them at work, and always get the cord tied up in my chair, etc. It's a pain. Would recommend if you are OK with a long, annoying cord."
2,Not much luck with these,I'm on my 2nd pair of these. One of the sides went out after a few months just like it did on the 1st pair. Not even worth sending back to get a 3rd pair when i know they will just blow out after a month or so... The cheap-o RCA $5 headphones i bought at the dollar store have held out longer!
1,Not impressed,"I own a pair of HD-202 for work and i was thoroughly impressed with it, so I thought I would try the much cheaper HD-201 a try for my own home use. When I opened the box and held it in my hands, I knew I was not going to be impressed with this product. It just feels cheap. The headset doesn't really close right over my ears so it feels akward, and the sound quality is mediocre at best.Oh, and the responding frequency reported on this site is false. It is not 18-22khz. If you look on the Sennheiser website, it's actually 21-18khz. I returned mine and am hoping to get a full refund due to the wrong information put up on the webpage.Conclusion: get the HD-202 instead."
4,Great great for the price,"Great value - won't blow you away, but no problems with audio quality. I mostly use it to listen to music on my smartphone - since my smartphone has no bass and very sharp, ear-hurting treble - and it sounds good enough for that."
4,Great for the price...,"Good quality headphones for the money...I ride a zero-turn mower with them on and they do quite well. Even though they are not noise cancelling, they get the job done."
4,Good Deal For Price,"Having picked this product up for approximately twenty USD, I feel I got my money's worth! They're truly flat in terms of equilization, which is something I like out of headphones. If you want something almost as cheap from Sennheiser, and you're some idiot who needs ALL THE BASS FISH, then get the HD202s. These work for just about everyone else, and you will not be disappointed. Took a couple hours of usage to break them in, and I'm enjoying them up. Rating 4/5 stars because you can't truly LOVE materialistic items unless you're high."
4,Worthy product in this price range.,You can enjoy the low-level bass music in this. Worth buying for $18. I will recommend this headphone in this price range. Very lengthy wire for laptop use.
5,Great for the price!,"I simply cannot believe how cheap these suckers are.I would easily throw down another 20 for another pair of these. I've had them since September, and I've yet to experience any problem with them. Volume is a little low, but I don't blast it anyways so its cool by me."
4,"Great value, poor construction","These things sound *amazing* for being $25 headphones. My only complaint is the plastic headband -- it broke in the first few months I had a pair. Were the headband made of something sturdier, I'd never look further than this model; however, as it is, I'd have to recommend looking for an alternate model with sturdier construction."
3,Good value for price!,This product produces a very good sound and provides some isolation from outside noises. It is very comfortable to wear as well.
4,Good choice for the money,"I have used this for a long time. I am sure many people gave the technical details about it, and compared to other headphones. So, I guess there is no need for extra info.For me, this is an acceptable quality headphone. I do not use it for listening to music, as I have better ones to use for that purpose. But, if you are looking for something with decent sound quality (keep the sound simple, in other words), light, not pressuring your head, and having closed features (meaning passively reducing the outside noise), then you won't go wrong with this one. Additionally, it is a great headphone to use with the TV, even for an extended period of time..."
5,very good,"These head phones are amazing.When i got these head phones there was nothing wrong with them (until my friend sat on them.I got them fixed with epoxy and duct tape.Pros:very comfortable,good sound quality ,loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong cord.!!!!!!!!!great pricecons: break when sat upon,cord is a little too long"
3,missing adapter,Everything on the headphone is ok except ...On the box it says there is a 6.3mm adapter enclosed but I could not find it ... in neither of the two I bought.
2,hugely disappointed,"always 've been sennheiser fan, but it was never cheap, but i was ok with that, as for a good quality u need to pay. when i discovered HD201 on amazon i thought that price must be a mistake, but then i realized its for real. so i thought i'll give it a try, although i was pretty sure for that small amount of money i wont be able to get anything good and it turned out i was right. sound quality is more or less ok, somewhere bit below average, but real problem is a level of sound, no matter what u do it will stay low and when i say low i mean it (tried even few amplifiers)so title of my review is ""hugely disappointed"" and that not because i spent my money for nothing (as i already wrote i did not expect really something from this headphones) but because company like sennheiser (that i really like since many years) should not release crap like this!"
2,Dud,"I bought these mainly because of Sennheiser big name in the headphone industry. They were terrible. Sound quality was abismal, and sounded very very hollow. No highs, lows, or mids for that fact. There was no comfort at all, and I was very dissapointed with the headphones. The only positive was the length of the cord. It was massive! However, overall I can't recommend the product. It may have just been the set I got, but I didn't get another one to find out."
3,Decent and it serves the purpose,"I bought this to listen to music at work and keep office hustle bustle sounds to the minimum. The sound quality is decent and is not classy. But I am satisfied with the performance. If one wears for more than an hour or two, the earlobes hurt.I think this is an affordable good choice for general purpose use at work or home. Not a very portable one!"
5,Excellent,"Very satisfied with this purchase. The sound quality was as anticipated and more, the speed of delivery unexpected considering the deployed located where I am... thank you for everything."
5,Great sound and comfort,"First off these are not for bass heads, but for those that enjoy the music the way it should be heard.They are very lightweight and comfortable allowing for Hrs of use without having headaches and dizzy spells.BTW if you have a large head and/or ears then you really should pick these up."
3,Best quality but extremely low volume,"Quality is the best, cord is very good and durable. One biggest sad thing is that it has very low volume. When plugged in into my iPod on maximum volume, I can't hear anything except car sounds and people talking outside, even if I listen to Metal music. Bought about a month ago and price was $17, now it's $23 and I DO NOT recommend buying this headphones if you want to use it outdoors."
3,These Headphones will haunt me for the rest of my life!!!,"By far the best set of headphones I've ever had the pleasure of putting my ears in. They are extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, and I found myself hearing little subtitles in songs I had never heard before. Not to mention they feel extremely durable. So why only 3 stars you ask?? Cause the only downside to these headphones was a deal breaker, that being the volume. These headphones are not loud at all, and since I was primarily using them for my computer it was a no go. I kept them for a week debating on living with it but in the end I returned them. With that being said if your using them with something that has a high volume output, then these are the headphones for you."
3,it's okay,The price was right and they do what is needed of them what more can be said. Why is there a limit on what I have to say?
1,Sadly disappointed,"Previous reviewers said that these had great sound. I expected more of a noise cancelling effect which these, sadly, do not have. Plain and simple, I can't watch a movie on my Kindle Fire on airplanes because of the ambient noise and these do nothing to increase either the volume, or cancel outside noise. Other than that, I am no expert about other uses. Shipping was fast, and no problems with the awesome Amazon refund policy."
3,Bad for in-flight entertainment,"I bought these headphones thinking that they would be useful for air travel since they are of decent quality and cover the ear. The fact is that these headphones don't get loud enough for use on a plane. Not even close.You know how there are some volume settings on your headphones that are way too loud when you are in a quiet place? These headphones lack that level of volume. You can turn them all the way up with no discomfort. This is a problem when you are trying to drown out outside noise. Yeah, they are not advertised as noise-cancelling headphones, but my $9 Phillips earclip headphones get at least twice as loud.With that being said, the sound quality is good. There is rich bass and only a bit of tinniness, but again, none of this matters unless you are in a quiet place."
4,I'd rather dig my eyes out! I had to embrace the long cord!,"I have had these for about a year now. The sound quality is acceptable. Not the best, but I did not get these for Hi-Fi listening. I got these for the lightweight build and the long cord. I use these for TV viewing. I work an odd shift so I was unable to watch TV really loud or anything that had explosions because it would wake up my wife. So I had to either get headphones or watch Eat,Pray, Love type movies and I'd rather dig my eyes out. So I got these and they were the perfect solution to watching masterpieces like Terminator and Flash Gordon. The cord is long enough to reach my couch and the sound quality is great for movies.Very Pleased"
5,WOW I have missed out for a long time!!,"I have always just listened to the ""ear buds"" or head phones that came with the device I had bought, not any more. These give a much better sound than I had expected. I will use them for a ton of my around the house chores as well as while at work. I used them while cutting wood and the roar of a chainsaw was but a little hum while listening to my Ipod. Very nice purchase considering I used my Pesistuff points. I would recomend them to anyone who can't afford the higher priced head phones. GREAT DEAL for the bucks!!"
4,Best @ 20,"Im not an expert, but for 20 bucks these are as good as they get.Bad:Can lack power, but when you decide to pump power into them they tend to max out pretty fast.Pros:20 friggin bucks.Sound awesome.You have 20 dollars? Want nice headphones? Buy these. Got more cash? Look elsewhere."
4,What a deal!!,"These headphones are very light weight, comfortable and sturdy. They have really good sound and were surprisingly affordable in price. My family and I are very happy thus far with our new headphone purchase."
5,Can't Beat for the Price,"Between 12 and 15 dollars, you won't find headphones that can beat these for the price.While the quality won't cut it for audiophiles, I would recommend these to anyone looking for just general headphones that they can wear to tune out their roommates while listening to music or watching a movie.While they are extremely light and comfortable (composed of durable plastic) with a decent sound isolation (NOT noise - cancellation), I would not recommend these as travel headphones as they are a bit bulky. They do, however, come with a decently long cord.As a college student on a tight budget, these were a great buy."
5,Good sound and comfortable in office,"I use these in my office at work. Have worn them all day, and found them comfortable with good sound quality."
3,pretty decent sound; missing adapter,"Pros: decent sound reproduction and ambient noise reduction in a lightweight productCons: sound is a tad brittle' leatherette ear cushions thin enough that the part of my ear farthest from my head touches the hard plastic inside speaker cover; no 6.3mm stereo adapter shipped with the product, which it was supposed to have.Overall: for the price, I guess they'll do, because they're so lightweight. But for a few dollars more, I'd probably rather have the Sony MDR-XD200."
3,"Functional, nothing exceptional","These aren't noise cancelling headphones, but you can drown out the sound around you by turning up your own music.For less than thirty bucks, these do what they promise, sit on your head and make sound, nothing out of this world.They do get a little uncomfortable around the ears after more than 3 hours of listening though, as the fabric isn't cloth but some leather like material.Good for the price, but audiophiles or those who need a noise canceling option should shell out more cash."
5,FOR ALL THOSE WONDERING: HD201 VS. HD202,I have now been the owner of both the HD201s and HD202s.I tried to research as much as I could but I would never get a straight answer anywhere.Well I am going to change that.Plain and simple: the HD201s are greater than the HD202s.The level of comfort and sound quality in the 201s outdo the sound quality and lack of comfort in the 202s.Not to mention the 201's are cheaper.The 201s are easily built tougher.It is official the 201s are better. Message me if you have any questions.
2,Ouch! And why does the sound keep cutting out?,"Sound is only okay--when it doesn't cut out. This seems to happen whenever the wearer breathes too deeply or turns his head at all. And they hurt! My son wears glasses, so they hurt even worse. Msybe Sennheiser's more pricey headphones are good, but no luck at all with anything under $50. We returned these, kept on looking, and found super-comfortable, excellently crafted, beautifully designed, great-sounding headphones for just a little more--from Koss!"
4,Excellent product for the value,"Great sound. Only issue is that after a while my ears got warm. However, for 10 bucks, a fantastic bargain."
3,OK,"This aren't very special headphones, but they get the job done. They aren't very loud and they ""leak"" (people who don't have the headphones on can hear your music) more than I like. I usually only where them when I'm at home and I don't feel like blasting my musc because my roommates hate my taste of music....(lol). Its an ""OK"" buy-"
3,Just OK,"Because of the high ratings people were giving, I had my eye on these headphones for a about a month. When they went on sale for $9.99 I bought them. I'm not so thrilled with them like others seem to be. It really doesn't cancel outside noises very well and the sound, I think, is poor. Right before I bought these, I was at Radio Shack where they had some noise cancelling headphones on sale for half price, I paid $15.00 and like them much better than these. They are pretty comfortable and for $9.99 aren't bad."
3,Where's the low end??,"There is a nice clarity to these and yes, they're dirt cheap, but I've had other dirt cheap phones with much better bass. The utter lack of low end on these phones is disheartening, my last pair were 17 dollar Maxells - of all things - from Staples, and I miss them already."
3,"Good Quality, but low volume","The headphones are simple but good, however to use in my guitar amp I have to put volume close to MAX, and when I unplug the phones I have to remember to put volume down."
5,Good item,"That item is very good, easy to use and simpleI chose this item because, it's very simple.Nobody showed to me this item, but did it by myself.Thanks...."
5,Awesome for the price,"Great sound from a cheap pair. The only place you see that you miss out is the cup size ( a bit shallow, and may become uncomfortable after an extended period) and the speaker size is a bit on the small size. but for $22 or whatever a paid. it has been one of the best purchases i have made this year."
2,"Tinny sound, better options available.","For around the same price, I recommend Plantronics, as the sound is much fuller and more immersive. These feel and sound like a cheap pair of headphones, and *even for the price* are not a good option."
4,Good Sound Low Price,"Great sound and low price, This Headphones sounds beautiful without distortion or Loudness, bass is good, It only lack of a little volume"
4,Does the job,"Bought these for my grandfather to used when he's on the computer. He like using them, and they help him hear better."
5,SOUND ON,Excellent sound qualities. Better than the more expensive models from other name brands. My son has his own recording studio----this headphone set has best acuity with no background noise.
4,Nice Bargain,"For the price you pay for these headphones, it's quite the bargain. Sound is better than I expected for the price you pay."
5,Great Sound,Gave this as a gift to my son. I bought because of the long cord feature and they are very comfortable with a good sound.
3,Got the job done,"It was a little larger and bulkier than expected, but altogether, a good purchase. My only serious complaint would be the swiveling of the ear muffs. The connection of the headband to the muff was designed to allow some swivel for personal comfort, but ended up being more annoying and ill- fitting."
4,Really good value and fits my freakish head just fine,"Others have commented on the audio quality, and suffice it to say that I agree - the audio quality is good. It's great for the price, but don't kid yourself that these will sound like high-end Sennheiser headphones.I just want to add that they are comfortable for folks with large heads. I wear a pretty large hat size (for example, I rarely find a baseball cap that fits my head), and these accommodate me easily - there's still a click left that I could expand them. The ear cups also have swiveling mounts that allow enough play to keep the cups evenly pressed against your head.I honestly can't think of a better pair of headphones you can get for this price."
4,The cord is too long,The cord is way too long. I was expecting a normal length like ipod headphones. This cord is easily over 5 feet long. It is not pratical for use outside the home.
2,so-so,"I had expected great things from these, considering the quality of the 201s. I couldn't wear these more than a few minutes without much ear discomfort. The ear piece didn't even cover the entire ear.The sound quality was about the same as cheap ear pods."
5,Wonderful,"I can't find fault with them. They sound good and are comfortable. They block a lot of sound, which can be a bad thing (I can't hear computer audio when listening to iPod).I think these sound amazing, but my reference point is iPod headphones, so meh."
2,Anyone seeking comfort need not apply,"Big, clunky, highly uncomfortable headphones. Better luck with Sony."
2,uncomfortable to wear,"dont buy this, its very uncomfortable to wear as all other headphones in this price range. The sound is not bad but not amazing. Get a Bose head its way more comfortable."
2,Ridiculous cord,"The headphones themselves are great. Sound quality is excellent and they are very comfortable. My main problem is that it that the cord attached is 10 feet long... way longer than needed for walking around listening to your music in the street. Unless you like carrying a huge bundle of extra cord in your pockets, this isn't very practical. I'm sure it would be convenient if you wanted to connect it to your TV and watch from your couch or something like that. But then why not keep the cord at a sensible length and sell a separate extension for times you need more cord. It may seem silly to quibble over that, but to me it's really annoying."
2,WEAK!,"I am really disappointed! I realize that these headphones are not intended to be audiophile quality being in the $20-30 range, but even at that price they disappoint: cheap construction materials, not loud AT ALL, 9-ft of thin cord (way too long) and absolutely NO BASS - my $7 Altec-Lansing earbuds have twice the range and volume of these over-ear headphones...save your money and spend a little extra on a better quality product."
4,"Long cord, decent sound","The length of the cord seems just right. It's not too long or too short.The sound produced is probably average quality; it's probably not for crazy audiophiles but they are good work headphones.There isn't a ludicrous amount of cushioning on the inside, so your ears may hurt after several hours. Still, it's above average and definitely better than earbuds.The headset is light and relatively sturdy. It doesn't kill all outside noise but it does the right amount for a work environment."
2,Very breakable,"I got three of these headphones and they all broken, my Sennheiser HD 280 PRO is still alive but I had to change the ear pads and head pad foams, this replacement makes my Sennheiser HD 280 PRO feel like NEW after 3 years of use. I think cheap Sennheiser products are nonsense. This one is very bad. very very bad. I still have my Akg k44 in good working condition after 7 years of abusive use in my studio (you know how artist love to sit on headphone but still pay the bills)."
2,"Don't buy it, waste of money","It's nothing to do with ""Noise canceling"" at all. It does not isolate your ear, although it covers it..Sound quality is ok, but the overall material quality is low. I don't recommend it as a ""Noise canceling headphone""."
2,Big and bulky,"Big, bulky, ugly, and not great sound.If you are looking for a cheap set of headphones I suppose these work. But the sound is mediocre at best with no deep bass sound that I like.Certainly not for the fashion conscious lol. Does have a long cord if you need it.So, cheap and adequate. But I would not buy them again."
1,Are Pepsi and Amazon screwing us????????,Ordered through Pepsi Stuff promotion. The headphones arrived defective/damaged. One side wire was broken. Guess what? No returns or exchanges on Pepsi Stuff prizes. Seems like this is a scam to give away damaged merchandise. I read the Pepsi t-shirt reviews and apparently they suck. way too small.
1,It sucks,"terrible sound quality and breaks to easy barely, lasted a day. worst headphones anyone can ever get"
2,"honestly, not very good sound","I bought and compared Sennheiser HD201 ($20 at Amazon) vs Panasonic RP-HT360 ($24 at Amazon).I concluded that the Sennheiser was far inferior. The bass was okay, treble was good, but the midrange vocals sounded very nasal and tinny. I think this is due to the completely closed design of the ear cups, which make it sound like a tin can. The Panasonic has some holes to allow some natural resonation. If you want good-sounding closed design, you will have to spend much more money.Although this was not in the specs, I estimate the driver to be 30mm upon visual inspection.Pros:Ear cups have 2 axis of freedomFoam padding on headbandCons:Sound is nasally and tinny. Can get better sound at same price.Ear cups are too shallow, ears will touch."
4,Success!,"My nephew loves these and they didn't cost a fortune. Of course they are not Bose noise reducing headphones however they are almost as good. My nephew doesn't care for the small ear buds, I don't blame him, so I purchased these and he finds that they really are comfortable. I tried them on and I have to agree. I highly recommend these for anyone looking for a replacement to those horrible ear buds that are offered."
3,Nice general purpose cans,"I already had HD485 and HD595, so I won,t put HD201 in the comparison area with them whith the far price point of HD201. Anyway, some good advantages are found in HD201:1. very light2. adequate length of the wire3. nice design of the bodywell, there is aslo disadvantages in HD201:1. less comfort for long time2. the light bass need to be tweaked well from source3. less frequecy range of highsThis cans are not suited for high quality sources due to limited frequecy range. But these cans satisfy any normal user."
4,Great headphone,"This is a closed-ear headphone. You can enjoy your music without noise. It is light and comfortable. The sound is really great for the low-end headphone. The more important thing is that the price is really cheap. I have three headphones. Now, I wear this one all the time when I need to listen music privately. No regret to buy it. Try it, you will love it."
2,Get the HD 202,I have the HD 202s which I have enjoyed but found the ear pieces to be slightly too narrow so when I needed a new pair to keep at home (202s are work headphones) I picked up a pair of 201s.I work in pro audio so I felt the need to compare the 201s to the 202s.202 wins by a mile.The HD 201s are comfortable and sound clean enough but they have no bottom end. The HD202 have a much fuller sound with clear highs and rich deep notes. The 201s sound flat. I am going to send them back and order 202s. For about the same price you really get a much bette pair of headphones.
2,HD201 Sucks!!!,"Look this product is a Waste of money, the set felt good on my ears but The Sound Quality was very Poor."
3,Died on Me after about 1 month!,"They are nice and comfortable, but they died on me after about a month and now I am in dire need on new headphones. Thanks a lot!"
4,Nice Cheap Alternative Headphones,"These headphones are definitely worth the price. You won't see a $20 headphone with this quality. These have a cheap plastic quality built, but tough and strong plastic that is durable. If you are a hip-hop and rap listener like me who would put the bass to full blast, these aren't that good for bass quality. You can hear some bass but not much. The cups fit perfectly and it is large enough to go around the ear so sound doesn't leak much. Also they keep away some outer noise. One thing I dislike the most if the sponge pads. I have used these for a month and the pads are half way pressed down so it does give me pain on the ear when in use. The second thing I dislike is the cord. The cord is like 5ft. long so that is something that becomes very annoying. Overall at the price of $20, these are the best out there."
4,Good bang for your buck.,"This is my second pair of Sennheiser's. The first one lasted a few years before the cord started getting loose and I lost use of one side. I'm actually wearing them right now as I sit at my computer all day working and these are my daily headphones. They are suprisingly comfortable for my large head and don't make my ears hurt which is the first thing I worry about. The chord is plenty long and the sound quality if probably better than what you pay for here. The bass response is good, but probably they could use a little better clarity.For comparison, I have a Razer gaming headset on my PC which is only slightly better but costs 2-3x more. I also like these because they drowned out other noise because they cover your ear and are not open air."
4,Great product for such a small amount of monies!,"Really impressed how good these are for the price! Puts my other cans to shame :(I didn't realise how long the cable was but thats my fault, not Amazons. Really good product all round though. Great sound for the price! Recommend to anyone else"
5,Great for work.,"I get these to replace the Sony MDR-V150 headphones I was using at work (they were getting horribly uncomfortable.) Wow! What a difference!Given their size, they are much lighter than I would have expected. I have worn them for four or five hours at a time with no discomfort.Despite their weight, they feel pretty solid to me (other than the cable, it feels a bit thin.)I can't complain about sound quality, either. Some people say they are too quiet, but I haven't had a problem using them at my desk at work.All in all, I would say well worh the money."
5,Don't judge a pair of headphones by it's price...,"...if you do, however, you're gonna be in for a pleasant surprise. I'm only 2 hours deep with these cans and I can already say it's probably the best $20 I've spent. Solid construction, good, clean look, and they fit nice and comfortably. I'm no audiophile, but these phones are CONSISTENT. Highs, mids, and bass are all crisp, clean, and detailed. Everything images together very well, and no frequency range seems out of place or over-accented. Overall I'm very impressed. If they were $100 cans I'd still have nothing but good things to say. The fact they're only $20 is just incredible. Do yourself a favor and pick a pair up."
2,"Cheap, leaky headphones","The sound quality was not very good--my $2 earbuds do a better job with the bass. Also, you have to turn the volume up very high on your device to get a reasonable volume through the headphones. When you do this, everyone in the room can hear what you're listening too at a slightly lower volume, so students, this is definitely not something you'll want to use in the library! I was not satisfied and returned the product promptly."
5,Great sound for this price,Price is very good & sound is very clear . very useful during travel and work.This is worth for your money.
2,Unfortunately not nearly as good as my $4.99 Coby headphones,"I'm disappointed in these headphones, they are neither lightweight nor as good as my cheap drugstore Coby headphones. I have been switching back and forth and am not satisfied with this purchase. I'll keep them because it's too much trouble to return them and we need an extra set around the house but I'll stick with my Coby headphones and know better next time."
3,Nice headphones,"After much deliberation between the 201 and the 202's, I could not decide and bought them both. They are very different that I can tell you. The 202's fit tighter and are much louder. I could just rope with the cord, I do not like that it has to be so long. The 201's are much clear and are much better quality I believe. Three of us in my house tested out both and all of us had the same opinion.I figure for 20 bucks each, what is there to complain about. In the end, I am keeping the 202's for my Ipad, and the 201's are on their way to a soldier in Texas who needs them for school.so the end result is:If you want louder get the 202If you want clear sounds, the 201's are the best bet for the money."
2,Ehhh!!!!!!!!!!,"It has less bass than expected, mids and highs are good though. Good for watching movies on your laptop computer"
3,It's ok,I Love the long cord. I'm not impressed with stereo sound on high notes. Fit on head and over ears is only ok.
5,Great product!,"I have been using these for well over a year at least three days of each week. They are comfortable, sound great, shut out outside noise extremely well and the cable is detachable which prevents the wiring from being damaged when tugged on. Highly suggested product."
4,Cord is too long and poor quality,"Inexpensive, and good sound quality, but cord is too long and the cord quality is subpar. If it was a coiled cord, I would have no complaints."
4,Pretty good for the price.,"I bought these to keep from talking to my neighbors. I walk the dog 6 days a week for exercise. I found if I walked during the day every annoying ass neighbor for 6 miles wants to talk to me. So, I bought these and listen to music while I walk. The noise isolation isn't extreme because I can still hear cars coming and my idiot neighbors calling my name. The cord is wicked long it's almost annoying. I got no cable wrap in the box like some other guy on here. They are big and stretch over my big melon head to completely cover my ears. Luckily they look huge so my neighbors can see I have them on and they don't think I'm ignoring them. They weigh nothing some idiots probably think that means they are cheaply made. They are quite well constructed. Get a pair you won't regret it."
4,Sennheiser HD201,"Bought these to use when doing homework to block out background noise from the house. While quarantining myself in a closet would give me the quiet that I should have when studying, I fear leaving the kids unattended. With these headphones I get enough quiet to focus, but not so much that I can't hear the random, inevitable scream from the kids' room. I recommend these for anyone who wants noise almost canceled.Also, the L & R could have been more pronounced. They are very hard to see and though raised, too small to tell which is which. I used a Sharpie to mark left and right more prominently."
3,ok,"the most average pair of headphones ever. sound is ok, very little bass but very comfortable. you get what you pay for."
4,Excellent quality at the right price!,Bought these for $15 on sale and they are worth every penny and then some!ProsGreat sound qualityComfortableCHEAP!Their Sennheiser's!ConsPerhaps a bit fragile (wouldn't risk throwing them around)A little TO awesome for their own good
3,A Good Value For What's Charged,"These were a good value for the price. They performed well when I used them in a couple of different devices ranging from a stereo receiver to a CD player and including digital players in between, so I can say that they've been pretty thoroughly tested with a lot of different gear. The audio fidelity could use a little sharpness, though. Otherwise I wouldn't return them."
4,Great Headphones,"I was looking for a decent set of headphones for not a lot of money. I'm not an audiophile, but I do use headphones at work. They're comfortable to wear, and sound great to my untrained ear."
5,You get what you pay for,"I use these everyday at work. Good sound and comfortable. For those ""Audiophiles"" writing crazy point by point reviews, what do you expect from headphones < $20??? For normal daily use they work great."
4,"Sennheiser HD201 For PC Music, Gaming","took 1 point off the rating since the product is cheaper made than I expected, looks like it might break in a few months from experience but for the price it's not that bad i guessI will update in a few months if anything changes/break etc ..."
2,Do not recommend,"These headphones are terrible. The cable for the headphone jack is about 6 feet long, the sound quality is absolutely terrible, and the they are extremely uncomfortable. The only reason why I give it two stars rather than one is for the catchy design. That's it. So save your money and look elsewhere."
5,"Light, comfortable, good quality headphones","Just got these pair of headphones for my office, based on my husband's recommendations. These are light, comfortable and very good quality, suitable for long duration use.One of the problems I have faced with some other headphones:1. Too big to fit on my head and keep dangling.2. Start hurting my head or ears after some time.3. Audio quality sucks.These have a snug fit for heads of any size and do not hurt or irritate at all.Love them."
1,"Uncomfortable, hurts my ears","after 2 hours of wearing these bad boys, my ears are tender and erythematous. The sound quality is fabulous, but the physical discomfort is a pain.Perhaps I just need to get used to them, or ""break 'em in"" or something like that.Correction 1/1/07: now that I have gotten used to them, they are great. no longer hurts my ears even one bit. great cans; highly recommended. The nice frequency response range is great for hearing the ever-so-tough systolic click murmur of mitral valve prolapse."
3,The 202 is Much Better...,"I picked up a Sennheiser HD201 on sale. It's perfectly fine for what it does, but there's a WORLD of difference between it and the sound quality of Sennheiser's next ""budget"" headphone, the HD202. The 202's sound is far superior, louder and with a more pronounced bass. I have no problem keeping my 201's as a back up or if I'm traveling around, but the 202 is well worth the upgrade and it's only a little bit more money."
4,Good inexpensive Headset,"I bought this headset because I have been so happy with the Sennheiser PX100 I bought for my Player .The sound from the HD201 headphones is not as good as the PX100,s but the price is very reasonable. all in all a good buy."
2,Fragile,These are very light weight and fragile. They broke after only 1 week of owning them. I just replaced them with Audio-Technica ATH-M30 headphones which are still relatively cheap but infinitely better.
3,NOT FOR USE AS NOISE REDUCTION,I have them on right now and I can hear the television in the next room. So far my ears are starting to sweat and I am wondering how long I can keep them on. Not hurting but I wouldnt say they are comfortable either.
1,Cord way to long,"Seriously! This cord can be used as a belt and still go to your feet, way to long and gets tangled so easily. That ruins the headphones. In terms of sound quality is great though."
4,"Awseome, but...","Great headphones, the only issue I have with them is how long the cord is--it's not really practical for every day use."
3,Sennheiser HD201 Headphones,"They are great headphone, i would just like the cable to bew a little thicker, and they got to me exactly the day it said they were going to come"
4,head phones,"excellent product for my elderly father, but the cord is not long enough to each from tv to his chair"
3,Not pleased with the sound,"I purchased these as a replacement for my Koss KTXPRO1 phones. I was looking for a sealed set that would do a better job of blocking out noise at the office. I use a Creative Zen Stone with no equalizer feature so I'm pretty much stuck with the sound the headphones/player offer.To me, the HD201 lacked the bass of the Koss model. I wasn't looking for a rumbling desk, just enough bass to be noticeable for contrast. The sound was also quiet, tinny, lacking depth, almost distant. After reading all the raves about the low-end Sennheisers I was disappointed.Of course sound quality is very much up to personal preference. If I were using another MP3 player with adjustable EQ I may have been happier."
1,Terrible Sound Quality,"I've had many pairs of headphones in my life, from expensive to the cheapest I could find but I don't think any of them sounded as bad as these do. There is almost no bass response and highs sound tinny and cheap. I am sending them back, which because I don't like them amazon says it is not their fault so they are charging me $5.50 for the return. And to add insult to injury, I see now that amazon has lowered the price on them by 5 dollars from what it was 3 weeks ago when I ordered. What a waste of time and money. If you are looking for inexpensive headphones, check walmart for Koss, they're about the same price and if you decide you don't like them, walmart won't stick you for 5 bucks to return them."
4,Inexpensive and worth every penny!,"The Sennheiser HD 201 is one of the best deals in headphones out there right now. The sound quality is fairly good, and blows anything else in the $15-$20 price range out of the water after about 5 hours of burn-in. There's a reason Sennheiser is my all-time favorite headphone brand, and values like these cans are it."
3,Fits the price,"I bought these to replace my Sony MDR-V700. Couple things that I don't like:* Pads are made from the same thin material that usually peals off after a year of use, as it happened on my Sonys* Weak base sound.* way too long cord.The flip side of all it's only 20 bucks. Money you spend on a sandwich.Feels comfortable on a head, Extremely Light weight."
4,Sennheiser HD201 Lightweight Headphones You hear Clear,"I started buying Sennheiser headphones more than 35 years ago and I am just as happy with this new set as I was by my original pair.Nice headphones with the right price and Sennheiser sound,you can't beat that."
3,HD 201 vs HD 202,"HD 201 - good sound except for the really weak bass. Almost non existent bass. Quite comfortable on the ears, covers the entire ears.HD 202 - great sound with good bass. Rests directly on the ears & can cause a bit of discomfort after a few hours.Given a choice I'll go with the HD202"
2,Disappointed,Was looking forward to these headphones and now I have to return them. The left side doesn't work at all so you don't get any stereo kind of performance. What a disappointment!
3,So So,"Well the sound is the problem with this brand, I cant understand how a big company name just as sennheiser that is supposed to deliver exceptional audio products sell headphones with such a low volume strenght, even the original iPod earphones sound stronger with max volume, the thing is the bass in this ones is great, other cheap earphones cannot play the bass good, at least this one has low volume with high audio quiality, its kind of complicated..."
1,pay little... get even less.,"Bought these at Best Buy only because I wanted a headset with a long cord. The cord for this set is 3 meters... about the longest I've seen. Anyway, they sounded terrible right out of the package. I hear a slight crackle out of the right side whether I'm listening from my laptop or hooked up to my Denon receiver."
5,The Best Value in Studio Headphones,"I got these earphones for $20 down from $30 at a music store to use with my laptop that has bad speakers. Best money I've spent in a long time. Not only are these headphones high quality, comfortable, but they block out noise really well. Very little noise leaks from these babies while they are on, nor is much noise heard around me much while I'm listening to music or movies :) There have been several times I'll be watching a movie or listening to music with these headphones, and I won't hear my roommate calling me, or noise going on around me. The next thing I know my roommate is standing right in front of me and scares me half to death because I didn't hear her coming or calling my name. Not to mention the chord is super long, which is a bonus!If you're looking for a pair of studio headphones for a good price, look no further."
4,Nice headphone,"Pros:Great fit.Reasonable price.SturdyCons:Need to max out the volume on my laptop.VERY long cord (can be a Pro the way you look at it)Unlike most reviewers, I find the fit to be really comfortable. Unless you have a huge head, I think you'll be okay.I am happy with the purchase."
5,Sennheiser HD201 Bang-for-the-Buck Headphones,"Awesome cans for the price. Detailed (very good low level resolution) and accurate (no overblown bass). Excellent timber and dynamics. A nice balance of warmth and speed. Very easy to listen to, over multiple genres. They also match very well with my Indeed G2 Hybrid Tube amp. I can't believe these headphones sound this good, as nexpensive as they are. A winner..."
3,One size does not fit all,"Quality of product and its adherence to printed description are fine. For a man with a large head. Unfortunately, I'm a woman with small head (and ears) so these are not all that comfortable. Keeping anyway because of good price and only occasioinal use. Have earbuds for MP3 player; use these only for short online clips."
5,Great cans for the money,"For the price, this set simply can't be beat. I own two other sets of cans--some Sony MDR's that are around $100 and some AKG K240 MKII's that go for about $200. While this set is a bit lacking in the bass compared to the other two, I find for everyday listening I enjoy them just fine.I spend most of the day on my headphones at my office, so I wanted a pair I could leave here without worrying, and more importantly--a pair that was comfortable for long listening sessions. This set is very lightweight, and the cups fit all the way around your ears (not on top like many), and I was very pleased to find I can wear these all day without any discomfort.If these were ever lost, I would definitely buy another set--at $20 they're a steal."
5,GREAT HEADPHONES,"GOOD PRODUCT PRODUCE GOOD SOUND, GOOD FOR YOUR EVERY DA LISTENING LIGHT GOOD FIT ON YOUR EARSCAME ON TIME GOOD COMPANY"
4,sound quality is good,"these headphone are more substantial than they look online and a bit heavier than they would make you believe. That said I like the fit is good the sound is good, I would definitely recommend them."
3,OK for the price,"The headphones work well but don't expect too much. The padding is comfy for ears and head band good. Decent sound. Great investment for money. NOT made for LOUD listening though. Bass is weak, Doesn't block much sound as expected."
3,Low Volume,The headphones are comfortable and sound good but beware the volume is VERY LOW. If you don't have a preamp or a very loud device this can be a huge problem.
4,Cheap cans with acceptable sound,"It's important to keep in mind that these are a pair of $30 headphones. They're not going to be audiophile quality or anything like that. They sound like what you'd expect for the price, they've held up well in the 2 years I've had them. They feel a little tight after extended use, but I wouldn't consider them head clamps or anything. I'd highly recommend picking these up if you're looking for a pair of over ear cans under $30."
2,"Good for price, but fragile","I bought these headphones about a month ago, and they're now broken. I don't know if I was treating them too harshly or what, but I need more sturdy headphones. The cord was also way too long and annoying (I had to wrap it with a bread tie)."
5,These headphones are amaing!,"For 25 bucks, these headphones truly are the epitome BANG for your buck. These headphones are more aesthetically pleasing than other competators ive tried, sound a lot better too! I too joined the ""Beats by Dre"" cult for a couple months and they ended up being stolen right before a business trip. Looking for a quick replacement with out reading reveiws or anything, i stopped at my local Fry's Electronics and immediately went to the sennheiser section. these were pretty cheap so i picked them up. I tried them out in the car on the way back and i almost swerved when they started playing. I cant believe i spent hundreds on over-rated Beats headphones. I suggest these to people who enjoy a smooth and crisp sound with a surprising amount of bass all rapped up in a nice looking product.Great job Sennheiser!"
3,It doesn't live up to the brand's reputation,"It is ok, but not great. The ear pieces are small, not very comfortable. The sound is not very loud and a little muddy."
4,Cool headphones,"I brought this headphones mainly for watching movies and listening to music without disturbing my room mates. It feels comfortable and is also compact when compared to other huge and bulky headphones(like one from Sony). The build quality is good and looks(and feels) great when you put it on. Although it needs more volume to listen to, this headphone is great for a casual or average listener. This headphone is not for an audiophile. As a casual listener i don't have any issues with this headphone. Ok enough said now. Go get it. You will not be disappointed at all."
4,Good but hot,"I purchased these head phones because I am, I guess, one of those people that ear buds just don't fit and because Sennheiser produced the best pair of light weight head phones ever in the early 70s. The sound was good for the money but after about 15 minutes of listening my ears began to perspire. Noise isolation also produces air flow isolation. If you can live with that you're home free."
5,"For the price, incredible","Every time I put these on I just can't believe that they were less than $30. The sound quality is excellent, they are comfortable and so far (I've had them for about 9 months) they seem to be very durable. Also, the cord length is very generous, maybe even a little too generous. You just can't go wrong with these."
2,"Comfortable, but terrible sound","The fit of the headphones is great. They are light, padded, and cover the ear fully. Given the ear coverage, I expected better sound quality. It is tin-like, all treble. The bass is really flat. There are much better options for over-ear headphones in the same price range. Look elsewhere, unless comfort is your ONLY criteria."
4,Amazing Headphone for the price!,"These headphones are the best that I ever purchased for only $17! I have bought headphones/earphones from Sony, Phillips, Skullcandy, Coby and they were all uncomfortable but I had never tired Sennheiser until a friend told me about them. I am happy to report that these Sennheiser headphones are the most comfortable audio accessory I have ever purchased. Kudos Sennheiser!"
3,Left side died or almost dead after a few months,"I had hoped to replace my old headphone after the left side died upon years and years of use. The HD201s were very nice out of the package, but I was disappointed when the left side died out a few weeks ago. The right channel is going strong, and I've checked all my settings and other earbuds and headphones to make sure I didn't make some kind of sound adjustment on my computer. Tests confirmed that the left side is essentially dead...on some things, you can hear the left channel, but very faintly.Now I guess I am going to have to replace this with a headset or maybe a pair of wireless headphones. I experimented with Sennheiser after reading all of the good reviews, but I might have to check out another brand after this. At least I got it for a great price during an amazon sale, so it didn't break the bank."
4,Great value and fit! But....,"- Great sound for the price, not very bass-heavy but good mids and highs.- Good (but not great) noise isolation- Fits comfortably despite my large head size.- Extra long cable with adapter.BUT:- Despite the comfortable fit, my head noticeably sweats when wearing the headphones for more than a few minutes. *It's only a negative if you sweat easily (like me).* I've since given them to a friend who's had no problems whatsoever."
5,"Awesome headset, long cord and great fit","Thi is one of the best headphones i have bought so far. It has a long cord and the ear-cups create a tight yet comfortable seal for lasting comfort and sound quality.The HD201 has a 9.5ft non-detachable cable that connects in a ""Y"" to both earcups and terminates in a 3.5mm mini-plug connector.The sound quality is awesome. the construction is solid. I highly recommend this headphone."
3,You get what you pay for,"The HD 201 can be purchased for under $20.You get what you pay for. They are light weight, they don't hurt your ears like buds sometimes do, but they are very low volume on both my laptop or my entertainment PC's. But what can you expect? You get what you pay for.2 *"
2,Not,"I just received this headphones today and I must say I'm rather disappointed. I got these as a replacement ever since one of the headphones of my Sennheiser HD 202's died. There's a world of difference, especially the bass...i just don't hear/feel it. I think I'm gonna upgrade to something else."
4,Great Price and Great Product,I recently bought the Sennheiser HD201s and I have to say they are definitely worth it. The sound is very clear even at high volume. Also they are very comfortable to wear. A great product all around.
2,"Serious problem with ""sssssssssss""","These headphones would have been good except for two things:1. ""ssssssss"" sound problem... (hissing sound - overdrive on anyting ""s"" sounding)2. poor base level3. average on percussionsThe JWIN JHV100 Closed-Type Pro Digital Studio Monitor Headphones (which are mostly given away free) are much better than these headphones."
1,"Will not ""Pump up your MP3 player""","The ad on Amazon for these headphones said ""Pump up your MP3 player"". However these headphones cannot be plugged into a MP3 player as the connector is too big for the jack. I looked at other reviews and none mentioned this fact, and I felt other people should be warned so they would be spared the waste due to false expectations. I might as well throw mine away, the only point was to replace those annoying earbuds."
1,Sound pretty bad,"These don't sound very good, I wanted to replace a pair of Grado SR60 open headphones I use at work so I'd make less noise, but I really don't like them. They sound very cold and small, like listening to a cheap radio in another room. Even cheap earbuds sound better. I didn't expect them to sound as good as the Grados, but to at least be passable. I'm just going to keep using the Grados, and throw these in a drawer or something."
2,decent,"good for the money possibly, yeh because they go around and over the ear, pretty well cancelled the noiseword word word word"
2,Sennheiser Headphones,"I chose these because I needed an extra pair for airline travel. I had purchased Sennheiser before and the quality was very good. I didn't get to check the sound because these never made it to the flight. Once I put them over my ears, they were so uncomfortable that I had to send them back. Also were bulkier than what I had expected form the description."
2,Below average sound quality,"I didn't like the product. Low bass, below average sound. Buy a Sony instead! The product (material) is ok though...hence I am giving it 2 stars."
2,Sucky,"I got these after breaking a pair of Sharper Image noise-cancelling headphones, thinking that Sennheiser would be a good replacement, noise-cancelling or not. Not really. I used them just one day, trying them with digitally remastered music, even music mixed in *5.1 Surround Sound*, and there was just no boom from the bass, like was promised on the packaging. At a higher volume, the music is slightly more quality, but the music still lacked substance to me.There was this, and there was the fact that the leatherette around the edge of each of the earpieces gave me discomfort because the phones concealed my ears completely but not my lobes, and it felt almost like blood got cut off at that part. For this and the above reason I am sending these things back.In all, don't get these if you want wraparound headphones and you think ""Sennheiser = Class."" I suppose these would be more suitable as DJ headphones, but I do not know."
3,"If you like bass, don't get these headphones.","I read a lot of reviews on these headphones before getting them when they were on sale for $16. I saw a couple of reviews that said that the bass is not great on this set, but with the overwhelmingly positive response I decided that at that price it was worth a shot. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The overall sound is nice, but I have cheap Sony sport headphones with better bass response than these HD 201s.If you don't really care about bass (i.e. if you don't like R&B;, hip hop, or electronic music), then you will probably be very happy with these headphones. If that's not the case, save your money for something better."
2,Not comfortable; pulls hairs out,"I am not an audiophile, nor a particularly tough critic for things like headphones where most products are ""good enough"" for my rare usage. These headphones, however, are not comfortable around the ears in my opinion. It also pulls a hair or two out of my head just about every time I take them off (I have short hair). Sound quality seems fine to me, but again, I'm not qualified to really speak to it in detail. The cord is sufficiently long which is nice."
4,Good quality for the price!,"This is my first set of Sennheiser headphones. The brand was recommended by a friend. The sound quality is great (especially for the price) and while they aren't ""noise canceling"" they provide great coverage of outside noise, they're comfortable and easy to wear for long periods of time (I tend to wear them for 3-5 hours at a time). The chord is nice and long, the sound quality is great, and it comes with an adapter plug."
4,Met the needs I bought it for,Let's me work in my noisey office and not be distracted. I can play soft music or just keep them on to cut down on noise. They are light but effective.
3,OK,"I really like long cable. Great for the kids piano, which was the purpose we bought this thing for! The sounds seems to be OK on the piano, but I have not tried in on for instand an mp3 player and a stereo. Somehow the volume seems a little low though.... for the price you can not complain."
4,Definitely lightweight,"I use these for those days that I want to be reviewing recordings while in bed. I need something with a truer response than my laptop speakers, and these are the right price for that.These headphones are definitely lightweight. The sound is as clear as with an ear bud, but without having a foreign object in your head. The bass response leaves something to be desired, but that will always be the case with lightweight headphones. The cable is longer than I anticipated, which in this case is a bad thing - it's too long and gets tangled up, and you're likely to experience the same thing if you're using it with an ipod in yr pocket. I guess I could bundle up the part of the cable I'm not using.Overall, I will want to review my recordings with the Klipsh setup in my office, but that's what I expected. For casual listening, these are more than adequate."
2,not for me,"These headphones might be good if you use them at home, but I wanted to use them in my mp3 player and for some reason the player kept stopping. Usually that means that the headphones had come unplugged, but they were not coming unplugged so I guess the connection is just not very good. Too bad because they were super light and comfortable, but I am back to my old headphones that don't have this problem.Like I said, probably a good deal if you just use them at home."
3,Not Without Quirks,"I'll start by saying I don't think you'll find a better pair for the $20 price. Unfortunately I made the mistake of listening with my friends $80 Sony cans, and these are far inferior. The sound is much cleaner than many headphones I've used but does not have the great bass that you'll find in more expensive pairs.But the lack of awesome bass isn't my real complaint with these headphones. One of my main reasons for buying these was that they are over the ear and I thought they would be comfortable. I don't know if my ears fit into the large category (I never thought of myself as having large ears), but the part of my ears that sticks out most in the middle (there is plenty of space top and bottom) makes contact with the hard plastic that is behind a thin layer of fabric. It starts to hurt after a half hour or so of wearing them."
4,"Great sound, a little stiff to wear","These headphones sound great, but w/ the plastic headband they're a little uncomfortable to wear. A metal headband w/ more flexibility would be better."
4,Great headphones for the Price!,"I had plain cheap pair of headphones before, but when I got this model, wow the difference was awesome!. First of all they're close-eared so you don't listen to any other sound in the environment. Extremely comfortable you can use them for hours!. The padding and plastic are well made and good quality.To be honest I expected a better sound quality, but I guess that depends more on you soundcard ( I use these primarily with my computer) but for the low price I don't think you can get anything better, I'm very impressed and happy with my purchase of this product!"
3,"Good sound for the price, but not durable enough","I like Sennheiser headphones in general, and have bought several pairs that I've been very happy with. These HD201 headphones sound really good for the price, and provide decent isolation from outside sounds. However, I wish they had been made a bit more durable, even if that raised the price by a few dollars. Two pairs of these developed problems with the cables in the space of several months, and they were only used a few times per week, for a few hours each time. That's a shame, because these are otherwise a bargain."
3,"OK Sound, OK Comfort, OK Value","What can I say, they are OK.Sound: Crisp and clear highs, that's about it. Yes, the bass is lacking and somewhat nonexistent which is unfortunate. My motivation to buy was a desire to enjoy late night movies with a full body of sound, not wanting to disturb others. Well, I should have listened to the other reviewers regarding the bass, they were right.Comfort: Multi-directional earpieces help and they are definitely lightweight, but almost to the point of feeling cheap.Overall, like I said, they are just OK. Don't make the same mistake and underestimate your need for bass. I did and now I will be looking to invest in a better set of phones."
4,Excelente sound for low price,"This headphone really sounds good, very cristal and noiseless.Plastic feels confortable but weak, and cord is kind skinny.Output volume is not to loud, be awere if you like extra loud listening.Bottom line, great for 20us!"
4,Great sound with comfort.,"Have been seeking Headphones that are comfortable for an ecomonical price. These fit the bill. Can't wear earbuds and most over-ear headphones become uncomfortable after wearing a while. I've worn these for several hours at a time without discomfort. As I'm not a sound aficionado, the quality is good for me, maybe not top quality but very good in my opinion."
3,Uncomfortable and Mediocre Sound Quality -- OK for $15 though,"Pros: cheap, really long cord, build quality above average for the priceCons: After about 15 min of use, they become extremely uncomfortable -- as if the padding wasn't even there!! Buyer beware, these are not nearly as comfortable as they look in the pictures!! Also, the sound quality is mediocre; volume is very low and bass is almost nonexistent.Other Thoughts: For $15 these are OK, but if you plan on buying these for long-term use (for computer, mp3 player, etc), then invest in a better pair such as the Sony MDR-XB300 ($31) or the Sony MDR-XB500 ($49)"
4,Good for the money,These are pretty good headphones. They aren't mind blowing or anything but they are definitely a good bang for your buck. The sound quality is pretty good but the bass is lacking. They aren't completely noise cancelling but they are pretty good (I listen to my music pretty loud anyway). You can't really beat the quality for the price. Right now they are listed for $17 (I paid $22). If you are looking for headphones for casual listening or maybe some light music production these are pretty good for the price.
2,SMALL!!,"I have to admit that I do have a big head, but these headphones are just impossible to break in to. Also, don't be deceived by the photo. It really looks cheap. But it is still super strong. It took a lot of beating."
5,"So far, so good",I don't know anyone who really likes ear-buds so over ear with good noise cancelling was what I searched for. These are for my son and he also wears glasses so the bows are sometimes an issue but he said these are comfortable and they do a good job cancelling out all other noise.
4,Great headphones for the price,"These headphones sound awesome! When I first bought them I was amazed by how much bump these things put out. They're great headphones not much more to say. I give it 4 stars because the inside of the ear cup is hard. It's made out of plastic and is covered with some mesh like black fabric which starts to hurt my ears after awhile. So if you have big ears then these definitely aren't the epitome of comfortableness.In conclusion, good product just a bit uncomfortable if you have big ears that protrude a bit."
4,Not the best but worth it.,"These headphones were ok, for the price its a good deal. But quality was not what i was led to believe. These are good for the average person, not all that great for any studio work. however they are a good place to start."
4,Good headphones,"They are headphones. They work. The cord is really long. I can't really wear them for too long, they start to hurt my ears. :/"
2,I really don't like it. Causes have written below.,"Why does it have to be this long? No, really, it is too long to handle for people who would use it at home.Sound quality is decent for its price, can't complain. As for comfort, it's doesn't really fit well for big-headed people like me.Your ears may sweat in this headphone if you use it for a long time."
4,Looks Great so far...,So I ordered these through Pepsi points and got them in 3 days. WOW... (Still waiting for the totes I ordered the same day) Took them out of the box and they look very nice and comfy. Tried them on my 4yr old son since I got them for road trips and the dvd player. Fit him like glove on the smallest size. Then tried them on my hubby and there was still room to make them bigger. I tried them on and was surprised and how much noise it blocked out and they were not even plugged in. (Now I am comparing them to the ear phones you get that go in your ears or clip over your ears like a bluetooth.) I'm looking forward to nice quiet road trips in the future.
5,WOW!! Great Sound!,"What can i say, love these headphones. They work wonderfully and the sound is exquisite! A bit bulky, but it knocks out all the outside sounds and lets you enjoy the book or music or whatever you want to listen to without interruptions of noise from the room or wherever you are. Comfortable as they can be, and no crackling when the cord is moved, no fading just great sound!! and an extra long cord!! Great Buy!!"
4,Great value for headphones,I have been using earbuds and constantly pulling them out or catching them on something from the short cable. These are very nice headphones and have a long cable that allows me to move around and not pull the cord out. Comfortable and decent sound for the value. I recommend them if you want comfort and good quality sound.
3,"For about $11 more, Sennheiser EH150 is much better!","I have both the Sennheiser HD201 and EH150 headphones. Listening to Jennifer Lopez's ""Waiting For Tonight"", it is very apparent that the EH150 has a lot more volume, dynamic range, and bass than the HD201.I bought the HD201 for my teen-aged son who typically goes through a pair of headphones in 3 months. I wanted to buy something that is high quality name brand but still doesn't cost too much. Althogh I did not know at the time of purchase, the relatively lower volume and lighter bass characteristics of the HD201 is ideal for him, in his father's judgement. I have the fear that he always turns up the volume too high and may hurt his eardrums.If you are shopping for a pair for yourself or another adult who knows better, I'd recommend the Sennheiser EH150, which costs just $11 more than HD201."
3,"Great Quality, But Flimsy Headband","I've had these headphones for a few weeks, and the sound quality has exceeded my expectations, and is an amazing deal for the price, but they have a large flaw. The headband of the headphones connect to the can by a small piece of plastic so that the headphones can swivel a bit. But while the rest of the headphone seems very sturdy, this part is very flimsy. Just from once being carried in a backpack, this part snapped. So quality, and comfort wise this is a bargain, but be careful with the headband piece."
4,Good deal,Seems like a decent set...I love music but don't buy into the whole Bowes prices...Sound is crisp...could be a bit louder and a bit more base but hey you get what you pay for.
2,Just lousy sound,"I just bought these after reading many reviews, and boy am I disappointed. I'll just toss them out. The only way I can describe the sound is ""thin"". No bass, strange distant sort of sound. They are comfortable, I'll give them that. But what a disappointment as far as the sound."
3,Mediocre,"I've heard great headphones, and these don't even come close. They are average/mediocre at best. They look great, feel great, and are a good design, but the sound just does not deliver. It's a shame, because this style of headphones, from a respected manufacturer that cup your ears, should have no excuse for not sounding great. They don't sound bad, just on the weak and anemic side. I purchased them on sale at NewEgg for $14.95 shipped, and for that price MAYBE they are worth using as a back-up, and emergency alternative to more satisfying ones."
3,Decent for the price,"These headphones are not the loudest I've seen. The bass response isn't the greatest either. However for the price you can't really expect super-high quality. The sound is, however, very clear even at the highest volume. That is a plus. If you are an audiophile spend more money."
3,Great,"this 20 dollars headphone sound cheap when you look at them , but in reality they sound nice , great bass,i used them with my computer to make music, i consider buy another pair just in case . only con , the cable is too thick but it's ok"
3,"Good headphones, but there are better ones for this price range.","The HD201 is the entry level headphones from Sennheiser. Considering the price you pay, it is value for money. However, if you are able to pay more, get a higher end Sennheiser headphones. I have a HD205 and it goes without saying that the HD205 is better than the HD201.What I do like about the HD201 is that it is lightweight and it is comfortable and fits round the ears very well. The closed ear headphones also reduces some ambient noise. However, it is not a very ""loud"" headphone and when I turned to maximum volume on my player, I could hear a slight distortion.Below are the technical specifications:Acounstic principle: Dynamic, closedEar coupling: CircumauralFrequency response: 21-18,000 HzMax SPL at 1kHz, 1 Vrms: 108 dBTHD at 1kHz, 100 dB SPL: < 0.7%Impedance: 24 OhmsWeight (without cable): 165 gSignal cable: 3 m copper cable (OFC)Connector/adapter: 3.5 mm stereo jack with 6.3 mm adapter"
4,Good headphones for a great price,"These are great headphones for the price. Obviously not for traveling, but they provide good attenuation of external noise and clear sound."
4,Good Value,"For the price I got this, it was a steal. Got this for gaming in an noisy environment, so sound isolation was a must. Headphones fit snugly, although after hours of use, the pressure on your ears starts to ache a bit. Fair sound isolation, fairly good sound reproduction, if a bit weak on the bass. I was disappointed by the lack of an in-line volume control though. Those with a higher budget might want to consider the HD-280."
3,You get what your pay for.,"Well, I just received these headphones and using them as I type this review. I sound isn't all that bad, but this headphone really lack BASS. Even on my ipod with the ""Bass Booster"" EQ setting the headphones really don't deliver the bass well. These headphones do block the outside noises fairly well.I had a pair of HD-202 and unfortunately my left channel went out and I only had the right channel. When my HD-202 were working though I defintely thought they delivered better bass than the 201's.If bass is important to you, then I would spend a few more buck and get the 202's and if you're really on a budget, then get the 201's.Overall, for the price you really can't complain too much about these headphones. Hopefully they will last longer than my 202's."
3,Sound is too low!,"I haven't seen anyone else mention this, but when I connect these headphones to my computer just like any other pair of headphones, I can barely hear my music! They're nice look, nice feeling, and I can sort of tell, given the right amount of amplified power they'd probably have good sound, but I can't hear my music!!!"
1,No volume or bass,These have all the looks but no sound quality to back it up. Horrible. My kids Skullz headphones sound better for half the price.
1,Another barley over the ear uncomfortable peice of garbage.,Please buy this if you want headphone with 2 rigid skinny wires in your way constantly and hard plastic pushing down on the ridges of your ears making them sore after 30 minutes.
3,Cancels the wrong noises.,Sound is good. Comfortable. They block out all the other noises except the ones I want them to. I work in an office with people that work 2 hours a day and visit 6 hours a day. The headphones block out eveything else except their voices...in fact it almost makes their voices clearer...no good for me. I will be returning them or giving them to someone else as regular head phones.
3,Noise Canceling? Nope,"I was lead to believe that these were noise canceling. They sound great, but I wanted noise canceling because I am taking a long plane ride and did not want to be bothered. Do not misunderstand, they sound great, but if you wanted noise canceling go else where."
3,"Bright Sound, Not Loud, 10 Foot Cord","The sound on these headphones are what you get when you spend 17 dollars for headphones. It seems like the headphones lack bass response making the overall sound seem a little bright. Also, the ipod stock headphones can go louder than these which I find a little strange. Lastly, the cord is many feet long making it virtually impossible to travel with. I tried to clump part of the cable together with a twist tie to make it smaller but it really doesn't work well for traveling.Using these on the computer is useful because of the generous cord length which does come in handy now and then.Overall, I would say to only buy this product if you don't want to spend much money and plan to use these headphones inside. Otherwise, look elsewhere."
2,OK for the price,"Very poor sound quality. Way too much bass in my opinion.Not very comfortable after 1 hour of use.Nice looks. Stylish.Excellent price.So if you're looking for a pair of inexpensive cans for the daily commute and really don't mind about thier sound quality capabilities, this might be the best option in the market. Great looks and again a bargain."
3,Uncomfortable,"The sound quality of this headset is quite good but I'm disappointed with its design. Its very uncomfortable, you can't wear it for long. Its very tight on the head and the ear-cushion is not good.I've used Koss before and would suggest to go with that."
3,An average headphone for high class price.,"With priced at a high end headphones with a company like this , one expects a quality sound when you wear this . And guess what you do get a sound quality, but the collateral irritations that this headphone brings makes you to re0think why was one tempted to buy this item.1. Twisted cables - Just after few wearings the cables start getting twisted and they cling onto your neck.2. Long wires unable to drag.3. It does not fit onto different ear sizes."
1,"No, No...Just No!","I could muse about the shaky, rattly build quality, or I could Ask where the bass has gone? Please spend a few more dollars for the HD202's.I wanted to give them no stars whatsoever, but I had to give them 1 star to put the review in."
1,Disappointment,"Bass is non-existent. Only thing you can hear is the highs... they're not loud enough.After my hd202s these sound like dog poo.HONESTLY BUY THE HD202s or HD212s, YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!!"
2,Pretty dull,"The problem with this book was that the secondary female character of Avalon overshadowed the more demure and sweet younfg Jessica totally. The whole relationhip build up with Jessica and Dash never amounted to anything, and her relationship with the man of her dreams was also a final epilgoue in the last five pages of the book. Another female characcter in Sasha, and some stuff straight out oa Harelquin romance, made this book really tedious. I was looking for something a lot more intense. And I never did understand why Jessica gave her boyfriend the boot. she really was not interesting at all. For those who like spanking, great, otherwise, yawn."
2,Plot? What plot?,"With two years of writing in Paris under her belt, Jessica is a barely out of high school cub reporter working and sleeping her way up at an LA Weekly magazine. Her boyfriend Kelly is a bartender/actor waiting to be discovered for the perfect role. There's plenty of sex and little else in this story, and it was a real chore to get through. An immature heroine who is about as interesting as a CSPAN broadcast, it's really hard to care about her character, particularly when the alluring and cultured Avalon shares the page (among other things) with her.While I love a spicy novel, this one was so redundant and boring that I found myself skipping the numerous sex scenes to get to the plot... and unfortunately, realized that there is no real plot. Sure wish I had read the reviews on this one before wasting money on it! Save your money and get a novel by Emma Holly instead."
2,Who knew erotica could put you to sleep?,"I rarely put down a book unfinished, but I only got through a third of this one.1. Pretty 20-year-olds are boring. There's a reason why the character Avalon (gossip columnist for the newspaper) stole every scene she was in; she was experienced enough to have some depth, which made the sex charge that much hotter.2. While I don't demand too much of a plot from erotic novels, having some storyline makes me anticipate reading on, not just a disconnected series of sex scenes.3. This one is purely personal: I live in LA. I love LA. This, Madam, is not LA -- it's the Los Angeles of cliche and clique. Yes, again, this is a fantasy, but if I'm constantly arguing with the book, I kind of lose track of who is doing what to whom with what in whose bed."
5,Best Decorations,My husband is retired military and still works at a base. I use these for cupcakes and cakes. They are always a hit and you cannot beat Amazon's price. Thanks for making them available.
3,Not as described,"These hot handle holders work well, but they are a lot smaller than described. Mine is only 5 3/4 inches long and 2 3/4 inches wide...a lot smaller than I expected."
2,Charred first time I tried them,"These are very attractive little ""mittens"" for your cast iron handles. I like how they look, but they are very thin and charred the first time I tried them.I believe they would work for cases where the pan is not on the stove, and is being used on the table to serve from. When they are used with a pan that is actively being heated, they just can't handle the heat."
1,hot handle holder,"These were to big for handles of the cast iron pan,,I wouldn't buy them unless you know they will fit"
3,Lover of ironware,"I love these Lodge iron products, having used the huge 11-pount wok (seasoned it myself) and the also-very-heavy chicken fryer. I always cook with high heat (gas stove) and the handles do get hot. I own a pair of these handle holders and they're fine--no complaints. I don't think I could ever burn myself holding the handle if these are in place but for the price I'd much rather just buy some handy towels and drape them over the handles. I'm happy to have the holders but if I could choose again, I wouldn't buy them; I think those $7 are better spent elsewhere."
4,Good for when you bake or roast in your skillet,"Works like one would expect. I use it rather than a pot holder/oven mitt when removing the cast iron from the oven. It's perfect for the task, especially since my hands don't go into oven mitts easily. It is a ""unitasker"" but worth it for frequent cast iron bakers."
2,My review,"These are handy, but we've found that you really just need a potholder to cook with cast iron., especially if you use a lid."
2,easy solution,"Our society is an instant gratification one.The simplest solution to hot handles on cast iron pots and pans is to take a really inexpensive hot pad, and cut it in half and sew it up.I am a guy and I have no problem getting out my my speedy stitcher and putting two handle covers together in 20 mins.The lodge covers work, but mine work better at 1/4 the price."
3,Hot Handle Holder Set,"OVER PRICED AT $5.99, MOST CRAFT SHOWS HAVE THEM FOR $2 A SET. THEY WORK FINE THOUGH FOR THE IRON SKILLETS"
2,"Oh-so-cute, but not particularly useful.","I first purchased these because I needed pot holders, so I was surprised when they arrived to see that they would only cover one finger at a time. (NOT THE MANUFACTURER'S FAULT). Having admitted that embarrassing piece of information, I still don't find them useful. Unlike other reviewers, I dont' feel comfortable leaving the handle holder on while cooking (I have a gas oven)and trying to put them on after the skillet has been on the stove defeats the purpose.Beyond that....I love the chili pepper design! 8-)"
5,It works well with my Lodge skillet,I use it for my Lodge skillet. It fits the skillet well. I do not use kitchen towel to wrap the handle of the skillet anymore.
2,Not durable enough.,"They know what people use these for, right?After two uses, one of mine has a burned seam border on the edge. I was using it on a skillet on the range at medium heat. It never got too hot to handle, and I did NOT leave it one for more than a few minutes at a time, but, it probably only has one or two more uses in it before it's completely ruined.Years ago, I worked in a restaurant and we had these for the fajita skillets that this never would have happened to. I'd like to know who made those."
4,nice touch,"I got this, and a cast iron pan(my 2nd one)... and this is a lot better than wrapin a hot pad around it.. looks good 2!"
1,Fire Hazard! Beware!!,"While these work well to protect your hand from burns, DO NOT leave them on the pan while cooking on a gas stove. They have caught fire more than once! I now put them on only when I need to pick up the pan and only after the stove is off."
3,Cheerful but Thin.,"Since this is marketed by Lodge, I expected something more substantial - thicker and heavier for hefting cast iron cookware. However, it's cheerful and fits the handles well. Serves as a good reminder to NOT pick up the hot pan without a potholder."
5,2-Piece pot holder set,"I love the 2-Piece Hot Handle Holder Set(red Pepper). It makes it so easy to just grab the pot and not have to worry about burning your hands, I would not be with out it."
1,"If you have a gas stove, DO NOT BUY THESE!!!","This is my first one-star review on Amazon. (I hope I don't have any more!)The holders were helpful, but are NOT flame-retardant!!!I tried one, and it caught on fire while I just had my back turned. It was not over the flame (and I used it on a larger skillet). I threw the holder away, thinking it could have been defective, and it happened to a 2nd one.Why would they NOT be flame retardant???"
5,Excellent book for gay people or those that love us,"When I came out, among the first books I read on being gay were from Rik Isensee and Richard Isay, and they were extremely useful and uplifting. Be sure to pick up this and the companion book, Isay's Becoming Gay. If you're struggling with self acceptance and coming out issues, or know someone who is, this is a great place to start learning. First comes self acceptance, then loving who you truly are - THEN you can tell someone else all about who you are. Once you've got the self-acceptance part down, the rest is incredibly easy. You can't go wrong with this author on any of his books on being gay."
1,"May be a good pan, but...","This may be a good pan, but someone needs to improve the packaging used for shipping. Both of the units I ordered came broken, with cracked handles."
2,Disappointed,Have read 5 of Conroy's books and did not want them to end. Will reread each in the years to come.Do not know if I will finish this one.
3,Nice surprise,I was pleasantly surprised to find a Pat Conroy book I had not read. It was much better than a lot of authors first books that only got published because that author became a big name down the road. I enjoyed this early work of what would become one of my favorite authors. You got a nice insight into the truly wonderful writer that Pat Conroy would become.
4,Excellent view of The Citadel,"This book is a biographical/autobiographical novel about Pat Conroy's experiences in the Citadel, especially as they relate to The Boo, the Colonel in charge of The Citadel at the time Conroy attended. There are letters, memos, and anecdotes about The Boo's relationship with others in the school.I found this to be an excellent portrayal of Citadel life. We on the outside think of the cadets as stern and commanding, but this book showed them being human. It also showed the sense of humor that The Boo had when dealing with the ""Lambs"" and the ""Bums"".I found this book to be especially interesting after reading Lords of Discipline because I could see how autobiographical that novel was. Many of the experiences the characters had in Lords of Discipline came from acual experiences the cadets had in the Citadel.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Conroy's work, especially Lords of Discipline. I liked the insights I got into his character."
4,Reality of the Military College,"Pat Conroy wrote the Lords of Discipline not only out of the desire to write and be published, but to give us an insight as to what went on inside the Citadel walls. I think only a person who knows what actually goes on there could write such a book. Of course, Mr. Conroy is persona non grata at the Citadel. His portrayal of the school is less than favorable, but very realistic. The letters written between Courvoisie and the mother are excerpts of actual letters. Conroy did not make these up. Read to see what this fascinating man had to answer. I found The Boo to be truly revealing about life at The Citadel. This is the only book Conroy wrote in which he did not make a significant effort to mask those involved."
3,Done by an artist in black and white,"Pat Conroy is one of Americas greatest writers. This is not one of his best book, it is his first book. It provides readers of Conroy a better understanding of how he grew into that position. In its own way it is the most interesting of his works.All young men should read his works from beginning to end."
2,Pat Conroy's first book definitely hid his literary genius.,"Mr. Conroy's idolization of the Colonel is obvious, but the book is slow moving, hard to follow and definitely hid his literary genius to be shared with us in his later writings."
3,early Conroy,"I have enjoyed Pat Conroy's writings and have read most of what he has written. ""The Boo"" is early Conroy and you can discern it as such, but it is not up to the standards of his later writings and he says as much in introduction. It is worth reading and helpful to understand some of his later more mature writings. Still, it was enjoyable."
2,Reining Videos,"I own several different reining videos/guides and this is on the lower end. The video quality itself is not so great but more disappointing was the content.Tegtmeier is very articulate about reining, but you quickly get the opinion that he is an ""old school"" training who believes in some very ""physical""/bullying tactics.The horses in the video do not seem very disciplined or well-trained. Part of that is Tegtmeier obviously trying to explain the training and being somewhat distracted. Still, you would expect the best mounts he had available to be showcased in the video.Not impressed with the strategies, training techniques, or ""drills"" discussed in this video. I will probably not watch it again."
3,Fairly Standard Hoyt,"This is not a history of the Russo-German War but rather speculation on what Stalin and his cronies may have thought and said. Many conversations are given as direct quotes, but without attribution. When the author does appeal to authority to support his conclusions, that authority is often one of his own books! But this is not intended to be a scholarly work, just an enjoyable, easy read, which it is. One lack I noticed is that there is not a single map included in the book. But then again, the book is not really about what is going on on the ground (though major campaigns are described), but what is going on in Stalin's mind. Offsetting the lack of maps is the inclusion of many sidebars, some a couple of pages long, that I often found more interesting and informative than the text itself. Good for Hoyt fans."
4,Very passionate and sensual,"I loved it. I especially loved the connection with the Witches. After I read the book I did some more research on the Wicas. Even though it didn't have too many sex scenes, there was a lot of sensuality and desire that really made the story vivid for me. The only part of the story that was not realized to its potential was the threat of evil from the past. I thought it would incarnate into something physical but it never really amassed to much. Fortunately, the rest of the story line was strong enough without it and very powerful indeed."
1,very cheap design,"I've had a number of these by other manufacturers, this is by far the worst design and quality I've ever had. Just cheaply made."
5,Idea book--read this before you make your next quilt,"Darlene clearly explains how to determine quilt sizes,adjusting sizes to fit your needs,and what options are available to you in making adjustments. She gets you thinking about different ways to set blocks and whether or not to have sashings. This book covers setting triangles, lengthwise versus widthwise borders, prairie points, scalloped edges, scalloped edges within a square outer border, ice cream cone borders, flanges, mitered borders and more. Binding secrets,borders using border prints and even ruffled pillows are included. This book has clear illustrations and will give you wonderful new ideas for your next project."
3,Quilters Edge,"This book as some very lovely quilts as examples, but uses the same quilts multiple times. I'd liked to have seen more individual examples.The color pages are lovely and directions are easy to understand. I had hoped for more ideas, but the ones given are very useful."
3,More instructions needed,"I was looking for more detailed instructions of how to do these things. Lots of pictures not enough tips, tricks, etc"
3,"The Quilter's Edge: Borders, Bindings and Finishing Touches (","A little disappointed in the instructions I was looking for. More noticeably the book has an odor, musty, smoky.I know it is a ""used"" book, but I am disappointed, but I think the book was rated higher than it deserved."
4,Quilter's Edge,This book has many good tips and a variety of edges. It is easy to follow. I have waited a while to get this book and am glad I have it now.
5,"The Quilter's Edge: Borders, Bindings and Finishing Touches","I found this book to be very helpful and it added new ways of finishing my quilts. Liked to it so much, I ordered two more for gifts."
4,Darlene Zimmerman Quilts,"Wanted this book for my small collection, as haven't used it yet. Pictures are bright and colorful for viewing."
2,"Some good songs, but it doesn't flow like the old days.","""Time"" (1995) didn't even chart, just a bad time when grunge was king, and pop-rock stuff from the 70's was just dead in the water. Dave Mason (Traffic) and Bekka Bramlett joined the Mac for there only album together. Billy Burnette's a good guitar player, but not up to Lindsey Buckingham's stature. My favorite tunes were all Christine McVie's songs, ""the countryish sounding ""Hollywood (Some Other Kind Of Town)"", the pop of ""I Do"", which got some plays in '95 and a nice epic length tune ""These Strange Times"". It would be 2 years later FM would come back with ""The Dance"", and regain their mojo."
5,The Beat Continues,"There is not a bad song on the set. Solid writing. A new era of Fleetwood Mac, though short lived, but equal to the Danny Kirwan Jeremy Spencer era. Some people forget that there was Fleetwood before the Stevie/Buckingham era. Worthy addition to any collection."
5,Truly a lost classic,"I think this cd got lost in the shuffle. It's a heavily underated gem. I love this cd and got alot of mileage out of it. I think the problem was that this album wasn't promoted. I found out about it a couple years after it came out. Most of the songs on this cd are excellent. Dave Mason added an exellent lead vocal to the mix. Christined McVie's songs are outstanding. Becka Bramletts vocals did not make anyone forget about Stevie Nicks. I though Bramletts vocals were the worst thing about this cd. Billy Burnette's lead vocals were a little rough as well. But if you like Fleetwood Mac's style, buy this cd. I think most of the songs are outstanding and this cd never got the recognition that it deserved."
2,Not bad but not great.,"A funny one this. After being a Mac fan all my life I thought I had all their stuff (from Buckingham/Nicks onward). But I only found out about this album about 3 years ago by chance when reading through a Guinness Book of Hit Singles. Anyway, Time is a decent fist at flogging a dead horse, it twitches to life from time to time but ultimately falls back down. Short story. If you don't have it, you don't NEED it. For completists only."
3,Deserves a fair hearing !,"This is FLEETWOOD MAC without LINDEY BUCKINHAM and STEVIE NICKS. Since two out of 3 main songwriters fo the most popular line up the band had, CRISTINE MCVIE takes over the lead. She shines all the way with some of her best songs ever. Hollywood (Some Other Kind Of Town, Sooner Or Later (Album Version), Nights In Estoril (Album Versionn) and mainly ""All Over Again"". All songs penned by Cristine McVie are the CDs best. Dave Mason, writes and sings a couple. If only could have been a part of this band at his heyday.....Becka Brammlet is a good singer but maybe her voice is best for country music.The big surprise is Mick Fledwood himself writing and givin a vocal performance at his ""These Strange Times"". A perfect way to close this cd, since for this band, these were very strange times...."
3,Sorry for saying this Fleetwood Mac...but it's not the same!,"Fleetwood Mac is the greatest band of all time without a question. That's why it pains me to write this review. I have to tell everyone, there's just something missing. Stay with The Dance, Tango In The Night, or Behind the Mask. Those are the albums to love...(I'm sorry Fleetwood Mac!!) On a happier note, Christine McVie still performs perfectly :)"
2,Time to Call It Quits,"On ""Behind the Mask,"" Fleetwood Mac tried - and almost succeeded - to replace the irreplacable Lindsay Buckingham. Afterwards, Stevie Nicks called it quits, and was replaced on ""Time"" with newcomer Bekka Bramlett. And '70s veteran Dave Mason was thrown in for good measure. The result barely rises above awful. Even the otherwise reliable Christine McVie - the only remaining songwriter from Fleetwood Mac's glory years - turns in mediocre efforts (perhaps in an attempt to match the boring efforts of the rest of this thrown-together group).In short, ""Time"" is for fanatical Fleetwood Mac completists only. If you are one of them, you already have this disc. If not, there's nothing for you to see here; hit the ""Back"" button on your Web browser and don't come back..."
1,Don't waste your time,"Although there are a COUPLE of decent songs on this album, it should have NEVER had the name Fleetwood Mac on it. Without STEVIE NICKS, there is no Fleetwood Mac. Thank God for ""The Dance""!"
3,OK but had to return it,It was very nice however the lid did not fit properly on the base so I had to return it.
1,Lousy packaging,"The product arrived broken in pieces. The packaging was woefully inadequate, and the box was not even marked ""Fragile."" What a disappointment."
2,Poor packaging,"This is a fragile item, and is poorly packed for ordinary shipping. The result is the item arrived with the top broken into many pieces. To Amazon's credit, they made returning the item and requesting a replacement very easy, although the whole process is time consuming and inconvenient. Other Rometopf bakers I use work well for their purpose and are very easy to use. I do highly recommend the product and shopping with Amazon!"
4,Romertopf 117 review,"The item was great but I prefer the glazed version. The glazed version I used to have never burn anything I baked but this one failed on the 1st try. Overall, I think it is still a good pot. I'll just have to make adjustments on my baking style."
1,Defective Product Sent Multiple Times,"I'm a HUGE fan of Amazon, so this makes me very upset to write, but..I ordered this product first time, it was defective. Had some rust spot on the side of the pot. So I returned it and ordered a second pot with the same exact defect on the same place on the pot. I really really wanted this pot, so I ordered it again and called customer service to ensure they check it before they ship out to me. Well......I received the 3rd pot and it had the same rust spot at the same exact location. Shame on Amazon...Just can't get it right."
3,nice quality,"big and deep enough for a small meal. nice quality. as advertised.heats quickly. caution, cast iron handles can get hot."
3,Eh,"I REALLY want to use cast-iron because I know its a lot better to cook with. However, this just did not work for me. No matter what I tried to cook in it and how many times I seasoned it, everything stuck to it. I had to scrub the pan every time I cooked something in it because it would stick so bad and I would literally season it 3 or 4 times and then pour extra oil in the pan on top of that to make sure it didn't stick and it still stuck. It was awful."
3,Ugh don't buy!,"I did my research and for a gas stove this was recommended . It's just a terrible pan. I followed all the directions and the food still sticks terribly. Plus, I don't feel confident that eating out of the cast iron skillet is that safe for my kids."
3,Not ideal...,"I bought this with the idea of using it for frying an egg or two, since eggs stick to my stainless pans. If you have the same idea, don't buy this! Buy a teflon coated one instead. My old teflon pan was ideal for frying eggs; they slide right off. Since eggs stick, you will have to use a spatula to get the eggs out. But this skillet is too small and the sides too high to allow easy flipping with a spatula. And then the cleaning...this pan does not have a mirror surface, rather a porous one. Eggs get stuck in the pores and don't clean off easily."
5,be carfull the size is the outside diamiter,"I have used lodge cast iron for years and was used to lodges numbering for instance an sk10 would have 10 inches of usable cooking diamiter on the inside but actualy be 12 inches outside diamiter so wen i saw 8 inch lodge skillette i assumed it was an sk8 not the case it is an sk5 . I was giving it away as a wedding gift so it is not a big deal but i have no use for such a small skillette my selfI have a sk8 sk10 sk12 sc10 sc12 7qt duch oven 7qt camp duch oven and griddle there is not much i can't cook in these and i use one or more of them every day.Lodge quality is the best you will find and they are the only maker of cast iron cookware in the USA Don't be fooled by the other imposters.Lodge made by americans in america for americanscook ware thats made to last life times if you take good care of it it'll take good care of you , and you'll be passin them along for gerneations."
5,Perfect pan for baking pies,"I bought three of these pans here on Amazon. They came well packed and were shipped right away. They are perfect to bake sweet and savoury pies. The pans are quite deep and allow for a good stuffed pie for 4 servings. I also use them to make omelettes, and to saute tofu and vegetables.The price is right and shipping is free. You won't go wrong on this."
5,Great Pan,I had one in use for 40 years which I dearly miss but this is a good replacement. I recommend it.
5,this is the best,"this is my second cast iron purchase .the first one was 8 inch i love it so much that i decided to buy 12 inch. i seasoned even though it is already seasoned ""thank you guys from the review that tought me how to do it"". i really give it 5 stars. well worthy"
5,PERFECT FOR SMALLER PORTIONS,"I just started using this pan as it is my first aquisition of cast iron. Unfortunately I threw the one my mother gave me many years ago as she didn't tell me how to care for it and I had no clue, so out it went as I thought it was useless. I purchased this 8 inch as well as the 12 inch to hopefully help with my husband's anemia. Since reading about the benefits of cooking with cast iron and making sure I know how to care for it I am quite hopeful that I can increase his iron levels as well as have superior cookware without the high price of the All-Clad that I so wanted. So far I have made scrambled eggs with little sticking and was quite impressed on how much of the pan is already non-stick on the first usage. I never did cook on non-stick surfaces because of the health risks, so this is a wonderful discovery for me."
5,great pan!,"i wish i could afford more of their pans but unfortunately the air freight fom usa to the dom. rep. is too high, it cost more than the pan itself. the pan is excellent no quibbles,dead easy to clean."
4,Lodge cast-iron 8-inch skillet,"Nice heavy skillet and an idea size for cooking cornbread. However, I followed the directions in preparation for cooking and have experienced the cornbread sticking to bottom of skillet each time I have used it (now about 6 times). It would be exceptionally good were there to be no sticking."
3,"Solid, but really bumpy!","It's going to take a long time to season this flat -- alternatively, I could grind it flat and go back through the seasoning process.I don't mind using this skillet as it is, but I think next time I will look for something pre-ground."
3,Lodge 8 inch cast iron skillet,"Received this skillet and discovered it had scratches in the bottom of it which marred the pre-seasoning. It also had a large scrape on the side inside which was rusted so there was no preseasoning on it. The handle is so short that it is always overheating.I own 2 other Farberware larger pre-seasoned cast iron skillets and they arrived in perfect condition. They also have longer handles which are more ergonomically designed so they are easier to use and never overheat.I love cast iron since it is so durable but it would have been too expensive to ship the Lodge skillet back for a replacement so I kept it the way it was. I will have to do the seasoning myself on it.I personally think that Farberware makes a better, more user friendly product and would recommend their cast iron products over Lodge."
2,Pan disappointment,"I wanted a medium sized cast iron frying pan. This one came highly recommended, and the price was right, so I ordered it. I have been using cast iron pans for the last 40 years, so I know how good they can be.This one is a HUGE disappointment. The cooking surface is NOT smooth at all, and that is causing the food to stick. I just love the way my other two cast iron pans function. They are as ""non-stick"" as a teflon pan. I was expecting the same results from this pan. I did season and cure the pan in the oven prior to the first use, so I don't think that is the problem here. My other two cast iron pans have a nice smooth cooking surface.Looks like I have to find what I want by looking through yard sales, as Lodge Logic appears to be the only remaining manufacturer of cast iron pans."
5,Great for Two,"This skillet by Lodge is perfect for two when frying or scrambling eggs. It's also great for baking small bathes of cornbread, cake, etc. I like this size also for frying apples for two. I love all my Lodge cast iron cookware and I'm sure if you give it a chance, you'll see why we cast iron users, prefer Lodge cast iron cookware over any other cookware available."
5,like this product,I chose this rating because it is a very good fry pan and bake pan. it cleans up easily and it is very solid.
5,the ULTIMATE cornbread skillet...,"so.. if you are baking ANYTHING with corn meal and don't use cast iron... (or specifically this skillet)... YOU ARE MISSING OUT... albeit this is a replacement pan for the one I lost 6 years ago.. which had a lot of good seasoning and baking history....just like with the pie pan, the eight inch skillet takes some baby-ing babieing?) {what's the correct nomenclature?} but.. with each batch of cornbread your skillet will get better and better and bett... and den?.... AND DEN?....... AND DEN?"
2,Found cheaper at Walmart,I bought this specifically for cooking eggs. I'm not a cook and didn't know what cast iron cooked like. I hate cooking in it because the eggs stick like crazy. Wife informed me i'm an idiot and she bought me a nice teflon pan for my eggs! i love that thing. THen the extra kick in the balls... I saw this at walmart for a dollar cheaper.If you know how to cook with this i'm sure it's an ok pan. I hate it and gave it away to someone.
1,Cracked,"When I opened the box, the first thing I saw was a big crack in the side. It looks like it might have cracked when it was being made, because the area around the crack was smoother and shinier than the rest of the skillet. Why would Lodge think Amazon would want a cracked skillet? Why would Amazon think I would want a cracked skillet?"
1,Not exactly pre-seasoned ...,Waste of money. Was supposedly pre-seasoned and ready for use. I added olive oil to the pan before trying to fry eggs. What a mess. couldn't turn the eggs. Ended up with fried egg scramble ... sorta.
1,Lodge 8-inch skillet - not as described,"This arrived with ""ridges"" on interior surface as if from burned particles, not like a pre-seasoned product. I have not been able to remove the ridges with scrubbing as have been recovering from surgery thus haven't used it but once.Most disappointed."
2,Cracked,"The pan arrived with a crack that runs through the metal from exterior to interior. It doesn't seem to leak, though, and it's great otherwise."
2,It sticks!,"This non-stick frypan really sticks, no matter I cooked fish or only tried to fry an egg. Besides, it's so heavy that I can hardly lift it by one hand."
2,Eventually rusts,"It was ok at first, though it was a little bit small.It started to rust on the inside some time ago, which I don't like at all. It's about 2 years old, but it's been rusting a little at a time for a while.I plan to buy a stainless steel skillet to replace it the next chance I get."
1,came damaged,There was a small chip on the edge. I could peel it off. About half-inch seasoning and coating came off. It's not like I'm buying this stuff from TJ Maxx or Marshall. I expected the full quality from Amazon store. But I received a defected one.
2,"so sad, it broke","The handle broke off when the pan was dropped! We purchased it last September, and today it's broken. It was my son's favorite pan. He learned to cook in it, and now it's broken."
1,Never ever buy this,In 1 week this fried pan got rusty. This is not what they promiced me when I bought it. Waste of money. Terrible
5,Just like it was done a hunnerd years ago,This really cooks things up good and really cleans up nice once you have used it several times. It seems like it gets better the more you use it.
1,Perhaps a recent decline in manufacturing quality?,"I bought both the 6.5"" and the 8"" pans this week. Have owned the 10"" for years and has served me well.The 6.5"" pan arrived with a significant chip on the surface of the lip, which had surprisingly already started to rust. Returned item.The 8"" pan arrived looking OK, but when put to first use (with eggs), not only did everything stick immediately, but it was impossible to clean--the egg seems to have permanently permeated the patina. So much so, that I'm not going to deal with it; it's also going back. Perhaps I should have seasoned the pan further before first use--but because it's advertised as ""pre-seasoned"" and there were no recommendations to do so, I felt comfortable cooking with it out of the box. It was a mistake, and now I have a ruined pan."
5,the busiest pan in my kitchen!,"I bought this with the Combo Cooker, 10.25"". This is perfect if you cook small each time, like my family with only two of us. Once you eat the fried eggs cooked with this pan, you won't be able to go back to other steel pans! It delivers the heat very quick once it's warmed up, so it requires close attention when you wanna make eggs over easy.I baked banana bread in this too. It was delicious and It was cooked very quick...!I'm looking forward to keeping those cast iron pans as long as I could!"
4,Hot and Heavy,It's a good sized skillet for a party of 2-3. Keeps food hot longer. Be careful if you've got glasses in the sink while trying to wash this thing!
5,Cast-iron Skillet---,"Only way to cook buttermilk bisquits. Yumm. Tried the other day, guess I lost my original pan, they just didn't cook good, so I went to Amazon...wham they were there."
3,camping,I don't think we really took the time to prepare the skillet the way its suppose to be. Everything got stuck to it.
4,"Good Pan, Good Price","I purchased this Lodge 8 inch skillet along with the 12 inch skillet. I am happy with my purchase. The pan seems to be very solid and cook evenly. I have only cooked a few things so far. First I cooked cornbread, it turned out amazing. I have also cooked some sausage and eggs, they also cooked well. The eggs stuck to the pan a little, but not a big deal. As I use the pans more I'm sure the seasoning will continue to build up and the pans will become more non-stick. But they were still easy to clean up, I just added some water in the pan for a few minutes and the food came right off, with a scrub brush. Good price on Amazon and free shipping is great. The pan should last a life time."
3,"Intriguing, but not convincing","An intriguing movie about an at first illogical step. This man does not convince me, but he does make you think. Would recommend for the sake of different perspectives of history and simply because the man is different (and torn)."
3,Interesting insight in the DPRK,"After visiting DPRK in the beginning of 2008 I wanted to see and learn more about this country. I enjoyed this documentary and it leaves you with questions on what is the truth and what really happened. I think we will never know, but this film is definitely worth watching."
4,adventure of a misfit in a misunderstood country,the story telling is excellent. but it's still a whitewash of all the suffering the koreans and chinese have undergone at the hands of a militarily powerful brat.
4,A Small Life,"The documentary was better than I expected. But to sum up the entire film, it's about a man that lives a terrible childhood, has an even worse adulthood, and makes a run for what he figures is ""safety.""He probably lived a better life as a turn coat. But only because that is what he was. A hero in the twisted place they call the People's Republic of North Korea. A wife and two sons that are treated like the landed elite. What more can one ask for?Communist living obviously took it's toll on him. Little things like the gold teeth. And the way he smokes his cigarettes down to the filter. And he would presumably live off the best life had to offer in NORK. One can only pitty the poor souls that failed to shed enough tears when 'Dear Leader' departed the living.Slater did a good job as narrator."
3,It's okay,This DVD is about Lil Kim and Puffy and what they did a year after Biggie was killed. Nothing really on Biggie
4,"Good movie, shows a lot of heart.","We watched this movie last night, I really liked it. I remember when he was killed, very tragic senseless murder of a talented young man. The movie covers his brief life well. BIGs music will always be around. I really recommend this movie."
4,IT IS WHAT IT IS,Well put togather. and at the end of the day some are not keeping it gangsta watch the dvd you can get insite on who and other things that never been said about jm thumbs up rock
5,Great under water scenes,This for a real James Bond fan was Sean Connery's favorite movie. That is why he did the re make as Never Say Never Again.
3,Average Restoration,"This soundtrack re-mastering is a bit of a disappointment. I like the gun barrel opening but some of the editing of the cuts isn't very good. The sound quality is below standard. If you listen to GOLDFINGER or even DR. NO these sound much better. Also, there is still quite a bit of music not presented on this CD. YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and LIVE AND LET DIE re-mastered soundtracks contain almost every musical cut. Also, the vocal version of MR. KISS KISS BANG BANG is not included. I was disappointed yet happy to get music that was left off the original LP."
4,Seems to work pretty well.,We bought this product for our nursery to remove odors from the diaper pale and it does make a difference. It is pretty big so if I had to do it over again I would probably bought a smaller size if I could.
3,"DVD has only one video in the league of ""Spacewalk""","This DVD has 9 videos each 4 to 5 minutes long. All videos are primarily visual effects set to the motion of instrumental music (music comes from the 64-95 album).5 of the videos are ambients: Come Down On Me, Only Time, Don't Stop Now, Stay With You, and The Slow Train.There are 3 two-dimensional cartoon-like videos: Make Things Right, The Shouty Track, and A Man Like Me.And, there is one high-quality-production three-dimensional video: Go.You will be disappointed if you are expecting videos like Spacewalk or Nice Weather For Ducks -- the only video in that category is ""Go""."
2,"An album of filler to accompany ""Go""","This album was thoroughly disappointing for me, with the sole exception of ""Go"". As other reviewers have noted, this album feels utterly uninspired and mechanical, as though Lemon Jelly really wanted to release ""Go"" as something other than a single and thus cobbled together a bunch of random dreck they could pass off as songs. Although the hallmark of Lemon Jelly's pieces is repetition, this is the first album that actually sounds repetitive. Looped samples are laid over one another in ways that, rather than complimenting each other, clash in disturbingly arhythmic fashions. There is no hint of the building harmonies and complicated syncopations present in their earlier works.All in all, I hope Lemon Jelly decide to return to their former, quirky selves in the future. This album is not representative of their talent or creativity."
1,disappointed ex-fan,"This album is rubbish. Gone is the wit, the fun, the music, the enjoyment, the soul. There's nothing to this - it's bland bland bland instant-flash-animation-library-music- don't waste your money. Clearly they spent too much creative energy on the (very average) animation and overblown packaging."
3,Save Your Money,"I wanted to like this, I really did; because I like the previousLemon Jelly CDs...but this CD just seems uninspired to me.Ironically, the best track is the last track: GO, with WilliamShatner vocals...though his voice is manipulated so if you didn'talready know it was Shatner, you might not guess it.The rest of the CD has moments, I suppose, but too many times becomes unforgivably tedious, the worst example of this being the""Don't Stop Now"" song. Yes it sounds cool to hear a sexy womansay ""Don't Stop Now,"" a couple of times, but those three wordsloop for the entire song...I challenge anyone to count howmany times they loop ""don't stop now"" without falling asleepor skipping to the next song. So I'd advise all who, because theylove previous L.J. CDs and are intrigued by this new release...SAVE YOUR MONEY."
3,The Wonderful Music of Nancy Galbraith Poorly Performed,"I find the music of Nancy Galbraith to be very energetic, lyrical and quite engaging. Her wind works are dreadfully under played and quite misunderstood by those who have recorded them. This recording of her Wind Symphony No.1 formerly titled ""If Rachel In A Yellow Rose"" is remarkably flawed. I am astounded that the record label released such a low quality rendition of this prominent composer's music. Parts are missing or misplayed; the tone quality of many sections in the ensemble is vastly immature so as to render the recording not even worthy of being a reference let alone definitive. I truly hope finer ensembles will take on the project of recording Nancy Galbraith's excellent wind music in the future."
1,Blah Blah Blah,Ponderous discourse on meaningless abstractions.I can't believe that anyone would have a single good word to say about this waste of paper unless of course that person is a good friend of the author.
1,Simply Horrible,"A religious rant of hatred against women dressed up in the most outlandish pseudo-science imaginable.The central premise of Mr. Willke's book is the delusional fantasy that women cannot become pregnant after being raped. To call him a doctor would be laughable, were he not so dedicated to promoting ignorance and disinformation. Worse yet, some Republican politicians have chosen to embrace the views of this book in encouraging and enabling violence against women.The agenda of defining categories of ""legitimate rape"" versus ""illegitimate rape"" against women seems almost unimaginable in the modern world, but Mr. Willke's book provides a world view of women that are little more than dumb breeding animals.In Mr. Willke's warped view, rape is the natural outcome of women's nature. If a pregnancy results from such a rape, she obviously wanted and deserved it. Therefore, she deserves the punishment of pregnancy and childbirth in addition to rape."
1,"Liar, Liar Pants on Fire!","A completely disgusting book written by a completely disgusting misogynist. All thoroughly disproven. ""Dr"" Wilke is the only physician who espouses this ridiculous nonesense. At least we now know who wingnuts are citing when they babble about ""new research shows"". This man is pure evil."
4,An excellent reference book.,"Abortion: Questions and Anwers is unlikely to sway a prochoicer to the prolife side. However, for the prolifer it is a valuable resource. The style is frank and straightforward, and abundant references are provided for further study. This book is a must-buy for those on the prolife side of the abortion battle. For those in the middle, it is an excellent summary of prolife philosophy and the data that supports that philosophy. For the prochoice, it is a thought-provoking challenge. Add it to your library today."
5,Playful and Educational Album,"This album is a beautiful listen, but it is especially worthwhile, if you play the recorder yourself. Michala Petri makes a wonderful display of her technical mastery of the recorder, which sports different blowing techniques. I myself keep coming back to this album for technical inspiration. This is Michala Petri's 18th CD and it originally came out back in 1988. More than 20 years have passed since then, but it is still a fresh and vibrant album."
3,"Slow, Slow, Slow","This could have been a pretty good mystery and suspense story, BUT, it is written in the third person which automatically places you at distance from the story. More like a report from someone else. I have only read one other book written in the third person and I am a 4 book a week reader. Why anyone would write in the third person is beyond me. I hope I don't ever come upon another!"
4,Dung eater,"This is a little off-beat gem as it deals with all of the dark issues about the mob but never in a heart attack manner. It is a comedy & to my mind better written that a lot of them. A good cast plus a good plot equals a better than you think movie.Dennis Hopper is the low man in his family & why not. He's stuck in the past with his clothes, his music, and his ideals (there you go ideals from a gangster). Of course his ideals include Darryl Hannah who is his heart throb besides being the local porn actress. Hey honey nice dress! They even wrote the script so her Swedish co-star gets the laughs. Any how Frankie is serious about moving up in the world if only his boss would notice. His Boss (Michael Madsen) notices all right & prepares Frankie's daily meals of s**t.This isn't the Godfather or Thief. It is the Godfather on gas. A funny quirky story, with a bit of heart in it. Think of a more serious 8 Heads in a Duffle Bag.I laughed a lot. 4 Stars."
3,meh,"First of all what is with this cover? Did they steal pictures from the casts other movies and take particular care to make sure they don't actually look anything like they characters they're portraying. that is a pic of Kiefer from Truth or Consequences, someone effed up! Anyhoo... I thought it was fun to see Dennis Hopper as this little peon, someone who isn't tuff or in control. I liked watching Kiefer play this annoying irrisponsible porn directer. He played a character I'd never seen before and I enjoyed watching that. The movie itself left a lot to be desired but it wasn't a total loss. A great way to waste 2 hours at least"
2,The soundtrack was nice.,The only thing I like about this movies was the soundtrack. I expected more from this move with the actors that was in it.
2,"The idea was good, but it could have been better.","I initially rented this movie because Kiefer Sutherland is in it, and I am a big Kiefer Sutherland fan. I was pleasantly surprised by the appearances of Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper.While, the acting, I thought, was good, it was the screenplay/storyline that wasn't. I can feel this build up, but the movie never climaxed for me. It just built me up and then didn't really go anywhere with it.I don't blame the actors for this, as I think everyone really was good, it was just wasn't done as well as it could have been."
3,"Love Art Nouveau, but this deck is just OK","I love the art on this deck. It's absolutely beautiful. The cards themselves, though...they're a little short on symbolism for my taste. I wouldn't mind having the full-size, because it's possible that part of my issue is that the cards are so small that I'm missing details. But I just can't connect with this, no matter how hard I try. Matt Myers' out-of-print Art Nouveau deck from US Games is a much better fit for me."
4,Excellent Book by Suzy Spencer,Suzy Spencer is a great true murder author. The realism this book gives the reader true insight on how the investigation and murder really happend.
2,Not really a story,"This book was pretty awful. I only say that because it was not a story - it was a bunch of occurrences just thrown together on pages. There was absolutely no discernable storyline. what a shame, because it could have been interesting. The way everything was thrown together came off as an attempt to create something, but what, I don't know. HORRIBLE. Completely not recommended. Suzy Spencer did her readers a terrible injustice - it was like she compiled it from a bunch of newspaper clippings."
2,Hard Reading Material a SNOOOOZE,This book was very informative but it lacked something i cant put my finger on. I feel that she dident give enough detials to the childhoods of the perpatraors and that she dident really let us know what the real regina was like the story was lacking a personal touch that apparently the auther dident have with her subject. But the story line was good and the out come tragic but unevidable...
5,Great read!,"Spencer's book is extremely compelling. I literally could not put it down! Great story, great characters, and sharp writing make this a must-read."
1,A difficult read,"The story was good, the characters were real with no need to embellish, but the book was really difficult to read. The writing could have been better as it needed to be to tell this great story and all the dynamics that led to the untimely death of Regina Hartwell. If you can muddle through the switching of character names, ei: from Kim to Leblanc, within sentences of each other then give it a go, otherwise plan on rereading pages to try to make sense of an out of control ""train"" of thought."
4,Latin Roots Rock,"This rockin', solid release from Vallejo continues to show their evolution and polished sound. They address more of their heritage in the lyrics and in the music. Almost every song has a Latin beat in it. ""Take a Ride"" is a hook-filled attention grabber. ""Rock Americano"" will catch in your head and leave you singing that you are ""Half-American, half-chicano"" even if you're a WASP like me. ""Vices"" is a ""if it feels good do it"" song, and it feels good. All the tracks are solid, but you must hear ""So Damn Beautiful"". By the time I got to the remake of ""Mexican Radio"" (Radio DJs take note, you should play this one), I was sorry the the album was over. I'm just hoping that A.J., Alejandro, Omar and the boys finally get the national air play they deserve this time. 5-star releases from Vallejo: Vallejo (self-titled), A Beautiful Life. 4-star releases: Into the New, Sins (1st album)."
4,Norpro Meat pounder,"The pounder is weighted well, is easily handled, flattens meat as it is supposed to, and being metal so can be easily sterilized and is reasonably priced."
5,Best pounder I have owned,"Chef's Illustrated gave this pounder high marks and I bought it on their recommendation. I'm glad I did, it easily makes short work of thick cuts and is so much easier to use than the straight handle versions. The heavy weight cuts down on the need to slam it down on the cut and the offset grip keeps your hand off the counter. Yes, it isn't the cheapest one, but you are only going to buy it once."
5,Works great,"I purchased two, one for me and then my daughter. It works the best out of several meat pounders I've used without tearing the meat. It has the right weight and size to perfectly pound chicken breasts, veal, etc."
5,Great Chicken Pounder,We purchased this item to refine our chicken cutlet techniques. This has got to be the best little tool to flatten out chicken cutlets. With hardly any effort we can now get them very thin and even. The weight and feel is perfect and the finish and balance is very nice. It has a high polished look and matches our All Clad set. We're very happy with this product.
1,??Recommended by Cooks Illustrated??,"This item is reviewed in Cooks Illustrated and ""recommended with reservations"". I don't think this should show up on a product listing as ""recommended""! Until I checked their website, I thought it meant that this was the one that came out on top.""When pitted against heavier models, the flaws of this offset-handled pounder became apparent. Shorter testers, pounding at a less optimal angle, found that the heel of the disk often dug into and tore the meat."""
3,"Pounds meat, if you have kerosene","To be honest, this is a fine meat pounder. But my pet peeve happens to be bad stickers.This one in particular had a nice white sticker on the top of the pounder, nice and visible telling you it's NOT made in America by NorPro. A quick nudge with the fingernail showed it was a great sticker, one that would nicely sop up meat juices and not peel off without shredding. So up we went the scale of sticker treatments.Razor blade scrape left lots of residue.Hot water and soap did not remove it.Alcohol swabs did not remove it.(Was out of WD40 today)Kerosene was required. A lot of it.Now normally I take joy in my use of solvents. But in the case of something that comes in contact with my meats (even if it does just rinse off clean), I prefer to keep jet fuel out of my kitchen."
1,Poorly finished,"Although this meat pounder has been highly rated by Cooks Illustrated I found it to be poorly finished.It is well designed, just a poor quality implimentation."
1,Strange and Awkward Design. Other designs are a lot better.,"This design is so strange and awkward. It's like something between the ""hammer"" design and the straight pounder design. I think it's very ineffective. Yes, because it has a flat ""pounder"", it will pound to an extent...but no where near the other two designs. Read my reviews on the other designs to formulate your own opinion, but I don't think this meat pounder was designed well at all. It would be more difficult to clean and store. It does not work well for the ""down and out"" motion necessary for proper meat pounding."
4,Very handy,"This product was rated highly in Cook's Illustrated. I haved used it once on a whole butterflied chicken and it worked as expected. After my purchase , the price went down considerable."
4,A much appreciated improvement over the standard method.,"Until I discovered this tool, I had to pound my meat by hand. When preparing your meat for a party, this easily leads to callouses. Thankfully, with the Norpro Meat Pounder, I can pound my meat all I want without undesired difficulties of the old school method. Ladies or those with small hands or arms may also appreciate the added weight and leverage this gives to increase the capacity of their meat pounding (not to mention, clean-up could not be easier).I'm not sure if there is an automated solution available, but until I find an automated meat pounder, this simple product will definitely take care of all my pounding needs.If you do a lot of meat pounding by hand, I would recommend the Norpro Meat Pounder without hesitation.This would also make a great gift."
2,Overwritten and predicatable,"I am partial to books set in East Africa and am not immune to the pleasures of a mystery, but this book was disappointing. The premise does not hold water - the plot is based on the formulaic opening scene where the protagonist's perhaps-lover crashes his plane in a dogfight and with his last breath binds our heroine to search for his long-lost brother. As the trail leads to Kenya we are introduced to many two-dimensional characters who speak in unnatural and stereotyped dialogue and confront tribal mysteries that unlike in Alexander McCall Smith, for example, do not bring us even an enlightened white person's understanding of the complex sociology of African cultures. I would give this book a pass."
4,Mark of the Lion,"Jade, with her inexorable personality, gets away with murder. In other words, Ms. Del Cameron challenges men in the book in ways that few women did during the time period of the story. Even more exciting, if you're not careful, you might you eaten by a lion- Jade takes you on a safari. Furthermore, the story gets the reader so close to the action that you can see the claws of lion clutching at your throat."
4,The African Savannah and the supernatural,"I expected ""Out of Africa"" with a bit of mystery thrown in but I was surprised. I appreciated the period setting. I genuinely felt like I was a British ex-partiot after WWI, although the characters, including the heroine, are somewhat broadly drawn. The supernatural touches of the shape-shifters are what surprised me. I like mysteries with a touch of SF but it seemed out of place here. But most of all, the actual solving of the mystery was not that difficult - I knew half the answer a third of the way into the book. And I rarely guess ""whodunnit""."
3,Hard to read a contemporary book that applauds hunting game so strongly,"Even though this book is supposed to be about the years just after World War I, it's hard to read about how much fun it is to shoot game to produced mounted heads for wall decoration. Jade doesn't seem to flinch at all about slaughtering animals. I don't think that's anything to admire her for. That was a big mark against the book for me."
2,NOT A GOOD PAN LIKE OLDER CAST IRON - VERY COURSE INSIDE,"Very disappointed with the quality (or lack of) with this pan. The inside of the pan is VERY course making it very hard to fry eggs or many other foods.If the would surface the inside of it, it would be very good like older pans. This pan is quick and dirty making the quality poor."
1,questionable quality,"The item is of very poor quality: little holes, cracks, bumps are everywhere! I then went to a local Wal-Mart and saw some 10.25"" Lodge Logic skillets and they're of much higher quality. So when we buy them online and cannot inspect them, they just send us the ones of the worst quality!!! Think twice before you buy online!"
2,Good if you don't mind sticking food,"I'm a huge fan of cast iron. Unfortunately, Lodge could be a lot better than it is. I bought this pan and have stuck it in the back of the closet, never to be used. Lodge makes their products with a gritty, rough surface. This causes foods like eggs and anything with a sauce to get stuck in the muck. There is no reason for this. I grew up with a father who collected old Griswald cast iron pans. They are the ideal pan. They are super smooth on the interior. Several friends who have seen or used my pans have commented how they think it is coated with teflon, but it's not. Buy yourself a good Griswald pan on eBay. After each use, wipe it out with a paper towel and leave it alone. Nothing will ever stick to the Griswald unless you REALLY try. Trust me, you will be much happier than you will be with this pan. I now have a nice collection of Griswald pans."
5,"Light Weight, Perfect for Two","This is a wonderful skillet from Lodge that is perfect for two people. It will accommodate a couple of small steaks or a couple of hamburgers or a few eggs, etc. I noticed the difference in the weight, immediately. It is lighter in weight than Lodge's average skillets of same size. Yes, it still has some heaviness to it but much lighter by far. This is going to be the skillet that stays on my stove because I know already I will be using it most every day. It's especially great when cooking for one or two people. By the way, I read here so often about not using soap to wash your cast iron. You absolutely can use dish soap to wash your cast iron and it really will not hurt it at all. I grew up with cast iron and I use it myself all my life. I do use dish soap on my cast iron from time to time. Just remember, if you wash your cast iron in dish detergent, to heat the skillet dry and grease it up real good."
5,"Best, Best, BEST!!","This is the most incredible skillet I have EVER used! I use it every single day to cook for my large family.Can't believe I 'fell' for the teflon-type or anodized skillets; I was purchasing a new one every 2 or 3 years as they do not stand up to daily use. The one improvement we made to both our 15-1/4 and 10-1/4 inch Cast-iron Skillets was to subject them to some serious sanding with our orbital sander. We started with 80 grit and worked up to 220 grit - took more than an hour, but boy was it worth it! The pan finish is now like glass and is 100% stick free!"
1,Extremely rough cooking surface,"This frying pan was unbelievably bad. The cooking surface was rougher than most cast iron utensils are on the outside. Even their website had the following:""My new Lodge Cast Iron pan feels rough in some areas, is this normal?""""Yes. With use and replenishment of the seasoning, the pan will become smoother. Unlike other types of cookware, Lodge Cast Iron only gets better with use. For concerns about roughness, it is OK to use a fine grade of sandpaper to smooth out the rough areas. Make sure to re-season the item before using.""I tried a medium grade of sandpaper and got nowhere with this. Very glad for Amazon's returns policy."
5,In LOVE,"I have been in the market for a cast iron skillet for a long time, finally found this one on amazon for a great price.... first few meals came out perfectly browned (potato, steak and chicken dishes). Great quality thus far. Love this skillet!"
4,Good quality - good value for price,"I got the pan to cut out the cycle of buying a new nonstick skillet every year (a 10"" skillet is my major pan/every day use and the best only last a year)Some basic observations:1. the uninsulated handle is a bit of a pain to work with (and it's kind of short)2. the pan works better with additional seasoning - I'd suggest this out of the ""box"" - continued use and proper cleaning will increase the non-stick3. believe the cleaning recommendations - heavy soap will distroy the ""non-stick"" effectAlso to reduce sticking, try starting with lower heat settings.I'm pleased with the purchase."
4,Works as advertised,"I bought the 8"" and 10"" skillets ,followed the instructions for keeping them in proper condition and really don't have anything to complain about, cooks everything great. Just remember to use a pot holder or oven mitt when grabbing the handle cause its HOT"
4,Heavy duty skillet,"Four stars, not five, as the skillet isn't even close to non-stick straight out of the box. I first attempted pancakes in it. Mistake! They stuck like glue despite adding oil first. However, it heats evenly and holds heat well and did a great job with the beans for my rice & beans dish. My daughter has used it to fry tofu and other things. Hopefully as I use it more and it becomes more seasoned, it will still be great for those pancakes and even the occasional fried egg. I like the double handles, as it's heavy and would be awkward with just one. Oh, works perfect on my ceramic cooktop, too!"
5,Easy reading is hard writing!,Leaves Of Chestnut Ridge is brilliantly written. Filled with wonderful detail... you KNOW the characters.
2,Tries too hard and way too much ....,"I read all the rave reviews about this book and was very excited at the prospect of a great weekend read. Instead, I thought it was a book that tried way too hard to be off beat and funny. There were so very many characters, many of them sketchy at best, and the organization of events was very jumpy. I was not at all pleased to have wasted my 11.95 on this one."
5,Readers are the lucky ones,"My only regret is that this extremely entertaining novel had to end. Canter skillfully weaves memorable and honest characters into a matrix of compelling events, which flow across intersecting time lines. If you have been around long enough to, despite your best efforts, be swept up in circumstances beyond your control, this engaging book will shed a bright light on how to keep smiling through it all. It is difficult to put this book down, with its funhouse mirror reflection on how we deal with the turmoil in our lives. If you are lucky enough, you will read this book and learn how to use a sense of humor through it all."
4,KO KO MO,"GENE AND EUNICE WERE A MALE-FEMALE VOCAL R&B DUO FROM LOS ANGELES IN THE 1950'S. THEY WERE VERY POPULAR OUT THERE, THEY MOSTLY WROTE THEIR OWN SONGS, AND HAD THEIR OWN LOCAL T.V. SHOW (ONE OF THE VERY FIRST SHOWS HOSTED BY AFRICAN AMERICANS). THERE WERE OTHER MALE-FEMALE VOCAL DUOS AROUND AT THAT TIME (CHARLES AND YNEZ FOX, MICKEY AND SYLVIA, IKE AND TINA TURNER, ETC) BUT GENE AND EUNICE HAD THEIR OWN SOUND, A BIT MORE POLISHED WITH LESS EDGE TO IT. BUT THEY HARMONIZE WELL, THE SONGS SOUND NICE, AND THIS CD IS LONG OVERDUE."
5,Don't believe any bad stuff about the book.,Don't believe any of this negative garbage people have been writing about this book. It's a helpful book.
1,"Trite, ILL Advised, Simplistic, Attitudinal..Save your $$$","This book is awful. Marinakis' view of things is simplistic, trite and extraordinarily condescending. I doubt she has any children of her own, because if she did clearly she would not create such useless, impractical pulp. Just another example of a ivory tower idiot dispensing advice about which she knows nothing. A lambskin on the wall qualifies her for a frame...but certainly not for her ability to assist parents with their children. It reads like everyone is stupid...poor..and without good sense. Save your money...This book should be called ""My attitude will drive you nuts""..stay sane..save money...stay away!!"
5,Inspired Dark Comedy,"Boy do the reactions to this film run the gamut!!! Reading the negative responses of some to the flick you would think it was a reincarnation of ""Freddie Got Fingered"". In my mind it harkens back to the askewed humor of ""Bad Santa"". Give kudos to director Jody Hill for pushing the envelope and challenging the audience. The central character, Ronnie(Seth Rogen), is a self-delusional manic depressive prone to violence. Rogen, whose star rises with each movie, injects just the right amount of empathy in Ronnie to make him palatable. Anna Faris goes against type in playing an unlikable cosmetics girl but it is no less an inspired turn on her part. The laugh quotient is high if your personal taste allows. I would recommend this flick to some but others beware."
4,this is a great movie,"great movie , not for a stuck up mormon type though.dennis the mexican is a great charachter , my favorite part of the movie is at the end when hes reading the post card from him.... u can buy this used with cheap shipping... im adding it to my collection of blu ray.... getting tired of dvds they are going out of style"
2,Really glad I rented this......,"... Instead of buying it. This movie was not even remotely funny. It was entirely predictable, and honestly it was actually depressing. I can't comment on the extras because I disliked this movie so much that I couldn't bring myself to even see if there were any. Just really really bad."
4,Very Funny!!!,This movie had some incredibly funny moments if you love dark comedy. It's kind of like a dirtier version of 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop' Seth Rogen stars as a mall security guard named Ronnie Barnhardt who is on a mission to stop a flasher by any means necessary. He even goes undercover as a shopper. I highly recommend OBSERVE AND REPORT!!!
3,Beware of the digital copy--- for PCs only,"The movie is okay, as far at the movie goes it's a very dark comedy.I feel I must warn those buying this blu-ray with digital copy that the digital copy is for use on PCs only. So, if you use a MAC, as I do, you are outta luck when it comes to the digital copy.I hope this helps.The Anna Faris scenes are all hysterical by the way, and the blu-ray video quality, I believe is impeccable."
1,What Happened Here?,"Look, I like pretty much each of these actors in something else, ranging from Good Fellas to Scary Movie. I even liked ""Funny People"" and I am told I'm totally alone on that one.But this just didn't have anything redeeming to it. I prayed it was just off to a slow start for two hours. It never delivered.Oh there were jokes. There were things intended to be shocking. But everything had been done better somewhere else.If a film is going to be dark comedy, then it has to be funny. If not, then you end up wondering what you just saw. It looks accidental, or like everyone is just phoning it in, from writers to featured extras."
1,Stupid piece of GARBAGE,"This is the stupidest piece of rubbish I've sat through in a very long time. All of the (very few) funny parts were in the trailer, and when placed in the context of the movie, aren't funny anymore, just sad. This movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be, funny, gross, bleak, sad; it was just all over the place. Hated it."
1,A depressing comedy?,"I had high expectations for an hour and a half comedy romp. What was to be a romantic/slapstick comedy turned out to be repeated bouts of sadly disturbing violence caused by a psychological disturbed, middle aged, go-nowhere man. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Strange movie and actually not very funny,"I thought this movie was going to be really funny. Come to find out it wasnt. Now that I've seen quite a few of his movies, I'm realizing I'm not really a fan of Seth Rogen. He's just not very funny. He's pretty obnoxious actually, especially in this movie. I'm not sure if it's him or just the character he's playing. But his character was actually pretty realistic and everyone probably has known or seen someone like that in real life. Just a really stupid person, annoying, obnoxious, delusional person. But it doesnt necessarily make for the best movie. It's not horrible, but not as good as I expected. I dont know if I would consider this a comedy or what. It's kind of just there."
3,Digital copy was expired...,"I like this movie but when I tried to use the digital copy, it was expired. Guess it was my fault not to look but I have not encountered this problem until now... Anyways, the movie is a good dark comedy and unlike most Jody Hill endeavors, this has a more Hollywoodesque ending."
2,The description on the back of the DVD looked good...,"I picked this up on Black Friday at Walmart for $1.96 and I'm glad that's all I paid for it. We did laugh quite a few times during the movie, I must say, but it was mostly the type of laughter that is brought on by the feeling of ""I can't believe I'm seeing/hearing this. How crazy is this? Wow. Is this seriously a real movie?"" If all movies were like this one, it wouldn't take too long before I stopped watching movies altogether. Thankfully it isn't so. And thankfully the movie is only 86 minutes long. I came away with some funny moments to remember, but I'd say I would take my $2 back if I could."
1,Observe and Recoil,"The creators made the characters absurdly egomaniacal and psychotic in hopes that audiences would have no choice but to laugh. This schtick which worked to perfection for J. Hill in Eastbound & Down got tiring around the 15-minute mark of Observe and Report. The film was meant to be quirky, but there's a fine line between quirky and irritating. The humor is so ridiculous that it makes Leslie Nielsen movies seem sophisticated. The only times I laughed was when the mall streaker zipped by....that's because he resembled Michael Moore."
4,Observe & Report,"The movie has been oft criticized. That's because people walked into the cinemas expecting Pineapple Express 2. The movie is definitely funny, but is not the stereotypical comedy that Rogen has been in. For the first time he plays an actual character and people want to crucify him."
2,I really wanted to like this one.....,"I really went into this movie thinking it was going to be just so-so. When I finally got around to watching it I made sure I watched it with a bunch of friends because lets face it, funny movies are better when watching with a bunch of friends. But this movie did not make us laugh. It just wasn't that funny to me. I gave it two stars becuase at least it had a couple funny parts. Also, the twin brothers were pretty rad.Just rent this one if you want to see this movie. Not a good buy..."
3,Needs better observation,"I really wanted to love this movie, I mean Superbad is one of my favorite movies of all time. This is not, also I cannot blame Seth Rogen because he neither wrote or directed this and it shows. There were extremely funny parts (the actual naked chase through the mall, his mom, and the crossroad beatdown) but everything else sucked. I think that whomever wrote this banked too much how much Seth Rogen is liked and didn't spend enough time on the script."
1,Very Very dissapointing,"This movie was so dissapointing, I didn't like this movie at all. I thought it would be flat out hilarious because it's Seth Rogen for god's sake. If you seen the previews, you would think that Seth Rogen would play his usual dumb character. But he doesn't , instead he plays a dumb security guard who is a borderline psychopath with bipolar disorder. This was too dark of a comedy, definitely not the kind of role I'm use to seeing Seth Rogen play. Not a good movie at all."
1,Seth Rogen letdown *Spoiler Alert*,"Being a Seth Rogen fan, I found this movie not very good. The trailer for it seemed promising.Making light of manic depression to me is not funny and you end up feeling bad for the main character because of his illness. There are very few laughs to be had. He suffers from delusions of grandeur and thinks get worse once he stops taking his medication.The ending of the movie is questionable bad taste with a mentally ill man shooting a flasher and being hailed as a hero.I would recommend Knocked Up, Super Bad, Pineapple Express but I would not this one."
1,Juvenile,"This is a really, really bad movie. Packed with juvenile humour, humiliating manic depressive dialog and drunken nonsence. If you can help it, skip this movie or else you will be wasting your time."
1,DARK HUMORED BUT STILL NOT WORTH IT,i like dark humored movies ... this was .. and stil suckedstupid musicstupid actingrediculous amount of over used scenesand the main character was way too serious .. not in a funny way more like when does this guy shut up way
1,Terrible movie,"This movie was awful and a waiste of time.I dig most other Seth Rogen flicks, but this sucked, plain and simple."
1,Its like a dirty version of Mall Cop,"I got very annoyed with this movie. Seth Rogen was just plain annoying throughout the whole movie. Im starting to notice that he is annoying in all of his movies. I see why this movie bombed in theaters. Some parts were funny, but most of it was boring. Every other word throughout the whole movie was the F word. I feel dumber after watching it. Save your money and watch Mall Cop."
2,Mall Cop was better...,"Seth Rogan is hit or miss with me. This movie just seems like another typical exploitive ripoff. Any humor is borrowed at best. Just watch Paul Blart instead. It's a better movie and more original.Also, it should be mentioned this movie must have been literally going for the record on the F bomb. The word is used twice in every other sentence, and I am not exaggerating. This is typical of the whole movie. If you like your humor at its cheapest then perhaps this is for you. For me, it was just a distraction and worst of all, not funny."
1,"PLEASE RENT, NOT BUY","plain and simple, this movie is terrible. the people that have given it 4, and 5 stars are the ones who are brainwashed into thinking everything any comedian does is good....granted KNOCKED UP and SUPERBAD was amazing. I loved both, simply classics. But this is by far the worst piece of trash my eyes have ever seen. Funny parts, here and there, but in general too much cussing for no reason, just a flat out terrible movie.i can assure you...if you buy this...it will come back to haunt you."
2,Seth Rogen finally over?,"Ok, I absolutely didn't hate this movie. It was pretty much what I expected. But, I've found most of Rogen's movies to be subpar. He's a likeable oaf but not enough to carry a movie. His best performances were his smaller roles in Superbad and Fanboys. The guy literally has no screen presence. We all know Hollywood is grasping at straws these days. This is just another example."
2,Had potential but Rogen can't carry it alone,"I didn't think the movie was that great, it had a lot of potential and could have been great if it co-starred another member of the poor players guild (Segel, Rudd, Jonah, or Baruchel). It has its moments but this is one of the worst movies I've seen Rogen in. Worth a rental if you're curious, but hardly ownable."
1,Sucked monkey b**ls,"I couldn't even watch half of the movie and turned it off after the hot blonde girl from the Bunny movie got flashed. Not sure if I was even halfway through at that point.Swearing is ok by me, but when you use it in every other word without trying to make a point. It's just plain annoying.This movie is also one of those ""volume"" movies that exercises your entertainment surround sound. Where you need to turn up the volume to hear them talk, but all of a sudden some loud music or noise out of nowhere will make you reach for your remote to turn it down. It seemed to be a constant during the first half of the movie. That is probably more annoying than the swearing.The script also didn't help any. Unless you are a true Seth Rogen fan. I would skip. Even he can't save this movie."
2,Been done sooo many times before...,I dont know how anyone can say this is good. Im not even done watching it yet but I already know whats going to happen. I could write this movie. Idiot wants the hotter mean girl but doesnt realise the ugly duckling. I havent gotten to the end yet but Im pretty sure he ends up with the coffee girl (ugly duckling). The downhill montage was kinda funny. I laughed a little bit a couple times. The F Bomb was dropped a few times too many. Ide say watch this movie if you're that bored. Not that good.
1,this sucked,"don't waste your time. just NOT funny. more and more, seth rogan is proving to me that he's just not much of a comedic actor and certainly can't carry a movie. this flick was just painful to watch. a complete bomb...and not in a good way."
1,Probably one of the worst movies I've ever watched,"Simply put, it just isn't a good movie. Don't watch it. But if you feel some compelling need to find out how bad it is, rent instead of buying and wait until it is a $.99 rental or something cheap."
1,DO NOT BUY BLURAY DISKS FROM THIS SOURCE,I was very dissapointed to find the blu-ray disk with the digital copy included had an expiration date of April 2010 when I tried to download onto my computer. I would recommend buying from a reputable store so the digital copy you get has a current (not expired) expiration date.
1,How did this movie ever get made?,"This movie doesn't deserve the one star I gave it! Some folks label this as a ""dark comedy"" and it didn't deliver on any level. How the director / writer convinced anyone to finance this movie should give hope to anyone who has dreams of making movies, because you obviously don't need any talent. How did she get some good actors? Are they that desperate for work?"
2,Adequate,"I bought a pair because I owned a previous version of the Kumasi. This one's a step down in construction, fit and materials."
1,Bad Reflection,"Having heard Lisa Gerrard's inspired work on the Gladiator soundtrack, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of my copy of Mirror Pool. What a total disappointment. Evidently, Hans Zimmer did all the writing for Gladiator and just told Gerrard what to sing. Mirror Pool is one of the most pretentiously unmusical pieces of New Age claptrap ever perpetrated on the listening public. It sounds like PMS opera on barbituates, composed and performed by someone who has spent far too many semesters in music school studying theory and technique without ever once having been struck by a single original or interesting musical idea. The ""percussionists"" on this session should never again be allowed to touch a drum, as they have no sense of rhythm and no respect for the instruments they're abusing. Mirror Pool is a waste of perfectly good plastic. Lisa, don't quit your day job!"
3,About the new songs,"First, let me tell that songs like Sanvean are not new, they are past works made with the group Dead Can Dance, and I agree that they are so beautiful and moving they swept you to other worlds. But the rest of the CD is a real disappointment for the incredible talent of Lisa, they do not stand out from the inmense crowd out there. The song I liked the most was number fifteen, and Lisa don't even sing in it. I don't now what happened. Three stars because, well, is good music, only not the level I expected."
2,This isn't Dead Can Dance,"I don't plan to wax poetic on Lisa Gerrard's exquisite voice, considering how other reviewers have quite beat me to it; I will say that the music is indeed slower, almost monotonic compared to the work Lisa did with Brendan Perry in Dead Can Dance. Her voice is what redeems this album. She sings with power, and has not really chosen music that matches that power. Some tracks do indeed live up to her potential, but many do not. One suspects that she and Perry drove each other to work harder and produce far better music than either might have done alone. But if this is your first exposure to Lisa Gerrard, check out any and all of the music she did with Brendan Perry. You will certainly hear her qumys-strong voice but to excellent use."
1,Disappointing,I love Lisa Gerrard's voice and her music on some soundtracks is fantastic. But this album is just WEIRD!!
1,Not To My Liking,"Ummm... Wow. ""Somber"" is an understatement. To me, it sounds like a Middle-Eastern dirge. I don't know about her other music, but this particular CD is DARK!!! And, to my untrained ear, it sometimes sounds like she's yodeling out of key. My apologies to others that like the CD! :-(Why I bought this in the first place: My daughter loved Enya's ""May It Be"" song from LOTR - so I set about to find similar music in a genre that I am unfamiliar with. The Mirror Pool came up as ""similar"" to Enya music (which I am also unfamiliar with), and the price was right, so I ordered it.Obviously, there are people that love this - but I felt like I should post just in case there are others out there, like me, that are unfamiliar with this music."
5,peaceful and contemplative,lisa gerrard continues to be one of my favorite female voices and The Mirror Pool ranges from peaceful to comtemplative. its richness is layered and i highly recommend this album.
4,"""Look Inside"" is wrong!","I do love these First Discovery books with the clear overlay pages (and my 4 and 6 year-old sons do too). The ""Look Inside"" has the wrong ""Weather"" book though."
4,"Wilton 10-Inch Cake Circle, 12-Pack","What can you say about a circle of corrugated paper board. It very adequately serves as something to hold a cake that you are giving away, maybe; the cardboard plates may be more expensive than the garage sale cake plates that I have."
3,More field-noise recordings,"Rehberg & Bauer are responsible for the Mego label out of Austria. Each is also responsible for the projects General Magic and Pita (respectively). To anyone who has heard these projects or anything on Mego, it should come as no surprise that this is an incredibly odd and inaccessible album. It's full of weird digital frequencies and feedback, clipping and squirming all the while. It's not as rhythmic as General Magic or as relentlessly noisy as Pita but rather a happy medium of the two."
4,petite and pretty,"these earrings are very pretty. they are well made and sturdy. i bought them for my youngest stepdaughter and they were the perfect size. she's 9 but looks like she's 6 or 7. the only suggestion i would make is to go out and get some earwire backs (the little rubber bumpers that you put on earwires to keep them secure in your ear) as these have a tendancy to try to walk out of your ears. they are just too light weight to stay in properly. once you do that, they're perfect."
5,"Listen, learn, & enjoy","Sonny Stitt plays this 1956 studio session like a man on a mission. He has so much to say that it takes two horns (and a lot of fast-moving licks) to do it. In some cases, he switches between alto and tenor on the same tune. Overall, this album is a joyous outpouring of inspired playing by one of the most competent and confident saxophonists of his time, backed up by a solid three-man rhythm section.The 10 tracks, totaling 46 minutes, offer a nice selection of blues riffs and jazz standards, including ""Body and Soul,"" a requirement in every jazz saxophonist's repertoire. The fast-paced tunes are a great adrenalin rush, but there's also plenty of pent-up energy occasionally bursting to the surface in the slow tunes. This is a very satisfying listening experience for sax lovers, and a humbling one for sax players."
3,Lodge Fish Pan is bigger than standard oven,"At first I was thrilled with the pan.Looked nice and big. Big enough to poach a whole salmon, which is what I had in mind when I ordered it.Then, we tried to season the pan, as you must all cast iron cookware.The process calls for one hour in the oven aftere coating with oil.I was amazed to find the pan is too big to fit in the oven.So, I'll get creative and season it on the grill when the snow stops. But, I'll never enjoyh any roasts or oven baked fish or any other dishes in this pan which require the oven.If that's what you have in mind, better have a commercial sized oven."
3,Not enough of Kim,"She has a secondary role in this film, and yet she steals the show with her beauty and sexuality"
3,Late night Cinemax fare- sexy B movie,"A rookie Los Angeles police detective's (William Christopher) first case leads him into a world of sexy strippers, nightclubs, and sexual affairs when he is assigned to protect a dancer (J. Cynthia Brooks) from a murderer."
5,Best Tomb Raider Yet,"This round Lara is swept up in quite a few new adventures. There are more new moves, more complex puzzles not to mention more difficult enemys to destroy. The Croft Manor is a fun puzzle in itself as well. Over all a great addition to the Tomb Raider game list."
3,"Eau d'Orange, Florida's natural.","Very, very citrusy. This bears repeating. Cologne is subjective, so I won't judge for this quality, just be aware. If you like it, you will like it. If not, it may smell rather offensive to you. I had comments ranging from ""sweet and juicy"" smelling to ""alcoholic and strong"". I would advice checking this one out in a department store before purchasing."
1,Never will buy fragrance online,I had a tester of this fragrance and the product that was shipped to me smells nothing like it. Very disappointed.
3,Hard to Read,"I found this map difficult to read. It was useful in locating my hotel relative to the old city in a general way, but would not have been useful in figuring out how to drive to my hotel. If you can wait until you get to Jerusalem, get the free map from your hotel or visitor center or both. I was hoping for a more legible map of the old city and found the free maps to be much better than this one."
2,A pretty map that stays dry in the rain,"Ok, this is a product that I should have known better about ... because it is a simple map of Jerusalem that doesn't even compare to the city maps available in most hotel lobbies. The layout of the map is at first confusing as well but I did use it because it was raining.It is a well made product and the rain bounces off of it so unlike the hotel maps you can hold it in the rain or float with it in the Dead Sea.But, I would not spend my money for a map like this again ..."
5,Revised Streetwise Jerusalem Map,"I have been waiting for this updated version to come out for years. Now the Jerusalem Zoo, among other important sites, can be found with ease. These are the best travel maps I have ever used."
5,Tremendous film! Wonderful brass band music!,"I love British brass bands! If you like this kind of music, this is the film for you. The flugel horn solo was super. I could listen to the Flornetiner March 1,000 times!"
5,I love this movie,"I love this movie very much and I always will. I admit to watching it at least once a week, for the past few months...hopefully I will NOT be cured soon! There is something unique about this movie, and I've seen my share, believe me."
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD","I'm sure a lot of people will be a little bit upset with me for giving this movie such an average grade. My grade is for the DVD itself. As much as I like this movie(5 stars for the movie itself), the DVD is typical of so many discs rushed to market as the movie studios attempt to cash in on the new medium. Perhaps only a purist, or techno-weenie as I'm sure many would say, would notice, but the digital encoding of the picture was an inferior quickie that has resulted in ""jaggies"" visble in normal playback. Second, the extras. There are none. Despite the back of the box listing Dolby Surround, Theatrical Trailer, and Chapter Search as Special Features, these are all standard elements of any DVD. Give me a running commentary by Mark Herman, Ewan McGregor, Pete Postelwaite, and Tara Fitzgerald and I will change my rating to five stars."
5,"Charming, funny, moving, lovely little film","This is a delightful movie! Overshadowed by ""The Full Monty,"" which was released the same year, this one is actually more affecting in many ways. Pete Postlethwaite is a wonder, Tara Fitgerald is luminous, the remaining cast is unparalled, and the script is terrific. You can't go wrong with this movie."
5,Excellent New Solo Album,"I have had the opportunity to meet and hear him play on several different times. He is an amazing player as well as an great man. His solo album has several highlights for me. The first is the two Bozza pieces, Caprice and Lied. His interpretation really brings out the harmonies and the melodies. I especially liked the fanfare parts of the Caprice and the slow lyrical statement of the Lied. The Carnival of Venice and La Virgin del Macerana contain many kinds of musicals statements and amazing technical facility. This is great album and I would look at especially if you are a trumpet player who is playing these pieces, but also to people who like modern trumpet music."
3,"Not so bad - but not too good, either","By today's standards, as far as technical aspects and narrative pace are considered, Frozen Alive is quite mediocre and definitely very much a B movie. However, it has its merits, namely: the basic idea of the story - which I will not give up here - works pretty well. The main actors handle their roles OK. For anyone interested in spaghetti westerns it's nice to see Marianne Koch of The Fistful of Dollars fame in another movie made in the same year as Leone's groundbreaking first western film. Koch is quite good here, in a speaking role - with Leone's film she only had her good looks, as there were hardly any lines to speak for her as Marisol. Veteran actor Mark Stevens does his job very professionally, too. The story would have worked OK as a 30 or 45 minute episode in Alfred Hitchcock Presents TV series. For a feature film it's somewhat too long, even though one does see it through without getting bored."
1,"GREAT ALBUM, BUT YOU'RE BUYING THE WRONG VERSION!","The Japanese imports of the Doobie catalog are remastered.Warner Brothers here in the U.S. is still selling the old LP-EQ'd, terrible-sounding masters they released on CD in 1990.If you love these albums, get a set of the Japanese editions. They cost more, but they're worth it."
5,The transition album,"Tom Johnston was ill and had some drug issues and thus Michael McDonald took over as the ""leader"" of the Doobs in this 1976 jewel. The bulk of the group stayed the same except that Jeff Baxter bridged the guitar gap left by the departure of Johnston becoming a full timer. Patrick Simmons, Tiran Porter, John Hartman and Keith Knudsen made up the rest of the core. Backed by the Memphis Horns, Bobby La Kind (congas) and Maria Muldaur (cameo vocals in ""Rio""). This album blends rock, jazz, soul and pop to perfection. Highlights include ""Wheels of Fortune"" and ""It Keeps You Running"". Tom Johnston's ""Turn It Loose"" was the only song he sang in and wrote. A great '70s listen."
1,Dreadful sound,"This sacd sounds just dreadful. How can MOFI release such crap? I'm really angry that they boast about fantasic soung, etc, when the sound is just muddy, no high, no low end, no nothing.MOFI really has lost the plot. Nor just this release but all the latest releases. They most use the wrong equipment or something. The records they release sounds dull with no snap and no dynamics. I sugest that we as consumeres tell them and protest by sending them e mails telling them this."
2,Fine music seriously marred by poor sonics,"Michael McDonald and Patrick Simmons have outstanding vocal talents and gave us compositions that, even after 30 years, still sound fresh. But you won't get to that conclusion by listening to this CD. While the vocal efforts here are strong, the rythms driving, and the tunes catchy, this CD sounds as if a sonic veil has been thrown over the music. Think of what you hear when listening to a recording that is being played back on speakers in another room, or the sound you would hear using the tiny speakers on, say, a 13"" TV set, and you will get an idea of how badly this CD captures the band's perfomance. If you enjoy the Doobie Brothers, avoid this recording: it will only cause disappointment over a lost opportunity to appreciate some great tunes played by fine musicians."
1,One Song,How many bands over the years have started out with great material only to have another singer come on board and everything changes. Sometimes change is good but when it isnt needed it isnt welcomed. Journey had to get a new singer and in comes Steve Perry and the sappy ballads. The Tom Johnston era Doobie Brothers is a lot better on so many levels wether you agree or not. I dont really need to explain that do i everyone who reads this review has already heard The Doobie Brothers before and if you were blessed enough to have good taste in music having Michael Mcdonald take over the lead vocals wasnt gonna work. Now for me this is a rare case where my favorite song on the album was the big hit. It Keeps You Runnin (Great Hook) is the catchiest song on the album and the only song i like and never tire of. Here is an example of where the keyboard is the hook (im not sure what Michael used for a keyboard here). His vocals are fine on that song but like i said the catchy part is the keyboard.
1,Wrong Product,Ordering this item will not get you the SACD version of this excellent cd. I had the misfortune of having to return it. I received a refund without a hitch though.
1,Wrong subtitles,"Takin' It to the Streets [BOX SET] [SINGLE] [DUALDISC] [ENHANCED] [HYBRID SACD] [RINGLE] [SOUNDTRACK]. This CD contains nothing from the description above. It's a conventional, audio CD, with bad sound quality. I'm throaty dissatisfied. Don't buy this."
3,I like it,"I do like this CD, mainly because he has an amazing voice and the messages in the songs are right on point. The songs do sound very similar when you first listen to it - somewhat like the old R&B in the early 90's. I can tell it may take a little bit for me to LOVE the CD because the songs don't have the contemporary beats. But I can also tell that when I learn the songs, that I will play it over and over again :-)"
5,Great CD,"This is a great gospel CD!!! Many people have no Idea on what they are missing. I had been looking for him to come out with a CD since back in 2004, I am so glad I waited, because it was well worth it! I have just been buying the CD, just to give to people for a gift, because I refuse to loan mine out!! If you have a chance please get this CD, you will not regret it!!!"
4,Good book on order picking methods,"This book quickly covers the most common methods and equipment used to receive, move, store, pick, and ship materials within a warehouse environment. Much of the book focuses on the order-picking process, which makes it a good choice for fulfillment operations. Of particular interest is the detailed info on slotting as well as an objective discussion of the pros and cons of automation. The size of the book (only 233 pages) results in somewhat brief treatments of the various topics. On the plus side, this makes it a quick read for someone wanting to become familiar with warehouse operations, on the minus side you may find that you need to go to another resource to get more detailed info on a specific topic."
2,World-Class Warehousing and Material Handling,"Interesting overall view for beginners in warehousing. It has a superficial treatment on very critical issues such as receiving and putaway. Also it's so focused on order picking (the author's experience) that provides an unbalanced view of Distribution Centers. It doesn't address any type of raw material warehousing insights, it focused more on finished goods distribution centers. Limited applicability of the content."
4,Great overview of concepts,I found the book helpful in learning some basics of warehousing. I appreciated the overview of various types of equipment and racking. The book focuses more on distribution systems but I found many of the concepts can be applied to MRO warehousing(zoning and slotting in particular)with some tweaking.
1,"Not the product, but the dated product","First of all I want to say that my dog loves the Wellness treats and I think they are one of the best treats out there for your dogs health. However, I ordered this item in a three-pack in August, and they sent me items that expired in September. These are normally dated out a year or more since they are a jerky. Not cool."
5,Definately a lost gem.,Great purchase definitely worth the money right here. I don't have much to say except this is a classic hard hittin' lyrics and beats.RBX is dope!
1,Disappointed in quality,Don't get me wrong I am a huge Sinatra fan....but....the quality of the video and audio were poor at best for today's technology. I found the video equivalant to copying an old VCR tape to DVD and the Audio was simulated stereo. I also bought a second one and the quality is the same. I definately do not recommend this if you are looking for a concert experience.
4,"""Sinatra."" Nothing more to say.","While this isn't the best Sinatra concert around, it's still very, very good. Frnakie mostly croons his standard playlist, which is a good thing, but I also enjoyed his rendition of what he called the greatest love song ever written -- ""Something"". Also, his tribute to Dino Martin was sincere and a pretty darn good song. On top of that, he's introduced by Princess Grace, the classiest and loveiest woman in Hollywood history (you can't get a better intro than that.) All in all, this wasn't Sinatra at his peak, both in voice and appearance. But considering what he's singing and how he's singing, this is still an essential DVD for any Sinatra fan or fan of popular music."
4,Thoughtful Frank,"I really enjoyed this performance. It doesn't have a lot of pinache and energy, but it oozes warm sentimentality and a mellow mood. Frank appears to have had something or someone on his mind that night. You will sense that he is feeling low. The rendition of the Beatles' tune Something is simply beautiful."
4,The All Time True Singing Champion,"In my lifetime, no one, not one, could do all the things Frank Sinatra could. He was the ultimate craftsman. Ballad, swing, blues, big band up-tempo, look out, Frank would sew it together to anyone's satisfaction.This concert with intro by his friend Grace Kelly, shown in color and very good sound, illustrates exactly what this writer said in sentence one. What command! Great pizazz! He's locked in, his leader and the band too. What a collective effort. Know what? Nearly every available concert you see by Sinatra is one of a kind. No pop singer will ever approach his fastidious approach to delivering vocal and instrumental music. I am buying this and serveral more of his DVD's for Christmas. The present is a forever keeper."
2,The beginning of the decline,"Recorded in November, 1970, about a year after the self-titled SINATRA (1969), this was not an NBC special, but probably a BBC special.The decline in one year's time is apparent. Noticeable weakening of vocal powers, he looks lifeless, on the opener, ""You Make Me Feel So Young"", he swipes at the high note instead of holding.He pulls it off because of who he is, but make no mistake: the long nights, booze and smokes caught up for good at this point.Go back to the previous shows and it is painfully obvious."
5,Great quality deep fryer and its MADE IN USA,"This deep fryer kit is great for many reasons:Even heatingDurable cast iron (forever)Oil Tempature doesn't drop as you add food unlike other cheap deep fryersMADE IN USA!!!Unfortunately the basket and thermometer are made in chinaNice pre-seasoned finish, its nice not having to season cast ironIts a nice full kit in a boxFor those who complained about the size.. Thats why they are called product descriptions, it describes the dimensions and capacity of the deep fryer. Its perfect for everyone from the single person to the full size family! Drop in a small amount of finger food or fry all day long for a family."
2,My wife hates it when i cook with this thing...,"Always a greasy stove top mess to clean up after using this thing, even with a splatter screen... it's not really big enough to fry a big batch either... it comes with a nice thermometer but it's clip doesn't fit the edge of the pot.. it seems to fit best in the hole in the small open handle opposite the big handle.. I've got a ton of Lodge stuff and this is my least favorite piece."
4,Knew they would be good!,"I bought two to replace two 25 year-old square Cuisinart Prep Boards that finally bit the dust. The surface is not so brittle that it dulls knives. The surface is hard enough that you can cut chicken or meat, clean the boards and then cut fruit or veggies, cheese or bread without fear of cross-contamination. The all-around lip is terrific and keeps juices from running onto the counter-top. Carrot or beet stains are easily removed with bleach and water solution. As I mentioned in the opening statement my original purchases from a cookware shop lasted at least 25 years! Daily usage finally ground away at the surface of one and I accidentally melted the edge of the other by placing it too close to a gas burner. They are real work horses. I prefer the square shape but was willing to give the rounds a try. They slip and slide more, (hence the 4 stars), leaning against the back-splash of my counter-top where they are ever-at-the-ready to be used, next to the knife block."
2,Slippery board,"The bottoms of the board was not made from non slip material. As a result, the board slip around while cutting, which is not very safe to say the least."
4,JUST BOUGHT TWO MORE,"I originally bought these at a discount store and after many, many years of use, the surface is worn and discolored. I was excited to find them on Amazon and bought two of the rectangular boards. As has been said, the best feature is the raised edge; it doesn't interfere with cutting and chopping but it does prevent juices from meats or fruit from running off the sides.My only disappointment is that the surface is not impervious to knife marks. Minor detail as I wouldn't use them as serving platters anyway but they are invaluable for prep work."
4,"Very useful cutting board, prevents juice from spilling","We used this as a cutting and serving board for many years. I recently bought another, since it is so very useful for cutting juicy things and keeping the liquid from spilling, such as melon. It hold more liquid in than the wooden cutting boards with channels, which often overflow. It also serves as a tray for defrosting at room temperature, in the refrigerator, or the microwave. Note: It cannot be used for heating up things in the microwave, only for very low settings such as ""Defrost."""
4,Great Food Preparation Tool,"I wanted something durable that also had curved edges so when I cut food that has liquids (meats, tomatoes, etc) the liquid would not run off/over. This is a handy prep board and also fits in the cupboard on top of my dishes. I use it to thaw frozen foods too! The only drawback is it does slide on the counter a bit but its attributes outweigh that! Recommended!"
2,"Good idea, poor execution","I really like the raised edges of these boards when working with wet ingredients, like cutting tomatoes. However, the thin material of the boards warps/cups, making the board rock on its center on the counter. This combined with the slippery nature of the material itself makes for a very frustrating if not dangerous situation while chopping. The only solution I have found is to put a folded damp kitchen towel under the board to stabilize it. Frankly, that's more trouble than it's worth. For now, I am just using them for holding ingredients after I have prepped them on a better cutting board."
5,The Best,"After almost 20 years, I'm looking to replace mine. I''m so glad it's still available. I'll be ordering another one. The curved up edges all around are what makes the board unique and truly wonderful to use. Everything from diced onions to melon juice stays put during cutting/slicing. I love this board."
5,The best counter prep boards ever!,"I own several of these, which are perfect for every kitchen job needed. One is marked specifically for chicken, one for veggies, one for beef and so on. They wash well in the dishwasher and have had no issues whatsoever."
1,DIABOLICAL SLANDER,The thesis of this trash is absurd and a total lie of the worst criminal intent. The truth is that the author has no substance or capacity for real debate against Chomsky's legitimate work so he has to resort to insane and purile lies. The worst kind of conspiracy theory crap. Noam Chomsky is not perfect who is? But the accusation promoted here is easily erased by the thousands of statements and written words by Chomsky that totally contradict and disprove the author's mad invention.One can only wonder who is the true pay-master behind this poison?
3,"Cute, but...","I ordered these shoes in my normal size (8) and they are waaay too big. I'm sad because they are really cute and seem like they'd be really comfortable if they fit, and they don't have any smaller sizes in brown. :("
5,works great,works good and if you dont wanna buy garmin maps there are some you can buy from national geographic for less than the garmin pricesTOPO! National Geographic USGS Topographic Maps (California)theres one example
5,Charming Woody movie & Swedish BluRay plays fine,"As for the movie itself it's becoming one of my favorite Woody movies (which is saying something, I'm a huge fan). The cast is great, and the movie is charming, warm and has several laugh out loud moments. But it's hard to get in the US. We already own the DVD but wanted to upgrade to Blu-Ray, but it was not available in the US. So we took a chance with this Swedish release. The Blu-Ray quality was worth the upgrade. The picture is incredible and even though this is a light musical comedy it really does add to the viewing experience. One caveat: there's no way to set subtitle preference to OFF before the movie starts (the menu options are different Scandinavian subtitles) so it will begin with Swedish subtitles. However, once the movie starts you can pause it and a menu appears which does allow you to set the subtitles to off. It's a small inconvenience for this lovely Woody movie on Blu-Ray."
3,I love you Me neither,"Woody Allen strikes again with his kind of double-tongue-in-the-cheek humor. Love is nothing but a failing hunt away from the real object of that love. Man is not able to see his happiness in his own nest and tries to get it from the other side of the road where the grass is always greener. It is funny political satire at times, but it is light and musical and the depth of the story is hard to find on the Paris embankments that have been cleaned of their homeless and begging individuals for the occasion. Even Venice has clean water in its canals and no mud. So what will happen ? Nothing really except going back to the old stables and finding out that our stall is taken and that we cannot share it really with the new occupant. Some kind of light fable for some festive evening with the help of some friends and a bottle of champagne, if you can afford it, or them. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universites of Paris IX and II"
3,One for Woody Allen Fans Only!,"Sorry to act as the skeleton at the feast but why all the 5* reviews? This is clearly a film which shows that Mr. Allen is as fallible as any film director and just as capable of churning out substandard work?I have enjoyed his work over the past 25+ years - especially the recent ""Deconstructing Harry"" which was excellent. Clearly Mr. Allen is at his best when he's being funny - something he does so well. He also has proclivity for wanting to create films which are nostalgic and romantic. In my view he is not bad at this but he is not particularly good either.This film failed to draw me in and I have to admit that I was not sufficiently interested to watch it all the way through. On that basis I would hesitate to recommend it. I'd advise you to spend your money on the aforementioned ""Deconstructing Harry"" which is every bit as funny and mordant as his earlier films."
3,Who's the Crazy one?,Woody Allen plays an obsessed lover spying on Julia Roberts who is in therapy. I think Woody Allen's character is the one who really needs the therapy.
2,Musical - Silly & Very Predictable.,"Goldie Hawn, Alan Alda, Julia Roberts and the other cast members all did a great job acting, it's just that I wasn't expecting it to be a musical. Usually I don't mind them, but this movie grated on my nerve. I didn't even watch the movie all the way through, which is HIGHLY unlike me."
1,Woody in over his head,"Awkward mix of New York neuroticism and bad production numbers. Allen's propensity for making these characters such cardboard figures makes you wonder whether he truly LIKES the musical genre. Add to that the sheer chutzpah of teaming himself up romantically with Julia Roberts (AS IF!), and you've got one half-baked pastry. Skip it."
1,Everyone says find actors who can sing!,"As a film musical fan, nothing would be please me more than to bring this genre back. But when Broadway is jammed packed with killer singer dancers, why star people who can't sing or dance in a musical? This just puts more nails in the musical's coffin.This musical isn't charming, witty and represents Woody at his worst. Watch his brilliant Bullets Over Broadway instead."
4,"Light and airy fun, if not deep","A cute, inventive film with a couple of great musical numbers, and somefun characters (Tim Roth in particular is terrific), but lacking anysense of depth.For me, this doesn't hold up on repeated viewings nearly as well asmost Allen films. It feels more one joke on returning to it. Almostevery Allen film I've seen has only grown on me with time, withadditional layers and themes becoming evident. This was a rareexception.Still Allen's overall playful use of musical techniques makes thisworth at least one viewing. I'd still rather see a flawed work by amaster, than most of what's available."
4,No good deed goes unpunished,"This lovely-to-look-at and amazing-to-listen-to film was a major departure from the typical angsty Allen film....and because of that, it's unappreciated....Amazingly, it's unavailable on DVD...I hope that changes soon!"
3,Only for the dedicated.,"Woody Allen's foray into musical comedy with 'Everyone says I love you' is very hit and miss, with more miss than hit. The dedicated Allen fan will appreciate it as an example of his willingness to experiment with different styles. The less forgiving may see it as an indulgent mistake that seemed like a good idea at the time. Woody brings in lots of star recruits, as usual, including a small part for the nascent Star Wars star Natalie Portman. The highlight is Goldie Hawn who is by far the best singer a dancer of this ensemble. The lowlight is Julia Roberts singing - a BIG mistake."
1,I wanted to return this item.,"Due to my own error, thought I'd ordered a DVD but it turned out to be VHS! Would have liked to return it!"
4,"Wonderful, feel-good production",Hats off to Woody Allen for making a musical film. Wonderful feel-good production will leave you all smiles! Beautifully photographed. Makes you want to get on the next flight to Venice and Paris! Brilliantly cast. Excellent acting all around. Highly recommended.
3,This is a decent movie,"This movie is not great at all but it is often entertaining. It is very strange, silly, and corny at times though. Natalie Potman's performance is totally overrated. She barely does anything and she is somewhat annoying. It is nice to see some new faces in this film such as Natashia Leon. She is very delightful as the young socialite daughter. If you are a Woody Allen fan and or you like musicals than I suggest this."
3,Living in the midrange,"This film has only one really funny scene in it. The ""everyone sings"" gag just doesn't work. Lucky for Allen he can keep doing a movie a year and lose money 80 per cent of the time. This one has an army of ""names"" in the cast, which is a growing trend in Woody's films. This one is a rental at best I think, particularly since it's $9 more than ""Manhattan""."
4,HIGHLY ENTERTAINING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just a great blend of characters singing various musical numbers . The movie contains very funny parts , and though the plot is not something out of this world , the movie is highly entertainging. ""Everyone says I love you"" was truly a pleasant experience."
3,MUSICAL. 14th dec 2004.,"If your into the musical type of film, you will love this. I found it watchable and quite a good film but i wouldn't say this is more than 3 out of 5.Some of the actors werebrilliant, and the film is worth buying because most of the film was quite good."
4,"Intradition of Allen films, He takes the lead, and the fall","Woody Allen's films start to all blend together. Woody stars, he falls in love with a beautiful woman, and heartbreak, with some whinning in between. But in ""Everyone says I love you"" it is actually humorous. Featuring stars such as Drew Barrymore, Goldie Hawn, Gabby Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Alan Alda, Edward norton and Julia Roberts, Woody is surrounded by talent as they take off in thie spoof of musical comedy."
2,"I Love DJ Spooky, But...................","This is garbage, abstract to the point of annoyance, get Necropolis instead. At least on Necropolis the meaningless noise is occasionally interupted by some massive beats. Odd for odd's sake."
4,Perfect fit!,"I don't understand how the cover is not sold with the pot. I bought the pot separately and bought the cover here. It fit perfectly, but it cost more than the pot! I bought the pot in Walmart for $19.99 and the cover here was $25.00."
2,dosn't fit very well,"Thought I did buy it for an 100 year old no-name cauldron, it is 1/8th of an inch too big"
2,Does not fit the SK12 skillet,"I was shipped the lid, but it arrived after several days and is the wrong size. It plainly says 10 on the lid, even though the lid measures almost 12""."
5,LIDLESS SKILLET IS POINTLESS,"We purchased a vegetarian cookbook a while ago and there is a bit of a rant about non stick cookware in there and how you can't really bake in the oven with it etc etc. I have long wanted to be able to take a skillet (a big one of course), brown a something in it and then pop it straight into the oven to finish it off but have not been able to do so with any of our other cookware because all of it is non stick. SO, I bought a 12"" cast iron skillet and just had to have this lid to go with it in case I wanted to do casseroles in it as well. The lid has expanded an already large repetoire of cooking options for my beloved skillet and I accordingly recommend it to anyone who has a 12"" cast iron skillet and who wants to do more than just fry and open bake with that."
4,Ultra heavy-duty lid; spikes help for cooking but are a pain to clean,"This is a tank of a lid cover. Thick, solid, and the self-basting spikes keep condensing liquids from pouring all over your stovetop -- but they also make it a pain to clean. I think that they could have done a better job of creating spikes while not making them too difficult to clean (e.g., less spikes; have the spikes gradually stick out so you can run your scrub over it vs riddling the lid with spikes)."
4,The Perfect Companion,"For those who own the Lodge 12"" skillet. Patterned inside makes food cook better - but makes it harder to clean"
5,Lodge Never Lets Me Down,This is just another great cast-iron cooking product from Lodge. I use this lid with my Lodge 12 inch frying pan. I even take it when I go camping because there's nothing like bacon and eggs cooked in a cast-iron pan.
4,For the 'logic' skillet only!,"Be sure you have the 12-inch Lodge Logic skillet, and not the 12-inch Lodge PRO Logic skillet! This lid might fit the former, but it sure doesn't fit the 12-inch Pro Logic. The lid for that one is, as I write this (7/1/2010), not available from Amazon.It is a nice lid, though. I like the little spikes that wick moisture back into the food."
5,Perfect,The top to the lodge pan is an excellent piece. It is excellent quality and worth buying. I do wonder however if the price is a tad bit over priced.
5,perfect fit! great quality!,"This item was a perfect fit for our 12"" frying pan. Quality was better than expected. Price...the best on the market!"
3,Mr. Bruce Kollmann,"It is a fun machine, and more of my grandchildren will enjoy it in the future as they get old enough.Bruce Kollmann"
4,A good glimpse of Chilean politics,"Unlike in his novels, García Márquez uses a straight-forward journalistic tone to tell the story of Miguel Littin, exiled from his native Chile and brave enough to infiltrate his country in the mid 80's to film the consequences of the Pinochet dictatorship. The story has its tense moments and I recommend it for those interested in military dictatorships in Latin American. Of course, you should see Littin's film, too!"
5,Classic and wonderful entry to social psychology,I read this book for the first time in 1987. The years have passed but still Roger Brown's observations and description provides a brilliant and wonderful reading for both academics and the lay reader. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learining about social psychology.
5,The Best,"I've read the autobiography numerous times. I love it almost as much as I love the man who wrote it, my grandpa! Its just as good as listening to the wonderful stories from his own mouth!"
2,"Good exposure to pieces, poor performer","These are all great pieces that are not heard enough. I was quite dissapointed, however with the playing of the soloist in the Piston. There are several missed runs, sloppy passages, and certain parts of the cadenza are excluded. This recording is good for exposure to the pieces, but I wouldn't exactly say that it is inspiring."
3,ok,"Very interesting subject matter. The actual movie ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" is better. A must-see for anyone in the health care field as it shows the thoughts of a patient who cannot communicate in the normal way."
5,Powerful,"What can I say?A video of a tragedy? Or a video of a work of love?I read and saw ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"", and a friend made me aware of this video. It was interesting and moving. A rare glimpse into another world."
5,IMHO this is the best mid-priced filler paper,"IMHO this is the best mid-priced filler paper - 20, not 15/16 lbs, very strong mylar-reinforced edge and does not tear as easy as 15/16 regular paper :) from being turned back and forth. Schoolwork looks much neater than when done on a regular stock."
5,"I have it on VHS, and I can't believe it's not on DVD","I loved ""The Snapper"" and ""The Commitments,"" and for the life of me, I don't understand why this has not been released on DVD here in the US. For my money, it's the best of the Barrytown Trilogy films.If you can download and watch this film, by all means, do so! The dialog alone between the characters as they watch Team Ireland play in a World Cup match is by itself worth the price of admission.Colm Meany rules, wha?"
1,No pictures,"Why anyone would buy a book pertaining to photographs that contains NO photographs is beyond me. I feel that Amazon sold me this item under false pretensis. It seems that anything that is supposed to have pictures, and is on Kindle, has somehow lost the pictures in the process of digitizing it. Shame on Amazon."
3,Fascinating!,"The whole idea of the existence of such creatures blows one's mind. Yet, the reports of the Cottingley sightings, together with the photographs, seem to be authentic. I have to reserve judgement, but it is extremely interesting to entertain the thought of this being possible."
