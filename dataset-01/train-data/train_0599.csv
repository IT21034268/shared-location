1,Grew mold on the bottom,Worked great but too hard to clean and discovered it was growing mold on the bottom. Ended up getting the Aroma kettle to replace it and could not be more pleased. Much easier to clean.
4,Tiny cord,"Bought this for the office, and have to keep it basically on the floor for the cord to reach a plug - it is less than 2' long. Other than that it works fine."
4,"No frills, but does the job","This kettle has performed as advertised. We use it daily. Other reviews talk of a strong plastic smell or taste, but we have not noticed this in any way after following the initial instructions. The water boils very quickly, and since I like my tea hot but not scalding, I usually shut it off after just a few seconds. The cord is not very long, and cordless would be nice, but for this price, I am well-pleased with the purchase."
1,Worked fine for 6mos then died,"I was using this kettle to heat water for tea every day. I always made sure it was filled above the 'min' line and had no problems with it. After 6mos, it simply stopped working. There's not much one can do to 'fix it', there were no problems with the coils or cord that I could see, so in the trash it went. We have used theAroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettleat work for years, so I bought one of those at home and am much happier with it."
4,Good product at Good Price,"I have been using this electric kettle for over 2 mos and have had no problems with it. It does a very good job of heating the water fast. Some have complained of the noise. It is a little loud but so are many coffee makers. The automatic shut off is a plus feature for me. I did not have the problem of a bad ""plastic smell"". I followed the directions and heated three pots up before using it the first time. There was a slight plastic smell at the very first but that went away quickly and I never encountered a plastic taste to my coffee. I use it every morning for coffee and/or tea. The only thing I did not like was the location of the on/off switch which is located at the top just in back of the spout cover. It is easy to use and I would recommend it."
2,You get what you pay for.,I bought this for my workplace as I enjoy drinking tea more then coffee. I used it twice and the heating element broke broke.
4,"A few small issues, but overall durable and reliable","I purchased this about two and half years ago to use in my dorm. It boils water quickly and I like the auto shut-off feature. Overall I have very few complaints about this product--it does what I need it to do and has held up nicely over the years. I've never had a problem with it not working.As others have mentioned, the lid is not perfectly tight around the spout and water/steam sometimes sloshes out over the sides while you're pouring. I haven't really found this particularly inconvenient or dangerous, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless. I suppose the lid is really the only ""iffy"" part of this product. It must ""click"" and be closed securely in order for the auto shut-off to work, so usually I just give the lid a firm smack to close it all the way.As far as I'm concerned, for $15 I got my money's worth, especially considering how well this product has held up. I'll probably have it for a few more years to come."
2,The Plastic Smell Wouldn't Dissipate,"I bought this kettle over 2 months ago, for its compact size, to sit on my desk at work. But, after over a dozen washing - at first with dish soap and even tried soaking in vinegar once - plus dozens of pot of boiled water, it still makes the water smell like plastic. The smell continues to overwhelm the tea I try to make. I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash today."
1,I got a lemon,"The cord is way too small; it is almost strange. It makes it harder to let the water out. The only other thing, and this is a big one for me, is that the auto shut-off doesn't work. I combed the manual to see if I missed something and found in a place you wouldn't normally look that one should unplug and plug the item before each use.(who need that)?So I tried that realizing I could live with it.And, nope, it didn't work.I immediately emailed the seller about this and haven't heard back yet; I think it takes a few days.****IF YOU BUY THIS UNIT, BUY FROM AMAZON; THEY IMMEDIATELY SEND YOU A LABEL COVERING SHIPPING CHARGES***I have since boughr a cordless electric kettle for 3 extra bucks. I am sorry I didn't think to do this in the first place."
1,ICK! Don't buy this Piece of Junk!,"It works fine, but I have boiled water over and over and over and over.... the water tastes like toxic plastic. Spend more money and get something made with something other than the cheapest plastic that leaches into your drink. ICK."
4,great tea kettle for the road,"I purchased this electric kettle through Amazon for my wife. She likes to have a hot cup of tea in the morning and late at night.I thought this kettle would be good for heating water when we're in a hotel room.(sometimes they do not supply anything to heat water for tea or coffee).It turned out to be great for what we intended it for. The only thing I would recomend,is to boil water mixed with a little white vinegar in it about 2 or 3 times and then plain water,before using it.This process gets rid of a plastic taste that you will have if this is not done.THIS KETTLE HEATS WATER FAST AND SHUTS OFF AUTOMATICALLY WHEN WATER IS BOILED."
5,I love it!,My husband and I were in the process of remodeling our kitchen when I bought this. Without a stove to boil water for tea and coffee we were microwaving our water (so gross) but this kettle works fast and it keeps the water hot for a long time. After our remodel I took it to work where I can use for tea.
5,safe,"I am very forgetful. I am always in a rush to leave the door in the morning, but I have to have my morning beverage. With this kettle I will not be scared that I forget to turn off the stove and have hot water in the morning. Very happy with this Kettle especially for a person like me that is so forgetful."
5,Quick and easy.,"I love this kettle. It boils water much quicker than a pan on the stove. I'd say it takes about 1 1/2 minutes to boil cold water from my refrigerator. It holds the perfect amount of water for a few cups of tea. I also use it for my coffee press. It's also great when cooking, if you're needing hot water quickly. It has an auto shut-off once it reaches boiling, so all your water does not begin evaporating. The only thing that could make it any better, is if the power plug was magnetic for quick detachment. However, the plug included is not too hard to take off. Overall it is a fantastic product for the price."
2,Okay but bad design,Not really a great design the switch on top very pron to catch on things and feels like it will break.
3,so-so,"I bought this product because I tend to forget that I am boiling water and I usually remember when the pot is dry-dry. I knew that one day I would set my house on fire. LOL! This product is great on boiling water in a few minute. However, I do not like the fact that it doesn't retain the water at a certain temperature that is drink-able. There's only hot-hot or cold-cold. To get the middle, you'll have to wait a few hours...which is bad because I already don't have good memories. I guess that's not it's fault because for this price, it served its expected functions."
2,you get what you paid for,"I put it in my office and I don't use it much because I have to unplug it, plug it every time I want to use it to go to the kitchen and fill it up. Otherwise works well."
3,Does its does but with limitations,"I bought this product because of the high reviews. This product seems to work fine and boils fast. However, it gets annoying having to remove the cord every time you want to move the kettle around and 1-quart is only good for a couple cups."
5,HOT Water,"This is great for quick hot water needs - tea, cup of soup, hot cocoa, etc. It's also a waste of water to run the sink until the water gets hot for washing counters or wetting washrags to wash up the kids' faces and things. I heat a few cups of water in a flash and get the job done without having to waste 3 minutes and 3 gallons of water!!"
3,"Ok, not great",This kettle is ok. During the first week we had a piece of plastic inside break off. Heats water very quickly.
5,This thing is great,This is one of my favorite gadgets (I'm a gadget freak) I keep it at work because I drink a lot of tea. It heats up really fast and it shuts off automatically so I won't forget and burn the place down.
5,Boils like a beast!,"This electric kettle was great for the price. I am very pleased with it. It does exactly what it is stated to do...boils water quickly. Immersion water heaters are great since they can boil water quickly. Works for any of your boiled water needs. I know there are ones that are much more expensive, but this product fulfills all my hot water needs."
5,Love this product!,"I used an electric kettle in the UK this summer; it was a staple in all hotel rooms. I loved the quick and efficient way to prepare water for tea, and was pleased to find that I could purchase a US model from Amazon.com. I have used it everyday since I received it. Much better than microwaving a cup at a time, or using the tea kettle on top of the burner. It shuts off automatically when it reaches full temp, and keeps the water hot for quite some time. Energy effiicient, safe, and convenient."
3,nice little kettle but poor on/off switch,"It is a nice little kettle for hot water, easy and quickI didn't find the plastic taste other review point out, but the on/off switch made me madIt has kind of special angles, I have to try several times to turn it on..."
1,poor quality and plastic smell,"I purchased this product a little over a month ago and it's already stopped operating correctly. It will heat for a few seconds, then shut off. It continues this cycle until I just give up and turn it off. The other thing I noticed right away was the plastic smell of the heated water. This did lessen over the month, but was still there. Not a product I'd buy again.My previous electric kettle was Ovente stainless/cordless which I accidentally broke. It will be a strong contender when I purchase a new one."
1,Broken after 2 days!,"I was very optimistic about this tea kettle and loved it out of the box, but it no longer works after only 2 days of use! I'm hoping it was a fluke and am requesting an exchange."
4,Works like I need it.,This electric kettel works just the way I need it but it is loud. I mean it might just be mine but it is extremely loud. And functional wise i dont like the power latch as it is very easy to turn off by accident.
5,does exactly what it's supposed to,It boils quickly and does exactly what its supposed to- i wish it was a little bigger and the cord a little longer (my old kettle was 1.5L and had a base you put the kettle on) otherwise it's perfect. I don't have problems with plasticky aftertaste ever the first few times I've used it. I've used it about 20 times by now.
4,Great value!,"I was looking for the cheapiest way to replace my first electric kettle. This product, priced the best through Amazon, fit the bill. It boils the water and then shuts itself off after letting the water boil for a minute or so. The one thing I do not like about it is that it doesn't whistle when the water is ready. If you're in another room you might not hear the click that shuts the kettle off so the water doesn't keep boiling. It has a short cord, but the cord unplugs easily from the kettle for carrying aroung and easy pouring. Does the job I expected, what else can I say."
2,Stopped working after a few months,"I purchased this unit from amazon and it worked great for several months and then it died. It no longer turns on. Needless to say its out of y warranty and outside my 30 day return policy with amazon. I'm now looking for a new, better built unit in the hopes that it will last longer than one season."
3,Good product with some minor flaws.,"I purchased the Proctor Silex K2070 electric kettle for work so I can boil water for my french press. The kettle is reasonably fast at boiling water and the auto-shutoff feature is a nice touch. I have a an issue with the lid ""sealing"" (there isn't a rubber gasket to insure a water tight seal), and as a result I have seen water exit from the sides of the spout and soak my counter-top. I also would like a longer power cord."
5,"works great, cheap and effective","i have two of those. one for about 4 years now - used daily, still works like new, never had a problem with it (unless you count a few times where i was getting frustrated why its taking so long only to realize that i hadnt turned it on :P), and a second one for a few months. it does what it is supposed to do and it is very inexpensive at that! the only think i could wish for is a slightly longer cord, the one it comes with is abt 2ft."
4,Good cost effectiveness !!,The kettle is really good for the price.is does not take long until the water boils and i takes till 1 liter.The only thing with bothers me a bit is that you always have to unplug the wire and that the kettle itself gets really hot.
2,worked well until it broke,ours lasted 4 months under normal use. worked fine until one day the light stopped working and it wouldn't heat for longer than a minute at a time. will see if we have any success returning it.
4,submerged heating coil means FAST boiling,"This electric kettle boils water really quickly because the heating element is a submerged coil, not just a plate on the bottom.The kettle automatically turns off when the water boils. It doesn't make a sound though to let you know when this has happened - only a slight clicking noise as the on-off switch physically flicks to off - so if you want boiling water, it's best not to walk away. Just watch it until it boils. Luckily it only takes a minute or two since the kettle is so fast.It's only intended for boiling *water* - no making soup or tea in this kettle, because of the heating coil."
5,so far so great,"This has been great! It's the perfect size, easy to store. I keep in a drawer at work and take it out to make tea because it's freezing in there. Love it. Leaves no bad taste and comes with a filter on the nozzle. I've had it for 6 months now and it's been great!"
1,Cord issue,Plugged it in to do some pre-boil to get rid of the plastic smell (I expected a couple of boils would get rid of the smell). I plugged it in again for the second boil and could not get the switch to go on. Manipulated the cord and the switch finally came on but moving the pot caused the switch to go off again. I am 250 pounds and I have the strenth to push a cord on but it did not make a difference. I have to gently massage the connection to get it to work. Returning! Ordering a Hamilton Beach Ensemble Cord Free Pouring Kettle instead. Twice the price but a 5 star review. Glad I order from Amazon.
2,Electric kettle,I do not like the large exposed coil. More don'ts than do's. The Rival electric kettle heats faster and there is no exposed coil. It is very nice looking but that's about it.
1,She's a splasher....,Great idea...but the execution was completely off. The spout was not the best...it actually spilled on me and burned me a couple of times. I would not recommend this unless you want to be scalded by your tea kettle.
4,looks good,I received it for a few weeks. But I didnt use it yet.It looks good as I wish. And I like it.Hope it works well as it looks.
4,"""Manual"" Electric Kettle with 7 Mins. or 4 Mins for Full Boil, 1 Liter","This is a very basic, economy electric kettle with an on/off button you turn on then manually turn off when you water is boiling or hot enough.I say it is manual because slightly more expensive models automatically turn off when water reaches boiling temperature. This one does not. But it does have a safety feature that turns it off when all all the water has boiled off to prevent over-heating, etc.To boil 1 liter of water to full boil (gushing with bubbles), it takes:About 7-7.5 Minutes for COLD Tap WaterAbout 4-4.5 Minutes for HOT Tap WaterOf course if you want your water hot but not necessarily boiling, it will take less time.Overall, well worth it considering the price, a very good economical model with great value"
1,You get what you pay for!,I purchased this item to make it easier from my granddaughter and I to have a quick cup of our favorite tea or a nice quick hot chocolate. We used it once and then it wouldn't work again. What a waste of time!
4,Good overall,This is a pretty good electric kettle for the price. It is on a smaller size which is perfect for when you need to make a cup of tea or to boil an egg.There is only one thing I don't care for in this kettle design; it has a thick and heavy duty electric cord that is attached to the kettle itself instead of having a 'base' so this cord tags along every time you pick the kettle up.
1,Broke in 7 month,"It worked only 7 months. Yes, it is cheap but I would expect it works at least 1 year.Also it has plastic taste in boiled water for a month when it was new."
2,Work Great for 8 Months,This product work great for 8 months it heated water fast. Then 8 months later it just stopped.
3,In Hot Water,"Delivery was very fast. The electric kettle doesn't seem as fast at boiling as the ones I used during a recent trip in the UK, but it is faster than the microwave or stove-top kettle when I want more than 1 cup of boiling water!"
5,Works like a Charm,"For the price, this little kettle can't be beat. Great for those of us who like pressed coffee but are too impatient to boil water."
5,Great Electric Kettle !,"This Electric Kettle is quite simple without any frills. It boils water quickly , the water level is easy to see and has the auto-shut off feature."
3,It works but oh my it's slow,"This little kettle does it's job. It get's the water nice and hot but it takes forever to do it, I've owned a couple of these and would recommend upgrading from this model to something with a base. That being said it does work."
1,This kettle is NOT auto shut off,I had put the kettle with about 1 liter of water to boil and then had a domestic emergency. The kettle did not shut off automatically and is thus now useless because the heating element burned. And I have had it only a few months.Buyer beware.
5,water heater,"I like this kettle. We went through a lot of tea kettles looking for one that worked for us and this was it. It's plastic so you don't worry about it's durability, it shuts off, it won't heat if there's not enough water...it's just a good electric kettle. I keep mine by the bed and fix me a cup of instant coffee (sometimes Int'l coffees)in the morning w/o getting out of bed. Yum."
3,Ideal,"Works great for boiling water for Tea. Like many others said earlier, the lid does not open and shut smoothly. I had to boil and discard the water a few times before I started using the kettle as it has quite a strong smell of plastic initially. I like the detachable cord feature and the compact design of the kettle."
4,"Very good product, excelent price","For the price, it does not get much better than this electric kettle. It is a nice size, not too large or small. The automatic shut-off is very nice. Over-all a competent, well-priced machine.Initially the product does have a fairly strong plastic smell, but it wears off after using it a few times."
5,Great!,"I ordered this kettle to use at work for tea and such. I love it. My coworkers ask to borrow it all of the time. It takes a little while to heat up, but when it does, it is HOT! By the way, don't stick your hand in the kettle until you have poured the water out or else you'll get a shock. I don't know why one would do this, but trust me!"
5,Very good little water kettle,"This little kettle does a great job, and it definitely deserves 5 stars because it's a terrific value for the price. The only problem is, it takes a bit until it boils the water if the kettle is full. Other than that, it's really cute, compact, and it does a great job. It's a great deal."
4,"Fast, easy, just right","I've been using this for a year it works very well. For a cup two of water, it is very fast. It is quite reasonable with more water. The automatic shut-off is great, too, but the light is too dim. I just listen to the click it makes when shutting off, but that may not be loud enough for you. I use it at my desk at work, so I always hear it. The detachable cord is the same as computer power cables, which is great if you ever lose or misplace it, or want a longer one."
4,"cute, wee, annoying kettle","tiny! but great for a single household. It heats up fast and is the quietest kettle I've ever used. After it turns off, the heated water stays warm for a LONG time, too. The cord is removable so you can unplug it from the base of the unit, which makes it easier to fill up at the faucet. The only annoying thing is plugging the cord back into the base... it slips out every time and you must jam the bugger in there out of sheer frustration for a connection to take. You can place the kettle on your table to top up your mug without having to return to the kitchen or have a dangling cord hanging off the back. It also doubles as a weapon: if an intruder should burst into your conservatory while you're studying and drinking coffee, you could DASH hot water in his/her face. lovely."
2,Ok - You get what you pay for,"I paid $10 for this item and that is what it is worth. The cord is too short, if you attempt to pour too fast, boiling water spills out of the top and scalds your hand. It is cheaply made and sometimes it does not shut off at all (supposed to shut off automatically when water boils). Top cover is cheap plastic and hard to open..know it will break within a year. Product was scratched and somewhat dirty (black stains and marks on exterior) and appeared reconditioned...but for $10.00, I'll use it til it breaks. Would not recommend or purchase again."
3,Pit Marks,"It heats the water quickly, but it got pit marks, almost like the beginning of rust, on the heating element. That surprised me for a electric kettle!"
5,Peace in the Office,"Just what the doctor ordered for our tea drinkers at the office. Simple to use, compact, effective and one less problem to solve."
2,Supposed to be 1 qt,The electric kettle does make hot water fast but it is supposed to be 1 quart. It's not. The volume is 1 liter.
1,"Do Not Buy - Defective Product, Terrible Vendor","DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM THIS VENDOR (Polsteins Home&Beyond). Although my order arrived promptly, the kettle does not work. When I got in touch with Customer Service to discuss replacement/refund, they told me to contact the manufacturer. I recommend selecting a different kettle that is not supplied by this vendor."
4,Produce Works as Described,"This model is not the cordless model, where the pot can be lifted from the heater-base. It is so economical that it wasn't worth sending it back for the other. It works as others have described and is a good value for the money, especially if part of an order eligible for free shipping. I would prefer a glass model, but these are not available at an economical price. I wish my old metal pot hadn't failed, because I preferred it to the plastic."
2,mediocre,This is a flimsy 4 cup kettle; internal coil is exposed and cord remains attached. I believe it is a fair deal only if one pays $5 or less for it.
2,Cleaning Issues,"I had to get a new electric water boiler after just a few days with this one, though it was my own choosing. It seemed to boil fine and all, but its crazy difficult to clean properly. The heating system is made of heating coils at the bottom of the container and you're pretty screwed if tea dregs accidentally get stuck down there or if someone uses it to boil something other than water, like milk, that will get insanely stuck to it! I saw screws on the back of the container and maybe if I had had those tiny screwdrivers and like five hours of time I could have figured out a way to get the coil out to clean them, I'm not sure. It didn't seem worth it. it's best in general to just spring for a slightly more expensive one- you pay for what you get!"
1,Don't,"The ""auto-off"" feature didn't work on ours. That would be reason enough to return it, but the other reason is that this simply isn't large enough - filled to capacity, it's still not enough for a bowl of oatmeal and even half a pot of tea. You get what you pay for . . ."
1,plastic taste,I bought this to make tea at work. It heats water quickly and turns off when the water boils. This is a nice safety feature if you don't babysit the tea kettle-but you will have to babysit this kettle if you don't want the kettle to flavor your water with plastic.Another bummer about this product is the ear on the plastic screen that strains the water when poured broke on first use. Now my kettle splashes water if I try to pour too quickly.This tea Kettle might get donated to the work lunch room. My next tea kettle will be metal with a detachable base rather than detachable cord. YGWYPF.
4,Proctor Silex Electric Kettle,"At first I thought this kettle would take up less space on the counter top than the low round ones. It did. However, I always unplugged my other kettles. I know it is a safety feature to automaticlly turn itself off, but when I plug it in I forget to turn it on in case it goes off automatically. I come back to cold water. Also, it is not quite ergonomically well designed. If I pour too fast, hot water comes out of the lid instead of the spout. I am also a little concerned about the ""exposed"" electrical element inside the water container. It works okay, but I miss my old kettle."
3,"Heats quickly, but the heating coil is exposed","This product has worked very well for me so far. It heats water quickly, but the heating element is exposed to the water in the reservoir. You can only use water (rather than other liquids, for example) in the kettle because of this. It would have been nice to know prior to purchasing."
4,Great purchase!,"I am a college student and was looking for something cheap to use to make things like tea and hot chocolate for the cool weather or for when I am sick.This item looked to be the perfect size and was an amazing price and I am on a tight budget.Despite some bad reviews, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. I did not experience any strange taste or problems. This coming from someone who is just getting out on there own and is usually bound to mess something up. Set up was so simple and its quick whenever I need to use it.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the cord is quite short, and plugs are limited in a cramped dorm.Other than that I am extremely happy to have this product!!! It's been working well for over a month now."
3,it's okay,This kettle it good for the price but I have trouble with scaling on the heating element. I use filtered water and the heating element on the bottom keeps getting a calcuim type build up that gets in the water and makes it un-drinkable. I know that this is still caused by the water I am using but would be avoided by using an electric kettle with a separate heating element and pot.
2,i guess you get what you pay for,I ordered this for my mom because she needed something to heat up water quick. It has been maybe a little over a month and the darn thing already broke! My mom says the red light does not light up when plugged in anymore. I only paid 9.99 for this - I don't think anyone should pay any more. I wonder what the warranty is.
4,Love it !!,"When my husband first bought this kettle I was a little sceptical on how well it would work and whether I'd like better than my old stove top kettle. First day I got this electric kettle I did a little experiment to see which was better or at least faster, the stove-top kettle or the electric kettle. Turns out the the electric kettle won hands down. Water was hot and ready in 2 minutes, just absolutely amazing. While the stove-top kettle took at least 5 minutes to heat up the water. I love it, Love it!The only down side, I wish there were some sort of indicator that announced that the water had finished boiling. Most of the time I am too busy catering to our two year old, that I don't notice that the kettle has turned off."
3,Good for travel,"I purchased the K2070 to take with me on extended business trips. The kettle is a decent size for travel, and I had trouble finding anything else smaller, tough the shape is a bit awkward for my suitcase. So far, it has been fast and dependable.The kettle definitely had a strong plastic odor on its first use. The directions recommended boiling and discarding the first few fills of water, and I found I needed at least 10 before the odor went away. When I use it now, the water tastes and smells completely clean. The cord is very short, which I'm sure is for safety reasons, but it was not long enough to reach a floor level outlet from a table or desk."
4,Good Buy!,I was concerned about this purchase because of the other reviews about the plastic taste. This is a smaller version of a pot I already have. I purchased this for work and the size super cute. It boils quickly and rapidly for such a small form factor.
4,Great little kettle,"Pros:-Quick to heat water-Visible water level-Doesn't require much counter space-Holds over a quart/liter of water-Automatically shuts off when water is hot-InexpensiveCons/Improvements--An audible signal (not just the sound of the switch clicking off) when water is hot would be useful-A function to keep water hot might also be valuable to someOthers have commented that the auto shut-off isn't ""permanent"". On my model, the on/off switch literally clicks off when the water is boiling and the kettle doesn't restart until I turn (lift) the switch on again.Very useful for heating water for tea or other beverages."
4,Great bang for your buck,"Good product. Boils quiet and quick. My only complaint is that if you boil the max amount of water and the lid isn't entirely shut, water tends to roll over the top and onto the table. It took about a week and a half of using it 1+ times per day to get rid of the plastic taste, but that was expected from reading other reviews."
4,"Solid, Diminutive Kettle.","This is going to be as short and sweet as a review for a kettle should be. It works. Doesn't hold a great volume. The cord attaches in the back of the kettle, just below the handle, and must be removed or otherwise dealt with when filling and pouring. This is contrary to my other, larger, kettle by Toastmaster (purchased at Target for $20). Though from the looks, both kettle would seem to be born from the same factory in Thailand, China, or whatever country or origin. I actually thought they were the same design, the Toastmaster has a base that plugs in, so you just lift the kettle off and fill/pour-- very nice.Regardless, it is as described, cheap and heats. Smaller size, so if that's what your looking for, this might be your cup of tea, for your cup of tea."
5,great for a hot cuppa...,"I actually discovered the electric kettle during a trip to Australia this summer. My new daughter-in-law had one and I used it every morning for tea and/ or coffee (Australian stores seem to stock more instant than brewing coffees). I fell in love with her kettle and was determined to buy one when I got home. I bought the sunbeam hotshot for my office and purchased this kettle for an English friend who makes tea by the cup in the microwave. The kettle heated up the water in about the same amount of time it took to heat one cup in the microwave, but we had enough for two cups or more."
4,Does what I want it to do,"I've had this kettle for about a month now, and I use it fairly often. Like other reviewers mentioned, the water has a plastic taste to it at first. However, boiling water with a few squirts of lemon juice seemed to clear that up pretty quickly. Also, it gets a little bit noisy as the water heats up. On the bright side, it gives you hot water quickly, which is all I wanted it to do. Another potential perk is that there is a removable screen at the spout; if, for some reason, you chose to boil water in this kettle and then put loose leaf tea into it to brew, then this screen would prevent any of the tea leaves from getting into your cup when you poured. I wouldn't mind if the cord were a little longer, but that's pretty minor. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive plastic kettle."
5,Works well and no problem whatsoever,"I have purchased this item for over a month and have been using it very frequently. I did not have the experience of the very plastic smell or taste, so I cannot speak for that. However for the price I paid for I am extremely happy with the product."
5,Best Tea Pot Ever,I absolutely love this electric kettle! I use it every day and know it saves me money on my light bill as I don't use my stove to heat water anymore.
5,Nice Kettle,I really enjoyed my electric kettle until I went off and forgot about it and probably burned out the electrical components. I only put the minimum amount of water and should have probably just filled it to the Max level. If you put minimum be sure to stick around to watch otherwise it won't shut off. Will just have to purchase another.
4,A Good Purchase Overall,"I bought this because I drink a lot of hot tea and I was concerned about using the microwave too much. My only real disappointment is that I was expecting it to boil the water a little faster. I think it may be slightly faster than boiling the water on my gas range, though, so I'm not sorry that I made the purchase. I love that it turns off automatically a few seconds after it reaches the boiling point. As someone else pointed out, be sure the top is pressed down securely before pouring the water, as it tends to leak if it's not."
4,Heats water very fast!,It is faster than the microwave. The only drawback is that the cord fits too loose and has to be wiggled into place.
4,Great Kettle,The electric kettle is very efficient. It heats water quickly and keeps in warm for a long time. It turns off as soon as it starts boiling which is nice.
5,Great tea kettle!,When I bought this I was looking for something that would make it easier for me to make my afternoon cup of tea and now I use it for everything. Anytime I need to boil water I get this out. It is faster and easier than boiling on the stove. I would defintly buy this again. I just wish they had it in another color.
2,Very disappointed,"Heated water very quickly and was perfect for making a cup of coffee, but worked less than two months, the on/off switch broke. Not worth the investment; a very short-term appliance."
4,Good quality.,"Good quality so far, has used for 2 weeks and didn't break yet.It took <2 mins to boil the water, no bad at all."
4,Great price and functionality.,"I was looking for a compact electric kettle that would be good for travel. The Proctor Silex K2070Y 1 Liter Electric Kettle was the best choice I could find, and the price was very attractive. It is a very useful and mostly well-designed unit. Lightweight, compact, easy to see the water level, easy to see the ""on"" light, and fast. Two and a half minutes to a boil (filled at the minimum level; enough for one large cup). The only down side is the on-off trigger sticks up and might break off during travel, and the pouring screen (inside the spout) is not very secure. It has come loose several times inside the pot. All-in-all, a very good product."
4,Good kettle,"Cheap and light. As good as you wish under such price. A little bit plastic flavor in the water, but I don't care much."
2,Time consuming,"I bought this product at a very reasonable price, but it takes a long time to heat up. I could microwave a cup of water faster than the kettle heats up."
3,Good little unit,"This unit works well for heating water. It is fast and does no take up much space. My only CAUTION, is that heating water is all you can do. With the heating coils exposed this is a unitasker. I should have gone more expensive for a unit that did more. Not this products fault."
2,concerned on water purity,"Pros:* boil water very fast and hot* cheap* auto shut off* easy to see water level and love the light that shows it's boilingCons:This is the 2nd winter I'm using this boiler. Well, my water doesn't taste plastic like some other reviewer. Yet, when I examined the kettle, I saw that the ""heat cord"" inside the kettle (most precisely, the cord is immersed by the water) is dis-colored and looked that the coating of the cord is partially gone. Also, it seems like there is some deposits on the heat cord as well. So, I'm really worried that it may contaminate the water."
2,on-off sensor stopped working,"This product worked well for about two months of daily use, but then the on-off sensor stopped working causing the water to continue boiling until the electrical cord is unplugged from the wall outlet. While it is a nice, small kettle, it is inconvenient to have to plug it for use and unplug it afterward. I would have given it 4 stars had the sensor not malfunctioned."
5,Review,"I have burned up many tea pots, so when I saw this I had to try it. I love it! The water gets hot very fast and you don't have to worry about the pot burning up with the auto shut off."
3,Nice small electric kettle,I bought this to use in my office when I make some tea. It does very good job --the only inconvenience that I found is that the cord is rather short so I needed to buy an extension cord to use it.
3,Ot's OK,"Very nice simple kettle. But...... Electric cord is not comfortable. it is in the back side of base, can not to turn to the wall and hid."
1,does not last,"I bought this awhile ago and now I am back on Amazon to buy another ""hot pot"" because this did not last. I was very diligent about emptying it everyday of any left over water. It just stopped which has irritated me so I am going to buy something else for low bucks."
3,"Pretty good, but more expensive might be a better value","I've had a braun electric water kettle for years, have used it daily for tea, and I've always loved it, but when I needed another one for my office, I thought I'd get something cheaper, and the reviews here are so good.So I got the K2070. First of all, it does boil water.I'm sure after a few months (I've only had it a month) the toxic plastic smell in the water will dissipate. Eventually I'll learn to not let my hand slide too high on the handle so it doesn't (repeatedly) get burned by venting steam. And I'll realize that setting the boiler down on the floor because it only has a four foot cord is fine. I'll get used to waiting a while for a single cup of water to boil. And the scaling, I know it's usual.If I had to chose again, though, I would spend the extra 25 on another Braun because it's perfect. totally perfect."
1,Does not shut off automatically,"I have had this kettle for less than a week. In that week the automatic feature that shuts off the kettle when the water boils has stopped working. Also, it is hard to completely close the kettle top. Would not recommend this kettle at all."
5,Preparing Tea: Kettle vs Microwave,"I'm a huge tea drinker. I was starting to get annoyed with waiting on my water to boil for my tea, which was holding me up from using the microwave to prepare oatmeal in the mornings. Thankfully, I found this. This kettle does a quicker job at heating my water up for tea than my microwave, which is crucial because my mornings are rushed as it is. Now, I can drink my tea and also keep the microwave for something like oatmeal or leftovers for quick breakfasts.Here's a quick comparison test I ran for 2 cups of water:Microwave - 4 minutesKettle - 1min 30 sec (boiling!)It's about 2 - 2 & 1/2 times faster at heating the same amount of water! It hasn't given me any problems so far. I definitely recommend for frequent tea drinkers."
4,Almost perfect. Almost,"This is fantastic for the price. I use it average 3x a day.The only reason I didnt rate it 5 stars is the cord could be a little longer.Extremely reliable, fast to boil water, its really great. i would recommend it to anyone"
1,Cheap kettle did not last even light usage,"Tea or coffee tasted fine but if you were to drink just the hot water it tasted foul; never known that before?The on/off switch broke today; so after around 3 or 4 months I find myself spending more money on a new one. I only used it 2 or 3 times per day, usually for a small amount of water, so there was no excessive usage problems.I have used electric kettles all my life, and this is the first one that I have had a problem with. Cheap & nasty, I will be paying a little extra this time for something that will last."
4,Great kettle with one flaw,"The only flaw of this product is that the markings on the side of the kettle have absolutely no relation to reality - the 2 and 4 cup markers on the side (which aren't in the Amazon picture but are on the product) don't appear to correspond to any definition of 'cup' I can think of. If you want to boil a precise amount of water, you'll need to measure it in a different container, but as far as the boiling functions, this works perfectly. It shuts off when the water boils, has a nice (but ridiculously short, maybe 3' excluding plugs) detachable cord, and the handle stays nice and cool even when the kettle is full."
4,I really like it,"It's light and easy to handle. water level is great to see. Boils quickly, and auto shut-off is great. overall I recommend it to family and friends."
5,Electric Kettle,"One of the best things I ever bought for myself. I love this. I drink instant coffee and hated boiling water and heating my house. This is perfect. I use it absolutely every single day. I do not know how I lived this long without this product. I will never not have one of these in my home ever again. Only flaw is there are some sharp edges on the inside and you have to be careful when cleaning, but it only takes once to figure this out and to avoid that pain again. This is a wonderful product."
2,Very Disappointed,"I bought the same product 4 years ago and made use of the Kettle almost every day for 4 years. The cord was eventually frayed so I purchased a ""replacement"". This product is far less superior to the original. The first clue is when you pick up the kettle, it feels like very cheap plastic - much lighter than the original. The largest problem is that you have to really push down on the top to close it so the kettle can automatically turn off when it boils. If you fail to do so, the kettle will keep boiling. It feels like you will almost break the top when you push down - it just feels ""cheap"". The cord is about 1/2 the length of the last cord -- which is very annoying when you are working in a small kitchen. The handle feels like it will separate in a few weeks time - again - just feels ""cheap"". I am torn about returning this item but I figure it's time to move onto a better quality kettle."
3,Quick heat-up; metal bar peels off,"Overall, this is an average, working water kettle. I've got to say that it has served me and my family well for the past two years. As a quick summary, here are the pros and cons:Pros:- Low price- Quick heating system- Durable plasticCons:- The metal bar inside the kettle begins to peel after 6 months- A hint of plastic smell in the boiled water"
4,"Especially handy, but be careful","This is perfect for camping where you have utilities. I also use it to make soup in a dorm room. It heats up remarkably quickly and makes enough hot water to serve 2 or 3 people. Turns off before it overheats and doesn't take up very much space. It collects hard-water buildup rather quickly, especially on the coils, but letting vinegar soak in it for about 45 minutes and rinsing it out well every few weeks cleans up the hard-water stains. The hinge on the lid isn't especially robust. I wasn't sufficiently cautious with mine and broke the hinge. It glued back together pretty well though."
3,Beats the Microwave,This product works well. It boils the water and keeps me from having to heat water up in the microwave over. I use it at work... grave yard shift.
3,Just ok,"I am somewhat underwhelmed by this product.The main drawbacks are:1. The power cord is very short and basically requires an extension.2. The kettle comes in one part as opposed to better designed ones where the cord is attached to the base only, allowing one to pour cord-free.3. The construction is flimsy, does not feel as though this will last long under normal use.On the other hand:1. It is able to bring water to a boil and then switch off which is after all what's required.2. Not expensive and compact."
3,Did Not Auto Shut-Off,"These pots heated up quickly, but did not auto-turn off as indicated in sales blurb."
5,We bought three of it!,"We've bought three of the same product. One for home, one for my husband's office, and one for my school dorm. And I think it a good gift for single friend. It does the job well and I cannot think of anything to complain."
2,Not good for boiling again fast,"One big problem with this model - let's say you boil water once and you want to boil more water a little while later, the kettle won't let you turn it on. It's almost like the sensor setting is set to be too sensitive. Otherwise, water boils quickly"
5,Wow,"Very happy with this product. Functions exactly as advertised. I know others complained about a plastic taste, but I rinsed it out a few times before I started using, and empty out all unused water. As for the short cord, keeping it short is a safety thing. I think the cord is about 2 feet long. Is someone trying to walk to their bedroom with it still plugged in? As far as I'm concerned I just robbed Amazon. I would pay twice as much for this machine. It is WAY under priced for what you get."
1,smells like toxic plastic,boiled liquids smell like toxic plastic.... I really wish I had listened to the other reviewers before buying this item.
3,Okay product,"I got it very quickly, which was good. I've used it a lot since I purchased it, but already there is something wrong with it. The lighted on/off lever used to switch completely off, but now it's like it takes an intermediate step and slipe in between being on and off. Seems dangerous unless I'm aware of where it is in the heating cycle."
5,My most low maintenance appliance,"I bought this elsewhere a good 3 or so years ago and use it frequently (a couple times per week on average). It still runs great, have never really needed to wash it (I only boil water in it), and despite there being a loose connection where the AC cord plugs into the unit (a common issue) it still works reliably and effortlessly. What can't everyone be this easy ;-)"
2,Good for The Price,I bought it because it was on sale for $12.99. It does the job. Every time I open the plastic lid I feel I will break it. Just a few tiny screws locking a very thin plastic lid (the boiling high temperature makes me feel worse).I believe it's not a good idea to boil water in plastic containers. Stainless or glasses is much safer and healthier. But they costs a lot more.
1,Would you like some water with your plastic?,"This kettle is made entirely out of plastic. So you are essentially boiling your water in plastic. They say not to put plastic in the microwave, so my guess is you probably shouldn't boil your water in plastic, either. The reason the water tastes like plastic is because it's chock full of the stuff! Better to stick with a stainless steel kettle and have peace of mind about your health."
4,Hot but Slow!,"I bought two different electric kettles - one for home and one for work. I use this one for work and today I finally used it after finalizing all the initial prep to start using it. If i had used this kettle first I am confident I would not have thought anything of the product however with it being observed second to my other one, this one is muchhhhhh slower! I will say this too, I poured water in my travel mug for tea and started working and then took a drink about 7/8 minutes later - my tongue almost came off b/c that water was so hot!!!! :( Unbelievable how hot it was. I say all that to say for the inexpensive cost it is well worth it - automatic shut off, removal plug once done, and smaller sleek design. ENJOY."
1,"Cheap, fast but imparts a plastic smell and flavor to the water",Although I've owned this kettle for several years I stopped using it shortly after purchasing because the water boiled in the kettle has an off-flavor. I've done all kinds of things to try to clean the kettle but it seems to be due to the materials used in its constructions. It's inexpensive and fast but I'm sorry to say that it's now in the trash. I'd like my teas and coffees to taste the way they're meant to taste and if I go to the trouble of filtering my water I see no point in boiling it in this kettle.
3,Two Year Lifespan,"When I got this I loved it, it was super easy to use, had the auto-off and it worked well. Now, just a couple months shy of two years of nearly daily use, it died. Towards the end, over the last couple months the auto-off stopped working, first it would click off after the water had been boiling for a few seconds too long, and then later it stopped pretty much all together. Then one day I flipped the switch on and nothing happened. It's a sad day.For the price I'd say it was worth it for nearly two years of use, but I'm very tired of buying products with such limited life-spans. I hate having to dispose of these short-lived items and the stress of how to dispose of a broken electric item (recycle, garbage, recycling center, etc). I'm now willing to spend more on a product with the hopes that it'll last longer than only two years and that's why I won't buy this product again."
3,Calcium inside,"American water has a lot of calcium in it. So, if it dries up, you can see the white material on a surface. Like that, after I use this electric kettle, I can see a white material around electric heating product in it. It is so uncomfortable for me."
1,The coil is on the inside not hidden,This model has a big coil in the middle that is submerged in the water. I prefer the invisible type so I'm returned it.
2,"Yes, odor & taste","I bought one of these a several years ago and the strong odor and taste have only gotten worse. The tea kettle is a workhorse and I've had no mechanical issues whatsoever, but I finally am realizing and doing something about the fact that I have been drinking whatever I am smelling! I recycled it last week and am sad to see it go.For reliability and functionality, I would give it 5 stars, but for health issues, I'd give it one. I'm weighing health over the other and so will give it 2 stars."
1,Cheap product,Proctor Silex K2070. A very unsatisfactory product It ceased to function after 21 days of use. ( it did not boil dry)
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this electric kettle. Strong plastic taste and smell. The electrical cord 'shorted out' within the first week. The electrical cord is very short so you have to place your kettle next to an outlet unless you use an extension cord and unplug it to pour. Not practical for the work/office environment. I would not recommend this product. It did ship on time as promised.
5,Excellent Little Kettle,"It may only have a one litre capacity, but that is plenty for my uses. I thoroughly enjoy this little kettle. Much easier and faster than a stove top type kettle."
3,You get what you pay for,"It's probably better if you don't use it everyday, but in the winter I am drinking tea almost everyday. It works fine, but eventually you will see that the metal from the coil starts to wear off and the plastic starts to melt. Also not very easy to clean."
2,Not Great,"I didn't like the burning plastic smell coming from this item while it boiled water. But if that doesn't bother you, it works well, heats up fast and doesn't take up a lot of room."
1,plastic-flavored water gives me a headache,"Our unit produces boiled water with an unpleasant plastic flavor and smell. I occasionally also notice faint white foam on the surface that never evaporates or goes away. Drinking the water gives me a mild headache.Later we bought a kettle with a stainless-steel interior, and the headaches went away.The manual warns you that the first few times you boil water with it, the water will have a ""plasticky"" flavor. In our experience, that flavor never went away. We boiled water in it at least 20 times, using filtered water, and noticed the same problem."
4,Good Electric Kettle,"This Electric Kettle is quite simple without any frills. For the price, it does what it claims to do. It boils water quickly , the water level is easy to see and has the auto-shut off feature. I have used it reliably to boil water for tea, oatmeal etc. The water is quite hot, so use caution when pouring it out. The lid , can sometimes be hard to close & open."
1,"Strong, ""plastic"" taste won't go away","Have used the Bodum electric kettle for travel for years, but decided I'd purchase this Proctor Silex for the office since it was a few bucks cheaper. That was a mistake.Despite boiling and dumping out the water a half-dozen times, the water itself STILL tasted like ""plastic."" Ick. As a tea drinker, the quality of the water is key. Also, I found the general shape difficult to handle, the lid was hard to open, and when gently pouring the water it consistently (and dangerously) sloshed out the sides near the spout.Anyway, I ended up giving this one away and buying an additional Bodum electric kettle for the office. It's working great, just like the 10-year-old Bodum I take traveling. (I think it's also interesting to note that the classic, no-frills, usable design of the Bodum has remain unchanged in the past 10 years - Hey, if it ain't broke, don't 'fix' it.)"
5,Highly recommended,I bought two of these. One for home and one for the office. Had them for about a month. Items work great. No longer have to worry about the water because it works as advertised and quickly. Just make sure you follow the instructions that came with it and you won't be disappointed. There was plastic smell the first couple of uses but has gone away for the most part. Also note that it has a three prong plug. Very pleased with it.
1,Does not last long,"The on / off switch went bad after 4 months of daily use. The taste was very off...the plastic taste was very pronounced. Also, very easy to burn from steam leak when moving to pour and from over slosh of boiled water when pouring. Very dissappointing! A total waste of money...I will be replacing with one that is stainless or glass."
5,I tried cooking soup with it,"and it got all rusty on the metal coil which transfers heat to the water, so I had to trash it. Good buy though, just don't put any junk in the kettle except for pure water."
3,You get what you paid for,"It's tiny. The only way to carry the kettle is to unplug the cable from the back of the unit. It gets extremely hot near the top. With that said, it does its job and after all, it did cost me only 10 bucks."
3,Small but works well,"While this kettle does heat the water fairly quickly, I thought it was going to be a little bigger. It says it makes 6 cups, but in reality it makes about 2 1/2. I'm not sure what their measuring standards are, but they aren't the same as mine. So sometimes I just fill it a few times in order to get the amount of hot water I need."
2,Died after two uses,"It seems like a good kettle, but mine stopped working after the second use. I tried changing outlets and resetting the plug but nothing fixed it so I'm returning the item."
2,short life span,"Useful item for heating water, and worked very well at first; but after short time, stopped working - would not heat."
4,Excellent tea kettle,"This is an excellent electric tea kettle for the price. I was a little nervous purchasing it, given the reviews stating that there's a strong plastic taste and smell. When I received the kettle, there was a very strong plastic smell. I first washed the kettle with some dish soap, then boiled 2 kettles of water, per the instructions. Since then, the plastic smell is barely noticeable and haven't tasted it in my tea. I suppose it's possible that some people might be much more sensitive to the plastic smell, but for me, there are no issues."
4,Good and quick hot water!,"This electric kettle allows me to have hot water for tea, soups, and baking in about a minute and a half. There is no waste and it is cool to the touch. Awesome product!"
4,Great Fast Convenient,"Great electric pot. Have had two. Ordering a third. First pot I have had for years. It *is* very fast. I have never tasted any plastic or any other after taste from these things (I use good filtered water). It consistently automatically turns off. Very good for office or basement bar.My only complaint is that after years of use, there are some deposits in it that I cannot clean up because I cannot get around the heating element. But, um, its like $16?? Years of use, excellent performance.... fine! I'll buy another one."
5,Great Electric Kettle,"The Proctor Silex electric Kettle was just what I was looking for. It brings water to a boil faster than the microwave! Perfect for tea drinkers or any recipe that calls for boiling water. The best feature is the automatic shut off! No worries about ""Did I unplug it?"" I recommend it highly!"
5,This is one great hot pot!,My family loves this thing so much that I actually had to give mine to my mother and buy us a new one! I just bought number two and I am sure it will be as safe and easy to use as the previous one. Great product!
5,Awesome product with a great price!,"This product is used daily by either my co-workers or myself. It is quick, convienent and produces boiling HOT water in minutes! I highly reccommend this electric kettle."
4,Good and easy tool,"This is a very good and convenient kettle for my house and we no longer needed to watch the water boiling, which wastes much time and lets us worry about burning out the pot or the kitchen.It only takes a few minutes to get water done. The only bad thing is the cord is too short that I have to pull off it every time to pour water; one time I was too busy and forgot to pull off, the hot water spilled on my hand and got badly burned."
3,Cheap and Cheerful,This kettle is not very expensive and is perfectly adequate but not great. It takes quite a long time to boil. It's also pretty flimsy feeling. It holds enough water for a few cups of tea. It has no base so must be plugged/unpluged to take to the tap. We bought it because we're only here for 3 months and buying anything but the cheapest seemed a bit silly. If I wanted a longer-term relationship with my kettle I'd probably get something a bit more sturdy/faster to boil/with a base to avoid fiddling with the wire.
4,no complain,This is very convenient and user friendly. It's cheap and does the job without any problems. No complain!
4,The kettle is good except a smell of plastic,"My kettle was broken several days ago but I have to boil tea. I bought this one and it is delivered on time. The product is good and I like that it is automatically shut off when the water is boiled. However, I used it for several times but the smell of plastic still hasn't gone."
2,plasic taste,"After 40 cups of tea that damn plastic taste wont go away. I wonder if its bad for my health. Well if i dont give another review in 12 months,you will know im dead"
5,"Great kettle, great price","This is a great electric kettle and a competitve price, even with shipping. The only negative is that it does not have a detachable base, so you must pour with the whole thing still attached to the wall, but as long as you are plugged in near your power source it's fine. Heats water fast; so far, so good."
2,Would've expected better,"It works alright, but it has a big problem IMO. Normally with kettles, the power cable is connected to a platform which the kettle is put on. This makes it much more convenient to pick the kettle up, take it somewhere and bring it back without unplugging and plugging it, which is a cumbersome thing to do. This kettle doesn't have that.Also, I don't really like the taste of water boiled by this kettle, but I'm not sure if it's the tap water here or something wrong with the plastic of the kettle. If I had the choice now though, I would probably try another kettle."
5,excellent,"Love this electric tea kettle. Fast, easy & convenient. Only thing I didn't like, was the cord is only like 18"" long."
1,"Maybe I'm just dumb, but...","The wiring inside was strange and I'm not a fan of how cheaply made it felt. Hate to be a negatron, but this product was kind of a letdown."
2,A working kettle,"The kettle works OK but I have two problems with it. Firstly, you have to really slam the lid shut tight (instead of having it closed but not to the far end), otherwise it won't stop heating automatically and will keep boiling till all water evaporates. That happened to me during the first use. Secondly, there is always this very annoying plastic smell in my water. I am not sure if that is because of my water quality (maybe something is in my water and reacting with the plastic?) or because of the poor plastic quality of the kettle. But I am quite sure a good kettle would be made from inert quality plastic and not make water smell like melted plastic soup."
3,good cheap kettle,"I got my PS kettle about 6 mos. ago. It works quite well, particularly for the price. The few complaints I have are:1. Cord length is a bit too short2. It doesn't pour very well if you are trying to pour more than just a mild trickle. It seems to go around the screen mechanism and spill out. You can remove the screen though.I use distilled water which lacks some of the flavor of regular and spring water due to having the minerals removed. When I tried using spring water, the minerals got crusted onto the heating element and the water I heated for a time thereafter was a bit cloudy and funky looking. Not a big deal, but something to keep in mind. You might not have as big a problem with this if you always keep the heating elements covered by water (I generally just heat the minimum amt of water at a time)."
5,Nice Machine,Works well! Heats water very quickly and is convenient to use. The price is great and is well worth the cost!
5,excellent,perfect for making hot tea - a must for any tea drinker. Got one for my mom as well for Christmas.
4,"Simple, cheap, works!",This product is super simple but gets the job done. Ths kettle is perfect for an avid tea or hot chocolate drinker. I love to use it for instant oatmeal or noodles as well.
3,Doing it's job but water smells plastic.,Everything is fine with the kettle besides its bad smell. I've tried lots of things to getting rid of the plastic smell but I couldn't succeed.
3,Not a big fan of plastic taste,You can taste the plastic. Should have opted for the stainless steel versions. Also the power cord is really short. Other than those two things the product is fine.
1,a weird smell,"when i use it to make hot water, the water smell like something weird......i am thinking of return it. it is a horrible product."
4,I love this thing...,"I received this as a gift in March 2010. It is compact, not ugly, and very easy to operate. The only two things that could make this better are: I wished it dinged or made a sound when it was complete and I wish it held a little more water.Seriously, if you are making hot water for tea or instant coffee for two people this thing is GREAT!"
3,You get what you paid for,"I bought this kettle because of its size and price. It was really hard to find something moderately priced with 1 Quart capacity. It is not too bad for the price - it has nice look, good form factor, and automatic shut off. However, I still feel the smell of plastic in boiled water after one month of use."
1,Gives water a plastic taste,"The plastic taste to the water is a deal-breaker for me. Tastes like water from a garden hose that's been sitting in the sun all day. Blech.Otherwise, it does heat the water quickly. Great for heating water you're not going to drink."
4,"Overall very good product, one minor flaw","I purchased this product to use mainly for tea, oatmeal, ect for just myself, so the size is perfect. While the outside does get warm, it's not dangerously so, and that's good because I am living in a tent on deployment! The only drawback for me is that the lid doesn't open very far, only a few inches, so it's a little tricky to get in it to wipe out any dust that always finds it's way inside in this environment. Otherwise, it works quickly and stores very easily."
4,Good kettle,I like this kettle. It heats up quick and is sturdy. The lid has a great hinge and the weight feels good to handle. I do wish that the cord was a little longer.
5,Great for WaterPic and Shaving Water,"I love my little Proctor Silex electric kettle. It's great for bathroom locations that require quite a wasteful draw of slowly warming water before getting some decently hot water. In less than a minute, I can warm up enough water to fill my WaterPic reservoir with lukewarm water so I don't have to endure the discomfort of WaterPic-ing with cool or cold water. It's also great for really hot shaving water, whether I'm adding to the already somewhat hot water I have in the sink, or pouring it straight from the kettle into the empty sink. I also leave some hot water aside in the Proctor Silex to pour over the cutting head of my razor blade and the cutting block and foil of my electric razor. This is really effective at removing shaving cream residue, etc. Oh, and the hot water from this little kettle is also great for cleaning the sink when I'm done."
2,Broke in 3 months,"I have used this electric kettle product 2-3 times in a week, but stop working after 3 months of use."
3,electric kettle,"worked well. plugged in and boiled water instantly. only comment, too much to put a whistle to alert me when water has boiled??"
5,"Reliable, inexpensive, makes a great gift",Tea and hot chocolate is so easy to make with this unit. Water heats up quickly.
5,I like it,"The price is competitive. Though the shipping rate is a little bit high, I understand.What I like it best is that the kettle automatically turns itself off when the water is completely boiling.This provides more safety."
3,still waiting,"well i recieved this product and it works but the water smells like plastic. i read another reviewer that said i had to heat up several pots before that went away so i have to do that. there is an open steel coil inside, i'm assuming to heat the water, is that usual? never had one so i'm not sure. it did heat the water though. it makes a noise while heating up but i read thats expected. dunno.. have to get back to you on this one."
1,Broke within a week,This piece of crap broke in 4 days without any heavy usage. Be prepared to watch it die. This is cheap for a reason. Piece of crap!
3,Good Value,"A good value, but the cord is very short and I have to unplug it every time I want to move around our small kitchen with it."
4,Good for the price,"This electric kettle has been working fine and as expected thus far. Given the price, it's better than I expected."
1,DID NOT WORK,"Got this electric kettle prior to going on a trip- it arrived the day before I left and it did not work at all.It's a small size, but cheap quality and clearly cheap electronics. DO NOT BUY!"
3,A decent kettle -- does the job,"In many ways, this is a great little kettle. It heats quickly, and the dual water levels are easy to read. I'm not bothered by the exposed heating element; that likely poses little danger (especially with the auto-off feature). Only after purchasing it did I wonder whether it was wise to use a plastic kettle for everyday use. (It's probably fine; it's just my personal feeling.) So I keep it in my office and use it from time to time, but it's not my main kettle right now (the kettle proper of my main unit is made of glass)."
1,No warmer on pot,"I bought this tea pot 1 month ago and I have not been happy with it. The biggest reason that I bought a tea pot is becasue I drink a lot of tea and I hate to have to get up an leave my desk to make another cup of tea. I thought that I would have a whole pot of hot water by my desk. Alas, this pot does not keep the water hot like a coffee pot! By the time I finish drinking my first cup and go for a refill the water is already luke warm and cold by the third cup :-(I should have just bought a coffee pot becasue it keeps the water hot for a couple hours."
3,It's okay,"This Proctor Silex is an amazing product, very compact but only works on 110 volts...i would give it 5 stars if was also 220 volts."
2,Plug Is Bothersome,"I wish I would have seen how the plug attaches to the kettle; you have to unplug it to move it around the kitchen and when you're cooking this can be a hassle. I was spoiled with an old one that sat in it's heater so I could just lift it up when I needed it and I miss that small difference very much. Would not have bought it had I realized otherwise. Is smaller too, but that is because I didn't read it well enough, a bit too eager to get it in my home. The lid is a bit difficult to maneuver too, it requires being pushed open from the front so basically a two hand job-again slowing you down in your dinner dance. Thus you get 2 stars Proctor Silex kettle."
4,Proctor Silex K2070 1-Quart Automatic Electric Kettle,"Seems to be a decent electric kettle for the price. Definitely worthwhile to have one for the office.As was mentioned previously, there is a plastic smell, but I'm going to boil water and let it sit, regularly reheating it, to see if that will help.Regarding cord length, yes it comes with a ridiculously short cord. Fortunately, they used a standard socket, so you can use a generic computer power source cord of whatever length you want.Edit: It appears I can't change my rating, but I would rate this a lot lower and I wouldn't buy it. I just can't get the plastic smell out and it ruins the water, making this product useless."
3,Thinner and Narrower than I Expected,"I bought this float when I learned that the one I really wanted from another company was out of stock until after the summer ended. The float is basically fine, except it is a little narrower and a little thinner than I expected. I ultiumately was able to get the originial Frontgate float that I had wanted, and it is considerably wider and thicker for about the same cost."
3,Colored coating already damaged,"This float is nice but when it arrived there was already one small tear in the colored plastic coating and many bubbles in the coating which have led after a week of fairly gentle use to even more small rips and tears. These do not effect the float's buoyancy but I am afraid it seems likely that the float will be too worn and unattractive for use next year. It seemed rather expensive, although cheaper than many, and so this is a big disappointment. Unless you weigh about 90 pounds or less you will also get wet lying on this float as it does not have enough buoyancy to remain completely unsubmerged."
4,For ISDN/SS7/Syncronisation in one book the best,"If you need to know about the ISDN, network syncronisation and non-advanced SS7 this book is the best. It is a shame though that the book does not cover SS7 user parts such as SCCP,TCAP and due to date of publication does not have BISUP, Etc. The book is extremely well written."
1,Choral Music and Vocal Ensembles NOT SUPPORTED!!,"This company does not support Choral Music. Do not let the fact that they sell microphones and subscriptions to vocal ensembles mislead you. They do not have ANY choral music available to practice and have no plans to do so. This discrimination disappoints me. I cannot support a company that promotes discrimination.This company also makes Finale. After discovering their attitude towards Vocal Ensembles, I am making plans to switch from Finale to Sibelius. If you are a Choral Director, you should too. If you are a Band or Orchestra Director, it would be helpful if you pressured the company not to continue this discrimination."
5,Good and much cheaper than Phyto Defrissant,"I have always liked the Phyto straightening balm but have felt it is overpriced for what it is. I tried this Alterna product and am switching to it. It works just as well for me on reducing frizziness and generally smoothing my hair, and costs less."
1,Not worth the money :(,"I purchased the Alterna Hemp Straightening Balm about two weeks ago and it arrived in a timely manner. That's about the only positive thing I can say unfortunately.I have very thick wavy hair. And using as directed this product leaves much to be desired. Did not help with straightening at all. It also did not help with the frizziness or fly-away hairs either. I used on towel dried hair and also kept reapplying as I straightened with my flat iron and comb. My hair continued to curl and was a frizzy mess afterward. I also tried using the product simply with a blow dryer and paddle brush and had the same results.Paul Mitchell's Super Skinny Serum is a much better way to go. It works great and leaves my hair shiny, tame, and STRAIGHT!!I really feel like I threw 19 dollars in the garbage!Maybe this product would work well on someone who's hair is not as thick as mine but who knows.If you have very thick hair that's curly or wavy I would definitely go with a different product!!"
3,ok,"not much different than all the other straightening products out there, after trying tons of products, I still haven't found one that does the job well"
5,great product!!!,"Amazing product!! It shipped earlier than expected! I tried it right away. It's easy to use too! All I had to do was wash my hair with my regular shampoo and conditioner, then dried my hair a little and applied the product. I blew dry my hair and when it was dried, my hair looked amazingly straight! Just the way I like it! It didn't make your hair flat, it was just perfect. I was surprised in a good way when I saw how big the product was! It smelt nice too! Overall rating, 5 stars! Shipped fast, great result and easy to use!"
3,Gave away,Not sure about this product - only used it once but my hair was fly away after using it. Think I used too much. Hair felt silky after using it though. Gave it to my sister who has very frizzy hair and she says she likes it. I will have to buy another to try again now that summer is fast approaching. Received as scheduled.
4,I like it!!,"This is a good product overall, it does not leave my hair any straighter but at the same time it helps with my split ends and makes my hair look healthier when i use it. Plus it smells great. thx"
1,This is not the Lilydale I know and love.,"Christine Wicker missed the opportunity of a lifetime when she was given the honor of writing about Lilydale. This community is over 120 years old and all she can do is put down every idea, word and person she encounters. She provides no background on how Lilydale was ever started, continued to thrive or even does so today. The book is very unbalanced and hard to follow. She doesn't seem to understand the messages of love often given but instead seems to think the winning lottery numbers would be more appreciated.Lilydale has never let reporters inside. They surely must regret their decision. I'm throwing my copy in the fireplace."
3,Odd omission,"I found it strange that there was no reference in this book whatsoever to the Natalie Merchant-penned song titled ""Lilydale"", from the 10,000 Maniacs' CD _The Wishing Chair_. Perhaps there was a copyright issue, but I would have thought that the author would have at least made mention of such a thing. That song was my first reference to Lily Dale, and made me interested in this book."
5,Good Book.......,"Good Book.......I live 2 hours from Lilly Dale, New York. It's a place like no other!~ The book was a treat to learn more about the history of this unusual place."
4,A skeptical journalist,"Fascinating. A journalist goes to Lily Dale, a town founded by and made up by mediums, and tells about what she learned. What I really liked about the way this is written is that even though this turns into a self-discovery journey for the author, not once does she attempt to convert the reader or dissuade the reader about what or what not to believe. She simply gives the facts of her observations, even going back and forth with what she thinks might be true or not true.Because it isn't a ""trying to convert"" style, it is a relaxing and interesting peak into what the spiritualist community is really like."
2,Not Really About Lily Dale,"I judged the book by its cover and by the insert of historic photos within the book. I expected the book to give me more history of Lily Dale and the Spiritualist movement. It's mostly about the author's one summer in Lily Dale. The story continually comes back to the author's life, perceptions, etc. instead of exploring some of the profound experiences some people in town had. I think a big opportunity was missed.Additionally, as a man, I felt alienated. Wicker presented the story as a womens' club. I recognize the population of Lily Dale is predominantly female, but does that mean men have no place in spiritualism? There were some men present in the classes, though very few. So that makes the men in Lily Dale the real news. Why were they there? I don't know, it's not covered.The book is really more of a memoir of one skeptical woman's quest to find some kind of supernatural experience. I'm not even sure Lily Dale needed to be mentioned at all in this book."
4,A good starting place,"Recently I heard of Lily Dale for the first time, and this book provided a good introduction. (I wonder how it happened that Lily Dale, and the great Chautauqua Institution ... so alike and yet so different .... ended up almost in the same neighborhood!)The book is a LITTLE bit about Lily Dale history and the Spiritualist religion and a LOT about the town's inhabitants and the author's experiences over the course of her first summer there.I had some trouble keeping all the characters straight. Chapter headings, better organization, or photos of the residents might have helped with that. Nevertheless, following the author's thinking as she kept adjusting her belief system made interesting reading."
1,Like your light weight mp3 player? Don't buy this cd then!,"Do you like the convenience of carrying around a nice lightweight mp3 player with hundreds of your favorite songs on it? Well if so, don't buy this CD because it is copy controlled and you will not be able to rip it to mp3, wma or any other portable format. Unlike previous copy controlled CD's though, this one does come with a specially designed player that installs when you load the CD so you can listen to it on your computer. I love the kittens, but not enough to tote their CD's with me everywhere I go. Furthermore, the only CD player I have anymore is in my boat and it has an auxillary input for plugging in my mp3 player. I use the computer as my CD/DVD player in my house and at work. I really hope that the music industry doesn't think this will increase profits because my CD is on it's way back tomorrow for a refund.Buyer beware, make sure to check to see if a CD is copy controlled before you buy."
1,Review of Maitre de la Musique (The Music teacher),"The color copy was good - unfortunately, the sound did not match up exactly with the voices. This was disappointing. I would not recommend this product to future buyers."
4,review of Le Maitre de Musique,"If you do not like opera, do not get this film. If you LIKE opera, get this film for the music. There's arias and duets throughout the film. There's also stories of love and revenge between the arias and duets, but the main reason to get this film is the music."
1,Beware,"This brilliant film was butchered in Korea. It's dubbed into English, and comes with French subtitles. The singing is out of sync with the picture from the beginning. When you push ""English"" subtitles, they crudely appear over the French subtitles at the bottom of the screen. Ignore this one!"
3,A bit disappointed,I am short with heavy thighs. These fit okay but not as good as Catherine's around the hips. But other then that they were fine.
5,Addicting...,"Lots of fun whether you are 62 like myself or 4 like my grandson. Be aware however, it is QUITE addicting (in a FUN way though!)..."
3,Typical romantic comedy,I am an adult male and watched this with my wife. She liked it but I thought it was a typical romantic comedy. The story plot was typical and the ending is just the way my wife likes it.
3,Too many scratches,"I really enjoyed this movie, but there were too many scratches on the dvd, which made the movie skip and stall many many times throughout watching"
3,2 maybe 3 stars. 4th may 2004.,"Although it looks quite good by looking at the box, it isn't one of my best movies. I would say i enjoyed this film as little as babe2, even though they are comletely different. It is one of them slow movies about a woman[kelly preston] who dosen't really act in it much, and she goes away leaving her love of her life behind. He makes a friend[meg ryan]and i think he falls in love with her[must admit haven't seen it all the way through]but it is sooooooo borin if you don't like meg ryan. Like me."
2,A Little Too Mean For Its Own Good,"Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo are a New York City couple who come together after Preston leaves Matthew Broderick and Karyo uses Meg Ryan in order to get a Visa. Now Broderick and Ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex's. The problem is, the offenses they've endured (being dumped and being used) don't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people, especially Karyo. Which is probably why first-time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles. After all, how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry's Sally? Unfortunately, it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film is so uneven, and the script isn't particularly funny.There's a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy. Despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches, this film does not walk that line very well."
2,Pointless . .,"What a mess of a movie - Matthew Broderick is SO much better than this waste of time. Just a totally pointless movie. Well as long as Meg Ryan got in her little ""dance"" she does in every single one of her movies, I guess all is not lost."
2,Stalkers that need intense therapy!,"This show was meant to be a dark comedey, but it fell really flat. At first you sympathize with Broderick's character, but any woman who would use her dad to break up with you isn't worth crying over. He goes to NYC to try to win her back, and find she's gotten over him quickly and has a sexy new lover. He meets the new love's ex, Meg Ryan, and the two of them stalk and try to sabotage their ex's new romance in many creepy ways. I found this movie in extremely poor taste, and felt that in the end both Broderick and Ryan were creepy criminals who needed jail time and intense therapy! Once was more than enough, I would never watch it again!"
3,his is the perfect movie for boring a weekend.,"Pros:*Neat plot.*Good performances.*Humorous.*Creative (the spying scenes are spectacular).*Meg Ryan is simply the perfect romantic comedy star. She always glows, both talent-wise and beauty-wise.Cons:*Although Matthew Broderick was almost better than usual, he still is Matthew Broderick. He's still cold. It looks as if he has no feelings whatsoever, be they joy, surprise, sadness, anger, or whatever. He doesn't play them well.Bottom line: Humor-wise, it's excellent. The French guy is hilarious! Romance-wise, ok, but just ok, nothing more. Maybe if someone other than Matthew played the part...Matthew isn't that a good romanitc comedy star.Overall an entertianing experience."
2,"Meg Ryan attemps to be tough, Broderick is bland.","Personally this is my least favorite movie starring Meg Ryan. Meg does really good playing the tough biker girl, but the movie has a hard time catching up with her in every aspect. The acting is not very good on the exception of Meg. Matthew Broderick is very boring, bland, and overall bad. The plot is unrealistic, and all in all is only good to watch one time. One thumb down, and one thumb up for this movie. Sorry."
2,Deeply disappointing,"I bought this DVD in the UK because it was cheap... and because it had one of my favorite actors, Matthew Broderick, in it. What a pile of PANTS! Basically, Broderick's boring golden-girl of a mate, Kelly Preston, goes off to New York on a teaching stint and instead of coming back to him, sends a Dear John letter through her father. Of course, you can tell what happens next....Broderick rushes to New York and starts spying on his girlfriend and her new French lover...This is not a great film...the cast is awkward and lopsided, the plot is ridiculous, and the dialogue not zingy enough to even merit a second viewing. Two thumbs down."
4,The best! The ultimate revenge fantasy!,"I love this movie! Dark comedy at its best. Nice to see Ryan in a not so ""Miss Mary Sunshine"" role. Broderick was a wooden as ever but likeable nonetheless...especially when he flashes a smug expression reminiscent of those he was famous for in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.I loved watching the sneaky ex boyfriend get his much deserves comeuppance. You go girl! And there was a happy ending for both couples in the film...a nice was to balance all the dark notes in this comedy. Farafetched? Yes. Something normal people wopuld ever dare attempt? No way--unless they want to end up dead or in jail. But as far as revenge goes this is served up as sweet as pie. The ultimate revenge fantasy...I've seen it 3 times!"
3,True Romance,"There's a freshness to Addicted to Love that's long been absent from the romantic comedy genre. It takes a new angle in which paybacks become the ultimate art form of the jilted. The genial nature of the four leads keeps it interesting too. Even Ryan--never one of my favorites--is genuinely charming here, in a biker-chick sort of way. The happily ever after comes as expected, but the rocky road that takes us there is pleasantly unpredictable."
4,Meg and Matthew visit the Dark Side,"Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan are gifted comic actors, and they are entertaining in this dark comedy. While the characters begin the movie in a plot for revenge against their former lovers, their ridiculous and immoral plans explode. While the romance makes light of a serious problem (stalking), the movie itself is more sweet than bitter because of the characters' insights, failures, and romance. Neither Broderick's nor Ryan's best film, but definitely enjoyable if you are in the mood for a biting look at love."
3,"It's a ""French Kiss"" remake!!!","Think about it. Meg Ryan stars in a film about somebody's fiance going away on what's supposed to be a short trip. Instead, however, the fiance falls in love with a French person and decides to stay. So the other person follows them with the intention of winning them back, enlisting the help of somebody they meet upon arriving, and end up falling in love with that person who helped them! The plot of ""French Kiss"" or ""Addicted to Love""? Try BOTH! And while both films are different in other ways, I still say ""French Kiss"" is the superior of the two!"
5,Mysterious Music for Mysterious Filnm World,"This was one of the first albums I have found years ago with the film scores which Bernard Herrmann did for the movies of Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer. I knew I had to have this CD. These tracks were not from the movies, but new arrangements for the symphony audience. This does not detract on the artistry. Herrmann's power and creativity abounds in this collection. This album is a must-have for science fiction and fantasy fans. Bernard Herrmann can never be matched."
3,"Sans William Holden's Signature Performance, a Completely Unrealistic Movie.","Viewed: 1/13Rate: 51/13: William Holden shows why he is the star of Stalag 17 or why he is a great actor for that matter. What he did actually feels like a Supporting Actor performance to me. Forget everybody else in the cast. They are a dime a dozen. Of Stalag 17, I really have a hard time believing everything about the movie: the homosexual P.O.W.s, the caricature Germans, and the unrealistic set-up of the conditions of the concentration camp. The Great Escape is the film of choice for me. All in all, William Holden is the sole reason why Stalag 17 gets a lofty `5' from me; otherwise, it's a dud of a picture."
5,Stalag 17,One of the best war time movies. Great performances keep you interested as the characters play out the scenes. Good character development & suspense is tight.
3,It passes time.,"William Holden does a pretty good job or portraying a prisoner in a stalag during World War II.Unlike the TV program ""Hogan's Heroes"" this movie is more serious yet it has its amusing moments. However there is nothing to make this movie stand out past any other stalag escape films. It is more of a time passer.Maybe the play that this film was based on executed better?The Bridge on the River Kwai [Blu-ray] ~ William Holden"
5,Classic War,"Loved this old war show. It is as up-to-date today as it was back then. The sneakiness of people trying to change things is just like today, except in a different setting."
4,Very good but still faulty movie,"Sig Ruman (almost 70) really is too old for Schultz, the guard of the barracks. Schultz is made a little too sympathetic at times in this film (like when he shows concern for a beaten up Septin). The German Army should be more hateful in the film. The women near the camp could have had a better role too. Very good cast and story outside of these few problems."
1,let the buyer beware,"Warning; Just because Amazon tells you a film is in color, don't bet the farm that it will be in color as they advertised. So when you order a classic film that has been colorized and you wait a month for a movie that turns out to be black and white, just suck it up. Because Amazon isn't going to do a thing about it. Enjoy"
3,Not as bad as it looks from the cover!,"This is the first in the Vic Varallo series by Lesley Egan/Elizabeth Linington. Varallo moves from a small town to work on the Glendale California police department. He and his new wife were not expecting the cost of living to be quite so high, so they advertise for a tenant to take over the garage apartment. Their new boarder seems like a decent, quiet guy. Ross Duncan is an insurance salesman. Then his ex-wife is murdered and he's the chief suspect.Fortunately for Duncan, something about the case reminds Vic and partner Charles O'Connell of a old case written up in a book some time ago, the Wallace case. It sounds almost identical. So is it a frame? And if it is, who set it up?This book is dated in a lot of ways, the language, the prices given, and really the general tone of the book. But if you enjoy police procedurals or know anything about the Wallace case, you might enjoy this one. Out of print, but if you find a copy, it's worth reading.CMB"
2,Eva in science class?,"Don't let your middle school science teacher assign this maybe-interesting read to your class, gives it a grandiose position it doesn't deserve in the science community. Blurs the lines between humans/chimps, pretty scary for the 13 year old experiment, too squishy on the ethics and short on the science. Fine summer read, if you feel the urge to run wild through the jungle..."
3,"Interesting, but not that great...","You probably know the story line from some other reviews, so I'll just cut to the chase. Eva was interesting, and sometimes (and ONLY sometimes) did I really get engrossed in it. The whole story line seems a bit far-fetched, but the author almost tries to make it sound like the setting is in the near-future. The whole ""nerve memory"" thing just doesn't quite cut it with us cynical readers. And also, throughout the entire book, Eva made theories and assumptions that I believe are far beyond the reach of a thirteen year old. Dickinson should do a bit more research on young people (especially teenagers) before trying to create a believable character. Besides that, I thought that it was a mediocre book, if you like that kind of science-fiction, non-realistic type stories..."
1,A very weird book.,"This book was okay, but could have been much better. I think it skips around too much and at times, gives to many or too little details."
2,2 (Maybe 2.5) Stars; Mediocre,"Eva was a slow moving story, yet was interesting and thought-provoking. The plot was not very appealing, but since the story takes place in the future, some of the technology that is described is very interesting. Also, the procedures done to Eva make you think. Could it really happen in the future? Is it moral or ethical? All that was good in the book. The characters, on the other hand, were undeveloped (except maybe for Eva). In parts, the story seemed to be sloppily written. Also, I was disappointed with how the story ended. You might want quite a bit of time on your hands to read this book because it is not a page-turner. It is more like a read a page a day type of book. So if you are into Science Fiction (or blah) stories, try this book."
3,Eva :) :(,"I read Eva in a book report and to an 11 year old it was a very good book, but complicated to understand but had some great chapters and the basic storyline was wonderful. I enjoyed this read and so did my fellow classmates and we all agreed that we certainly could feel what the story was explaining and if the story wasn't so complicated I would rate it 4 1/2 stars but then again, maybe it wasn't for my age group!?!"
2,Could have been much better.,"The author brought up some interesting concepts that could have been made into a really good story, so I was excited to read it. (I love reading and I read all the time.) But he didn't do enough with these concepts and it was unsatisfying. Some parts were interesting and made you want to read more, but then it got boring again. It was ALMOST a good book. It was quite depressing as well--practically all animals are extinct, and humans are spontaneously commiting suicide (yeah, right)! The technology and science weren't really believable. I couldn't believe that Eva would become that much like a chimp when the scientists said they erased all of Kelly's memory. And since they didn't transplant Eva's actual brain (they just ""programmed in her neuron pathways"" or something), why did the chimp become Eva herself, instead of Kelly thinking like Eva? I am a real fan of Peter Dickinson's great book A Bone From A Dry Sea, so I'm hoping others of his will be better."
4,Eva - Not Your Typical Science Fiction Story,"The premise of this story may seem farfetched, but I found it to be a very interesting read. It's psychological and thought-provoking. The concept (a human mind inside a chimp body - and not all that was chimp is gone) is unique. The book may be marketed for young teens, but the writing is adult in its complexity and the fact that there is no kid-speak. Generally I prefer my science fiction to have spaceships and aliens, but I enjoyed this book and would read it again. I hope those who read the negative reviews of this book will keep an open mind and give it a chance (if they are fans of scifi). I think I understand the themes this book covers better now in my 40's than I would have as a teen. If you enjoyed ""Flowers for Algernon"", then my guess is that you would like this book."
2,i hated this book!!!!!!!,"this book was the stupidest most annoying book i have ever read! nothing exciting ever really happens and everything crawls along at an annoyingly slow pace. i really really didnt like it. soooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid. DONT READ IT the only reason i read it is because i had to for school. do anything you can, burn it, eat it, make it explode, but DO NOT i repete, DO NOT read this book!!!!"
1,Confussing,"This book was very strange. In the end, it was depressing. This book did not relly explan what was happening. I did not enjoy this book at all."
3,A Little Weird,I read this book some time ago 1-2 years ago for a required reading for school. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I mean the first few chapters where weird. But in the end it was. OK. Not the best but. OK. A Little confusing and boring at times. But not the worst. I would give it 3 stars.
3,"""An O.k book""","""Eva"" is a book about a girl named Eva who wakes up in a hospital bed,later finding out that she's in a body of a chimpanzee. If someone asked me what I thought about ""Eva"" by Peter Dickinson I would say that it wasn't what I expected. I say that because the beginning was good and the ending was good but it was the middle of the story that became a little boring. Altogether the beginning and end were written good, but the middle wasn't written as good as the beginning and the end. For someone who likes books about chimpanzees and surgeries and other medical ""stuff"" I recommend this book!"
2,Too Bad they don't have in stock,Showed in stock. Called to check if it really is. Nope. Just like all the other dealers.
3,I overpaid for this product.,"It is a good product but I just found it locally for $1.99. And a ""twang"" to your recipes. Keep it in the fridge after opening. I think I'm addicted to all things ginger!"
1,Not a Game for the Small Investor,"This book talks about the various factors affecting multi-million-dollar developments. The misleading pictures of Monopoly houses on the cover suggest small-scale residential investing, but the properties under discussion are the size of an entire Boardwalk. Frankly, the whole ""game"" analogy may sound like fun, but is nothing more than representing economic forces, e.g. the cost to borrow money, as ""cards"" one draws. Ho hum. If you don't have millionaire investors as friends or a job doing due dilligence for huge developments like shopping centers, warehouses, etc., this scale of this book is much too grand. We're talking buying entire city blocks in Manhatten! Disclaimer: Unlike other reviewers here, I'm not a former student of the Harvard Business School professor. This text may be quite relevant to their careers."
3,Interesting but not as useful as I would have liked,"The BOE chapter I found very interesting. It provided a nice quick way to go about looking at an investment in real estate. After this chapter the book begins to wane. The deals that Poorvu discusses in detail tend to be larger deals which are sometimes difficult to put into perspective if you're like me and looking at much smaller investments. I do think he does a good job of discribing what it's like to be a real estate ""player"", but as for providing you with useful tools you can take with you, read the BOE chapter."
1,don't bother reading.,"Can't recommend this book, thumb down. He tries to appeal to an advanced or institutional real estate audience but then gets bogged down trying to explain introductory concepts. An entire chapter is spent explaining NOI, which is explained everywhere else (and his audience would have an advanced understanding).On the other hand, if his audience is the general public, then most of what he writes is not of any benefit and possibly too advanced. The result is mushy generalities. If you want useful detailed real estate literature go to the specialty publishers/societies like ULI, BOMA, CRE, IREM, CCIM, ARES, PWC-Korpacz, and AI, not Barnes & Nobles."
5,Great Resource,"I was assigned this book for a course at my university. Even though I had a large amount of previous real estate development experience as well as education, this book was tremendous.Today it is probably one of my most referred to books filled with highlighted passages. I recommend it for all people interested in real estate, regardless of age or experience."
4,Good book,"A good read, with some interesting points. Presents a great overview of the subject for the novice. The experienced reader may find it to be a bit of an oversimplification. The case studies are good, too."
2,"Only ""war stories""","If you are looking for ""real learning"", skip this book. Some of the stories are interesting and do sometimes make for good reading, you won't lean any new skills from this book."
2,"Great text, awful publisher","This textbook is very well-written and quite comprehensive. It also has great practice problems that you can work on to understand the material. HOWEVER, the textbook does not contain an answer key in the back. A call to the publisher (Waveland Press) made me aware that the answer key is only available to instructors in colleges if they can proove that they are using this book as the class textbook. To me this is a rip-off, because normally publishers provide answer keys upon request. In Summary: Great book, terrible publisher. Waveland Press sucks! How am I supposed to self-study without the answers???!!!"
3,Look for the revision,"This is a great resource, however, check for the newest revision. I purchased this before I knew about the new revision. the new rev includes updates in addition to software. Also the revision is cheaper."
5,Excellent!!,The book was brand new when received and in excellent condition and hard bound.. Delivered quickly and efficiently.. will do business again with seller..
5,Great Price!,Bought these for my boyfriend for his Bubble Tea.He loves the straws. Shipping was fast! Great Quality and a nice price as well!
4,Don't know what color you're going to get.,"The straws themselves are great and exactly what I wanted. However, each package of 45-50 straws are the same color. If you order multiple packages, they will put packages of different colors in, but there's no way of knowing what you'll get."
1,Disappointing,Straws were much shorter than anticipated. They were bought to be used with smoothies but are too short for the intended purpose.
3,Shop for price. Only 40 pieces are included.,Saw the picture and didn't read the description. I received 40 straws and paid $4. That's 10 cents each. You can do better. Sold by Home of Coffee.
3,"Nice, but only one color.",The straws I received are perfect for bubble tea. But they are a different color than the display. Mine are red and clear striped.Another thing they are good for is curling dolls and My Little Pony's hair. I bought way more than I needed to.
3,Fat bubble tea straws,"The material that the straws were made of is very flimsy. I was not planning on using them as straws.As drinking straws, I'm sure they would be fine, but not sturdy enough for my use! I probably would not recommend to a friend."
5,Alternate use,Great little product. I actually used these to act as supports when I stacked a cake. Way easier than dowels to cut with the same results!
3,"fat straws, useful for smoothies","These are good straws, about 1/2 inch diameter and about 7.5 inch in length. The ones I received were hot purple in color, which is really not the color I would have chosen. I think 8 or 9 inch straws might be more useful if you intend to drink a smoothy directly out of the blender. And it would probably have been nice if the straw is somewhat translucent, which was not the case for the ones I received. That would be my next plan. But either way these straws are sturdy, and I often wash them by hand with cold water, soap, and a long wooden chop-stick to rub the inside clean. I do not put these straws in the dishwasher because the heat and the harsh detergents can release plasticizers from the plastic -- which would probably be unhealthy-- that is my guess. Because some plasticizers have the effect of feminine hormones (such as estrogen) on our tissues. I like these fat straws because I can use them to get my yogurt fix while I am driving to work. Good enough for me."
2,Lacking,"I have loved almost all Daheim's books, and reading them in no certain order, but this was one I couldn't wait to put down and not recommend. It seems no thought was given to the characters.....they have no real substance to them like in her other books. Judith herself seems like she has lost her gumption along with her wit and is just rambling through this story trying to out-do her hubby in guessing the murderer, even though she denies it. There is no heart in her sleuthing and even Renie seems less like Renie. Even Gertrude was down right annoying and I usually just find her annoyingly funny! Maybe Daheim's heart wasn't into this book when she was writing. It sure shows. If it weren't for Sweetums and Phyliss I would have put the book down."
3,The Bride Goes Over the Balcony,"Having read the other 11 books in this series, I was a little disappointed in this one. The book starts out well enough with the wedding of Judith Flynn's son Mike and his long-time girlfriend, Kristen. We have heard a lot about Mike in previous books in the series, but this is the first time he has actually appeared in one. While they are at the rehearsal dinner for Mike's wedding, Judith sees a man in a tux pushing a woman in a bridal gown over a balcony. When her policeman husband Joe is unable to find a body, Judith begins to doubt her sanity. Thereafter we are introduced to a parade of characters, who seem eccentric but somewhat disconnected. Judith, of course, continues her own investigation, trying to stay one step ahead of her husband. The plot is hard to follow and when the killer was revealed I almost didn't care any more. In her attempt to throw out red herrings, author Danheim just makes this book difficult to read."
4,"Great Book, but a bit confusing....","I am a complete FreeBSD newbie. I got this book hoping to be able to set up a FreeBSD server, and accomplished it with help from the book, but there were some differences and some confusing points in this book, but that's to be expected with revisions in FreeBSD itself. The only true complaint I have with this book is that it does not go into full descriptions on certain things; Example they begin talking about topic one, then branches off from there going into depth about topic two, then topic three, while your still wondering what topic one was still all about. That happened maybe twice in this book. Other than that, its a great beginners book."
2,FreeBSD Book Review,"I really haven't had a chance to get into this book because the FreeBSD CD, that was to be included in the book was not there. I have contacted Customer Service at Hippo Books as stated on the invoice, and as of yet they have not sent the CD, nor responded to my Email request to them. Considering that I only have half a product and cannot get any assistance from the shipping company I therfore rate this product with 2 STARS."
1,stay away from this book!,I simply found this book unreadable. It was extremely poorly written. Good luck on your attempt.
2,Not worth it to spend even a dollar!!,I rented this video to watch some good romantic and soft core scenes. The characters in this movie are not good at all. Acting is horrible. The video I rented was for 7 days and I didn't watch even the complete movie. Do not waste your money on this flick. Buy/Rent something else by paying a extra dollar.
2,Not bad but not perfect,"This guide is okay, but [really not too good]. It has alot of mistakes. In the level Cult Investigation (Tanaab), it was very confusing to follow."
5,A new Gone with the Wind,This is an epic story tracing a family over 9 generations. It is AMAZING. I could not put it down. The style of Shenkkan's writing and the ambition of the story reminded me of Gone with the Wind. Anyone involved or interested in the theatre must read this book!
1,WASTE OF MONEY,I purchased Kalo direct and used Kalo correctly and faithfully for two years. They said it 'takes time.' I saw absolutely no improvement. I do not recommend this product.
1,Not Happy with results,"After repeated usage for a month on a small chin area, I am disappointed to see that same hair is still growing back. It is still course. This product is not worth the $42.00 I paid for it. I am very disappointed."
5,this cd rocks,"this was a blind buy, but it turned out to be awesome. it was just too cool for the discman. i plugged this baby into my dads huge sterio that he couldnt' afford and wow, the tunes drifted my mind into the most creative place. the next night i started to write this screenplay about this hacker and stuff but it didn't turn out all that well. What an influence, BUY THIS. you wont regret it."
2,Didn't make much impact,"This book did not seem to help my son very much. He looked at it once and then never seemed interested in it again. He much prefers to look at ""Cars and Trucks and Things that Go"" and look for Goldbug when he is sitting on the Potty. Also the book is easily damaged. The pop-up tabs are a little small for little fingers."
2,Not that important,"This is not the "" must have"" book out there. I didn't get along any better with potty training with this book."
5,Great for both sexes,"My twins (boy and girl) love this book. The toddler pictured is pleasantly androgenous, which may bother some people, but not us. I think it's not good behavior for a boy to urinate standing up unless there's a urinal (too many ""aiming"" mistakes, even with grown men!), so having the character be sitting down is important. Charming and informational."
5,A must-read...,"...for Americans, who may be tempted to help the Russians fight against the Chechnyan terrorists. There are no good guys here, but a whole lot of evil happens. The story is told by an independant journalist who defies death to go where the Russian army doesn't want witnesses. The description of the fall of Grozny is a classic of war correspondence. Oh, and the stories about Sierra Leone and Bougainville aren't bad either."
2,Why was this not edited?,"I really wanted to like this book. The subject matter is extremely interesting, and Pelton did a fantastic job of getting interviews, tours, inside information, etc that make this book very important for understanding the referenced conflicts. His stories of personal contacts, and their everyday - and sometimes extraordinary - existence were elightening.Unfortunately, the book was poorly edited. Repeated sentences, mis-used words, ""they"" turned into ""the"" so often that it became expected...all of these mistakes took away significantly from the story and interrupted the flow of reading, sometimes as often as every two pages. Sometimes a story can escape its flaws and sometimes it cannot. Too bad that this is one time that the story could not stand on its own."
3,Better Live,"Well, I have to start out by saying that I've only heard With All Sincerity's cd once, but I have seen them live a couple of times when my band played with them. They are certainly a great band live, though it doesn't come out that well on this cd. Their singer was recently booted out of the band though, so that's a definate plus as he was the weak spot of the band. This cd isn't the greatest, but this band is on the rise and is sure to be great one the next cd if they can keep the core of their band together."
2,no,"No no no no no no no. Another trendy metalcore band trying to take riffs from Dillinger Escape Plan and Eyes Upon Separation, and play easier versions of them. They pull all the textbook crap that comes with metalcore today. Wannabe-technical lets throw in some wannabe-jazzyspazzy with bad breakdown crap. I'll give them effort for trying, but listen to EUS or Into The Moat instead."
5,Looking for something different & enjoyable? Here's the disk,"Although, I didn't purchase this disk from Amazon(sorry guys) I was in search of some others by this artist and new that you'd have it. I really love this disk because I hadn't heard anything like it before. Oh sure, done the Rave thing, done the Trance thing did/over did the Techno thing, but his is just different. Beautiful mixes of bizarre meodies and mantras. Unusual instruments and beats. I just really loved it."
3,Overrated.,"Some of the tracks presented here are genuinely awesome. However, the majority of the tracks are just a dense jungle of beats and tunes."
3,Overrated.,"Some of the tracks presented here are genuinely awesome. However, the majority of the tracks have are just a dense jungle of beats and tunes."
2,"cool at times, but nothing to write home about!","a lot of people love this CD, but i find it rather mediocore. if you're a stranger to indian music, you might find this indo-jungle hybrid pretty interesting, but i for one find nothing outstandingly appealing about it. now, this doesn't mean the cd is without strong points cuz it is. check out 'jaan.' it's a pretty groovy number with classical indian vocals. --from dr. sri chicago, usa"
2,TALVIN SINGH is a great artist but not on this album,"Talvin singh's album: OK is the one to buy, i thought i would purchase this one because i love him but luckily i only paid $3 for this, its not very good, i think there might b 1 possibly 2 songs that are cool out of 10 or 12, i forgot how many tracks are on there. But its a complete bore, check out the OK album on you tube, try ""Butterfly"""
3,dope,This CD is pretty cool even though I don't understand what the girl sings. Worth checking it out.
2,Bored Me,"I read all the reviews posted here prior to the purchase of this CD...I must say that I feel I was misled...this CD bored me to death, and now it sits in my CD rack collecting dust..."
2,not very happy,"I bought this CD thinking about the indian-electronic music, and i get disappointed when i heard it, it hasn't the indian essence like other CD's, it's more electronic than anything, and believe me that i'm a fan of talvin singh, karsh kale, cheb i sabbah and more...but anyway it has few cool songs, all are from talvin singh, one from state of bengal ""flight IC408"" and from Rahman (mumbai theme tune), it's like a bollywood score"
1,Horrible!!,"I bought this CD because so many good reviews about it were listed, but man!! what a terrible dissapointment. This CD is just plain awfull and I think I have an eclectic music taste. This is TRANCE music, only one track remained in my collection and that was ""Chitagong Chill"". The rest were trash.I should have known because I purchased ""Ha"" before, another Talving Singh CD and only one track was good on that one ""Mustard Fields"". You really have to be spaced out on acid to get into any of this stuff if you ask me. I made myself a note to NEVER purchase another Talvin Singh CD. I don't know how this got so many good reviews, so I had to cast my vote and try to balance the scales here."
4,$6 pad of paper?,"How do you review a pad of paper?If you work in a lab, you prob'ly paid $12 for this, so you could call this a discount. 12 cents/sheet is more than I pay for dollar bills.-----Pros: The layout is great for scrawling down tabulated data, and the pink lines are easy to write over when you need to annotate the data. 9 columns are almost enough, and the paper is hefty, won't tear under your mechanical pencil.Cons: 12 columns would be better. This pad is bound on the left, which makes it a smidge more annoying to write in the left margin. pictures don't always look right on the irregular tricolor gridlines. Pricey."
1,Unreadable bore,"I have a moderate interest in philosophy, and watched that recent show on PBS called Consolations of Philosophy, with some interest. Based on de Botton's interpretation of Seneca, I bought this book. I found it absolutely unreadable and boring. Furthermore, it does NOT contain De Irae/On Anger. I can't imagine anyone benefiting from reading this book, or enjoying it."
5,Vertex,"Queen's career was definitely a bell-curve; their earliest stuff is a bit cute and a mite artsy, and the last few years before Freddie's untimely demise they were running on fumes. But somewhere in the middle -- between say, Sheer Heart Attack and The Works -- they were as entertaining as anyone. On balance, ADATR is probably their best album. ANATO is brilliant, but is also overstuffed with losers like ""39,"" ""Good Company,"" and the tedious ""Sweet Lady."" ADATR has only the somnolent ""Drowse"" to break the momentum generated by energized efforts such as ""Tie Your Mother Down"" and ""White Man."" ""You Take My Breath Away"" is beautiful and intricate, and ""Good Old Fashioned Loverboy"" is a lavish hoot, but the crowning achievement is ""Somebody To Love."" How Freddie Mercury manages to rock so thoroughly in 12/8 rhythm is a complete mystery -- he mixes lightweight rock & roll, lightweight gospel, and his usual extravagant excess, and somehow comes out with a recording that inspires. What a voice!"
5,Just beautiful,"The music on this album is gorgeous, lush and above all, sincere. That's one of the great things about Queen: Their over-the-top brashness had an equally intense flip side of pure, unabashed feeling that, on ADATR, pours from every note. From rockers like ""Tie Your Mother Down"" to melancholy like ""Drowse"" to camp like ""Good Old Fashioned..."" to the ache of love in all its forms in the three great romantic numbers in the album: ""Somebody to Love"", that classic rock favorite, and two lesser-known and underrated numbers, ""You Take My Breath Away"" and ""Teo Toriatte"", and all the whimsy and pulse-pounding in between. The latter pair represent two reasons why it saddens me that so many Americans aren't well-versed in Queen's entire catalogue as opposed to their handful of big hits. Queen is more than arena/glam rock. Listen to this CD! Forget what you know about the band and let the music flow over you. And I promise, if you weren't a fan before, you will be forever."
3,VINYL,"Well, for starters, my LP arrived opened. In other words, not sealed. The record has no signs of wear or use, but still it was supposed to be new, as in sealed. At least that's what I supposed. Correct me if I'm wrong.It sounds as good as I expected it to be, so no complains there. I ordered 2 other LP's in the same order and each one was individually boxed within another big box. Great packaging!The music speaks for itself, so if you're interested just buy it! I would have rated it 5 stars if mine were to arrive sealed."
4,2nd. best Queen's album after A night at the Opera,"In a Queen collection, can't be left out A Night at the Opera and this great album. ""You take my breath away"" it really takes your breath. The ""Millionare Waltz"" is a great peace also, I would have not included the heavy passage in the song but, it gives another short dimesion to the song. Teo Torriate sounds like an Hyhme! The popular known ""Tie Your Mother Down"" reflects the heavy rock that Queen were used to in the first albums (Album which personaly I don't like). I think that ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""A Day at the Races"" should be a DoubleCD album. Because you can't have one without having the other. For me, were the best years of Queen."
5,Great Music,"If you like A Night At The opera, you should like A Day At The Races. The albums have the same artistic style and feel, Check out the songs ""The Millionare Waltz"" ""you Take My Breath Away"" along with the hits ""Tie your mother down"" and ""Somebody to love."""
5,Accept No Substitute!,"For those who don't know...This series of remasters was produced from the original studio tapes in Japan, with the agreement (co-operation) of the existing members of Queen.As opposed to other 'Remasters' I could mention (Hollywood, anyone?), these really deliver. I find it hard to believe that the band could have heard the same quality in the studio when they were recording the damned stuff.Pay the extra and buy them all from this series, the only I've still to get is Sheer Heart Attack, and I just can't wait!"
3,"i love queen, but this album does not compare with ANATO",This album lacks a lot of the creativity that A Night At The Opera had.
4,A Day at the Races ... indeed.,"Let's see, let's see ... A Night at the Opera, or A Day at the Races? Aside from their covers and titles, I'd say there isn't anything all to similar between the two. I prefer A Day at the Races. To me, the songs are better, and this album doesn't have a sense of arrogance that comes from A Night at the Opera. Tie Your Mother Down, Somebody to Love - 2 of Queen's very best. I prefer those songs over anything on Opera. But I'm not here to tell you about A Night at the Opera ... oh no. As an album, A Day at the Races does have it's weak points, but the songs, when taken out of context stand up as well as any other Queen song on their own. The aforementioned Tie Your Mother Down is probably the best song Brian May contributed to Queen's catalog. Apart from TYMD, Somebody to Love and Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy, the songs everybody is sure to know, there are some really great songs. Teo Torriatte, White Man, You Take My Breath Away. Go and buy this one, now!"
5,Magnificent Queen! A day at the races!,"Absolutely one of the best Queen albums/cd's. A lot of Hit songs here. Again very diversified styles ranging from heavy rock to the soft ballad (You Take My Breath Away)with Freddie Mercury in gorgeous voice,- such a beautiful song.! Everytime I listen to (Tie your Mother down) it makes me smile the lyrics are so much fun. The Bonus tracks of this song and( Somebody to Love) are really well done without messing too much with the original songs. Another favourite of mine is:( Teo Torriatte) obviously a big hit in Japan and a really pretty song. Plus( You and I) is a really lovely song that didn't get as much notice as it should have at the time. If you love Queen! Then this is a must have. Just great!"
4,Slightly excessive though commanding compositional talent throughout,"3 1/2A Day At The Races is largely overshadowed by what many consider Queen's masterpiece, the previously recored Night at the Opera. This follow-up might not have all the oomph that made that disc so memorable, but still manages to deftly combine two of Queen's driving forces, loud noisy rock mixed with their more unique Broadway musical style approach into another assured and memorable release."
4,purchased to make flash card sets,"If you are trying to learn something, it never hurts to have a set of flash cards in your purse, gym bag, or desk. Affixing flash cards to book rings enables them to be easily flipped and keeps them together. These rings are bigger than the pre-packaged index cards with rings that you might find at the store (Index Cards Ringdex,w/Removable,Poly Tab,3""x5"", (MEA63072) Category: Index Cards and Index Card Boxes). I did find that the rings opened a little more easily than I thought they would. For that reason, I placed two rings on every flash card set to ensure that my flash cards did not tumble to the ground and become jumbled. I will likely buy a smaller ring size for my next purchase. Still, this is a good product."
5,Multi-Use Book Rings,"I love Acco Metal Book Rings! This is probably a weird statement to make, but when you think outside of the box, they have many different uses:- Curtain rod hangers(recently tried this in a nursery and it adds a very modern touch to hanging curtains, plus they glide perfectly on the rod)- Study card holder(hole-punched the corner of index cards and had handy flashcards in minutes)- Picture holder(used this concept on a film set and had location shots, favorite camera angles, and crew contact information all together on one ring)- Book Rings(why not state the obvious, right?)Unlike binders, these rings do not tend to lose their ability to snap together. In other words, they don't bend out of shape easily.50 may seem like a lot, but you'll find uses for them eventually."
2,Metal rings,"I bought these for my students to use to clip their pencil bags to their desks. They don't close strong. They would probably be ok for very light purposes, but they are not sturdy enough for student use. I've also used them to hold flash cards, index cards, etc. that are used more infrequently and they did hold up better."
5,love them,"where a little bigger than i needed, however it did say 2 in in the description. Still love and can use them"
5,Great rings,"Rings were exactly as described, we use them for holding index cards together for school. Great for flashcards on the go. They were perfectly!"
5,Well written guide to Info Security,"This book focuses on what is, or should be, the most valuable part of any information system, the information. The book guides the reader from the very basics (the definition of information), explains cryptography, then recommends methods of securing the information system. The book is intended for college students but would benefit anyone who has an interest in learning more about information security and why it is important in the Internet age. The CD included with the book is very well done. It has many programming examples as well as interactive chapter tests and question sessions with the author."
5,Terrific Documentary,"I'm in complete agreement with the other reviewers, this is great and probably the best documentary on airships around. Well-produced and narrated. I have it on VHS and I'd buy it again on DVD IF they ever release it. A must for any LTA buff."
5,An eloquent presentation of Husserl's phenomenology,"Natanson's book is amazingly well-written. Husserl's often difficult and wordy ideas of phenomenology are covered clearly enough for the beginner, and in-depth enough for the student of Husserl. Natanson offers not just a review of phenomenology, but covers all from attitudes to methods, existence to the application of phenomenology. This is the first book I recommend to anyone studying Husserl."
1,Don't waste your money!,"It's large, cumbersome, underpowered and slow. Instead of the two double sided bits advertised I got one single sided bit. The articulation is nice but the whole thing is far to large to fit into smaller areas were that feature would be handy."
3,Decent for the Money,"I bought this screwdriver mainly because it was $4.99. I was expecting it to be smaller, which is also why I bought it. Not an ideal powered screwdriver for a tool belt. I do like how it is rechargeable and it's powerful enough for your typical around the house needs such as replacing batteries in kids toys, removing wall plates, and hanging pictures. All in all I like it but it is to bulky for what I originally intended it for."
1,The product I should not have bought,This product is terrible. It has no power. I would like to return it.
1,"Very, very, disappointed","I am very disappointed in this software. When I install it on my computer, it corrupts my Explorer files. In order to access the Internet, I have to uninstall Ad-Free and reinstall Explorer. Therefore, this software is worthless! I can not get a hold of the company for help. I have sent emails through the website and get no response. Their phone number is an endless cycle of voice mail commands. Since the software is opened, I can't return it for a refund. ..."
5,PINK POTS,Pots are great. The non stick layer pretty much makes it impossible to burn anything.Easy to clean too.One more middle size sausepan should be part of it to make absolutely perfect!!!
1,Steppin' Out by Carrie Weiland,"I have been exercising to step videos for more than 10 years. This is by far the worst video I have ever used. The routines are extremely boring and the music is horrible. Furthermore, there is no ambiance -- the video set is dull. Exercising to this tape was so painful, I could not finish it. I will give this tape away. This tape can not compare to my Reebok Step Videos by Gin Miller. I have every one (that I know about). Gin Miller arranges energetic step routines with lots of non-stop movement. Besides that, her team is fit and ready, the music is great, and the video sets look like exercise studios! I give Carrie Weiland's Steppin' Out video 1 star for wasted effort."
3,Review,I was a little disappointed with this book. It's thick and I was expecting more of a history of each custom listed. Instead there are multiple entries all saying basically the same thing. Not one I'd recommend for finding out anything useful about Scottish customs.
2,Too much doesn't go far.,"The book DID provide a lot of insightful information. Margaret Bennet certainly used her resources well, however, I felt there was just too much information in a single book. The anecdotes were educational and humorous. The general structure of the pages gave the appearance of repetition and the paragraphs tended to make the reader start looking for a break. While I applaude Mrs. Bennett for her presentation of the customs I sought, I was disappointed in it. Based upon my experience, I could not recommend the book."
4,Scottish Customs,"Takes you by the hand and walks you through day-to-day customs: courting, birth, baptism, relationships, marriage, death. It is weak on the custom of ""bundling"", but otherwise does an excellent, thorough job. The concept of a future bride carrying a chamber pot from house to house where she jumps over the pot several times in front of each door (filled with salt) and people insert coins into the salt is a delight. The author is careful to point out current and historic, urban and rural practices. This is robust. Photographs are unneeded, the author paints a thorough picture."
2,pearls fell off,"Beautiful watch, but the pearls fell off soon after I started wearing it. Don't waste your money..."
5,gila window tint limo efffect,used this on my house; i live in phoenix az; this helps a lot in reducing solar heat gain coefficient; good for your car or hour home; don't believe that nonsense about the film messing with the window seal; it works fine on double pane windows &will not adversely affect their R value
1,Bad quality,Dont buy this product if u dont wanna lose your money..Bad quality..Bad material..I'll never gonna try this brand again.. too disappoint with this product.
3,YOU CAN GET THIS ONE ON ANY AUTOZONE.,I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU TO GET IT AT AUTOZONE. THERE YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT SHADES AVAILABLE. IF YOU HAVE ANY TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE THAN YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS ONE IS LEGAL FOR THE BACK WINDOWS. DON'T USE IT ON THE FRONT ONES UNLESS YOU WANNA GET PULLED OVER BY A COP. GOOD LUCK!
3,For flat windows only,"I tried installing this on a very slightly curved rear window- it would not lay flat even when heated with a heat gun, which is possible to do with some films. Seemed OK otherwise, though I pulled it off before it was completely set up.Otherwise probably a DIY person can do with some patience. I'm popping to have mine professionally done.UPDATE- had a pro install done using Johnson films- they were able to shape the film exactly. Cost me $120- I would have have to have purchased 2 rolls of this film to fit my windows, at a cost of 30, so basically it cost me $90 for a pro install."
3,probably a great product,"I was a complete failure with the installation, this may have been my fault, or partially the cheep tools sent with the kit. It would have been a lot cheaper at my local big box auto parts store."
3,Not Ms. D's Finest Hour,"I truly love Dinah Washington and her music, but this album is not the best showcase of her sound and ability. The arrangments are more suited for the Lawerence Welk set than a vocalist such as Dinah. Some of the songs are enjoyabale, and Dinah's vocal prowess is evident in every track, but the overall feeling is thin and dry. One would do much better to pick up an album such as ""For Those in Love"" or ""Swining with Ms. D"". Those albums are Dinah Washington as her finest."
3,stereo mix is not great,"Dinah's voice comes out of my left speaker only, the right speaker has only instrumental...not crazy about this audio mix. The album is wonderful though...her phrasing is incredible."
5,Dinah Washington Was Unique,"I was only vaguely aware of Dinah Washington when I first heard her rendition of ""What a Diff'rence a Day Made"" about 15 or 20 years ago. With that song she reached out and took ahold of my body and soul. Listening to Washington is a truly transporting, rapturous experience, something (although I love and respect Sarah Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald) I have only ever felt for one other performer - Lady Day herself. This album is as good a Dinah Washington primer as you are likely to find. Buy and enjoy!"
1,Don't read it!,"This book is so stupid! It keeps changing from one subject to another. NONE of the book makes sence. Probley because its told from a russian point of view. The book is set at the end of world war II, which is when all the russians stared to live in the german people's home. All the girl does in the book is wine about the russians. Do not read this book!"
2,World War I US Navy Propaganda,"This book is fundamentally a collection of a series of articles written for a large-circulation magazine during the war as propaganda. It is full of errors (many of them, I suspect, quite deliberate), heavily-censored, and of little use to anyone except as a reminder of how the American media _used_ to cover wars.The Kindle edition is also very badly formatted and full of transcription/scanning/whatever errors, many of which would've been caught had the publisher made even the slightest attempt at quality-control. As an example, the _title_ of my copy, as listed on my Kindle's home page, reads ""The U & # 45 ; boat Hunters"". There is no excuse whatsoever for such a gross formatting error, involving of all things the _title_, to reach the customer."
4,"This is unique, interesting and well documented book","I read with great interest Haggai's latest book: ""Ras Alula and the Scramble for Africa: A Political Biography: Ethiopia & Eritrea 1875-1897""As most people agree this is unique, interesting and well documented book. Only I wish, for historical reason, the title was different. For instance Abyssinia rather than ""Eritrea & Ethiopia"" because these names were given by colonial powers that divided and ruled the country with disastrous consequence that we all know.He should be applauded for his effort and great interest in Abyssinian unique history.Deborah JessieParis, France"
3,Unfortunately cut,"While this is an enjoyable video, some of the key scenes are missing. Too bad, since the result is far less satisfying."
4,dang,very good . some nude bellydancing that laura gemser is doing with another woman I might buy it again for ive seen the movie
5,perfection,"Ranglin first gained the world's attention in the 60s when he played a major role in developing Ska, and in this album his music still sounds fresh and exciting. The back-up group consists of acoustic bass, drums, percussion and famous Jamaican pianist Monty Alexander. My personal favourite tracks have to be 'Surfin', 'Below the Bassline' and the Reggae classic 'Ball of Fire' with outstanding sax solos by the mighty Ronald Alphonso. A stunning blend of Ska, Reggae & Jazz, Definetly worth checking out."
5,"Cool watch, Chick Magnet","I'm very glad I chose this watch. It's so cool!I don't mind the weight cuz I do weights in the gym so I'm used to it. :)For those who want this adjusted, go to a watch service center; though I was able to do it myself cuz I saw how it was done. Carefully use a pin to push-down the rods binding a chain (ones marked with an arrow at the back). That's how to detach a chain. Then reconnect the watch, and reinsert the rod, and push it into place. NOTE: Be sure you don't damage the watch & its parts and you don't hurt yourself. Pushing the rods will require precision force.It's a break from all watches from the past with dull colors. I'll still use my previous watch for rugged times, and reduce chances for this watch to get scratched (I tend to scratch my watch in narrow places). For the office, travel or parties, I'll definitely wear this."
5,Great Commentary,If you're not familiar with Kenneth Wuest he has a very practical approach to Scripture. He is careful and clear in his analysis of the Word and explains it in a clear and understandable way. Using his work on Romans was a great help.
5,my rabbit loves it,"I am not an advocate of keeping rabbits unless you have a large pen fit for rabbits, you have researched their care, and you are prepared to devote lots of love, time, and plenty of attention to them. Our rabbit is a large white guy that really was too big for the box, but loved sitting on top. Then he turned it over and we discovered that he just loves sitting inside it! I am buying another one today for our other rabbit. Our rabbits are both adopted as they were no longer wanted by their owners. If you are interested in rabbits, consider adoption, but read up thoroughly on their needs first."
1,Disappointing,I received this after asking for it for 3 years so imagine my surprise when I recieved this cheap necklace. 1st the medallion is extremely thin and no where near the quality I thought it would be. It feels and looks cheap. You would think after spending 100 dollars the quality would at a minimum match that of James Avery but you can not even compare the two. I could bend the medallion with my fingers that is how thin it is possibly about as thick as one milimeter or so. 2nd the chain that the came with it looks like it should be made for a child instead of an adult. It looks cheap and is far to small to go with the medallion and i'm not talking about the length of the necklace but i'm talking about the links of the chain. If you have seen baby necklaces and how small the links are this chain is 18' of that. After wanting this necklace for so long I feel as though we were cheated by this cheap imitation.
5,This book makes you reflect on what is really important,"If you are in search of meaning, Why Struggle? : Life Is Too Short to Wear Tight Shoes is an excellent insight into why some things simply do not mean as much as the power given them. It was a refreshing look at life's perspectives. Great Book and a must read !"
1,What Edge of Paper Fasten to?,"is this the prong fastener that goes on the 11in side (portrait), rather than the 8.5in side (landscape) of the paper?i give it no rating, as i've not bought any."
4,For Hardcore Blues Fans Only,"I have the record for ""If You Love these..."" so my comments are related only to that parts of the CD from that record.Anyway, I rate this very highly but for hardcore blues fans only. Bloomfield does a great job re-creating the feel/style for each song using the style of the original artist/time period. My favorites are Mama Lion, WDIA, and Hey Foreman.This is not your Bloomfield guitar slinger album, rather a serious study in the diverse styles of the blues. He shows why he was so great."
5,"In a way, the best of Bloomfield.","Mike Bloomfield's trademark style was a foundation of BB King riffs with jazzy noodleing and raga-like easternisms in the spaces where King would simply not have played at all. When MB first hit the scene, this style shook every young guitarist up; it was no longer ok to just learn the tunes, you had to learn how to -play-. His ahead-of-the-barlines phrasing, and melodic fearlessness conveyed a sense of constant exploration. As time has passed, the original blues artists' simplicity has come to be appreciated by a mass audience, and Mike's busy style has become less in vogue. On that basis, this may be the best place to start your Bloomfield collection: because he is referencing the styles that influenced him, more than performing, the performance itself is more rooted and bluesy than much of his other work."
4,GREAT ARTIST AND ALBUM,"ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED MUSICIANS OF ALL TIME--A GREAT LOSS TO THE MUSIC WORLD...-FROM SOULFUL, SEARING ELECTRIC BLUES GITAR, TO COUNTRY, BLUES AND RAGTIME ACOUSTIC GITAR, MIKE BLOOMFIELD DOES IT ALL---AND FINE VOCALS, TOO!--HE EVEN GIVES PLAYING TIPS ON THIS ALBUM TO PASS ON HIS KNOWLEDGE TO OTHERS--"
4,The Anthology Needs An Apology,"Although Island had good intentions on creating an anthology album for the remembrance of their 3 albums Handsworth Revolution, Tribute To The Martyrs, and Reggae Fever (Caught You). Some how I believe this was just a poor excuse for them not to release the remastered editions. All some original track were replaced by the 12"" extended versions and it also contains bonus tracks like Nyah Love and Bun Dem (Handsworth Revolution), Macka Splaff (Live) (Tribute To The Martyrs), & Don't Give In (Reggae Fever (Caught You)). I give it a B+, but not because of the album. It would of got an A but Island Records refuse to release remastered versions of their fist 3 albums and decided to use this instead, which is a major kick in the crotch. In my defense I'd rather buy all 3 to show off in my collection, they could of at least kept the original and extended versions. They deserve to have remastered versions so why not go ahead and do it already?!?!?-DJ"
3,What's up with the sound ?,"There's no doubt that this CD contains the band's finest material which deserves 5 stars. Much better then the post-Island Disco-ized reggae they played later. The problem is the recording. I have an old video tape of Steel Pulse at Reggae Sunsplash (tribute to Bob Marley, '82 maybe, this is a must have) with Black Uhuru. I play it on a mono VCR and it sounds way better than this CD hooked up to the same SOUND SYSTEM. This CD just does'nt have any OOmph to it. I mean the low end just ain't there. I have Hansworth Revolution on tape recorded from the LP and it sounds way better than this recording. Maybe it could be improved with an equalizer. Great material. Bad recording."
5,my son loves it,"These gel sheets do exactly what it says on the box -- ""relief from fever discomfort"". Not to say that it would bring the fever down much; I recommend using drugs for that, but my son had a headache due to fever and I could not give him yet another dose of Advil, because of the time-frame, so I used these and they worked. He felt much better within minutes and the next day he asked for it himself."
2,Rotten!,"In my oponion,this film is darn stupid.The effects are bad,the directing is okay and the acting decent.The main reason this film wasn't a one star is just because of Daniel Craigs acting.Overall,bad."
1,Didn't really like this movie,I didn't really like this movie. In fact it put me to sleep 3/4 of the way through. I'm assuming it didn't get any better during the final 1/3
2,Wasted $1.50,"Rented it from a Red-Box. Paid way too much, when we saw the trailer in the theater our response was ""Red Box"" This wasn't even worthy of a Red-Box rental. They story was very weak, the effects marginal, and the ending all too predictable. Don't waste your time."
2,Pointless Plot,"I wanted to see this movie only because Harrison Ford was in it. It was slow, long and boring at times. Overly bloody, body parts flying everywhere, horse's heads getting ripped off.. It was quite gorey. It was a novel concept gone typical, ""Aliens killing humans and destroying everything..because they can"".I was expecting a better story, more info on the aliens, like who, what, when and where? But it's always good to see Harrison Ford...one of my favs. I think they relied too much on CGI and should have paid for better writers."
5,Excellent Movie!,"Daniel Craig (007 movie) does an incredible performance in this exciting movie. If you like sci-fi and action movies, this is a must to have in your collection. I keep watching it over and over and it still is exciting every time. Harrison Ford was a great surprise too. I really love this movie."
2,too silly,"I was a huge fan of HF and a recent fan of DC, but this was too silly for me. And, I am pretty good about watching movies like this just for fun. This was far too predictable and there just was NO depth to the characters. I have not been impressed by Craig's skill with accents- his American accent in this was almost as dreadful as his Polish accent in Defiance *shudder.*"
3,Not bad,"Bought this for someone last year for Christmas. I don't think he ever watched it or even know it's his. I didn't think the movie was bad, but Spielberg has been stinkin up the place in Hollywood lately...what happened Steve?"
2,Potential,Lots of shiny computer graphics with notable actors giving little life to a terrible script with a story of cowboys and Aliens.
4,Good .,"It's one of the movies that if it was on tv , you would watch it . Its good to own but it's not fantastic . The acting is great and the special effects are good also ."
2,Took a good concept and spoiled it,"I watched this movie with an open mind, but my mind could only open so far. I do not want to give too much away, but the movie seemed to be building nicely until a ridiculous plot twist involving Olivia Wilde. It is sci-fi so I am willing to suspend belief up to a certain point if a script is written well; but after the aforementioned plot twist, the movie started to unravel and go down hill in a rapid, gravity-fueled inferno. My enjoyment turned to disappointment. It became so cliche and anti-climatic, even Indiana Jones and James Bond could not save it. Not a movie I would want to watch again."
5,Fun with Craig and Ford and the Aliens,"To begin with, everyone should remember that Harrison Ford movies are about having fun, and this movie about cowboys and aliens is no exception. Cowboys and Aliens, Indeed. What's not fun abouteven the title of this film? The action and special effects are really great! As in most of Harrison Ford films, there is room for everything: romance, high drama, fighting aliens, spacecraft, Indians,explosions and more. And the entire story should be enjoyed as a fun experience, which it is! I think that I enjoyed the hummingbird the most. How could I not recommend this wonderfuladventure for everyone? See it and have fun."
1,...ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I usually only contribute a review when I have some thing positive to say, but not this time. Wow...where to begin?! With all of the talent associated with this movie (both behind and in front of the camera) I naturally expected a thoroughly enjoyable and watchable film. I wasn't looking for a masterpiece...just a solid entertaining couple of hours. But I guess even the best of Hollywood can produce a dud every once in a while and that, unfortunately, is definitely the case here. It sure starts out with an intriguing premise...cowboys and aliens, for crying out loud! I mean, how can you beat that...right? However, about the only thing I can say I remotely enjoyed was the musical score. I won't try to describe the plot...there are already many fine reviews that have done that. Just want to add my advice to the prospective viewer and DVD buyer...walk away from this turkey...VERY far away."
2,Cowboys & Aliens,"Bad script,unintersting characters,long and boring.Not even all the big actors in this movie can save it from this mess.The only thing that was good about this movie was that they made the aliens look cool and you don't even see the first alien until about 50 minutes into the movie.Good thing I din't pay anything to see this movie but it's 2 hours of my life I can't get back.Not worth your time or money."
3,It's an OK movie,I have to admit it was strange seeing Indiana Jones and James Bond both playing cowboys. All joking aside these two guys are great actors and worked well together. The setting for the film is gritty and realistic as are the costumes and sets. As weird as the concept may sound at first... you know; Cowboys and Aliens? The plot is almost believable in the way it's presented. I don't want to reveal too much but these are really bad ass aliens and I cheered [inside] every time one of them got blown away. I gave the film 3 stars because it's a simple movie with good acting and production value but there are more than a few holes in the story. It's almost like scenes were edited out without concern for continuity. Even with those flaws I liked this film; it will make a nice addition to my collection
3,Entertaining with good but not great special effects,"Starts out with great suspense and Sci-Fi mystery, fizzles out in the second half. Strong cast attracted me to this movie, but not much of a story. Special effects looked good on SD on PC not great. Wish HD streaming to PC would be available ..."
4,Pretty good movie,"We don't usually splurge and see movies in the theater, nor do we usually pay for a movie to ""stream,"" as we usually watch the freebies. Sometimes we break out of cheap mode and pay for a movie to stream through Amazon. We were pretty happy with this movie, which had a good cast. If you're looking for something a little different, I would say this is a good movie to watch."
1,High Hopes,"I had really high hopes for this movie. It has a unique theme that sounded like it would be an interesting movie to watch. Somehow they managed to ruin it with poor acting and annoying characters. Seriously, the only believeable acting was from Harrison Ford's characters son. He played a spoiled brat very well."
2,Crap movie that had potential,"It could have been great but it was not. The cast was great. The concept could have been great but it took most of the movie for the cowboys to get to and attack the aliens and the aliens themselves were a letdown. I hear the graphic novel was better, if no less cheesy."
2,Would be better if it weren't for the sick torture,"I was left with a sick feeling after watching this movie. I thought a film with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig would be some good eye candy but thank goodness I didn't eat anything before watching. There is once scene in particular that is really awful. Even though the torture was shroud in darkness, you knew exactly what was happening and I just want to throw up. I'm NOT a fan of any sort of sicko horror movies and I feel rather dismayed and mislead to the nature of the film. I don't really mind gun fights and bloodshed but I draw the line at vivisection and disembowelment. WTF.One star for Daniel Craig and one star for Harrison Ford, Minus a million stars for not warning me about the torture!"
2,Sad? Glad?,"Or just plain BAD?First half of movie was OK.That portion was mostly white hat/black hat,punch 'em in the nose stuff, kick 'em in the groin stuff.But then the unbelievable nonsense started. Come on,jumping on a flying saucer? That may be a taskfor Spider Man; but a bowlegged cowboy?Harrison Ford must be hurting for work to accept such apart. I wonder if he is embarrassed to have his nameassociated with such dribble.If you are in the mood for brain-freeze, then thismight be right up your alley, uh, canyon."
2,Not so much,"I watched this for the actors. Never have been a great western fan nor sci-fi guy but always like a good adventure/action flick. I don't think it woulld matter who did the acting,I couldn't get into the movie. Too much cheese and a bit slow.Why do Hollywood aliens typically have two legs, two arms, two eyes, two ears, and a nose?"
4,Blu-ray Review C & A,The movie basically had a dumb premise but contained a lot of action and was entertaining. Kind-of a Sci-Fi comedy...
4,Pretty good,I enjoyed this film although I had hoped it would be much better. The concept is original and I'm surprised it hasn't been done before (that I know of). All of the cast are very good and the special effects are excellent too. Overall it's a good film but it probably could have been a lot more fun with a slightly better plot.
4,Way better than I was expecting,The pre-views did this movie no justice.... It was really GOOD!!! As a matter of a fact I watched it twice. The film is filled with great actors. This movie is totally worth your time. Enjoy!!!
4,A decent film for movie night,"This is by no mean a horrible movie. I give it 4 stars for the effort and the acting is always magnifiscent from harrison ford suprisingly. At first I was like ""oh no, not another alien movie."" But they did put a twist on it not just with the cowboys, but also with smaller stories within the movie. I am being generous in giving the 4 stars because this film didn't leave me with any ""wow "" moments or saying i can't wait to buy this movie on dvd, or anything. I want to say it left a bad taste in my mouth because the whole alien and amnesia thing has been played to death and now they are just putting cowboys in there, but overall it's a decent film and you'll get your money's worht. No complaints here from this movie out of me. It just wasn't one of this year's best films for me but an entertaining 2 years. And i like their effort on the plot. They also did not overdo it on the special effects. Thanks guys. Merry Christmas. Godbless. Praise Jesus.~Shauns movie review"
4,"lol, Cowboys and Aliens.","I think that if you *want* to watch a movie called ""Cowboys and Aliens"", and immediately think when you hear the title, 'that sounds like fun', then you won't be disappointed. It's just a fun, well-crafted movie. Miles above something like Laserblast [which I thought was conceptually awesome when I was a kid]. Sure, there were some things that didn't quite makes sense, and there were some definite lost opportunities [IMO everyone at the end should have ended up with ""arm blasters"", especially Emmet]. Still, it was fun to watch and genuinely engrossing for me. I'm a huge nerd - and fan of Favreau's work, so there you go.Just the fact that you have Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford shooting aliens makes it worth a viewing."
4,"Aww, give the movie a break - it's a lot of fun!","My guiltiest guilty pleasure of the year, so far - can't help it, but had a LOT of fun with this genre-mix of old-time western meets sci-fi alien infestation flick. Daniel Craig takes himself a bit too seriously here, Harrison Ford getting it exactly right, and this is definitely a film where you have to check your brain at the door AND be willing to suspend your logic for awhile. The VERY talented supporting cast, especially, are terrific here at supporting the bigger names; without them, even with Craig and Ford starring, I don't think I would have enjoyed this as much as all. NOTE: See the extended version (2:15 minutes) over the theatrical release (1:59 minutes), if possible!"
5,Very interesting Western/sci-fi hybrid,"Daniel Craig plays Jake Lonergan, a man who one day awakens in the middle of the desert with a bizarre contraption attached to his left arm. After a nasty encounter with some locals (from which he emerges victorious)he wanders into Absolution, a small Western town overseen by Dollarhyde, a war hero turned wealthy land baron played by Action icon Harrison Ford. Jake remembers nothing of his past prior to being in the desert yet one night when mysterious flying alien ships come swooping from the sky and begins abducting various townspeople, Jake and Dollarhyde must join forces, along with others, to battle the extraterrestials and rescue the townsfolk. Good SFX and attention to scenic detail make it a fun ride."
3,About like you'd expect from the previews,"...if you don't get your hopes up. It's a serviceable distraction. Daniel Craig is stiff, Olivia Wilde is hot and Harrison Ford is iconic in a cliché kinda way. If you're into popcorn you'll wreck a bag or bowl or whatever but you won't be left exactly stressed out.If it isn't obvious, I did get my hopes up because I did the math and the sum of the parts is much more than what this is. On the other hand, if you take this review to heart you'll probably enjoy it more than I did."
2,Cowboys & Aliens,Was just OK.. I've seen better. Seen one you have seen them all.. Just made it in to cowboys and???.. Amazon did a fast job shipping..
3,not really worth watching,"it's ok with names on it should have been a good movie but it just seems weak with subpar acting bad dialogue script and bad direction, Aliens arent thrilling scary or interesting just brutes that die by ""hot shots"" like shooting 1000 times"
3,Expected better,"Having seen the trailers I was expecting more than I received when I watched it.With the stars and budget it should have been a better filmPerhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I had watched it for free.Its not without its entertaining moments, there is just not enough of them.Harrison Ford looks bored every time he is on screen.My advice is to wait for it to appear on your TV screens and watch it for free."
3,Interesting re-working of time-worn plot elements,"This movie is entertaining because it takes the very familiar alien invasion genre and places it in the surprising setting of the old west. But otherwise the story is not very original. If you imagine the very same story set in contemporary times, you would be thinking, ""I think I've see this movie before."""
3,Odd little mash-up is enjoyably forgettable.,"Will you remember this film 5 years from now? Yes, as it is an odd mash-up of a western and sci-fi movie. It's not convoluted in plot and its characters are pretty conventional. It's pacing is a bit slow and doesn't sustain the tension very well but the inhumanly blue hues of stars Daniel Craig's and Olivia Wilde's eyes will stay with you for awhile. Harrison Ford's grizzled cowboy isn't convincing but he lends a touch of humanity to the proceedings, as does Yancy Butler's preacherman. The special effects are adequate but underwhelming (this is a special effects movie after all but you don't leave the film and think to yourself afterward, ""Wow, that was fantastic! How did they do that?"") and the aliens are a mish-mash of many other previous alien scourges. They were meh. If you never get around to this one you won't have missed much."
4,Interesting Storyline,Ok. I did like the movie more so for the action sequences than anything else. I never thought Harrison Ford would play a part in a movie like this. I did enjoy it though.
3,Not your typical Cowboy movie!,"Different roll for Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig ... but slow and confusing at first, but a nice movie. Probably not something I'd choose to watch a 2nd time anytime soon."
4,Fun popcorn movie.,"This is a fun movie to watch when your brain needs some downtime. Good actors and visuals with lots of action. It uses the standard Western motif (a mysterious stranger appears in a dusty run-down town) with a twist. Guess it won't be a spoiler by saying that it has some vicious aliens with buggy flying machines. After I watched the download version, I bought the Blu-ray. Good fun!"
4,Cowboys and Aliens,For what is essentially a 'B' movie..I thought it was pretty good. The actors carried the day more than the story. Delivery was timely and the disc was in great condition
3,it's ok,this movie and my opioning was just ok...they could of my it so much better but then again its not the hangover part 2...
2,Pretty weak film,"I have always liked a good western. I have always liked a good alien movie. When I first saw this movie was coming out, I thought there could be no better premise for a film.But even though it had an all star production team and a strong cast, I think this film fell flat with all it tried to do.I am not going to go into what the film was supposed to do, but I think it failed as a western film, it failed as an alien film and probably was one of the biggest disappointments of the year.I rarely, if ever recommend NOT to purchase an item. But you may wanna wait until it comes out on TV."
1,Terrible blu-ray,"This is not a review of the movie itself, but a review of the blu-ray. I would give it zero stars if I could. This did not work AT ALL on my blu-ray player. The movie would not play at all, it just kept jumping to the Extras screen. To add insult, the Extras wouldn't play either--just an endless loop of waiting for menus to load and never being able to see any video. A frustrating half hour of reloading and re-trying before I finally gave up on it. Do not buy this buggy disc. If you like the idea of sci-fi mixing with western, try the Firefly blu-ray instead."
4,Better than Expected,"This was a fun movie to watch, and the leads did a very good job. The premise of aliens landing in the Old West is not as preposterous as it may sounds. Why would they just have visited during the 20th Century? Prepare for a fun time with plenty of action scenes and bit of coincidence and luck. Overall a good ride..."
3,Average,"This movie cost almost 170 million dollars to make which honestly does not play as a 170 million dollar movie. It does not matter what movie it is, if I have to hit the fast forward button due to extended long boring scenes then it was not money well spent. My 3$ I paid was not the loss, the 170 million dollars was the loss.Any how the lead acting and some of the alien scenes was what compelled me to watch on, other than that it's just average.Watch on a rainy day."
4,Unanswered Scenes,"Independence Day meets Indiana Jones? This movie was better than I had expected.There was 3 things that were unclear 1:What was the aliens using the gold for 2:Why were they capturing the people for and 3:Why did the girl not come back after being killed the 2nd time, after all she did come back when she had got killed the first time.I give 4 stars"
1,Awful,"I expected this to be bad, but it was terrible. The cheesy premise would have been acceptable had it not been for a lack of plot. Awful story telling. Miserable acting. There's no end to the things that were wrong with this."
1,A Stinker!!!,"Should have known better but concept, ""Cowboys and Aliens"" interested. Have nothing good to say about this film. Script needed a severe edit/rewrite, very uneven pacing, Ford is just awlful, special effects nothing to write home about. So I suggest you forget this one and do not rent."
3,a lot of action,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
4,Good Movie,"Okay sci fi, but not great... Some high powered actors, but the movie lacked power punch, but worth watching for the fun of it."
5,Forget the Ttitle: a Fun Movie!,"Good movie! Really, really bad title!!! I'm aware that this movie is based upon a graphic novel of the same name, but that's no excuse for keeping the title! The title discouraged me from seeing this in the theatres and my son had no interest in this movie for the same reason. But both of us loved it! So whichever of the many producers chose to keep this title should be fired! Better titles:""The Strange Events at Saddle Rock"", (I'm making up the town name here.) ""Demons at Black Rock"", ""Really Bad Day at Black Creek"" -- almost any other title would've been better! Heck, even ""Snakes on the Plains"" might've been better. All I'm saying is: Don't be discouraged by the title. Daniel Craig is a convincing cowboy for a limey and the movie is light-hearted escapism. This is now on my Amazon wishlist."
3,UNEVENTFUL,I like the actors- Harrison and specially Daniel Craig. The premise of the story was empty for me. There was no fullfillment. I like alien movies but this didn't make sense. I will pass on this. Embarassed to mention to friends.
3,ok,this movie is enjoyable but noy one you will want to see over and over again lots of people skipped it and missed out
5,Reminded me of The Time Tunnel!!!!!,"This movie took me back to a childhood television favorite, ""The Time Tunnel"" where you might be taken to the past or the future, and as in one case, back to the wild west and cavalry and indian battles where aliens from the future were also involved. The sort iof television guaranteed to fire ones imagination. Cowboys and Aliens had a great cast, some of whom who I would not normally associate with a western, yet who were all stellar. The special effects were never predictable or tiring, but enhanced the story greatly! I loved this one!"
2,"Wow, this movie is terrible","Talky and slow without being interesting, funny, insightful or anything other than conventional and completely unsurprising. Ironic for a western/space alien mashup movie. Why is it sooooo boooring? Jon Favreau I'm so disappointed in you. I'm only giving it 2 stars rather than 1 because the actors are good."
4,Sci-Fi Meets Western,"I admit I only went to this movie because my wife really wanted to see it. We went with our 20 year old son and we all three enjoyed the film. If you love Western movies and you love Sci-Fi movies, then I am sure you will be as thrilled as my wife to watch or own this movie. It was worth it to see how excited she was about it, ahead of time as well as afterward."
1,People Actually Pay Money For This Crap?,"Great cast but horrible film, the plot was ridiculous. I can't believe Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig agreed to be in this POS."
1,"ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES, I HAVE EVER SEEN","I dont understand Spielberg, he is such a gifted movie maker. This movie was trash.............I dont believe this movie will do well, in blu ray sales, as the motion picture, was extreemly boring, and stupid. as well as to far fetched............did I menchion the popcorn was good though......."
1,One of the worse movies ever,"The movie was terrible-very, very bad. Besides having two high quality actors (Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig) the plot was almost too simple for the average viewer and very corny. I understand mixing the two genres of western movies and sci-fi flicks probably hasn't been done before but this wasn't the best way to go about doing it. The aliens and their ships did seem pretty cool but theres very well done CGI in many other sci-fi movies plus they didn't show the aliens that clearly. Olivia Wilde has been good in other movies but looked totally out of place and did a poor job of acting in this movie. Overall though the plot, certain scenes in the movie, and poorly done scenery with CGI and the actors made it look to be a level right above ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" (A B-rated movie). Way too overrated of a movie to say the least. Shame on Hollywood for producing this one."
2,Enjoyed the movie but can't stand the lockups,"I liked this movie, but am giving it only 2 stars because the Amazon Video on Demand once again locked up at an inappropriate time. Of course I had company over that night. I had to stop the movie, leave Amazon Video on Demand, then come back to it and restart the movie. They really need to get faster servers! My broadband is rock solid and I have a download speed of 12.5Mbps..."
2,Disappointing flick,I thought it was dumb. You might want to rent it on Netflix but don't expect much from this less than average attempt at a sci-fi movie.
2,Everyone should have been zapped!,"The Good - Daniel Craig makes a heck of a macho cowboy.The Bad - everything else about this movie - pathetic storyline, tired special effects.Feel sorry for Harrison Ford who really looks old and worn out in this movie (in a terribly cliche'ed role). Time for him to pick grandpa roles!"
2,Bad picture quality,While watching this movie my computer showed a full connection but the picture quality was terrible. I am just about over trying to use Amazon instant video. Most of the time i will show a full connection with my modem but the amazon videos will say i have a poor connection. It is very frustrating.
1,Very disappointing,"Sorry to say, this movie was a disappointment. Harrison Ford was not at his best, I expected better. He did not make a convincing cowboy. The Indians seemed to be rather lame in the movie. The characters were not well developed at the beginning of the story. A boring movie, the plot was not well done. The only decent part of the movie were the special effects, especially when some of the actors did their own stunts."
5,COWBOY & ALIEINS,"EXELLENT MOVIE,ITS THE TYPE OF MOVIE I'LL WATCH SEVERAL TIMES & NOT GET BORED WITH IT. WISH IT WAS IN 3D"
3,MMMMMMmmmmmmm?,"Not sure exactly what to say other than, it was entertaining and that is what movies a made for??? Oh yes, and money too! Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are (of course) Excellent in their respective roles. The movie itself kind of lets you go to many times, atleast 3. So after the first (dis-charge) you are kind of lost in movie-land outer-space. It is a solid 3 stars, but beware they lose touch with the viewer far to many times to get a (real) grip of the story-line. It is worth the 3 Bucks to rent, but to Buy??? ""I think not"""
3,Cowboys and aliens,Odd plot but seasoned actors make it work. Harrison Ford is looking pretty worn. Probably time for him to hang up his boots in action films.
3,It's alright.,I feel that one of the only reasons I bought this movie is because H. Ford is in it. Not to much drama. Not scarry. Not much gun fighting. It wasn't as action packed as I had hoped.
2,Thoroughly embarassing- RESIST THE URGE,"Two great stars in/past their prime, how do they or their agents/advisors let this happen? Couldn't they break Craigs ankle or double check the insurance and hire a torch? You will be amazed at how absurdly ridiculous the characters and the dialogue are. I mean there must have been competition amongst the writers once they saw this turkey was beyond hope.You are faced with choosing amongst so-so reviews or all out negative like this. I am tempted to say anyone writing a positive review on this movie is a paid flack, a shill, but maybe it is just irrationaly loyal Ford fans. Check the histories of the positive reviews before you buy. I gave it a star for the title, I probably bought for the title as I don't usually buy star movies with such lukewarm (at best) prof reviews."
3,so so,"ok if u like alien movie, didnt really hold our attention, no a realy big rating from us, sorry i bought it"
4,Good movie but for one big flaw.....,"Great cast...Harrison Ford, that new James Bond guy....13 from House, David Carradine's brother, ect ect.One thing I cant get over is this Alien, they make him look all big and ugly, just a wild beast with the brains of a Tiger....yet I am to somehow believe that this Intelligent Extra Terrestrial (who has the brains of a beast mind you) Built this space ship they were flying around?? Come on! Such an advanced lifeform , builds a ship and flies across the galaxy and just blows up stuff and ropes men and women, so stupid!"
4,Such a FUN movie!,"This movie is really different. I really liked it. The aliens are pretty cool. Love Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. Lots of action and some great special effects."
3,Just don't go in thinking it going to be a great movie.,"I didn't go into this movie with great expectations. It was okay but the plot was just redone in a western setting. I give them credit for such big name actors being on board this project. It could have been much better, but at least my kid thought it was great."
3,"Decent Movie, horrible product.","I should have known this is one of the ""UV Digital Copy"" packages. I HATE UV digital copies. It's server based and streaming, you have options do download but have to use Flixster. They did include an iTunes copy but it can't be transferred to either my iPad nor my iPhone, WHAT USE IS THAT???!!! I will never again buy any UV product, give me my digital copy as MY copy and not tied to a studio who can take it away any time they want. This UV thing is nothing but digital DIVX and needs to die and die fast.As a movie, it's a fairly fun popcorn flick. Wish I just bought the movie only copy. Buyer beware."
4,Sweet and Sour Pork,I like this movie for its creative way of weaving sci-fi with the old fashion western. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford star in a action packed movie that will have you on the edge of your seat rooting for mankind. I recommend this movie to all true lovers of the American western movis and those sci-fi fans.
5,Harrison Ford shines bright in this combination science-fiction and cowboy-western epic!,Greetings & Salutations! This rather unusual film that combines science-fiction and the cowboy-western adds a touch of gallows humour without the obilgatory love scenes that cause the viewer to go to the concession stand for more popcorn or at home on DVD sending one to the firdge for another six-pack and fried pork rinds or chips and dip!
4,"Loved the movie, but the disk is messed up",The movie was fun and exciting. If you like old 1950's monster movies you will love it.There is a problem with the disk though. I could not sync the sound with the video. Allmy other blu-ray disks work fine. Other than this. GREAT MOVIE.
4,Interesting Retro Alien Invasion Flick,"This film has teamed up two great actors (although some critics says that they lacked chemistry - I disagree). The film has good measures of suspense, action and some emotional depth.The movie (based in 1873, Arizona) starts off with an outlaw [Daniel Craig] that has a strange device around one of his wrists. However, he is unable to remove this object. Just like a typical adventure game, he has no memory of his recent past, as the movie unfolds he begins to get flashbacks.What makes this movie unique is its time setting, hence it does not come across like another one of those alien invasion films that have flooded cinemas over the last couple of years."
4,Sci-Fi meets the old west....,"OK, I knew going in that the story line would be off a bit. But even with that, it was still a pretty good movies. Suitable for all ages, almost. I do have to admit that some of the graphics were well done. Think I'd like to have the bracelet. Enjoy!"
3,Not bad....,"Not bad for a movie that has both cowboys AND aliens. It's nice seeing Ford as something of a badguy at first. Plenty of action, but even with both Craig and Ford it was just another ""aliens try to take over earth"" plot. We all know how those end. ;P"
4,Good Escapism,"I don't know why this hasn't been done before. The title seems like a comedy, but it isn't! The cowboys are the good guys who get help from the indians to battle the bad guys (the aliens). Neat special effects, but not overdone. The bad guys have changed, but the premise is the same. I enjoyed the movie."
4,Entertaining,This was alot better than I thought it would be from the trailers. Good action too. Nice twist to a western.
3,"Not too bad, Not too great.","This is a typical Alien movie set in the Old West. Character development was good, there was a little twist in the middle but nothing too surprising. If you like a good old fashioned Western meets Aliens this is worth the $4.00 rental but don't expect to talk about it at the water cooler tomorrow."
4,Cowboys take on Aliens in action packed movie.,Cowboys take on Aliens in action packed movie. Great story line never attempted before and done extremely well. Strength of character shines from many of the actors and especially to 2 leading men and Olivia.
4,Not a movie for those without an imagination,"I enjoyed the movie. If you just let yourself enjoy it and do not try to pick part the impossibilities it is a fun ride. If you want reality watch the history channel or science channel. Little hokie in parts, but interesting and fun."
4,Good.,This movie was pretty good. The only thing about the extended version is that it felt like it went on forever. I would recommend for when you have a movie night and it is not to late.
2,Nothing original or very entertaining,"There is nothing original or very entertaining in this movie. I've seen those aliens in other movies. They are always slimy. They are technologically advanced, but really stupid and we can easily defeat them. There is always a space ship that has a core which has to be blown up. Of course, wrist weapon is a must, aliens' version of Spiderman weapon. Craig is good for a hero. Ford's face say ""angry"" and too tired to walk more than 10 steps."
4,awesome,received product ontime great item would buy again no problems here. What is the deal with the work requirement to submit ughhh
4,movie,"Unusual plot for a western,but interesting. No stage coaches,bank robberies,indian fights,saloon brawls,long cattle and trail rides or hero saving herroin."
3,Its Cowboys...and Aliens. What more could you want? lol,"The title says it all. And I loved it for it. Though a story is practically non-existent, and parts of the film make no logical sense, the brilliant acting by Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde and the awesome special effects make it definitely worth at least on viewing. Aside form some pretty horrible plot holes, the film is shot beautifully. Director Jon Favreau and executive producer Steven Spielberg bring some really amazing visuals to the screen. All in all, a really fun and entertaining film to watch when you just want to see cowboys and aliens fighting. Its definitely a good time."
1,Booo......,This is the first movie in a long time where I wish I could get my money back. What a waist of $3.99 and two hours of my life.
1,Wonder how much everyone was paid...,"Everyone in this movie must have owed someone a huge favor. The movie was horrible, and the acting was not good either. I am sure they all made this movie for the studio to make some other movie!?"
1,Disappointment,"I thought from the title and the previews that this would be a fun movie. It was instead muddled and confused and the two male leads were sleep walking through the film. I feel sorry for the other actors and the director who seemed to try to make this a fun popcorn movie. Interesting premise, muddled script and poor execution with tired leads."
4,Ignore the whiners--best aliens since Alien,"Ignore the whiners--best aliens since Alien. Great effects, great cast, flawless production values and great concept.Makes Stephen Hawkings words about the dangers of first contact reasonable to say the least.Ella's line ""they see you (humans) as insects"" chilling. A close second to Stargate.Some uneven editing but didn't break my suspension of disbelief."
3,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"the previews to this movie got everyone excited to see this. i went to the theater believing i was going to see a big battle between Cowboys and Aliens. sadly the battle is not so big and the movie tends to focus***SPOILER ALERT*** more on the mystery of who the girl (Olivia Wilde) is and where she comes from.***END OF SPOILER***the big highlights from the previews are actually not so big and pretty much what you see in the previews. nothing new. Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig do a great job but is not enough to keep you interested. if you think you're going to see an ""Independence Day"" ala Will Smith style you will be very very disappointed. that is what i thought and would have loved this movie to be but it's not. i give this movie 3 stars because its not complete trash and the actors did a great job and there is so much potential to the movie but it's worth a rent not a buy."
3,B-movie concept with A-grade production,"This is really a B-movie, but it has A-grade production and actors... really big actors like Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig. If I was to rate this as a B-Movie, I'd give it 5-stars. It has the typical sci-fi weirdness and strange, sometimes random, plot elements you would expect to see in a B-movie. However, the heavily-invested production and actors do nothing more than take away the B-Movie cheapness in the visuals and acting. It still has that weird ""cult classic"" feel that appeals to a niche rather than a mainstream audience. All in all, it was disappointing. It lacks that mainstream appeal that an A-movie should have.If you're an avid B-movie viewer, you might like this A LOT. Otherwise, you may feel lukewarm about seeing it twice."
1,Horrible in every way possible!,"Jon Favreau should be put in director hell forever for making this POS movie. It's really only about ""hey, let's all collect our checks"" and screw the audience. I was speechless at the bad writing, acting, directing, you name it, a new low for Hollywood horrible! Harrison Ford is so laughable in his performance, might be the only saving grace, for an otherwise worthless effort."
2,Not a good western and not a good sci-fy movie,Did not do it for my dad who loves westerns and did not do it for me who loves Sci-Fy.
1,Ugh,Very disappointing considering the cast and director. Mr. Ford's grumpiness changed too abruptly to make much sense. The wide ranging groups remind me of that terrible McKenna's Gold. If I could return this movie I would.
2,"Ok, not great nor memorable","Okay movie for a rainy weekend and nothing else to do. Acting is okay, well it is just an ok movie all around."
1,Worst of the year,"Whoever rated Sherlock Holmes II the worst movie of the year, obviously didn't see Cowboys and Aliens. It was just plain silly with no coherent plot and nothing making any sense. If you want to see good thoughtful and thought-provoking recent science fiction movies watch ""Moon"" or ""Source Code"". Cowboys and Aliens is just a junk movie."
3,Bond western style',I think Daniel Craig is trying to avoid being typecast as 007. Well it helps to have Harrison Ford backing you up.Not a great movie but science fiction fans will be satisfied with the results.
4,this Book Grabs your interst from the openbing scene....,"I really enjoyed this movie; probably because of the Cast.....I am waiting for someone to produce the ""Ant"" People....that American Indians fought and killed in the 19th century."
4,"This is one odd idea, but it works!","I first saw this one on DVD rental and liked it so I decided to get myself the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack. A strange idea cowboys and Indians in a western fighting together instead of against each other but it looks good on screen.I was never completely clear on what the aliens wanted with the gold (even making the effort to steal the handful that Daniel Craig's (James Bond in an American western(?) character had just stolen) or just why a Riverboat was found upside down 100's of miles from a river but for check your brain fun and good looking action- this movie has it.For such an odd mix up of ideas this is not a bad movie, give it a try."
4,Great Story,"Love the twist in this movie, Harrison Ford is great as the tyrannical father and Craig does a great job of looking confused through most of the movie. Really wish they had shown Olivia Wilde's alien form though. This is also a pretty good graphic novel"
2,thought it would be fun...,"....but it was a bit too formulaic and executed for my tastes. it could make for a no-thinking, more action than fun movie night. but i think you could probably find something better."
5,Yeehaaw,"If you are into good old cowboy movies, and alien invasion type movies, this combo will not let you down. Normal alien movies take place during the present, so it's fun to see how cowboys of the old west would handle an alien attack. Story line may not be to some people's liking or find it boring, but it was everything I hoped it would be when I saw it. Felt good. XD"
2,don't bother,"This movie is just as idiotic as the title would suggest. 90% of it is a decent western, 10% is poorly done horror movie. If they would have made it into a straight western it would have made more sense. Those looking for horror should pick another movie as you'll likely be disappointed. And to top it off the aliens were very badly done - looking like something right out of a 50s B movie. For me, I am sorry I wasted my $4."
5,Cowboys & Aliens,It a movie to set back and enjoy action. It is a movie that you do not have think about. Just enjoy it.
5,A Great Movie Concept,"I am amazed that no one thought of this idea sooner. I am not crazy about cowboy and Indians movies because the Indian is usually portrayed so falsely in every way. But the aliens in this movie were truly the bad guys. The movie was engaging, amusing and downright funny in many places. We LOVED it!"
1,Worse than you can imagine.,The storyline is so weak and disorganized I was embarrassed to be watching this stupid flick. Really felt bad for the actors that took the money to make this ridiculous movie. It is essentially unwatchable.
2,Slept through part of it,"I love westerns, but am bored to death by aliens.The movie started out as an acceptable (though not great)western, but once the aliens showed up I started thinkingabout my grocery list, vacuuming the living room, anddentist appointments.I found the ""mix"" to be awkwardly put together,like they were trying to do something fresh and newand entertaining, but it was just wrong. The hot chickseemed to be thrown in there gratuitously, and didn'treally fit the part she played. She's better than that,as she played a lesbian doctor on House quite well.Harrison Ford, well, he just isn't Indiana Jones anymore.Sorry, Indy.I watched it because my husband wanted to,so I had a nice nap. Sleep is a good thing."
1,Cowboys and Idiots,"Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig movie HAS to be great, right?Not.Very poorly crafted with scenes and dialogue definitely ""Alien"" to this earthling. Stupid. Disappointed Daniel and Harrison did NOT ""get it"" and prevent it from being aired.Musta been a great easy money paycheck for them but I will NOT trust their names as evidence it MUST be good.This was terrible.Respectfully yoursAndy in Maine"
1,POS!,Save yourself time and money by not watching this movie. It is one of the biggest POS movies I have ever seen in my life. It is a terrible waste of having good actors in this movie. Read up on other negative reviews to get an idea on just how terrible this dog is.
2,Did I miss something?,"I was expecting a good movie after reading a few of these reviews. Not so. This was sour from the beginning. Poorly written, mediocre acting, confused direction, and wildly edited. Nothing seems to have worked except some special effects (CGI). It looks more like a patchwork than a main stream production. Many big guns does not a good movie make.Those big guns lost control and ended up with a ""B"" movie at best. Rather disappointing.This crew might benefit from someone like Joss Whedon (Firefly - Serenity). He knows how to make a Western/SciFi."
3,Ok,I think it is stupid I have to write 18 words to rate a movie. I think the stars should be enough.
2,You've been warned,"I wanted to like it. But the system of embedded cliches, uninteresting characters and dopey plot outlines just made it impossible on all levels. Only Sam Rockwell infuses much-needed oxygen into the story in his sadly small part. You've been warned."
2,"Bad script, bad genre and bad acting",Would not recommend this movie to anyone able to form two or more sylables. I had the movie recommended by a friend and I need to hold an intervention for Him since He actually liked this bag of kitty litter. The actors must of been hard up for money because I have no idea why they would star in this vehicle of imbrededness.
1,Movie,This was recommended by a family member but we did not like it at all! Will read reviews more closely in the future.
5,great,The product was just great and a lot of fun. Would definitely buy again. Thanks for your help and speed.
2,AND?,tiresome acting with over the top special effects. it's getting old. what should of been a blockbuster leaves me wanting my money back and the 2 hrs spent watching this movie.
3,Too much too soon,"Plausibility is everything in a science fiction movie and this one lacks because you're always looking at the protagonist wondering where he got his super gun and his special powers from... but yes, you do get a full explanation at the end of the movie; one that feels contrived and glued on (with cheap glue)."
1,Actors must really have needed the money!,"We knew when we ordered this that is was going to be different. It was a waste of time and not entertaining. We continued to watch just so not to waste the money. You shook your head thru the whole movie. It was strange that none of the indians or town people where scared seeing the alien's flying vehicles (for lack of a better word). The cast must have really needed the money, I bet none of them put this on their resume."
3,Straight to the point,"Straight to the point. This movie was what I thought was my ideal movie, cowboy sci-fi action thriller. What could go wrong? I'll tell what went wrong the entire middle of this movie is stupid. It loses it's way. The story could have been so much better if they would have figured out the end before the beginning. Just seems like they where winging it."
1,Could of been a real hit... BUT,"I mistakenly purchased this flop on blu ray prior to seeing this in advance. This was a HUGE mistake. With the cast of this movie I thought it had to be great, with top notch performances and high production values.I was terribly wrong. The entire movie was not only predictable, but also poorly acted and boring. Oh well live and learn!I gave it away... I simply did not even want it in the house.. Please don't be a fool and purchase this movie before watching in advance, it may be your cup of tea, but it was NOT mine."
1,"bad movie - really bad, boring movie","This was our first movie to rent from Amazon and stream. No fault of Amazon's, but ouch - what a boring movie. My husband enjoyed it because he mistook it for campy, but everyone else thought it was just a too-long, dull story about cowboys, full of bad acting and punctuated by a few moments here and there of B or C special effects."
4,Cowboys and Aliens,"A new and different approach to a sci-fi flick which makes it interesting, enjoyable and just a really good movie to watch. Catch this one if you can, you won't be disappointed."
3,Good for what's Alien you,"Someone once said there is nothing new. It is just cowboys and aliens. Well that is the title. The title could be a bit misleading as the aliens could be the type that crosses the border.In any event this is a fun movie full of actions, surprises, romance, and gold. There is a lot of talent involved and a chance to notice one again how Harrison Ford can easily slip in to the tough old man parts.The film starts out great with rough and tough cowboys. One cannot remember who he is. Or how he got his strange bracelet that he cannot seem to get off. Oh and I doubt it would be any surprise to say that somewhere down the ling aliens will get involved. Can't go in to too much detail as there are a lot of surprises, twists and turns.Be sure to watch all the DVD extras."
2,Nothing Spectacular,Not good as a western and very short on science in the science fiction category. A couple of big name stars that will surely be nominated for razzies.
2,Interesting Characters Shoved into a Terrible Story,"I rented this movie due to seeing a preview in theaters. I was expecting an exciting action movie and a terrible story line. Instead you got a mix of a love story, a tale of redemption, a tale of revenge, and a tale of the potential for humanity to be destroyed. And none of these stories were very good. On top of that there is about 30 minutes of action in the entire film. But if you love bad western and bad sci-fi, this might be the movie for you."
4,Fun and cliche at the same time.,"It's strange how a movie about cowboys and aliens can be both original and a bit cliche at the same time. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but the human drama in between alien attacks is old fashioned and familiar. Example? Gruff, stubborn rancher Harrison Ford distrusts Indians, but later has to save the Indian chief in the heat of battle, and the two make eye contact and nod to each other out of respect. As a fan of westerns, i've seen that moment countless times before in other movies. Still, its all in good fun and very well produced. Daniel Craig makes a great cowboy and Harrison Ford was excellent. I bought it before seeing the film, based on the premise, and i was not disappointed."
3,Mediocore,"Wasn't at all what I expected! Too much drama and love story not enough shootin aliens, like I hoped. Wish I had of rented instead of bought!"
3,Turn your brain off and enjoy,OK this is the type of movie you watch for sheer enjoyment. If you try to fill the holes in the plot or rationalize it in anyway you will miss out on the fun. It is silly and stupid and has every stock character you can image. It is full of good actors performing for a fat pay check. Don't waste your time if you think you are going to be moved or walk away thinking you have seen another sci-fi parable. Simply turn off your brain and enjoy.
2,Entertaining but not Ford or Craig's best work,"This was fun for the kids, but for the adults it quickly became a matter of endurance. Of course, this should have been expected given the title and basic premise."
4,excellent,"We Five had a hit with ""You Were On My Mind"" in 1967.It is the most rock oriented song on this album. By and large this is a mellow affair, with covers of ""Tonight,"" from West Side Story, and ""Cast Your Fate TO The Wind.""But what makes We Five so good is they keep their vocal music in a folk vain. There is little orchestration here, and this music thus sounds like it could have been sung by 1960s college kids strumming on a street corner.And We Five maintained their excellence: when most vocal groups were getting more sappy as rock got harder, We Five pushed in a more rustic and rocky direction. Check outCatch the Windto see what this band could do when psychedelia made vocal silk no longer viable.The Vogues, the Letterman, We Five had it all over their coral contemporaries, and some of the rock ones, too."
3,Get new zip ties!,Great cover for dog run but the zip ties that came w/it were so old and brittle they just snapped as I tried to use them!
4,Cool,Put it on top of the kennel and it's 15 degrees cooler ! The ties weren't the best for the application but the cover is awesome !
3,Not The Best,"These are by no means meant for precision shooting. They will suffice for making hunting and plinking rounds. Although who plinks with a 300 Win Mag? For precision match ammo you need to spend a lot more money for competition dies, example Redding type S. The upside is, the Lee neck sizing die is quite good and well received among those who want control over neck tension."
1,Yucko.,"Fushigi Yuugi - quite possibly the most overrated shoujo anime ever. Formulaic plots, whiny one-dimensional ""heroines,"" super cheesey dialogue, and lazy animation to boot. Stay clear of this one!"
3,Rock the Boat,"The Fushigi Yugi movies are addictive, but also can get annoying. The dubbing has a few flaws, because the main character, Miaka, gets very very annoying with her stupid act, and chumpy voice. Her friend Yui is also very annoying, and they both ruin the movies. Another thing is, that the intermission breaks are very annoying. You will be at a very serious part and then this annoying music and chibi characters come out. If it was made more seriously, and had a little more depth it would be the ultimate, but right now it's just a great movie that grates on your nerves a little bit. I would reccomend renting the first one, not buying right away. If you get addicted than go ahead and buy, but give it a test run first!>>cheers<<"
5,The Enchanting Story,"This anime touched my heart completly and is by far to me the most interesting anime I've ever watched. The love, the drama, the funny, the sadness, the rage, was all contained in the ""Mysterious Play"" It had me so moved that I even wished that something of such existed in the real world."
2,Anime,The storyline gets a little dark and the characters are more extreme than usual. This makes for a somewhat grating flick.
1,Disappointing and unintelligent,"I can't belive I ordered this thing.First of all, it wasn't created with DVD in mind, so the quality isn't too good (unlike Cowboy Bebop, for example). But the main problem is that this thing sucks so much!It was nice and funny until episode 9, but after that it started to be based on tragedies.. just like that, with no warnings.In addition, Miaka, the main character, is horribly dumb, and it doesn't make sense that such a bucko would lead the gang. There's bad mixture between humor and tragedy there, and the music repeats itself too - you'll get sick of it very soon.The characters look cute, though. So I'd recommend downloading pictures of them instead of buying this."
2,Not worth the money,"As other reviewers have said, this series tackles dark topics such as rape. I find it interesting that they tackle these topics with a ditzy one dimensional lead character who's traits include gluttony and stupidity. Its not a bad series, it just isn't a quality series, and the transfer isn't a quality job. ...I suggest you buy something with a slightly better storyline, with better, more realistic characters... FY doesn't have the same caliber that other series have out there. And to make matters worse the second season is much worse, so you can't look forward to the series possibly getting better."
3,Miaka and Yui,"I absolutely hate Miaka and Yui because they are both (...). For instance, Miaka ended up having all the bishounen in the Suzaku side fall in love with her. Now, I don't really understand this, since I think Miaka is only a freakish (...)who constantly binges on food. Now, Yui is very stupid also and doesn't deserve Nakago's attention(even though he's only using her). She's also whiny. Other than these two characters and Tamahome, the series is really cool with better animations than the manga(believe me, the profiles stink). Nice fighting scene between Hotohori and Tamahome too."
4,Once upon a time,"Before my ex and I separated, this was one of the first animes we watched together. One of the ones that truly brought us together in the beginning. Full of romance and mysticism, heroes and villains, magic and gods. Wishes and dreams.You'll become well acquainted with the cast of characters -- annoyed with the same things they're annoyed about in each other's personalities, and if you fall far enough into the story you may even shed a tear or two. All in all a good experience, particularly if you let it carry you away with it.Sidebar:This isn't a cheap set, but it's worth it -- don't loan it to someone who isn't a good friend. You'll miss it if you don't get it back."
5,One the best anime series I've seen,"This series is just awesome. If your the type that likes a movie with a little of everything (comedy, action, drama, etc.), well this is the one to check out. The storyline just engulfs you. You want everything to go right, but somehow something gets in the way. Overall, it is one the best anime series that I ever seen. You can't go wrong with this anime."
5,"It's good, ya know?","Romance (LOTS of romance), humor, drama, and magic all rolled into one. WOW! Characters that are all endearing -- it's really hard to pick a favorite -- and villains that make you want to grind your teeth. An extremely likeable heroine, a well-motivated antagonist, two gorgeous contending males, and well-defined supporting characters. Engrossing storyline that is chock full of hints of more to come. Yes, it's probably for more mature audiences due to some nudity prat falls and adult themes, but it's incredible. This series is like a good book -- once you pick it up you can't stop until you get to the end. One request though: if you're going to watch it, watch the subtitled version. The dub is okay, but the original is much, MUCH better."
5,Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play - Volume 1 Suzaku Box Set,"This is one of my most favorite anime ever. The VHS is nothing like the DVD set. It has so many features, it's worth the price. If you you love anime especially the Fushigi Yugi series, join Miaka, Tamahome, & HotoHori on an epic adventure to bring Miaka home!"
5,Laugh and Cry,"Oh, I just LOVE this anime series! ^^ I bought this with birthday and Christmas money, and it was worth every penny! I laughed so hard my sides ached, and cried my eyes out. I adore all the characters, I don't have a favorite. (Except for the Emperor of Kutou, I hate his guts, but I really don't know of anyone that likes him...)"
3,"Tamahome, Tamahome, Tamahome, Tamahome.......","I forked out the money for this first set, relying upon it's merits from these reviews. Don't trust them unless you want to sit through hours of TAMAHOME, TAMAHOME etc.. The story is quite engaging hence the 3 stars, but be warned Tamahome the leading man is used at overkill.I have been a fan of Anime for around 11-12 years and have seen many great and some rubbish shows. This one could be good if not for the 10,000,000 times Tamahomes name is said! Evangelion, Bebop, Lain, Jin Roh, Honneamise and many more great shows. See these before seeing this, but watch this before the devastatingly awful Nadesico!"
4,I hope i help,i thought this movie is great there is mushy stuff but there is also a lot of action. Oh yeah i cant forget about the comedy its very interesting and after you watch the first one you might be like me and buy the rest well i hope i helped :-)
2,The First Half of This Series Needs a Debunking,"I like Fushigi Yuugi, but you know what? The first half wasn't very good. The second half is so much better despite the fact that Tamahome and Miaka are as prevailent as ever. The first half was mediocre at best. Weak animation and bland coloring, plenty of Miaka and Tamahome, and not nearly enough Seiryu action or enough Yui screentime. I don't understand all this Yui bashing Yui is wonderfully developed character. She's infinentely interesting to watch. While Miaka............ >.< When people point out her ""good traits"", they aren't very good and don't make up for her predictability. All the eating so much jokes are nice and dandy but it's old. REALLY old. It's not funny anymore. Just find a place to rent these tapes subtitled (its dub is bad and it sucks in the second half too) because it's necessary to see the first half for the second half to make sense."
5,Essential for Anyone Seeking To Become a Leader,"I have wasted a ton of money on management books -- which are now gathering dust in the bookshelves. Most were written by academics who provide the most obvious answers to complex organizational issues.Robert Quinn -- while an academic -- never leaves my desk at work. In Deep Change, Becoming a Master Manager and Diagnosing and Changing Organizational Culture, Quinn shows a deep understanding of organizational life and the fact that systems do not transform without our own individual transformation. But, he doesn't stop there. His work provides concrete tools to guide your individual transformation and your company's culture.Outstanding work; pleasure to read! Thank you!"
3,Some good ideas,"The author states that people and organizations need to change and grow or they will die. He is less clear about how one is to select what needs to be changed. It seems to require a vision of the future and how the organization can/should fit in. I found his leit motif of ""slow death"" and ""deep change"" to be tiresome. If the book reminds leaders that they can't endlessly rest of their laurels, it would probably be useful."
4,Deep Change x 2,"Somehow in ordering the book on your system, I wound up ordering two books - one from Amazon and one from a ""used"" book supplier. I was able to resell the second book but very confused how I mistakenly ordered the two copies.Any ideas how to prevent this in the future"
4,Change at a Core Level,"This book is for readers who are ready to look inside themselves in order to change their organizations. It isn't a book for novices. You need a fair amount of business experience to have the perspective to understand author Robert E. Quinn's message. Likewise, you need to have enough invested in your current organization to care if it changes. Quinn offers some theoretical analysis, but leavens it with ample practical examples and exercises. If you have a job, rather than a career, or if you are committed to staying in a narrow, technical field or just waiting for your retirement, skip this book. However, if you're willing to engage in extended self-examination, we suggest this to you. However, be warned that that many of Quinn's drills are emotionally challenging, such as identifying how you resist change or pegging which elements of your organization are more committed to the status quo than to success. But, then, whoever said change was easy?"
5,Life-Changer,This has become one of my top 5 favorite books... A real life-changer at the professional and personal levels.
5,Best PM&R labcoat book!,"An excellent resource for anyone in a rehabilitation field. Has a surprisingly large amount of information that is easily accessible and well organized. This book will be especially useful for residents entering rehabilitation medicine. This is by far the best of the ""labcoat"" sized books in PM&R."
2,Disappointing,"I have a large collection of Osprey books which are very good but this book is a disappointment because it is not very accurate. Most of the material in this book came directly from wartime intelligence publications with mistakes which have not been corrected. There are too many mistakes to cover them all here but one example is on the first line of page 58 which says that ""the portable steel pillbox was only encountered during the November 1943 assault on Betio."" This is wrong because there were some encountered in the Aleutian Islands. More and better research should be done before a book is published."
1,Haven't seen ANYTHING worse than this.,"I've bought one and now regret it alot. The video quality is, by far, the worst I've ever seen on DVD, looks like it was recorded from live TV broadcast by a 30 years old VCR plugged into a 40 years old TV set, and the cassete spent 2 to 3 years on some electric magnet before being digitized to DVD.Not much documentary footage, but alot of the host speculations are filmed, making it look like a bad case of some TV show. Don't even think of buying - if you want a Gulf war documentary look at ""Desert Triumf"" which is not perfect, but light years ahead of this title."
4,Why no region 1?,"My husband works in the AF in NBC readiness. We saw this movie years ago and he's been wanting it. The one I'm thinking of was a drama, not a documentery, about Gulf War Syndrome. I can't find this anywhere on DVD for region 1. So the christmas shopping continues..."
3,Gulf War: First Strike - Winds of the Storm,"Curious that the title shown during the film is NOT the title on the cover of the box. Still, a thorough & engrossing review of Coalition air activities during this historic conflict."
3,"Milking the ""Drucker"" Cow!","Peter Drucker was the father of the post war business revolution.And his every books will stand the test of time as he shaped modern business practises from Watson to Ford to Gates.With due respect, this book is just a reflection of the genius who still sparkles sporadically with his genius thoughts and this book is mediocre..by the standards that Drucker set in his haydays...A compilation of articles and Interviews, each chapters and sections have no relationship to the title of the book and excessive importance given to Japan and hardly any reference to India and China makes it irrelevant..And US's foreign policy messups /Sep11 did not exist then.Yet think about his predictions on Japan on many fronts ( ex:Bureacracy) and replace Japan with India/China and you have the answer..Skip this book and go on to other Drucker's book written 25 or 30 years earlier when he was still relatively young.Read Ram Charan, Prahalad's book for latest business wisdom as well"
2,Collection of Exerpts,"This book is an interesting collection of chapters, interviews and ideas by Drucker. There are a handful of good ideas, but as a whole, the book is disjointed and no clear point or argument is raised. While it is good fodder for quotes, don't expect to emerge with any great ideas or new perspectives."
3,"Good, solid book.","This book is the second full text that I have read from Drucker. During my MBA days I was also exposed to/emersed in many of his articles and theories. I have always found him to be insightful and thought provoking. For some reason, particularly with this text, I found his style and delivery to be long-winded and somewhat arrogant. Reading between the lines, his message is clear -- we are at the beginning of the revolution...there is so much more to come.Good book -- a step above most authors. Middle of the road for Drucker however."
2,A disappointment!,"Half of the book show pictures of patterns; pictures that you can obtain for free when you order an item from M'Fay.com, the other half of the book...not to great."
2,"Okay book, but not really about waterbirth","I expected more information about, um, waterbirth---tips and techniques for getting the most out of laboring and birthing in water, positions to try, safety information, etc. Instead, this is a pretty generic childbirth book by an author who used water for her children's births. She does provide her own birth stories, but these offer no practical information for a reader's own waterbirth. I suppose that if you didn't realize the water should be warm, that would be a tip---but who doesn't know that? Bizarre. On the plus side, I liked the yoga routine she suggests. Otherwise, I got nothing out of this book & I'm glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it! (On a side note, the more childbirth books I read, the more I realize that they all say the same thing! You really only need one good one; I recommend Ina May's Guide to Childbirth.)"
5,Choosing Waterbirth : Reclaiming the Sacred Power of Birth,"This book is wonderful! I was really hoping for a waterbirth for my first child, however she decided to come too early for me to have it at the birthing center. But this book was excellent in preparing me mentally what it would be like to go through labor and birth, and helped me learn the mindset to be in during labor. It has great instructions for prenatal yoga, and is a very easy read. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in waterbirth, or simply getting in a more peaceful frame of mind for labor."
4,I like this record,"I really like this album, it grows on you. I bought it when it came out in 1977. I liked Winwood's previous groups - Spencer Davis and Traffic. I have read critical reviews over the years where the record is dismissed as being ""a disapointment"", however I don't share that view. The album stands up to repeated playing. On a Sunday morning, when you look through things to play, it is something that I have frequently returned to over the last 21 years. In my opinion it was also the last good record that Stevie Winwood made. His future records employed a formula which worked for a time, but were ultimately spiritually and emotionally bankrupt. I bought the Traffic re-union album ""Far from Home"" expecting something with more inspiration, and this was where the formula reached its nadir - it's was awful and predictable. ""Steve Winwood"" represented the last gasp of a man who in future years made dull, formulaic commercial records in order to maintain his standard of living."
1,What a disappointment,"THIS is little Stevie Winwood who was so brilliant with the Spencer Davis Group and Traffic? ""Time Is Running Out,"" with its disco beat, sounds like late-period Doobie Brothers, for crying out loud. Give this a pass, and go buy The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys."
3,Steve Winwood on Sedatives,"""Steve Winwood"" has to rank as one of the most disappointing solo debuts by an already accomplished artist.Gone is the high-octane R&B of ""Gimme Some Lovin."" Gone is the eclectic experimentation of Traffic andBlind Faith. And the slick, pop-rock genius of ""Back in the High Life"" and ""Roll With It"" is still nowhere to beseen. Instead, we have extremely mellow, laid-back late '70s sludge. While ""Midland Maniac"" and ""VacantChair"" have some interesting hooks, the rest of the album reveals no musical spark or inspiration whatsoever,and the wailing refrain of ""Let Me Make Something in Your Life"" is absolutely awful. The overall effect issimply depressing. In short, ""Steve Winwood"" is for charitable fans and/or completists only."
3,. . . `something in your life' has legs,"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ if the world of steve winwood fans could be said to be divided into two parts, this album would mark the effective musical end of the first.when winwood was merely a rocking prodigy, the vitality of songs like `gimme some lovin'' and `i'm a man' resonated in ways that later songs with hooks (`back in the high life') could not. his genius was as spokesman for the pubescent, and like most adolescents, he grew up.for those who connect with the unencumbered energy of the early songs, `steve winwood' is a CD to be owned. there is one reason above the other five: `let me make something in your life'.more than 20 years after my first hearing, i use it's plaintive message to buttress my inclination to heal wounded psycho-sexual relationships. `i've had all i can take of your trouble and strife, . . .'.but maybe it is a theme song for enablers . . .."
5,"Great apron, great price","I don't know why other people would not give this a 5 star. Great price, yes, it does lay a little low but you have to get it over your head, just use a safety pin to bring it up closer to the neckline. Long, thick tie strings make it easy to tie in the back by yourself."
2,Cheaply made!,I was thrilled to find this Browns apron for a friend. I was disappointed when I received it. While it is packaged nicely you immediately notice how thin & flimsy the fabric is - it is actually see through!! This is a good novelty item but DON'T BUY if you want to actually WEAR IT/USE IT.
2,cool gift,it feels cheaply made i got it as a gift for my brother and it looks cheap lets see how long it will last
2,Very Thin!,"This apron is made of cotton, but is extremely thin. More of a gauzy material than anything that would actually protect your clothing during cooking. And for the price it does not live up to expectations."
4,Great gift for man or woman,"Bought this for my boyfriend. He really likes it. It should be a little higher around the neck line, but should do the trick."
4,NFL Tampa Bay Buccs Apron,"Package was delivered very quickly! The apron material was thinner than I expected and is somewhat sheer but it gets the job done. I wish the strap around the neck was adjustable because its pretty long but For the price, im happy with this product."
3,"Mediocre, like the Dolphins.","Do yourself a huge favor and try your hardest NOT to wash this product. I know, tough when it's an apron and you're either BBQ'ing or cooking, sauces and juices flying everywhere. The logo fades quickly after two to three washes sort of negating the need for a logo in the first place. Works fine, does what it does, annoying that it's not made better."
2,Would not recommend,My husband loves all things Miami Dolphins so he was happy to receive this. I felt the apron was thin and cheaply made and will not likely hold up to many washings. I am not happy with this purchase.
5,Excellent service,"The product was great, but the service was exceptional. This company went out of their way to make a happy customer, and it worked. I would recomend them to all."
2,Poor craftsmenship,"It took my wife examining this apron for me to realize that it is not well-made. As with other clothing she has examined from Pakistan, the quality control is poor, the stitching in some places looks like it was done by someone who was not paying attention. It wanders around, instead of being in a straight line, with loose threads hanging here and there. Unless you can take this item out of the package and examine it carefully, I would recommend finding something else to buy."
1,DID NOT RECIEVE THIS ITEM,"I purchased this item on NOV. 21, and I have not recieved it yet. I do have the tracking information, but from Nov. 24th, it shows the same information telling me that the pakeage is in transit. I want to know if I can ever get my stuff."
4,NY Jets Apron,This was a gift for my mother-in-law and she loved it. There is nothing better than a happy mother-in-law since it equals a happy wife. :)
3,Great for hard-core Pats fans,"Which my sister is. She loved it. A bit thin for a ""cook's apron,"" which is why I deducted two stars."
3,Maybe a misunderstanding!,"The service as far as shipng and handlng was great, However,when I ordered this apron for a gift, the picture that I saw is not what I got.I do not know how that happen. I tried to contact the seller and was not able to reach themat the time.For the price it was good, and I really needed this apron in a hurry so I kept it.But I can not rate it, as it was a gift. Overall all turned out O.K. after all."
4,Amazing story,"Was interested in learning more about her after she became a saint, and this book is a great resource for that. Amazing story about an amazing woman."
3,Not a great skin flick....,"There's a lot of bikini shots of this great looking actress and some suggestive situations, but no actual nudity. There's one brief shot of another actress running through the frame topless, not very arousing. The bikin model looks great.It was kind of a funny movie."
4,Winwood's First Success as a Solo Artist,"""Talking Back to the Night"" is relatively average early '80s pop-rock. Following Winwood's uninterestingself-titled solo debut and unlistenable sophomore release ""Arc of a Diver,"" however, it sounds like a minormasterpiece. While still weighed down by a few lifeless songs (""Big Girls Walk Away,"" ""It Was Happiness"")and cheesy synthesizers, ""Talking Back..."" actually features several great songs. ""Valerie"" was a precursor ofpop genius to come, pop-rock anthem ""Still in the Game"" is probably Winwood's most underappreciatedrecording, and ""And I Go"" and ""There's a River"" are his earliest successes at strong adult contemporaryballads. Furthermore, Winwood's synthesizer technique begins maturing here into a distinct and original sound(which he would later perfect on songs like ""The Finer Things""), rather than an artificial replacement for otherinstruments. It took three albums, but Winwood finally found his voice as a solo artist with this release."
3,Winwood's Best Album,"I would actually give it 3 1/2 stars, and I am a very hard grader. (For example, I would give 5 stars to only a handful of albums) Anyway, I like this Winwood album better than any of his others because it has melodies that flow. I thought his later albums were too choppy. I don't like songs where the vocals dominate and dictate the beat. In ""Talking Back to the Night,"" there's none of that, but rather a fine balance of instrumentation and vocals. Some of the tracks on this album are great for driving. I'm not sure why Winwood abandoned this style, but I suppose he wanted to move on and try other techniques."
2,talking back to the 80's,"this is not a real good album and i'll tell you why !!! it sounds like steve wanted to be phil collins !! now i don't dislike collins or genesis i just don't want to get my dose of that from steve winwood ... anytime steve swaps his wonderful hammond organ sound for a synthesizer you can count me out..!! the only time it even comes close to working here is on the first and last track. the stuff in the middle is something you would hear as background music in a coffee shop or elevator, or worse,,one of those terrible soft rock radio stations that's always on in the dentist office. lucky for winwood fans the 80's came and went and steve got back to making some great music."
3,Great song,"Not Steve's best work, by any means, but I think the song ""Still in the Game"" is one of his best. Why do so many people overlook this obvious gem? The disc has a couple of hits and some other interesting tunes, but overall it's only average. ""Still in the Game,"" though, deserves five stars by itself."
3,I was expecting more,"Like many others I have had it with the plastic hose reels. I decided to spend the money and get the best.while this is supperior to the plastic reels it is not great. a 100' 3/4"" hose is putting this to the test. The product was easy to put together but the performance is not the best. They should include some helfull advise with the purchase ( like do not use a 3/4 "" hose on this ree)I would have like a more heavy duty unit."
2,"Good idea, bad design","The cart is easy to assemble, the wheels roll very easy and the hose reel winds great. But, the plastic ""clamp"" that holds the reel on to the cart broke after a few uses and every time unwind or wind the hose I have to make sure the entire reel does not come off. Now I am looking for a replacement."
1,unable to use product,"I purchased this product on June 11, 2006. Despite repeated calls to the company, I cannot use this product because they haven't shipped me several pieces necessary to complete it's construction!"
2,Lots of Parts,"It's a good reel, but DO NOT BUY this product from the manufacturer unless you have a few hours to kill assembling it and enjoy cursing while you juggle screws and nuts. The directions are mediocre, and the amount of assembly required (35 ""easy steps"") is plain silly."
4,It was a good read,"Machine Dreams was a good read. I personally liked the characters and the developments for one to the next. I wish Billy would have been in the book more. Fore me it didn't get super duper interesting until about 60% on my kindle when Danner was turning 16. I liked the setting and the description of the era, especially the town and the cars. The only reason it doesn't get a five is because it was really, really slow for me in some parts."
4,An excellent source of information for those of you preparing for college,"I'm 17 and about halfway through my senior year of high school. I purchased this book in hopes of revealing some inside information about college life. I'm happy to say that it does not disappoint. ""Everything You Need To Know Before College: A Student's Survival Guide"" is very well-written and informative. Matthew Paul Turner is an excellent author who writes with real-world perspective and down-to-earth knowledge of the subject. It's both informative and entertaining at the same time. A word of warning though: this book is written from a born-again Christian perspective, so for you atheists out there, you might want to pass this one up. Also, the author went to Belmont college, which is a Christian school, so he might be a little biased or uninformed on some things. But it's all good. This book is excellent and should not be passed up."
4,Good info but a little dated,"This book has lots of good information for the student anticipating the start of college. It covers a wide range of information and has some practical tips about roommates, money management, extra-curricular activities, roommates, and more. My one complaint is that it is a bit dated, particularly in references to cultural trends, which surprised me for a book less than five years old. But the world changes rapidly now!=. This is a light-hearted book with lots of humor thrown in, which will likely appeal to its intended audience. If they took the time to update it, it could be a great book for a college-bound teen to read."
1,Kitz Cam Digital Camera Kit,"If I could give this a negative star rating I would. The photos are grainy, and the ones we took are bright red. I find this camera to be hard to use even for an adult (lots of clicking one button to get the right setting. If you want it to have high resolution, you have to click until it says LO...so you have to set it the opposite of what seems logical. I think this camera would frustrate the heck out of a kid and not want him to even take photos. Spend a little more for a ""non kid"" camera or buy a disposable for a child. This is a waste of money."
4,Perfect fit,These perfectly replaced the BMW OEM discs at a far lower cost. The maximum runout was 0.003 inches on one of the outboard faces. The second disc had only 0.001 inches of runout on both faces. The BMW specification calls for a maximum runout of 0.004 inches so both discs were within limits.Time will tell how the E-Coating paint will hold up. The OEM rotor hubs were plated.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought these from a clearance bin, thinking ""what the heck, give it a try."" Well, even the smallest amount of money is a waste. They are nothing more than poorly-fitting plastic gloves. Even the plastic gloves that come with my hair color fit better! There is absolutely nothing about these gloves that will help your hands. My aunt would have called them ""a boondoggle."" Don't buy them!"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!,"This material in this book is out of date. It does not meet the new National Standard Guidelines, nor does it meet the new AHA. I contacted the publisher of this, and never received a reply from them."
5,Still a Valuable Book,This book still contains valuable information. It is true the ACLS is outdated but the rest of the book is excellent. The questions make you think. It also does a good job of making you choose basic interventions FIRST instead of going right to the advanced stuff. This was a pitfall of many medic students in my class. I found this book helpful when taking my registry exam. At $110 bucks for registry exam it is important to be successful on the first attempt! I was. Thanks
1,Cheap book. I guess you get what you pay for.,The wording for many of these questions and answers is so vague that it makes it impossible to answer correctly. I have come across several questions that have multiple correct answers (per national protocols) yet only one is correct in the answer key.
3,Good in combo with...,"the Cherry book (if you have the Brady textbook). I bought both and between the 2 passed on the first go around. I would have given this 4 stars but there are a few questions, maybe 2 or 3 that are wrong or conflicting. When you get to them you will know. All in all, the questions in here were more like the ones on the test than the Cherry book, but I only took the test once and I know there are different versions of the Mational Registry test. I would suggest getting both early and start studying well before the test due to the enormity of the subject matter."
4,Not bad at all,"Just took the writtem test. Some of the questions were right on. Alot of questions based off of a ""paragragh"" which is unlike the National Test. Over all good help in forcing you to think like a Basic and use your ABC's first. Not up to current AHA standards as most other guides aren't either so some answers no longer correct. This book ranks up there with the blue ""Learning Express"" guide."
1,Sloppy and unprofessional!,"I am so disappointed in this book! The plot is weak and the characters I found to be a bit boring. Overall I thought this book was sloppy and unprofessional not what I expected by this self-proclaimed bestselling author! WORLDSTONE is a waste of time and good money, in this man's opinion."
2,A Disappointing Read,"As the parent of a child at a therapeutic boarding school and a fan of Ms. Szalavitz' earlier work, I had been looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the one-sided reporting and focus on ""old news."" Ms. Szalavitz' case studies are well known examples of the worst in the industry. While the horrendous programs described in the book deserve to be exposed and shut down, I fear that Ms. Szalavitz has done a disservice to the many, many fine wilderness and residential programs that truly help our troubled teens and their families. I agree with educational consultant Janyce Lastman's review of this book which may be found at www.strugglingteens.com."
1,Slanted Szalavitz,"Ms. Szalavitz's book is a one-sided, broad-brush indictment. She clearly has an axe to grind and has no problems bending truth and facts to make her point. Where are the interviews with students who have been helped, who as a result of their parents heart-breaking, but necessary intervention, are now leading productive lives?This book is the work of a misguided zealot and while Ms. Szalavitz may see herself as doing good, she is in fact prejudicing parents against what could very well be their best last resort.Ms. Szalavitz ""end justifies the means"" reporting is the true danger in getting troubled kids the help they need."
4,The Sting of the WWASP,This was a great read. Well researched and deeply troubling. I truly believe that for the parents of Paul (the boy who was sent to Paradise Cove in Samoa) there is a special place in hell.
5,Excellent Product...Excellent Service,"I am very happy to recommend the Philips MCD708. It provides an excellent sound, it is very versatile and also very attractive. I will say that the first one I received was defective. The DVD player had a defective lens so after calling Phillips and not getting much help I called J&R Electronics and right away they designed a plan for me that allowed me to keep the player while I waited for a new one to arrive. Once it arrived I placed the defective unit in the box and mailed it back to them. J & R Electronics was great and now I enjoy a fully functioning stereo system for my living room."
4,cheaply made CD,"I love this album, but I am writing to warn potential buyers and those who own it already that the CD it is burned on is poorly made.I take reasonably obsessive care of my CDs but a small scratch on the label side had caused my copy of Orblivion to skip in an endless jackhammer loop.Therefore I advise those who buy it to make a backup copy-- I sure wish I had. In the meantime I'll be hoping one of my friends has one for me to copy."
3,This album is mediocre,"Although I occasionally enjoy listening to this album, I am disappointed. There are some good parts, but what I want in an ambient album is something that I can play without having to skip tracks. There are parts of this album that really break the nice mood created elsewhere. For example, track 7 really makes me tense because there is a man talking about government conspiracies, the end of the world, and the mark of the devil. This is not something that I would listen to when going to sleep or making love, I think this album is made for people on drugs. I recomend Future Sound of London especially Lifeforms and ISDN to anyone who is looking for some consistenly good music."
3,Well....,"I bought this album after being entranced by the Orb about two years ago, but it never quite impressed me as much as the first two albums did, and I eventually sold it to a used CD store. I wish I hadn't gotten rid of it... but I still can see why I did. The production is amazing, and some tracks (namely ""Ubiquity"", ""Asylum"", ""Molten Love"", and ""Toxygene"") are wonderful, but somehow the album just doesn't ever grab you like the best Orb does. Also, the songs are around 6-7 minutes or so on average - which is awkward. They aren't long enough to truly develop into a chilled-out groove and they're too long for dance-pop. So, not horrible, but it fell short of expectations. My advice: buy it, but buy it used or cheap."
4,Lots of sounds,"My friend with good taste told me the Orb ""made all the sounds."" So I bought a few. Live 93, Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld. They were OK but I wasn't hooked, I sold em. I'm not into the sample thing too much. I'm not into the genre too much really. Too many cliches.Lot's of kids are easily amused by this kind of stuff, but most of this genre is not so good.Then I got this one and I understood what my friend meant. It's headphone music. Lots and lots of sounds. I liked it right away and it's grown on me. I like the whole thing. It's cheap too."
2,Very disappointing,"I used to love the Orb. I have Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld, UFOrb, their excellent John Peel Session and various other bits and pieces. I fondly remember times of lying down with headphones on for hours lost in another world full of colour, form and melody. What's this Orblivion effort though? It's just a collection of sounds arranged in dull formulaic patterns. It sounds like they are trying to do something different and progress, but end result is a cliche. The samples are meant to be funny, but they are forcing the joke. This is not the worst of the Orb, but it's pretty dire. The sound quality is pants as well. This record is currently residing in my local second hand record shop."
4,The Orb - 'Orblivion' (Island),"This twelve track disc is a tad better than their 'Orbvs Terrarvm' CD(see my review).For this record,the band has been stripped down to just two members,former Killing Joke roadie Alex Peterson and Andy Hughes.My prefered cuts are the first two,""Delta MK2"" and ""Ubiquity"" in which I notice in the credits for these two listed is Steve Hillage(Gong,Khan,Arzachel).Hillage must've have co-written the two songs with Peterson and Hughes.I also sort of liked ""Passing Of Time"" and the extremely far-out sounding ""72"".A good title,if you enjoy electronic music"
5,"Ahhhhh, I love this!!!!!!!!!!","Ahh, I think this is my favorite Orb album. VERY trippy, very creative, wildly swings your psyche back and forth to and fro, I'm not even sure what else to say about it that hasn't already been said.. it's perfect!!!!! Of course, like any Orb album, this CD is a story, and must be listened to from beginning to end (including the hidden track) to be appreciated! Also, it took a few listens for most of the other Orbs to grow on me... but I loved this one from the very first listen."
2,Sweet voice but no power,"My sister gave me this CD for the holidays. I'm always interested in hearing a new voice, the same as hearing any musicican with his or her instrument.At first listen, I thought Haley's voice rather sweet but without depth. By the end of the CD, I was irritated with the sounds...very one-dimensional and weak.There's little quality of real phrasing or emotion in any of the songs. And when she sings classical pieces, it falls dramatically short of the ability of any bonafide vocal instrument.I think her voice could grow into a pleasant-enough light soprano capable of Faure's ""Pie Jesu"", for example but only with a lot of training and dedication."
3,Stop with the Autotune,"The only thing really wrong with this CD is the use of Autotune pitch correction on her voice. Please engineers and producers!!! Stop fixing what is not broken! I'm sure Hayley is still is very good singer without it.On another subject, these musical arrangements are sometimes rather bland. Those complaints aside, this CD's not bad, but it certainly isn't at the top of my list of things to recommend to people."
1,Not the worst... but that's about all I can say for her.,"Hayley Westenra sounds very much like Charlotte Church. However, she isn't as good. She lacks any real sense of classical singing, and her voice is very immature. To be frank, I don't find her very talented at all. She's about a step up from Brittany Spears, but that's all I can say for her. Her voice is thin and powerless, and sometimes her high notes are actually slightly painful and harsh. If you want that same style of music, I'd go for Church or Brightman. Neither are the greatest of shakes, but they're both better than this little pipsqueak-voiced upstart."
5,Improvement,"It's so great to see how Hayley's voice has improved since her debut album. She's had singing lessons and it was worth it. Her voice is so bright, pure, sweet... WONDERFUL.I love her high notes and the way she makes everything sound peaceful."
5,great album for the music lover,"This album proves that Hayley Westenra is definetly not another teen artist, but one who is ORIGINAL and ""pure,"" as the album says it. When she sings, she produces out a unique sound that is clear and rich, yet soft. A favorite of mine is ""Never Say Goodbye"" because of it's mesmorizing tune. Another favorite is the sad ""Who Painted the Moon Black."" Pure will soon shoot straight to the top of the charts, as Hayley will."
5,wow!,"Hayley Westenra is a wonder... The song ""Wuthering Heights"" is worth the 16 dollars I spent on this CD alone... it's THAT GOOD!"
5,Almost Perfect.,"You have to hear her LIVE. The CD masks her perfect voice, and this is one of those exceptions where Live performance betters recorded music. It's still 5 Star but almost perfect since it isn't Live.x"
3,Lovely voice OVER-SHADOWED by over-the-top arrangements,"Hayley is a remarkable talent, it's too bad her producers and arrangers get in the way. From the opening track you hear her lovely voice, and just as you settle in to enjoy it you get hammered over the head with boorish arrangements: a death grip on beats 1 & 3, choirs that parody the worst 60s recordings with arrangements to match, and cliche key changes a la Barry Manilow. Like wrapping a boquet of roses in cotton candy.So give the arrangers & producers 0.5 stars and Hayley 5 stars. I hope on her next album Sir George & company find a more appropriate setting for her talent."
4,Pure Beauty,"Hayley is a very talented young lady .With A voice of an angel.This Cd has a great blend of Classical,Folk,Pop.I have both the US one and the UK special edition .Going by the Uk one by favorite tracks on the Cd are My heart and I,Bridal Ballad,Dark Waltz,and mary did you know."
5,Easy to understand,I have other books on canine genetics - but I keep going back here because it's easy to understand. A commonsense approach to teaching genetics.
2,"An OK book, but the privce SHOULD be $30","I think that this book is far more expensive than it should be. I have a copy of Leon Whitney's ""How To Breed Dogs"", published in 1972 (purchased used through Amazon for $12.00), that contains information that is very close to identical to a lot of information in this book. In addition, Whitny's book is far easier to understand & details breedings that were made that led to his conclusions.Any new information that is presented in this book is freely available on the internet. Your dollars would be better spent on ""The Mysteries of Breed Type"" or ""Born to Win - Breed to Suceed"" or Whitney's book.lexi"
5,On my must have list.,I would encourage everyone to buy and read this book. It is most diffently on my must have list.Sherri Rohm
4,Last minute purchase,"The quality of the radio was great. It fits anywhere and it looks great. However, the cost of the shipping and handling was too much. But it is a great product"
4,Great Little Mini-Stereo,"I bought this stereo to listen to music from a USB flash drive, CD or FM radio. It does them all and sounds good through the speakers or the headphone connection. It has a real remote and not the failure prone flat remote that comes with Philips mini-stereos. I use an iRiver and not an iPod so it is a little less convenient. You need a 3.5 mm stereo patch cord to connect a non-iPod to the JVC but it does work OK."
2,anemic sound,"I bought this system b/c of the raves review given by the users and the JVC brand. I was disappointed after unpacking and listening to my favorite cd. The sound quality is beyond bad. It doesn't produce full spectrum of music notes, and it even distorts the notes to a point that it's very noticeable to any untrained ears. I was playing just new age music, not even the more dynamic classical music . I can't imagine how bad it would sound with classicals.put things into perspective, I only need a compact unit in my treatment room to play for my clients during their meditation session. This unit sounds so bad that it can't even serve for this simple purpose. It's going back to walmart."
4,Teach,"This unit fit our needs wonderfully. We tried several to fit into a small cabinet in our sunroom that could play CDs as well as music from an iPod or MP3 player. Even with the limited space, we did not want to compromise on sound. Well, we were not disappointed. I read a review that stated the remote was awkward, I didn't get that, it's a remote, it works, it's smallish too, and we have no complaints about that. This is a great buy for the size and the choices it allows. We think it's the JVC speakers that help this unit sound so good. Buy it, you will not be disappointed."
2,INK HOG!,"I just purchased this printer on clearance 2 days ago. I have printed 4 letters and approximately 6 or 7 ""signs"" on glossy photo paper for my son's birthday party. I must report that I'm already out of ink! I have NEVER EVER had this problem with my old Lexmark printer. I purchased this HP because of it's low clearance price (I paid MUCH less for this brand new printer than it would of cost me to purchase 2 new ink cartridges for my older Lexmark). I've emailed HP regarding the ink cartridges, because on their website, they claim that cartridge 95 is the largest this printer can accept. If this is the case, I will promptly return this printer as I won't be able to afford to buy ink every few days when this printer is used! Otherwise, the print quality is great!"
2,Ok Printer,I reccomend you stay away. It is a very good printer but now that it is an old design the ink is VERY expensive and dries out fast if you don't use it very often.
2,Not good for labels,"I've had the HP #7850 printer for a few years. It's the second HP printer that I've had. For the most part, it works ok. The speed and the picture quality are ok. However, the biggest propblem that I have, and it's the same with the last HP printer that I bought, and that is: When you are printing labels or business cards, the printer will many times print outside of the border of the label or card stock. It is very aggravating and costly. Especially from a business perspective. Don't buy this printer for business use."
1,"Good images, TERRIBLE build quality","This thing is terrible. It almost never feeds paper correctly- nearly every time I tell the computer to print, the 7850 doesn't grab the paper, just makes a lot of noise and then stops until I press the ok button and crawl under my desk to hand feed each page to it. I thought I could deal with that, but then my papers started coming out with one corner crinkled and sometimes torn. I looked inside the printer and a tiny metal bar that keeps the paper aligned had somehow fallen out of its sockets, and there was no possible way to get it back in because the way it is designed. This morning it started printing the text crooked too. And I've only had it for about 5 months!"
4,"Fine, but thirsty, printer","I've had this printer for about a month. It's almost perfect. It has a ""fast draft"" mode that is really fast and that's good enough for stuff you want to print, read, and then toss. Its only negatives are a small paper tray and its expensive ink. It produces excellent pictures in the ""maximum dpi"" mode. Ink cartriges appear smaller than the cartriges my old HP 952 used. Who knows how much ink is actually in them, but the cartriges empty quickly."
1,Accomplishment just to get this printer to print,"To sum up this printer, it is a pain in the a**. It won't take the paper that I have loaded in, and if it does it will often get jammed. I had an assignment due for one of my classes with 20 minutes to spare, it took 15 minutes for the printer to print a complete copy. Then I discovered that some of my answers were wrong, but even though it took less than 1 minute to correct them I couldn't get the printer to print another copy in time. I would advise anyone thinking about buying this printer to avoid it, as I wouldn't even recommend it even if they were giving it out for free."
2,Serious ink hog and sick of out of paper msg when its not,"If you want good quality printing at a good price. Then this printer will suit your needs.However, I am constantly having to replace the ink. And for some reason the printer can't sense when there IS PAPER LOADED.Started feeding fine. But now I have to push along every page in or else I get an ""Out of paper"" message."
4,Some kind of masterpiece,"This is not the sort of album, or band, that you can get a handle on easily, but if you can spare some time to let this quirky, often beautiful album sink into your brain you'll be glad you did. I hate when people describe bands by referencing other bands, but here goes: Tom Waits + They Might Be Giants. dEUS somehow combine Waits' stylistic experimentation and bluesy, boozy wistfulness with TMBG's dorky, spastic pop appeal. Almost every song is a mini-production with several different parts, like Radiohead's Paranoid Android, for example. Some people might find this eclectic, ""artsy"" approach annoying and hard to get into, but if you like the way people like Beck or Tom Waits seem to switch genres every song, you'll like this."
1,Synopsis is as inaccurate as rest of book,"It has been firmly established that Chuck Mawhinney has the Marine Corps record number of confirmed kills in Vietnam at 103. As with so much of the book, inaccuracy seems to be the order of the day. I strongly recommend Inside The Crosshairs by Michael Lanning"
1,"Much hype, little snipe",I was a USMC Scout Sniper who worked the same area as Hathcock during the same time period and I am embarassed that anyone would take this book seriously. The long list of situation reports Henderson stuck in the back of this book are single person accounts by Hathcock himself. Where's the eyewitness confirmation? This book is a looser!!!
1,made for hollywood,"Sorry folks, I thought his story was nonsense, something out of Hollywood. I patrolled many of the areas he supposedly had work, and I found his account filled with inaccuracies."
4,Outstanding!,"Gunnery Sgt. Hathcock exemplifies what it means to be a true warrior. This country should be proud of the accomplishments and contributions he made in the art of sniping. Hathcock is a true American hero. Having read this book at least 5 times, I am continually amazed at the efforts he and his spotter went to to do their jobs. A fine read."
4,Not Bad,"This book is well written and explains all aspects of sniper warfare. After reading several books about the Vietnam conflict I enjoyed reading about a job not written about very often. This book is a nice change of pace and offers a unique perspective from the ""war"". My only complaint would be that the book is too ""pro-military"". Other than that, if you read many books about Vietnam, (as I do) I would recommend this book."
5,A must read millitary non-fiction... A Well done..,This is a super book about an american hero. The book was well recarched and had nice recall from hathcock. This is a book that will seam to be finished before you want it to be... A must read... The video is also good...
5,Marine Sniper,"Loved it! Great, can't put it down once you start reading. Gunny Hathcock was a true hero!"
4,Worth reading,"Interesting insight into the origins of the modern Marine sniper, especially in the era of Vietnam.This book is written more like a novel about a sniper than a formal autobiography, and at times I found it a little corny, but the story itself is engaging from a military buff's point of view...If you've ever wanted to be a sniper, this is a good book to read."
3,Should have been written better.,"I found the story of Carlos Hathcock very interesting, but did not enjoy the authors writing style. He seems to gloss over large portions of Hathcocks life in a few brief sentences. It is as if he thinks the book will be too long to tell the story correctly. I will look for more books on Hathcock, but by different authors."
5,Outstanding Book!,"This is perhaps the best book I have ever read. It is brilliantly told and gives one a real sense of actually being there. The story takes one through his life starting as a child and shows how he became such a great marksman. This book shows you how Vietnam was for the soldiers and what they had to contend with every day. It covers everything from the good times and funny events to hearing the screams of a fellow soldier being tortured.Thats what is great about this book it shows one what is happening and draws you into the moment as if you are standing right with them. You feel their pain, their ambitions, and their desires. This book has you holding on by the seat of your pants every page to the end."
5,"Gunnery Sergent Carlos N. Hathcock II, A Real American Hero","One of the greatest heroes of the Vietnam War, I'm sure their were many but this man stands apart from the crowd. I know he gave it all he had and more, truely a real sniper. He really cared that the job he did was for his country and fellow GI's, and he was the BEST at what he did! He sacrificed everyday many things we all take for granted, his family, his health, his life. When you start this book and see how this man so unselfish did his job you will come to realize he was indeed A REAL AMERICAN HERO of our time. My only regret is that I never got the opportunity to thank him or shake his hand. This man was very very special and I know he would never admit it, that is what Gunnery Sergent Carlos N. Hathcock II was."
5,Rest in Peace Gunney Hathcock,This book shows more than perhaps any other what man can endure. I hope he has now found peace.Read it in the memory of Gunney Hathcock
5,THE BEST BOOK THERE IS WAS AND EVER WILL BE,I HAVE READ THIS BOOK COUNTLESS NUMBER OF TIMES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PEOPLE WERE THINKING THAT DIDN'T GIVE IT 4 OR 5 STARS BUT IT ACOUNTED VERY DETAILED ACOUNTS AND ALL IN ALL IT WAS GREAT!!!!!!! I LOVED THIS BOOK AND TO ANYONE THAT READS THIS I HOPE YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK AS MUCH AS I DID. CARLOS PASSED AWAY AFTER BATTLING M.S. AND WILL BE REMEMBERED BY EVERYONE THAT HAS EVER READ ONE OF HIS BOOKS OR NEW HIM. WE ALL MISS YOU CARLOS SEMPER FI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,An OUTSTANDING story about a real life hero!!!!!,"As a Marine Staff Sergeant I have read this book a total of six times. There is one thing that I expect of all my Marines and that is that they read this book and learn about a legend in our Corps' history. Every Marine both young and old, former, present and future need to know the legacy. Gunny Hathcock recently passed on on 01 March of this year. Behind him he leaves a son carrying on the Hathcock name in the same manner. There are two types of people, those who have read this book and those who need to. Gunny I know that you are watching over us all, Semper Fidelis!!! SSgt Gilman"
5,Lonely hero,"If you are interested in war and the men who fought in them, this book is unbeatable. It reads fast ,while we sweat with this hero as he confronts his fears and overcomes. This is the story of a real American hero who saves the lives of many American soldiers. It is amazing that we did not embrace this method and the skills these snipers offered. I wish this man and his deeds were more known outside of Marine circles."
5,Be the best you can be!!,To all young men who want to make a difference. Life ain't easy but it is worth being good at whatever you do.
5,Great book,Very good book by a great American..I couldn't put it down. This what America should be about. Great men like this...
4,Very Good Read,Gets into the head of a sniper--not only how to shoot to kill but why and feelings while doing it.
5,An America Hero,This book is a story of one man's battle against his enemies. It tells of Carlos Hathcock's dedication to his country and his mission. He is a hero and his tale is gripping and is hard to put down once you start. Hathcock took his batttle to the Viet Cong and NVA troops and never shied away from a mission. He only returned to the States following his injuries after risking his own life to save his fellow Marines. This book tells the story of an American Hero who answered his country's call when many men ran.
4,the view,the book was full of real life action since it was actually based on a true story. The book flowed well. You could sense the chaos and desire to be at other locations. The most interesting section was when a North Vietnamese sniper was trying to kill him and failed. Well worth the time reading it.
2,Read Silent Warrior instead,"This is the original book, written about Carlos Hathcock in 1985.A second book, also written by Charles Henderson called Silent Warrior in 2000, is also about Hathcock. Some of this book is cut and pasted in the second book.This book however does not have the detail on the background on some of Hathcock's greatest kills, The Frenchman, the Apache, the North Vietnamese General, and the Chinese Colonel.It does go into more detail on the heartbreaking aftermath of what happened after Hathcock saved the lives of 7 burning Marines on an APC where he himself, by hanging around on the APC to save the others got burned over 93% of his body. His iron will and a bunch of friends kept him in the service until 1979, when he was retired as 100% disabled, due to MS that had kicked in due to his injuries.Both books are good, but given the choice of reading only one, I would read the second book rather than this one."
4,Interesting man,"I liked this one, easy reading, did dance around a little, that is move back and forth. Enjoyed reading about Carlos Hathcock, a very special man."
4,FIRST MILITARY HISTORY BOOK I EVER READ,"Great book I read it 8 years ago when I was in high school. I couldn't put it down. A few facts to chew on though it was an army sniper with the most confirmed kills in Vietnam, Sgt Albert F. Waldron III with 109 confirmed. But maybe I'm biased because I am a current US Army sniper. Although it's Gunny Hathcock that pointed me in the right direction. I owe it all to Marine Sniper:93 Confirmed Kills"
4,Interesting Book,"Really fascinating story behind an American legend. If you like military novels, precision shooting, and/or historic wartime accounts you must read this book."
1,Honor,This guy is certainly not a Carlos Hathcock. There was no story just a lot of self glorification. White Feather would not have been proud.
1,""" Great Fiction Novel ""","I have read 11 books todate on sniping and snipers. Most of which were great, but this one sounds more like a comic book. I was almost embarrassed by how arrogant and self-centered the book was.You want the truth un-masked and untarnished check out Michael Lanning's""Inside the Crosshairs"" or Joe Ward's""Dear Mom a Sniper's Vietnam""."
1,A fairly written book not worthy of the subject.,"Carlos Hathcock was a modern hero and a brave marine. In the beginning of the book the author already makes you aware that a lot of the material would be made up. I certainly didn't need to know that Carlos Hathcock wiped the grease paint from his buddy's face. The author also presumed to know what was on the mind of the enemy. He shouldn't have given the highlighted exploits at the very beginning either. That didn't give you much to look forward to in the upcoming chapters. There was, however, very detailed accounts of missions and that of the shooting matches which did make me want to read a chapter completely before putting down the book for a break. The pictures were a nice addition as well. I am not a writer but do appreciate a good book. If I weren't interested in Carlos Hathcock I doubt I would have read much of the book."
1,Poorly written; hardly worth the read.,"Not only is Henderson a mediocre writer, the book was at times laughable and boring. If it were possible to give this book a negative star rating, I'd give it a minus 5!"
5,Marine Sniper,"Marine Sniper 93 Confirmed Kills is an excellent book. Once I started reading it it was difficult to put it down. Being a former Marine, it was easy for me to relate to the story."
4,"Good characters, good story telling, good overall read","Chalres Henderson does an excellent job of combining action filled stories of the Marine sniper program and the life of Carlos Hatchcock. I was only in high school when I first read this book, about five years ago, and have reread it countless times."
5,bill/lillian call me sdjr714@aol.com its mike S.I. navy bas,hi guys give us a call haven't read your last hope to speak to you soon. how are the boys?
3,Interesting subject but not as good as it could have been,"I'd heard of Carlos Hathcock and his sniping skills for quite a while now and finally got a chance to read this book. I was disappointed in many ways, the author mentions having trimmed a 700+ page manuscript down, this book seems to still need something done to it. I wasn't expecting a how to manual on becoming a sniper, and this isn't one, but I'd like more about the subject. In this book you get a somewhat disjointed biography of what could make a very fascinating story about an amazing man but you get very little detail about almost none of his 93 confirmed kills. For the money I think the book is interesting but while some of Mr. Hathcock's victims are told about I would appreciate hearing about some of the others. I don't really care about his after VietNam years and I don't want all of the gory details of his kills but I do want to learn a little about more of his targets."
5,A HIDDEN HERO,I READ THE BOOK ONE SHOT ONE KILL AND ENJOYED THE STORIES VERY MUCH.I HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A FORMER MARINE AND KNEW MR. HATHCOCK PERSONALY.HE WAS A FINE MARINE THAT GAVE ALL HE WAS WITHOUT DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST SHOOTERS EVER IF NOT THE BEST.HIS ABILITIES WITH A RIFLE SAVED MANY SOLDIERS.
3,"Excellent song, but...","Great song, but for this price it is a rip, you could almost buy the whole album The Most Known Unkowns for this, and it is not even there best song on that Album, and definatly not in there career. I have not bought this, but just from telling you I can say I only reccomend this to serious collecters... Great album art."
5,Ten Years After - Ssssh,"Besides TYA's first album recorded in 1967, Sssh would have to be one of their best albums. Alvin's talent shows through to the max."
4,Learning German in a natural way,"Children learn langauage in bits and pieces, using what they need that works. Kontakte teaches in much the same way. It does give you rules for what you are doing, but this is always done in a context of trying to communicate.Having gone through language training where the rules were the main focus, I find this approach to be very valuable. This CD should be used with the text. It supplements it by allowing you to hear German speakers. You usually can't bring your teacher home with you so this is a handy alternative."
2,Not so good,It was not as good as I thought it would be. I have Hidden and Dangerous 2 and Hidden and Dangerous Sabre Squadron.And these games are great.But the Hidden& Dangerous Deluxe is really bad. It is hard to control the weapons and the soldiers.
5,"Great Seller, Great Product",It was a very smooth transaction. I received exactly what was advertised. The shipping was very quick and professional. I will definitely buy from this seller again. I have used the monitor for about 6 weeks and I love it. There are no problems and the USB ports on the side of the monitor function beautifully. I'm very happy with the purchase.
4,"is a good mobo but not from tigerdirect, be carefull...","in the most gaming pages reviews the mobo is good, in efect is good but thr xfx 680i LT solds from tigerdirect come with an ""NVIDIA BIOS"" no XFX BIOS, because you cant update the bios from xfx web site, the update program cant recognize the bios in the mb, xfx support can send by email the file for update CD way (DOS mode). after, you will have the XFX BIOS with the XFX logo in the startup post.I dont know why the mobo solds by tigerdirect come with this problem, i hope that tigerdirect can read this review and check for fix..the rest, is a good good mobo, for money and normal overlock...thanks and sorry by my english.. i learned by sms xD"
1,Bad design and support,"In order to save money XFX has installed inadequate northbridge cooler that overheated and cause failure. The RMA process is even worse, the replacement I got had a defective dimm slot and I had to RMA for the second time. The support staff are rude and seemingly try to make the customer out to be the cause of the defect. I strongly advise other to stay away from XFX. Tier1 MB manufacture like ASUS MSI Intel have better quality board and RMA support."
1,Dosent work!!!,"I buy mine and make all the connection but dont give video, and one of the fan connector dont work, i live inthe Dominican Republic and for send it back i have to pay 60US in my case was a very bad deal."
5,"""Wacko Magneto"" is the best album that no one knows about!","I came across this band's song ""Stop Counting"" while watching a recent episode of MTV's ""Daria."" I was blown away by the haunting guitar riffs and the hint of Chrissy Hind in the Anne Preven's powerful voice (Anne--I can't be the only one who's said that).The entire album "" Wacko Magneto"" simply rocks. Ednaswap mixes 70's rock, 80's punk and 90's alternative to create a unique but familar sound that is hard-edged and gritty.Much to my joy and surprise, Ednaswap originally wrote and sang that Natalie Imbruglio hit, ""Torn."" Compared to the airy, soft-rock/pop version that Imbruglio did, Ednaswap's version is raw, honest and earnest. You have to hear this version--there is no comparison.I highly recommend this album."
1,"The Howard Stern show reeled me in, but it was not too great","I can listen to ""torn"" over and over, but the rest of the songs on the album are not too good. They sound like songs from the 1980's. The music was hard to listen to. However, if you like ""Torn"", the album may be worth it. Certainly better than Imbruglia's version."
4,had your bluff called?,"This movie was rather amusing, and I enjoyed the music very much. It was interesting to note the way in which Bollywood is using Westernized ways of music or movie-making while imbuing them with a quintessentially Indian flavor. Good job, guys."
5,"Brilliant, funny, wild stories","This is one of those books that everyone is talking about. I read a review in the New York Times that was full of the wildest, most glowing praise. And then I read the book! It deserves every wonderful thing everyone has said about it. Adam Johnson manages to combine gripping storytelling, laugh-out-loud humor, genuine insight into human life, brilliant social satire, and amazing invention.These stories are such a pleasure to read that you don't realize until afterward how much they get you to think, and how they subtly change your view of reality. Do you think you know what our life right now is like? Read this and you will. Adam Johnson is the real thing. I look forward to his next book!"
5,Adam Johonson is the man,"These stories are incantatory. ""Trauma Plate"" alone is worth the price of admision. The future is scary but unusually sweet. Adam Johnson is a genius. The big guy is onto something. Buy several copies and keep one in Mylar. We've read these stories three or four times and find something new each time."
3,Emporium,I read a story and started another only to decide not to go on. Adam Johnson is really a talented author but this work did not appeal to me.
5,Creative and Visual,"I was introduced to Adam Johnson through his first novel ""Parasites Like Us"" which was a captivating read. ""Emporium"" did not dissappoint. Quick reads yet captivating."
2,same essential story repeated nine times,"If you read just one of these it may seem fresh and quirky, but the same immature first-person narrator coping with various gimmickry wearied me by the third piece. The rest is just more of the same. Merely ""clever"" at best."
4,Valuable source of information.,"This book deals exclusively with the health aspects of Chi Kung. This book has a complete set of drawings demonstrating where the energy meridians occur on the human body, but unfortunately this book doesn't teach how to direct Chi along the meridians to clear blockages. This book has pictures that adequately teach a series of exercizes that will improve your health."
3,Tricky at his Lowest,"I cannot understand how can ""Pre-Millenium Tension"" be considered one of the best albums of the 1990's, while "" Maxinquaye"", ""Nearly God"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces"" are great masterpieces. This record is good, very impenetrable at the beginning, but it simply doesn't reach the level of Tricky's creative genious. It's not about being impenetrable or not (after all, I have a lot of impenetrable records. It's more about what confusing this album is. Nevertheles, ""Pre-Millenium Tension"" has very strong points. ""Christiansands"", ""Tricky Kid"", ""Bad Dream"" and ""Piano"" are songs that show that Tricky's masterfulness was not lost. ""Pre-Millenium Tension"" would be an excellent record if it was Tricky's debut. But, at least, it's good to know that he learned about his mistakes."
3,"intriguing, but repetitive loops","The hype I read on this ablum implied a chaotic, anti-pop style, something both exciting and challenging. Though not a bad recording, it fell short of my hopes. It's true, some of the mixes are inventive and peculiar, but Tricky never varies from the initial loops. Once you've entered a song, there's nowhere to go. No matter how odd the initial impact, the sound is commonplace after four minutes. There are several bright spots on the disc, but it is not the revolutionary sound I long for."
2,repetitive,"Most of the trax on this album are to slow, dull, and repetiitve to hold the attention of anyone whose not on drugs. Maxinquae is a better album."
2,How can THIS be one of the best albums of the 90's???,"Let's get one thing straight - ""Hell is Around the Corner"" RULES.OK. Now that this is settled, it is safe for me to say that nothig on this album is even close to as powerful, haunting, or even likeable as that song. I am a HUGE alternative, trip-hop, and elektronica fan - but this album just isn't that great. TRUST ME. The only song that I listen to is ""Vent"". That song is pretty cool because it has interesting industrial beats and doesn't have too much rapping (which is what I don't like about Tricky) in it. Anyhow, too many of the songs just aren't interesting enough to hear several times. Check out ""Maxinquaye"". There are many great catchy songs on it. I still have faith in the greatest trip-hop group ever - PORTISHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!rating:C-"
2,"What have you done, Tricky?","I have to admit that ""Vent"" is cool because I have grown fond of those industrial beats and I like the background music to ""Sex Drive"" - but other than that, this album has nothing to offer....Talk about falling from grace... ""Maxinquaye,"" along with ""Dummy,"" is the best trip-hop debut album ever. ""Pre-Millennium Tension"" does not even come close to Tricky's previous record.Even avid Tricky fans should avoid this one."
4,Smoke the groove,"Tricky and Martina lock themselves into a broom closet with a twenty sack of dro, a couple of late '80s hip hop 12 iches and a metal guitarist and out came this disturbing musical mess. Ghetto Youth seems to threaten a lot of white boys with the patois heavy sermonizing but Christiansands and makes me wanna die give the DMX/REM axis something MTV suitable. Bong hits accentuate the industrial jungle .This sound is blacker and more powerful than Oprah."
5,"How ""Ghetto Youth"" fits into the trip-hop masterpiece","Over time, every track here has revealed itself to be completely brilliant. I see that Ghetto Youth is getting a lot of hate, and I can understand it, but looking at the vinyl track list explains a lot to me. Tracks 1-5 work together as a unified whole, and Ghetto Youth trails off during the remaining time on side A. Sex Drive then starts side B with a burst of fresh energy. Whether or not he was aware that some people would skip it is unclear, but it fills a transitional space. In the dark wasteland between the two sides of this trip-hop masterpiece, you will find ""Ghetto Youth."""
4,"Dark, brooding beats brought to you by Tricky","After going in a different creative direction with his sophmore release 'Nearly God', Tricky gave us more of a sound similiar to his debut album 'Maxinquaye' with his third full length album ""Pre-Millenium Tension"". The album is actually a fusion of rock, reggae, punk, and hip-hop including a nod to some of his influences with two covers of Old School Hip-Hop songs ('Bad Dream' by Chill Rob G. and 'Lyrics of Fury' by Eric B. and Rakim) both performed by female vocalists. In doing so, and within many of his tracks, he blends elements of varying types of music, and uses his lyrics to create a much more ambiguous and blurry reality of sexuality. Popular singles include ""Christiansands"" and ""Tricky Kid"""
1,quit all that squawking!,"This album is a DUD and YOU KNOW IT!It's not a great album.There's nothing worse than spending your money on a full length album that's pnly got one or two good songs on it.Pre-Millenium is intense, personal, disquieting, introspective....and I'm sure Tricky got a lot of therapeutic value out of recording this, but it's NO FUN to listen to!! I also bought it on the beauty of 'Christiansands' and was let down by how jarring and bleak everything else was. If you find Shostakovitch to be too peppy for your tastes, then this album would be your cup of tea...Because, let's face it folks- if mega-star Tricky can get this depressed, than what's the point of you trying to keep a smile on your face as your trudge through your pathetic, work-a-day life?For those of you who... want to listen to similar music that's actually enjoyable...may I suggest anything by DJ Wally, Rhythm + Sound w/ Tikiman, Wagonchrist and Joy Division."
1,"Get ""Maxinquaye"" and perhaps ""Nearly God""...","... That's all that you REALLY need from Tricky. This album has nothing. The songs are terrible. ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" at least has ""Broken Homes"" on it - which is excellent.THIS IS HIS WORST ATTEMPT THUS FAR."
1,"Can anybody understand ""Ghetto Youth?""",I hate music that I can't understand. Tricky babbles on and on and never stops. If anybody has any idea why there is so much rap on this or why Tricky's lyrics are in no way comprehendible - please write a review and let me know.
5,Rispek Juu,This is the kind of creative expression that confirms my belief that human beings are divine. Nuff Rispek!
4,The Pirate's Daughter does make you want to get to the end...,"I thought this book was very interesting. I don't know a lot about Jamaica's history, but by building a story around it's history and involving Errol Flynn did make it an interesting read."
4,It hot but hush!!!!,"From the point of view of a Jamaican,especially one of my generation,this is a painful book to read.Cezair-Thompson has got the atmosphere right.The resonances are agonisingly accurate,and the dialogue reflects the way we 'talk'.The sense of ""Paradise Lost"" brings tears to the eyes,and the lost opportunities she depicts strenghten the sense of guilt that the average non-political Jamaican feels today.The brutal violence that almost characterizes Jamaica today,and the love that we feel for this superbly beautiful ""Rock"", create a schizophrenia which has become a normal part of the Jamaican experience.The negatives: Is there no hope for us ? Is there balm in Gilead?"
5,wicked!,"This book is the real deal, a dead-on blend of contemporary and historical Jamaica presented through the eyes of a fascinating family of memorable characters. TTHOP is celebration and lament, an aching longing for home and homeland that is never quite soothed. A classic."
5,Good Buy,The item delivered in good condition. The small size make it quite handy when doing testing. Don't know how many scratch it can last because i am not using for acid test but to calibrate my AuRacle gold tester. 5 stars only on the item delivered.
1,Terrible product,"The product malfunctioned right out of the box. Very erratic starts and stops..., trickle of crushed pepper..., intermittent operation..., absolute waste... thanks to Amazon's return policy, was able to get my money back."
1,Piece of junk,"This pepper mill is a nothing but a piece of junk. I ordered two of them. The motor on the first one died within 10 seconds of putting the batteries in. On the second one, the motor is ""working"", but it is not turning the metal rod, so all you get is the motor noise and no grinds. The motor has all plastic, fine teeth gears - even if you get lucky and get it to grind a teaspoon before it dies, how long do you think that's going to last? Don't throw your money away on this bottom of the barrel ""made in china"" junk."
1,Did not work out of the box,"I first opened and the thing does not work right out of the box. Tried different batteries and n othing, no sounds, nothing. Maybe mine was just bad luck but..."
1,Not reliable,"I received this item for Christmas, and at first I thought it was wonderful. Then I was in the just finishing up the last of the seasoning, before serving and no pepper. This unit is unreliable sometimes it grinds just fine, other times nothing. I don't know if it was defective or a poor design. If you took it apart and put the batteries back in then it would work. Having to fix a pepper grinder in the middle of cooking wasn't acceptable."
1,no good,"This was a replacement they sent for 3 other replacements.When inverted it grinds one teaspoon of pepper then stops.I called to ask if it's supposed to be a measured dose?""no"".The only time it did a great job was when it accidentally got knocked off the table:I traced a whining noise to a chair...the pepper mill was upside down and the chair was full of pepper...LOTS and LOTS of pepper."
1,not worth it,"I bought 2 of these for a set of salt and pepper. After putting in all the batteries I tried it out and the sea salt poured out w/o grinding at all. The mechanism to adjust the grind did not work. The other one wouldn't grind at all no matter which adjustment I tried. Very disappointing after reading about all the happy customers prior to purchasing. However, I am always pleased with Amazon's easy return policy of free returns--no questions!"
3,Not the same old grind,Well made. this product uses too many battteries. Also it should only work when turned upside down. It starts when turned sideways. Also should have a larger reserve for pepper and the grind size is too big even when adjusted
4,Pepper grinder,"I adore this product..what a great invention. No more grinding the pepper mill...just turn the pepper grinder over and you have pepper! You can adjust the top to get the desired size of pepper you wish. This is my third one I have purchased. One of them froze up and I think it was my fault as I would turn it over when cooking and the steam ruined it. My new one works great except the bottom doesn't want to stay on very good and it makes the batteries clunk if it is not on tight. I am afraid that will strip the gears. I took the bottom off the old one before I threw it away and now it works better. When my friends saw mine, they purchased this grinder as well."
2,electric pepper mill,We were looking to use these as Holiday gifts this year. They were not as nice as we had hoped. I am leaving them in their original packaging so we don't know if they work (we certainly hope they do). The overall product looks cheaper in reality than in the picture.
4,Excellent Pepper Mill!,"I have owned and used several pepper mills over the past years. This has to be the finest one that I have had, bar none!"
3,Pepper mill,"Purchased this mill to be used as a salt mill as I already had one used just for pepper. Both mills grind in too large a ""grain"" for my taste so am using the mills strictly for cooking not tabletop."
2,so-so grinder,"This grinder I purchased to replace the best grinder I've had (batteries corroded) but they no longer make. This grinder worked great until it became time to replenish the pepper --- the unit did not want to open up. I have ordered a different brand from amazon today and when I get the new one I will put a wrench on this old one to see if I can open it without breaking it. Also the plastic has become sticky. Since this unit starts to grind when inverted, it is difficult to do a routine battery replacement -- I recommend getting a mill that has a button to turn it on."
3,didn't meet my expectations,"the grinder does grind automatically, however the grind is extremely coarse and the grinder is almost impossible to adjust. the container is only the size of the clear area so very small"
1,Never worked,"Bought two, added batteries and both motors worked but nothing came out. Called the company they said take it apart and use a paper clip to clean out both grinders. Put it all back together and this time a small amount came out then nothing. Sending both back today."
1,plastic chips breaking away inside,"We received one as a gift several years back - first annoyance was that the cap turns the wrong way to unlock and access the batteries - and this needs to be done often, to clean the contacts and to refill the limited pepper supply - now plastic chips have broken away inside on the part of the clear plastic container which is supposed to lock into the housing and not rotate - so the thing no longer grinds, and we are left wondering how much ground plastic we have eaten. We would not buy another of this design.Addendum - the nice folks at consumersusa@trudeaucorp.com replaced our defective ""Graviti"" with a ""Melosa"", which appears not subject to the design/material flaw of the Graviti"
1,Worked great at first.,"We bought one pepper mill and liked it so much we bought another one. They were easy to use and did a great job. I particularly liked the ability to adjust the coarseness of the grind. The only problem at first was that the bottom would not stay on, which meant they wouldn't operate; we sort of solved that with some masking tape inside to add friction BUT THEN...after about 4 months they each broke - neither one will grind pepper (or salt). Unfortunately the ""return window"" was expired so we're out about $60 for these mills. Very disappointed."
5,In love with a pepper grinder,"My friend showed me the Trudeau Graviti pepper mill as though it was a gag gift. After using his for just a minute's time, I knew I had to have one. I love it so much, it has become my standby gift for anyone who does not already have one. The fact that it runs on 6 AAA batteries is a pain, but that is a minor complaint compared to the joy of one-handed pepper grinding."
2,Bad design,"The intended use of the product is good. But, the design is very poorly done. I'm on my third (and last) one of these. Drive motor is very unreliable. The assembly relies upon several very small plastic bumps to secure the assembly. If these break (and they definitely will) it's useless. Think very carefully about buying this one unitl the design problems are fixed."
2,Power problem,I bought a previous edition of this mill. I hope the current product is better. Mine worked for a while but now is performing badly due to being underpowered even with fresh batteries.
5,excellent not a waste of money,If you love ground pepper you will love this especially if you have any wrist or hand pain.Works great !!!!
2,great but short life,"bought this after many years with a pampered chef one handed grinder and salt shaker. based on other reviews i thought it was a good piece of equipment and really liked it. even considered getting another one for salt. but after 5 months of moderate use, it quit grinding. motor works but grinding shaft only turns intermittently. tried everything...very disappointed."
5,THE best peppermill,"Our first Trudeau mill was a gift from friends. I have since gifted them to others and bought another so that I have one at both homes. I am not a big fan of battery operated devices at the dining table, but I make an exception for this one. You can't go wrong having this mill in your kitchen!"
2,doesn't work - will return,Will have to send back as the grinder rod inside does not go around. I feel sure Amazon will send me another one.
4,Battery operated salt shaker,"I have had other types of Trudeau B.O. salt shakers and loved them but liked the three I just bought because of the colors and because I was familiar with Trudeau. These you do not have to shake, just turn upside down (how lazy can we get?) and that part works great. The disadvantage and the only reason I did not give 5 stars was because they do not hold as much as the other ones I have and they are terribly hard for an old person to unscrew. They unscrew on the bottom and it took me forever to get the stainless steel one open. However, even with those negatives I would still recommend them highly."
1,This is a POS,It does not grind pepper. It spins it. The exit clogs up. The bottom pops off. This is a waste of time and effort
3,no peppercorns!,I ordered two Graviti Battery operated pepper mills which I was going to use for Christmas gifts. When I went to wrap them a couple days before christmas one had the peppercorns in it and one did not. It was too late to return them so I purchased peppercorns to include with the one without. I feel I should be reimbursed for the peppercorns. As for liking the product - I have one and love it! That was why I ordered for my kids.
4,fun and easy,The pepper mill is going to make great fun Christmas gifts for our grown kids who have everything. Bet they don't have this. Kept one for us and love it.
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this because my husband has the use of only one hand and thought this would be perfect for him. NOT! sometimes it grinds, and when it does it comes out in all sizes, no matter on what size grind you set it. It will only work for a few seconds and then quit."
4,Easy grind,This is a fun peppermill. All you do is turn it upside down and listen to the motor whirr as it drops the ground pepper on your food. Only drawback is there's only one grind - no adjustment for coarse or extra fine grinds.
2,Only Lasted 18 Months,"Worked good for first 12 months, during the last six months it has gradually stopped altogether. It's not a battery problem, always have plenty on hand.Don't expect much more than 12 months of effective use."
4,Great Pepper Mill,"Bought two of the Trudeau Graviti mills - one for salt and one for pepper. Was a bit skeptical at first if they would work as advertised - and they do. Just put in batteries, fill the mill - turn it over and it grinds perfectly. Other peppermills I have had have the grinder on the bottom and they always left a ness on the table top. No more mess with this unit! The reservoir for the peppercorns could be a little larger - but except for that, this is a great product."
5,"If you love pepper, you need this","I don't know how I lived without this. I love how easy it is to use, simply turn it over and it starts to grind. This is my second grinder I have purchased, I am going to use this one for salt. One thing to know, keep some extra AAA batteries around. This takes 6 batteries and I tend to replace them every few months, but I also give this grinder lots of heavy use."
1,Don't waste your money or time,"I purchased this to replace an automatic which I loved but had worn out. The Trudeau holds very little, gives an uneven grind and, after the third refill totally broke down. The motor turned but nothing happened. No peppercorns stuck anywhere, but the stem would not turn even when empty. I finally removed the batteries and threw it away. By the way, three different people worked on it to no avail so I know it was not me. For right now I am back with the good old reliable hand mill."
5,Electric Pepper Mill,We love this product. A friend had brought us one from Oregon several years ago. We have bought about 5 since for gifts.
1,Poor Quality compared to the Pepper Mill I bought years ago.,"The first one I purchased was great and lasted about 4 years. I got a replacement over the summer and it stopped working in three weeks.Since I still had the old one, I compared it to the new one. The new Pepper Mills have more plastic and the parts don't fit together as tightly.Basically someone in accounting did some cost cutting and these devices aren't made to last any more.They are more affordable now."
4,Fine grinds the easy way,"This is a real wrist saver because you no longer have to twist or shake to get your finely ground pepper. Turn it upside down and watch the pepper sift onto your food. But make sure you use only high quality peppercorns (the ones with rough surfaces), because the cheap stuff can get stuck in the mechanism and cause it to slip. If this happens, use the point of a knife to dig out the casings from the shaft attachment on the battery pack. Get good stuff and it will work again just fine."
3,"Handy, but not perfect","This is a handy product, but it has a few problems:Pros.1. Works well and is highly adjustable.2. I like a lot of pepper. It would sometimes take me a couple of minutes to grind with a manual grinder what I can now grind in seconds.Cons.1. Grinder stem contains a spring that is easily dislodged. It ends up in the peppercorns if you aren't very careful when refilling. Also, if you accidentally overfill it, the spring will fall out when you empty the excess peppercorns and you will have to get a tool to reinstall it. It's not a huge problem but is mildly annoying.2. Sounds like an electric pencil sharpener. The motor is a bit loud.A rechargable model might be better. I used Duracell batteries and the required 6 AAA batteries lasted three months. I use it rather intensely 5 days a week, so your mileage may vary."
1,Exploded inside - never worked correctly,"I could never get it to work right. 5 mins trying and the grinder sounded like it was having a tough time grinding the peppercorns and then it exploded inside. The grease or whatever came out into the mill. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I will be returning and looking at more expensive ones. This one seemed cheaply made."
1,Do not buy.,This product is garbadge. Do not buy. I waisted my money. If I didn't throw away my receipt I would have sent it back. This is the second worst product I 've ever purchase out of 100 plus items. I am a loyal customer of Amazon and I know that they are good business people. I just won't purchase from that seller again. Just remember read all feedback before purchasing an item from amazon. I learned my lesson well.
5,graviti battery pepper mill,The Trydeau Graviti pepper mill is the best I have ever used. Just tip it and you have instant pepper and flavor. I had gotten one as a gift and liked it so much I bought 4 of them as gifts for my family. Have to be careful putting new pepper corns in but its not too difficult. Highly reccomend every home has one.
2,Didn't last...,"We loved it but it stopped working within the first month. Now it noisily grinds air when full of peppercorns. Great concept, shoddy workmanship."
4,Love It!,"This is my second grinder. I found the first at Marshall's Superstore and bought it because of price (cheap) and it ran on batteries. I had it for over 4+ years. Have purchased a second, which is much sleeker in design and like it much better. I have bought the grinder as a housewarming gift and this year will as x-mas gifts for my 2 foodie friends."
2,Looks great but impossible to put together,I rarely write bad reviews but this product didn't leave to it's description. No one in my family could figure out how to install batteries easily without brutal force and mess afterwords.
3,Great for about 6 months then.....,We were very excited to receive this for a Christmas gift last year so much that we ordered 4 more immediately. We were disappointed when it began to fail after 6 months of use. Then we were a little embarrassed when we heard that a couple of the ones we had given away began to stop working as well. We loved the concept & I am ordering another electric mill but not the same brand. I'm being a little cautious on the selection this time. Still a great concept & we enjoyed it for the time it worked.
2,Product only works part of the time...,"I purchased 2 of these Graviti Pepper mills for my parents - they both arrived w/pepper in them so my father took the pepper out of one of them and put rock salt in it - the salt mill works greats but the pepper mills, the pepper corns get stuck and when they get stuck, it will not dispense pepper. My father got so frustrated w/it he ended up putting plain pepper in it and now the pepper comes out way to fast...."
5,Great product,"I bought this for a Christmas gift for a friend; however, I tried it out to make sure it worked properly. She is going to love it. Great product at a good value."
1,It stopped working. I put new batteries in and now I can not even open it,This product has stopped working. I put new batteries in. now i can't get the case open . Please send me a replacement in red. I will send this one back. let me know.
1,"Did not work, even using tips from other reviews","I was hesitant about ordering this pepper mill based on some of the reviews, but some said it was fantastic so I gave it a go.I could not get it to work, at all, even using hints and tips from other reviewers. I spent too much time trying to get it functional, and did not succeed.Back into the box it goes. Mine was a dud. If you choose to order it, I hope you are more successful than I was."
2,Didn't work,"I really wanted this to work. I liked the design and concept and found the price reasonable. However, after putting in new batteries and using it according to the directions it hardly worked. It would do a weak little partial grind then stop. Tipping it again would sometime produce the same results and sometimes nothing would happen at all. I am returning it, and the search for a peppermill I can use with one hand while stirring or handling raw poultry with the other continues."
3,Great concept; not strong enough.,"I was kind of concerned when I ordered this because it seemed like a lot of people had problems with it. When we first tried it out we had problems getting it to work. Finally I figured out that the drive shaft was slipping in the grinding burrs, so then I pushed on the ""bottom"" while grinding and the added pressure kept the shaft driving the burrs and it worked pretty well. I'm thinking that I will insert some heavy paper ""washers"" inside the ""lid"" (on the bottom) and see if that will tighten the thing up. Like so many products engineered in one place and built in another, I guess the product developers don't get a chance to see how well what they've designed actually works, or how well they're being manufactured. It also seems to give a pretty coarse grind, which is o.k with me because I don't mind a coarse grind. At any rate, it seems to me like there's room in the market for a better quality grinder than this thing."
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,"The mill is difficult to adjust....still working on it. Can't find the right setting for medium or fine. All settings seem to produce very chunky grind some combined with fine, some all very chunky. I am disappointed since I have wanted this mill for over a year and finally bought it. Of course my husband couldn't resist saying it was a piece of junk."
2,Stopped Working in a cuple months,"I bought this as a replacement for the exact same pepper mill. It worked about half the time, always struggling to grind my Costco Tellicherry peppercorns. A few days ago it quit working altogether. The motor grinds, but nothing happens. Boo, hiss!"
3,fists of fury,this dvd is ok but only if they can restore them bruce lee movies with better clerer picture you now like time life movies
4,Lee's first movie.,"Whe this film was released here it's title was switched from THE BIG BOSS to FISTS OF FURY, and the movie FISTS OF FURY was re-named THE CHINESE CONNECTION. Got that! Lee plays a nice country guy who works at a ice factory run by a evil gangster called the big boss (Han Ying Chieh). The action scenes are well done and the dubbing is some of the worst.Note: only buy the BRUCE LEE: THE MASTER COLLECTION dvd from Fox Home Video.1972. Columbia. ??? MINS.Rated R (Violence advisory)."
1,This DVD is horrible,"This is not the Columbia DVD. That one is wonderful. This DVD looks like a very old VHS tape, one that was kept in the sun for years. Its that bad. If you want Fist of Fury, pay a little more for the Columbia version."
1,this sucked!,"there is nothing about this dvd that was any good. it seemed to be a bad reproduction of a bad reproduction of a really good movie. the audio was off and awful, the resolution... welll it just sucked. save your money. get the bruce lee collection instead. this was a waste of money and time."
3,BRUCE MAKES HIS STARRING DEBUT,"IN THIS ONE, BRUCE LEE PLAYS A MAN WHO WORKS AT AN ICE FACTORY. SOON, FAMILY MEMBERS BEGIN TO DISSAPEAR AND HE LATER FINDS OUT THAT HIS BOSS IS A DRUG PUSHER. OK MOVIE, BUT IT'S JUST NOT AS POWERFUL AS HIS LATER FILMS WOULD GO ON TO BE. THE LAST 20 MINUTES OF THE FILM ARE FANTASTIC, THEY REALLY SHOWCASE LEE'S UNCANNY ABILITIES. THE DUBBING'S NOT AS BAD AS PEOPLE SAY IT IS, BUT THIS MOVIE ISN'T ALL THAT WHEN IT COMES TO BEIN COMPARED TO BRUCE'S OTHER MOVIES. BUT STILL, IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE LEGENDARY BRUCE LEE, THIS MOVIE IS GAURANTEED TO BRING YOU ENTERTAINMENT FOR A LONG TIME."
2,not what I expected,"People have told me that Fist of Fury was Bruce Lee's first and best film. I don't see how that is. First of all, there was not very much martial arts in this movie to begin with. Secondly, I know that a good bit of martial arts films don't focus much on good story plots but this movie really suffered from not having a good plot. I have seen better Bruce Lee films."
3,A badly made film with Bruce Lee,Fist of Fury is basically your average Martial Arts film. It's badly made with a cory plot and shallow characters. The one thing that stands out about the film is Bruce Lee. Just getting to seem him fight makes sitting through all the awful dialogue and boring scenes worth it.
5,a timeless movie with a timeless actor,not only was Bruce good at martial arts but he was great at helping out with scenes in alot of the movies he starred inhe will be in our hearts forevergreat movie this is. have it on dvd. watched it 8 times already. lives up to its name. it really is a fists of fury movie. deep moving plot and storyline. great cast of characters. you can get a few laughs in this movie and a few shocks too due to some of the violence. but this is a great movie and I'd recommend it to any B.L. fan. a great role for him to play in his first movie.
1,do not buy this DVD,Please do not buy this poor quality dvd. You will be wasting your time and money...
3,Furious Fists,"Bruce Lee's first movie is also one of his best. The film is about a young man named Cheng (Lee) who moves to Bangkok to live with his cousins and work in an ice factory. But, he when his cousins start disappearing, he finds out that his corrupt employers are involved.The fight scenes are brilliantly choreographed and the simple story is complemented by the many brilliant battles. The final fight between Lee and the Boss is unforgettable."
2,"Great Movie, Poor Quality DVD","While this is a great film, this DVD edition has picture quality too poor to do it justice."
1,Unwatchable dvd transfer from VHS tape,"This dvd is terrible quality, it has lots of terrible analog flaws, like the vhs tape that it was copied from kept losing tracking wiping out the main fight scenes, and the whole movie is squashed horizontally, and distorted. The color is way off like the vhs tape was rented for years before being copied onto the dvd. It is unwatchable! Do not buy this dvd or any dvd from this Candian company."
1,Don't even think of buying this DVD,"Interesting film, but terrible transfer - full screen, no language/subtitle options, grainy transfer from video tape complete with interference where the tape was worn (including most of the famous fight scenes). There's a real collection coming out: get that instead."
3,Bruce Lee's first starring role,"The movie is pretty cheesy. I was hoping for a little more fighting scenes given the fact Lee is in it. The fighting that does occur isn't coreographed all that great.Since this is Lee's first movie with him as the main character I should cut it some slack, but I'm not.For the casual Bruce Lee fan I'd say this movie can be skipped."
2,ALWAYS stay with ORIGINAL,"Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though."
1,Unwatchable dvd transfer from VHS tape,"This dvd is terrible quality, it has lots of terrible analog flaws, like the vhs tape that it was copied from kept losing tracking wiping out the main fight scenes, and the whole movie is squashed horizontally, and distorted. The color is way off like the vhs tape was rented for years before being copied onto the dvd. It is unwatchable! Do not buy this tape or any tape from this Candian company."
4,Actually an interesting film,"I'd say this is one of Lee's best. Sure the production values are not what we are used to, almost more like a student film than an action movie. But the story is actually - dare I say it? - deep. It's about the plight of the outsider, in this case immigrant Chinese laborers, in a society without the rule of law. Stuff to think about for us happy Americans with our lawyers and ACLU and legal trade unions and - hey - elections. The interesting thing about this movie is that it ISNT some cheesy flic about private islands and crazed monastics and secret societies. The hero of this film, though he'd do pretty well on a private island run by crazed monastics, has NO CHANCE as an immigrant laborer in modern Thailand. He wins the final battle, but he still loses in the end."
1,Just say No!,"Do not, I repeat, do NOT buy this DVD! If you are a fan of Bruce Lee, and/or of quality DVDs, you will hate yourself for buying this junk. I knew when I bought this edition that it was cheap and was probably not going to have the best picture quality. But halfway through watching one of these fine Bruce Lee classics put out by Goodtimes (yuck), I noticed an ever-so-faint logo ""GT"" in the corner of the picture. As if they created these classics!! I do not pay good money (or even ($)) on a dvd so I can watch a 90-minute advertisement for some company that had nothing whatsoever to do with creation of the film. It's bad enough that television channels cover 1/4 of the screen with their logos, now this pissant DVD printer wants you to look at their logo all through viewing a movie. Aaaugh!!"
5,In my mind Bruce Lee's Greatest movie,"Bruce Lee plays the role of a young man sent to live with his cousins t work. After his cousins come up missing, and trouble finds him more and more he realizes it's much more complicated then he'd ever imagined. Some of Bruce Lee's greatest On Scene fight scenes are showcased in this film. Watch Bruce fight his way through an ice factory, and the backstreets of china untill his final showdown with the man behind it all. The end fight is worth the whole movie, but it's not cause the rest of the movie is average. It's a classic movie with an unforgetabe final fight sequence."
4,Great read,"Really enjoyed this book. A little slow about 1/3 of the way through I lost some interest. Not sure if it was me or the book. I picked it up again however, and am glad I did. Turned out to be a nice ending."
5,good book,It was a very good book. It kept my attention and I wanted to keep reading till the end. I recommend it.
4,Good Catholic Suspense Novel,"This book was well written, but it was a slow starter. I enjoyed the book when considering it now that I have read the whole thing, but I took a break from this book for a couple of weeks, as I was 60% through it and it still had not captured my full attention. Once I went back to the book, I finished it quite quickly and actually enjoyed it."
2,Tried twice to read it.,"This book may have been good, but I tried to read it twice and could not get past the first couple of chapters. I did not know this was ""young adult"", or I would not have bothered. I'm really not interested in any type of ""romantic"" fiction that involves an 18-year-old."
2,Skip it!,"Not very well written. Very predictable. Unlikeable characters. The relationships developed by the characters are hasty and unbelievable. By the end of the book, I wanted to slap some sense into every character in the book. I wanted to abandon the book from the beginning, but that's very hard for me to do....I wish I had."
2,"Ok, not great","I wonder at the label of CHRISTIAN Romantic suspense. Religion did not really play a part in this book. Not a great book, took me a bit to get into it. Would not choose it again."
1,Would not recommend,Way too predictable. It did keep me reading to find out if I was right but there were many unrealistic situations happening back to back.
3,"Pictures as fuzzy as my memory, unfortunately!","I would certainly give this book a 5-star recommendation for content, but unfortunately the smudgy, indecipherable details in many of the photos lets it down. This is strange, considering the comparatively excellent picture quality of the Girls' Toys of the Fifties and Sixties companion volume. I'm not sure why this difference exists, as the pictures for both volumes were all taken from the same original catalogs.That being said, however, this is still a tour worth taking. The type is clear and easy-to-read, and it's a fascinating look into how we played when we were young. I only hope if this volume is ever re-issued, the flaws in the picture quality here get repaired."
5,Terrific! brought back lots of memories! Great Reference,"Great source for collectors or toy dealers.. Many times we find toys and aren't sure of the exact year it was made or what company manufactured it. This is a great source to find that info, and it is very entertaining to see all those toys we grew up with! TimeWarp Toys"
5,Great belt!,"Love this belt, and don't have any complaints. every pocket is very intuative. the belt goes tight enough for me with a 34 waist. the material is extremely durable. the Pockets hold a lot!"
5,Worth every penny!,"This tool belt is well constructed, designed, and usable regardless if your a pro or weekend handyman. I have been using this belt for almost 3 months now while building my deck and shed. This belt has taken a beating and given me no issues. My only regret is I did not by any suspenders, but its on my list. If you quality and dependability get this belt."
4,Descent tool belt,"I am a professional building contractor, and I purchased this belt about 3 years ago, and was really inpressed for the price. The bags are a bit bulky, but seemed to work well. The material isn't quite as heavy as on other set-ups, but not bad. I had used this belt for about a year on mostly residential work and it held up pretty well, but after about a year on a commercial project the bags are a bit torn up. I have a clc set that I often use that is made of more durable material and has held up to use for about five years with very little damage to the bags. This set-up is still a real good set though, especially for the price. Hard to go wrong with it."
5,Almost Perfect,"I do construction full time, and this is the nicest belt I have found. It isnt even expensive. It has more decent sized nail pockets than any others. Doing remodel work I often need to carry around a few different kinds of fasteners, so it is nice to have the extra pockets. The one thing I would change about it is that it doesnt have any pencil holders on the big bags, just on the tape holder. I had mine stolen while working on an apartment building, and I have used my old belt for a couple months while I tried to find a belt better than this one. There isn't any though. I am buying another Milwaukee 49-17-0190"
4,Good Daily Use Toolbags,"These are very good professional tool bags. All the pockets are well thought out for your typical carpentry needs. I prefer my hammers on the side and tape in the back, so this was just what I was looking for. I wear them forty hours a week, and I've been happy so far. The one problem I've had is the belt isn't quiet small enought if you have a 32 inch waist. I had to punch new holes, and am right on the end, so hopefully it won't stretch any more."
4,very good value but some issues,"Much has been said positive which I mostly agree with but the loops for the suspenders do not work properly as designed. They easliy slide around causing poor fit and when you take the belt off the right end will slide off along with the bag[I wear rigs with the bags towards the side rear]. I have fixed the issue by not using the metal holes and flipping upside down so a clip on suspender can tightly pinch the loop on top of the belt and prevent it from sliding , holds the bags in place and is an easy fix , costs nothing, and now you have 4 metal attaching holes for other uses on the belt.I prefer my CLC and DeWalt rigs as the nylon is thicker and under-supports are better, but cost much more , no where the under $30 price of this. They also have Velcro on the belt and system pieces to lock the position of the bags, etc. I use this Milwaukee rig for lighter use."
4,Milwaukee Tool Belt,"Excellent belt. Has lots of capacity and functionality for all kinds of tools. Outside pouches have flat bottoms that facilitate the retrieval of nails and other small items. The covered pocket for a cell phone keeps it protected and prevents it from getting lost. Speaking of lost, the front pocket for a box cutter needs to have a closed bottom. I put one in there and it slipped out. The tool belt capacity can result in a lot of weight. It has suspender clips and I recommend purchase of suspenders, especially if you have a small waist."
1,It breaks easily,The clipper broke the first time I tried to use it. The guide combs snap onto the metal bottom plate. To remove the guide comb from the bottom plate you have to push a little plastic tab on the rounded back end of the guide comb. I had just opened the package and snapped on the half inch guide comb to see how securely it fit. When I pushed it off the whole metal plate fell out of the plastic body of the clipper and the cutting edge fell out. I was able to put the pieces back together but it didn't cut worth a darn. Don't waste your time or money on this product.
5,Amazing.,This album is just fantastically awesome! It's a shame that this band is so underrated! You should really but this album! From start to finish the whole album is a thrill. Some say it sounds like nine inch nails but I say it sounds like awesome! No but seriously its a great album.
2,Not well done,"For over ten years I've used Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book for making yeast and leavened (wild yeast) breads. Mostly the former. It has one recipe, however, for a whole-grain leavened bread which is more sophisticated than a rustic sourdough. That recipe alone is worth the book's price and produces a more flavorful and healthful bread than the sourdough leavened white bread I just made using a recipe from Classic Sourdoughs. Additionally, Classic Sourdoughs is not well edited for clarity, contains a fair amount of incidental information not relevant to learning how to bake breads, and lacks the extensive research that went into creating Laurel's Kithchen Bread Book. Unless you cannot obtain good quality whole wheat flour or have a strong preference for white flour, Laurel's Kitchen is a much better value for your time and money."
2,Highly overrated book and recipes,"This book is a good source of sourdough history and theory. I am dissapointed in the directions that are provided. Depending on which recipe you follow in this book, or in the shipped directions provided with his starter cultures. I found a recipe in the book that says to bake for 40 to 45 minutes, then another for 70 minutes in his mailed booklet for the same San Francisco Sourdough bread. His directions are very confusing and not done in an orderly fashion. My best results came with a temperature change(measured by a real oven thermometer)above that which he recommends, and a diferrentbake time. I like the book, but don't buy it for recipes or clear directions as it is too confusing."
4,Neat Book,"So far I like the book. I would give it five stars but I have yet to go through all of the recipes and suggestions! It's simple and easy to understand and comprehend. More than a recipe book but a book of history and facts that lends a touch of ""Awe"" to every loaf of sourdough bread we make and that it is a herritage that has changed little reaching back thousands of years."
2,Good Information...Recipes Not So Good,"I began following this author quite a while ago including reading ealier books because there wasn't that much information about baking sourdough bread. He has simplified the directions a little but I was never successful with his directions until I took a course at King Arthur and discovered that baking sourdoughs isn't all that complicated. Now I make naturally leavened bread almost every week. I finally trashed the silly ""proof box"" that Mr. Wood recommends. I occasionally dip into this book to try the recipes and I'm pretty sure some of them have significant errors (the SF sourdough turns out more like a ciabatta because either the flour or water measurments are wrong). If you want a really good book on bread baking check out ""Bread A Baker's Book of Techniques and Recipes"" by Jeffrey Hamelman. It has lots of good sourdough recipes based on solid baking formulas."
2,Good Book but be careful if you get any starters,"I have used the recipes in this book and they work pretty well with the Sourdough starter from King Arthur Flour - I then purchased some starters from Ed Wood and followed the instructions in the book. When they did not revive (they came dried) his basic reply was ""tough"" even though they claim you will get a refund. Since the book is an infomercial for his starters I would think they would be a little more friendly!!"
2,what a disappointment !!!!!!!!!,"My whole incentive for purchasing this book was that I was under the perception that it would go into great detail on how to create, or activate, and maintain sourdough cultures. The author spends a whole one and a half pages on this topic only!!!!Do not purchase for the recipes--- nothing special at all.The process is explained in much better detail in other books on Artisan Baking (like Peter Reinhardt's' ""Crust and Crumb"".In addition, I purchased dried cultures from his company ($ 35.00), and when I had vital questions during activation, it took him six days to respond. When I then sent a series of (distressed) inqueries, he tells me ""buy my book, the answers are there!!! "".I had already bought the book --- and it is over-rated. This ""king of cultures"" is vague on detail, and impatient with support."
4,Advanced focus drills,This video is a long series of trainers doing focus drills with a variety of mitts and punching pads. It is a low quality transfer with spotty sound and no explanations other than what the trainer is telling the fighter (if you can hear it). It was worth $10 to me just to see the variety of approaches (the trainers are all top-notch). I can figure out most of the drills but that could be a challenge for someone new to the sport.
5,Duplex outlet with 2 USB ports,The device fit snugly into the wall box but included competent directions and was reasonably easy to install. It is much preferable to using device chargers that typically come with products which usually remain plugged in and using some electricity. Between my wife and I we had four chargers plugged into wall outlets. The chargers were used infrequently but remained plugged in so we didn't have to search for them when they were needed. Now we have one USB socket populated with the cable for our MP3 players and the other is populated with a mini USB cable with a removable micro USB adapter which handles both of our smartphones and other rechargable devices.
3,Not high powered USB,"I bought this product so that I could have more outlets for charging near my bed. I've got an Asus Transformer, my Blackberry, and my clock (for a total of 3 clocks). My goal was to have both USB devices charge using the USB ports so that I'd have one outlet free. However, the power output from the USB ports is insufficient for my Asus Transformer. It charges the Blackberry and my wife's Android phone just fine, but it doesn't fully conform to the current Battery Charger specs for USB 2 or 3 which allow for higher voltages/currents.Otherwise, it works very well. Installation was simple (although the clearance in the box was almost nil), and it looks just fine.UPDATE: I got an iPad Mini. This charges it perfectly."
4,iPad3 charging with 2.1 amps,"Nice: iPad3 charging with 2.1 amps works perfectly. One star off, for installation difficulty. It was hard to make all (ground, hot, neutral) wires to fit inside a small junction box. Typically have to work with 3 solid copper wires of 14 AWG or 12 AWG size. Daisy chaining receptacles doubles the number of wires -- ouch! Suggested product improvement: include a short piece (say 3 inch long) 16 AWG multistranded (green) wire for grounding + wire nut (twist-on wire connector) ... would make it easier to cram all the wires inside the box."
5,A tight fit,"This has helped clean up the area around my desk by eliminating two chargers. Just be aware that the electronics behind the face plate are BIG and I had to wrestle it into the junction box along with all of the wires. If you are not comfortable with wiring a socket, I'd get help to install this."
2,Only 1 usb port works,"I installed this outlet and wired it according to the instructions. Both plugs and one usb port have power. Unfortunately, one of the usb ports does not power on."
1,Returned.,Bought this as we thought it would a great idea. It did not work well with the outlets and it seemed to pull too much away from the socket.
2,Didn't Charge my Tablet,I bought this outlet as I thought it would be easier to charge many of my devices without having to use the adapters. The device I was planning to use with it the most was my Android Asus Transformer Tablet. Even though the description indicates that it has 15AMP for the USB which is required for most tablets like the iPad it wouldn't charge mine. When plugging a phone or iPod in it works just fine but for my primary purpose this product didn't meet my needs or expectations.I didn't see any other reviews or comments related to the iPad or other tablets so if you are thinking of using it for that purpose beware.
1,No UL listing for this device,"I have checked the Underwriter's Laboratory website and found NO LISTING for either ""Fastmac"" or ""TruePower"" (the company name listed on the PDF installation instructions for the Fastmac). I contacted UL directly and they have no devices listed for either company. Simply quoting the UL categories under which such a device MIGHT be listed is not sufficient. Unless 'Abbi' can provide a legitimate UL file number for the device, I would have to consider that it is NOT UL approved. I would hesitate to install one in my home, especially considering that the extra depth of the device would cause a crowded wiring condition in a standard 2.5 inch outlet box."
1,"No UL listing, No sale","This device does not indicate that it has a UL listing. Many other, but not all similar devices sold here on Amazon also do not have a UL listing.As a fireman, I know that if you are in the US and have a fire, and the cause of the fire is determined to be this device, and it is not UL listed, your insurance WILL NOT PAY!It seems to be false economy not to buy an UL listed outlet.One reviewer mentioned TUV in Germany. That's fine - if you live in Germany. Although, it is my understanding that Germany uses a different plug configuration and 220V, not 110V, so I don't think this product is intended for the German market."
3,BEFORE YOU ORDER,"BEFORE YOU ORDER take out the plug you currently have and see how big your box is. If there is not room for an extra inch of depth and a half inch of width in your box this product will not fit in that box and probably no where in your house. Sad, I know. You could make it work, but that is a larger job that I want to take on at the moment. This product is a standard outlet with a rear attachment measuring about an inch in depth. It also extends to the left about a half inch. I am sadly returning it, perhaps I will reorder when I have time to tackle the project or ripping out the old small box."
5,Great,It charges my I-pad and I-phone and it is very handy to have the USB available. Nice product. It is bigger than most sockets but still installed fine.
2,Will not work with Blackberry :(,I bought this but unfortunately did not read the reviews and found out too late that it will not charge myblackberry torch 9800.
3,Not what I expected,"Had a few good ideas, but only has 4 pages in color. Everything else is in black & white. I will look for a more recently published book with lots of great color photos. Wish I had taken a look before I purchased. For me, not a very good buy."
4,Need better packaging,The handle on the hammer was messed up because apparently it got hung in some machine at the USPS. I don't thing this would have happened had it been in a box instead of a plastic envelope. Otherwise everything was ok.
5,More than you expect!,"A great wealth of knowledge is packed into this volume. It includes extensive info about Spain as well, including the Reconquista and Age of Exploration. This is the only place I have been able to find detailed maps of both Bolivar and San Martin's campaigns in English. I would have liked to see a bit more about British & American imperialism in the 19th century, but overall it is a great book. I would puchase a newer, up-to-date version in a heartbeat."
2,The Sooner the Better,"I think Debbie Macomber is a great writer, however, the Deliverance Company books were a disappointment because of all of the explicit sex situations taking place among the characters in the book. This series could have been interesting and exciting without all the sex she included. This certainly wouldn't fall under Christian fiction and I am disappointed in Debbie for writing this way."
2,Disappointed.....,"Disappointed in this book and in the reviews I read here. The main character was annoying, shallow and unbelievable. The characters were not well developed. The story was predictable. I found myself skimming through most of the boring dialog. Sorry Debbie....this one was just silly and a waste of my time and money."
4,Suprisingly Good Read,"This was a surprise to me to see Debbie Macomber write a tale of intrique. I did not expect I would enjoy this as much as what I have come to love about Debbie Macomber's style. Boy, was I ever wrong.I loved this book! I highly recommend!"
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately I found this book to be very disappointing and in fact stopped reading half way through. Many character, plot and dialog inconsistancies.....difficult to like the characters. Lots of action but not a believable romantic relationship."
1,Don't waste your money - doens't even load up,We bought this CD from Best Buy and it wouldn't even load. It crashed our Windows XP computer each time we tried to load it. Don't waste your money.
1,"To paraphrase Roger Ebert - I hate, hate, hate, hated this book","I bought this book many years ago, when it was relatively new on the market. What I found on reading it, instead of the light, pulpy anthology I thought I'd find, was a selection of either impenetrable 'arty' tales that made little sense to me, sex scenes with no point beyond shock and titillation, and one of the most vile, nauseating stories I've ever had the misfortune to read - 'The Stick Woman.' The sheer sexual sadism of this piece still inspires nausea at the thought to this day; I am filled with remorse that I ever read it.So unpleasant was this book, that is the only book I have ever ripped up and thrown in the trash. Looking back, I wish I had burned it too."
4,Overall pretty good stories.,"COuld've been better and stronger, but definitely worth reading. I wouldn't pay much for it, but if you can get it used grab it."
1,A twisted collection of bizare fantasies,"I guess each of us have our own perception of what ""Horror and Cutting Edge Terror"" represents. At first blush, Darkside appeared to possess qualities that would fit in these categories. Further scrutiny of selected works however, most notably Edward Lee's ""The Stick Woman"", ran the gambit of imprisonment, mutilation, torture, sadistic degradation to woman as a whole and some of the most sexually explicit imagery I have read in my life! To my amazement, this book is available to the masses, including"
1,Yuck,"Can't we rate this in the negatives???The stories in this collection related to no particular type of 'horror' and, in all, it was a poor mix of sloppy writing and ridiculous ideas. Burning your money would be best before puchasing this...collection."
1,Boring!,The only reason I gave this book a 2 was for Ed Lees story. Go to the bookstore and read that story and buy anything by him that you can get your hands on. Just don't waste your money on this junk!!!!
3,"Great toy, but falls apart 2 easily?","I love this toy, it's great and my child loves it, however he gets frustrated because it falls apart easily, the cape and gun. Other than that, it's a good toy."
3,talking zurg,our grandson loves anything to do with toy story. we and he found that it is very hard to hear zurg talking.
2,Examining a boring life through a high-powered microscope.,"First, let me state that I have been impressed by all the Canin I have read prior to starting ""Blue River."" The problem with this novel isn't that it follows pattern similar to Canin's other works, most notably ""For Kings and Planets,"" a far more mature novel, but that the protagonist is very hard to empathize with. A successful California optimologist, the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism. When he's not bothering with that, he's repeatly over-describing his less successful brother (After the first few times, I understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school). There's a good story here, but it's trapped under a poor, plodding narrative."
5,Superbly Written and Moving,"I felt compelled to add my review to this long list of largely negative ones in hopes that I could convince someone else to ignore them and pick up this book. This is a stunning, beautifully written book about two brothers who have become estranged. The story takes us back to where the brothers grew up and describes events leading up to their eventual separation. No, Canin doesn't give us a neat package of which brother was evil through and through, or who is the most guilty. But, that is exactly why this book is so good and will stay with you long after you read it. As Lawrence writes to Edward, ""One day you're going to have to decide about me. You're going to have to decide how much of what you thought about me was in your imagination."" If you like Ethan Canin, do yourself a favor and give this book a try."
4,An Admirable First Novel,This book displays in abundance the fine style and care for his characters that so distinguish Canin's subsequent work. Well worth reading.
2,Lost squirrel and songbirds,"Even though the goal of keeping our audacious squirrel away from the feedeR was accomplished, we seem to also have lost many of our songbirds. Chickadees seem the only ones who get seeds out of this feeder."
1,Poorly designed feeder,I am so disappointed with this product it's hard to be objective--- it was designed to keep squirrels out but the surrounding grid is so dense even small chickadees cannot reach the seed. Unbelievable! I actually cut away some of the metal to make the openings bigger to allow the birds better access to the feed! The results were minimally successful. The birds do not like it! This is why buying things online is often disappointing. It's better to physically see and examine the product before selecting it using only a picture. This feeder is either going to a garage sale or into the garbage.
1,Not Squirrel Proof!,"Oh goodness, yet another ""fail"" with a bird feeder. This feeder worked fine for about 2 weeks. Different birds were attracted to it (cardinals cannot access seeds from this type of feeder) and the squirrels stayed away. But then they had a meeting or something and came up with a great plan. So one day I look outside my window and see a squirrel swinging on the feeder while another squirrel sat underneath, eating the seeds as they fell. I was incredulous, thoroughly annoyed and yet impressed. Squirrels are diligent critters. So we had to buy a baffle. It keeps the squirrels off the feeder, but they still eat the seeds off the ground and chase away mourning doves and other birds they prefer ground feeding."
5,Truely Squirrel Proof,I have been using these feeders for years. The locking disk for the top is a little cumbersom to use and I took it off the first one. Don't do that. The squirrels will eventually lift the lid and damage the top of the inner screen.
3,Duncraft squirrel proof bird feeder #188834,"I gave the Duncraft bird feeder an A+ for keeping squirrels out, but a D- for keeping the seeds in. I put sunflower seeds in my feeder and the seeds comes out of the sides and the bottom. When the birds remove the seeds from the feeder the other seeds falls out. I had to refill the feeder at twice a week, because half the seeds were on the ground."
2,Squirrel proof feeder,"This product worked very well for keeping the squirrels away from the seed. We used it for sunflower seeds as smaller seed didn't appear to work very well. However, the birds did not like it. They appeared to have difficulty getting the seed and our enjoyment of many birds utilizing our feeder was reduced. We decided to return it to the seller."
1,Dunproof 18834 Squirrel Proof Blocker,"Birds love it, but most of food falls out. Squirrels shake it and food falls out. Would not recommend purchasing this."
2,Storyline lacks Substance,This movie was definitely produced under sub-standard conditions. The determination of the main character is admirable but the plot tends to be a bit unbelievable.
4,Dancehall Queen,I loved this movie! A widower uses her smarts to outwit two dangerous men responsible for her husband's death and further abuse to her and her family. She becomes the mystery lady and enter a dance contest which results in the end to all her problems. A Fantastic film! Wonderful music! African accent.
5,Dancehall Queen,I thought this movie was all that. My boy Beenie Man did his thing!!! The plot was really good. I was actually able to understand the patois after watching a few time. I really encourage reggae fans to watch this movie. It's off the hook!!!
4,"If you loved the movie, you will love this","I really enjoyed most of the cd. I would have liked some other songs to replace 2 of the remixes of the ""Dancehall Queen"" track. I jammed to ""Little and Cute"", ""Joy Ride"", and ""My Jamaican Guy"". And the track ""Unbelievable"" reminded me of my husband! All in all, this was a great cd and I would buy it for a friend."
4,solid movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. The characters were believable and most of the actors did an excellent job. If you're looking for something heavy this is not for you. This is a lighthearted movie that west-indian people can relate to on many levels. It is true that young island women often find themselves with much older men that can offer them financial security in these hard times and it shows how mothers are sometimes willing to turn a blind eye to the situation around them. I have seen this alot. All in all this movie serves its purpose to entertain. There is good music, dance and jokes cant done. Latah."
5,the only movie that i have seen over 20 times i love it!,"personally i think this is the best movie i have ever watch that was produced in ja wicked, wicked movie marcia is a wicked dancer i do not for one moment regret my 25.00 dollar investment. when are you all going to make another one like it?"
4,Jamaican Street Vendor Makes Good,"Marcia has problems. She's barely surviving as a Kingston higgler, her 15 year old daughter, Tanya, is fending off avances from lecherous, 40-something year old ""Uncle Larry,"" and she hasn't had a good man in a long, long time.When a seemingly unrelated incident sets off a tragic chain of events that leaves her good friend Sonny dead and her brother Junior scared for his life, Marcia realizes that she must take matters into her own hands.Set in the fascinating world of the Kingston ancehall scene (with a side trip into the go-go racket), the movie is truly a girl-power fairytale with a West Indian edge.Note: If you are not fluent in Jamaican patois, watch this movie with a friend from the islands. Or watch it over and over, until you get it. It is worth it."
5,Definitely De Wickedest Movie Out of Jamaica,"This is movie was easy to relate to and down to earth, definitely real life. Marcia was the true dancehall queen. In America a 15 year old sleeping with an older man is sort of a taboo subject, in other parts of the world it is normal. The movie was great and I encourage all who love reggae to see it."
1,"looks nothing like the picture, not even the same","I was sent a piece of paper thin felt, thought i was ordering a filter. don't waste your time or money."
5,A bizzare but worthy thriller,"OK, we've all read at least one of Dick Francis' early novels. The usual components are there: HORSES, racing, mystery, and often a physical or psychological character defect. (I write this, having a hearing loss, so I can appreciate the effort!) The main character, Gene Hawkins, is an intelligence agent who once had his heart ripped out. (I always wanted to write that last phrase) In his agony, he has to escort his boss's nubile 17-year-old daughter to California, to solve a horse kidnapping. Living in the 21st century, trust me, you will not guess the ending of this novel. We need a few more authors with this sense of decency."
2,Too Odd,"Gene Hawkins has a longstanding desire for committing suicide. That is very unlikely for a Dick Francis hero. Indeed, Hawkins is a typical Francis hero; a man of a strong will, an indomitable spirit and a detached mind, yet he bears a wish for killing himself. That's too odd. The story is not bad as a mystery, but I can't tolerate such inconsistency in the hero's character."
2,I made it to chapter 3,"I bought this book immediately after reading Enquiry, which I liked very much. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this one. I made it to chapter to three....barely. I wanted to like this book, but frankly I was bored by both the plot and the characters. Maybe next time."
5,Fun thong,This thong is great for summer and/or at the beach. Very comfortable but runs a 1/2 size smaller. I wear a regular 8M but had to order a 1/2 size larger for perfect fitting.
4,Great product in good condition,"I love this nailer. It performs great and it durable. I had used a friends and decided to purchase a reconditioned nailer. First, I have to say that cosmetically, it did have many bumps and brusies on it so unlike a reconditioned electronics product, you can definately tell that the product is used. However, it is a nailer, it is going to get bumped and brusied when you start to use it anyway so that didn't bother me.In general, I will buy reconditioned again from Amazon."
2,Buy the Porter Cable Instead,"I used a Porter Cable for several years. When it quit, it was cheaper to buy this Bostitch than to have it overhauled. I wish I had gone for the overhaul.Inconsistent depth. Often double fires. It jams a lot, but on the plus side it is easier to clear jams than the Porter Cable.I regret this purchase.Jim"
5,Wonderful!!!,"What a startling movie. I recommend everyone find the opportunity to watch this WITH their families. Start discussing these matters WITH your children. Too many parents are patting their children on the heads, and sending them off to school to ""learn"". The schools are instilling values where parents should be. Parents must pay attention!"
1,Demonizing Teachers,"This ""documentary"" is a propaganda piece for the charter schools movement that viciously demonizes teachers. It's not about kids, it's about ideology and greed. This is hardly the path that will lead us into a golden age of public education. I would give it less than one star if I could."
1,A lot of misconceptions....,"Watch this with a teacher with 35 years of experience in both private (Catholic) and public education AND with union involvement for 22 of those years if you REALLY want to know the truth about education (at least in California...and, by extension (taught in a school on a naval base with kids transferring in and out), other states...if you really want to improve education in this country, start with the educational bureaucracy before hammering the teachers' unions....BTW...poor teachers CAN be released if an administrator follows due process as presented in this film...."
1,Marketing tactic on behalf of for-profit schools,"This film is manipulative crap. There's a world of money to be made dismantling public schools, and bringing in for-profit private charters--who in point of fact do *not* have a better record than public schools (even though they can avoid taking the toughest students!). See Diane Ravitch for more information on this. That's the money and narrative behind this film, straight on through to the cynical and manipulative end."
1,Horrible documentary,"A horrible documentary. Based on what I know about the teaching profession, it is a downright lie at best. I coldn't in all honesty recommend this trash to anyone."
1,Sheer propaganda,"This ""documentary"" is so misleading and slanted it should be listed as a comedy, except the damage that this film and the billionaires behind it have done to America's children isn't funny. This film is the face of the destruction of the middle class being perpetrated by the Koch brothers, Eli Broad, and Bill Gates. Do not buy this film!"
2,A RIGHT WING ATTACK ON TEACHERS AND THEIR UNIONS,"Very manipulative and disappointing. The sufferings of children are exploited to further a hard right agenda: get rid of unions and go after selected teachers. The film points out that Finland has the best schools on earth but fails to mention its strong teachers union. Unlike our teachers those in Finland are well paid and respected. Our hard right selfishly seeks to cut school funding (while lowering taxes for the very rich), exactly the wrong approach. Indeed, these are the policies that caused the problems shown in the film. Defunding our public schools will simply intensify the suffering."
2,Incomplete and sometimes inaccurate,"The good: the way the scenes are done and old footage or cartoons are worked in is good enoughl; decent music; the problem of a broken school system is a huge one.The bad: Too much talk about bad teachers and no discussion whatsoever of bad kids and worse parents. Blaming teachers for everything wrong makes no sense, since they are but one link in a complex chain. Also, the narrator has a very halting style of talking that is distracting. And Michelle Rhee? She's gone. Resigned. Her mentor lost his job because of her failures.This is not one of the better documentaries of recent years."
5,I waited a long time for this movie to come out on Blu-Ray,"Every since they begin documentation and running previews about this research happening, I waited in anticipation to have it out on Blu-Ray to purchase for my personal Library! I am so thankful that the research and powerful stories were presented through this wonderful work. However, I am very saddened that all the students highlighted in this research weren't selected for higher learning during the lottery process! We have got to do better education of our younger generations!!!!!"
5,A sobering reality check on America's school system,"I knew that I would enjoy this movie since I fully agree with its premise, namely that America is failing its school children to an unconscionable extent. I was not prepared for the quality of the production or the degree to which the thesis was proved. My heart goes out to those kids in this movie who missed a change at a decent education and I am downright angry at the system that is depriving them of their opportunities in life. This movie must be a wake-up call to all American Parents to call their legislator and demand a better system.Thank God that my wife was able and willing to homeschool our kids. I honestly could not look them in the eye if I had not been willing to do that for them."
3,Nothing New,Teachers' unions resist any and all improvements. Democrats will meet any union request to keep getting huge campaign donations. Charter schools get high test scores out of the poorest kids. Certain districts continue to have over 60% dropout rates. Less than 1% of bad teachers can ever be fired. We are headed from 20th to 30th place in math and science. All of it is true.
5,Abolish Both Teacher's Unions,"The take-away here is that the sacrosanct, omnipotent teachers unions have a stranglehold on our education system and the future of this country. There is no need for unionization of teachers. They're an anacronism well past their time. They contribute more to the Democrat Party than all the labor unions combined, so they're feared and have way too much power. When they say ""It's all about the kids."", they're lying."
2,"very disappointing, overrated","one long save the black children ad. political schmaltz, conventional luxe production, contains some disturbing truths and facts about the decline of American education scattered in its propagandistic staging and sermonizing. awful narrator, even worse music track. it lacks only Diane Sawyer weeping over cocktails. but it does make a good case for doing away with teacher's unions and giving Michelle Rhee a better shot."
1,Fraud,"This movie is nothing more than veiled propaganda, aimed at weakening the public perception of public education. Michelle Rhee is a power hungry individual who wants nothing more than the complete privatization of our public schools. This would of course lead to re-segregation and teachers becoming walmart style associates. Get the facts behind the corporate education movement, your kids WILL suffer if Rhee and her ilk get her way."
1,Soooo one sided,"Tenure does NOT mean ""...keep your job forever and there's no way to be fired"". Tenure means ""You will receive 'due process' for your position"". This means the evaluation is much deeper than children failing tests. Also, the students chosen for charters may be expelled if they fail or have behavioral issues. Public schools do not have this ""luxury"" of removing difficult students. BY THE WAY, did anyone notice how not ONE student was a ""bad"" or ""difficult"" student throughout this documentary? Tell it all: true perspectives."
3,lol,"most of the material that is taught in schools can be also taught by parents. my initial thought;this guy is funny, like if he cant teach his kids anything, lol right away private school."
5,A wake-up call,"This movie is must-see for all that wonder what's going on with public education in the US. In fact, for all who depend on public education.... Our kids' future is going down the drain fast. We have to take responsibility"
5,A must see for everyone w/ school ages children,Now we know why most of our students can't succeed in life with the embarrassment that our public school system has become. Our children graduate school and don't know the simple basics. Pity.
5,Makes it's point.,Not all teachers are created equal. We can't just keep dumping money into education when those we pay aren't all doing the same quality of work.
5,Union v. Non-union,22% of the comments were given a 4 or 5 rating. My guess: Union originated comments.An outstanding film for an open mind;a terrible film for a lazy tenured teacher.
1,Feels like watching a fund raiser video,"This felt more like a video you'd watch just before someone asks if you can donate some money to their cause, that cause being the subject of the film you just watched. I regretted renting this. I love to watch documentaries but this one was just boring.NOTE:Hey fellow Amazonians. Hey, you think you could do me a favor and click on the helpful button. I'd like to bring my FOUND HELPFUL to NOT FOUND HELPFUL ratio up higher than it is now. Thanks ahead of time for helping me out."
3,Is there an unbiased documentary about anything?,"Not really because that wouldn't be very interesting. Take the facts, and investigate them. You'll find things aren't as simple as anyone portrays them. The best thing is that they get you thinking, and then it's up to you."
1,Extremely agenda biased.,"This movie is a pure agenda movie. The only reason this film was made was to forward a political agenda to forward the agenda for privatization of school districts.I know it was considered powerful, and it makes sense because our schools are failing, but as always in documentary style you find over-generalization and editing making a stronger case than really exists. Teacher tenure, unions, suffering schools, all are targets of the film.Reform is a great thing, but if you wanted to really learn about it and improve schools you should research those who actually have done research. Kozol who has written many books on the subject gives a completely opposing view point of this film. The last thing that should happen is the United States taking a political propaganda film and use it to punish the good teachers and make it harder for the poorest students to get a fair shake."
1,"unfortunate, very unfortunate","This film is intentionally misleading. By design it paints a painfully incorrect portrait of public education. It purposefully misrepresents teachers' unions. It's a shameful work meant to deceive the general public about their education system. The worse thing about it is that its purpose is not to improve public education but to simply privatize it and to discredit teaching as a profession in order to remove job security (due process) and steal teachers' pensions. Among the many egregious lies two really stand out. First, it claims that the entire public education system is harming American students. The fact of the matter is that our public education system performs extraordinarily well. It does happen to underperform in areas of intense segregation and poverty, which leads to the second lie. This piece of deception actually makes the claim that our schools are the cause of high poverty and intense segregation."
3,"Disappointed with ""Waiting for Superman""","I espected the film to be an unbiased, objective assessment of public education. It isn't. Instead, it promotes charter schools as the cure for public education. While discussing the problems in low income areas, it shows students,presumably from these areas with perfect teeth, very nice clothes,shoes, etc."
5,Excellent film,"I was skeptical about this film when I heard about it but a friend got me to watch it. I have to say, I was impressed. I started taking notes. The movie starts out kind of slow but becomes very good as it starts to describe the problems that good teachers face and that students are stuck with.* The cost of 4 years of prison could pay for 8 years of private education.* Milwaukee tenured teachers being fired and rehired with back pay.* The lemon/turkey/trash dance. And rubber rooms.* DC education obstacle being the adults.Tracking.Each of these topics was frustrating to hear are realities of public education. The scarey thing is, I'm not sure the problem is solvable.The last 15 minutes of the movie were dramatic as you watched the kids being followed in the movie try to get into the good schools."
3,Waiting for Superman,"I paid a little extra to expedite the order, but it still took a week to arrive. I thought it would have come a little sooner. However, the order was correct and it was well packed."
3,"worthwhile documentary, but worthy of criticism too","compared to your average ""movie"", WFS is very information, and engages you in reflection of the u.s. educational system. living in WI, the direct critique of unions is a bit hard to swallow at the moment, and as other viewers note, is not completely informed. davis does a good job of raising many issues and motivates for further discussion. the central question of eliminating ""failure factories"" and creating a positive education culture are very provocative, and present themselves as another seemingly intractable issue, like hunger and poverty in the u.s., that must be resolved through better equality and collaborative approaches. some parts are overly emotional/wretching, like watching about 10 minutes of the whole lottery process, that was too much. food for thought"
3,beautiful drawings but written for the young reader,"I bought this book mainly because I liked the drawings. I read it cover to cover. When I was done I gave it away.As a nature and hiking guide, it falls somewhat short. The maps are too small and the ecological insights too far between. It seems to be written for a younger (under 10) audience.Although it only covers plants and their habitats, my favorite book for this area is ""Florida Wild Flowers and Roadside Plants"" by Ritchie."
2,An Instant Guide to Trees,"When I got my book in the mail my face instantly went pale. It was not what I had hoped for, though my third grader will love it . The drawings/graphics are well done, but rarely any size data (how big is the leaf you're looking at for example) and not a single scientific name in sight. I think adults will tire of the book easily for there's not enough detailed infromation. If you have ever tried to distinguish a black oak from a red oak this book is not for you. At last, for $3.99 it's a good deal for your kids."
3,Instant Guide to Trees,"Real good drawings of tree leaves, needles and buds. Not any information on tree height (feet), bark or soil conpatibality. Good for beginners."
4,Instant Guide to Trees,My sister works in the garden department of Home Depot and she wanted a book to help her identify trees. She found this book extremely helpful.
2,An Instant Guide to Trees,"A very simple guide, no id key included, no scientific names, nice drawings, limited detail on hard choices such as Hornbeam or Hophornbeam. I will not be using this book as a field guide."
3,Didn't stick well,"My husband was quitting smoking so I ordered these for him since they were cheaper than in the store. He had a real problem with them falling off during the day. Usually Nicoderm sticks to his arm really well but this box didn't. They were before the expire date but the adhesive wasnt the greatest.He is smoke free now a couple months thanks to Nicoderm CQ patches but if I ever needed to buy them again I won't be buying online, we'll pay the few extra dollars to buy in the store"
5,12 Days After 40 Years,"I had smoked for 40 years and up to 2.5 packs per day.Doctor said I would not live to 65 years old if I didn't quit. (I'm 57 now)I had tried the patch before and had no luck.I had also tried Chantix with no luck.I recently tried again on the 1st day of this month.It did not stop my cravings. I continued to smoke with the patch for 3 days.Being desperate, I tried a patch and a half (I cut a patch in half). To my surprise, the next morning when I woke up, I had no cravings. I continued this for 4 days. I then went back to a single patch....I'm starting on day 12!!!!........I feel great!!!!!"
3,Single Drawer CD/DVD Storage,"I ordered 2 of these items and the keys to the 2nd drawer were some how lodged behind the drawer that does not come apart, so I had to really shake the box to get them to fall out. The drawers didn't really work well with the push button. When filled with CD's the only way to get the drawer shut was to lock it. I would recommend this product for long term storage such as back up CD's that you don't have to get to on a daily basis. Kind of a pain keeping up with the really small keys."
5,Cheap Trick Live At Budokan,Showed up fast and in good condition. Very happy and will order from them again! Thank you!:)
5,A wonderful book for everyone!,"I discovered this book for the first time in sixth grade; I finally found my own copy when I was in high school. I'm delighted to see that it still exists; I was afraid it was out of print. I'm 42 now, and I still read this book at least once a year. It combines ancient Egypt, romance, mystery, and intrigue all in one book. Mara is clever and shrewd, but all her cleverness can't overcome her feelings for Sheftu. And the best part of the book is when Sheftu is willing to give up everything he has for her. What a wonderful romance! I recommend this for everyone; I think it whets the appetite of kids to look into ancient history. Enjoy!"
2,Mara Daughter Of The Nile by a 4th grader,"I didn't like the book because it was too long,the vocabulary was too hard,it was too lovey dovey,and it was too confusing. I didn't learn anything. I didn't any of the characters. I am nine year old boy and I am in the 4th grade."
1,Why Do Teachers Make Us Read This Book?,"This book is so far the hardest book to understand. It just goes back and forth, and it even uses the Egyptian language. A great fictional book on ancient Egypt is ""Cleopatra, Daughter of the Nile"". It is easy to understand and Very interesting."
5,BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN!!,"I have most literally read this book more than 6 times!! It is full of intrigue, romance and excitement!! Everytime i read it i laugh, i cry and i am on the edge of my seat just like it was the first time!! You will not be able to put it down!!! Ms. McGraw is a genious with a pen!! I love her writing style; you're always interested, never bored!! You won't regret the purchasing of this book!!!"
5,Wow....You've GOTTA read this book,"This is really, truly, one of the greatest books that I have ever read. I know that in reviews that you sometimes get biased opinions, but this is a must read. The plot is FANTASTIC. It has just the right mix of action, suspense, drama, and a little romance thrown in to make this a compelling page turner. I have read it a lot of times, and each time I discover more. It portrays ancient Egypt exquisitely, and the writing is superb. As I said before, it is a HUGE page turner, one that you have to force yourself to put down. In short, this is an excellent book, and you should definitely purchase it. You will be glad you did!"
5,Mara=AWESOME!,"I am 14 almost 15 and I just finished reading Mara, It is the most awesome book I've ever read! It's filled with action, adventure, and romance. I am deperatly trying to find another book like it because it was soooo good! I REALLY hope someone makes a movie about it! I would so buy it! I was assigned this book for ancient history, and I only had a week to finish it. I knew I was going to have to read it alot to finish it and I didn't want to, but once I started reading it again i couldn't put it down! Normally I don't read alot but this book changed that! I REALLY REALLY REEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLYY HOPE SOMEBODY MAKES A MOVIE ABOUT THIS BOOK!!!!!! If you want to read an awesome book than you should definately read this one!"
4,Good read,"Mara, a young slave girl in Pharaoh Hatshepsut's Egypt, is this center of this cute, fast-paced and worthwhile novel. Although this novel was meant for YA, it's very enjoyable for adults as well. Egypt comes alive as Mara navigates the intrigues of the royal palace, acting as interpreter due to her skill with languages. I won't give anymore away, but if you want a quick read, this will do nicely."
4,historical and entertaining,"We bought this book to supplement my daughter's history curriculum. She enjoys the story, and several of the places and items described in the book are pretty accurate. It's a good book for a middle-school age child."
4,A childhood favorite,"This was one book that I remember reading when I was in fourth grade. I bought this copy for my daughter, who is a total bookworm. If you are interested in Ancient Egypt, this book is wonderful."
5,wonderful story,This is fun filled action pack story with clever romance.I am in 6th grade and had to read it for an assinghnment. Usually I would think a teachers books were annoying and stupid but I loved it so much I read it 2 more times. I think this book is something you should take a chance on.
5,My Review,"I don't want to give the story away but i recommend it to anyone who loves action, suspense, romance, humor, this book covers every great theme! Here are some more:treachery, loyalty, etc... It's just great, read it!"
5,One of the best books I ever read.,This is probably one of my favorite books. It is adventurous and I am learning about Egypt this year. It really gets you psyched about learning about Egypt and people who lived at that time. I think Eloise should make a sequel or get the book made into a movie.
4,"Cerf Board, continued","Published in 1948, this is the sequel to ""Try and Stop Me"". Again wonderfully illustrated by Carl Rose. Mr. Cerf has separated this volume into sections like a large Sunday newspaper. Including The Theatre, Book Review, Hollywood, Financial, Travel, Sports, and Society. Stories again cover a range of persons: Will Rogers, Mark Twain, Jack Benny etc. There is an index included in the back. As with all of Bennett's early works, there are some stories that in today's society, some may consider politically incorrect. As Bennett as said he doesn't mean any ill will, or try to convey any prejudice. It merely shows that all people, all of us, have funny moments and funny stories to tell."
5,Excellent overview of this field,"This textbook has been published in a new edition with 53 chapters covering a wide range of topics related to interventional cardiology. These chapters are organized into 6 sections, which include pharmacologic intervention, coronary and peripheral intervention, evaluation of interventional techniques, valvuloplasty and pericardial disease, outcome effectiveness, and emerging technologies. The chapter on historical perspectives by Richard Myler is a fascinating glimpse into the lives and struggles of the pioneers in this field, including Dr. Andreas Gruntzig. The chapters are well-written, with clear subtitles and photos. A selection of color photos is included at the beginning of the book; most photos are black and white. Each chapter has an extensive bibliography to support the review material presented. This book is an excellent addition to the library of the cardiologist interested in intervention."
3,...,"I have the 2006 european version which is the same besides the seat fabric. Its a cool stroller but I haven't used it yet because its been broken for almost a year now and dorel won't help resolve the problem. The hydraulics are set inside the main tube and presses against a metal piece which reinforces the stroller when expanded, and bears the force when you collapse the stroller. Well that metal piece broke no longer has the hydraulic action. While I can still manually expand it and it still locks into place, I dare not put my son on it because without that hydraulic piston reinforcing the weight, the stroller with collapse. If anyone can help I woujld appreciate it.Another problem is the tire started leaking but I managed to find Innertubes from a sporting good store to replace them. In case you end up with a puncture or leak in your tires ( As many or most people will ) You want to replace the innertube with a 12"" tube."
3,looking for a capri seat replacementnin capri,"Hello,I have a capri quinny buzz stroller and I would like to buy a new seat cover but I can't find any. I was thinking in maybe buy the black one but I can't find a black hood to go qith it. Does anyone know where I can find them?Thank you so much"
1,decent but nothing special,"This is a 3-star stroller, maybe a 4-star, at under $200.At the current price, it's a big fat zero, but I have to give it one because it looks neat.If you want to pay an enormous amt of money for looks, rather than giving the difference to charity or buying books or putting it in your kids' college fund, then go to town.I was not impressed however ... but like I said, if you've got money to earn and price is immaterial to you, go for it."
5,Great Buy,"This watch is great. It is so beautiful and a great accent for a business man or a club goer. I am a banker and having a great gold watch completes my overall look as a professional. I have rather large hands and wrists and the watch was still a little loose, however, this is a good thing. For one there are people with larger wrists than I have and some people prefer to have a looser fitting watch. I took mine to a jeweler and they had a link removed in two seconds. The overall fit and finish of the watch is unbelievable. The little details are what really turn me on the this watch (I could name them but they're already listed). The little dvd it comes with is awesome it makes you a little expert on the watch and there are many things to learn about it. Would absolutely buy again."
3,'Winter' - the prequel to the 'Bernard Samson' series,"All those who have read any of the stunning series of nine linked novels about Bernard Samson and his friends, enemies and relatives - which begin with 'Berlin Game' and end with 'Spy Charity' - long to know more about the central characters and how they came to exist'Winter' is the chance to find the answers to many tantalising questions. Whilst it is a splendid story in its own right - covering a German family's rise and fall from pre-war times of Zeppelins and long dresses to the fall of Nazism in 1945 - the story appeals primarily to those readers who have already some aquaintence with the main characters of the novel series.This is not Deighton's most poetic book - too much to cover in so short a space - but it is still a good read of the 'family saga' genre."
3,Didn't do a whole lot for me.,"This was my 1st Len Deighton book, and to be honest, I didn't think a whole lot of it. The plot was a bit shallow and hard to follow. I never quite caught why one brother sided with the USA and the other with Germany; the book didn't describe the thought process in detail. Maybe Len Deighton isn't for me."
3,NOT SQUIRREL PROOF!!!,"Yes it takes some doing to assemble but it's not that hard.Yes the lid is very hard to take on and off.Also, the only way to hang it is by the handle which isn't designed for that.But my biggest gripe is that the squirrels can chew through the lid and get to the corn!"
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT,"Well I bought this item it came very fast...My husband and I both tried for two days to try and put the thing together, no instructions at all we looked online and found a 800 number they sent some kind of weird instructions so after hard labor we just sent it back and got our money back just as fast as we paid for this. I have nothing bad to say about this product."
3,Hot Babes,"well i just saw this film about a month ago and it's not that bad at all. some nice artwork, babes (as i stated before), and a half decent story ligne. Die hard fans of Burn Up should really enjoy this. if you're a first timer, you might want to rent it first or find someone who already has it."
3,50 minutes...,"of VERY brief nudity, not-very graphic bloodless violence and adult situations. Maki, Reimi and Yuka decide to go after McCoy, the head of a White Slavery ring, but find he is not just very powerful, but also ruthless.My tape was used but even when you take that into account the artwork was also aged, very dated. The tape's copyright was 1991, which places the production of the anime in the late 80s. The tape did have bonus production art, both in the closing credits and afterwards, so don't turn it off just because the credits stop scrolling. There is a couple of trailers at the start of the tape.Only two things link this story to Burn-Up W! The song ""Burn Up Your Heart"" and the fact that I was able to recognize Tiffany Grant's voice as one of the characters - Maki I believe. She is also Maki's English voice in Burn-Up W!Maybe a DVD would of gotten more than three stars, but the story is too bland to get more than three even with the extras."
3,An OK japanamation,"It has good animation (though i dont like the gay looks they give the charecters e.g big ball of sweat on forhead etc..) not much blood, a little bit of nudity. Good if your a die-hard anime fan."
4,DEMONTARA # 1,MY ADOLESCENT GRANDSON ENJOYS BOOKS WRITTEN BY DARREN SHAN. HE READ THE FIRST SERIES AND WANTED TO TRY THIS SERIES. FOUND IT TO BE VERY SUSPENSFUL AND KEPT HIS INTEREST. LOOKED FORWARD TO NEXT BOOK IN SERIES.
1,so cool,"its really cool and this kindle is my moms. even though its hers i read on it al ot. i read all of them and i also read cique du freak. right now im going to reread the vampire assiant. book 2 of the cique seris. if darren shan is readin this, my email is level5upatgmail.com. i hope he comes out with a new book."
3,Not as good as Cirque Du Freak,"The Cirque Du Freak series is perhaps my favorite series, so obviously I was very excited when I got a hold of this book. Much to my disappointment I found that this book was no comparison to the Cirque Du Freak series. It was fast paced and got to the point, but it din't reel me in. To me this was one of those books that you read once and never look at it again. The problem I had was that I expected this book to be amazing. After the Cirque Du Freak series I expected this author to be right up there with J.K. Rowling and Dan brown. What I can say about this book is that it was original. That is one thing that seems to be a theme with this author. Lord Loss is not like any other book. It is completely refreshingly unlike other books."
2,poor quality,I read this book a along time ago .. about 6years ago.I thought it was wonderful back then.Now that I am more educated I find this book to just be obnoxious.
4,A Terrifyingly Great Book,"Lord Loss is an exciting fantasy/horror story, filled with suspense that left me wanting to read more. After his parents are killed by the demon master, Lord Loss, a teenage is introduced into a world of demons and magic by his uncle. I think a lot of teenagers would enjoy reading this book. Darren Shan uses every word in the book to describe the characters, the thing around them, and their feelings. The story is completely unpredictable and I was left reading chapteer after chapter, The characters are realistic and I can relate to what they feel. I gave this book a 4 out of 5. It is one of my favorite books because of how the story is told which so much detail in every sentence."
4,A tapestry of harmonius sounds and stunning vocals,"I was introduced to the music of UMAN after hearing the selection entitled The White Spirit. (UMAN originates from a Native American word which means ""Earth Forces."") In this selection and throughout the entire CD, the French brother and sister duet create a myriad of vocal sounds, interwoven between pleasant harmonies featuring synthesizers, cello, saxophone, guitar, and keyboards. Their unique blend of alternative music is rich, vibrant and spatial -- open to the mind of the listener as to interpretation. The use of varying levels and picthes of the human voice by Danielle Jean is an exceptional treat. The masterfully crafted instrumental arrangements by Didier Jean jump forth and flirt with your ears and senses in a most pleasant and captivating manner."

4,"Not Great, but it can Tide You Over","As mentioned by the preceding reviewer, Naxos has done right by Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf, for this is but one of several discs of symphonies by him that can be had on the budget label. Of all the Naxos discs by Dittersdorf so far, this might well be my favorite. There's enough variety and invention to keep it from getting dull, though admittedly I find it a little hard to remember once it's finished. In my own opinion, Dittersdorf never did better than his concerto for harp -- not on this disc -- but overall he did better than most of his peers. For some decent music from an 18th Century also-ran, this release offers an adequate menu."
4,America's greatest natural resource,"Two words: Joe Walsh. The artistry, the sheer magnitude of Don Felder's and Joe's genius - on ""Hotel California,"" especially - on guitar more than made up for ""liberal-guilt"" Henley or ""dying for a hit single"" Frey. Shame the Iggles flamed out after Tim Schmitt and ""The Long Run."""
1,Hip-easy listening at it's worse,"This has two pretty good tracks - 'New Kid in Town' and 'Life In The Fast Lane'; and one track, the title track, that has interesting lyrics, but is spoiled by the limp reggae beat. (Check out 'Watching the Detectives' by Elvis Costello and 'Police and Thieves' by The Clash for a more productive use of reggae -artists who understood the genre.) The rest of the album is bland, disposable, certainly forgettable, soft rock. Hip-easy listening at it's worst."
1,horrible album,"The Eagles represented everything bad about music and nowhere better do they show us how bad they were than on this album. Album sales are always open to debate, especially where this band are concerned, but one fact remains, this album sold in the millions, but then again lots of sales do not prove an album is any good and the eagles proved that wit this monstrosity. Avoid."
1,What no Zero? Worst album ever?,"I was shocked at the 5 star reviews for this album. It might be the smuggest, most self centered collection of banal third rate rock ever recorded. The melodies are trite, the setiments predictable and hypocritical and their watered down Poco styled music is only matched by their watered down boogie rock. Pathetic. Perhaps the worst well known rock album ever. I'd give it Zero stars but there doesn't seem to be that option."
4,Yes they can produce hits,"Eagles can produce some great hits that you sing along with and experience, but not a complete album here with some songs just marking a bit of time."
5,Best Rock Album Ever Recorded.......,"Yes, this is the best rock album ever recorded. Just listen to the excellent song writing talents of Henley & Frey. It doesn't get any better. This album is perfection!!! Give it a listen."
3,"So, you don't like the album? Or, maybe you think it's genius?","Guess what? Everyone reading these reviews knows what's on it and has already made up their mind whether they like it or not, no thanks to any of you. In case some of you aficionados haven't noticed, this record is over 30 years old, but hey, thanks for your invaluable updates. How about you amateur music critics give it a rest, do the listening masses an actual service and instead of talking about music we're all well aware of with your noses in the air, YOU TRY LETTING US KNOW IF THE BLESSED 180 GRAM PRESSING IS ANY GOOD?Crimminy. This is almost as bad as the reviews for Dark Side of The Moon; you'd think some of you people found out about these songs last week."
2,Apart from the title track it is very mediocre and [bad],"5 stars? Get real. The debut from Eagles is worth highest rating but this album is far from that standard. Yes, there's the song ""Hotel California"" and I agree that it's one of Eagles' best ever, and probably one of the greatest songs regardless of artists/bands. Apart from ""Victim of love"" and ""Hotel California"", the material is quite weak and very uninteresting. ""New kid in town"" and ""Life in the fast lane"" are usually considered great among Eagles fans, but I believe they're both pretty [bad]. I suggest you get the three first albums because they display Eagles in their prime. I would give this album only 1 star if it wasn't for the song ""Hotel California"" (which is indeed a 5 star song)."
2,Boring wasted time.,"When I heard the song Hotel California I wanted that album. It was big mistake though, because when I bought and played it, I wanted a refund. The title song and Life In the Fast Lane was great, New kid in town was a good calm rocker. The rest are really boring fillers. Wasted time and its reprise was boring all the way through, Victim of Love was downright depressing and I hate depressing tunes, Pretty Maids All in Row was lousy and dreary. Try and Love Again was not good, and The Last Resort was big time filler. As a suggestion borrow somebody's HC album and get a copy of the first three songs. Stay away from the others if you don't to get torchered to death with bordom and depression."
1,Great Album BUT NEED A NEW 2010 REMASTER!!! 1990! too old!!!,"all eagles albums need a remaster, this is from 1990! the japan 2004 are too expensive, please a new 2010 remaster!!!"
1,Too bad I couldn't give 0,This Album is why I started listening to Punk. Self absorbed AOR. I just never got The Eagles...or why anyone did to begin with.
5,Improved mastering,I had an old (20+ years ago) copy of this CD that wasn't playing right in my iPod. I got this as a replacement and it's superior in all respects to the other one.
4,hotel california,"I can only rate on the appearance at this time. I bought it for a Christmas present. Appearance wise, it looks very good. pat"
5,Digitally Remastered!,"Without fanfare, Elektra has slipped a digitally remastered version of ""Hotel California"" into the pipeline, designated by a sticker on the front cover which states, ""Digitally remastered for the first time."" While it's unclear whether Elektra plans to upgrade the entire Eagles catalog, fans of the genre may also find Elektra's unballyhooed remastering of Jackson Browne's first six efforts (""Saturate Before Using"" through ""Hold Out"") a great way to ""Take It Easy"" in the meantime."
3,"""Selling-Out for money's sake""","I love The Eagles as much as anyone, but this album marked the end of what I loved about the Eagles. As a huge fan of Country-Rock and especially Southern California Country Rock, this album was a step in the direction of commercialism, and a ""step in the face"" of pre-Hotel California Eagles fans. Before this album The Eagles were the ideal Country-Rock band. Bernie Leadon(Ex-Flying Burrito Bro.) helped in defining some of those early sounds. Of course the record company wanted The Eagles to take their music in a more mainstream direction. So they dropped Leadon, and they also dropped their country sound. Hotel California is no doubt a great album in many respects, but true Country_Rockers should turn their ears in the direction of Poco, The Pure Prairie League, Firefall, The Flying Burrito Bros, The Byrds, Gram Parsons, Ian Matthews, and Buffalo Springfield.... and the first four Eagles albums"
1,Very Disappointed,"CD was advertised as a ""remastered"" version of the original release. Product received was same as original pressing only manufactured in Argentina without any kind of quality upgrade whatsoever. Very disappointed with product and Movie Mars, Inc."
1,This hotel isn't even 1 star,"Both The Eagles & Michael Jackson are rubbish and neither are the best. That honour belongs to the one and only Starland Vocal Band. Classics such as ""Starland"", ""Take Me Home Country Roads"" and the classic #1 singles Afternoon delight"" are much finer than anything you will ever find here."
1,Hotel California,Well the Eagles put out this album it's called Hotel California.There thats my whole review.
1,Don Henley Must Die,"Once upon a time there was a country-rock band called the Eagles. Everyone who was not a hillbilly found them incredibly annoying. One day, they decided to write a song about a hotel in California and call it (Here comes the big surprise) Hotel California. They then put it on an album that sold a bunch of copies. However, all those poor people didn't know that they had wasted a lot of money on songs that either turn out to be an ingenious combination of annoying and boring. The song Hotel California is one of the best-known of all time but really is just a bunch of hillbillys trying to sing and write good songs but coming up way, way short. And the rest isn't much better."
1,"One song, and that's it",This album has the merit of containing the only worth song of the Eagles: HOtel California.
1,NO STARS FROM ME!,"This is junk. Simply put this is one of the worst albums ever put out. Mind you, so is everything the eagles put out. Forget this awful excuse of an album. It's nothing but club lounge pap/elevator music for the has been's of the pop world."
4,Classic for a reason,"I'm truly astounded that anyone could give this album 1 star. No, it's not their best work, but it's still a classic, and has probably one of the top 10 best rock songs of all time (the title track). ""Hotel California"", ""New Kid In Town"", and ""Life in the Fast Lane"" are all great songs that have earned their way into the popular music canon. ""Wasted Time"" is also an excellent song. ""The Last Resort"", the last song, is an epic, beautifully-written song about (according to Don Henley) ""how the West was lost"". It's probably the most beautiful and most underrated Eagles song.The reason I can't, in good conscience, give this album 5 stars is because of ""Pretty Maids All In A Row"" and ""Try And Love Again"". I suspect that these songs being on the album were a compromise that the band struck up internally so that bandmembers other than Henley or frey could get a chance to sing lead and write songs for the album. Those two songs are really not up to usual Eagles standards."
5,An Ironic Effort and Their Best to Date,"Since '76, the Eagles would never match the success of Hotel California. It's theme is presented through story-based songs. It actually wasn't as much a change of pace for the Eagles as '74's ""On the Border"". It's more soft-rock than the older, country-fixated Eagles. Other than, Pink Floyd's The Wall, Michael Jackson's Thriller, and U2's Joshua Tree, this is a rock n' roll classic.Some may criticize Hotel's title track for being overplayed but it is has a timeless sense to it. Here, the Eagles focus on song quality and this album shows this indeed. Standout cuts include :Life in the Fast LaneNew Kid In TownWasted Time"
4,came right when i was expecting it to.....,thank you very much....i still havent gotten this yet...i moved and my brother is holding it for me...i am sure it is perfect..thanks again
4,You Can Checkout But You Can Never Stop Listening,"The first three tracks take any classic rock fan on a great escape through the immortalized American dream. As Henley once said ""Every band has their peak. This was ours."" Although Victim of Love is a well respected ballad, the remaining songs were written/directed essentially on the `get this album out on the charts and let Billboard sign the singing' aptitude. Unfortunately, most every great rock band of the past has had no choice but to age their stage to the typical Greatest Hits CD of today. Nevertheless, Hotel California has remained a studio decadence throughout the years - no lost guitar picks about it."
3,"this was ok,","the chemistry was ok but when they actually did kiss or have sex, it somehow disappeared.the heroine is just too nice i should say, and the hero was not very memorable. i skimmed through most of the book."
5,I loved it!,"This was my first Jacuie D'Alessandro romance and I found it delightful. Hayley Albright was a charming heroine and her family made the story especially heartwarming. Stephen Barrett, Lord Glenfield, a.k.a. Stephen Barrettson, definitely could be the ""dolt"" that his sister claimed he was, yet when it really counted he became the romantic hero. The story had such a great ending that I didn't want to let this couple and their charming family go..."
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!,"I can't say enough about this book with its' beautiful and different story line. I fell in love with Hayley's 2 ""servants"", her dear sweet Aunt and even the ""Hellhounds"". What a delightful book and I found the meanings to the flowers so interesting I have kept them. No depressing love, hate relationship. Thank you so much Jacquie and look forward to more books like this. You certainly have a lot of fans like me too."
5,An awesome book,"I couldn't believe it when I found out that this was her first book. It made me want to research how to get a hold of her. I found her website which led me here! I wanted to let everyone know that I have read thousands and thousands of romance novels and this one rates WAAAY up there. I was seriously hooked by page 4! You can't beat that! It is a great read. You really get to know and like all the characters, including the household staff!!!! A must read!"
3,Mostly enjoyable but weak ending.,"The story is going along swimmingly until the end.CAUTION SPOILERS:The author ruins it with two events. First, she has the hero say cruel things which he doesn't mean to his love interest which sends her away. Second, someone is trying to kill him, so the police help him set a trap for the killer, but the hero doesn't follow the plan and wanders off alone and gets shot. Having the hero do stupid things because the author cannot think of a reasonable way to create conflict or crisis ruins the book. The only reason I rated this as a 3 (for ok) was because I did enjoy the majority of the story, until the end.DATA:Sexual language: mild. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: 1820 London and nearby areas. Copyright: 1999. Genre: regency romance.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Jacquie D'Alessandro books, see my 4 star review of ""Sleepless at Midnight"" posted 6/19/08."
5,"Loved the Heroine, LOVED the Hero!","What a wonderful book this is! I was going to give my sister my copy to read, but after finishing Red Roses (I stayed up all night to finish it!), I told my sister she'd have to buy her own because my copy was going right onto my keeper shelf. The characters were REAL people. No cardboard people in THIS book. Hayley was a strong, loving heroine, and Stephen was marvelous. The poor man, in spite of having every material advantage, had never known love in his entire life--until Hayley and her family came along. I loved how the author took a sad, lonely, cynical man and let him grow into someone I fell in love with. He had his flaws, but the strength of this family's love showed him a new way. It was wonderful from the first page to the last. It made me feel so good, I'm still smiling! If I could give it FIFTY stars I would!!"
2,Very good beginning.....then I dunno what the author was thinking,"I love the book up until they slept together and then the heroine turned in mush and the hero, I wanted to whack him in the head a few times. Yes I understand that he wanted to protect the heroine but then after the villain was capture he should have went right away to the heroine and grovel at her feet. I wanted to whack the hero a few more times after the heroine saved him the second time.What really saved the book in the end was the sweet little girl. She is so adorable. The little thing really made it worth finishing the book.Beginning deserves a 5 starHeroine 4 starsHero 1 star wasn't much of a hero the last half of the book:**:.'.**'Little girl 10 stars. :**:.'.**'"
4,Fabulous New Author!,This book was recommended to me from a friend and I am very happy I took her advice. It is a refreshingly witty and charming to a fault.I look forward to Whirlwind Wedding and future reads from this talented author!
3,"Loved the first part, but latter...","I loved the first part of the book when they were getting to know each other, and the way Stephen learned there was more to life then order, discipline and loneliness. The murder story was predictable. I hated the way Stephen treated Hayley when she came to him at the party. And I wish he wouldn't wait for so long before asking her forgiveness. I loved the secondary characters:) And I loved the bouquet he brought her in the end :)All in all, this was a very entertaining and quite satisfying read :)"
5,One to watch!,This book will capture your heart! I'll be looking for more from Jacquie D'Alessandro.
5,ITS COOL PHAT HOOKS AND FULL OF COMEDY WITH MUCH GAME,IT MAY BE THE TYPICAL FLAVA BUT IT IS WITH A TWIST A BOMB TWIS
5,I'd Rather Give You My Money...,"If you haven't listened to this album, get out! There is no need for you to read these reviews! This c.d. is off the track man. The songs will make you wet your pants in laughter, and check your wallet cause your baby's mama mighta just dipped in there.""I wanna go home"", was on the Eastsidaz movie(hint hint) where he freestyles the lines to Snoop. Bow Wow!On ""Doe Doe and a Skunk"", he caught me laughing with wonder, on how he got,"" Now I'm about to get gone, after I'm g'd up from the feet up, now roll this weed up like car heat up, speed up with the beat up and roll."" within 4 seconds and not break wind or something.""Fly Fo Life"" is hilarious, and so are, ""Why You Bullsh**tin'""and ""I'd Rather Give You""I feel that the best track by far though is ""If You Stay Ready"". It shows his true character, and that is simply that he himself is a character.The rest...buy it and hear it, it is worth not buying a bottle tonight and hearing yourself to become drunk.One."
4,Suga Free's beats are addicting: 4.5 stars,"Suga Free comes out strong on ""Street Gospel."" If you love G-Funk and humorous rhymes about hood life and pimpin', this is one to consider. Doe Doe And A Skunk has the best beat on the album. It has a smooth beat with excellent rhyming with a relaxing tropical background beat. Dip Da is a dope track showing Suga Free's more serious side dealing with issues in his family and the hood. It has a really hardcore beat and excellent rhyming. Don't sleep on this album."
4,Great but disheartening book,"Kozol does a great job of capturing the horrors of segregated public education in Boston, and the disservice that it did to the children who lived through it. What troubled me the most about this book is that many of the statistics cited by Kozol have not changed in the intervening 45 years. What I hope has changed is the attitudes of white teachers toward students of color. The most horrifying aspect of this book was the way in which even self-identified ""liberal"" teachers viewed their young black charges with such loathing."
3,Basic Skills For The New Arbitrator,"While this book provides some very good basic information, especially for a new arbitrator, some of Mr. Goodman's ideas are radically different from the practice of most main stream arbitrators. Certainly the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and the American Arbitration Association would disagree with Mr. Goodman's statement that ""No reasons are given for the award"" when a decision is rendered. I personally do not know any arbitrator who does not clearly state the basis for a decision/award. Also, it is not common practice, and certainly not good advice for a novice, to hold the rendered decision hostage until payment for the arbitration service is received. The author is addressing ""basic skills"" for new arbitrators and could mislead them in these and other opinions stated in this book which, incidentally, I believe is over-priced for its size and paper bound format."
1,It's horrible!!!,"This cd it's the worst thing that I've ever listen in my life, i can't believe that this trash is in the cd's stores, i hope that Bon Jovi realese something really wonderful for the next to erase this shame!!!"
4,Excellent webcam,"For the price, I can't imagine a better camera. The technical details accurately described the performance of the camera. My main intention was to use it with Skype and it works with Skype with no problems. Setup-to-operation time was a few minutes. Note that there is no built in mic. The literature does not say there is one, but so many cameras come with them that this might be easily missed by a potential buyer.One caution. The distributed software (used with Windows 2000) contains a program to operate the camera remotely. That program contains a file (cmdow.exe) which has the potential to allow unwanted, remote control of one's computer. The program is not necessary for the operation of the camera."
1,Ice Tea and Roses,"I totally agree with Nancy Wiseman. I couldn't believe what I was reading - so many words spelled incorrectly and words that were obviously the wrong words. After plowing through it, I found there was no ending! I thought pages had been torn out. Then I looked for a page that told when Book 2 would be coming out. Nothing. Joan Hanover"
2,"That Cat's Not Roaring, It's Yawning!...","Horror icon Donald Pleasence (Halloween 1 and 2, Raw Meat, Alone In The Dark) is big-game hunter extraordinaire, Axel McGregor in this non-creepy, sleep-inducer. McGregor is so obsessed w/ a man-eating black leopard, that he has it captured and brought to his private island so he can hunt it. All is well until McGregor's family (including the lovely Nancy Kwan) pays a surprise visit, unaware of the danger they're in. Unfortunately, what could / should have been a tense, ferocious story of survival is actually a bland test of endurance (for the viewer). It was hard to keep my eyes open..."
2,NOT MUCH TO ROAR ABOUT,"NIGHT CREATURE is one of those trademark late 70s movies that moves so slow it becomes uncomfortable waiting for something to happen. And even when it does, it is so poorly filmed and edited, you don't really see much of what's going on. Add the wearisome storyline of a great hunter who loves hunting more than his two daughters, bring them together on a deserted island with a deadly black leopard and talk the audience to death. That's basically all NIGHT CREATURE accomplishes. Donald Pleasance is ludicrously inept as Axel McGregor, who brings the captured leopard to his island to kill it; and Nancy Kwan fares little better as one of his daughters. Dull and tedious, little to recommend."
4,"Comfy, cute, and soft","Soft sheets and very comfy. I'd call the flannel average. I don't see them holding up for a long time, but they'll do the job for a year or two."
4,These sheets are great!,I purchased 2 sets of these for my daughters who share a room. We also got the matching duvet covers. They washed up very nicely and are still soft. I think they will wear very well. They love the cute pattern and I loved the price!
4,Scary but good.,"Sling Blade is a pretty shocking and intense film. Billy Bob Thornton is unrecognizable in this gritty and challenging role. His character has just been released from a mental ward and he befriends a young, sweet boy he has troubled family issues. Sling Blade is a slow cooker kind of film, he starts off slow but the last hour is just pure intensity and madness. John Ritter also stars and he's quite good as well, very under-rated and quiet performance. Gotta see this one, enjoy!"
5,IS ALREADY A CLASSIC,"The only bad thing I can say about this movie is that director/actor/writer Billy Bob Thornton (BBT) will never top it. Watch the included extras on Disc II of this release (over three hours worth) and you'll see that BBT agrees with that prediction. ""Sling Blade"" is simply a GREAT movie, already a classic. It is better each time I watch it."
5,A Five-Star Production!,"Billy Bob Thornton delivers another powerful and thought provoking script and acting with the making of Sling Blade. I didn't know what to expect at first when my husband suggested buying this DVD. He had read reviews, but I had not.Boy, was I surprised to find such an outstanding picture. It really brings one back to the truth that you can't judge a book by its cover. And I'm not talking about the title and cover of the DVD, but about the characters in the movies. The character of Karl had been judged by society and suffered the consequences. If this is the way the world operates, we are all susceptible to being judged or judging someone we consider to be 'beneath' us.Buy this movie. You won't regret it. Excellect script. Excellent performance.Gail Gupton, Author: 'The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment', and 'Seekers of Truth'."
2,sling blade,"The movie came in a timely manner, but unfortunately we didn't get to watch the whole movie because there were to many glitches in the first thirty minutes ,so we just turned it off."
3,"Wonderful Film, but Director's Cut Version Detracts from Original Release","As others have done a fine job of reviewing the film, I will limit this review to to the subject of this ""director's cut"" version. I liked the original theatrical release enormously. Yet when I viewed this ""director's cut"" I was disappointed. In my view, the added scenes detracted from the original and added nothing, and what was edited out took much away from the movie we all saw in the theaters. Having said that, the other bonus features included in this two disc set are excellent with lots of interviews and in depth behind the scenes."
4,Sling Blade,This is my husbands favorite movie. It is very a compeling story. It keeps your interest and you feel for the characters.
3,touching,"I think that ""Sling blade"" is a rather trivial film (its characters did not seem to me to be fully developed, etc.), but it is not overly pretentious and it is touching. The film is slow and, apart from one truly intense and violent scene, so quiet, that you feel restful while watching it. I recommend you to see it."
5,BILLY BOBS BEST!,"There's no doubt, this is Billy Bob Thortons best performance!This is the first movie I ever saw him in. I thought he reallywas mentally challenged, and his face really looked like that.I didn't recognise him in his next movie, because I thought hereally looked the way he did in Sling Blade! Why this moviedidn't win many awards, is rediculous! The story, the acting,and everything about this movie, make it a true classic film!"
5,Finally get all the jokes ...,"Forever I have heard ""French fried potatoes"" in that low voice and didn't get the joke but now I understand.I loved this movie. The only thing that I noticed was that the boys accent was more of a West Florida/Alabama accent, the moms was more Arkansas. But I suppose they just assume that people just hear ""bumpkin"" and wouldn't notice. It only detracted for a moment as I tried to decipher what wasn't right.Watch this movie!"
5,About Sling Blade with Billy Bob Thornton,"If you wish to get laughs that you'll never forget, buy this movie and what Bill Bob Thornton make your sides hurt from laughter. Plus, you'll see one of the best acting performance from a man ever in his lifetime. You'll not recognise Billy playing the role of a mentally challenged individual. WOW what a performance. If you don't buy this and WATCH the movie it's your loss. SO BUY THIS A SEE A FIVE STAR MOVIE. YOU'LL WATCH THIS MANY TIMES. I PROMISE!!!"
1,"I tired, I really did","I desperately wanted to like this movie. I am a big fan of so called ""independent"" films, and given the horrid stuff that mainstream Hollywood churns out the reviews I read and heard of ""Sling Blade"" immediately put it on my list of movies I wanted to see, and I first saw it in a theater shortly after it opened.Yes, first saw it. I have seen this film three times, each time desperately trying to figure out why so many people have gone completely gaga over it. The plot is not only too simplistic, but breathtakingly implausible, the whole thing is just so full of southern cliches it becomes more and more painful to sit through as the movie progresses, and the performances are strictly hollow, with no depth or originality.I have simply just given up trying to figure out what the fuss was all about. I guess it is just time to move on."
5,You will never forget Carl.,"I've seen this movie three times and now I'm buying it - I know I'll never tire of it. I think of myself as something of a movie connoisseur, and this is one of my favorites. It is such an interesting insight into the human mind, the grey area between what's right and wrong, and how we treat and judge one another. Billy Bob Thornton proves his brilliance in so many ways through this film. I am truly impressed."
5,An Excellent film...very touching performance.,"Billy Bob Thornton's ""Slingblade"" easily lives up to the praises it's received. A beautifully scripted film that touches the heart of the viewer and entertains from beginning to end. Thornton's spellbounding portrayal of Karl is untouchable. The viewer immediately falls in love with Karl's compassion and simplicity. Excellent movie...see it now!!"
3,Impressive debut,"Judging from the previous reviews, this movies is either loved or hated. Considering the fact that it was Thornton's debut as a director, I would say it was very well done. Yes, the storyline was rather thin, but it somehow reflected the mind of Karl, from who's standpoint we view the film. Furthermore, much of the credit should go to the fact that Thornton tackled a sensitive issue, which gives any film a social relevance. I thought many reviewers spoke about the film as an evening entertainment that somehow didn't work for them (which is fine with me). The fact that the American prison and rehab systems are becoming the sole producers of criminals and misfits, made me watch this movie in a different perspective."
5,was a gift,the video was a gift so i havent watched it but it did make someone else awful happy and for that we are grateful. came in a timely manner so i will just give you an A+. thnkyou! we looooooooooove a good price!
5,A Beautiful Facet,"The worth of a diamond has more to do with the cut, and color, and the way each facet is cut to bring out the true quality of the stone. Sling Blade is truly a gem of higher quality. The underlying moral plane proves that a film maker can give the answer in the question he or she poses. A wonderful suspension of my disbelief."
1,Horrible,"Geez! What a bowser of a movie! Retarded Karl is released from a mental hospital where he has spent time for killing his mother and her lover years earlier. He then befriends a young boy and defends him and his mother from her abusive boyfriend. THAT'S IT! Naturally this one recieved raves from critics who salivated over Billy Bob Thorton whose performance consists of little more than an under bite, a slouch, and monotone grunts about ""french fried taters."" Besides, does ANYONE believe that Karl would come up with a howler of a line like ""that boy lives inside his own heart, and that's an awfully big place?""Then there is the utterly one dimensional character of the boyfriend and the one note performance by singer Dwight Yokum.A dreadful little movie."
2,A waste of time if you have the VHS,"First, I have to say that I absolutely love this movie. I bought the VHS when it was first released as a rental copy. The DVD version of this film states that this is a ""widescreen"" or ""letterboxed"" presentation. I must say however that what they call ""widescreen"" is little more than the original VHS presentation with black bars cutting even more from the film! This is a ridiculous concept to me. The film on this DVD has been chopped on all sides from the theatrical version."
4,"A simply riviting, startling and emotional film!","This sleeper film and its characters can be compared to the southern characters and story of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"".The characterizations are very real and the story is stark and dramatic. Obviously those who hated the film have no sense of emotion whatsoever. I guess you either love or hate this film.If you like films that don't resort to gratuitious violence and thrive off of shear emotion than this will be a great addition to your DVD collection."
4,Your madula oblangatta will hurt for days.,"This classic would've gotten 5 stars, but hearing the late great J.T. Walsh use the phrase ''uncircumcized penis'' made me puke up my french fried taters with mustard. l thought John Ritter's character was really funny. Not funny as in queer, funny as in ha-ha."
3,OK movie,This movie was ok. I bought it for my mother who was ranting about it and finally sat down and watched most of it. Overall its not a bad movie more of an ok movie but I wasnt really into it. Its kind of slow paced. And Billy Bob thorton does do a good job playing this character I still find myself liking him better as a crazy jerk.
1,Fantastic,"Arrived promptly. It actually is the 2-disc collector's edition with special features which some sell for much more. It's a ground breaking, wonderful film."
1,Groan,"Whenever I hear somebody proclaim that Sling Blade ""is one of the best movies I have ever seen"" I immediately conclude that they must not have seen very many movies.Face it folks, this movie is a dud. Over rated, and hyped beyond belief. The story is totally implausible, the acting strictly one note. That this has received so many rave reviews is a sad commentary on the state of American cinema."
5,One of my grandma's favorites!,I brought this as a gift for my grandma's birthday! She loves this movie! So if she's happy I'm happy also!
2,Excessively Overrated,"Good Lord was this an over-hyped movie or what? I mean it's OK, but COME ON! Some OK performances, but very very simplistic."
1,Siskel & Ebert dropped the ball here - AVOID!!!!!,"What a stupid movie. What a shameless Oscar bid by Billy Bob Thorton. What an idiotic story. What an excremental script. And how stupid does Billy Bob & Co. think we are? I mean, a key plot development is the main character meeting a small boy, explaining that he just got out of a mental home where he was imprisoned for killing some people immediately after which the small boy invites him to come live with him. A second key plot is the small boy's mother being told all this and not having any problem with this arrangement. HEL-LO?! I just cannot say enough bad things about this movie and its painfully obvious attempt to use the now almost cliched ""noble retarded character"" to show how terrible ""normal"" people are. BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD."
1,Sorry,"I have seen this film three times and I still can't figure out what all the fuss is about. The plot is contrived, the characters strictly cardboard, and the acting is just plain awful. Violence is promoted as the answer to our problems and there are so many southern cliches here one loses count very quickly. Pseudo intellectuals will tell you that this is a masterpiece, but in reality the emperor has no clothes."
1,Oh my!,"This is a movie with a good message, but it is so full of foul language that we will not watch it again!"
1,I ordered swing blade and it would not play. I got ripped off. Same with Hang over.,I ordered swing blade and it would not play. I got ripped off. Same with Hang over.
2,Only Average at Best...,"I'm sorry but i dont know what all the hype was about with this flick. Although the acting was superb, the plot was thin, and frankly i didnt really care for billy bob's character. The ""climax"" was entirely anti-climatic."
5,Billy Bob is quite gifted,This is a gritty drama about innocence & purity & triumph over the cruelty of human kind. Mr. Thorton is Quite a talented man! There are some serious issues of abuse in this movie. It's not one for the kids.
4,If only....,"I wish I could rate this DVD a 5. I really do! This movie is incredible. The DVD overall is not though. Admittedly it was released a while ago and since then the concept of Special Features has become a bit more of a standard, but for the price on this disc I personally would like a little bit more. If you can find a deal (used, etc.) this DVD for the movie alone is one that everyone should have. Enjoy!"
3,Interesting but...,"This was an interesting film but I kept waiting for something to actually HAPPEN (aside from what happened at the end, which we can all see coming from 1,000 miles away). Maybe I just couldn't totally appreciate (enough) a simple film with an easy-to-understand plot...they don't make those anymore! :)BBT's performance/transition to Karl (Carl?) was brilliant, of course. But Dwigh Yokum (sp?) was the REAL surprise. Wow. He should have been nominated for best supporting actor."
1,Quite possibly the most over rated movie of all time!,"Geez! What a bowser of a movie! Retarded Karl is released from a mental hospital where he has spent time for killing his mother and her lover years earlier. He then befriends a young boy and defends him and his mother from her abusive boyfriend. THAT'S IT! Naturally this one recieved raves from critics who salivated over Billy Bob Thorton whose performance consists of little more than an under bite, a slouch, and monotone grunts about ""french fried taters."" Besides, does ANYONE believe that Karl would come up with a howler of a line like ""that boy lives inside his own heart, and that's an awfully big place?""Then there is the utterly one dimensional character of the boyfriend and the one note performance by singer Dwight Yokum.A dreadful little movie."
2,"False advertising, mediocre product","The board was initially advertised as 36""x60"", it actually measures at 36"" x 48"". The seller misrepresented the actual size of the product. Had I known the REAL dimensions I would not have purchased the product as $79.99 is on the higher end for this size board in comparison with other 36"" x 48"" boards. There are already signs of ghosting with this product as well. The only plus is the wood frame which is somewhat aesthetically pleasing but I didn't buy a white board for looks...."
3,Way too big,"I'm not sure what you would need something this big for but we bought to hang our infants swing and there's no way it's going to work. These brackets are huge... The S hook on the swing was way to small to go into the rings of the bracket... If you're hanging something for an adult swing this is probably fine. The swing we bought showed this as the brackets people bought with it, I hate returning things and looks like I'm going to have to :("
3,"Product, alone.","I don't know why, but I was under the impression that this came with mounting hardware. That is not the case. The hangers are all that arrived, in the box. I'll be dropping probably another $5 or more on hardware for each swing, now, too."
2,General Introduction - Not Focussed on Topic,"Maybe it's just me, but when I purchase a book entitled Inside RRAS, I expect it to cover RRAS thoroughly and in depth. However, this book does not really touch on RRAS until approximately halfway through. If you are a relative newbie to remote access issues and need to know, for example, what a modem is, then buy this book. If you know anything at all about remote access, and you're looking for some in-depth information on RRAS, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. There is nothing whatsoever that is in-depth about this book. It is an introduction, and an unfocussed one at that."
2,No in-depth information about RRAS,"If you are just getting started to learn about RAS and RRAS, this book is for you; however if you need in-depth information about remote access services forget about this book! This book can serve as an introduction for beginners, not more."
5,Brian Scores Again!,This second installment in the E-Branch series is another example of Brian's genius. I am currently enthralled by this reading.Lookin forward to the final installment (I hope he will consider continuing).
4,It's about darn time!,Geez! I'm glad Jake can finally access the MC! I found the book better than the first with more action and suspense. I was thinking Lumley was losing his zing for this series but he won me back. VERY good reading.
5,The Whamphyri are back!,"This is true Brian Lumley. He is successfully able to weave yet another tale in the continuing saga of the Whamphyri and E-Branch. As usual this is a book you'll be unable to put down. Lumley grabs your attention and keeps it. You'll be sorry when you reach the last page. Let's hope there are many, many more Lumley tales of the Whamphyri, Necroscope and E-Branch in the future."
4,McConnell Delivers,"The best media tie-in novels take the world of the television show and enlarge it, making it richer and taking it places the series couldn't go because of time or budget constraints. McConnell has done that brilliantly in this novel with an ingenious Big Bad wrapped in a delicious character-driven plot cooked up to delight any fan of Wesley Wyndam-Price. Wes' characterization is dead-on and runs deep; I could hear Alexis Denisof's voice in my head for each line. This is a story and a villain that are particularly Wesley's, and it is wonderful to watch the interactions between him and the rest of the team. McConnell has a deft hand with dialogue and her word snapshots capture the show's visual feel. The story, which you've read about in the reviews above this one, draws the reader in, and the result is a very satisfying read."
4,Super Reader,"A quite well done Angel novel. An old Watcher school acquaintance of Wesley's turns up to go to a rare mystical book auction. Angel thinks it would be a good idea for Wes to check it out too, as Cordelia has had a related vision about a teenager acquiring such things.When they do, Wesley gets his hands on a book called the Red Compendium, that has miscellaneous spells from many different authors.To Wesley's cost, he finds out why. A demon in the book called the Bookwyrm draws him inside the tome, and tries to eat him.Those on the outside must try and stop it."
2,Cheap feel & Look for the Price,"After reading Consumer Reports high rankings of the AT&T products, I purchased this one. Big mistake. The phone had a terribly cheap feel and look. The one I bought from Amazon arrived already scratched on the handset and base. The silver paints just rubbed right off in shipment. The screen was chintzy and that's being kind. When I talked into the handset, it sounded like I was talking into a bucket. I bought another Uniden like my last phone and returned this one."
4,"Not perfect, but a big help","If you suffer from IBS, leaning toward constipation, these tablets are a big help in ""getting things moving."" You made need an additional boost, like magnesium oxide, but psyllium is a great product. Many stores sell it in powder or some other loose form; it's much more convenient to have the caplets. You do need to take quite a few every day to get help, but again, it's easier to swallow capsules than ingesting it in some other way."
3,"From an academic standpoint, a pleasure read, but perfectly fine.","It's funny to see readers responding with such emphatic contempt for this book and its author on the same page as readers who have such praise. Obviously we all have our biases. The author is not excluded from that commonality, nor does he claim to be. The book is not too difficult to read, but is well documented. By society's standards, he lacks no credentials and quotes no one who does. The findings described carry obvious implications, and the author draws connections and explanations from the Bible. From an academic standpoint, this is a pleasure read, which Christians will probably enjoy and evolutionists and non-Christians will probably despise. However, that doesn't deny its content legitimacy. It obviously fed my curiosity. It could have been written in a more tactful argumentative tone without losing its Biblical emphasis."
1,"Ludicrous, failed attempt at logic.","Ludicrous, an absolute failed attempt to convince the reader of anything logical. ""Evidence"" is presented that just isn't true. A waste of time, and a waste of money. One does not need to believe that man walked with ""Dinosaurs"" to believe in God. This book is merely an attempt to make money, just like everything else the author does. Even most serious, ""Christian Scientists"" disagree with this fraud."
4,Stories Within Stories,Interesting idea about the evil queen running stories. Of course the good witch wins in the end. Not Pratchett's very best but certainly worth reading if you like Disc World!
4,Fairytales a la Discworld,"In a weird twist of fate, I (the innocent reader) picked up this Discworld novel soon after reading Mercedes Lackey's Fairy Godmother--and found it to be a twist on similar ideas. Witches Abroad was published first (copyright 1991, compared to Lackey's 2004), and neither is in any way a copy of the other. Think retelling, reimagining, perhaps even another form of The Tradition...But here we have a dead Fairy Godmother, who leaves three witches to rectify a story gone bad. On the way, they encounter all sorts of odd effects from an evil godmother intent on making stories come true--including (my absolute favorite) a house that drops unexpectedly on the reinforced hat of Nanny Ogg, whereupon a crowd of dwarves appear with a strange urge to take her red boots.Of course, this being Terry Pratchett, things get much, much odder, and there will be strange incidents involving pumpkins, zombies, card sharks, and even gumbo before the tale is through."
3,Fairy tales will never be the same again,"This book is not one of the better ones in Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, although the Witches series as a whole is a little weak. On the other hand, a weak book by Pratchett is still a great book. Witches Abroad is about fairy tales and the hold that they have over people. Without going into details, I will say that after reading this book you will have new-found sympathy for the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood. I recommend this book to all Pratchett fans and to readers who like fairy tales, although after this book you will never read a fairy tale the same way again."
3,Just Another one,"All in all not the best book from Terry. I bought it just because it was a Pratchett and I'm happy about miss weatherwax stuff, always a must. In the other hand the plot is a litle too much for the result, I should counsel some other pratchett if you are buying your first pratchett, like ""GUARDS GUARDS"". But if you are a Pratchett fan this is good fun."
3,If You Like the Discworld Witches You'll Love It,"The discworld stories dealing with witches are not among my favorites but I still liked this one. It is an average Prachett story, which is high praise. The youngest witch Magrat Garlick becomes a fairy godmother and along with two other witches goes to help her new ward. It drags toward the end, the trip to discworld's New Orlean is the best part. But you can't go wrong with the series and you'll like this one although there are many better examples of Prachett's work."
1,error in kindle transcription,i do believe there is an error in the kindle transcription. theres an odd message saying ??? see text m\s and some numbers afterwards. great book otherwise. flagging this as 1 star to get attention to the error. feel free to delete once fixed
2,Sadly Dull.,"I'm nearly positive that everyone has been in the horrible (awkward/nerve-wracking/uncomfortable) social situation where everyone but you is laughing uproariously at a joke that you just can't fathom why it would tickle anyone's funny bone.This is exactly how this book made me feel; hard for me to say, being a Pratchett fan and generally finding his books satirical hilarity.It took me three tries to finally read this entire book; reason being, it doesn't pick up until around page 165 - when faerie tales start coming true in typical Pratchett zany-ness. Even then, the dialogue is almost constant (rarely making sense) and leaving little room for plot. As a review in the front page of the book says, ""You can never pick up all the jokes he makes in one reading"". Sadly, this book left me never wanting to pick it up again. Alas, I'll never ""pick up"" on all those (possibly hilarious/possibly just as horrendous as I thought) jokes."
5,Soft look pictures,So far this filter works just as it says. I used it to shoot my garden fountains. Bought it to use on our Island trip.
3,Good for Women size 7 also,Purchased for my wife. She like them but they didn't seem to last as long as past Kayano shoes.
5,Weeeeee!,"BooooohBaaaah! phbbbbbbth! weeeee!I re-named all five of my children after the BoohbahsTHere is bobby ""zingzingzingBAH!""and little anne ""humBAH"" just to name a few....They have gained important life skills like the ability to sing their names, jump up and down, and for some reason, developed an adversion to ""comfy"" chairs of any sort.How strange.However, my childrens' ECSTATIC state has left me friends with all members of the large BoohBah family.I strongly recommend the purchase of this product as well as the avid participation in all of their excercises."
3,This show is not educational in the least,This show is designed to keep kids preoccupied while mom or dad file taxes or while the babysitter calls her friend on the phone. Boobah is entertainment for babies not educational at all. This show is nothing like sesame street(old school sesame street to be exact).I thought the purpose of educational television was to prepare children for school. At least that is what sesame street's original stated purpose was to prepare children for school.This show is entertainment under the guise of so called Educational Television.
5,My kids love the Boohbah squeakysocks,"I especially love that the dvd is so long (about an hour) and they cut out the look at what i can do part. My daughter loves to dance with the ""e.t.s"" as she calls them and the dvd arrived well before Easter (it was part of her gift) and was in excellent condition."
3,If you tell anyone...,"The review called ""Boohbah"" is EXACTLY what my brother would say. I like the show but... I'm 11. But if you tell anyone, I'll strangle you. Just kidding. I don't exactly ""like"" it, I think the boohbahs are colorful and the show's funny. (That's all!)"
1,Now showing in hell,"I guarantee that somewhere in the smoky, brimestone-reeking pits of hell, there is a 100-foot screen endlessly showing this brain remover to screaming sinners, tied down with their eyelids glued open.Don't condescend to your kids by showing them this; get them something like Blue's Clues that actually makes them use their heads for something besides a hair platform."
1,ACK,"Boobah are berry scary!!! I saw them on tv and I was thinking: ""what the crap ARE those??"" The show has NO educational content and is retarded. I'm not going to let my future children watch this."
4,It's all true,"The Idiots is one of the better genre-avoiding movies of recent times. Dark comedy slams straight into uncomfortable realism as director Lars von Trier and his dedicated cast commit to celluloide some truly unforgettable set-pieces in a narative that never once tells you how to react to what you are seeing.Von Trier is once again in top form, building on his already impressive filmography (his epic two-parter 'The Kingdom' was shown in weekly instalments on Australian TV recently; THE best thing around, roll on part III) to tell the story of another female character determined to see to the end of her decisions, however painful the consequences may be for the people around her.Bravo! to all involved."
1,Masterpiece? He wishes.,Horrible like most of his films. I hate him and his films. Pretentiousness person who makes pretentious overrated films. Hopefully history will make the shelf life of these films wither away just like all other terrible movies of the past.
3,SubZero,I enjoyed reading this book. Although it ended abruptly. Still recommend it. I would recommend more by this author Robert Walker.
5,M Butterfly,M Butterfly is a very captivating movie. I saw it once back in the 90s on HBO and had to own it. I've had it for a few weeks and I am about to watch it again today.The quality and condition of the movie arrival was superb. I love shopping with Amazon.
2,a prize winner,"We need a category of movie reviews called something like ""Worst Films With The Best Cast."" This movie would be a serious contender for the title. Irons is wonderful, and Ian Richardson is, as usual, a commanding figure on the screen. The direction is fine, and so is the music. But the plot! It is so absurd that you want to throw tomatoes. Here is a guy whose woman is giving him oral and anal sex, and in the concluding scenes he is stunned to discover that ""she"" is a man. Who would not have been fooled...except any intelligent person with good eyesight. In short: this movie is utterly ridiculous and by no means worth anyone's time. It should have won an award at Cannes."
3,Good Value Tool,"I have been using this Caliper for about 3 weeks now. It does a fairly good job. The consturction is lightweight and the thumb knob isn't as precise as something from Starrett, but the price is right. It is accurate and repeatable. I am satisfied with my purchase"
3,Not bad.,"Its a reasonable caliper. Its good to hundredths of an inch for metalwork and 1/64ths for woodworking. My only issue is the needle on mine was bent about the width of the needle blade itself between the fractional and decimal scales .. which means I have to rezero it for changing scales. If actual thousandths was wanted, the company should swap the locations of the fractional and decimal scales (which would be a reasonable thing to do regardless, considering the decimal scale has greater accuracy than the fractional 1/64ths). Swapping the scale locations would give the caliper accuracy to .001 instead of a mere .01(5). Still, not bad for the price."
5,Great book - for mavins and slide-curious dilettantes alike!,"Very satisfying and emminently accessible is this episode guide written by Brad Linaweaver... an actual writer who makes a living stringing words of fiction together into a coherent narrative. For a change!Linaweaver romps through the show like an eager puppy, picking up scents that most would overlook, leading us readers on a wild hunt, and occasionally even marking his territory (as all working hounds do), letting his own wonderfully bizarre opinions splatter across the page.It's a hell of a read. Very highly recommended."
1,Not Worth It,"I was very disappointed by this work. Not only does the author seem vastly incompetent and egotistical, but even the pictures were not good.I would also like to note that another reviewer (J. Neil) is incorrect. This book was well documented in public throughout it's many delays, and was first listed as ""Sliders: Parallel Universes"" in several catalogues for pre order (such as Diamond: Previews). These orders were subsequently cancelled and the book delayed (though I can not see a reason for any delay...could this book have been worse at some point?).If there is any industry conspirarcy going on here, it must be J. Neil taking up for his friend...even if it means bending the truth."
5,Best available introductory text on abacus or soroban,"I do not believe this title is in print, but it's worth looking for! I certainly did. This is the clearest explanation of how to use the abacus that I have come across. Particularly good are the chapters on multiplication and division, which are not quite as straightforward operations as are addition and subtraction.Don't confuse this with Takashi's follow up book, Advanced Abacus: Japanese Theory and Practice - it's what the title says, more advanced. It deals, as I recall, with such items as fractions, and even square roots. Of interest nonetheless, it will not teach you multiplication and division. (After a 50 year hiatus, I decided to finally learn those 2 operations in addition to addition and subtraction, which I had taught myself as a young child!)"
3,Sling Blade - not exactly what I expected,"Listening to this soundtrack, I was somewhat disappointed to find tracks not played in the movie (""Blue Waltz"", Soul Dressing"", ""Smothered in Hugs"")on the album. What should have been on the album was the track that helped create the atmosphere of the scene when Karl revisits the shed he inhabited and the delapidated house and the father that rejected him. That track, in my opinion, set up the emotion experienced by Karl when he returns to that cruel place of his upbringing.However, I am pleased that ""Asylum"" made it to the album as well as ""Shenandoah"" and ""Orange Kay"". In all, I think this album is average without the vital track that SHOULD HAVE been included."
1,sling blade,"WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CD, WAS TO ME NOTHING LIKE THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE. I LOOKED SO FOWARD TO GETTING IT BECAUSE OF LOVING THE MOVIE SO MUCH. THIS CD SOUND TRACK SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT AFTER THE MOVIE WAS MADE. NOW IM STUCK WITH IT."
4,definately worth a look,"This is the first South Korean film that I have seen. I do not know if this is standard for what the nation puts out, or if this is a superior Korean movie. What I do know is that I thoroughly enjoyed Shiri.The basic plot of the movie is that there is an assassin named Hee taking out top officials of the South Korean government. Two of the top agents in S.K. are ordered to find and stop her. At the same time, an elite military group from North Korea has stolen a shipment of CTX, an extremely explosive liquid. Mix in a perfectly woven love story between one of the agents and a woman named Hyun, and you have one of the best action movies that should have been made in America but never was.While some may find parts of this movie cliché, there is very little in action cinema right now that is not cliché in some way. This movie is worth seeing for any fan of action movies, or of movies dealing with intelligence agents, assassins and spies. Excellent movie."
1,this movie sucked,"This movie is no action movie at all. There are certain action sequences which are so poorly shot (jerkey camera work) that they'll give you vertigo. Nor are the actino scenes even remotely believable--numerous times there are 16 highly trained south korean soldiers firing automatic weapons who can't hit a n. korean secret agent w/ a pistol in close quarters? good god, if this was all the rage in korea as an axn movie, hollywood can sleep well at night."
1,zzzzzzzz,"Hey all ! I highly do not recommend this movie. First I can not understand how this movie shattered the box office? Is this really the best that a Korean film can offer?I already know that no is the answer. The movie was so boring i found myself fast forwarding through the so called action scenes. Anytime there is action the director chose to use the violent shaking of the camera technique. All that does is make you feel dizzy and confused. This movie introduces nothing new and is not unique in any way . At least in this movie its still possible to dodge automatic weapon fire from 20 M-16s , avoid being blown up by diving towards the camera in slow motion, and stop bombs from exploding alwasy at the last second! yeah for over hyped movies !"
3,Action-packed and suspenseful...,"I just finished watching this spectacular film. I won't go into what's already been said about this movie except that Shiri does rival all the major Hollywood blockbuster action flicks in terms of production and action. It even beat Titanic at the box office in its home country of South Korea! And all for a budget of $5 million! Certain scenes of the movie will keep you riveted to the screen as well as leave you in suspense! The plot involves a group of North Korean military operatives who steal a top secret explosive and plan to use it at a reunification soccer game between the two Koreas. It's up to two South Korean agents to stop the operatives from carrying out their devious plan. It's gets a little more complicated at first as there is also a romance with one of the agents involved, but it's makes perfect sense later on, and I'll leave it at that. Any way, this is a pretty darn good action film! Three and a half stars."
4,Kissingurami,"I have to admit this movie is a bit more slow paced than I had expected, but it's no snoozer! It keeps you interested with little bits of flashback and coincedences. They really try to give you the entire ""picture"" of the relationships in the movie. It's not my favorite Korean movie, but like I said it kept me interested and I did really enjoy it.For more viewing of Korean Cinema I also suggest ""Old Boy"" for a crazy thriller and ""The Host"" for action/sci-fi.***Also those of you who watch ""Lost"" on ABC will see a familiar face; Yunjin Kim who is Sun Kwon."
3,chicks n guns,"First off, I agree with a previous reviewer that the cover is very deceptive and has absolutly nothing to do with this movie. It's just a selling ploy. Which is actually not a bad idea considering it may reach a larger audience. This movie has some extreme violence in it (excessive blood splatering, an exploding chick), but overall it is a great guy movie. There is some lovey-dovey stuff in it too. Nothing new or origional, but still fun, suspenseful and entertaining. Rent it before you buy it. The DVD has some nice extras."
4,Good Story With A Few Flaws,"The primary plot was well thought out and enough of a mystery to keep you engrossed. There were a few technical flaws with regard to weapon handling and scenarios that were a bit over the top but nothing that made the film unwatchable. Overall, I liked the acting, the storyline, and the production quality. I'd recommend this for fans of intrigue with a bit of action drama thrown in for good measure."
4,korean art,"this was the very 1st korean movie i ever saw. right from the start i was hooked, and ever since then i had a love for korean cinema. this movie was filled with great action and suspence. plus learning things about the kissing gurami fish was very interresting to. shiri is definetly 1 of my fav female assasins i ever saw. very worth ur time."
3,"Rave reviews do not equal a hit, or even a great movie.","First of all I will say I liked this movie. However, I do not feel it lives up to the hype that the other columnists are stating. I do think this is a movie worth watching, once. The first thing I will do with this movie now htat I have it, is sell it. Any bidders?"
3,Brutal Beauty - Deadly Aim,"North Korea's 8th Special Forces train highly effective, ruthless, and deadly agents that operate within South Korea's borders. The most lethal of them all is a female sniper, Hee, whose identity has been revealed to the South Korean secret service. It seems like Hee is stalking two South Korean agents, Ryu and Lee, and somehow she is constantly two steps before them. However, this time it seems like Hee has made an error and has left a track behind, but the real question is why? Shiri is a suspenseful tale of infiltration and espionage that tingles the nerves; however, there is slight inelegance in the story that downplays the complete cinematic experience."
5,VERY GOOD KOREAN MOVIE,This is a very VERY VERY good korean movie. I saw it a long time ago because it already came out in Korea like 3 years ago. This movie is action packed and very surprising. BUY IT
