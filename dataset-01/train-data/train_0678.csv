5,Evil Dead is a horror classic. One of the best.,"Evil Dead takes place in a cabin in the woods where a handful of post-teens encounter demons summoned by the book of the dead. An absolute masterpeice! There is, for this genre, an amazing amount of suspense, and even for this genre, an amazing amount of gore in this late 70's flick. Many critics rate it the most gory movie of all time! But don't let that throw you- It is what horror is supposed to be- a carnival ride in the form of a movie. Definately recommended is the first sequel- Evil Dead II- Dead by Dawn. Not to be ignored is the subtle level of dark (and I mean dark) humor in Evil Dead. It's at the tp of the line for horror fans and just people looking for a good scare alike."
4,A damn good horror flick,"Raimi is a genius! This isn't really much in the plot or originality department, but who cares? It is so much fun. Yes the acting and film is bad, but the camera angles and insanity of the story make this a winner. The scene where a woman gets molested and raped by a tree is in poor taste, however."
2,"Revisionists - 3, Traditionalists - 0","I am going to be very nit-picky but it needs to be pointed out.First, go get your old Elite DVD or, better yet, your old Thorn/EMI VHS tape and watch it up to the point where Scott, Ash and the girls begin to drive over the bridge. Now, look toward the right of the screen (between the bridge's guard rails) and you will see one of the film's crew members standing there in a big puffy coat.Now, plug in your Blu-ray and watch that same scene. Through the magic of computer wizardry, Sam Raimi pulls a George Lucas and magically removes this endearing film flub.C'mon, Sam! Seriously? For the past thirty years horror fans have rejoiced in seeing that poor slob accidently immortalized in your film AND NOW you decide to take him out??? First George Lucas, then Steven Spielberg and now we add Sam Raimi to the cinema revisionist club?Oh, these are dark days we live in."
5,MUST HAVE MUST HAVE!!!,"There are only two words to be said about this DVD MUST and HAVE, the cover artwork is amasing and the film itself couldnt't be better, it is truly a special edition, but be quick its rumoured that there are only 1000 being made because thay are all hand made. Thats it, go for the ""add to my basket button""!!"
5,BEAUTIFULL CLASSIC!!,"this is one of my favorite movies, it rocked back in the day and it still does. the acting is good the makeup is good everything is great. it's a classic worth gold. bruce campbell and his team did a beautiful job. the setting is great, the horror, and you just have to watch it to understand. the whole thing takes place somewhere in the middle of some very creepy woods. it's all possessed, and the cabin where they stay is not as safe as it seems. they have to fight demons before they are taken over and it'll be to late. but once you're in there's no way out. and the two movies after this are just as good. i applaud this series."
4,Fun Flick,"This movie set the stage (and a high bar) for campy horror flicks that followed. For fun, I researched the ""prequel"" that Sam Raimi put together for less than $2K called ""Within the Woods,"" which he used to attract more funding for ""Evil Dead."" It's 30 minutes of raw footage, and quite spooky."
5,One of the Best Horror Movies Ever Created,"If you like zombies, monsters, or anything else that will scare people, ""The Evil Dead"" has it. This movie is one of my personal favorite movies of all-time. This movie was followed by two sequels and two video games (get a fistful of boomstick). The gore factor is very high (the only way to kill the ""deadites"" is two chop them up) and there is a lot of suspense. There is even a scene where a woman is raped by a tree! I highly recomend this movie if you are a die-hard horror fan."
3,Good movie but acting left something desired,"This movie has a good story to tell and it is a cult classic, but for a movie that was made in '79, I expected the acting to be on par with the storyline."
5,ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES EVER MADE!!!!!,"EVEN THOUGH IT WAS LOW BUDGET, THIS MOVIE WAS SO AHEAD OF ITS TIME. A BUNCH OF FRIENDS GO TO A CABIN IN THE WOODS. THEY FIND THE BOOK OF THE DEAD AND A TAPE RECORDING OF A RESEARCHER THAT WAS TRYING YEARS BEFORE TO DECIPHER THE BOOK. WHEN THE BOOK IS READ ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!! THE WOODS COME TO LIFE AND A WOMAN IS ACTUALLY RAPED BY A TREE!!! IT IS VERY SAD THAT THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, WHO IN MY OPINION COPIED THE MOVIE STYLE OF THIS, GOT ALL THE HYPE AND MONEY AND THIS MOVIE ONLY OBTAINED A CULT STATUS. A MUST SEE FOR ANY REAL HORROR/GORE FAN."
1,Die Hards Only,"The Book of the Dead may be the most extras-laden, fleshiest edition of the original, classic Evil Dead film available in the US. However, like all US DVD releases, it has a problem- the aspect ratio is wrong. Get a multi region player and buy the UK 4 disc set."
1,Do not buy this edition.,"Do not buy this edition.Just don't.Until they put out a full frame of this masterpiece, just boycot it."
2,OK.,"I LIKED THIS ENOUGH. USUALLY THESE ARE MY TYPES OF MOVIES, FUN, CHEESY, AND SCARY. BUT THIS ONE JUST WASN'T FOR ME I GUESSE. BEING A CHRISTIAN, I DIDN'T CARE FOR THE UNNECISSARY NUDITY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AVERAGE. I'M NOT OUT TO AFFEND ANYBODY. I KNOW MOST EVERYBODY LOVED THIS MOVIE, IT'S JUST MY OPINION. I, HOVEVER, LOVED THE SEQUELS."
2,Terrible!!!!,This movie is a total fluke to me. There isn't anything scary about it. I think it is more so stupid than anything. I actually found it to be quit amusing than scary. Those zombies where a crock in my opinion. This movie is so chessy it's pathetic.
2,Like the movie; Hate the quality of the picture,"I hate the quality of this movie. It was not remastered as said on the case. It looks more like my VHS copy of this movie, which shows a little better. The picture was a little fuzzy at times and not sharpe at all. The movie is gory and violent. It's not for children at all, so parents beware. I am a horror fan, and this movie is one of my favorites to watch except toward the end after Ash throws the book of the dead into the fireplace. Sorry to expose that information, but what happens next is too gross even for me. I still have to turn my head on most of that scene. Overall, I had to give it two stars for the quality of the picture. Four stars for the movie though, its a gory ride."
3,Still brilliant,"I almost laugh myself to death whenever I see this movie, it is excellent, funny and by far the superior of the series. However, it is expensive for a 20 year old movie, regardless of the pretty packaging and extra features. ...P>However, it is nice to see the movie uncut for the first time in a while, it has been to long since the full version was available in the UK."
5,An Avant-Gardist Film,"Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.This team made the best horror film in 80's.But this film's effect still to smear.When this film was starting to show in theatres,two juror died to afraid. In 80's film technology hasnt devoloped enough.And he knew this.But Sam Raimi wanted to make a good film and he managed to. In this film there r a lots of tension,frightening and gore scenes.In this respect film is excellent and satisfy.Other way make ups r so cool and belivable.Cast's r very good and the places r so fascinating.This film is a real horror film.And this film is an Avant-Gardist in horror film's sector. I have seen all Evil Dead series but i have never feel the horror like the first one.I think the best horror film in the 80's and 90's."
4,Gory and Pleasing,"Way to much gore for my liking. But on the other hand, I just thought the acting was pretty good. Everything in this movie is shown, it is incredibly graphic, and there is one absoutley disturbing scene where, a girl gets violently rapped by a tree. Bloody stabbings, axe chopping, decapitation by shovel, dead people returning back to live, white eyeballs, rotting corpses and much much much more gore and graphic violence. Keep in mind, this is why this movie is rated NC-17: for substantial graphic horror violence and gore. *thanks to www.filmratings.com*"
5,Perfect Package for a Classic Flick,"Enough has been said about the movie. You should see it, and you will probably love it. Once you do.....For anyone who really loves The Evil Dead, whether it was then or you just discovered it, this is the DVD package to own. I had never seen the movie with such clarity. I had NO idea that it was so well done. I should have known that it was better than those old copies of copies videotapes made it look! It's Sam Raimi for goodness' sake!But anyway, with the Book of the Dead artwork, the extras, and the article inside, it's a great thing to own and display. I can't tell you how many people have been intrigued by the DVD just propped up on my entertainment center. (It goes really well with the Julia figure from Hellbound, too!)Buy it now. You won't regret it."
5,Best actor ever is Bruce Campbell,"Wow. Horror film fans buy this movie right now or deadites will swallow your soul! Just kidding, but rent this movie at least. You will not regret it, assuredly!"
4,Amusing 70's Horror movie,"I remember Evil Dead 2 very well as a kid. I then read Bruce Campbell was releasing a remake of the original Evil Dead.It is not as good as ""2"", but definitely has it's moments. Very gory for a 70's movie."
5,WOW!! The packaging itself makes your flesh crawl...,"The feel of the moulded latex box, the patterns moulded on it to mimic the book from the movie, and the ear on the back of the box just makes you shiver as you pick it up. The pages inside are recreations of the artwork in the Necronomicon in the movie, and the accompanying handbook gives a good history of the film. The DVD itself is marvelous, from the menu sequence with various undead faces appearing as if through mist, to the director's commentary track - all top rate stuff. I would recommend you all buy this collector's item as it will be well sought after in a few years."
3,This movie's okay,"Five friends rent a cabin in the woods and release an evil spirit into the area that turns them all into zombies. Very impressive visuals and a good time to be had, but this is not as scary or gory as reputation has it. I'd recommend popcorn, pepsi and pizza but you'd probably throw them up."
4,Join us!,The Evil Dead is a very good movie. It is about 5 friends who decide to take a weekend at a deserted mountain cabin and awake something in the woods. One by one they become possesed by evil in the woods. This film I think tries to be too serious when it doesn't have to be. There is a very interesting rape scene in which a girl gets raped by the woods themselves. Sam Raimi is a genious at stuff like this!
4,The Best Movie Of All Time,"The movie tells that a group of five teens went to a small cabin in the Tenessee mountains. In there, they have ressurected the Evil force, known as a Kandarian Demon. They find also a deadly book, the Necronomicon Ex Mortis (Book Of The Dead), which is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood.The movie has lots of violence and gore (that's why it's rated NC-17).The reason I don't give this edition five stars is by the fact that there are no extras, no booklets, nothing else but the movie. The movie itself is surely a 5-star one...So, if you are a horror fan, you must own this movie. If you do not have a DVD Player, if you're still in the old VHS system, buy this cult classic."
4,Evil Dead,"As far as teenage horror movies go this is pretty decent stuff. It is easy to see the tongue in cheek humor as well. I can see why it is a cult favorite. Part of a trilogy I think they got better as actor Bruce Campbell and Director Sam Raimi felt comfortable with this theme and took it further and further. By the time they got to ""Army of Darkness"" it became mostly comedy with some horror. AOD is my favorite of the three because of the outrageous bits and great special effects. This is a great collection for fans of horror/comedy movies. If you enjoyed this catch ""Scary Movie"".CA Luster"
5,Scary as Hell,"One of the scariest horror movies of all time. Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, which followed, were comedies in my opinion. Not that they were not good, actually they are both great in their own rights. But Evil Dead is true horror, I remember seeing this in theaters during a mid-night showing in the `80s and it scared the hell out of everyone. It is even better on DVD. The audio and video have been remastered, this film has never looked this good. The audio commentaries by Sam and Bruce are priceless as well as the excerpts and extras included. This is the only version of this film to own. Folks familiar with Elite will know what I am talking about. Those of you who have not seen an Elite DVD are in for a pleasant surprise."
3,Don't play with tape recorders that don't belong to you,"A group of friends vacationing in a woodland cabin off in the middle of nowhere find a tape recorder that releases an evil spell, turning them into zombies. Wow, where did they put the plot? Better than the average effects driven low budgeter featuring ugly people trying to kill one another. Periodically followed by rip off immitators who don't come close enough to topping this. Though, the modern hype does make inicial viewing of this a disappointment, it leaves you with the desire to see it again soon after seeing it once."
4,Low Budget Schlock can give quality thrills.,"Anyone who watches any of the Evil Dead series should know going in that they are low budget films, but enter with an openmind and you will not go away dissapointed. Sure the sets and actors are not from the Hollywood mold, but that in essence is what makes this film and others of it's genre trully artful. Bymaking the most with what they had to work with, Sam Raimi andcast make a real attempt to freighten while never taking themselves or their craft too seriously.Evil Dead and it'sbrethen are great for what they are: tongue in cheek horrorat it't very best, anybody who watches this movie and doesn't laugh at least a little, just don't get it. Not every directorgets $100 milion to make Waterworld, but for those who get it, these movies rock!!!"
3,Beware -- Single Disc Edition,"I had read a review of the new release of Evil Dead on blu ray and that review included a large section on the second disc and the many bonus features contained therein. Imagine my disappointment when I cracked open my recently-purchased disc from Amazon only to find a single disc edition with no second disc!!! I had no idea the 2-disc version was in such short supply and that I would not be getting it. In fact, I had no idea there was a single-disc version at all!I see that Amazon has changed the description to a single disc with almost no bonus features, so it's probably my fault for not looking more carefully. Nevertheless...Grrr!"
4,Updated Commentary for Blu-ray Release,"I love the Evil Dead series and decided to get them all on Blu-ray and ditch my DVD copies. Well, not so fast, junior. This new Blu-ray release of Evil Dead has a brand new commentary track with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, and Bruce Campbell -- which is great, considering the DVD versions of the film had two different commentary tracks (one with Sam & Robert, and another with just Bruce). It's nice to have one commentary track with all these guys bantering, but they should have included the previous commentary tracks as well. In the older ones, they spent more time explaining each shot as you watched the film. In the new commentary track, they pretty much ignore what's happening on screen and just talk about how the film was financed, produced, and distributed -- which is great information. I just miss the old, scene-oriented commentaries on the DVDs. Also, would looooove to have an additional commentary track by the Ladies of Evil Dead!"
2,Nowhere near as good as the second one..dont bother,"VERY slow and boring, poor special effects, ..Bruce Campbell is great, but...the movie blows overall. Go and buy the SECOND in the series: Army of Darkness....THAT movie is HYSTERICAL and GREAT..you will understand why there is such a huge cult following for THAT movie!"
1,"Can't review as they sent wrong blu ray,TWICE!","Yes,they advertised the 2 disc version but on 2 seperate occasions sent the one disc version.So that's my review."
2,evil dead sucked,"skip this turkey but don't miss the much better evil dead 2 + 3. the cheap special effects and poor soundtrack along with the device of making the camera the ""evil"" make the movie too irritating to enjoy. bruce campbell turns in a great cheesy performance in all 3 films and is the best thing about them."
4,THE EVIL DEAD Rock!,"THE EVIL DEAD is one of the most infamous cult classic horror movies to be made (and it spawned two successful sequels, too). The plot is isn't that hard to understand: four college kids rent a cabin deep in the woods of Tennesse for the weekend. They find an old tape recorder in the cabin's basement and decide to listen to it, not knowing that it contains chanting words that will summon the dead spirits of the underworld to rise up and possess the living. They play the the tape and all hell, literally breaks lose. The only one who remains unpossessed is Ash, and now he must arm himself with shotgun and chainsaw and wage battle against his demon-possessed friends in order to survive the night. This movie is definitley not for those who have weak stomachs because it is graphically violent and very intense. I liked enough, though, to recommend it to horror fans everywhere!"
3,"""Within The Woods-Less""","I Bought the DVD From Sam Goodies, Everything was great.. Loved the ""Book Of The Dead"" And all, But the REAL Reason i bought the DVD Was for ""Within The Woods"", Wich once i got home... Wasn't on the DVD, Wich REALLY Made me Dissapointed.. I've seen Thousands of Reviews, About Within The Woods being on this DVD, I Dont know Who got rid of it, But i loved the Necromocon case, And the pages we're done good by Tom Sullivan, THX Just Messed up big time.. The Picture was Awsome and all, But what i wanted the DVD for wasn't there..Thanks,-Ryan"
1,This is not a box set!,"Thios rating is for the blu-ray DVD only, not the movie. If you decide to buy this, there are some things you should be aware of...This IS NOT the two disc edition. For the new 1 disc blu-ray, all the special features have been removed except a commentary track.This WILL NOT play in all players. When you start the disc, you either have to watch or skip thru 4 trailers. At this point, my LG player goes black. I was only able to get a menu 3 times out of dozens of tries (by fast forwarding thru the last trailers instead of using skip) and then I was not able to make any selections, so I never got to watch the movie. If you decide to buy this, make sure you know what you are getting into."
3,Baby Talk - Simplicity,An enjoyable read that has a lot of good information on the best ways to talk to your baby and to allow them to develop their language skills.
2,Kilby- the formative years,"This guy is a true prodigy. I have never heard a faster or cleaner guitar picker than Kilby. But, that's now. He was only a teenager when Just Me was recorded. It's a remarkable effort if only for the fact that he plays all the instruments here, but he had not yet achieved the brilliance that he now displays and the music here is not an indication of the level that he would later reach. Good enough for most, but once you have heard him in Kentucky Thunder nothing else measures up. I wish he would record another CD today...."
3,¿copia completa?,"Creo que la versión no es completa, pues NO tiene las escenas de desnudos de Gael Garcia-Bernal"
2,Sleep on this one.,"I was recommended this movie by a friend of mine. My friend and I share a good deal of favorites when it comes to movies, but this is not one of them.The premise of the movie, the life of a man who cannot tell dream from reality, was different and held a great deal of potential. I will not go too deep into story details since I am not sure where I would begin spoiling some of the (rather thin) plot. However, the movie's potential is wasted on a cast of shallow characters and a storyline that not only goes nowhere, it manages to make you feel less for the characters as the movie goes along. I came to dislike the ""protagonist"" of the story the most as the story spiraled into pointless weirdness and crudeness.Since this movie won some awards at film festivals I just may not ""get"" this movie. If this movie requires some kind of acquired taste I would not go through the agony of having to endure till I liked it."
4,Science of Sleep review,"I enjoyed this movie. It was interesting and captivating, and exposed what we seldom see manifest: the child within. Though the ending was anticlimactic, it left room for the imagination to fill in details to follow. It's as if the writer wants the viewer to finish the picture.Use of graphics and manipulation enhanced the surreal experience and helped me to identify with the state of the protagonist. As an artist, I found this movie insightful and inspirational in an off sort of way. The use of different languages juxtaposed cultural fusion and isolation. Overall this movie was a good investment of time."
4,Good but bad..,"I am a huge fan of movies, but I also have certain morals to follow. This movie as a movie was great. But there was so much sexual references it really seemed unnecessary. The style of the movie and editing was great. I also love multi-lingual stories."
3,"not my favorite, but still cute","Although this movie was incredibly cute, innovative, and the actors were extremely talented, this movie was not for me. My boyfriend absolutely adores it though, and has watched it three times. I did not know it has subtitles going into it, so maybe that was why, but I did, in fact, fall asleep during the science of sleep."
4,Dreaming is the best part of my day,"Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie. I loved the artistry and the shifting from dream to reality and back. But the crude sophomoric behavior of the French subtracted from what would have been a nearly perfect movie. I didn't want to be subjected to farting and indiscriminate sexual innuendo in a movie that so uniquely and effectively covered the best part of my own life: sleeping and dreaming. If this is what passes for normal or acceptable behavior in France today, I'm a little upset. (I don't like what passes for normal or acceptable in America either, just so you understand me). I must be too sensitive or something, but the potty jokes and raunchiness erased what could have been a blissful movie experience."
2,No me gustó,"Esta película tiene unos subtítulos en inglés que no se desaparecen con la opción del menú: sin subtítulos, están PERMANENTEMENTE ahí, es muy incómodo verla."
2,Cure for insomnia,"The Science of Sleep does just that, puts you to sleep and then you wake up, it's still playing and you wonder if your having a bad dream. I was disapointed to say the least."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. There is absolutely no plot, the characters are unlikable and hard to care about (with the exception of Stephane's co-worker Guy), and the effects are cute but really nothing magical. It seems like it wants to be a hip, sexy, trendy movie with something profound to say about being young, artistic and in love, but there is really nothing that it says at all. I only watched it completely out of sheer stubbornness, but there are much better ways to spend 106 minutes of your life. The same guy wrote Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: that was a vastly better movie than this one. In comparison, this is more quirky, but with less heart. Don't waste your time."
1,Do not waste your money or time,"I did not like this movie, I think Gael is a good actor, but lately he is directing or producing some independent movies, maybe I got lost in the science of sleep but honestly there is no science on sleeping and neither in this movie"
5,Love it!,"I love this movie. It's whimsical, quirky and romantic. It's sort of a surrealist movie where the main character lives in a state in which he confuses his dreams and reality...My favorite movie of all time. <3"
4,Dreamy and fun,"This is a creative, playful, and unique film. It's about a young man's inability to separate his sleeping, dreaming, and waking states which lead to wacky situations. The elaborate dream sequences are quite imaginative and fun to watch. However, Stephane, the main character, is annoying and childish. He is socially awkward and his actions bordered on stalking poor Stephanie. I did laugh out loud at some of Gael Garcia Bernal's excellent delivery."
4,Science of Sleep artistry,The Science of Sleep is artistically beautiful if not lacking a bit in plot. There are parts where it is slow and artificially disjointed but overall the images and good acting are more than worth watching.
5,"Movie is wonderful, but we need BLU RAY at this $20 price",Absolutely loved this movie the more i watched it. I would like to buy it for my collection but i want it in blu ray. how dare they sell this dvd for $19.99 and not a blu ray!BLU RAY PLEASE!!!
1,The movie stunk but Charlotte Gainsbourg is wonderful !,"That says it all. The movie is pretentious jive and stands as a testament to the money foolish people will throw away on something that is supposed to be art.But Charlotte Gainsbourg, that is another story. What a sweet heart. This is a women who needs to become a star. I'll watch for her again."
5,A must have CD...,"If you buy this CD only for Burton's stunning version of Poinciana- it's a bargain. Everything else is icing on the cake. Tenderly and Tossed salad and scrambled eggs are superb. I recommend this CD as a ""must have"" essential."
3,One is enough,"Most of this CD is just okay, but the cover of Ahmad Jamal's ""Poinciana"" is worth the price. I listened to this one, Keith Jarrett's version and Ahmad Jamal's original while doing my treadmill. Thought I'd died and gone to heaven."
3,First video of 3,4 episodes 30 minutes each. The acting is good. Sound is fine but picture is poor because the 16mm film prints (used for the DVD transfer) are worn with noticable dirt & scratches in the picture which distracts from the enjoyment of the episodes. From a historicle point of view these are fine & true to the Bible. You may want to watch one episode at a time (as I did) rather than watching the whole thing in 1 to 4 sittings.
3,Wearing of Shirt,"This shirt does a good job insofar as my job requirements go for safety, but this shirt is definitely not for extremely hot weather. With having no cotton content, it is very hot to wear. I bought this shirt as a trial to see if it worked better that my safety vest, but it is hotter than the vest to wear. It would probably wear best in the cooler months of the year. Possibly the manufacturer should consider more cotton content for coolness. I normally wear an XL, but with the reflector stripes you need to one size bigger for room to move."
2,I don't like it,Don't allow air to flow through the shirt. Sticks to your skin. Stitching from the reflective strips cause skin to itch
4,"a bit tight, but good overall","It's a little tight in the shoulders and upper back, and just generally a bit smaller than standard T-shirts. I ordered an XL and I'm 6'0"", 200 pounds and I lift weights. I'm not huge, but I could have used a little more room. Otherwise, everything else seems great."
4,"Works Well, cute color","I wanted a cloth to clean the greasy spots off of my glasses and laptop, and it works just fine. Gets the spots off, and is gentle enough to use on my new tablet, too."
4,Works great!,"Got this for my Kindle Fire's screen since I can't stand finger smudges. Works a lot better than the tissues I've been using! One or two swipes and the prints are gone.The only problem I have about this is the little pouch that came with it. Either I'm horrible at folding this thing back up, or the pouch included is a little too small. It's more or less a little plastic baggie. I can't get the cloth to fit in the pouch without folding it over awkwardly in the pouch or bunching it up."
4,Weebles Wobble...,"I bought these for my niece, who has the Weeble Castle. She has a blast playing with these. They are lightweight, durable, and easy to clean. They have no sharp edges, so you don't have to worry about children getting hurt. They are big enough that they can't be swolled or stuck up a nostril. There are small enough, though, to fit in a diaper bag. These are the toys we usually pack for her when we are going out to eat. She likes them and they can do no damage to her or to the table."
4,Cute Toys,"I like this set, I wish you could still buy the activity sets (only one I've seen is a girl's princess set, and I have a boy), and the rest were collector sets from a while ago."
3,Easy to read,"This is an easy to read book, that is quite enjoyable. I was disappointed by the ending & the characters in the book weren't developed enough, but it is an ok book to read if you have nothing to do on a lazy Sunday."
1,Experiening Hong Kong,I was very disapointed in this DVD.I had hoped that it would take me to alll the high-lighted tourist spots that we saw when we were in Hong Kong in the summer. I wanted to be able to share this with friends and family to give them an idea of what HK is really like.This DVD is more about the political and economical enviroment of HK with a bit of history and information on the take over from the British in 1997.
2,It Could Have Been Good,"I gave this film 2 stars primarily due to the transfer. It looked as though it was transferred from a low quality tape. The story and acting was actually better than I expected. It was a little shallow,but the writer made up for it by adding more unexpected twists. They probably tried to do a little too much as it ended up as a survival tale and very little of that. Some of this was shot in what I am presuming, was a nudistresort, and some attention was given to showing scenes of various activities, such as kids on a slide and such. All in all, it was an ok film that would be better suited for rental rather than purchase. As for unsatisfied, it left me unsatisfied although the transfer was better. As for the ladies on the cover, that is where they're at, on the cover, not in the movie. These two movies are an ok rental but that is about it. Charlie S."
3,Good Mouse (but mine personaly had troubles),"So I odered the mouse on the 3rd of October the shipping was good and at fisrt it worked just fine but after a few days of use it started lagging and stopped working all-together. Its not the usb receiver-computer connection its the Mouse-usb receiver connection. it worked just fine with my computer it just stoppped working with the receiver.NOTE!It was supper easy to set up,It is not slow,I have Windows 7 (on the only other review there was a comment that said it didn't work with Vista or Windows 7)"
1,Leave home without it,"No matter how well an item looks, is priced or works you have to judge it for it's intended purpose. In this case this product completely fails. It's intended to be used on travel but in it's first use the cheap plastic side table broke where the pins attach it to the grill body when trying to pack it back up. Since they are used to secure the grill together in its travel form this is a serious flaw. I'm sure they will replace these parts under warranty but it makes you wonder about the construction.Update - Meco does not carry this part so the grill must be shipped back to Amazon. Amazon has provided a free shipping label and will refund the purchase."
3,Good grill but not hot enough to cook good...,"This is a good home grill but the only thing I do not like is, it is not hot enough too cook. I replaced the regulator but that did not help any. I think it is the valve that is not working correctly.. They need to do some work on this...Floyd Perry"
2,.... Too Bad,"This Korean Drama started with so much promise and then ended with a fizzle that was so bad, I didn't even like the lead man anymore... he was just too indecisive and pathetic. I can't recommend this drama. No matter how good the first 13 hours were, they weren't worth sitting through for the final, long, drawn out ending."
5,Nice!,It was the same as what you would get at an auto store but without the auto store price! Was exactly what we thought it would be.
5,Milowitz Considered,"It's high time someone wrote an insightful book about this Brilliant Jewish-American author, and Dr. Steven M. Milowitz has risen to the task. Milowitz whisks us away on a provocative and challenging magic carpet ride through the concentrationary Universe of the pulitzer-prize winning author. It is a masterpiece of modern literary critism: combining intensive scholarship with insightful anicdotes to bring us a work of such staggering genius one can not help but marvel. Hats off to you, Doc!"
3,How to really make progresses and help ourself,"Read the book impartially and look for the thing in your life that you do not know where they come from- why there's always been difficulties in relationships, secrets and neglected families members- then you will undestand what is Hellinger doing, which is much more ""positive"" than labelling people' problems. Read it over and read it again after some time, this book deserves unprejudiced attention."
4,Adequate introduction to family constellations but can be done better,"This introduction to Bert Hellinger's work consists of interviews of him with a political scientists. The way Hellinger's family constellations unfold, they usually support more conservative positions regarding sexuality and labor division in family, so there is some interesting tension between the liberal interviewer and the wise old man Hellinger. It also becomes clear that Hellinger treats spirituality as something quite earthly and this-worldly, amounting mostly to facing life's challenges.The biggest minus of the book is absence of diagrams of the constellations that are described. For this reason, I suggest getting 'Love's Hidden Symmetry' or 'Love's Own Truths' instead. But this is definitely an okay book too."
3,GC Cameron,I must admit that I purchased this cd for theoutstanding Stevie produced cut'If you don't love me'.I also like 'Trippin' arranged by Marvin Gaye.
2,Cute but cheap,"I purchased these boots for a costume party for work. Before I even arrived at my event, the seam down the middle of the back of one boot had already started to come apart. They were really cute on if you ignored the gaping hole on my calf. I had intended to get two uses out of these this year and wear for Halloween, but looks like I will have to get them repaired somewhere before that can happen.Chacha Boot White Size 7 Accessory"
2,"Fun boots, but quality is horrendous","When I pulled these out of the box, they reeked the PVC plastic smell so badly that I had to let them air out of awhile before I tried them on. After the smell was somewhat tolerable, I grabbed the shoes to put them on, and I noticed the left shoe was horribly scuffed and that the paint was coming off really bad, like it got attacked with scissors or something. Such a bummer! I ordered them for Halloween and I was just planning on wearing them for the night, but for that price I was annoyed all the whole thing and just sent them back. I will give 2 stars because they are really a fun, cute 60's shoe, minus the PVC smell and the terrible quality when you look up close."
4,Love it because it has Joe!,My son is 9 months and 3 weeks old but has fallen in love with Blues Clues (Joe's version that is). This DVD has 2 great episodes with Joe on it including Big Band and Bedtime Blues which is a great one to play before bedtime! I have tried to not be bias and play the ones with Steve on the TV for him but he will not watch and frankly neither will we he is pretty lame! It was a good purchase.
2,LittleTouch,"I have mixed feelings about the LittleTouch LeapPad. The age range was 6mo to 2 years. At 6 mos my daughter wasn't the least bit interested in this. At 16 mos. she was only interested in turning it on and off. Now at 21 mos. she's more interested - but she's outgrown the Let's Get Busy, Baby! - she already knows all the words and is bored enough to revert to just turning it on and off. Maybe it's a good product for less active children. Mine's not one of those."
4,review of Babys first words,my product arrived in a very timely manner and it was packaged well and in pretty darn well perfect condition. thank you..
5,EXCELLENT GIFT FOR TODDLER,"I PURCHASED THE LITTLE TOUCH SYSTEM AND BOOKS FOR MY 20 MONTH OLD SON FOR CHRISTMAS. WE SIT FOR HOURS AND READ THEM TOGETHER. OUT OF ALL THE BOOKS HE FINDS THIS ONE MOST INTERESTED SINCE THE BABIES IN THE BOOK APPEAL TO HIM A BIT MORE THAN THE REST.THE ONLY FAULT IS THAT THE ON/OFF BUTTON IS TOO EASY FOR HIM TO ACCESS AND HE KEEPS TURNING IT ON AND OFF JUST TO HEAR IT SAY ""BYE BYE"".I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO PURCHASE THIS SYSTEM FOR THEIR LITTLE ONES!"
5,Excellent teaching tool,"We have a lot of these books and this is the best one. My 16 month old has been playing with it for a few months but now can ""remember"" favorite pages. This book teaches children to categorize objects and teaches them the names of many everyday items. We use all three levels (sounds, words/phrases, stories) depending on his mood. The goodnight page is last, perfect for before bed."
3,Too much background noise...(narration) and too touch sensitive,"Leappads are a great learning tool for children. However, I find the incessant narration to be too busy for children to pay attention to. My 81-mos daughters get easily distracted with all the noise. The technology involves individual pages which have certain places which you press. This in turn, correlates to certain recording on the main unit. This is how each page speaks specifically to that page. Often times if you just touch places on a page (since babies love to just touch everything), other page contents starts speaking... If you own one you'll know what I'm talking about.I wish they would perfect it a little better and cut down on some of the background narration. Children love to explore and touch everything! Too busy/noisy for a small child."
5,Exellent Value.,"The best electric heater I've seen. Uses crush proof vents to easily convect your heat to the room. Produces a nice even comfortable heat when operated with proprtional control(Triac) thermostat. Made in USA. Do yourself and your country a favor. When you think electric heat, think King Electric Mfg. co. I have no affilition with the mfr."
4,Working Smart,Bought Marketing and Biz Plan builder to help my daughter develop a business plan for her college accounting class. She scored an A and learned how to do the analysis. Other students were amazed.
5,Great way to start collecting Lucerne Festival concerts,"This is a collection of live performance of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra between 2003 and 2006. Four of five discs were previously released as individual DVDs.2003Debussy: La Mer/Le Martyre De Saint Sebastien/Lucerne Festival Orchestra/Claudio Abbado2004Mahler - Symphony No. 5 / Claudio Abbado, Lucerne Festival Orchestra2005Bruckner/Beethoven - Symphony No. 7, Piano Concerto No. 3, Alfred Brendel, Claudio Abbado2006Mahler: Symphony No. 6 [DVD VideoIn addition the set includes the documentary ""The History of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra"" and Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 4 by Pollini, which was not available in DVD before.The set is priced more attractively than individual DVDs, especially at Amazon Marketplace. Highly recommended."
1,WE WANTED A BOY.....BUT CONCEIVED TWIN GIRLS,"We had two girls and wanted a boy, so we purchased this book and prepared for six months for the big day. We followed the instructions 100%...the results, two more beatiful girls.We will continue looking for the boy, but next time we will do the opposite of what the book says."
5,it works!,Im 19 weeks pregnant and bought this book over 2 years ago and back in sep 2005 my husband and i finally made our mind up to try for a boy since we already have a 5 year old girl and my husband is the last boy in his family.Did everything after the book and used ovulation kit to be 100% about ovulation and we are now pregnant with a boy!!Awsome book and i know it will work as long as you follow the guidelines.Good luck!
3,Did Not Work For Me!,"We followed the book to try for a boy, but a healthy baby was our goal. My husband and I followed the book exactly! We already had a daughter and wanted a son. I even told everyone when I was pregnant that it would be a boy (because the book gives a 80% success rate). We went to the ultrasound and found out it was a girl! Our second daughter was born 10 months ago, very healthy and very active! I don't think I would try the method again, except that you are aware of your fertility cycles which helps conception."
5,How to choose the sex of your baby: Method Supported ...,My husband convinced me to have one more baby after already having two wonderful daughters. He really wanted to try for that boy. We decided to try to improve our odds of conceiving a boy. We purchased this book and read it in its entirety. Our ultrasound last week indicates that we were successful. We have a boy coming in June. My husband is overjoyed. I highly recommend this book for people who are looking to balance out their families.
2,"Too much ""Clinical"" or ""Medical"" Terminology","This book is hard to follow and moves along very slowly before ""eventually"" getting to the point. Has alot of complex medical terminology and you have to follow along as if you went through 8 years of Medical School before you get to the basic information.Don't recommend for those trying to weed out all the clinical ""jargon"" and eager to get right down to it."
2,unsuccessful sex selection attempt,"My husband and I have two wonderful daughters and we decided we would like to have a third child. We would love and accept the child regardless of the sex. After reading How to Choose the Sex of your Baby and making a sex selection attempt trying for a boy, our son was born. I thought the book was well written and made a lot of sense. We had such a wonderful pregnancy/birth experience we decided to have another child, attempting another son, thus completing our family. We timed intercourse according to the instructions, even confirming the accuracy by using an ovulation predictor kit. I am absolutely certain the timing was accurate. We were disappointed to learn we are expecting another girl.This child will be as loved and cherished as the others and our family is complete but my advice is unless you are absolutely certain you will be satisfied with the sex of your baby, do not attempt ANY sex selection method. Basically I think mother nature cannot be manipulated."
3,It's okay,"This book is well detailed. If you want the short sweet version, order ""baby Boy or Baby Girl."""
1,just a little advice,"I haven't purchased the book yet, though I think I will. I truly beleive that whatever child you get is a blessing from God and only He will decide the sex. However, I also believe in doing whatever you can, on your own to tip the scale and then leave it to Him. My husband and I have a beautiful, smart, funny, blind little boy. His blindness comes froma genetic disease that is 99% more likely to coour in males, so we would like to have a girl next. We checked into gender selection thorugh spinning and they only give an 85% chance as well. IVF is not an option due to finances. If we try and the gender selection works, we will add some stars on the review. However, our son is the light of our lives and we re incredibly blessed to have him despite and because of his blindness. We will remember and hope you will too, that any child..boy, girl perfect or with special needs is a blessing and we will love him or her no matter what."
1,It didn't work,"I am kicking myself every day for not doing IVF, as that is the only secure way of getting the gender you want. Everyone I knew suggested not doing IVF and I was not really excited about pumping my body full of hormones. We also thought of trying spinning, but it was not an option, because we didn't have a child yet. My husband and I really wanted a son, I have never wanted more than one child and have never had any interest in having a daughter, so we tried this method and practiced every suggestion in here by the book. I was skeptical with good reason. About 3 weeks ago they deterimined that we are having a girl and I have been having a really difficult time with it. If you really care about having a child of a certain gender, I suggest that you either try IVF or spinning if you have the financial resources. The Shettles method lacks substantial controlled scientific research and I would advise everyone not to rely on it."
3,"Interesting, but maybe not exactly what you're looking for...","This book takes an in depth look at the whole history of sex selection, and it also presents/refutes several modern methods of choosing your child's gender (including the Dr. Shettles method, of course). I found this to be a really interesting read, but I feel like Toni Weschler'sTaking Charge of Your Fertility, 10th Anniversary Edition: The Definitive Guide to Natural Birth Control, Pregnancy Achievement, and Reproductive Healthis much more useful. If you are looking for an interesting study on gender selection methods, or if you are reading this after reading Dr. Weschler's book, you might enjoy this book or find it useful. However, if you are looking for the best way to increase your chances of having one gender over another, I say please read Taking Charge of Your Fertility first."
4,TRYING,"I am trying for a boy. I have run into a little problem, I'm not ovulating at all. But after I get straigtened out I will try for a boy and tell you how it goes!"
3,If you like History...,"The first 100 pages of this book deal with how good this method is and how wonderful Dr. Shettles is. That may be true, but not very useful. The key aspect of sex selection is the timing of intercourse around ovulation. This and all other aspects of fertility are explained in much clearer and greater detail in the wonderful book Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Weschler. She provides LOTS of charts and examples and photos to help you track your cycle compared to just three sample charts in Dr. Shettles book. She also summarizes the techniques for sex selection in a separate chapter, and it makes a lot more sense after her detailed explanation of overall cycle tracking. If you're really focused on sex selection, you may gain some extra from Dr. Shettles book (like who should and shouldn't drink coffee), but it should be read in combination with Toni Weschler's book, which will answer any practical questions you have left."
2,"Tried for a girl, got a boy","I bought this book along with several others and found myself confused. Many things conflicted from book to book but my mom and my sister both used Shettles for their boys after two girls so I stuck with it. We had a four day cut off. We followed his directions to a T. Our third son is now 18 mo old. It is not the endall. It may work for some, but does not for others. To me, it's still a 50/50 chance. You could do nothing and still end up with the opposite gender. Good luck."
1,I followed this book to the letter but it didn't work,"Sorry folks, it just doesn't work, we tried it all.I have to agree with one of the other readers who rated this book and say that you cannot manipulate mother nature. If anything the book is worth it...for the fun it adds to trying. Definantly...as the the book recommends...if you are not going to ultimately be happy with either sex don't try any sex manipulation techniques. Although we were wishing for a girl we were blessed with our third son. We couldn't have been blessed with a happier or more beautiful baby."
3,You've got a 50/50 chance!,I was very excited to try this book out for our 2nd child. We followed everything exactly to the tee for a boy- which is said to be easier than a girl. Although I found this book to be very interesting and educational about the reproductive cycle it did NOT work for me. I am the type of person that follows the directions exactly so the only room for error is in the method itself. Think about it this way- if it was foolproof wouldn't more people and countries be doing it? Either way- you've got a 50/50 chance so it's right half of the time. Good luck either way- there's no harm in trying!
1,It's 50/50 whether you like it or not.,"We burned this book in the fireplace today. We have two boys and wanted to have a little girl. We followed the method perfectly, doing everything suggested. I even had my ovulation date confirmed as I was at an OB appointment she checked and told me I had just ovulated or was about to. It didn't work. We're having our 3rd boy. We will love him as much as our other boys. But if you are looking for hope in this book, it's still a 50/50 chance each time you have a child. My husand, who has a PhD in genetics, was always skeptical of the methods."
1,Not true for me!!,"I used all of his methods for conceiving a boy, positioning, timing, douching...you name it and Yup, you guessed it! My DAUGHTER is due this summer. I realize that there is always a failure rate but in hindsight I think it's silly to ""try"" to conceive a child of a specific gender. I just count my lucky stars that my child is healthy! So, don't waste your time and money with this book!"
2,It did not work for me,"My Mother actually used this method trying to conceive a son. It did not work for her. I guess that is for the best, because if it had worked I wouldn't have been born. My husband and I charted for months and followed the plan for a boy. At my 15 week scan it appears that I will be having a girl. The one great thing about trying for a boy with Shettles, is he makes it very easy to get pregnant. Good luck everyone. wishing you all happy, healthy babies."
2,Not a Believer,"My husband and I both wanted our first child to be a boy. After six months of doing everything described in the book TO THE LETTER, I still wasn't pregnant. We followed the timing, used ovulation predictor kits, had intercourse in the described position, and followed all of the guidelines. NOTHING. After six months of frustration, my husband and I decided that we would be happy with a boy or girl, we just wanted a baby. We went back to doing things the old-fashioned way ... and BOOM, we got pregnant after one try. An ultrasound has just confirmed that the baby we're expecting is a BOY! Even though we basically did everything the opposite of what the book instructed in an effort to just get preganant with ANY baby.This book has some useful information about conception, and basic facts about acidity/alkilinity that I thought were interesting. Sadly, however I do not believe that this method has any bearing on sex selection."
1,Disappointed,"Our daughter was six and we were ready to finally have the boy my husband wanted so much. I found Dr. Shettle's method on the internet and was so excited. I thought for sure it would work. We followed the instructions to a T and ended up having a girl. So much for that. I wouldn't trade her for anything. But when you have your heart set on something and really believe it, it is a letdown when it doesn't happen."
3,"Interesting reading, but not an exact science!!","Got this book after my daughter was born so we could see what we could do about making #2 a boy to have the ""perfect family"".It is interesting reading, tells you everything you ever needed to know (and more!) about conception.So we followed the formula EXACTLY and got- A beautiful bouncing healthy baby GIRL!!! Not disappointed at all (healthy is all that counts Kids!!) but don't bet the house on it.I'll use it again to try for a boy next time, but don't have much hope it will work any better than just doing it naturally."
5,Batting 1000,"It is my pleasure to report that by using the methods described in Dr. Shettles book my wife and I planned for and conceived our beautiful daughter Chloe. Two years later we planned for and conceived our beautiful son Landon. As a licensed health care practitioner I am convinced these methods work, they worked for me and my wife. Now that we have both a boy and a girl, we have decided that we have completed our family."
1,Sounds better than it is,"We bought this book to try to conceive a girl after two wonderful boys. You could set your watch by my cycles (seriously) and I followed it 100%. I mean absolutely to the letter.It failed.But the good news is, I'm pregnant with our third and last child, and our baby boy is healthy (so far, 30 weeks yesterday!) and I'm realizing that's what counts!"
5,It worked! 3 Girls & Now a Boy!,"I just wanted to say that this book was very helpful.I have 3 girls and wanted a boy b/c I knew this would be my last child... I bought this book.. Read the most important stuff for me... ""What to eat & what not to eat"", ""The best positions.."".I did what the book said & low & behold... After having 3 girls, I am now 6 months pregnant with my son...Good Luck to You."
4,"Good, solid info","I feel like the information given in this book is no different than what you would find on an extensive internet search, though it is nice to have a hard copy of it. Looking forward to using the knowledge gained from this book in the future."
4,looking forward to trying method,I purchased the book out of curiosity. I currently have 2 healthy boys and am considering try again hopefully for a healthy girl. The book was easy to read and fully explains in detail the do's and don't for whatever sex your trying for. although i have not yet tried the method i would recommend reading the book. hopefully in a few months i'll try for my girl. wish me luck!
4,It's complicated but I'm convinced,"After having a beautiful baby boy. We're going to try for the ""perfect family"" a girl using the method discribed in the book. Either way there is no harm done. A healthy baby is all that counts."
1,DID NOT WORK FOR US.....!,"In the interest of public service I thought I'll report our experiences with this book. After having had our daughter we bought the book to see if we can increase our chances of conceiving a boy the next time.We read the book and decided to do chart several 'practice cycles' to get to understand my cycle better. I charted all the relevant signs (temperature etc.) and we avoided getting pregnant by avoiding the week before my usual (very regular) ovulation.Unfortunately, during one cycle I did get pregnant and as this happened 4-5 days before my ovulation (confirmed by rising temperature 5 days later), we expected a girl, as Dr Shettles suggests.Guess what, we had a little boy! So, his method is not foolproof and with hindsight, we are glad not to have followed his advice!"
1,DID NOT WORK FOR US!,"After having had our daughter we bought this book to see if we could increase our chances of conceiving a boy the next time. I know my cycles quite well and we decided to do several 'practice' cycles before attempting to conceive. We therefore avoided the week before ovulation and I charted my cycles (temperature, cervical mucus etc). Unfortunately (?) we had intercourse too close to ovulation (about 5 days before) and, with hindsight, not following Shettles' recommendations for a boy (position etc). We therefore expected another girl. Guess what, we had a boy! Luckily we did not follow Dr Shettles recommendations!!!"
5,"intellegent, entertaining and insightful","Ms. Doud is a truly talented writer, whom I feel will go far. The story of Katharine made me look at my own life in a new light. This is a truly excellent book, which I have recommended to many of my friends."
2,Great promise not fulfilled,"When I read about this book, it sounded so interesting I put down the book I was reading at that moment and started reading this one. I was very disppointed after the first few pages. The concept was great; however, the characters became unbelievable. The plot turned out to be boring."
2,"Bland, unfinished....","I'm sorry - normally I only write reviews of books I've enjoyed and found useful, but this book was such a disappointment, I have to put my two stars worth in.The concept is great - I really like the notion of being reincarnated and knowing as a new person what you know now. The idea of coming back in the body of a young junkie, and then helping her out (since you're body is definitely dead, anyway), is also interesting.But after the introduction, this book didn't go where it could have. There are underdeveloped characters, side plots that don't go very far before fizzling off and a bit of incest that is, but isn't.This is Laurel Doud's first novel, and this reads like a first novel with a mediocre editor. If you think you'll like it, borrow it from a friend or from the library.But do look for her second novel - she's got what it takes, she just isn't quite there yet."
2,not worth your time,"This book, ""This Body"", started off really strong and then went no where. I was very disappointed in the ending. I kept waiting for a big climaxing moment and there was none. There are so many other books on there - don't waste your time!"
1,not to mention the regret and remorse of addictive reading,"this was one of the most infuriating reads I can ever remember encountering. Yes, you can't put it down because the premise is so delightful, but in plain words the book is an impossible mess. The book is written in short stops and starts which begin to make you feel your on the LA freeway during rush hour. The end is such a nauseating mess I know for sure that in this rare instance I will not go see the film of a book I read."
4,Interesting and Easy Reading,"I thought that the book had an interseting but not very original premise. However, it was fun to read. The end of the book was a little boring but in general I would recommend this book."
5,What a clever book!,"Every woman's fantasy fulfilled - die and come back richer and thinner and younger. Even with all her problems, Thisby is a person you can like. I look forward to more books by Ms. Doud."
3,"Great start, but fizzles fast","This book had me hooked from the first few pages. The language was so descriptive and the predicament so shocking! I knew I would love this book and I had to find out what happened. The first 1/4 of the book was a real page-turner.I wish I can say this continued throughout. I loved the illusions to Shakespeare and that tie in was interesting, however the plot got stale. The ending was unfulfilling and somewhat depressing."
4,Incredibly unique!,This novel was refreshingly interesting and certainly worth the read. I could relate very easily to the subject matter and I found its entirety very well written. This being the authors first novel I hold high hopes for her next work.
2,Not very useful,"The first problem with this book, is that the pages measure 6.5 by 8.5. making it feel like a small telephone directory. The photographs show portions of rooms that are simply too miniscule to appreciate; the context in which they are situated is not displayed. I found myself frowning a lot and feeling somewhat baffled.Also, I question the relevence of including close-ups of flowers, or fruit, or a long blank wall with a tiny window at the end of it. It's very irritating. Also, most of these homes are apartments which feature ultra-contemporary furnishings - cupboards with no knobs, couches that look like surf boards, etc. Only a few of the homes could be described as cozy and inviting and they were the best pictures, in my opinion.Ultimately, the smallness of the pictures ruined it for me - I hate having to squint at a photo. A better book is the New Decorating Book (2002, I believe) by Better Homes & Gardens. A true feast for the eyes."
2,"Nice photos, not very helpful","Although it gives some style suggestions it is almost useless if you have less than 500 square feet (whichs studios in NYC generally are smaller than). If you are looking for some helpful ways to reconsider your small space, I'd recommend ""Apartment Therapy."" If you want some nice photos, then try this book."
2,Does anyone LIVE like this?,"Seriously, the book is beautifully photographed and the rooms are very well designed if you like rooms where no one actually has to LIVE...I think from an purists' point of view, this is a great study of design but if you are looking for a book to give you actual, usable ideas for re-designing your condo space - get a different book. I regret buying it as I was looking for more than a visually stunning coffee table book (which it definitely qualifies as). I was looking for realistic design ideas.Each of the spaces looks like no one has or ever COULD live in them.But, if you have tons of money and no personal possessions, this might give you some useable ideas."
1,My bad?,"Perhaps it's my misunderstanding of the purpose of this book. or the implication of the title. In sum, it's stuffed with pretty pictures of overdecorated spaces - and nothing, & I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G remotely useful for utilizing small spaces.I thought I was purchasing a book on interior design, instead, it's strictly interior decoration - & more often than not - embarrassingly self-conscience decoration at that. A complete & utter waste of money for anyone researching small space design solutions."
2,no bathrooms!,I don't know why this book indicates that bathrooms are included inside? There are like two pictures of bathrooms and they are both at poor angles. Do people not use the loo in small spaces? i guess i'll go bathe in the ocean!
1,please be aware,"I realize that alot of people gave good reviews for this book.But please be aware, that this book is for people who havea zero budget for decorating. This book is not for peoplewho want beautiful design. It's for very simple people whocannot afford a large home or high quality furnishings."
2,"Pretty and Informative, But Not a How-To","This book has lovely pictures and good information; but the problem I found with it is that it is not the how-to for living in small spaces that I was looking for.Several of the homes are more art project than living space. I agree with a previous reviewer who noted that few of houses seemed inviting, comfortable, or very functionable for every-day life.If you are a student, as I am, looking for a practicle guide to living in a small area, such as a dorm or first apartment, this book is of little use. If you have the time, money, ambition, and know-how to redesign your small living-space, this book may offer some good ideas."
4,Nice Book,This is a nice book and gives you some ideas on how to save space. Unfortunately almost all of the occupants in this book are architects or are friends with an architect. I can't afford to have an architect help me with my apartment space so it doesn't really apply. I still like the book though.
4,Simply Talented,"As the Mom of the fantastically talented, pre-Eryykah Badu, Neo-Soul Sister, Adriana Evans, Mary Stallings reigns a champ. Between the two, talent is in the DNA. And, Manhattan Moods is a testament to Mom's talent and the gift she passes down to her daughter. She blows a set of strong pipes; her voice, still quite clear. There is no need to resort to stunts. While I am a fan of Stallings' debut music--despite what people say about her rawness, I like it; find it to be her authenticity, proving her ability to break through a longstanding tradition--I enjoy her maturity on Manhattan Moods. Queen Stallings' covers of these jazz standards display a commitment to convention. Yet, her style and vocal skills make her renditions creatively savvy. Track 4 How High the Moon is simply lovely, peaceful and romantic. Stallings is a foremother."
1,Not enjoyable for my 19 mo old son,"We got Little Touch Leappad for DS's first birthday and he is now 19 mos old. His favorite book is ""If I were.."" because he likes the pictures of the animals and the animal sounds.HOWEVER, he doesn't like ""Guess How Much I Love You"" at all because it doesn't hold his attention. I think it was a waste of money.Basically ""Guess How Much I Love You"" is the same as the regular story book of the same name. Leapfrog added sounds, of course, but the don't fit in well with the pictures. The focus is on instruments and the sounds they make.If you have a small six month old baby, then this is the book you should buy because it the gentlest of the Leappad books. However, for a toddler, it is just too dull."
3,Mainly Just Tells the Story,"It's great if you just want your child to hear a story, but it's not as educational and exciting as all of the other Littletouch books."
2,No interest,"This is not an interesting Leap Pad book for my 16 month old. He has an interest in instruments, but not in this book. Even my attempts to use it before bed to calm/soothe him have failed. Better off with others books in the group."
2,Not as much fun at 14 months,"Out of all the books we have purchased for our Little Touch - this is the one my child does not enjoy. It is too slow for my 3 year old to have much patience with. Maybe I've read the board book to them too often and it makes this one drag. Also, the pages wrinkle easily (as do all the books for this product.)"
4,A little pricey but worth it,"This was a little pricey but much cheaper than some of the other vendors. The book is exactly as I expected: sweet, cute and with an English narrator. It has the characteristic muted iilustrations so not the attention grabber of some of the other volumes, but it is a classic."
2,Boring,I was very disappointed with this book. My 19 month old daughter walked away after one minute. She liked the book that came with the Little Touch Leap Pad better. I worked with it for a little while to see if there would be anything interesting but it was just plain boring. This was a waste of money.
5,Bulb Upgrade,I had a factory halogen bulb in my motorcycle. After a bit of research I bought the Silver Star bulb. The ST series bulb was much brighter and whiter than the yellow tint of the fractory bulb. Great upgrade.
1,Not worth the time and money. Not even 2 months of use.,"One of my 9003ST blew within 2 months. I use them as Daytime Driving light. I got about 100 hours of use from that bulb. I'm just waiting for other one to blow any moment. The bulb's coiled filament didn't even show sign of use. The filament split cleanly in the center of the coil and left with half the coil intact. The bulb glass has no discoloration at all. Other than it's bad life expectancy(supposedly between 6 to 12 months}, these bulbs have vibration issues. My OEM bulb lasted 4 years exactly. And I also use them as Daytime Driving light."
3,Wiring options?,One thing that i really didn't like about this fan was the fact that you could not hard wire it with a different switch kit. I have a lutron system in my apt that i wanted to incorporate( because the remote that comes with the fan is hideous). Tech support was no help since they claim its impossible to wire it differently.
4,Good looking and quiet fan.,This fan looks good and operates very quietly. I purchased the light kit as well. Few shortcomings:1) No way to wire to a switch and no wall switch offered by Hunter. Strange because the fan includes parts to allow for a pull chain. The remote is one that hangs on the wall and is ugly. I rewired the receiver to use a wall switch to control the fan and lights instead of the remote.2) As mentioned in other reviews the plate mounting screws are worthless and strip very easily. Be very careful tightening these screws. I ended up replacing these.3) When installing the black mounting bracket into the ceiling bracket make sure you install the 3 curved rubber isolators correctly. The instructions aren't clear on this and it is easy to miss.
5,the best of the best,"For anyone who has ever used Campbell Soups for recipes, or ever wanted to see just how to do the classics like green bean casserole or squash casserole, this is a must have.Clear, simple recipes that don't take hours - my kind of cookbook - think you will find the same."
4,Great Shovel,"Great shovel, no work on your back. Living in Northern NY with lake effect would have bought the larger size in hindsight."
5,Clears my drive better than neighbors snowblower,"I just moved from the south to an area with 60 inches of snow annually. I wasn't really sure if this would do the trick and if I needed to buy a snowblower someday. I'm 100% satisfied, no heavy equipment needed. Easy to use, will probably last forever if not left outside."
4,Worth getting,The main advantgage to this shovel is that you rarely have to lift it. I found that I could shovel a lot more with a lot less exertion.
5,the best,The best small book ever. I want more copies. How come there arent any available? This title should have had broader distribution.
2,Will let you know,"So far not too impressed...The elixir is not evenly on the wand (like mascara wand).Have had to comb it back through, move it around, shake and ...What a hassle and for what?! Nothing!Wish I would of bought my usual Rapid Lash.That product worked great but I was trying to save mula.Next time I will spend the $49 for the Rapid Lash and regrow mylashes to their former status, as the ""BIG Sweepers"" my sister,friends, and boyfriend have named them!"
1,Animal Dance - to what music??,"I bought this for my 13-month old son today and was disappointed. Given the title, I thought this book would have playful sing-along or dance-along type songs, but it doesn't. It isn't very musical or fun. It's not a cohesive story either...but worse, I couldn't even find a single page that I thought my son would like (after he walked away uninterested).Setting 2 was especially boring, mostly naming objects & animals saying short phrases; setting 3 had a little more personality and maybe some really short songs. I suppose it could be educational for an older child, but I'm not keeping it to see.A fun book that I enjoy a lot w/ my young toddler is ""Rainbow Fish 1,2,3"". It's much more fun and musical, even though it's actually a counting book!"
5,Great learning tool,I purchased these books for my neice who is 17 months to help her learn and have fun at the same time. She loves them.
2,Duplicate Item B000JSI7WG,"I picked up a copy of this DVD (matching the cover art pictured) elsewhere for much less than the $79.00 Amazon is asking. I've had it in my Wishlist for a long time but couldn't find a justification for the price for a single-disk DVD. It also appears to be the same item as B000JSI7WG (""24"" Behind the Scenes - The Editing Process, $17.99), which is the item that came up when I entered the UPC number into Delicious Library. This item appears to be an earlier release at educational-materials pricing and the other is a re-release at general market price.Two stars, as it appears to be overpriced. I feel sad for those trying to sell it used at nearly the same price."
4,Extremely useful resource,"This book is well layed out and organized in terms of topics. Reviewing the questions was a tremendous help for me in going through the interview process. I was able to leverage the questions and answers in my interviews and definitely helped lead to a job offer.This should not be your only resource, but it was and is a very useful one. I highly recommend this book!!"
2,Good for some laughs,If you're looking for a real super-hero movie then this is NOT for you! It's kinda a sad film if you stay with it(if you can)seeing that a great actor-Tony Curtis would want to be remembered for a film like this.
3,Good But Not Great,"While I enjoyed the book (it was quick and entertaining escape), it was not the author's best effort. Do not get me wrong, the book is a fun read. However, I did not think the bad guys were particularly well developed, and Conan's character seemed to flip-flop between being an ale-swilling loser to being a hard-fighting barbarian with a conscience (in my opinion, its always better for a real ""good guy"" to win). Go ahead and read this book, but then read ""Conan The Destroyer."""
3,A pretty simple affair,"As one might expect, this album is not a big production. It is simply about 23 minutes of sparsely instrumented arrangements of hymns. Karen Peris' vocals are prominent in the mix, with sometimes some quiet guitar, piano, or string bass in the background. For those of us who love her quavery childlike voice, it is much easier to make out in these arrangements. In particular, the rolled R's which I have only started noticing with ""Birds of my neighborhood"" are distractingly obvious in this recording.About half of the hymns are limited to a single verse, for example ""It is well with my soul"". I am glad to say the beautiful harmony of that song is preserved in this arrangement. I would have enjoyed hearing more of the harmonies in the other hymns. One of the things I like best about ""The Lakes of Canada"" from ""Birds of my neighborhood"" is the overdubbed harmony -- hearing that beautiful voice in harmony with itself is a real pleasure."
4,You will Dig This!,"Whether you're a fan of the sounds of men like Johnny Hartman, Nat King Cole and Tony Bennett, or the up-tempo style of Bobby Darin, You'll love Dennis Rowland. Living here in Phoenix I have the opportunity to see him live on occasion and his range is incredible. He sang with Count Basie's orchestra for the last few years of the Count's life, and handles those classics with ease as well as collaborations with current masters like Joe Sample.Check it out!"
5,He Gets It,"I concur with both the previous reviewers, and can only add that Mr. Rowland is a worthy successor to the great Joe Williams, but more cool, like Miles, in fact. Back in East L.A. they'd have called his voice ""rico-suave"". He has the music understood. The musicians he sings with also are on target. If you liked the original Miles Quintet albums, you'll thank your stars for this one. Buy it."
1,offensive and uninformed,"Hewitt seems knowledgable when speaking about self mutilation and eating disorders, however once she begins to speak about body adornment, she is obviously in over her head. Her use of terminology when talking especially about body piercing and tattoos is unclear and confusing, as if she isn't sure what the correct terms are. The title of this book is EXTREMELY offensive to myself and anyone else who has tattoos, piercings, brands or decorative scars despite her attempt to defend her choice of words in the introduction. It is also badly edited (which does not reflect on the author).I found several mistakes in subject-verb agreement and other things which should have been picked up by the editor. If there even was one."
3,FOR THE LOVE OF LUCY.,"In this, the second film directed by a very young Garson Kanin, Lucille Ball plays Nancy, a gal who's in love with Lee Bowman, a foreigner: she will inherit an incredible $20 million provided she gets herself a ""real"" American husband. James Ellison plays the ditch-digging Yank Lucy chooses to hitch in order to grab the cabbage - and then rush for Reno in order to get a quickie divorce... Bickering and battling with each other, the duo endure a wild trailer ride en route to Nevada (which is reminiscent of that in THE LONG, LONG TRAILER) & there is the predictable outcome. Implausible but enjoyable nevertheless, there is a lot of action which goes on without any rhyme or reason, but Ball (her eyebrows are a'la Harlow or Dietrich here) is in fine form and she and Ellison play well together. This little flick was actually considered RKO's best ""B"" comedy of 1938 - which isn't saying all that much."
5,Old Favorite!,I ordered this used book for my daughter to share with my grandson. Our family has owned a copy for years and years. It was always brought out at Christmas time and put away the remainder of the year. I'm glad I did that because now the book is out of print and difficult to find. Peter Spier depicts a family Christmas perfectly right down to the mounds of wrapping paper on the floor afterwards. The book is just illustrations so even the youngest can enjoy it. Some company should reprint the book so more children can enjoy it.
4,EAV- Unbedingt hörenswert!,Eine typische CD der EAV. Kenner und Liebhaber ihrer Musik werden sie lieben. Typisch satirische Texte verpackt in einen echt tollen Sound.
5,great guide to Portland,"Whether you live in Portland or are visiting for an extended time or have just moved, this is an excellent guide to the Rose City. Everything from shopping, restaurants, recreation, sites of interest, etc. You name it, this book covers it. Want to find a new place to go out to dinner? Look here. Want to figure out where to take a visiting friend from out of town? Look here. This is an excellent guide to all aspects of living, working, and playing in Portland. The one shortcoming this book has is that it has very limited coverage of the surrounding metro area. If it's not in Portland, it's probably not in this book."
1,Poor Effort from the French,"On receipt of this film and haveing viewed all the way through, I can only say that i have rarely seen a more disappointing and boring film.The storyline is poor, the action banal and anyone who buys this rubbish needs their head examining."
5,A good low-maintenance filter for small tanks,"I use this filter in a 10-gallon tank for my turtles, and am so glad I did. I used to have a Duetto filter similar tothis one, but the turtle food kept getting sucked into the filter and gunking up all the internal parts, which included two sponges, a charcoal cartridge and three plastic parts that made up the filter cage.This filter, not counting suction cups, has four parts: a motor unit, a sponge, and a two-part plastic casing that contains the sponge and attaches to the motor unit. That means there is only one part that needs replacing -the sponge- instead of three in the Duetto. It is also very easy to disassemble and clean, taking roughly one-quarter of the time of any other filter I have used.Just one word of caution - this is a small filter. I would not use it in even a mid-sized aquarium, but for small aquariums this is one of the best filters out there."
3,Mr. Rogers Neighborhood - 'Radical Music For Docile Minds' (Captain Trip),"First CD by the Japanese power-punk outfit. Nothing out-standing here, but definitely a worthy dose of aggressive punk rock. Tunes that tend to (sort of) draw one in are ""Greetings And Salutations"", ""Government Clone"", the *ss-kicking ""I'm On Medication"" and ""Terminal Interface"". Line-up: Bob Rogers - acoustic guitar & vocals, Ken Matsutani (Marble Sheep) - guitar & backing vocals, Dickie Peterson (Blue Cheer, R.I.P.) - bass, Andrew McDonald (Blue Cheer) - guitar, Hirokazu Furukawa - keyboards, David Neale - sax, Yasuyuki Watanabe - drums and Rie Miyazaki & Rod Derring - backing vocals. Enjoy."
3,"Contrived, but mercifully short","I liked the beginning of this book, but I never really believed in the characters or felt any of their emotions. The writing is good, if a bit facile. Everything just perks along, through death and even the Holocaust, to a sweet, happy ending."
2,Plot line is way too crammed in,"I thought the book had a good start, but it quickly drops off. The characters are shallow, and everything happens exactly how you expect. The conflict isn't evolved enough either."
5,"Witty, Endearing","This story will show you that love has no boundaries. We follow Natalie from being a young girl and into womanhood. The ending is so wonderful. You won't be able to put this book down, and when it's done you'll yearn for more."
1,Jewish girl pines to be Gentile says it all,"I agree with other lipman fans that this one was all downhill after girl grows up. Like others, I found the ""let's marry Christians"" Jewish theme shallow and offensive. As if marrying blue eyes and a down vest is an answer to antisemitism. Characters shallow and plot predictable and cliched. Her style still carries you through, but it left me with a sour taste in my mouth."
1,Superficial and offensive,"I loved how this book began--the concept of getting even for the smarmy and self-righteous anti-Semitism that has lasted much too long in the world really grabbed me. However, as the book progressed and I saw what the inevitable outcome would be, I was disgusted at the trivialization of the dilemma of modern Jews--that is, to live in the world but to be true to their religion, they must marry another Jew. Natalie's family is not observant, is only culturally Jewish, yet they are horrified at the idea of their daughter marrying out of the faith. This is upsetting enough, because if the parents don't instill knowledge and love of Judaism, they can't expect their children to value it enough to marry within the faith. That said, the treatment of the romance smacks of forbidden fruit, and it is just like most TV shows which portray intermarried couples in a shallow and comedically cynical manner.I was offended and disappointed by this book and would not recommend it."
4,You don't have to be Jewish,"I really don't care for specialty-group books: mother-daughters, sisterhoods, working moms, etc.; I had this figured to be a good library check-out book, as in, don't spend any money on it, because you probably end up having to be East-coast Jewish to really get a good read out of it. Wrong. The positives already expressed still apply. Lipman is a skilled author who develops character and situational drama so skillfully that all other ""specialty"" elements (religion, cooking, etc.) take a back seat to the entirely fun and riveting read.So, if you are a west coast protestant who really doesn't enjoy cooking or resort life, read this book for the sheer light, can't-put-down, literary pleasure!"
2,unfulfilled expectations,"I loved the first part of this book. It really started off with a bang. After that, it took several strange plot turns. The tone switched to soap opera. I almost quit, but I kept reading, expecting more resolution to the initial anti-Semetic issue. That really fizzled out, and I was disappointed in the end."
4,Great Story Telling,"Elinor Lipman is a great and dependable story teller. The protagonist in this story is a very likeable character, and the plot has enough twists and turns to keep the reader pulled in. This is, in some ways, a coming of age story. It is also a historical time piece, and has a good deal of depth to it. It is a fast and fulfilling book."
5,A CLASSIC!,"What a book! Because she was compared to Jane Austen, I had to see what the deal with Elinor LIpman is and I must say that that is a fitting description. Her hand is deft but not heavy, with just enough humor thrown in to dissaude you from thinking she's being TOO serious about it all- ""it all"" being love, loss, and civil rights."
4,"My first Elinor Lipman, but certainly not my last!","I stumbled upon this gem of a novel one day and decided to pick it up. It then sat on my bookshelf for over a year in the pile of ""books i must read"". I finally picked it up a few days ago and I really wished I had done so much sooner. I didn't have any idea of what to expect but I was immediately drawn into this story of a young girl who is taken aback by the anti-Semitism of an inn she and her family wish to stay at one summer. The impact this has on her life is far reaching and the journey she takes is one I relished to take with her. I enjoyed all of the different characters and their relationships and was thoroughly surprised at some of the twists in this delightful novel. Looking for a good beach read that's fast paced but not too fluffy? Then this book's for you!"
2,A little light read,"This book was ""Highly Recommended"" in last Sunday's San Francisco Chronicle, and the story sounded just up my alley, so I was very excited to read it. I read the book in just over two days--a very easy read, and I found that while I enjoyed the story, there was little depth to any of the characters, and everything was very, very predictable. The most poignant moment was in the acknowledgements at the back of the book where the author thanked her mother for remembering a letter that she had received long ago. The book had the potential to be quite wonderful--it's an interesting subject and was set in an interesting time. It just didn't do too much for me."
2,strong start; very disappointing fininsh,"I purchased this book on the strength of the first chapter, excerpted here at amazon.com. That chapter, and the succeeding 50 pages or so, were funny--a great read. Ms. Lipman's portrayal of the protagonist as a young girl infuriated by the ""genteel"" anti-semitism of a Vermont innkeeper really resonated with me, a transplanted Mainer who happens to be Jewish. But following a significant plot twist (which I'll not reveal here), the book goes decidedly downhill. The story becomes very formulaic, the characters introduced beyond that point are predictable and unidimensional, as is the rest of the story. It was as if Ms. Lipman lost interest in writing this book and was doing as little as she could to please a demanding publisher. If she could have sustained the energy of the first chapters, this would have been a great summer read. As it is, forget it."
2,Not Lipman's best,I'll reread any of Lipman's books multiple times - except this one. Boring and disappointing finish.
5,Another winner!,"Elinor Lipman is a full-hearted writer with a magic pen. I always look forward to a new book by her, knowing that I'll laugh hard and learn a thing or two about the human spirit. Every single one of her books is a gem, and this one, perhaps because of the Lipmanesque (read: cockeyed) view of bigotry, shines brightest of all."
4,Funny--Heartbreaking--Until the end,"This book was great...It was a quick read and had many funny points...However, towards the end, it takes a turn towards the fanciful (sp?)...For those of you how have read it, remember the mushroom fiasco? The worst couldn't have happened because that would have totally ruined the point of the book...Truthfully, I think the book would have been just as good without that whole ordeal... Despite this one minor flaw, I found the book to be an enjoyable read...Pick it up..."
3,Only so-so,"I'm a fan of Elinor Lipman's books ""Isabel's Bed"" and especially ""Then She Found Me"" which I thought was wonderful. This one was kind of disappointing. The characters did not seem as complex and the plot was kind of thin. I was annoyed by the romances and friendships which all seemed to lack real emotion. The parts I liked the best took place when the narrator was a young girl - that's when she was the most real and the most entertaining to me."
3,"Young Jewish woman in New England, fish out of water.",This novel by Elinor Lipman is light easy reading. Definitely a beach book. I believe it could have been more ethnic and more funny.
4,"Really, really cute","Calling Elinor Lipman's work ""cute"" is a bit of injustice, but that's just how I felt about this book. After reading this, I felt the same way I feel coming out of a great romantic comedy movie, all warm and fuzzy inside.The book follows Natalie Marx who becomes intrigued/obsessed with an Inn who, when she was a child, did not allow her family to vist because they were Jewish. Natalie whowever, manages to find a way into the Inn through non-Jewish friends, and her commentary about the Inn and it's visitors, and the family who graciously allows her to vacation with them is hilarious. (And the gentile hottie Natalie becomes involved with is a pretty cool storyline too).The back of this book contains a quote from the Chicago Tribune calling it a ""punchy little comedy of manners. . .Think Jane Austen"" and although way too many female authors get compared to ""modern-day Jane Austens"" this description actually fits. I highly recommend this book."
1,Nothing to offer,"This was a difficult book to finish. I found the syle childish, and the characters to be exteremly one dimensional. I must admit that the author was able to pull me in for the first chapter (which may be due to the fact that it was autobiographical to some extent), but the book dragged on after that. At the end, I didnt care about any of the characters, and was suprised I made it through to the end."
2,"Ummm.... Summer Reading, If The Beach Is Closed...","The protagonist is rather obnoxious, though given, her crusade is a righteous one. To fight anti-semitism is a noble thing; to set out to destroy the anti-semite, perhaps, is not. I was left wondering whether true love had conquered all, or true revenge."
2,Not worth paying for,"GD USA is a monthly magazine targeted at, and available free to, professionals within the graphic design community. It consists overwhelmingly of promotional material - advertising, company profiles, personal profiles, and so on. If you are not in the business, you will find little of interest here. If you ARE in the business, you can get the magazine free from their website."
1,Save Your Time,"I agree with the others in that this magazine is too content-filled with the most irrelevant content! The copy is way heavy, but few true words of wisdom. It showcases VERY little work by other graphic designers so if you're looking to peruse the latest talent, definitely stick with CA or HOW."
2,An unholy alliance,"Attempts to convey a spiritual awakening via one's travels to exotic locales has been the staple of many a good read. Andrew Harvey's JOURNEY TO LADAKH, and Robert Byron's THE STATION are 2 of the most noteworthy. Alas Mathew Spencer's stay at the Holy Mountain has not produced such a book. Firstly, as it is written based on a 1993 visit, it is out of date. Much of the monasteries have undergone changes, both visually and internally due to EU funding. And he doesn't convey the spiritual practice that you would think necessary to achieve some form of enlightenment. As an outsider to Orthodoxy, he never gets into the skin of its theatrics. However he does ground his writing in historical context, and provide a knowledgeable background to monasticism. A shame then that it doesn't transcend the already known."
4,nice music for long drives,"husky voice, good melody and thought provoking words, this album is worth the investment of time and money."
5,Amazing,This is the most amazing CD I've ever heard. Beth Hart is a musical genius and I love her to death. Because of this CD I plan to buy her other CDs. There is so much emotion in each song and it really does 'lift you up'.
4,Great bluesy singer,I loved her song on the Kennedy Awards and just had to have her CDs. Her quivering voice is exceptional.
2,Not quite what I thought - 2 1/2 stars,"I investigated Ms. Hart after hearing her on ""American Made World PlayedLes Paul & Friends"" where she had a cut with Neal Schon titled ""I Wanna Know You"". After hearing her on this cut - I had to dig deeper. Her voice is amazing. This album, however, is very disappointing. She should be singing ""bluesy"" material with her vocal talents. The material on this album is just too average. I will say the last half of the album is better than the 1st half. Maybe I just choose the wrong album??"
2,Another not easy to understand weather book,"I was really excited when buying this book, because it looked like it will be easy read and I can finally understand the basics that I can use during my sailing trips.I found this book not very well outlined, and not easy to understand at all.I will keep looking for the one"
2,Wrong edition,"Don't order this book if you want the newer, larger, North American edition that the first reviewer (""This edition is...etc"") is describing. The book for sale on this page is the older, smaller edition focused on Brittain. I don't know why Amazon put the wrong review on the page, but it's pretty misleading.It's also not worth $19, in my opinion. It may be more useful for a European reader, but even then is pretty skimpy and cursory.I've asked Amazon to exchage it for the newer edition, which sounds like it may be better."
2,cosmic psycho babble,"after all the flowery reviews by superliterate amazonians, I in my troubled relationship, felt this would possibly help me become closer. Eva is a very spiritual person. Sees the great duality of life and its conflicts in a very theistic and heavily buddhist influenced eastern way. So, for reading its very absorbing, but for practical everyday help with yourdown to earth practical problems, if you're not a philosopher studying romance, this probably isn't the guide to your solution (or mine). but to acknowledgesomething is missing in the fulfillment dept with youand your partner is a big step in the right direction, keep searching. I was really happy with David Richo."
3,The Prisoner of Azkaban (French),"For those of you who have only read books one and two and were wondering what the big deal is all about, book three is where JK Rowling begins to hint at the depth of the entire wizarding world that she has created. Book three, like books one and two, is not all too satisfying as a story unto itself, but it is entertaining and it sets the stage for the action in books four, five, six, and seven. I suspect that this particular French edition does cut out a few minor details here and there (nothing that is crucial to the overall plotline), but perhaps these details would not have made much sense for those not too familiar with British quotidian life."
5,"finding the real perpetrators, and the real victims","Goes way beyond blaming individuals for the horror of abuse, and holds the violent culture that abuse is embedded in accountable. Doesn't let individuals perpetrators off the hook, but is a window into the mechanism that produces them. Other people have addressed the topic of abuse and violence, but perhaps not as comprehensively as this book. Scary topic, but information and viewpoints needed to address this systemic illness."
2,There's better Walcott Footage,"I got this because I'm a fan of Jennifer Walcott. She only had one okay scene in it. Deana Brooks was good. Get Celebrity Photographers if you like Walcott (she's better as a brunette). Get Playmates Unwrapped if you like cool gimmicy clips and a better line-up of girls (Jennifer Walcott, Kimberly Stanfeild, Buffy Tyler, and Shannon Stewart). Get this only if you love legs and artsy type clips."
2,Disappointed,"I thought this one had a good line up of girls. Anytime you throw Deanna Brooks into the mix it is always good. But there was only one section with Deanna, and you hardly see much of her at all. The rest of the clips were mostly unarousing. I don't want art, I want naked chicks! I'll go to a museum if I want to see works of art.Another thing that really annoyed me about this DVD is that a lot of the camera shots didn't show the whole girl at once. It kind of panned down low, then eventually moved slowly up to her face. I'll be the first to admit that what I do while I watch these DVDs is pretty much what you expect somebody who buys a DVD for the naked women to do--but I am a pauser. I like to pause when there is a good shot of the whole girl, from head to toe so you can see her pretty face, and her goodies, all in one shot. With this DVD it is very difficult to do that."
1,PLAYBOY BREAKS NO GROUND AS USUAL,"This is very tame and lame film as you would have guessed from playboy. You actually see more on late night cinemax than in this overedited poor feature. SKIP UNLESS YOU LIKE FAKE BREASTS,BLONDE BLEACHED HAIR AND NO EROTIC FOOTAGE!"
1,Audio book is really radio show segments.,"This is a review of the audio tape edition, not the book. The audio tape is not an abridgement of the book. The audio tape is a collection of radio appearances by the authors. If you read the box, you'd see that. But the description on-line does not make that clear. I think giving the radio show transcripts the same title as the book is deceptive. The presentation is rambling because they just respond to caller questions. They emphasize the relation between depression and a chemical called ceratonen (seratonen?). This tape is not worth getting."
1,A thoughtful yet lacking self help book,Time and time again authors attempt to lead readers to health and hapiness through proselytization. Though thoughtfully worded at times one must realize that hapiness depends upon one's self and one's self image rather than from external sources.
5,Essentials of Dental Assisting,"I find this book excellent for anyone starting in the field of dental assistant or as a review book for someone who is already an assistant. I am just learning and borrowed the book and had to buy it. It covers everything in detail from anatomy,infection control,patient care, radiography, all forms of denistry procedures needed and much more. There are exercises and flash cards and 623 pages full of information. A GREAT BOOK. Its a must for any dental assistant. There are alot of pictures, layouts and diagrams. I enjoy every minute of it."
5,For women of all ages!,"This book is on my shopping list for the holidays for all the important women in my life, regardless of age. Whether you are pre-adololescent or pre-menopausal this book speaks straight to the heart of womanhood. It's playful and joyful, honest and poignant, and most importantly sends a message of hope to women, young and old celebrating the power of connecting with our feminine spirit. Go buy it! (And keep a copy for yourself...)"
3,Forced writing but good information,"I felt at times like the author was pulling out his thesaurus to make the book sound more ""scholarly"". It seemed forced and it was hard to read at times. The book was full of great information and added to my understanding of the era."
3,"Not for beginners, or is it?","This book can be very difficult to follow and frustrating if you do not already know the Photoshop interface and tools very well. The instructions are not very detailed which means you have to figure out how to do a lot of things on your own. The cover does say it is a ""guide to advanced design features"" but it documents the very basics (though not very clearly) so a good part of it might be a waste for advanced users. The book is done only in b/w so you have to imagine a lot of the effects."
2,no support,"The game used to be good but now you can hardly ever get to log in, the game as been down for 4 days now,and the support never answer any of your questions you send them,the amount of players that have dropped out in recent times tell you the state of the game and the developers have never progressed with the game,yet after all this its still addictive but with all the problems the developers are having with it at the moment i wouldnt be suprised if the plug is pulled on the game...."
4,Teaching Bible Stories in a Fun Way,Designed for children five and up this is a story about forgiveness. Coleman finds his little sister chewing on his sock and rescues it. His sock friend Sockariah reminds him of the story of Joseph and how he learned to forgive.This is one in a series of stories. The stories are the result of experiences that the author and his wife have with their own children. The Bible story of Joseph is found in Genesis chpaters 37-47. This book is one of a series in which Coleman learns Bible stories.Child Sockology uses Bible stories and normal kid-things to teach ideas in a fun way. It's the perfect foundation for a lifetime of learning from the Bible.
5,Very helpful,"I needed to teach myself GarageBand and fast. I was in the middle of editing a podcast with Audacity, and it wasn't working for me. GarageBand saved the day--and this book saved it even more. I picked this book up from the library to check it out ... then quickly ordered a copy for myself. It's easy to use, easy to understand, and is a great quick reference tool."
1,YOU CAN FRY AN EGG ON IT,"it gets hot, but it doesn't heat up a traditional coffee mug. AND the surface area isn't big enough for most coffee mugs, most of my mugs don't fit. do not buy this product, i'm sure there's something else out there for your beverage heating needs."
2,Fairly Useless,"I got this as a holiday gift. I thought it was a great idea when I first saw it, but the performance did not live up to the idea. The surface does get warm -- just not warm enough to actually affect the temperature of my tea. Maybe if you were using a very thin china cup, or a metal mug, but the heat just isn't strong enough to get through the traditional ceramic, and I've tried several different cups.It does work right away, when plugged in, there were no problems there, so at least it wasn't broken. I guess."
1,lame,"This warmer is useless. I still use it thinking that it might actually do something, but I am saddened daily by the lack of heat it gives off.The only good thing about it is that it turns on and off as I shut down my computer so I never have to worry about leaving it on. (but in reality it doesnt heat up all that much anyways, so who cares if I leave it on!)"
1,This goes in the trash today! Then I can stop feeling annoyed every time I look at it.,"Ditto, ditto and ditto to all the others - this will not keep your beverage hot thus is absolutely useless, and I wouldn't dream of foisting it off on my favorite charity. If you absolutely must have one, either get a different kind or just go ahead and throw your cash in the trash and save yourself the trouble of buying. I would think electric would be better."
1,terrible,It is too small for most coffee cups. I found one to fit it only find that it didn't keep my coffee warm at all.
1,Wish I had read the rest of the reviews first - its useless,Like others I thought it would be good because I wouldnt have to worry about turning it off and on- it would just turn off when I turn off my computer at work each day. I use dishwater hotter than this thing gets. I literally can put my hand on it without getting burned. I hate that I have to give this even one star. I plan to look for another. I hope there is a different brand of USB warmer out there that gets hot.
3,"Easy to use, but not quite as warm as one would like.",This one just doesn't seem to have the power necessary to really keep a cup of coffee warm. But my guess is that they didn't ramp up the power for safety reasons. Also don't think about using this on an unplugged laptop as it will drain your power in a heartbeat.My recommendation would be just to go with one that plugs into the wall.
1,Not good,While this seemed like a good idea it flunked as being helpful to keep anything warm as it barely heated the plate. I used it several times with no success in slowing the heat from coffee. If anything it sped the cooling. The product found a new home in my garbage can. I wish I had read previous reviews and I would not have ordered it. Total flop.
2,It's a cup warmer alright...and thats all.,"It's a cup warmer alright. The bottom of the cup is the only thing warm... coffee cold. :(I would send back, but that would cost more than the item. Bummer."
1,"Agree, agree, agree","I can only agree with every other review out there. In fact, if I could give it less than 1 star, I would. Not big enough for my mug and doesn't get hot enough to do anything with. The USB ports work, so I guess that is a plus. Maybe it will get warm enough for my candles, but I seriously doubt it. Don't buy!"
1,Does not warm,waste of money ... does not keep coffee hot ... not even warm ... better keep your money and hold the cup in your hand and it will stay warmer ... it looks nice though ... but too expensive as a coaster!
5,Her Best Book So Far,"I am a great Metsy Hingle fan, and this book is her best so far. The characters and plot are believable, the New Orleans background is fun, and the suspense is well crafted. I really enjoyed this one."
4,***,love this series i cant wait to get the next on to add to the collection it arrived in great condition
4,"More ""Dark Shadows"" creepy goodness","There's not much to add to the other enthusiastic comments here, so I'll only say that this sixth collection of ""Dark Shadows"" episodes continues the addictive fun of the first five sets. This particular set is notable for a minimum of dialogue and production flubs, allowing you to just sit back and enjoy- with hardly any chuckle-inducing distractions- the gothic, creepy proceedings. And creepy they are, as these 40 episodes, all set in 1795, show Barnabas Collins' tragically accepting his new fate as one of the undead. All kinds of other interesting things happen, too, both in the supernatural and non-supernatural realms. Interestingly, some of the non-supernatural stuff is just as scary as the supernatural happenings... witness the final fate of Reverend Trask, for example. Anyway, if you enjoyed the previous sets of this series, there's no reason to hesitate in getting this set. Myself, I've already moved onward to the seventh collection!"
3,well-intentioned but blah,"this is a prototype for future encouragement of peace by professional musicians. solti gave us a gripping movie accompaniment in immortal beloved and here acts through his reknown to support his and gergiev's submission of classical music suggesting serious opinion of cherishing peace. it sort of leaves them exposed to criticism, and this is not great. it does set the bar for future dual conductor humanist-themed music, and gives off a unity of theme, but it isn't quality in music-making and will be forgotten except as maybe a clue to structuring a serious, themed work yet not done."
3,"cheap looking, but fair price","The real product looks very cheap, not nearly as nice and shiny as shown in the picture. But I must say the price is appropriate(therefore 3 stars). It does feel sturdy, and should be durable."
3,I know that guy!,"I have never seen the movie, but my family and I are good friends of Tom Dunne. He'll probably kill be if he ever reads this, but a chance to associate oneself with an actor from Hollywood is rare. lol.Anyways, I just felt like saying: I know that guy!"
3,Good. Not great But worth the buy.,"They gave me a pretty long time of service. Out of the box, one clip didn't shut tightly and up to today it never shut tightly as the other two.Now that they're worn (2 years later) I will buy another set because I did absolutely like the way they looked when worn carefully in dress clothing and I can replace the loose clips on the new set, if there are any, with the ones from my last pair.Pretty worth the buy if you get a well made set."
2,"They look good, but broke on the first day",The suspenders look good and come with the ability to clip to pants or connect to buttons inside the waistband. Unfortunately one of the rivets where they connect to the pants failed within the first few hours. Maybe this was a fluke or maybe its because they are poorly constructed.
2,Fell apart,"One of the studs which holds the leather clasp together came unscrewed and was lost. Had to order a second pair for ""parts"". Recommend that you glue the studs in place. Overall they work but are cheaply made."
1,WHERE IS IT?,"I DID NOT RECEIVE THE PRODUCT YET!!!!!!! WHENEVER I RECEIVE IT I CHANGE THE RATING, BECAUSE I CAN'T REVIEW SOMETHING I NEVER RECEIVED!LOOKING FORWARD TO HEAR FROM YOU."
5,money well spent,"i love this product. on chrome, paint, and plastic, flitz has renewed my boat and antique car. it is easy to use and is incredibly effective in restoring dull finishes."
5,Christian Gospel at it's finest!,This album brought me back to my childhood memories of the love of church and family. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Christian Gospel.
5,Wanna be a doctor?,"I watched this documentary with my husband, who was considering attending medical school. Afterwards, even though we'd have lived a life full of large houses, prestige, BMWs, etc, he decided that the status would not be worth the sacrifice. I quite agree with him.The video was exceptionally well made, showing how the utter intensity of internship and residency affects the lives of many different kinds of people. We watched many interviews with the students who were dazed with lack of sleep, divorce, and work weeks exceeding 100 hrs. Anyone interested in medical school should watch this for an indication of the challenges you will face."
5,Sobering & Inspiring,EXCELLENT! This documentary is an incredible view of the real-life sacrifices some people make as they enter the fascinating world of medicine. Anyone considering a career in medicine should see this documentary.
5,Jesse Davis' best album so far,"Just by listening to the intro of the first tune ""Journey To Epiphany"" (great title, too) it is clear that this is the right stuff: Hank Jones on piano, Lewis Nash on drums, the flowing bass lines of giant Ron Carter and the young trumpet virtuoso Nicholas Payton are the ideal foil for the thoughtful compositions and the fine alto playing of Jesse Davis. All but three of the tunes are written by the altoist and they are very fine. The rhythm section could not be improved upon and the recording sound is crisp. A beautiful record overall."
4,This book has made me more conscious,"This is a book about women and the motivation and emotions that determine: our choice of employment, the men we date and how we equate money and possessions with our self worth.I do not mean to be sexist AND, for me, this book has helped me think more about major things in my life (job, partner and shopping). Women and men in America today make decisions about money and income for different reasons and I much enjoyed reading the women-only side of the isseu. For me, Liz Perle shines the light on things we do not often discuss, and I do not often think about. I also enjoyed the mix of personal and ""expert"" input.A downside, the book seemed to be written in hetero-sexist way. I don't think Ms. Perle spoke once of women who partner with women."
3,I couldn't relate,"The author constantly talks about how she and all her friends were raised to think that they would grow up to be taken care of by a man. It's very helpful to understand where the author is coming from, but my peers and I simply don't share this expectation, which made the book a little less relevant for me. I was hoping for a book that would help me understand why I handle money the way I do, and this book is, as the title states, a memoir more than anything else. I also thought that the writing could have been a little tighter; it seemed like the author kept repeating the same points over and over."
4,excellent wake up call,"liz perle's memoir is a memoir many women could have written, in that a lot of us have that story. i appreciated her willingness to take money, long a dirty and avoided topic, out of the shadows where it usually hides and actually take a serious look about what is happening. despite advances in hiring and women's increased opportunity in the work world, it is clear that in many cases we are not fighting for the same equality in money management. and shame on us for not paying attention. while i haven't been through a faild marriage and lived to tell as perle has, her warnings about what can result from negligence or the ""handing over"" of your financial control to anyone else and remaining in ignorance are scary, and should be required reading for all women who claim they can't be bothered to balance checkbooks."
4,"""That which is most personal is most universal""","Honest books have helped me with everything from marriage to food, and I was itching for one about money. Here it is! The only parts I skimmed were a few of the story anecdotes (felt like filler) and many of the study statistics, which seemed like negative motivation (doomsday perspectives never inspire me). My favorite part was the beginning, where the most soul-baring takes place; it helped me venture into my own depths. Truth sets you free, whether it's someone else's or your own, and there is freedom here for all of us."
4,Helpful,I did find this book helpful in that it helps ground me back from wanting things that are really wants and not needs. I did find myself wishing Perle had disclosed more specific details about her ups and downs with salary over the years. It would have felt more like a memoir if that had been the case.
2,Not Even Worth Borrowing From the Library,"Thankfully I got this book in the Bargain Books but even the amount I paid seems too much. This book wasn't really a memoir nor would I call it a self-help book b/c it wasn't really offering any advice. It had a lot of interesting tidbits of information, a few comments about the authors life and that was it. There's no point of this book. Some of the tidbits/facts were interesting but I was left with the feeling of ""ok...and how can we deal with this problem?"" It was like a page in a magazine with a bunch of random facts from various money books. Not worth the money or time!"
1,Not worth the money at all...,"I bought the blender/food processor combo because I prepare baby food at home (which needs to have a smooth consistency)and chop veggies up at lot. It turns out that neither the blender nor the processor has blades that are sharp enough to finely grind, let alone ""liquefy"" food. The food comes out with unprocessed chunks and uneven consistency. When it comes to baby food, it's an accident waiting to happen, since the chunks left behind are a choking hazard. I very much REGRETED buying this product. Not to mention how LOUD it is!! You can't carry out a conversation across the room if you have it on! Save your money and buy a piece of equipment that's a step up from this garbage."
3,Good one for price.,"Grinder is nice but the speeds don't vary much. Just consider this one as having a high and a low speed. I have found no difference in speeds when choosing different options in hi and lo. The food processor is handy but don't expect much from it. Overall it is a nice one, gets the job done."
5,A wonder in the kitchen,"My mother always used Hamilton Beach products and I remember watching her use her blender which lasted many years, I continue to use these products. The Hamilton Beach Blender/Food Processor is easy to use, handy,convenient and durable."
2,Failed ice test,"My wife wanted a blender / food processor and was looking at this one as possibility. She read the reviews--good and bad--and decided to try it out for herself. Her other interest was the Cuisinart PowerBlend Duet. We bought both and put them to an ice test: how quickly and thoroughly would each crush six ice cubes with the out-of-the box blades?The Cuisinart was first. Other than being a little loud (which we had expected from comments we read), it performed beautifully; the blender ground the ice down within a quick 3 seconds. Happy, we prepped the Hamilton Beach for the same task. Our results were far different, though. After 4 attempts at the same cubes, the Hamilton Beach failed to grind them down. After a certain point, the still large chunks only rattled around in the carafe.The failure did make our decision much easier. If it can't perform that well right off the shelf, we can't really expect it to do better down the road. Cuisinart it was!"
1,"Cheap, breaks easily -- don't buy!",I've barely had this 6 months and have only used it maybe 10 times and it's already broken. Not to mention it didn't work well when it was functioning. I bought this to make smoothies and I constantly had to stir the fruit up because it wouldn't mix well.
4,"I like the weight, performance, and easy care of the blender","This has been my replacement for a blender combo whose glass jar I broke. Like the title says, I'm very happy with the blender aspect. So far I've pureed soups and blended smoothies with it. Like other combos, however, the food processor can't handle much. I tried to chop two small red bliss potatoes I had quartered and it was a waste of time. Wetter food like onions and tomatoes have been easier."
4,It does the job,"I've enjoyed my blender and processor. I like the wave action of the blender, and the fact that the jar is made of plastic and not glass. The blender we bought right before this one, and returned within a couple weeks, broke when the ice hit the side. My blender before that fell off the sink and shattered, so I was tired of the glass. The only complaint is the really loud and sometimes ear piecing sound it makes when trying to blend ice and frozen fruit. Otherwise, it has been great. The processor has been good. I try to blend nuts to powder and it does a fairly decent job. It leaves a lot of bigger chunks, I just have to live with that our strain them out. The processor does NOT come with the shredding attachment that most processors come with, it only comes with the S-blade. The product was not expensive and has done what I needed, so I'm happy with it."
3,There are better,"There are better blenders than this. The food processor is only good for chop grate, and that only after you chop up the food yourself. Most of the buttons don't work and I have had this for almost 8 months. A little disappointing, but it does the job for smoothies and protien shakes which I make daily."
3,You get what you pay for!,"This blender/processor isn't meant for big jobs, but it does the little ones very well. Easy to clean and easy to use. I'd recommend it!"
4,Wonderfully Easy!,"This blender/food processor is the perfect addition to any kitchen. It chops, grates, and purees. Wonderful for any cooking project, big or small. We do major parties with a lot of people, so this is the greatest contraption for quick chopping projects! Very high quality."
1,Not worth it.,Terrible. Made very cheap. I was very excited when I bought this thinking that is was going to be great. I burned out the motor first time using it.Don't waste your money
1,ZZZZZZZ......Oh - Is it over?,"We loved the ""Over California"" Video and wanted to see the beauty of Idaho from an aerial view as well. This one was much slower, the video quality was not as good and it was very shakey (made my wife motion sick.There are a few nice scenery clips - Fast Forward works well for this."
2,Ultimately not very uplifting.,"When my church group began studying the fruit of the Spirit, I picked up this book as a supplemental resource. To be honest, I didn't find it particularly helpful.While I have no problem with the book's general message, I found it to be rather superficial. There's nothing here that was really helpful or inspiring. The writing is stilted and jerky and often goes off on tangents. While I appreciate Meyer's willingness to share her personal experiences, I would have preferred fewer anecdotes and more Scriptural references and examples."
1,You Have To Search for the Message,"I opened this book eagerly and leave it with disappointment. I applaud the ideas and concepts of the book but poor grammar and writing style get in the way of the message. I strongly hope that Ms. Meyers will find someone with a ""gift"" for writing to assist her in sharing her message, which is valuable."
5,The most helpful relationship book you can buy. Really.,"Three months into every relationship I've ever had, theperson I was dating would freak out, demand space, insiston seeing other people, or tell me he wasn't ready to getserious. Before reading this book, I thought I was choosingthe wrong people. Now, thanks to _A Fine Romance_, I know it'snothing personal -- it's just a phase. Thisis the single most helpful book about relationships I'veever read, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it'sdramatically improved the quality of my love life. I've beenknown to call it my ""secret weapon."" Forewarned is forearmed!"
5,A Rare Find,I dont often give out five stars but this one is definitely worth it. It gives good analysis of why relationships fail or succeed and gives a clear road map on how you can find and keep a loving relationship.I recently found a site that also has excellent material for courtships. It contains 1000 questions that couples should ask each other. questionsforcouples dot com
1,Dont waste your money,"This book has little more information than the factory manual and in fact, it has less in some areas. The author steals the exploded parts drawings from Ruger, but doesn't include a parts list.Also, it only has model information up to the 2004 models. The gun has been changed since then but the author never updated the book.Save your money."
5,Human Cytogenetics :essential data,Human Cytogenetics: essential data. Very useful. Develops from elements to important present day problems. Useful for the doctor and student
1,Only the basics,"I bought this book based on the only Amazon review. This book gave me no more information than I got from the guy at ""my local hardware store"". There is no information about patching holes, or how to remove carpet stripping and repair floors that have been covered with carpeting. This was my problem, and I am back to square one. There is also no real estimate of product needed so that you can estimate your cost. There are a few drawings and no pictures. The book looks like it was printed on an ancient home computer. There is more information about fixing floor squeeks and removing high heel shoe marks (no kidding)."
3,Es gibt Zahnlücken statt zu unterdrücken,"I bought Sprünge because I was very fascinated by its predecessor 4630 Bochum. This follow-up, however, is less catching.The opener Kinder An Die Macht (Power To The Children) is brilliant, especially the lyrics, but apart from this one, the album is close to a desert walk until the last song Angst (Fear) which becomes the second good song on the album.Grönemeyer's lyrics are always good - but on Sprünge, the accompanying music is a little too uninspired and silent."
3,A good commentary but Fitzmyer`s is better,"Raymond E. Brown called Joseph Fitzmyer ""the best learned catholic biblical scholar"". I read Collin`s commentary on the Eucharist. Well, Fitzmyer`s treatment will please much more the catholic reader and for exegetical reasons. Yes Raymond Collins has done a fine job and if you buy this commentary you`ll be happy, but if you want the best, go for Fitzmyer`s."
4,No Furniture!!!!,"I purchased this dollhouse for my daughter for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it! The problem is I cannot find the furniture for it ANYWHERE! What is going on? I paid big $ for this, and now they aren't going to make the matching furniture??? If anyone knows the answer, let me know.Disapointed Mom, Plymouth,Ma."
5,Great Christmas Gift,"My daughter received the doll house with some of the furniture from her grandmother for Christmas. She loves it. We have since collected some more of the furniture. She spends hours rearranging the furniture and playing with the dolls. I constantly hear ""Mommy come see what I've done now."" I recommend this one highly."
4,Few tips for buying this toy,"I have yet to give this to my two year old (we are saving it for Xmas) so I can't rate how much she likes it but I wanted to offer some tips. If you are getting this in advance for Xmas or a child's bday, I recommend opening the box before hand and applying all the stickers. (There really are a lot!) Also, ToysRUs just had a big buy one, get one free on all Fisher Price dollhouses and accesories (excluding Dora's dollhouse), so lots of people have put their[...] Hope that helps anyone looking for one to buy."
1,Dollhouse Furniture is NOT AVAILABLE!,I've searched high and low for the furniture for this dollhouse. After looking at the Fisher Price website tonight I see they advertise the Loving Family Twins furniture for this dollhouse! Hopefully Toys'R'Us will take the dollhouse back now!
2,Not meant to last long,"While this is a really cute set, and sized for the little ones, it really is not meant to last. After one use, parts were broken. The clubs are not very sturdy, even for my son that was very careful with them. I would not buy them again."
1,Holes are too smal,"Got this for an Xmas gift, I did not want to keep it as we have another golf set.I was overuled.The holes are too small for the balls for a young child (just shy of 3).Instead of creating different challenge levels it was different levels of frustration, frommildly annoyed to enraged. Based on the other reviews I'm sure it will bebroken and in the trash soon.The 13th thing of Christmas that is such a pain to me?"
1,Do not buy!,"I wish I could expound on the fun of these golf clubs, but my kids broke off both club heads before I was able to open the other half of the package! This toy literally didn't last two minutes before it fell apart. Upon examining the clubs there appears to be a design flaw with how the foam heads are glued to the plastic club shaft. Maybe I received a flawed set, but I'm amazed that others on here were actually able to play at all."
2,"Cute Design, Poor Quality","This product is cute, but did not last a day. We purchased it to use at my son's circus themed birthday party and within an hour of light use the foam tip of one of the clubs had broken off. This was a disappointing purchase."
3,"Good, not great","Fit is ok, didn't have the cut out for my fuel tank release located on the floor, had to cut it out myself. Quality is ok, some parts are not flat, has bubbles, not a big deal but annoying. Next time I'll get OEM, as in my other car, fit and quality are perfect, price is double but worth it."
4,Great price,It is half the price on Amazon then if bought it at the fish shop. I put it in my refugium with a cap of live sand. I don't know it is going to work but it is definitly cheaper on Amazon.
1,This movie would have worked best had the director used,the original music score that Jerry Goldsmith wrote for it (just released by Intrada). This album is nothing more than a collection of songs that calls attention to itself by its familiarity. Nothing wrong with that but this kind of film needed an original score.
4,"buy the ""Midnight Movie Collection"" Instead.","Movie 2. 'Last of The Living'-Pretty good Movie! First off, this is a ZOMEDY not a serious movie. There are some good kills and effects, and some funny lines. The story is entertaining and keeps your attention. This is easily the BEST FILM IN THIS SET. This is a Post-Apocalyptic Zombie movie, where the outbreak has already taken over and it is not just starting to spread, which is my favorite type of zombie movie because there is no time wasted on set-up and there are millions of monsters to kill! Overall 4.5 out of 5 stars. 87 min. / color/ widescreen (again nearly full screen) / Not rated / Great quality picture /Gorilla PicturesP.S. ""The Frank Woo"" = Best post-mordem band ever LOL.Bought on""Midnight Movie Collection"" , a pack of 4 zombie movies for the price of less than one."
2,Love Chabrol but...,"These DVDs were transfered and distributed by a low-rent production house in LA and seem like a total rush job. The subtitles are poorly translated and the video is sloppy. Maybe one day, these masterworks will fall into more professional and capable hands. Til then, rent don't buy."
5,A must have for mothers,I love this CD! Clooney loves her girls you can tell. I recommend this as a gift for any mother expecting a girl or for any Clooney fan.
5,Rosemary Clooney: Mothers & Daughters CD,The CD was in perfect condition when I received it. It's a very sentimental piece; a definite must for any real Rosemary Clooney fan. Highly recommend it. The seller was great!!!
1,"This cd was a big turn off, it could have had better results","This cd seemed doomed from the very beginning. Let me try to explain. For starters, it used a lot of electronic instrumentation. I would have preferred acoustic instrumentation. Next it used a very weak repertoire that I didn't know very well. Oh, I knew a few of the songs, but nearly enough of the songs performed.For the bright spots, I thought Rosie sang well. Her pianist John Oddo did do some great arranging on some of the songs. Her band also gave some good performances on some of the songs. All and all, I was disappointed in this project. I felt like it should have and could have been better.Recommendation: I Can Not Recommend This CD"
3,One major issue,"This book was reasonably priced and appears to be of good physical quality. However it has, for me, one major issue which puts it at the bottom of my pile of books for learning the Russian language. The problem is instead of the Russian text being in written Cyrillic it is all transliterated. Anyone serious about learning Russian has to learn Cyrillic or they will not be able to read any Russian websites or absolutely anything encountered in Russia. I suspect it may suit someone starting out who wishes to learn grammar before the alphabet in which case it may be an excellent book, but to my mind that is learning things backwards and will slow the overall learning process! Sorry Nina :-( If you produce a Cyrillic version I will buy it..."
1,Everything But the Alphabet,"I hate to hammer the same nail as everybody else but you gotta learn the Cyrillic alphabet if you want to learn Russian. I thought it would be a good way to brush up on my college Russian. I can say, ""I'm going to town"" when I see it in Cyrillic but if a beginner tried to read it in the English alphabet as it's written in this book he or she would have difficulty. If that person ever did venture to Russia he or she would be unable to read the restroom or metro signs. I can't imagine how someone with no knowledge of Russian could even begin to utilize this book. It's hard to use even if you know some Russian. I guess publishers hope to profit by selling a copy to most libraries in America. Without the Cyrillic alphabet there's nothing to build on."
1,How to be illiterate in Russian,"I have NO idea what would possess a publisher to put out a Russian text without anything in Cyrillic! It's a mind-boggling error that would leave one totally unable to read anything in Russian, and what's the point of learning to be illiterate in a foreign language? Luckily for me, I found this book in a store and had a chance to look at it before buying...as soon as I realized the transliterations weren't simply aids to pronunciation, I put it back on the shelf. It's such a great idea, to have a book of practice exercises, but if all your other materials are in Cyrillic, you need to practice writing it. I hope the publisher re-thinks this, and does it correctly next time--it would be so useful to have."
1,Get the similar edition: Everything Learning Russian,"Agreeing with previous reviews of this book-CD, I found the transliteration of Russian very awkward. I happened to look at a similar edition of this series in a bookstore, and noticed that it was not only in Cyrillic, but the Cyrillic uses bold type to indicate stress.The Everything Learning Russian: Speak, Write, and Understand Russian in No Time (Everything: Language and Literature). This is the text to buy if you really want to learn some Russian."
1,Why the transliteration?,"There are so many different systems of transliteration in use in Russian, that unless the reader is familiar with and comfortable with the system used by the author, this book is going to be awkward to use. And besides, anyone who's going to learn Russian should begin with the Cyrillic alphabet anyway. I don't get the purpose of writing the book in transliterated Russian. I found it annoying, because it adds an extra layer of thought to the study process. You have to sound out the transliterated word, visualize it in Cyrillic, and then remember what it means, and then work out the grammar issues. This book is not for students of Russian. I'd suggest that the publisher go back, put the Cyrillic back in and then republish. You can even leave the transliteration in place, it does have some usefulness, after all. But stay away from this if you are accustomed to working in Cyrillic."
4,Great for skates,"I got this bag as a gift. I needed something for all of my roller derby gear and this seemed perfect. I just got it and so far I am really impressed. It is well made and all of my gear fits inside (although it could be a little bit wider for my skates) including skates, knee pads, elbow pads, wrist guards, helmet and all of the knick knacks I carry with me like spare laces, a towel, Band-Aids etc. My only complaint is that I received the orange bag and it isn't as orange as I expected. Closer to a yellow. That is the only thing and I think I will just cover it with patches."
4,Missing her shoes!,"I do like the way this Miss Clavel looks, but she arrived yesterday with no shoes!! So promptly back to Amazon she will go...As far as the doll, I like the modern faces of this series much better, but I must admit I somewhat prefer the older style Miss Clavel's, dressed as a nun (though all the other dolls from the series I like much much better in the modern look). I bought the old style Miss Clavel too, and will refer to her as Miss Clavel and will probably give this doll a pretend teacher's name for my daughter. When she saw this doll, she thought she was Mary Poppins. So maybe that will be her name. I wish they had given this doll the nun's outfit so she'd have the best of both worlds, nice face and nun outfit."
4,Great personal enrichment book,"I purchased this book a long time ago and was happy to find it again in Amazon's used books. Price was high for condition of the book, but still worth buying for a gift."
2,Not the best,"I was looking for a fun phone for my baby. The phone is to quite. You can barely hear it. Plus it's fabric on the front, which I don't really like because you can sterilize it."
4,Glad Grandma has it,"Would I pay $25 for this? No. And I doubt my mom paid that much (maybe $10 to $12). But as my title says, I'm glad my mom has it at her house.Fun: My son grips this really well and totes it around with him at Grandma's house. The little antenna thing was always in his mouth. Perfect teether.Educational Value: It lights up and sings songs; not much to learn there. It's ""smartest"" use is simply that it's a toy kids can mimic adult behaviors with.Durable: I have no idea how long my mom has had hers (oldest grandchild is 7) but it looks like it's been around for a while, and still works great.If I were to stumble across this at a garage sale or thrift store I'd buy it, or if it was on a great sale. My 10-month old really enjoyed it, but it isn't such a must have that I'll spend much on it. If you do buy it, you'll quickly get used to ""hi baby"" ""bye baby"", but the sound is pretty soft so it's not annoying."
2,Not what I expected!,"This phone is soft alright - the ""music"" is sooooo soft that it's barely audible. Not what I had hoped for from Vtech."
1,Unsanitary,"Glad I only paid $6 for this. More than that and I would have paid the shipping to return it. It's supposed to be for 3m+. The box says it's ""infant-sized"" but it's about the same size as a 1980s cell phone. The real problem though is that it's partly covered in cloth which can only be surface-cleaned. My 6-month-old drools all over everything then puts it in his mouth and chews on it. Since you can't exactly run this thing through the wash the fabric would be covered in disgusting unwashable slime in a matter of days with no way to sanitize it. No way I want him chewing on that after a few days. I guess I can keep it out of his reach and play a song for him, but there's no way I'm going to let him play with it. Maybe it would be great without the cloth."
1,Bad Amazon order-Klutz,I ordered the Klutz Nail Art from Amazon. I was very disappointed when 2 of the nail polishes were dried SOLID with the brush broken and the rest were very dry and a horrible consistency. Just get this at Barnes and Nobles. Not worth the disappointment.
2,nail art book,"the book was great,but the nail polish peels off after it dries,could have been better polish,the colors where not as bright as shown in the ad"
5,nail art,"I really liked this item and my kids do too, the book has many great ideas and very easy to work with. The cost of the book is well in the pricing range and recommend to anyone else to buy."
2,not so good,"i purchased this book for my cousin who is 7 years old. She looked at it and thought it was cool. When she opened it she found the instruction booklet missing. Also when she painted her fingernails, the nail polish was peel- off, and came off within a few hours. This product is un-satisfatory, and i suggest you don't purchase it."
3,Paints peel off easy!,"It was fine as an activity for the party which is what I bought it for. But the paints do peel off very easily. You may want to add a coat of clear nail polish after all the trouble you go through to put all those designs. Also, you may need to use tooth pick to get most of those designs given in the book, there is nothing that comes with the kit to make the designs given in the book."
3,Okay for younger girls.,"I purchased the product for my ten year old daughter. I thought that it would have a more thorough discussion on nail preparation than it did. I also thought that the nail polish would stay on longer than a day, it didn't. Even the amount of designs were very limited. I guess I am comparing to a nail book I saw once and haven't been able to replace. This book is very lacking in comparison even though the other one was a young adult book as well. Any way, if you have very young children who doesn't care about how long the polish stays on or how good it REALLY looks then this book and paints are okay otherwise steer clear."
3,yay?,"this book was fun, but some of the designs are hard to do. it takes a long time for me to do it. and when i was done the first time, it peeled right off! but i guess that can be a good OR bad thing. so the second time around..i put clear nail polish on it. it worked fine."
2,Terribly over-priced,"While the book itself is a nice guide on creating nail art, the polish that comes with it peels off entirely too easily, so all of the nail art you have painstakingly created comes off before the hour is up - unless you are doing nothing but sitting in a chair with your hands flat on the table for that hour.Either the caliber of nail polish needs to be changed or the price needs to come WAY down for this to be anything short of a rip-off.My daughter and I bought some Wet and Wild polish and will try again. Too bad we couldn't get that money reimbursed from the price of this book."
1,Nail Polish completely peeled off within an hour - such a disappointing gift!,"My four year old daughter was so excited to try this and was heartbroken after we did her nails one afternoon (I even put one of my own top coats on to seal in the design), and after an hour every single nail peeled off completely. The ideas in the book are cute but not worth the money...to execute them I'll now have to go spend $50 on all the different color polishes. Complete waste of money - I'd return it if I could. Don't waste your $$!"
5,simple and surprising!!!,"When my daughter saw this book on the shelf on the kid's section, her eyes actually shone!!! She always comes with me to the manicure, so she got very exited with the idea of also being able to do her nails in a fun way, that is why I think this book is suitable for all ages, because it is nice to hear the compliments that the people say about your flowers, bunnies or bees on your nails!"
5,Love it,My niece had these and I had to get some for my kids as they were so easy to use and the designs so cute. Definitely recommend.
5,great creative book,this is a book all girls can enjoy got it for grandkids they love it. Great mom and me book
5,a blast from the past,Super cute set that I used as a kid. It came well packaged and is as cute as ever. I bought this for my mom's co-worker and her and her daughter are thrilled to start making new memories with this book!
4,Nail Painting Kit,"The book has lots of cute ideas that my girls love. My only complaint is that they paint is not real durable, and rubs off very quickly. My girls love picking our the holiday designs for their nails. Great gift idea!"
4,Good gift!,My niece loved it as this was part of her Christmas gift. I would recommend it just for the ideas in the book.
2,Doesn't work too well,"Nail Art is a great idea and the book has many cute and creative nail projects. However, we have found that it is very hard to duplicate the designs in the book. My daughter, age 10, can't do it herself. I also have a hard time. Then, when you finally get something you like, the polish peels right off. Peel-off polish is a fantastic concept, but it would be better if it at least lasted a few hours. We love the concept, but I rated it a 2 because it really isn't usable. It's also expensive, so I feel it is a waste of your money."
4,Creative ideas,"My 11 year old daughter wanted this and has had a great time trying out the many different ideas for nail designs. I couldn't be happier about the book. The nail polish, however, peels off too easily. It comes off in the shower, or just under very normal playing conditions. As a previous reviewer said, this can be an advantage or disadvantage. No struggling with the nail polish remover to get something off. It's just frustrating when she's worked so hard to come up with something pretty and it falls off before she's had a chance to enjoy it. Plan to buy some other nail polish to use with this fantastic book if you want the designs to last."
5,how fun! creative nail art for kids,my girls have given this nail art book as a birthday gift twice now and are really really hoping it will be their turn soon : ) the illustrations/photos are great and look like they are simple enough to follow that they can do themselves... well maybe not yet. the designs probably would be better executed by a pre-teen/teenager.
4,Great fun for all ages,I bought this for my 5 year old grand-daughter and we have had a great deal of fun with it. We can practice the many designs and the polish peels off easily. The only problem is that it peels sometimes too easily. We bought real polish and use the designs in the book for ideas. Worth the money.
4,Fun Pedicure Night!!,"I gave this as a gift to my 9-yr-old neighbor. She immediately got to work on my daughters nails and her own. Each limb with a different theme. Very cute. Suggest going over the finished nails with a clear coat as the polish washed off or peeled within two days, but that is with pretty much all novelty polish. I would still recommend this for a fun pedicure night!!"
4,A summary of the Civil War in Spain.,"I have read a number of books about the Civil War in Spain. This is by far the most even handed when it describes the atrocities performed by both the Loyalists and Nationalists. For contemporary writers, it is easy to lambast Franco and his Nationalists for the evils they performed and overlook what the Communists and Anarchists performed on the upper classes and Church. Goldston does not do this. He describes both evils and was fair to both sides.This book has both illustrations and pictures and was an easy read of 130 pages. If the reader is looking for more detail, read elsewhere."
5,A must read for any person caring 4 human-equine communicati,"I consider this book is wonderful for the person who loves horses and tries to understand them. Puts together millions of little details that we notice every day in our horses and which we understand, revealing all those horse attitudes the experienced horse person has learned to recognize and interpret. There is a lot of useful information on how to deal reasonably with different kinds of horses and how to distinguish them. It is very valuable for any person working to achieve a better human-equine communication. It has reached the top shelf in my ""horse library""."
1,Get Robert Vavra's book instead,"If you want to learn about the nuances of horse body language and behaviour Robert Vavra's ""Such Is the Real Nature of Horses"" will tell you much more than this book."
5,Wow,"A really smart riff on Noir. Beautiful to look at, magical and deep, I really liked this movie and was so absorbed that I didn't spot the drag queen until the second time around. Adjani is incredibly touching and Depardieu treads the fine line between menace and vulnerability like a master. Boy, don't miss this one."
2,Expected more,"I love Gerard Depardieu and this is the only reason I bought this DVD. I also know the flavor of these types of film by him is somewhat different. Gerard is the best at period pieces which I own. You cannot get better than Depardieu, but the story line is so different I am not totally crazy about this one. It is just me and the type of film it is."
2,"ANDRE TECHINE, OPUS 3","** 1976. Co-written and directed by André Téchiné. Three French César awards (nine nominations) in 1977. Cold and affected, BAROCCO is not the André Téchiné movie you should see first if you want to discover this director. You should rather try some of his more recent efforts likeMy Favorite SeasonorStrayed, movies which emit real feelings and are not as artificial asBaroccoor THE BRONTE SISTERS shot right afterwards."
3,Idiotic,"Idiotic plot, poorly directed, ridiculous dialog, and atrocious, inept acting. Was hoping for a bleak French political thriller or neo-noir film, didn't get it here. The scene of a news reporter covering the meeting of a candidate and Gerard Depardieu, the washed-up boxer, was like watching painfully boring French films. Decent washed-out, gloomy neo-noir cinematography but not enough to save this from being just another 3-star movie."
1,Save your money,"In my opinion this cd is Britney meets Ace Of Base. I wish I had saved my money. She could have been a lot more original. I liked the song entitled, ""Save your kisses for me"". I was turned off however when I noticed another song with the exact same tune. I ran across Natasha Thomas on YouTube, and liked her video, ""It's over now"" a lot. However on the cd the man who was singing with her on the video was not singing on the copy of the cd that I had gotten. When I listen to this song now I can not get Ace Of Base out of my head...""All that she wants is... Anyway, it is sick how close that tune is to the Ace Of Base song. :( It has become a cd that sits in my never played pile. Unless you are sure you are a huge fan of hers, my suggestion would be save your money!"
1,Slightly less mature than back issues of Tiger Beat,"Apparently Delta's extensive experience has not included a chapter about how one does not refer to one's self as ""a goddess."" Though her fans may find the photo album and ""pity me"" tales of interest - and those into untrue but popular psychology will love the absurd stereotype about how heavy women were victims of molestation - there is nothing of value here. Her strange fashion advice would appeal only to those with the taste for the flamboyant."
5,Be yourself,I loved the book. I have always been heavy. I tried to lose weight for someone else not myself. At one time I did lose 50 pounds but I have put it back on and then some. Delta taught me to be myself and love myself for whom I am not how much I weigh. Her beauty tips were great also. I usually don't were make-up because I really don't now how to apply it. But Delta showed me how to be beautiful on the inside as well as on the outside. I have been wearing make-up and now I feel pretty. Thanks for always being there for the big girls.
4,Nice loud sound.,"A friend of mine has this, and I liked the sound so I purchased one for myself. The horn is a nice and loud deep sound, not too tinny. I mounted the trumpets in my bumper (2001 Xterra w/aftermarket bumper) and it still sounds nice.As stated previously, the tubing leaves a little to be desired, but in the past 6 months it has worked w/o any problems. If it cracks I'll replace it, if not it's there to stay.I didn't use the included button or wiring, so I can't comment on them, but they looked like they would function just fine.The added port on the compressor, and additional spiral tubing and fittings are nice for airing up tires in a pinch."
4,Nice sound.,"I have this mounted under my bumper on my 88 tempo, I'll probably get into some trouble with this bad boy.:D"
2,"Carol is that great singer, we have been looking for",Carol Sloane really knows how to sing JAZZ. She seems to be a natural at this venue. Her voice is really smooth and nice to listen to.For this project Carol used Bill Charlap as pianist and arranger. I must say Bill did a good job wearing both hats. Also Carol has a lot of fine sidemen that contributed to this cd. I think we need to give the musicians for this project a hand of applause.The down side to this cd was that some of the arrangements I didn't like and feel that they worked very well. All and all I would say this was a worth while cd.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd.
5,The Gingerbread Man in Signed English,"This is a simple, and concise version of the age old charming story of The Gingerbread Man. The illustrations are colorful and charming. What really sets it apart is the clearly illustrated signs. My pre-kindergarten class of three and four year old children enjoyed signing words in the story such as the gingerbread man and the assortment of animals. This was a catalyst for learning to sign the first letters in their names. The Gingerbread Man in Signed English really developed an interest in sign language and communication without words for my pre-kindergarten students.I highly recommend this picture book as an added adition to your library for preschoolers and young children."
2,Why are they screaming at each other?,"I love her previous books. Truly, I could not wait until this book came out and now I wish I had. I counted 28 !!!! on one page alone. Everytime anyone would talk, the sentence would end with an exclamation point. It was incredibly annoying.""I'll go wash my face!""""Right!""""Get me a drink!""UGH.I keep hearing their voices in my head and it seemed that they were screaming at each other. I do love her other books and this one was written so poorly I often wondered if someone else hadn't written it.Not recommended."
1,Dottie meets a deadline--barely,"Having vacationed in the South Carolina low country for over 30 years,I have read all of Ms. Frank's books with great interest. I thought Sullivan's Island was one of the best books I have read in years and have eagerly awaited each of her subsequent deliveries. Shem Creek is the most poorly done of all the books. It seems hurriedly cranked out, as though she forgot she had a deadline. There is poor character and plot development, dialog is trite, and the ending is packaged up too neatly to be believed. Isle of Palms has a story line very similar to Shem Creek, but is somewhat better developed. It would be nice to see Ms. Frank write a book where the primary female character isn't divorced, broke, fighting with her daughter, and ultimately rescued by a wealthy ex-husband or some rich new comer. Borrow this book-don't buy it."
4,Love it for the easy read...,"It flows well, and it allows the reader to hear the sounds, smell the smells, and taste the food. It's a great, easy read, and anyone looking for something *dynamic* and *provoking* as with some of the complaints on this review panel, are in the wrong place. Never does it seems as though Ms. Frank is trying to pull off anything other than entertainment. It was lovely! I loved the characters, and I love the 'second chance' idea..."
1,SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!,I loved Plantation and Sullivan's Island but I could hardly finish this book. This was not up to her usual writing. I agree with the other reviewer I had to keep going back to reread parts. Bottom line for me this book was boring boring boring. So disappointed in this one. Trying to decide if I want to try Pawley's Island.
4,Shem Creek,As always Dorothy Benton Frank pulls us into the life of her characters. I have taken one of her books to the beach with me for the past four summers and always anticipate a great read. My favorite aspect about Mrs. Franks writing is how she can pull characters from past books into her new ones. It's like seeing an old friend again. Shem Creek won't disappoint!
3,Just ok,"This is the first book from this author I have read and like somebody else said if these reviews didn't say this was not her best work I would never read another. I did laugh aloud at some stuff (mostly louise I think everybody knows somebody like her) and she has a different writing style. It wasn't very realistic, the plot was practically non-existant and the ending left you feeling like what the heck was that all about? The whole think with the old man...was that really necessary, it was just silly. Very predictable but to tell you the truth when I bought it I wasn't looking for anything to deep and thought invoking."
4,Very entertaining,I really like this book. I was written well. Held my interest from page the first page.
5,Hard to put down.,"I started to read this book in 2006 and found, as a Yankee, the flow was difficult to follow. I read Sullivan's Island one week ago while on vacation and fell in love with Ms. Frank's flow, ease and voice. Finishing Sullivan's Island was difficult b/c I of the time I enjoyed being in Charleston and Sullivan's Island with Susan, Maggie and their family/history. However, I immediately picked up Shem Creek and instantly fell into the, now familiar, rhythm and flow of Ms. Frank's voice. She has a wonderful and easy way of lulling one into her family to the point you do not want to leave. I am now halfway through Shem Creek and find it very hard to put down. Thankfully I am still on vacation and will not have to abandon Shem Creek for another day or two. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the inclusion of characters from Sullivan's Island and Isle of Palms who have visited Shem Creek."
3,Misses the mark,"Although I enjoyed Pawley's Island, I found that Shem Creek was not in the same category. It was disjointed and unfocused. I couldn't identify with the characters who went from one tragedy to another. The book just did not have the flow of Dot Frank's other books. There also seemed to be several unresolved issues and a continuing chain of lucky coincidences. Not very believable, in my opinion. The book is still entertaining and some readers may enjoy it, but I believe that Ms. Frank's other books have more merit."
2,"Love Benton Frank, but this one's just not up to par","DBF once again uses the plot device of returning home to reclaim yourself and your life. That part of the story was good, but other parts of it suffered. She wrote strange dialog for her teen daugter (no high school girl talks like that) and the ""romance"" was rushed and pulled out at the finish line in a very few pages. I was never convinced it was Linda that Brad loved or just the idea of being in a loving family. DBF's a great writer and I look forward to other works from her, but this one just didn't measure up."
5,"a brilliant story of friendship, love and making fresh starts!","With her trademark casual and conversational style of writing, Dorothea Benton Frank has the magical knack of pulling the reader directly into the setting, making it feel as though the characters are friends and neighbors, and the low country of South Carolina is home. I have a particular fondness for stories that are centered around a restaurant, and the Italian flare added a special touch. As someone in a similar stage of life as Linda, I held a special appreciation for her plight, especially in her relationships with her daughters, which was very realistically portrayed when compared to the interactions of my daughters with myself and with each other. I don't understand the negative comments in other reviews, as I loved this book and thought it provided wonderful and heartwarming reading!"
2,keeps getting worse,"I loved SULLIVAN'S ISLAND, liked PLANTATION, ISLE OF PALM was ok,but SHEM CREEK is simply a poor book. Linda Breland divorcedmother of 2 moves her family to her hometown Shem Creek. Thestory goes down hill from there, she moves in with her sister, finds a job, falls in love. The plot was mainly boring and and the characters struck me a being false. Maybe there are people who talk that way but I don't know them. In anycase save your money and wait for the paperback."
3,Not up to par with others.....,"The low country of South Carolina is my second home, so I love to read books that take place there. I have enjoyed all four of Benton Frank's books, but found this one lacking. While enjoyable, Shem Creek was not as rich or complex as the other three books, and lacked the more intricate character development and low country feeling contained in her other works. The resurfacing in minor roles of major characters from prior books is interesting and fun, but I find it annoying that I cannot quite remember just who they were. Some sort of key to characters would be helpful in forthcoming books."
3,A good read but not her best,"I anxiously awaited the release of Shem Creek after spending the last week of July reading Isle of Palms. I was hoping to continue the warm Southern family atmosphere into the last days of summer but I have to say I was disappointed. Shem Creek feels like it was put together in a hurry and reads like it. I had trouble keeping characters straight in the first few chapters; we don't really get an introduction to each character until about halfway through the book and by that time, they can't grow on you.The inclusion of characters from Isle of Palms was familiar, but they didn't lend anything to the theme. None of Shem Creek's players are as intriguing or relatable as Frank's previous novels, which makes her a favorite author, and I miss that.Good summer read, Dot, but please take your time with your next book!"
3,Not as good as most of Frank's other works,"While this book is set in the lowcountry of South Carolina (the main reason I read Dorothea Benton Frank's books--because I love the islands off SC) I am not enjoying it as much as her other books. Don't get me wrong -- it's an ok book, but I much preferred Porch Lights, Sullivan's Island, etc. I like to fall in love with her characters but in this book it's not happening for me."
3,Low Country Tabloid,"Dorthea Benton Frank's SHEM CREEK takes the reader deep into the SC Low Country. The story is sweet and well written, but generally lacking in depth. Each character performs a given role within a contrived frame.The landscape for me was a much stronger character. Very light reading for a hot, and humid summer day.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
2,Shem Creek,"I have read other books by Dorothea Benton Frank. I think I liked them. This one is a big disappointment.There came a scene when she meets a scientist who is dressed in fatigues, or some such. He turns out to be a ""tree hugger"" because he objects to pig manure filling the river.That was the point when I decided this author is letting the values of the real modern south seep through the romanticized south she usually writes about.I felt this author has disdain for anyone who does not want tons of pig manure washing into our rivers. She seemed like a tea bagger.More substantively, the story does not work. The whole setting of the restaurant and it being the center of the lives of the adult characters, does not feel like a restaurant. It feels like a gossip scene where people talk trash, talk gossip, talk feelings, talk nothing. There is no real sense of food, why one should love food or pay for it, in this story.It feels like a waste of my time."
3,Unmemorable,"Couldn't even remember enough about this book to review it in my personal notes that I keep on each book I read. In fact I had forgotten I had even read it, since I didn't review it right away, until a month or so later. Had to look at these reviews to remember what the story was. However, it was an easy and mildly entertaining book while I was reading it."
4,Delightful!,"Shem Creek delivers a delightful reading experience about Linda, a divorcee living in NJ, and her two daughters Lindsay and Gracie as the relocate to Linda's childhood town. Humor abounds throughout the story as the family encounters the good times and difficulties in their new community. The characters are lovable, even the ones you love to hate. The good and bad of the book is it's an extremely enjoyable story and moves quickly (the good), and (the bad) sometimes characters or actions occur too quickly (we never really learn much about Alex, when Brad truly falls in love it's rather sudden in the text). These are minor flaws compared to the wonderful experience reading another great Frank book. I will admit Isle of Palms still remains my favorite and the appearance of some of those characters in Shem Creek was fun. I look forward to reading Pawley's Island. Highly recommended, and would be especially enjoyable as a summer vacation read."
1,Horrible,I bought this book on a whim as I needed an airplane book. It was one of the worst things I've read. Not one word of dialogue rang true and I was embarrassed to be reading it.
3,"Location, location, location","That about sums it up. I was sooooo looking forward to this one coming out. The cover is beautiful and beckons with such promise. South Carolina - what could be better? Unfortunately, this was probably one of Dottie's most boring novels."
1,disappointing,I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book. This is one I won't pass on to or recommend to anyone. The messy dialogue itself is a reason to skip this one.
4,Getting what you deserve...,"This book is about being happy. What ever your current situation might be, you can always change it. It might not be easy but it can always be different. A good lifes lesson for people who complain alot!I loved meeting the different characters (this is my first book by this author). I found each one so different it was funny to see them all in one place. And get along so well. Except for Amy that is!I'd say this is very predictable, but like most stories that are similar to this I can expect that. I wasn't dissappointed by this because I could read into it. I do generally like a curve ball thrown in but this was what I expected and very enjoyable. There was enough going on in this I didn't get bored. Although, I've noticed some of the reviewers think this is not as good as other books she has wrote. So, that makes me even happier to go read Dorothea Benton Frank's other books."
4,Superb Maritime History,"Hats off to Samuel Bawlf (gotta love the name) for this riveting account of the life and exploits of explorer cum pirate Sir Francis Drake. Bawlf concentrates on the voyage that made Drake world famous (and the secrets about the trip that Queen Elizabeth suppressed), but does a marvelous job of providing an overview of the political and economic climate in which that voyage was made. And save for a slight drag about three-quarters of the way through, Bawlf keeps the pace fast and full of suspense, without once sacrificing intelligence and clarity. For anyone interested in world history and the extraordinary men and women who made it, this is a wonderful, highly entertaining read."
5,"""-"" - Grnemeyer's best CD next to ""Bochum""","""Ö"" is truly one of the best expressions of Grönemeyer's music style and one of the great accomplishments of contemporary German pop music. With ballads like ""Komet"" and ""Halt Mich"" and quasi-rock tunes like ""Was Soll Das"" the CD is balanced, interesting and pure joy in the lyrical sense. However, even though it is suggested that one has knowledge of the German language, the music is enjoyable without understanding the words. Whether one wishes to supplement his/her world music library or get in touch with ones German roots this album is a fabulous addition. Highly recommended."
4,Pretty solid comp.,"For the most part this album is bangin. Definetly better than Suges last compilation. Production is tight and most of the kats spittin do a decent job. Some new booties and some old skool G's and plenty of underground west koast rappers.I think all of its listenable with the exception of ""F*** Hollywood"". The song is just korny and weak. He speaks the truth but it just aint put together good. The best song by far is ""The Projects"", Keita Rock krushes this track, this dudes bangin. The Relativez bang on dat punk Daz, and Crooked I and Swoop G give memorable performances. Overall Striktly for tha gangstas"
5,The great Nestico charts played by one swinging band!,Sammy Nestico- one of America's great writers is well played here by Frank Capp's band. Frank is one of the swingingest drummers around. The highlight of the CD is Steve Wilkerson's alto work on Sammy's tune Soft As Velvet - brilliant ballad playing! Great tenor battles-Pete Christlieb & Ricky Woodard and Gerald Wiggins swinging as ever on piano!
3,Good plot....poor delivery. No flow to the book.,"As with the 1st book in the series, I found the plot to be extremely interesting and gripping. Unfortunately, the way the author delivers the story, it is difficult to follow the flow of the book. By going back and forth to different time frames, the author loses any sense of stability for the story. I often found myself wondering what the author was talking about. On several occasions, the author makes references to things that have not yet occurred within the storyline. Too much chop, not enough flow!!"
5,Great for Boba Fett fans!,"This book is very entertaining. I have read all the other books that have included bounty hunters, and this one takes the cake. I can't get enough of it, I have read it from cover to cover several times."
3,Quite boring,"The chapters on Kuat of Kuat were too boring to read so I skipped them all. Other than that, the rest of the chapters on Boba Fett were quite interesting."
3,"Star Wars -Slave Ship, book 2 of 3- (Seafire12)","This is the second book in a long drawn out series. Basicaly this book answers few questions not answered from book 1 and tries to tie everything up for a huge finale. Unfortunatley the finale is lame in book 3. The point of this whole series is plot twists. That is the only thing that keeps you into these books. Even with many twists, the series falls short."
3,"For a trip to nowhere, its a very scenic route","The most disappointing thing I found about this novel was that for all the action the reader reads involving Boba Fett, Bossk, and bounty-hunting in general, almost everything talked about has happened in the past, meaning we know how things will turn out in the end. The whole book is spent with Dengar sitting aboard the Hound's Tooth retelling the story, and only seems to serve as a transitional book between 1 and 3. The good points to the novel include further characterization of Xizor, Kuat and his family line, and while the book's finale is written in the past, the double/triple crosses make it a good read. If you read book 1, read this book, so you can enjoy book 3, which is the best of the cycle"
3,Don't use this book to introduce Star Wars novels!,"This is not the book you recommend to someone who wants to get a taste for the SW books. I'm not sure what's worse, insipid, predictable dialogue that appears to do nothing more than fill page space instead of moving the plot forward, or Jeter's repetitive, melodramatic, almost amatuerish sentence structure. Tough to screw up characters as good as Boba Fett, et al, but the author's habit of trying to substitute verbage for content really slows this book down. Fortunatel the first installment was OK and the third is acceptable."
3,"Entertaining, but...","This book is a good read and pretty entertaining. The problem I had was that with all the scheming going on, I think the author got lost in the details. For example, the story of a renegade stormtrooper was cool, but how exactly did that lead to the breakup of the Bounty Hunters Guild? All we saw was the effect it had on Fett and Bossk, which was nothing new. Or (warning, spoilers ahead) how does a simple citizen of the planet Kuat have a better spy network than the Emperor? Or finally, the convoluted logic behind the whole attempt to break up the Guild. Xizor claims that it will be good for the Empire. But we're told earlier in the trilogy that members of the Guild often accept lower payments because they're weak. Isn't this good for the Empire?So, all in all, the book keeps you reading. But the lapses in logic get a little tiring."
3,"To much talk, Not enough ACTION!!","It was an ok book, but it could have been better. Its still a good book, but because there wasn't enough action, I gave it three stars.Even if every one says its boring, you still need it to complete the trilogy."
3,An all out Explosion!,"This book surely has alot of great info. that I didnt even know. I could barely put this book down. But, some points of the title were a bit sluggish, due to the on-going battle scenes when they didnt even exist. I would rate this book below:Quality-4 Layout-3+ Idea of the story:4"
1,Worst series that I have ever read,"I love Star Wars. I collect as many of the books as I can and read them in less than 2 days. This book took me almost 2 weeks. It was so boring. None of the characters acted like themselves. Boba Fett talks way too much and is too friendly. Dengar acts like a wimp who couldn't even hold a blaster without scaring himself (that never happened, but it might as well have the way that Jeter displays his character). In Tales of the Bounty Hunters, Dengar was an Imperial assassin who was stripped of almost all emotion. Bossk was never the son of the leader of the Bounty Hunters Guild. Zuckuss is supposed to be the partner of 4-LOM, not a parttime friend of Fett that will pretend to be dead so Fett can get Bossk out of the way and get the bounty. Sorry, Jeter, but read Tales of the Bounty Hunters and watch the movies. It will really help with book 3."
1,also a loser amoung winners in the star wars vien.,"This book is pretty bad in my opinion. The author has trouble with basic syntax of the universte. His phrases are clunky, and obvious cut and paste jobs.. things like ""wait a Standard Time Part"" and other such gross substitutions... And the characterizations are pallid."
2,As fluent as a bantha in the dagoba swamps...,"I love Star Wars related books, usually it takes me 4 or 5 days to read one, but this... I read it from time to time because the plot is so boring, it keeps winding and winding without any real action or suspense. The only reason I read it is because I like the way the other bounty hunters (Bossk, Zuckuss, etc) are exploited."
2,"It's Star Wars, but there are so many that are better!","When I first saw the bounty Hunter Wars books in print I grabbed them immediately. Who doesn't love reading more about Boba Fett? However, with Slave Ship and its predecessor I am left disappointed by too many scheming characters, flowery speechs the last several pages, and not enough action. Someone else needs to write this. There is so much potential!!"
5,Great storyline!,"Geat for Star Wars fans, the intricate plot keeps you on the edge of your seat on every page!"
2,"""Shudder""",Out of respect for the serise and Fett I gave this book 2 stars. It really deserves 1. What this serise does is take better already mapped areas of the Star War universe and stings them together in a totally unconving way. For example the wounds Fett suffered and the allience with Dengar has already been discused. Why do people feel the emd to rehash it?Overall-Whole serise total waste of time(unless you like The Black Sun).
2,Too much info and way to slow,"I had high hopes for this book. I had just finished The Mandalorian Armor and was very impressed with it. About 1/3 of the way through Slave Ship I began to wonder what the author was thinking. Some of the chapters seemed to strecth from one side of the galaxy to the other and explained nothing but boring dribble to the reader. I had to set the book down several times just to rest my eyes and wonder why that chapter was even in the book. Boba Fett is what the books are supposed to be about but this book ended up being about Jeter's longwindedness. I really want to read the next in the series because Boba Fett is such a unigue character.... but after this, I think Jeter has talked me out of it."
1,Booooooooooooring,"I'm as big a Star Wars addict as they come. However, when I got to the second book in this series, I got bored out of my MIND. The chapters droned on with seemingly no end. I couldn't keep reading for more than ten minutes at a time lest I fall asleep. Unless you're a diehard Fett fan, you might want to pass this one by."
2,Streching the plot to the point where nothing happens,"I really can't say much about this book because nothing really happened. It is difficult to develop the bounty hunter characters without the help the regulars (Luke, Han, etc.). It seemed like the ending was in very close but now I'll have to buy another book to find out. I thought that the conclusion could have been fit into this book and still keep it under 400 pages. But now I'll have to buy another book where probably even more of nothing will happen."
4,Good but not like the first....,"I love the Bounty Hunters of Star Wars, When I read #1 of the Bounty Hunter Wars ""Mandalorian Armor,"" I thought it was the best book ever, so I couldn't wait for the sequal. But the sequal was still good, it's just not as. It had a few chaptors that were boring. I'd only read it if you plan to read the whole saga. I can't wait for #3 to come out on July 6, 1999, called ""Hard Merchandice."" It will be cool."
1,BORING!,"This was the most BORING Star Wars book ever written. You go into the book expecting the series to improve after the first book, but it does NOT improve, instead getting worse. In retrospect, it seems that NOTHING happened in the whole book, from listening to the Kuat guy thinking about nothing for 20(!) pages, to Xizor talking to some bug alien, to Boba Fett sitting on a ship acting as stupid as possible. The characters are so poorly portrayed that they're barely recognizable. the only upside to the book is that it actually ended."
1,Yaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!,"Well, let me begin by saying if you are looking for a great book to send you off to dreamland this is it! I have read many of the Star Wars novels and this series takes the cake for the slowest reading, most confusing, and biggest waste of money. I was looking forward to a book that gave me a background possibly on how exactly Boba Fett came to be, and who he is. Guess what? That didnt happen in this series. I was thoughly bored. I have read many novels and have found myself on a few where I couldn't put it down because I was enthrawled with the story. This series I couldn't wait to put it down. I strongly suggest if they are going to take a character that didn't play a large part of a movie and glorify him, they give a better background and up the tempo. Well, off to bed....aww too bad I can't sleep. Guess I'll have to take my nytol (AKA reread the first chapter of this series.)"
2,"well, i looked for action and found none","Ok, so the first Bounty Hunter Wars book had quite a bit of action, but it still put me to sleep, but this book, this book is an insane lack of action, if you want more action, just go make yourself a milkshake or sandwich or something. i think that this should be the worlds most powerful sleeping pill. Now if you don't want action and you want to read about Vader and Xizor fighting, and you want some sort of a braintwister, then this book is for you, but overall, i'd stick to getting it from the library, or borrowing it from a friend who had the missfortune of buying."
5,after innocence,"AfterInnocence was one of the first books I have read.I loved it! (I have re-read it at least half a dozen times since)it is my all time favorite.up there with ""GONE WITH THE WIND"".Edward De Lanza and Sophie are the ideal fantasy.I have to admit, that I fantasied about being in Edwards arms instead of Sophie(Who would'nt!}I could not put the book down,great reading,great writing by Brenda Joyce.I rate this book 5 stars and a perfect10! ""If you already havn't,read this book! YOUR THE BEST BRENDA,KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
3,"Too long, too many misspells","""After Innocence"" by Brenda Joyce. I don't like to give poor reviews, but I was disappointed with this story and am amazed that others have given it 5 stars. ""Throughout the entire story"" there were so very many misspells on my Kindle copy, I would have to stop and figure out the words. The book was too long because of too many stories and excess descriptions. It was like a saga of an entire family. That said, I really liked the beginning, loved the Hero, liked the Heroine but she made stupid decisions. One step-sister just dropped from the story. The epilog was a bit much too. I cannot recommend it. I gave it 3 stars because I liked the basic story."
1,TYPOS. OH GOD THE EFFING TYPOS,"First of all, I love Brenda Joyce novels in all their tawdry, cheesy, romantic, disgusting glory. I do. My favorite books of hers are The Game, Splendor, and Beyond Scandal.I really, really want to love After Innocence.But it's the EFFING typos. EVERY. SINGLE. DAMN. PAGE.Until the typos get fixed, I'm keeping my review one-star. I know it's not her fault, but as someone who has some serious clout in the publishing industry, she needs to effing go and slap someone upside the head until they correct the typos in this Kindle edition."
1,omfg i am soooo angry,i have never read something thatmakes me so angry. the first part was amazing i could not put it dow. but the rest!!!!!!! omg the rest is pure CRAP!!!!!!! Sofie is so dumb her mother is so evil and self centered its sad. sofie repeatedly denies edward of his daughter when it is his right for her own selfish reasons. he misses her birth and when she finally tells him and he finds the she runs aways and he spends weeks searching for them. all because she loves him and cant bare that he doesnt love her back. she deprivedthat poor child of a father for 5 months and the poor man becomes distraught looking for them. she refused to give him a chance to be in his daughter's life from the start even though she prayed to be pregnant with HIS baby. how dumb.i cant believe i stayed up all night to read this load of craaaaaaaaaap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Very good second half,"I loved this book, but only after a 170 pages. At the beginning, Sofie was so naive and immature, that it was a painful read. I wanted her to grow up quickly, so that she didn't sound so pathetic and needy. But she does come into her own in Paris, and its a wonderful book after that. The story then is more between a man and woman rather than between a man and a very young girl. So if you can hold on for the first couple hundred pages, you will be glad you did."
3,After Incense (typo intended),"The story was enjoyable - the secondary characters were were not my favorite but they and the sudden disappearance of the our dear heroine's bum ankle were all tolerable. What took me totally by surprise were the numerous typos in the last half of the book (Kindle). I must say though that the ""twenty-live"" years old, and ""... Rachelle had taken Edana ""alter"" her feeding, were good for a chuckle as was Edward calling his daughter ""Edam"" instead of Edana - but the expletive ""Oh Cod, we just made love"" had me rolling on the floor! Some books remain unforgettable to the reader and such will be the case for me and After Innocence. Oh Cod, how could I ever forget ... the typos??"
4,Great,"It was a wonderful story, very romantic and I couldn't put it down. I would recommend this one!"
3,3.5 Stars for a Heavy Read,"This is a good books. Th characters are interesting and I couldn't put it down and that was part of the problem. I tend to read romance for fun and a light read and this isn't a light read. I wasn't really expecting it to be light, but it was way heavier then I like. If you like this sort of story, then its great, but I'm more of a lightweight myself :) I found it really hard to admire the heroine after she saw how much the hero loved his daughter and still took her away without telling him. I just didn't see that he ever did anything to really deserve her leaving him twice. Also, the subplot with the Mom and Dad was interesting, but I like happy endings for all characters, even the less then nice characters, so I'd hoped the Mom and Dad would get back together and it's sad to see her being rejected, even after all she did. Anyway, the story is good, but heavy"
3,A decent read but sort of goofy..................,I wish this one could have been better. I hate reading a book that's not worthy of at least 4 stars. Maybe you'll find it more appealing. I'm not going to share more of my thoughts and give away the story.
2,Only one speaker works,"I bought these yesterday for my computer for self-protection from my neighbor's music. One of the speakers works great but there is almost no sound coming out of the other one, so not quite what I bargained for. I thought maybe I was deaf in my left ear so I switched them around. Nope; my hearing's fine."
2,really bad for listening to music,"I guess these would be OK if all you used them for was to watch TV shows or spoken word videos on your computer, but any music sounds just horrible. No bass, muffled treble, I have to say these are the worst computer speakers I've ever had. They are going in the trash soon. Quite confused by the 5 star reviews, because I have to agree with the other reviewers that these are really bad speakers."
2,Horrible sound,"Would definitely not buy again, nor recommend, these speakers. They do alright for watching movies, but music either constantly knocks out one speaker, or you get a cracking/popping sound at the absolute lowest volume. Even worse with the slightest bass."
3,Works well for $10 speakers,"They produce quality sound up until a certain point. At that point, they crackle and make static-like noises. You can't ""blast"" it, which was slightly disappointing."
1,IStatic in one speaker,"I purchased these apeakers from Target and while one speaker works great, the other has static even at low volumes. Terrible sound. I can't turn anything up. Do not waste your money."
1,Not good!,"Everything about these speakers is bad! Sound quality is just plain bad! Peal-off the cheap, plastic griddle and take a look at the speaker! That'll show you. It's like a piece of craft paper! Highs are fuzzy, mids are distorted and bass is putrid! And if it's not bad enough that they sound so bad, they have to look like Coneheads too! I forgot to mention the transformer is on the end of the plug. Great idea, GE. Thanks. And all this can be yours for the great price of $20! I'd suggest not buying these, unless you want to pull an evil prank on somebody you hate by giving these to them as a gift."
1,They really suck,"I paid $10 for them to provide audio to a mobile projector and they do the job. The sound quality is very poor but if you need something for their utility and low price, these will work. I would not pay $20 (Current Amazon price)."
1,Rip off,"This is just a bad printing of screen grabs from the net. The photos are missing and two of the pages are missing text. I have since found out that this book can be downloaded in pdf form, for free with pictures, and better text, from the Open Library : [...]Amazon should not be selling these ""books""There seem to be quite a few around and not always recognisable."
1,Save Your money,"Save your money. I got this book hoping to learn about pharmaceutical industry and I found myself reading pages of a ""yes"" and ""no"" answers with lots of blanks. No good substance for those seeking employment in the pharmaceutical filed. Maybe a highschool graduate could find a tip or two about interview skills but that's all about it. Besides this book promises you something but it fails to deliver."
3,"I Enjoyed the Story, but it was just Okay!","I enjoyed this story okay. The romance between Drew and Sydney was great. The dialogue was good, however it was just okay. The story had the potential to be great though, however Ms. Green totally re-wrote Drew's character. She explained that he was actually a retired ex-undercover agent, instead of the reckless,carefree, irresponsible, but likable character in Endless Love. That's all well and good but where was Margaret in the storyline. At the retirement party in Endless Love, Drew and Margaret (Terra's friend) eloped to Vegas. The relationship is not even mentioned in this book. At least with Michael and April, she took the time to explain why they broke up, paving the way for Terra. What about Drew and Margaret? She didn't end the previous story, before she introduced a whole new story. Therefore, although I really liked the chemistry between Drew and Sydney, the story was just okay because it lacked consistency."
4,Best in the Crawford series,"4 stars - This is the best book in the Crawford series, takes place 6 months after 'Kissed'. Seems a bit more realistic than the other Crawford titles. Good to hear from the secondary characters: Nick/Jade, Eric/Lauren, Shayla and introduces more relatives - the female cousins and Drew's parents (thought his dad was dead in Endless Love?). Would like to read more books about this family (Edwin and Julian never had a book or even Jett's story) but wondered what ever happened to the lady Drew eloped with in Endless Love there was no mention of her at all?"
3,Scandalous!,Sydney Morris and Drew Crawford are not happy with each other. They both own businesses on the same block however Drew wants Sydney to close her business down. These two rivals can't seem to fight their growing attraction.This was an enjoyable read.
1,"Pieces missing, but enjoyable.","I love this guy, but mine had a bag missing and now I cant finish building him and i want a replacement, but I luv this guy and i wanna play with it fast, it isnt hard to build, just a bag with pieces missing makes me wanna break the thing."
1,Do not buy this toy!,This was a Christmas present for our 8 year old son. It came in about 800 pieces and was missing the bonus item. This item is not preassembled! My husband has been a mechanic for 10 years and it took him 6 hours to put this toy together. When put together the toy did not work properly and then proceeded to fall apart.
4,"Get the ""new"" version","This is one of the more difficult Zoids to assemble but is well worth the effort. My 9 year old was able to do it with a minimal amount of help. One thing....get the box labeled with the ""new"" sticker. The original had a flaw that prevented several of the lights and movements from occurring. Hasbro will send a replacement product but that's a hassle."
4,"Tough as nails, but fun to build","This Zoid will eat the competition for lunch! This is one of the largest Zoids ever produced! I definately recomend this Zoid for someone who loves Zoids. Be forewarned though, this is one of the more dificult Zoids to build. If you don't take your time, you may screw up. Buy this only if you are serious about it. If you just want something to do, build something a little simpler. If you think you're ready, though, buy it NOW! This bad boy is huge, so don't let the price fool you! This is the cheapest I have ever seen him! I bought mine for like 50 Mr. Bucks! This is the deal of a lifetime! If you want a challenge, whip out your wallet and let the fn begin!"
3,Placebo...,"I think this may have been released in haste in some ways. After being dropped from Geffen one begins to wonder one 's worth as well as a groups longevity. Perhaps Ken's title to his solo demo effort in 1997 summed it up best ""This Sounds Like Good bye"".""You're The Beautiful One"", ""Placebo"" and ""Every Bitter Drop"" show promise, but the rest of the songs fall short of what they achieved in their previous three cd releases on Geffen."
3,Not Their Best,"I'm one of those that feel The Posies are a painfully underrated band. Unfortunately Success doesn't have nearly the kind of brilliant song writing that was evident on their earlier releases like Frosting On The Beater and Dear 23. The melodies, harmonies and moving lyrics of those two recordings make for some memorable listening. Success has only faint glimpses of that sound which makes it only mildly enjoyable. Obviously it's impossible to always achieve that perfect blend that makes a great song. The Posies were capable of doing it with amazing regularity. I think this time they missed the mark."
4,A nice return to form--and hopefully not the final act,"This is the last studio album (to date) by the Posies, who may or may not have broken up for good. This band is the Everly Brothers of the grunge world, with an effortless sense of pop melody, a keen ear for chord changes, and KILLER two-part harmonies. ""Success"" is a return to form for the Posies after the angry, dispirited ""Amazing Disgrace"". This album is full of great songs, from the pure pop of ""Somehow Everything"" and ""Farewell Typewriter"" to the synthesized ""Start a Life"", the full-out rock of ""Looking Lost"", and the wistful ballads ""You're the Beautiful One"" and ""Every Bitter Drop"". My favorite song is the careening ""Fall Apart with Me"". The Posies aren't the greatest musicians in the world, but they play exactly what the song needs, and they know how to use the whisper-to-a-scream dynamic range to full effect."
5,A classic poker diary,"British journalist Holden recounts a year in his life spent travelling the world playing poker, his training course for the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas.A classic of poker writing, it makes me ask whether all poker writers know each other. The other best-read in the category is A. Alvarez's The Biggest Game in Town. Alvarez and Holden are regulars at their Tuesday Night Game in London. Another well-known author David Spanier (Total Poker) reports on Holden's playing for a UK newspaper.The book is wide-ranging: from a brief history of the game to exciting card-by-card retelling of hands. It even teaches you the odds in Texas Hold 'Em. If you like the game, you will enjoy this book.Follow this up with Positively Fifth Street by James McManus, a new poker saga inspired by Holden and Alvarez."
5,I love this book,"What makes this book great, is that Holden is a writer first, and a poker player second. One of the best books on gambling ever written."
2,Pocket 77,"To me this book was like pocket sevens, you feel bad throwing it away, but it's really not worth your time. Interesting at times, some good stories, but not all that great."
4,A small book with big information...,"**** This self-help book can help readers locate the healing foods that are currently missing from their diets. Many people do not realize simple things, such as thoroughly chewing food before swallowing, can actually help the body extract more nutrition from every bit. Did you know that memory loss may be nothing more than an amino acid deficiency? There are foods that improve sexual performance and others that could cause hair loss.This book is packed with valuable information. The back pages are filled with other resources you might wish to view on the net. It is a small book that could change your life in a big way. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch"
1,H.S. Biology Tutor book not yet received in the mail,I have not received this book I ordered many weeks ago. I am hoping I would still receive it even though it's been awhile back. I cannot rate this item well because I have not received it.
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!!!,"This movie was atrocious! I'm a fan of low-budget horror films, but this put the genre to shame! Aside from the quality of poor VHS to DVD transfer (turn the volume ALL THE WAY UP, but watch out when the AWFUL music chimes in INCESSANTLY throughout the movie), you need a PhD to follow the story line. It was so ridiculous that we laughed through the whole movie; it should've been categorized under ""Comedy""."
4,Scary!,I found this horror film set in a nut house really messed with my mind...jermy minns who plays the lead actor was chilling realistic in the portayal of the doctor gone mad. Really atmospheric
5,Masterpiece,"I got this book for my mother in law in Germany and she really liked it. I read it in Italian and don't speak German, so I can't guarantee on the translation but the edition is very good. The book is a classic masterpiece."
3,"Nice CD, but could have had a great potential to be a top cd",The harmony is excellant on the cd and the overall songs but not much for a classic cd. Good to listen to and shows the potential they have to become big if they get some more nice r&b grooves.
5,Divine Fairy Tales. Very cute girl group.,"Divine Fairy Tales CD came out late 1998. This one is worth keeping. These cuties only came out this title ""Fairy Tales"". The songs are beautiful. Lately is very beautiful. I'll still listen to them. I love Divine and I wish that they had came with a few more. By 2001, the girls had disappeared for good. A girl group of late 1990's like Divine is worth keeping in your archives."
3,"THE GROUP SOUNDS OK, BUT THEY DONT HAVE THE LOOK.","I HAVE LISTENED TO SOME OF THEIR INTERVIEW'S ON RADIO STATIONS AND ON T.V. I KNOW FOR SURE THAT KIA LIED ABOUT HER AGE. DO NOT GET ME WRONG THERE IS SOME TALENT IN THIS GROUP. MY FAVORITE SINGER OUT OF IT IS THE ONE WITH THE SHORT HAIR, SHE SPEAKS VERY WELL AND SHE CARRIES HERSELF WELL. FIVE STARS TO HER AND 0 FOR KIA."
5,I love this CD,"I love this CD because it reminds me of when I first met the man of my dreams. I heard the song Lately when I first figured out that I liked him, so everytime I hear this song I think of that special moment."
5,The CD Fairytales is beautiful just like Divine is.,"First of all Jasmine Codlier should learn how to spell before she tries to boo someone of a stage. Divine are beautiful ladies and they sing like it. I love all of the songs on the Cd especially One More Try and I Wish. They're harmonies are so melodic and All that you Need is funky. I recommend that everyone go out and buy this Cd and call your radio stations and make sure they play all of their cuts on the radio. Also, I love their new video for One More Try they are truly beautiful and nice young ladies (not all hoochified). Hey Jasmine clear out your ears!!!"
5,Divine's ablum is a fantastic blend of harmony and pop.,"I have always loved one of the singers in Divine, Tonia. Although I didn't think that I would love the group. This was a very bad judgement on my behalf. This group is fun and spunky. The music makes me want to get up and dance. I believe that they have what it takes to be a great success. I really loved the album and all of the songs."
3,a good try.,"the song LATELY is da bomb, and the rest of the album is OK. It gets kinda annoying, but the talent is there."
5,Blazin,This album truly shows how talented these ladies are. Go cop this one! The songs are all tight and they sound DIVINE!
5,DIVINE IS ALL THAT AND MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THE GROUP DIVINE IS SUPERB, NOT ONLY BECAUSE NIKKI IS MY YOUNGEST SISTER. FIRST OF ALL MS. JASMINE CORDIER, IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE JUDGEMENTAL, DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. DON'T EVER COME OFF DISSING ABOUT EXCELLENT TALENT!!!!! I HAVE TO GIVE THE BIGGEST PROPS WHEN THEY'RE DUE. DIVINE IS A TRIO OF BLACK,TALENTED,CLASSY AND HARMONIZED YOUNG WOMEN. MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM IS ""SWEET ESSENCE,"" BECAUSE IT BEST DESCRIBES THE LOVE WITHIN A PERSON. I GIVE THE ALBUM A 10 AND GIRLS KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. DIVINE YOU'RE THE BEST AND I LOVE YOU."
5,great satire,"really need to get more of his work, this man is hilarious, would love to see a video of his act"
2,I'm disapointed that this is all music and not comedy,"I love Billy Connelly's stand up comedy routines and world tour programs and all, but i was a wee bit disapointed when I kept waiting for Billy to tell some jokes, but there is very little comedy in between every track on the album being a song.Some of the songs are fun, but not hilarious. Most of them are Billy's pasion for music as he disaplys his musical talent. I'm sure the people who love folk music would love this album, and I can't really judge Billy's music or not 'cause i'm just not into that sorta thing.But i felt i better warn any one who are like me and purchased it expecting comedy and not having more then a whiskers of it on this album.It's a shame I cant rate it as ""skip the vote"" i dont want to say I hate it, it's just not my cup of tea."
4,Older songs which Billy rarely gets around to now days.,"This album appears to explore the more musical Billy Connolly as many of these tunes are more sentimental and less jocular. However, a few of the distinctive Connolly expectations are on there."
4,great condition.,"book in excellent condition, thank you for delivering in my time frame, rapid delivery on text books is always my main concern."
5,EVELYN NESBIT AND STANFORD WHITE LOVE AND DEATH IN THE GILED,I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THIS BOOK BEEN LOOKING FOR IT FOR A LONG WHILE FOR STORYS ABOUT EVELYN CAUSE I USED TO AS A TEENAGER GO TO THE HOUSE THAT HER AND HUSBAND LIVED THEN IT WAS A BOARDING PLACES FOR HORSES AND A DINNER I WAS TOLD ABOUT THE STORY MENY TIMES BUT THE BOOK IS GREAT
1,You can only watch this on amazon's service or a kindle fire.. WHAT A LOAD OF GARBAGE,"I read their product page and it says you can download the purchase. Then after you purchase, it said that you can only download if you have a kindle fire or other kindle device that can playback video. So, this was a waste of $2 and left my 3 year old unhappy bc I couldn't get it to play on her innotab. I will never make another Amazon digital purchase again."
5,For my 2 yr old son,My 2 yr old loves this show and has enjoyed watching it a few times. He loves this particular episode so it makes him happy
2,You can hear the narration,You can hear the narrator talking in the background (not supposed to happen). This is the only reason it gets two stars. Great episode though!
2,Why?,We usually enjoy all the UmiZoomi episodes but why have one to encourage the child to play in the rain? We've enjoyed every other episode but I try to convince him to avoid this one.
4,Vietnamese Children Songs - Book/CD,"I bought this book for our son (1 year old) who is growing up bilingual. He loves the music and moves his arms to it (his version of dancing); the tunes are very catchy and you can listen to them many times (even on repeat) and still enjoy them. The songs are a mixture of American (translated to Vietnamese) and Vietnamese songs; I mostly enjoy the Vietnamese one's.One of the two singers (Kelly Vu) does not get all the Vietnamese tones right (or as my wife puts it: she sounds a bit like me). In any case, it is sung in the Southern Vietnamese accent. The book contains the lyrics (very good), it's black-and-white inside. Overall, good - our son really likes it."
3,Songs and lyrics don't all line up,"I like this book and CD, but two of the songs from the book have their CD tracks misplaced at the end of the CD-- rather confusing."
3,Not very helpful to learn the language,"It's a cute book and cute songs, but very difficult to really follow along and learn anything."
5,I love this book/CD combo,"I am a Vietnamese American, born in Saigon but raised in the States. I still speak Vietnamese at home, but do not know any Vietnamese songs to sing to our daughter. My husband is Caucasian, so we are trying to teach our daughter both English and Vietnamese. What's so great about this set is that I can understand what they're singing, but sometimes the words go by so fast that I can't learn the song by the CD alone, so the book is an excellent way for me to learn the words. My husband is also trying to learn Vietnamese, so it is great for him as well. The songs on the CD are clear and very easy to listen to. Even my Mom and Aunt (pure old school Vietnamese) are very impressed with the book/CD. I would definitely recommend this set!"
1,A CASSETTE TAPE!,"Are you kidding me?! Seriously, why would any product in 2012 come with a cassette tape?!I don't know what's more upsetting, the fact that it came with one or that there was no mention that it was going to come with one. Even my family members in a third world country would not have a cassette player nor would they use cassette tapes anymore. Is this some kind of joke? Did you expect me to give this as a gift to my little niece and have her rewind in a dinosaur cassette player in order to listen to the songs again?!This was really absurd to receive and cannot believe that AMAZON would even carry this or have this distributed without thinking about the product quality and the quality of life. Was this in storage from the 80s? I'm not looking for memorabilia but an actual product that can be used in 2012. This was upsetting enough to make me want to no order from AMAZON again. A cassette tape...omg."
2,Beautifully designed cover but overpriced,"My daughter and I enjoyed the book but only one. Here are a few reasons why I liked ""Sing 'n Learn Vietnamese""-Beautifully designed cover;-Enclosed CD with songs;-Written in Vietnamese;Here are parts which could use a lot of improvements:-No musical score. My daughter would love to play some of these songs since she is taking piano lessons.-Black and white paper. Add more color illustration please.-Overpriced; I believed the fair price for this item should be no more than $7.99-A lot of these so-called songs are actually nursery rhymes, e.g. Con Meo` Tre`o Le^n Cay Cau.-A few of them are actually originally written in English and French, e.g., The Yellow Butterfly and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.-Please produce more authentic Vietnamese songs. I actually don't recognize over half of the songs in the book even though I grew up in Viet Nam for over fifteen years.I would give this song book two stars. I would rather borrow from the library instead."
5,Laughed Out Loud,This book is hilarious! I just couldn't stop lauging. Can't wait for the next Haskell Blevins mystery!
3,"Squirrels 1, feeder 0",This feeder did keep the squirrels from raiding the seed. But something made the cage fall off. I assume it was the very determined squirrel that was all over it trying to get at the seed. I could not see what part failed. The feeder is at the service shop being repaired. Thank goodness for the lifetime guarantee.
5,"It is squirrel proof, and small birds love it","It is squirrel proof, and small birds love itWould recommend - daughter loves it - Christmas gift she likes"
5,Best feeder for protecting birds,"It's hard to find a better feeder that shields the feeding birds from the elements and predators. Also, spacing of the grid is large enough to keep the birds from getting a wing or toe trapped if panicked. Great gift for anyone with a cat that likes to feed wild birds."
3,Keeps Squirrels Out!,"The cage on this feeder does a great job of keeping the squirrels out! Unfortunately, the cage is also keeping the birds out. We have plenty of birds small enough to fit in, but it must be scaring them because after more than 3 weeks outside it is still full."
2,Great storybut the acting is poor.,I love the story line but the acting is so poor that it is distracting. I do not recommend this movie.
4,Essential for those working with chronic illnesses,The book is written for therapists and as such it is a bit dense. The information and examples are wonderful. It covers this important topic beautifully. I believe anyone working with chronic illness will recognize the need for this book.
5,sick,"which reviewer said ""not a throwaway in the bunch""? tru dat. tru dat. this thing is hot end to end. i don't know what's gonna become of me--i can't stop listening to it. matter fact, i gotta go now--the last track is ending and i gotta go flip it back to the first track."
5,Instant Classic,"Simply THE album of 2005, ""This Journey In"" blows away the soulless, prepackaged, commercial drivel that somehow passes as r&b music today. More than just a ""neosoul"" group, the Rebirth blends warm vocals, jazzy chord changes, and grooves a mile wide into a sound that is obviously influenced by 70s-era soul/jazz/funk (e.g. Mizell brothers, Leon Ware, Roy Ayers) yet is not derivative, as elements of drum and bass, house, and hip hop are seemlessly infused. Highly recommended."
2,"Why The Hype, This is Atrocious","Sorry to say, this is plain awful. Sure, the drummer can play, too bad the guitarist can't. There is so much untapped potential here. This is just two dudes making a racket. People compare this to Don Cab, these guys have nothing on them.Unless you really strive to listen to this type of music, say away...if you can stomach this stuff, I am in awe."
2,Show off,"I think I still have to listen to this album a few more times to put it away for good, but there's one thing, the drummer is not as good as everyone says. He misses the beat a lot of times and besides he keeps trying to show just how good he is and how fast he can do his breaks, sorry!"
3,Meth rock,"3 1/2Scattershot bursts of adrenaline guitar and drum experiments may rub non-thrill seekers the wrong way, but make no mistake; even if everything can feel a bit fragmented or vacant, the level of math-rock synergy is often absurdly impressive. Start by appreciating small obviously-skull-smashing chunks and process your way from there."
4,"Gloria Reveals her ""Party"" Side","Once again, Gloria displays excellent 'energy' in her video titled, ""Don't Stop."" It goes behind the scenes between the music videos. Personally, I would have liked to have seen a little more of this. Perhaps 'Turn the Beat Around' should not have been included in this video."
4,Broken on arrival,Rotor was broken upon arrival. Too inexpensive to return. No worth my time to package up and send back.
1,Don't bother - it's nearly impossible to replace,"original rotor can't be removed without breaking copter, or once replaced, no longer has any lift."
3,Replacement Rotors for Helicopters,"I had an air hog remote control helicopter that needed replacement rotors.Needless to say the replacements didn't work out.As someone said these are relatively inexpensive toys but when they break(which is very soon,they become expensive.I wasted $13.Would have been better off buying a new unit for the $20 or so dollars and been more careful where I flew."
3,"Good value but,",We really did not need these because the helicopter wore out before the props. We did not need these because the body of the helicopter fell apart.
1,Does not fit description,"The item description states that it is a replacement rotor that fits ""AirHogs Havoc"" mini helicopter.FYI it is NOT the same rotor as a the AirHog Havoc model. What arrived in my mail box looks nothing like the pictured product from the website, nor does it look anything like the actual rotor from the Havoc. Also this replacement appears to be made of a lighter less durable material, I'm guessing one crash and it's toast. Granted I can't prove that last statement because the retailer mailed it to us in a regular envelope with no padding, so the part arrived broken... Thanks to Amazon, the refund process went reasonbly well, no hassels other than driving down to UPS.All in all, I applaud the customer service - but Boo the product in general."
2,"Works, but....","Got this for a Air Hog Havok that I got at Walmart. Broke the main rotor the first day and got these to replace. The stock main rotor was a real pain to remove, I had to basically cut the plastic shaft off of the metal center shaft. Used a bit of super glue to get the new rotor to stay on as others posted. Broke the new rotor after about 20 minutes of fly time and couldn't get it off. It's true what they say, you get what you pay for, don't buy cheap helicopters thinking they'll last you long."
3,replacement part for havoc heli,I only used the top section of the rotor but it snapped into place perfectly on my old air hogs chopper. I did not feel too comfortable removing the entire assembly so I was glad that I did not have to deal with the fit on the main rotor shaft.this product worked great for me.
4,review,"the product had to be customized by me to funtion properly, otherwise fine... however I feel tne shipping was too expensive"
2,Not for the Air Hogs Havoc,"The item description says that the rotor is compatible with the Air Hogs Havoc helicopter. It's not. The rotor doesn't generate enough lift to fly the helicopter. I tried a dab of superglue to make sure that the rotor was attached to the stem, but it wasn't a matter of the stem spinning inside the rotor. It simply isn't designed to lift this helicopter. Returned. For what it's worth, the rotor seems to be built pretty well, just not right for the Havoc."
3,beware of replacement parts,These rotors will not work on a Havoc Heli by Airhogs. It was recommended to me by Amazon so I bought it. It is an unreplacable part. The rotor is connected to the motor. Beware
3,Spare replacement helicoptor rotors,"I bought replacement main & tail rotors for my Air Hog R/C helicoptor I have. I've not yet had to replace them, so can't really rate their performance, but they look fine."
1,Not enough lift,Installation was easy but it doesn't provide enough lift to get helicopter off the ground. It just sits there and spins.
1,Replacement rotor,"I just purchased replacement rotor blades for my son's helicopter. The blades were so poorly made that they did not survive the shipping. After looking at the blades they would not have held up anyways since again, they were made very poorly. I would not reccomend purchasing the replacement blades from Drangonfly."
5,A Much Anticipated Release,"Following the 300th anniversary of Edwards, the popularity of John Piper and Christian Hedonism and a resurgence of Edwards scholars, the great American theologian may now be more popular than ever. Yale has been working on publishing the definitive Edwards collection from their vast collection of his original manuscripts and through tedious effort have produced a fine volume in ""The Blank Bible.""We have all read Edwards sermons, and many of us have plowed through his other works, but to search and find his notes on each individual text of Scripture is enthralling to the fan of Edwards. His vision of the glory of God pours through these pages. Furthermore, through reading the notes you see the mind of America's greatest theologian in its most raw form. This volume is highly recommended."
2,Good ideas but NOT 100% VEGETARIAN,"This is an OK book for gathering ideas for vegetarian sushi, but appears to be written by somebody that has no clue what a vegetarian is. There are recipes that are vegan, and others that are ovo-vegetarian, but Brigid seems to be clueless as to what a vegetarian is, as her dashi recipes all call for fish flakes. Also, she lists seafood possibilities for various sushi types.It's not a bad read, and there is good information, but it's yet another book written by a non-vegetarian without bothering to ensure that the recipes are at least lacto-ovo.It's a disappointment that in a book called vegetarian sushi, there are so many refs to seafood and recipes that call for meat products. Especially considering that the typical American mis-conception of sushi is fish, and this book claims to provicde vegetarian recipes."
3,not totally vegetarian,i was looking for a strict vegetarian sushi book and this book often uses bonito which is a fish product...
1,Vegetarian Sushi?,"This book has everything it needs to pass as great to the majority of the population; glossy photos, cute names, and it's about sushi.Very trendy.As a Vegan, I was not as impressed. The stock recipes include bonito (dried fish), and offered no substitutions for it. Several of the recipes called for the stock, or water. Water doesn't add any flavor to food, obviously. So it's either fish, or a substandard dish. The author also includes seafood suggestions on nearly every page. The last time I checked, fish are living creatures. Fish are not vegetables.I expected a few mentions of egg or dairy, it is a supposedly Vegetarian book. But I can't say I expected flesh to be involved in the cooking process.Before becoming Vegan, I had never eaten sushi due to my allergy to seafood. So if you have a similar allergy and are looking to enjoy Sushi, I would recommend searching elsewhere."
3,This is not vegetarian!,"I am a vegetarian, and love sushi. Since so much sushi is sashimi, I wanted to find a good resource for vegetarian sushi. I was pleased to find a book titled exactly that. However, when I cracked the book open, I was taken aback by the multitude of ""variations"" for the recipes that call for seafood and fish. And the soups all call for dashi, with the provided dashi recipe, which uses bonito, or dried fish flakes. The book does note underneath that ""for a purely vegetarian version"" you can use double the miso in place of the bonito. This makes no sense to me at all, since the inclusion of fish makes it completely non-vegetarian. It has no place in a book titled ""Vegetarian Sushi.""The photos were lovely, but I was hoping for more step-by-step photos on how to actually assemble and roll the sushi.All in all, this book fell flat. It didn't commit to being what it was intended to be, and didn't make me feel like I could competently take on sushi armed with what I'd learned."
2,"This cd had an all star cast, but came up short.........","What happens when you assemble an all star cast? Usually you get superb results. In this case this project came up a little short. It apears, despite this brilliant cast, that the repertoire was the down fall of this project. There were too few really good songs performed here.To defend this all star group, I would like to say that all the musicians did a great job with their performances. They all measured up to their super star billing. If they would have choosen a better repertoire, then this would have been nothing short of a great cd.This cd is about average, but nothing close to being great. Once again, I think repertoire is everything, just about.Recommendation: I wouldn't buy this cd."
4,Great starting point for your little magician,I got this for my 11 year old and he loves it! We got it in December '09 and he still doing new tricks and loving the art of illusion even more!
4,Magic Set was a winner at Christmas!,"My seven year old grandson really liked his magic set he received at Christmas. It was fairly complete with books and instructional help. There were cups and rings, scarves, cards ect. There was a little stand included that was a mini stage to perform magic tricks. All in all it was well worth the cost and contained more tricks for the money than most sets I've seen. Treat it with care, though, as some parts are not very durable. I would recommend it for a gift to any young aspiring magician under the age of ten."
4,Nice Set,"This is a very nice set. My 7 year old daughter asked for a magic set for Christmas and I went all out... I think it's a bit much for YOUNGer children... The table top set up is not that easy and doesn't store easily back in the box, not for my taste... It does appear to be a very nice set... Not bad quality! Just maybe too much for my child at this point."
3,Grand daughter's Christmas prersent,The crystal box wasn't in good shape as it wouldn't lock so it slid open when tilted. The multiplyinig balls are too slick to use. Otherwise the set was fine.
3,The set is really neat. the magic dvd was a huge disappointment.,"I was very happy with the set. However,the dvd that came with the set was not for my region and so my daughter could not watch the dvd. Im in the U.S. so im thinking the disc was maybe a europe region disc."
3,Not bad,"I read this book as a companion to the Camulud Chronicles by Jack Whyte, It is of the same time period, and gives an insight into the lives of the Northsmen, who are the enemies of the prime players in the other books--and to the armies of Normandy. For those reasons, it is worth the read, but as a stand-alone novel, I wouldn't bother."
2,Could have been better,"This is a fast paced story of WWII commandos using Alistair Maclean's characters from his two Navarone books. It is not as good as Maclean's books or even Llewellyn's own Storm Force from Navaone - the novel appears to have been rushed to publication without being fully developed or edited. However, it was enjoyable to read and difficult to put down."
1,Not a winning combination,"Like the other reviewer, Robert Dinger, I have really enjoyed Sam Llewellyn. I am also a great fan of Alistair MacLean's earlier works. If you expect a winning combination in THUNDERBOLT FROM NAVARONE, though, you will be sorely disappointed. The story was not captivating, the characters were not interesting. The cliff-hangers were paraded past like a sad Indiana Jones wanna-be. This is no successor for Alistair MacLean. Again, Sam Llewellyn's yacht racing mysteries are very enjoyable, especially if you're a Dick Francis fan, and I am looking forward to the next one of those."
1,not worth it,"I bought this product as a tempory replacement for my rangehood as its was cheap and offered free shipping. Honestly I wasn't expecting a 5 star product but i wasn't expecting a no star product also, this filter is the most inferior filter I ever saw. It is simply just a wire mesh with no real filtration material in it to allow it to be called or used as a rangehood filter, you might as well just not use a filter on your hood if you plan on using this one. This product is not worth any amount of money you spend for it, you might as well put a few extra bucks and buy one that will actually do it's job.I will STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN PUCHASING A RANGEHOOD FILTER."
2,Enough allready!,"I loved the first two books, however, after that she should have stopped. By the time I got to this book I was so unbelievably sick of hearing about how she was guilty about her past and so on. I just wanted to say, 'get over it!' I also found it very depressing, one bad thing happens after another, there is no hope ever! I was so sick of it it gave me a headache. I don't think I will continue to read Gardens of Shadows."
3,Okay ending to the series...,"I loved the whole Dollanganger series, but I have to admit I was getting a little tired of the whole thing by the beginning of this book. The first two books were wonderful, the third one was kind of fragmented because of its inconsistent story-telling style, but the plot was interesting enough to keep me reading. This book, however, turned out to be so dark and dreary that it was just plain depressing to read it. There can only be so much tragedy to hit one family before it just gets irritating. Definitely read this book to finish up the series, so you know what happens to all of them, but don't expect it to be spectacular or anything....and don't expect a happy ending either."
3,Could have been better,This book could use a little spicing up don`t you think? Cathy was pretty noisy. Bart is still confused. Joel the long lost uncle gives me the creeps. Chris and Cathy need to learn that what their doing is not right. Jory is to be pitied. Melodie is ssssooooo WEAK! (...)
2,Ugh,I hated this book. I was so disappointed after I was done reading it. It was very boring and nothing happened. No crazy twist or anything. I had all these ideas on how the story could have came out so I was so excited when I started reading it but it turned out to be a huge waste of time. I know for a fact V.C. Andrwes(the real one) would have done the story justices.
4,seeds of yesterday,"the book seeds of yesterday was not what i thought it would be. i have every other book in the series and this one was a big letdown. i thought it would have been a more exciting ending. And i did not like barts attitude and how he used his brothers wife. I understand that cathy favored jory.....but bart was just plain evil. But what did sadden me however was how cathy and chris died. I was clearly intruged with their ""realationship"" and i did want to cry when cathy died as she died a sadder way than chris. I hope to read more VC ANDREWS books in the near future"
3,I cannot believe this ending..,"I give this book three stars because it was well written for the most part and I loved revisiting these characters, but the ending was just terrible. Bart becomes an evangelist? Totally not believable. This ending was rushed. It's like what should have been four or five chapters all squeezed in to one. I absolutely hated the ending. Perhaps if it had be stretched and I had learned the details leading up to the way things turned out, it wouldn't be so bad but instead I was left feeling no closure. It made me pretty angry after spending so much time with this series and getting to know and love the characters. I felt cheated."
1,A really bad book,"This was the dopiest book I've ever read. I had read the others in the series and slogged through this one just to see how it all ended. The dialog was incredibly bad - NO ONE talks like that! And why did this amazingly disfunctional family keep on living together when every encounter led to bickering, hurt feelings and family secrets revealed? And everyone continued to ""love"" Bart even though he kept the family in constant turmoil and was downright mean. Plot lines from other books in the series were repeated. We never find out who was responsible for all the mysterious things that happened. And the ending! Simply awful. Who wrote this thing?"
5,Bravo!,"This book is well the final in the series and a very good novel.It deals with Jory,now a grown man,who becomes a famouse ballet star,and well,due to some accident,is injured and paralyed forever!His wife then leaves him and things go bad for him...Bart on the other hand is refurbished from the previous novel and he becomes a lawyer.He also wants the Foxworth hall to be rebuilt...A stranger moves in and the story grows!...The ending of this story is sad,because Chris dies!and alot more happens,I guess you would just have to read to find out,because I am trying my best not to give away much...In this novel,VC again combines all the things you could want in a great drama/suspense novel...and she succeeds...enjoy...Nigel."
3,Sad and predictable,"Predictable:Although this is the first book that I read of the series and I don't know if a will read the first three, I can say that you will know exactly what will happen in the next page of the book since the beginning till the end, nevertheless the book will keep you reading and trying to guess what will happen next, of course I would make some changes to the end of the book.Sad:First of all is very sad that two brothers love each other in other way than brothers, how many times a woman can be a widow? How many times can a mother catch her daughter in bed with her boyfriend? And I'm not talking about the accidents, the way that Bart made everything his own way... and many things more. This book will really make you cry."
1,I don't like Cathy,"Poor Bart has been treated like Cinderfella by Cathy for years. The poor boy has been bumped aside for an adopted stranger named Cindy who is a real spoiled horror and dancing Jory. When Jory loses his ability to dance, it was hoped Cathy would place value on humanity and character and not dancing. She is a shallow fool.Cindy is a provocative little tart. She seduces guys and reminds one of a dog in season. I'm glad Bart broke her lover's face when he caught them in the act. Cindy was stupid for not being discreet. With all her money and ""wiles,"" she could have conned her lover into taking her to a motel. She is rude, brash and saucy. She is quite the tart. Too bad Cathy never wised up to her.Stupid ending. Chris died like Chris, Sr. and Cathy never really left the attic of her youth. I'm tired of V.C. Andrews' brother and sister pairs becoming lovers. This is for the birds."
4,Enjoyed every single page,This was a great ending to a great series. It kept me hooked since the first book and it's amazing how everything comes back to the first book. The ending was a little sad considering how much the characters had to endure throughout the series. They deserved better.
4,Not bad!,This book was good though not as good as the first books. I still can't understand why Cathy and Chris would return to Foxworth Hall. I know they did it for Bart's sake but come on. It was a bit much I think especially with all the painful memories. It's one thing to endure your son like Cathy did with Bart but to endure Joel's fire and brimstone speeches too especially now? I don't think so. I did like Bart's humbling himself after Chris died though. And I was happy that Toni winded up with Jory it was fitting and deserving. Not a bad ending overall.A.M Torres author of Love Child (sold here on Amazon)
2,harder used that expected,"when i bought this book and it was used, i didn't expect it to be perfect. but it was alot ""more used"" than i was led to believe by the description. several pages were loose in the middle of the book. while i still enjoyed reading the book, i think next time i would spend the extra few dollars for a new one."
3,Too much English,I was disappointed after all my younger friends had raved about Tiziano. The CD is more like Italian Rap Music and this particular one has a lot of English lyrics. If you want Italian I don't recommend it.
4,TZN...welcome in Britain anytime!,"You can't buy this album in Britain anywhere, not even on Amazon.co.uk, and no British people have heard of him, although he is extremely popular in the rest of Europe, and rightly so! His voice is amazing; I want to turn it up loud and sing along although I don't understand a word! The only downfalls of this otherwise perfect album, are the electronic backing music, which lacks the sincerity his voice requires, and the gospel quality of his English songs. I hope he releases something in Britain soon so I won't feel so alone!"
4,le cose che non dici sono più di meno,"i absolutely love this CD it's so gorgeous, powerful and tizi has this great, treatening, loud and sexfilled voice combined with those (mosty)powerful, hard-beated songs, thst he wrote by himself! I give this album only 4 stars because of the few tracks in english which actually, really [stinks]!!! keep waking your road tzn!also soon avaiable in french"
5,I Love Tiziano,I have to say that this cd is amazing. His song perdono is so catchy. I have listened to this cd over and over again for about 2 years now & I still love it !
4,Great toaster; ridiculous sandwich cage worth less than nothing,"Toaster in red couldn't look better or work better. On the other hand, the sandwich cage is less than useless; outside of sandwich would burn before sandwich ingredients heat."
4,Canary Toaster - Dualit,"The toaster works great, a little noiser than I expected but not a disturbance. (The ticking of the timer) The littlecanary' looks great on the counter. Though it is on the expensive side, only time will tell if the expense has been worth it. For now, it has been in appearance and performance."
2,"Short lifespan, expensive to repair","I've had mine for about 3 years. The timer knob sticks more and more everyday. If you happen to be away from the toaster you could easy have a fire on your hands.Repairs aren't cheap. The toaster is over $200. To replace the timer knob, it's $149 from one USA supplier, or $60 ordering it from the UK. The repair labor is up to you.Something to consider."
1,I hate this toaster too!,"I don't understand its hefty price for its subpar performance. It will literally burn one side of the toast while barely toasting the other side. Plus, as mentioned by other reviewers, I've never been able to successfully toast a half-bagel without it getting stuck AND heaven forbid you have a slightly taller-than-average piece of bread. This was a gift, and I felt terrible about the expense they paid in relation to the loathe I feel for this contraption.We use my husband's 6+ year old, $35 Black & Decker toaster oven, and it's perfect every time."
1,not worth the hefty price,"I bought this high end toaster about 5/6 years ago. It is simple and I thought it would last forever,but a few weeks ago the heating element in one slot failed and it is now worthless. This toaster has no amenities (like auto lift), it is not particularly fast and is quite inconsistent in the darkness of the toast. Kitchen Aid makes far superior (and less expensive) toasters.Not recommended at all."
1,Don't Fall For It!,"After going through far too many cheap toasters, I decided to take a chance and buy this ridiculously priced thing, thinking it would last. No luck. One of the heating elements on this piece of junk stopped working after about a year. Now when I toast two slices of bread, only one slice is toasted. The second slice is half-toast and half hot bread. I'll be damned if I'm going to take this in to be repaired after what I paid for it. It's going in the garbage. I really thought this thing would last for a decade or more, like the toaster my parents had when I was growing up. Don't fall for the hype of an expensive brand. This thing is no better than a $20 Wal-Mart toaster. In fact, it's probably worse."
1,Great Looking but Poorly Built,"I have owned a total of 2 Dualit toasters at different times. I purchased them because I figured all toasters are going to work in about the same way and these looked particularly nice in my kitchen. Unbelievably, I have had the same issue with both toasters...the heating elements on one side fail. I use them very rarely so I don't know why this is happening. My first one failed after about a year of light use and I returned it to Williams Sonoma with no problems. I figured this was a fluke for such an expensive machine so I bought another one from Amazon in Nov. 2011. I now have the same problem with it. Amazon's refund window has passed so I guess I am stuck with this expensive POS. I am writing to Dualit to see if they can help me with this but whatever happens with me, I recommend staying away from Dualit."
2,Costly repairs are an unfortunate surprise,"I've had mine for about 3 years. The timer knob sticks more and more everyday. If you happen to be away from the toaster you could easy have a fire on your hands.Repairs aren't cheap. The toaster is over $200. To replace the timer knob, it's $149 from one USA supplier, or $60 ordering it from the UK. The repair labor is up to you.Something to consider. Great toaster otherwise."
5,LOVEEEE THIS TOASTER!!,"I cannot fathom what some of these people are thinking when they say they do not care for this toaster. I moved across 2000 miles away and have yet to bring all of my things and this is the one appliance that I miss along with my kitchenaid mixer. If you love to cook and like versatality this is the toaster for you. It has accessories to toast sandwiches instead of getting out a frying pan and it is like nothing I have ever seen on the market as far as toasters go. I bought mine in black, but am eyeing the red one that I wanted, but was not available in the USA at the time mine was purchased.(I had even called England and begged way back when!) This one is a must for my kitchen and busy life. Some things just cannot get any better."
1,"Could be lovely, but high pitched noise is terrible","I have a feeling this could have been a lovely album, but the high pitched noise (some sort of high pitched chime or something) that plays through a lot of the tracks renders it almost unlistenable to me. From other reviews I looked into it seems some people have no problem with it, while many do. So maybe you will be lucky. Just beware. The album was ruined for me by this."
1,Dangerous!!!,"My 4 yr old received as an X-Mas gift last year. The wings do fall off and are sharp. However, it was my husband who we took to the emergency room less than a week later with a stabbing injury requiring stitches. I do have to say it is durable, however. When my husband frantically pulled the base of the plane (not the wings) that was stabbing and protruding from his body and threw it against the wall, the wall dented. The plane was fine."
2,Batplane Review,"I bought this bat plane for my son, it looked like a very good product, but when he started playing with it I was quite dissapointed...the wings fall off easily-many times with out even touching them, the rocket launchers and grappling arm fall off all the time too! The figures don't fit the plane very easily (u have to twist and jam them in)and once you do it is difficult to close the cockpit. This is a cool looking toy but was VERY POORLY developed as a play toy. It great as long as you don't touch it, but since its a toy...what's the point??"
2,Poor Quality as a toy,"My son received this as a christmas gift last year. It was great at first, but soon fell apart --the wings don't stay on well, plus they are very pointy and can be dangerous to small children. I was very disappointed."
2,Poor Quality,The plane's wings constantly fall off. I had to superglue the wings and they still seem to fall off after a couple of weeks. The points on the plane's wings are kind of dangerous. My 4 year old received several different Batman toys for his birthday because he loves Batman but all have been very poorly constructed.
2,Again?,"Batman Bat Plane By Mattel?Really? I have two of the exact planes by Hasbro.I was completely disappointed in this item. Not only is it the SAME plane by Hasbro; there's NOTHING different. The least they could have done was add something. Anything.Well, they did improve the packaging. So, if you are one to keep items in the box, it will look great on display, over the Hasbro boxes.Not much I can say on this. A real disappointment from Mattel.Bottomline:Pros: The box is an improvement over Hasbro's.Cons: It's Hasbro's leftovers, repainted.Score: 0. When one took credit for someone else's work in school, it was called cheating, and plagerism. Here, it's called cheating too; and, Mattel deserves no credit for Hasbro's Batplane."
3,OK Giallo,"You have to be in the right state of mind to enjoy this movie. The plot becomes so confusing halfway , one can't really tell what's going on. Many will simply turn off the TV, but if you're patient you will be rewarded with an pretty interesting ending. Film has all the familiar trappings: beautiful scenery, beautiful women, including a very sexy Suzy Kendall (looking a lot like Susan George) and some pretty weird characters. The violence is pretty explicit, but kind of tame for giallos. And there's very little nudity. This is a pretty good rainy Sunday afternoon movie. Worth a look."
4,NOT THE BEST SOUND QUALITY,"Great cd but a crude recording, father & son do a great job together. The song selection is great, but it is still worth buying even with the medium sound quality. It is good enough to overlook the sound quality."
2,"Only Get The MP3 Download, NOT the CD Set","The Joyous, Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries sound like they were recorded from a scratched up vinyl record, every other word in songs at points has a scratch or click, its runs you crazy after awhile. I didn't see any bad reviews on this out of 27 reviews, so I thought that maybe this one set was somehow flawed and so I bought another, and the same problem. So I contacted Amazon and they gave me a promotional consideration for the MP3 download and the quality on the download is perfectly nice. The voices on this Rosary are so beautiful that I give 5 stars, it makes me weep its so beautiful, but 5 stars only on the MP3 download. If you love the Rosary as I do, you have to get this because it is beautiful beyond belief, angelic, heavenly, and far nicer than any other I've heard."
2,Recites Rosary too fast!,"This CD is fine in terms of the audio, but the Rosary is said too fast for me to pray along with it. I'm older, so maybe I'm just too slow, but I will look for another Rosary CD in which the speaker talks slower."
4,Recited rosary- did not like the ah-men,"The recited rosary was easy to follow and had some scripture and some short hyms in between. It also used the ""Oh my Jesus, forgive us our sins"" verse between mysteries BUT the reciters used the term Ah-men (episcopal)- not the tradition A-men that Catholics use. It took me a while to get over that - and I considered returning it for that reason. The CATHOLIC rosary should use A-men. If I had known that a different version used A-men I would have purchased it instead."
1,The Complete Rosary incl. the Mysteries of light,it was listed as new and expected it to be package as such. the case was woren and not suitable for resale. Very disappointed.
3,The Complete Rosary,"I love the way this 2 disc set is done. I purchased the mp3 set and I wish I had gotten the cd set as the music is cut off abruptly at the end os the song. I just doesn't play out completely so it spoiles it just a bit. However, it is still very healing. If I had purchased the cd set I would rate it a five star. The mp3 is a 3 1/2."
1,Don't use kindle fire version,"Kindle Fire version does not group the mysteries properly. You'd get the Gloryous Intro followed by the Joyful 1st chaplet, then Sorrowful 2nd verse ecetra. More frustrating than prayerful having to stop every 3 minutes to try to find the next correct prayer. Actually thinking of asking for my money back. too bad to because the prayers themselves are fine. Sorry Amazon!"
2,Completely Flawed,"There is no bass on this recording. An eerie absense of bass. You can imagine why, on this new edition, because you hear an engineer before the band starts up saying ""Tell Chambers to stop fooling with his microphone"".The band is worth hearing and can be heard on other recordings from this year, including radio broadcasts, when bass was present."
2,España 82,"La verdad yo esperaba una mejor imagen de video ya que se trata de un DVD.Con esta compra lo que estas pagando no es calidad si no un recuerdo de lo que fue España '82. La imagen es borrosa, pero si lo que buscas es solo un recuerdo; Compralo."
1,"Horrible, mala grabación, mal sonido, malo todo","Verdaderamente si están haciendo un trabajo recopilatorio deberían de esforzarse un mas, la calidad de esa colección es pésima, no sirve, no tengo palabras para describir la basura de ese producto, la narración es aburrida y el narrador ni siquiera sabe de football, es increible que vendan porquerías así, y que las empaquen, la calidad de la imagen parece sacada de youtube, ni siquiera dan la coronación final. De escala de 1 a 100 yo le doy 0, hubiera gastado mi dinero en otra cosa. Y esto va para toda la coleccion de dvds."
1,"Thurston's ""Facts"" are Skewed","Interesting that a legit publisher wouldn't touch this shameless tome trying to justify the fact that crown land was stolen by Thurston's missionary grandpa, a grandpappy who knew being a publisher would help him brainwash the locals into thinking the Queen deserved to be unseated. Yep. And the present day Thurston, like his land grabbing ancestor, had to rely on the publishing arm of HIS kingdom to get this book in print. Think ""Mr. Smithers"" on THE SIMPSONS when you think of Thurston Twigg-Smith."
2,Disappointing,"I bought Thurston Twigg-Smith's book, ""Hawaiian Sovereignty: Do the Facts Matter?"" at one of the shops at the Honolulu International Airport. The book was basically the author trying to defend his ""great"" grandfather in case there is a class action lawsuit brought by Hawaiians and Hawaiian nationals against his grandfather's estate. It was like I was reading Emperor Hirohito and Tojo Hideki's version of history.A waste of my money and more importantly... my time. I want my money back. I also want the two days back that it took to read it."
4,Awesome folding knife!,"Very impressive knife! Mirror polished San Mai III blade is amazing. I wish it came without the 2 pocket clips, I'll never actually use them, but for looks I have them on both sides. Opening the blade with one thumb using the thumb studs is difficult for me. It comes with an aluminum case with neoprene padding inside, the padding is loose so I glued mine into the case with rubber cement. Cold Steel sells it for $500, I paid $300 through Amazon.com. Some web sites sell it for less, but you can't beat Amazon.com for quality and support."
3,"Not his best, don't you know.","Bartholomew Gill's latest Peter McGarr police procedural seems a wee bit strained. The plot has promise, a philandering member of the ""eel police"" is half of a double homicide, with a young, recently married co-worker sharing death's bed. Tim Tallon is the inn-keeper, and a childhood acquaintance of McGarr's; in fact, the playground bully. Hughie and Rut'ie are back to their old tricks. We have a whiff of the IRA. There are some ancient jokes told to polish the bona fides of raconteur Benny Carson. In all, the characters are going through the paces. Despite the tragedy you find it hard to muster sympathy. Despite the ""humor"" you find it hard to smile. Loose ends, gratuitous violence (in his mid-fifties, McGarr must prove he's still a tough guy), and an improbable ending by half. Gill has done an admirable job in keeping an ongoing series fresh and intersting, but he misses here."
3,Could be depressing for women,"The Death of an Irish Lover is a well-crafted mystery but reading it could prove to be a bit depressing for any woman over say, 35. In this mystery the hero, Peter McGarr, has a wife much younger, better looking, and wealthier than he is who simply adores him. The only other woman in the story the author casts as attractive to men is the younger, drug-addicted prostitute. All other women are unattractive by virtue of their age, desperation for a baby or desperation for a man or craziness. One of McGarr's employee's, Ruth, is supposedly so desperate for her ultra masculine co-worker Ward that she is willing to have his baby, live with him half time and share him with the mother of his other children! A good mystery but at the same time a male fantasy."
4,Another winner,"Another winner in the Peter McGarr series, which were written by American author, Mark McGarrity, until his untimely death last summer. The characters are well rounded, never stereotyped, and the endings never easy to predict.There are enough false leads to keep you guesing until the end. As always we get a picture of Ireland, from the small town gossips to the dark underbelly of the criminal world. McGarr and his cohorts are interesting characters despite their all too human frailties. In a country where murders are refreshingly rare, McGarr keeps busy solving all that come his way. This book is a good read."
3,Leixleap doesn't leap,"Chief Superintendant McGarr is getting older, but he still manages to find an improbable situation in the village of Leixleap: a man with many lovers, possibly killed by one of them;gun running and eel poaching; a little hint of IRA involvement ... and so on. The plot and action are slow to start and then become cluttered with distracting side plots. Unfortunately, this does not live up to the fine earlier novels, such as ""Death of an Irish Sea Wolf"", ""Death of an Irish Tinker"" or ""Death on a Cold, Wild River""."
4,A good muse,"When wondering what to eat, and sick of the usuals, this book consistently stirs the imagination just by flipping through the pages. I often find myself ambling through my cookbooks looking for a good, fresh recipe. Well, this book is usually the one providing the good ideas, so I find it very nice to have around.The meals are usually simple but very tasty. While beautifully laid out and accompanied by accurate, warmly-lit pictures, the instructions do assume some familiarity in the kitchen. Though while this isn't Betty Crocker's Kitchen Basics, often times the techniques required aren't a stretch for anyone casually aquainted with their tools.I think this book is especially great for anyone developing their kitchen skills, and looking to add some creativity to their routine. The combinations of ingredients are fun, fresh, and will make you feel like you're making something delicious and special. All the better when it turns out that way. ;)"
3,Not as good as version 1 in this series,"This is by the same group who did the wonderful & engaging Early American Choral Music 1. Somehow this CD did not live up to its predecessor in some ways. The performance is still top notch, but somehow the CD as a whole isn't quite as engaging to listen to as the first. Perhaps version 2's strength is also its weakness. Its diversity of composers allows you to pear past the shadow of William Billings and sample other notable early American hymn writers. That exposure is valuable & appreciated. I just couldn't get into it as much.A final note: many of the texts are beautiful (and available from the publisher's web site). However, I would criticize ""Who is this that cometh from Edom?"" as dwelling just a bit too much on the Jews' rejection of Jesus. Among other reasons & issues, Christianity says that we are all sinners & there is no cause to single a particular group out negatively."
5,Changed the way I think about human behavior,"I read this book in my last semester as a psych major. I was extremely dissapointed with all the theories that I had learned relating to human behavior, until I read this book. This book provides explantions for humnan behavior, that in my opnion, are the ""real thing"". All the ariticles are well written and based on sound, scientific research. It is not easy reading, but it is well worth it. I think that anyone studying or interested in human behavior should read this book."
4,"More Tooby & Cosmides, please","I was prompted to respond by the review from the individual in Virginia. He or she didn't like the Tooby & Cosmides chapters whereas I feel they were by far the most interesting chapters in the book. Reading their long essay (Chapter 2)is one of the best favors psychologists can do for themselves. Being a psychology major, I know that I was often confused about psychology before reading it, but their combination of cognitive psychology with evolutionary biology finally gave me an idea of where psychology should be going in the future. If only social psychologists and domain-general cognitive psychologists would read it, their research and approach might not be so sterile and boring. My only regret is that the book contained some chapters that were not as strong as the early chapters, but the importance of the good chapters greatly outweighs any weaknesses in the other ones."
5,"Lionel, a good legacy but not the quality","I thought that this is an excellent book about the standard train company of the world called Lionel. I thought the book gave a good prospective of the company, but unbenonst to all, Lionel is not quality. If you want high quality railroading, you should look at a company called Mike's Train House and I think they should make a book about them. Overall, I would like to say, Happy 100th Birthday Lionel!"
4,Meyers advice,"Both men and women could stand to read this book. Given today's environment, we are all in need of managing our reactivity to others and our surroundings. Solid book."
3,Practical and easy to read,"Managing Your Emotions: Instead of Your Emotions Managing you is a very practical and easy to read book. I highly recommend the book to anyone looking for freedom in this area. If you're a ""high-feeler"" and tend to live life & make decisions based solely on how you feel...don't wait any longer, read the book!"
4,Managing your Emotions by Joyce Meyer,She gives specific information and life situations to relate as well as scripture to use relevant in changing your strongholds in this area.
1,Joyce versus Jesus,"A friend of mine gave me this book and I agreed to critique it for her.Meyer begins her book with the crux of her religious philosophy; ""I firmly believe that no person will ever walk in God's will and ultimately in victory if..."" The ""if"" here is the subject of whatever ""self-help"" nostrum Meyer happens to be selling -in this book's case it's ""if he takes counsel with his emotions."" (One sees evidence of Meyer's indifference to her followers, who are overwhelmingly women, in her use of the ""he"" in this sentence.)If all people who call themselves Christians would just put their faith in the atoning death of Christ as the source of their wholeness and salvation rather than in what they themselves do, they wouldn't be living a life of endless frustration and unhappiness and Joyce Meyer wouldn't be raking in millions from her deluded devotees, indulging her boundless greed in a life of luxury.She has her reward."
5,Great Movie,I saw this movie years ago and loved it. I found it again while searching for good things to add to my movie list. It was just as good as I remembered it.
4,Nice Romance,"This was a really nice romance. The acting was sometimes stilted, but overall it was really an enjoyable movie complete with the classic romance elements and characters. I wish they made more romance movies."
4,Alright,"I used this book at Cornell's school of Industrial and Labor Relations in an OB course. It was ok, but I have seen better. The examples are mostly revelant, but sometimes it strays from the covered material. A good book to use to review for the final exam, but if your teacher draws tests from their own lectures, make sure you utilize the index in the back!"
1,"Arrived Damaged and used, NOT NEW (as advertised)","I received this book and it had writing and the exercises are complete in the book. The listing was that this book was NEW, and clearly is not. The edges of the book were damaged (as if it were dropped many times. I am very disappointed that they would try to pass a very used book, as new. Buyers be warned."
4,Behavior in Organizations,"This book was required for my class which was very insightful reading.Lots of important facts and details. The book is easy to follow when it time to be test on your knowledge.Would I recommand this book for all Organizational Behavior classes? Yes, because the concepts and theories relate to real life situation and issues.The book demonstrate techniques used for effective communications in different organizations.Very enjoyable reading.AMG"
4,A Great Cure for the Blues,"Gene Harris is a master practitioner of the jazzy side of the blues. His piano playing is soulful and down to earth, but sophisticated and nuanced at the same time. Jack McDuff's ever-tasteful Hammond B3 adds a healthy dose of funk to the mix. These gentleman build their solos like master craftsman, while avoiding the cliches used by some of their peers. Guest vocalist Barbara Morrison shines on the title cut - if listening to her doesn't put a smile on her face, you better have someone check your pulse! This was a spirited outing for all who participated and that translates into great fun for the listener."
3,"Gene Harris and Jack McDuff - Down Home Blues (Concord Jazz, 1997)","Very few are the collaborations between Blues and jazz artists. The more so is valuable combined effort of jazz and soul great Gene Harris and acclaimed Blues pianist Brother Jack McDuff.Tunes which are distinguished by scholars and experts as jazzy and Blues, sound here very similar, probably not as jazzy as jazz fans would like and not as Bluesy as roots fans want to hear, they lay somewhere in the middle, album sounds as if there is no difference, and actually there was no difference one time, at the very beginning.Valuable reminder of where all it started from.Recorded at Capitol Studios, Los Angeles, California, December 11 & 12, 1996.Personnel: Gene Harris - piano; Jack McDuff - Hammond B-3 organ; Curtis Stigers, Niki Harris - vocals; Ron Eschete - guitar; Luther Hughes - bass; Paul Humphrey - drums.pastblues.com"
4,a pretty good cover up,"this is a mystery/adventure story. it is 1965 and beautiful monika beyer has just signed a $100,000.00contract to make films but,guess what? one day she simply vanishes but,not quite. monika has ""run off"" witha director named daran and they eloped to europe,maybe germany? it is the task of rick holman(who seemsto be a very savy detective)to find monika and bring her back,does he do it and what does he find along theway? i do not usually read mysteries but i ended up with several in my lap so...i liked this one. i kept trying tofigure out what,who,and why? it was rather complicated with a few people involved with deception in manyways and also several deaths in the book. it had a suitable ending. the title refers to a small film thatmonika was involved with before she vanished off the planet...(the girl from outer space...see the birth of anew star!!!.....)"
5,A Dutch Oven That's Worth its Weight,"This well constructed 6 quart Dutch Oven is perfect for every day home use. It's non-stick Calphalon finish is easy to clean, yet I can brown meats for long braising or stewing. It is also just the right weight, heavy enough to hold the heat and light enough to not remind you of the weights at the gymn. It was a terrific buy and certainly competes with Dutch ovens more than twice its economical price. I really like it."
5,Calphalon Dutch Oven,"Three years ago I was trying to find a heavy non-stick pan that had a finish that would not peel off. I needed it for boiling lots of different candy mixtures.I finally decided to go to Linens 'N Things close to my home town, knowing that it would be expensive, but I had been looking for several days and needed it NOW! I was shown this wonderful pot, and paid more than twice what I paid for this next one.This is the most awesome pot I have ever used, and I hope it never wears out.My daughter-in-law and I have started a small chocolate making business and having the 2 pots has certainly made things less time consuming. I am planning on ordering 2 more, since our product is really catching on.Received merchandise sooner than expected!!"
2,Not what I expected,I have two other pots of this same brand which I LOVE LOVE LOVE! This one was a huge let down. The pot is not even on bottom and spins on the stove rather than sitting flat. It also does not have the same weight as my other two pots which are both smaller. The handles are not stainless steel and I'm not surprised the previous reviewer had rust after a short time. What a let down.
3,Book of Lies,"It was not what I expected. It had one good article on the occult.It made me feel like I was on target. But the rest of a disappointment. Some good history, which I did like. If you are looking for confirmation about the occult, it does not have enough of that. Mostly opinions of others."
5,Amazonas from Amazon is Amazing!,"If you like Latin jazz or jazz piano, or really just about any kind of good music, this cd is for you. Manfredo Fest was an American treasure whose work is known and appreciated by far too few. I have all of his cd's and they are all wonderful!"
4,toaster,"If you are just toasting standard size toast or english muffins, the toaster is great. This is not a wide slot toaster! Some bagels are too thick for it and irregular size bread has to be cut to fit. I forgot that in my excitement to purchase this item. I had an older Krups wide slot--the kind with the glass tube- and it worked really well for all my toasting needs."
3,Not so hot if you already have the highlights,"I love Split Enz, but if you have Mental Notes, Beginning of the Enz, and their greatest hits you need not get this album unless you are a completist. Most of this is somewhat interesting (but inferior across the board to my mind) re-recordings of songs on Mental Notes and Beginning...""Sweet Dreams"" is an outstanding, touching song, and only appears here and on their greatest. ""Late Last Night"" also appears on their greatest. This version of ""Titus"" is on par with the original. ""Lovey Dovey"" has some cool twists on the original, but is too frenetic. ""Woman Who Loves You"" appears nowhere else (with its spoon solo to boot). The other four songs are wholly inferior to their Mental Notes/Beginning... versions, I think.Whereas the originals had a rootsy, jazzy feel to them, these are like processed versions, specially made to bring out the silliness at the expense of deeper feelings."
2,Here come the crickets,"If you like 45 minutes of crickets, this is the cd for you. The music and other animal sounds are decent, but the incessant crickets gets a little old."
4,Grilling Planks Great!,"These planks are wonderful and add much flavor to your cooking. Be sure you follow the directions and continually spray water during the cooking process. If you do not and the heat is high on the burners, the plank will start on fire.I have seen planks at grocery and warehouse clubs for a lot less, but not sure if the quality is the same."
2,loud and annoying,I bought this for Christmas for my daughter (11 months) thinking it would be good learning and fun for her. But its really loud and there is no way to adjust the sound level. Also to learn from she really needs to have someone with her to point out the objects Leaping Lily is counting. Overall a very durable toy but doesn't pack much of a punch for enjoyment or learning.
1,disappointed,"we loved the baby hug n learn tad, and bought this item for a birthday gift and was very disappointed. it doesnt light up like the baby tad. and the buttons are more difficult to press and it is not musical."
1,Not worth $30,Not happy at all with the quality of this item. I had one about 6 years ago and it was larger and better made. Im giving it as a Christmas gift and rather embarrassed.
1,Annoying!,"My husband and I bought this toy for our daughter when she was 1. As others have said, she had the baby Tad and loved it. She didn't really show much interest in Lily and my husband and I found her really annoying. We ended up taking it back and exchanging it for a less annoying toy."
4,Spanish Melody to Surely Get Stuck in Your Head,"I bought this when my niece was eight-months-old, and she loved it. I enjoyed the Spanish (rarely, if ever, played the English versions); my niece liked bopping along to the Spanish music. She is now one and still enjoys the melody but more as background while doing something else. Hopefully she is subliminally learning Spanish! (From reviews I have read, the older children seem to get bored with it...might be better for younger than the product claims.)"
3,Little disappointing Lily,"I found Lily to be a little disappointing. I was hoping that it would be more interactive for my daughter, as she thrives on things like that. But she has not and has not played with her for about 2 weeks. You give her a hug when she asks, and she says soemthing different. She doesn't guide you to find the flowers or balloons, she just starts counting. No colors or shapes. Was disappointed.."
3,Lily's OK,"She's nothing to write home about. I would like her more if she actually counted in order instead of jumping all around with her numbers. She speaks English and Spanish, so that's a neat feature. Baby gets bored with her rather quickly."
2,barly,"Basicaly a sex position book and nothing that hasn't been publishid 100 time before. Aside from a guide on how to please your partner there are some unfounded and completely false correlations to the shape of a person’s butt to their sex drive, a man’s lip fullness to the size of his penis and on and on. If what you are looking for is FACTUAL and helpful guidance in the bedroom look up Dr. Miriam Stoppard’s book The Magic of Sex. If your interest is strictly in reflexology, this is not the book you are looking for."
1,total waste of money...,"Sometimes you see a book cover and read the summary, and think you picked a good one, and only later find out you got suckered. I guess that's the risk one takes buying books online. Well ... I got suckered on this one. This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. It went in the trash 5 minutes after I received it.If you want a really good book on accupressure (packed with stuff that works), then check out another book I purchased called ""Accupressure for Lovers: Secrets of Touch for Increasing Intimacy""."
3,poor,I have the feeling this book has been more put out for comercial reasons using some taoist knowledge.It has a few good reflexology relations some good exercises specially the healing positions. The physical caracteristics and the sexual reflexology chapter is a bit poor in judgments that I do not believe being part of the taoist knowledge....
2,Quackery,See quackwatch.orgThen click on one of the MANY reflexology listings.This boils down to nothing more than superstition. Avoid.
1,Oh Good Grief!!!!,"There is no SHORTAGE of black men or white men or any other men! What there has always been a shortage of is single, handsome multi-millionares!Black men are no more screwed up than any other men. If you think that dating interracially will solve your problems, you need to think again. Relationships are difficult PERIOD.I am so glad I got this book second hand! Don't waste your money. Save it. In fact, spend it on taking a decent black man, who WILL give good foreplay and oral play out to lunch."
5,As Good As Any,"The bottom line on this book is it is aimed at black women who are interested, intrigued, curious, have thought about, are not opposed to dating outside their race: white men in particular. As a black woman, I think it is as good as any in getting at the heart of many of the issues and concerns that typically plague black women in the search for companionship and fulfilment. As someone else mentioned, he deals with issues like history, and black women's self-defeating insecurites etc. It's as good as anything out there in helping you make this decison about crossing the color line without feeling guilt or any such thing. It's time, black women, and you'll appreciate White's candor and understanding of the issues. A few of the critics of White are black men (some pretending to be other things). That's understandable. Read his book and you'll see how to deal with this sort of opposition to assertion of your free will."
1,This cannot be for real.,"I am a black woman who happens to be dating a white man. However, when I first came across this book a few years ago, I was offended and frankly, shocked that something this blatantly racist and disrespectful could have been printed under the guise of a self-help book. Whoever the author may be, s/he must realise that the way to make a rational argument to the intended reading audience of black females is NOT to insult black men, who represent her brothers, her father or her friends. Another review on this board took the words right out of my mouth, when it stated that historically, it has been white-not black men-who have perpetuated the myth of the black [...], and who have been heavily invested in creating a sexually degraded image of the black woman in order to justify his sexual exploitation of her. Half of me believes [or wants to believe] that this book is actually a satire. I hope one day to have my hopes confirmed!!"
1,Sorry excuse for a book.,"I'm a white man that is interested in dating black women.However, I don't want a black woman that dresses differentto attract white men. I want a black women and not a whitewomen with darker skin. And to hate and be negitive of blackmen is also moronic.Wortless book! Save your money and go buy a DVD or somethingas you will be much better off than reading this rubbish."
1,A Pile of Racist Anti-Black Male Propaganda,"As a White male who has dated women from other races, I found this book to be one of the most racist anti-African-American male pieces of trash that I've ever read. The author's obvious lust for Black females has tainted whatever good intentions he had for writing this book. The main theme of this book seems to be: ""Attention Black women: Black men (sons, uncles, friends, classmates, etc included? ) are rotten, obsolete and dangerous. Let them perish! To Hell with Black men."" The author needs to re-examine his true feelings toward African-American people. This book is pure racist garbage. I agree with ZB from NY. People like this should make any true American puke."
1,bs,"this is BS! If u like someone go and get with them, you shouldn't have to read a book to know how to date them. You'd swear white men were a different species. I'm sick of all this racist crap about white women and black men. You can't be generalised by race. It's stupid, this book has no point!"
1,Low rating because....,"I am a woman who chats frequently in a chatroom on Yahoo! for black women and white men. About once a month, someone comes into this room, claiming to be the author of this book. He comes into the chatroom, is very disrespectful of the people in it, and pushing his book. If this person is indeed the person who wrote the book, I would never read anything he's written. If not, the author of this book should be very upset that he's being represented in such a negative and derrogatory manner."
5,Groundbreaking!,"As a Black woman, it wasn't until I wasin college that I started acceptingWhite men into my lovelife, and my bed.When I opened my mind to the possibilityof interracial romance, I was shocked tofind that there were many attractive,willing, and successful White men whowanted me romantically, and sexually.I realized that White men value andrespect my opinions, and desire my body.Black men used to treat me like they weredoing me a favor by dating me, instead ofa White woman. Now, I have found happinesswith White men. If you open your mind tothe interracial possibilites, you will findno shortage of White men in your lovelife,and your bed. This book came after the fact,but it should be required reading for all Blackwomen. Open your mind, and you will find happiness.This book will just help you find out how."
3,"XPRO 36"" x 36"" Studio Photography Photo Light Tent - DigiTent - Dome - Cube - Box + 4 Chroma Key Back Drop","Lights and tent provide the right effect without trying although the chroma key background is not true ""chroma key"" for easier photo editing.Recommend buying the tent and lights, but forego on the backgrounds."
2,Poor quality!,"The light tent arrived in the following condition: zipper tearing apart from the outer bag, the zipper pull unusable (as there is no stop for the zipper pull), the seams of the light tent were coming apart, and the white backgrounds were slightly dirty. This was definitely not what I expected for the price I paid.The light tent is very large and thus is ideal for the floor or a large table top.Pro: the light tent was shipped very quickly.I am going to try to return this item to the seller."
4,Photocube works well,"Works well, a little hard to put my own backdrop in since I did not want to use the ones that came with it."
3,"""Seven Blood Stained Orchids"".... 1972","plot outline:A killer responsible for a series of brutal murders leaves behind some telltale hints that he plans to carry out seven ritualistic slayings. Evidence at the scene, in the form of a few half-moon lockets, leads police to a young innocent named Mario.As Mario and a beautiful young woman named Giulia try to solve the killings themselves, they realize that the killer seems to anticipate their every move."
3,Wesh stick chairs,"John Brown gives an excellent introduction on the history of Welsh stick chairs. He also expounds at length on the merits of handcrafed versus machine made products, and gives credit to past practioners in the art of making stick chairs. The book falls short on detailed explanations of making a stick chair. For that one should read Drew Langsner's The Chairmaker's Workshop. The two complement one another. Ernie Kleinman. Kleinman Guitars and Violins"
3,Only for the hardcore Sabbath fan.,"This DVD is a repackaging of a rare Japanese laserdisc called ""Careful with that Axe"". It is a great sit down interview with Tony Iommi circa 1991. However, this DVD is a poor transfer. It looks like it was mastered off of VHS and offers no special options. Even chapter selections are unavailable. Included are previews for other releases from other bands from this company. Expect no rare Sabbath proformance footage as there is almost none.If you're a hardcore fan, you will really enjoy this disc. However, expect a cheap package. I'd give it 5 stars, but the cheezy presentation knocks it down to 3."
4,tastes just like spearmint,"I bought this and got 6 boxes with 16 tea bags in each box. Lasted me quite a while. Every morning I would steep two bags in a mug of hot water for 10-15 minutes and then drink. I liked it sometimes with a little honey.I liked this product and will definitely buy again. For the reviewer who received just one box, you need to contact customer service there seems to have been a mistake."
4,could not find in stores,Bought this through Amazon because I could not find spearmint in local stores. Came in on time and good quality
1,Frighteningly Bad!,"While I know that each performer is wonderful, what possessed them to think that any good could come from attempting to sing the songs that Ella and Louis did. Comparisons are inevitable in such an effort and these guys do not come close to even the rare mediocre results that Ella and Louis occasionally produced. I kept trying to get through the CD but could not. Stick to what you do best not what others have already done better than anyone past, present and probably future."
2,Not what I thought I was ordering!,"Be careful! These dotted bongo bags are not what you think they are! They are shiny, see-through plastic that have a cheap chemical smell. I thought these were nylon, just like the solid-colored ones. But they are vinyl. Returning them immediately!"
1,Not too Bright,"Perhaps it is just me but nothing makes me crazier then a lady who doesn't have any common sense and walks around making things worse time she tried to help. Set in Medieval Scotland time of arranged marriages and marrying to increase ones clan, or protect it, Scottish bride is just that, two very far fetched lovers thrown together to save a clan and prevent a war. Lillias McGinnis our leading lady seems to put her foot in it at every turn and Iain McLeod our hero after a nine year absence seems unable to see it coming. I found the story slow and too far fetched. Not to mention the number of times I became embarassed to be female."
4,"Very good electroclash album but not quite ""classic"" - 4.5 stars","Every track on Cut Copy's ""Bright Like Neon Love"" is incredily catchy and mostly memorable which is pretty commendable. The only problem with it is that it lacks interesting subject matter or instrumentation (a lot of the songs are simply short phrases or sentences that he repeats over and over again, most notably on ""Time Stands Still""). He also dabbles a little bit into experimental and dreamy soundscapes but not so much that it's very noticable or distracting. His voice is actually pretty soothing, too - after a while it gets you tired (in a good way). I couldn't possibly call it a classic but I do think, however, that it's one of the best albums of 2004. If you're a fan of electroclash you'll no doubt love this album!Highlights include:the whole album!"
4,Daft 80's dance rock magic-,My favorite record(original artist) this summer; imagine a mixture of Daft Punk with a Human League/Depeche Mode type affair with some nice lyrics and guitar licks to keep it fresh and new without sounding like rehashed electroclash(not to say that it is all bad) + you've got a great summer record you can dance too and will most assuredly will hear in the club(maybe remixed). I believe one of the producers is Phillipe Zdar of Cassius; but all of the production holds up to make it a complete album w/ some rock gusto.
4,Likeable 80's synthpop,"Tuneful songwriting set to 80's synthpop backdrop. Good stuff, entertaining and listenable. Favorite song on cd is Future. Highly recommend checking out their In Ghost Colours album which is my personal favorite CC album."
3,Not as impressed as I was after hearing a few songs on [...],"I bought this after hearing zap zap and a few other tracks on Pandora, at which time I was blown away by the uniqueness and catchy nature of their sound. It was like Daft Punk crossed with Hall and Oates (that is th best description I can think of at the moment). But on an album, this fails to keep my interest for very long. The cover art is excellent however. So I still like the way this looks on my desk. I do not like the poor mixing job on this recording either. The bass is not exactly well defined or pronounced on this collection of songs. I was expecting it to make my entire car vibrate and shake the paint off. Not so. It barely engaged the subwoofer at all compared to other dance artists."
2,"If the books is called ""The Moscow Option""...","...then why do we spend the majority of the book everywhere but the Eastern Front?I won't deny or disparage the actions in the Pacific and the role of the British, but if a book is supposed to be about the German war in Russia, perhaps it would do well to spend some time in that setting.Instead, we get exceptional detail regarding British actions in North Africa, followed by hour-by-hour reworkings of American actions in the Pacific - and then we get sweeping generalities regarding the German actions in Russia.The premise and title of the book are largely sidelined, as if they are of secondary importance. Why?In this case, don't judge a book neither by its cover, nor by the synopsis printed thereupon."
3,The Moscow Option.....What are the options?,This novel was extremely slow at the outset but picked up steam as it went along. It's very well thought out and logically presented. For an alternative history junkie like me it was worth the read.The only slight negative would be seeing a little more character development by the author (especially of the more notable figures) would have been nice.
2,Pointless Exercise in Speculation,"Occassionally one comes across a book which makes the reader wonder, why did the author bother? This is a book in point. I can see no earthly purpose that this book serves. The premise is what might have happened had the Nazis taken Moscow? The rest of the 200 pages is pure conjecture that makes no logical sense. Just because the Nazis successfully capture Moscow has no causal relationship to this book's fictive account of the Japanese attacking Los Angeles or the Panama Canal. Just because Moscow falls does not have any particular causal effect which would have put the Nazis three miles from Jerusalem. I found the book irritating, annoying, without any particualrly defensible premise, and a lousy piece of historical fiction. Good fiction gives voice to people who had none, and fills in voids which historical research can not fill. This tripe does neither."
1,unhistoric,"my regret with this book is the fact that it doesn't explore really the OKH suggestion of august 1941 : in fact from the beggining ,downing is in the realm of fantasy .he doesn't explore the real opérationnal okh project and his real consequences ; he write too much about pacific and middle east and too little about russia ( why The moscow option in the case ? ) and he try to write 13 month of alternate history : these book is more a novel and has nothing to do with history.in my view : a bad investissement."
4,Hot and Spicy,"Similar to Taormino's ""Best Lesbian Erotica"" series, this promises the hottest lesbian erotica in print. It doesn't disappoint, with a toe-curling selection of smutty tales from new and established authors."
3,Sold 2 copie's!! BUT WHO GIVE's A FUKK??!!,"The follow up to one of THE best alubm's ever ''CORONER's OFFICE'', of course this is not as good, but I think that was the point, if you can take a joke, this would be for you!!!!TOTAL SABBATH WORSHIP!!!!! A GUITAR TONE THAT THE SMELLIEST SEWER's IN THE WORLD CANT COMPETE WITH!! check that huge riff in ''TERMINUS''!!One of the most bizarre album's ever made, that is for sure!!'''WERE's UNCLE WALLY''''PHONY BALDNESS CURE's''"
2,Not a great book for coeliacs,I found this book of little use for my 9 year old coeliac son. very little information about coeliac disease
3,not exactly what I was looking for,"It's full of tasty looking recipes, but the foods I have had to eliminate from my diet aren't the most common. It's unfortuante not being able to choose much from the book of what to eat when you can't eat anything!It's interesting reading about the authors' story and their tips on leading a green life."
1,Claptrap,Much ado about nothing. There was an article in Wired Magazine that covered this ground about 10 years ago. I choked this thing down hoping to come up with some gem: to no avail.Don't waste you time.
1,Do not waste your money,"Great hype, but the guts of this book could be compacted into 3-4 pages. It's amazing that someone can inject a blatant liberal slant into what should be an entirely apolitical subject. The author strays from the subject, makes rudimentary points by droning on with silly examples. Its called fluff and filler. This is one of the few books I have read in my life in which I took away vitually nothing. You would learn more taking the money and using it to buy a video on various strategies for changing light bulbs."
2,Far from fascinating,"Ahhhhhh, I truly expected to read something fascinating...I was wrong. The book is ok, few chapters were ok+, but nothing more!* The ""Stickiness Factor"" was mentioned A LOT! Ok, I got the point, move on...* There might be a tipping point to any business or idea but a design is not the solution (lock in most cases).* The book provides good example of why things were tipped over other but certainly not how to tipped.Someone said: ""Basic cause-and-effect"" I agree.Bottom line: 2 stars"
2,Lots of data,There was so much data and it seemed so varied. I lost interest 75% of the way through. I do recommend reading the section on Sesame Street and blue's Clues...that was really interesting.
5,Give it a chance and it might change your life,"This book could be life-changing if you apply a lot of it to your life. Some of it may seem a bit stretched, almost like a really good conspiracy theory, but I think if you have a little faith in it and give it a chance, that would tip things over. Useful for everything from social situations to business to communications since we could all use either a little more influence and/or the benefits of a little more influence for any number of reasons, from power to money to prestige, etc. Also helps you make a bit more sense of society and the world, in general."
3,"Interesting, but...","I read this while traveling, and was able to absorb Gladwell's viewpoint despite airports and hotels and the general on-the-road melee. However, while the theories and case studies Gladwell presents are fascinating, he fails to demonstrate the practical applications of his assertions. His Afterword makes clear that some of his readers have gone on to apply his approach in various ways, but it is their ingenuity and not any ""on the ground"" practical insight from Gladwell that is the cause. It will be interesting to note if his positions notably influence any policymakers, of if the world in general, despite his bestseller status, continues with its status quo mindset. No doubt if that is the case, Gladwell will enlighten us with a book about the reasons for that phenomenon too. It will be interesting reading."
3,inspirational but not for me,"I appreciate this book for what it is, but I found myself skipping paragraphs to find the point of all the parables. I think many would find this book inspirational if starting a business or in a marketing rut. But I just couldn't finish it - possibly due to a short attention span or time constraints."
2,How self-promotion and excessive behavior start trends,"A book about word-of-mouth and how trends get started? Within the tasteful cover and generously-spaced type, is a sophomoric analysis of social dynamics and their possible influences on generating critical mass.Praised by so-called literary elite, the book's authoritive prose gives merit to a 'certain point of view' about social behaviour and overall trends. Beneath the fluff is simply an exercise in book publishing and maximizing profit. Save your shekels."
2,Not for me,"I just could not get into this book. I found it to be a dry and difficult read, jumping all over the place and lingering on points that needed only a few sentences or paragraphs. Other people might enjoy this book, but it was not for me."
2,Very Mediocre,The data here seems to be a rehash of already discussed items in other publications. I found it dull and repetitive.
2,Not worth it,This book runs all over the place. It seems like Mr. Gladwell did not have enough info to make a full-length book so he just kept going over the same suff. Thoughts come and go without warning. The book rambles and was overall boring. Read Freakonomics by Levitt instead of Tipping Point.
3,"Interesting, yes... useful, maybe","It's been a few months since I started, but I have finally completed this book. My main motivation for reading it was because Kevin Rose, founder of Digg said it was in is top 5 of all time.I'll say it was an interesting read. It makes you think about the affects of little things. I won't say that I was particularly surprised by any of the data presented.While it was interesting and made me think, I still don't think it was a life-changer or anything. Yes, I would recommend reading it. No, it wasn't my favorite."
2,overrated,"I don't understand the hype about this book. He states very obvious facts clothing them in fancy buzz words. Also, it is annoying that he repeats the same (not very good) examples over and over to prove his point e.g. the hush puppies, paul revere etc. enough already, we got the point the first time you stated it, and it was not a very good point to begin with!I gave it two stars, since it was good in parts, some concepts like the connectors, external factors affecting trends and events etc. were interesting. but one gets the feeling that none of his ideas are his own, just culled together from various articles and research studies into a shiny marketing package and a catchy title to fool readers into thinking a brand new concept has been created."
2,Read the New Yorker article instead,"Superfically intriguing ideas, better and more concisely (and concretely) expressed in Gladwell's original New Yorker article -- as well as in (heaven forfend) the decade-old academic articles upon which Gladwell's book is based. The book feels stretched, like an article press-ganged into a book by a large advance.As for the ideas themselves ... well, let's just say that pop sociology is like Japanese food -- good fun, but leaves you hungry for something more substantial shortly thereafter. Put another way, connectors and the rest are interesting ideas, but to the extent that they are empirically demonstrable, these are old ideas; and to the extent that some of the things Gladwell talks about are new, they are largely untestable."
3,His Paul Revere Story makes his claims suspects,"The book Claims that people listned to Paul Revere because he was of the right personality for people to listen. But in truth we now about Revere's ride because of the poem. Revere left Boston around 10 PM. Along the road to Lexington, he warned residents that ""the British are coming!"" He arrived in Lexington around midnight riding a borrowed horse. At 1 AM, Revere, William Dawes, and Dr. Samuel Prescott left for Concord. Revere was captured. Only Prescott got through to Concord.So the people of lexington listend because he was the only one riding at the time. The people of Concord didn't listen becuse he never made it.So that makes me question the premise of the book. It may be well written but as far as for the contents ????? what else is misintepreted.Read it for entertaiment not any scientific or profound meaning."
3,"Good starting point for research, but the book is juvenile","The most facinating thing about this book is the references to social research studies that have been done through the decades. Much that I had never heard of, the bibliography is a good reference. The book itself however is written too plainly and comes off mostly as a boring read, other than the direct facts from research studies. The book keeps reading as if it's filler, like a high school student filling up a research paper because it has a certain page length requirement to meet. The revelations of the book are intriguing, but I would have liked a more substantial read, with more facts and specific results, the reduction of facts Gladwell tries to reveal are too watered down, obviously life is much more complicated that the conclusions let on."
4,Well worth the read,"Most books of this type can have their main theories wrapped up in two or three pages, and spend endless chapters ""selling"" a book you've already bought. Gladwell's premises, however, are not just ""bumper sticker"" ideas, they are carefully crafted and their limitations are detailed as well. I don't really think of it as a marketing kind of book; more like Social Philosphy. His case studies are compelling, and while some may seem obvious, it is nice to see ""something you always knew"" described in such a comprehensive way. After reading the book, I came away with the feeling that we can change things for the better; that a small push in the right direction might do a lot of good."
4,We have a chance,"While technology continues it's upward spirle, our over all quality of life seems to continually spin downward. World War III seems to have disappeared, but racial and ethical conflict have continued to destroy the concept of world wide peace. What success can be produced in the war on drugs? Where is there hope for family love? This book gives evidence that social change can be engineered. With a little effort, the impossible becomes a reality. Let's hope our real leaders use this information to give hope for our children and grandchildren of living in a better world. Not one where the rich have better toys."
2,Lacking Real Substance,"The Tipping Point was a word-of-mouth referral. Once the concept of the three influencers, salesmen, mavens and connectors have been explained, which is right at the beginning of the book, there remains very little of substance.The bulk of the book goes on and on, ad nauseum, with anecdotes which are somehow supposed to demonstrate the concept of a Tipping Point. I get it, I know what a tipping point is, as do most of the readers.What I don't get, and the reason most people buy the book I suspect, is how to create such a tipping point. You will find nothing on this point.Frankly this book reminds me of one of those motivational speakers that has come up with three fancy ex post metaphors, weaves it into a presentation and then tries to get us all to buy the ""new way of doing things."" I found it a total waste of time and money."
3,Good in parts but some chapters are better than others,"I bought this book as it was recommended by a friend who said that it was full of some revolutionary ideas on viral marketing. However, I don't think they could have read it cover to cover and only really read about Hush Puppies becoming the latest fashion trend in the US. I did enjoy the book in parts and it certainly had some great anecdotes about how it is often the smallest things that can have the greatest effect on the success of a social project or marketing campaign. Such as how mending broken windows in New York and arresting everyone who committed an offence on their subway began to lead to drastic reduction in crime in the city. However, I found some of the chapters on Sesame Street and Blues Clues dragged on and laboured the point.In brief the book is good, but some chapters are better than others. If you take the time to read it you will learn something about how the human mind can be tipped by the smallest detail."
3,Stats that back up common sense,"Although I really enjoyed reading this book and the fun stats in it on reflection I find myself thinking I wasted my time. The book does a good job of pointing out there is always a ""tipping point"" to anything in life that becomes popluar. And when it does people can go back a look at when it happened - the Oprah show, QVC, People Mag, etc. Although this is always true the author does not give a clear cut way to get your idea / product / mission to the tipping point - there is no 10 point plan.In the end each person is left their own common sense to decide what to do to make their idea work."
3,"""Blink"" is better.....","Meh, it is an okay book. I've read much better. A lot of useless information. I feel that the core information of this book could be presented in about half of the length that it is at.I read ""Blink"" first and I thought it was descent so I decided to read this one hoping in would be awesome...... oh well.""Darwin's Black Box"" Greatest book ever!!!!!"
3,"Intriguing, but don't buy into the impact of parenting","I've read a number of Malcolm Gladwell's books and they are fascinating - they really force you to think differently. The Tipping Point was no exception in that regard.There is one point he makes in the book, however, which I definitely cannot buy into - he claims that kids are far more impacted by their peer group than their parents. He further claims that parenting has very little impact on the ""outcome"" of the child.My personal experience (25 years of parenting) and years of observation of other families and their kids tells me otherwise. In fact good parenting by definition involves keeping an eye on the peer group!!Christine Brown-QuinnAuthor of Step Aside Super Woman, Co-Founder of Women in Business Superseries"
2,Shudda been an HBR piece,"Obviously there was/is a lot of hype around this book, so I had very high expectations. I found the premise interesting, but the science isn't there, at least to an extent that warrants all these pages. Thus, the author just seemed to keep repeating himself. I gave up halfway through out of boredom. Good idea for a Harvard Business Review article - just not a 291 page book."
5,An excellent and inspiring read!,"Malcolm Gladwell at his best - This is how marketing books should be written - not just marketing products, but ideas, thoughts, anything - if you have something you wish to share with the whole world, I suggest this is how you go about doing it. Gladwell's three main factors of how and why an idea catches on are spot-on. He also tries well to explain how to harness these factors. I won't say much more, no spoilers!A must read, even if you are not in marketing."
4,Mesmerizing,So well written than you seriously get lost in the words. Not a big fan of non fiction writing but Gladwell delivers and I receive!
3,Great concept but Not Structured,"I found the book difficult to follow in term of structure. The author uses numbers as subtitles and in each numbered section he would tell 2 or 3 stories. It would be much better if there was a label for each story or subtitle at least.However, The concept is great, I learned a lot from the book. Yes he take things for granted as facts with no proves but thats fine with me because I like to analyse the ideas myself.I recommend buying Made to Stick for the Heth brothers to reinforce the concept of stickness Malcom is talking about"
4,Great Job!,I have really enjoyed reading this book so far. It has great insight on how the unexplainable things in life work.
4,Tipping Point is to the point,Very interesting book and one of the best for facts as well as some insight on human nature and the earth. Written in a way you can understand and by someone who knows what he taking about. I enjoyed and found a lot of interesting facts as well. Everyone interested in mother nature and past and present events of this world should read this.
4,Tip the Point,"The good thing about this book and Malcom Gladwell in general is the intelligent manner of portrayal. He is a very talented thinker, and to successfully put his thoughts into words is always fun for a reader. There were times when reading this book that I would sit and think of similar scenarios in my life that fall in line with what was being discussed, and I could always come up with a few. However, some of the deductive reasoning that Mr. Gladwell came up with was a little different than my train of thought. Not a fault of his, people are different.I enjoyed the numerous statistical backing for his claims, and also that there was a method to his endless list of examples. However, I did not like how repetitive this book became. Yes, the best way to learn and teach is through repitition, but I didn't need it. It at times felt like a sales pitch, and maybe it was....Good read. Would I reccommend? Yes, and I have."
3,so-so,"Nothing new introduced in this book. Do like the examples, but no new ideas, unfortunately. Would prefer something that has refreshing new ideas."
3,Okay book,"Okay book but focuses more on its examples than its concept. I think that I could have learned everything I needed to learn in an essay and saved myself the pain of going through the entire book. Love ebooks but darn it, why aren't the prices on par with print editions on older books."
1,Kindle,"It started out that you could buy kindle books for far less than the printed books. Now after buying the kindle; the printed books are cheaper; does,t make sense and I feel as though I have beed ripped off and should have stuck to printed books in the first place, at least you can lend them to people and sell them as second hand."
1,Utter BS,"Unfortunately I read his book 'Blink' and the bad review for 'The Tipping point' will not be sufficiently described how ""uselessness"" of his writing & bookS. I think Macolm Gladwell & Taleb Hassim (author of Black Swan) belong to same category of authors have no content but lot's of words & PR (or I call it utter BS)- Strongly suggest you flip it through in library or book store."
4,Opening Pandora's Box and Finding Success,"The Tipping Point is jam-packed with information about how to create your own landslide market. Although verbose in the extreme in some cases, Malcolm Gladwell makes his point...and then some. Excellent content for the would-be entrepreneur who hasn't taken the class in Business Ethics yet, he hits on the do's and don'ts of marketing tools. He states that we can affect the tipping point of our product; which causes an overnight (relative term) epidemic to explode by simply putting enough blocks on the proverbial scales to tip them in your favor, and then using proper ethics in sales to create a Fortune 500 company. This is wonderful information for the marketing strategist as well as the entrepreneur...well worth the read! He tells you how to open Pandora's Box, per se, and earn the gift of marketing genius! You've got nothing to lose, and EVERYTHING to gain!"
2,Boring,Sorry - but author just seemed to blather on and on - This was chosen for a book club selection. I could not get excited about reading this book so quit after the first half.
5,Inspired,I am a long time fan of Gladwell. This book is recommended reading for all of my university business ethics courses. When lecturing at community and corporate events it is a great resource for inspiring stories. It is a great reward to share something with people trying to improve their lives and especially work and see a light go on in their heads. Of course- I have to reference Mr. Gladwell's light.
1,Socio-babble,"For the most part, I found this work (like many in the field of sociology) to be a collection of convenient observations masking itself as real scientific work."
4,"Gladwell is king, but don't let's get too excited","I'm a huge admirer of Malcolm Gladwell's essays in the New Yorker and of this book. He's a master teacher and synthesizer of complex ideas and (seemingly) disparate trends. Tipping Point is fun to read and you'll learn a great deal from it. I'm shying away from 5 stars, however, because I don't believe there is as much practical application as fans have imagined (or wished) there was. The Tipping Point is more of a post-game wrap-up, showing how ideas, trends travel, but it isn't really going to teach you how to make your idea/product/self into the next big thing."
4,Great read,"This book is very interesting. If you wonder about cause and effect, this book explores the links between what makes information travel and why it doesn't through other means."
4,Accessible science for the layman!,"How do some things gain so much momentum, or such a sudden wave as to make a serious impact in our culture? How do some trends, fads, products, and ideas reach critical mass? Gladwell's thesis provides the answers. Deeper are the titles Six Degrees, Linked, and Sync--but Gladwell's pop culture treatment is an excellent primer."
2,Wishy washy non-science,"Don't waste both your time and or your money on ths poor read. While the book does point to trendsetters, it offers nothing new to the discussion. Mr. Malcom Gladwell's friend Jacob who introduced hm to all of his friends is not an example of the social lives of the rest of us. Junk science and a junk read."
5,A Tip To All: Read This Book,"I read The Tipping Point shortly after its release, and rarely does a day or two go by without my recommending it to somebody or using it as short-hand reference to the ways of the viral world---mavens, salesman and connectors that we are!Gladwell is a supremely gifted writer, and I highly recommend this book, particularly to anyone seeking to wield influence in one or more areas of their life."
5,This book will be the tipping point for not only your business but your life!!,"You will never see the marketing of your business the same again! You can apply tipping points to the marketing of your business or tipping points (turning points) in your life. This book forever changed the way I see the marketing of both of my businesses and my life. It also inspired me to write my own book and am working on the second due to what I learned from Malcolm in Tipping Point and Blink.Rebecca D. Turner author of ""Tattoo"" a business book, read it, grow your business, enjoy your life!!Tattoo"
4,Social Media Strategist - Must Read,A fascinating look at the societal and cultural factors that mark everyday life. It's three rules of epidemics are very appropriate for any marketing executive in today's highly competitive business climate. Particularly if you're involved in creating Social Media Marketing strategy.Good use of case studies such as Hush Puppies and Airwalk brands.
4,Tipping Point is no little thing,"Gladwell has a unique writing style that keeps you reading from start to finish. Erudite is the word that comes to mind. No one ever writes about the things that intrigue him, yet once you begin reading you become intrigued also. He's a master of trivia that is never trevial. I've read several of his books and look forward to more. If you read Tipping Point it will be a tipping point for you also."
3,Not As Good As the Others,"Although this was interesting, it wasn't nearly as fascinating as Gladwell's other books so far. I definitely recommend reading Outliers instead!"
4,A good solid read,"The subtleties and intricacies of human relations are illustrated (not scientifically explained) here through a careful detailing of successful and unsuccessful attempts to influence groups of people. Unlike many current affairs books, this one gets meatier and more engaging as it progresses. Professional communicators, managers and parents will benefit immediately from reading this. People may decry its obviousness or its common sense, but couldn't we use more common sense?"
2,Irrelevent Drivel,"Yet another author who has found something interesting to write about, realizes there isn't enough to fill a book and then embarks on a meandering journey of sleep inducing, page filling drivel. In this case the subject is social epidemics. If you wipe out three quaters of this book you'd have a good read."
5,A worthy read,"Definitely a book worth reading. A lot of research has gone into writing this book. Gives you a totally new perspective on how change happens from a small event. This book is for everyone - from a budding entrepreneur to an academician, from a successful enterprise to a failing industry, from a CEO of a multinational company to an average joe who is raising a child. I found the case-studies very insightful."
5,This book has reached the tipping point,"From Loren Keim, author ofHow to Sell Your Home in Any Market: 6 Reasons Why Your Home Isn't Selling... and What You Can Do to Fix Them:Clearly written thesis that describes how ""little things"" can make big impacts. Although there's been a lot of criticism of this book, I found it enjoyable, easily readable and highly interesting. I found it a fascinating look at human behavior."
3,An Author Shamelessly Setting Himself up for Success,"This book is, more or less, a gimmick. It will be the tipping-point that turns a rather unexceptional journalist into a marketing guru or consultant. All on account of a light read that glosses over phenomena inherent in human nature group-think psychology.I read it in a few hours which is merely indicative of its depth: not much."
2,Sesme Street and Marketing!,"I can't quite pin point the reason why I had to give up the book mid way. Maybe it was an overdose of this show called Sesme Street and its mind mapping techniques? or maybe just too marketing for me. The initial parts of the book gathers the interest of the reader and keeps you going.. and then it goes downhill from there when he gets into the details of cases and never tells you what pushed any situation to a 'tipping point'.Sivaji the boss, the new Rajinikant movie, would be a good example of a tipping point. No rationale. Just a mad loyal adoration.I have seen Malcom Gladwell speak in public and he is a darn good thinker..his analogies are good and he is quite obviously articulate. But I cant seem to figure out why maybe he didnt quite hit the 'tipping point' with me on this book. (maybe making me buy it was the tipping point ;)Anyway hope you have better luck with the book than I did."
3,I prefer Tipping Point,"Gladwell's Tipping Point gave me food for thought, but I was not convinced by the theories and case studies presented in this book. Blink starts off well but fizzles out."
2,"Ultimately, it was unsatisfying","Essentially, the author presents several interesting studies from the fields of sociology and psychology. He then attempts to magically weave them together into a kind of Unified Theory of group behavior. His assertions are suspect, not based on fact. ALso, many times his conclusions do not logically follow from his premises. They may be AN answer, but they are certainly not the ONLY answer.In the end, the author sees patterns where he wishes them to be. Consequently, he develops theories to explain these ""patterns"" and almost embarassingly attempts to explain the workings of the entire world."
3,Interesting idea but leaves you without a plan,I thought the book expresses an interesting idea but left me cold at the end because there is no 'how to do it' component to it. It's too vague. Sort of like reading about the probability of being killed by a meteor then not telling you what you can do to reduce your risk!
2,Scientific optimism,"For every major thing, you can go backwards and determine the little things that made it happen. This gives the reader a false impression that their meandering day-to-day lives have real impact in the world. Like the Butterfly Effect - will that butterfly you just saw create a monsoon in a few months on the other side of the world?Probably not! What the author fails to account for is that for every little thing that turns into a big thing, there are billions of little things that amounted to nothing.So, do you enjoy playing the lottery? If you do, you will enjoy this book. If you think playing the lottery is a waste of time and money, you probably will see the primary fundamental flaw in this work."
4,More interesting than enlightening,"There is a wealth of readable stories, as you might expect from a journalist, but the story-telling so dominates the theory (which is supposed to change the way we think) that even the Conclusions chapter starts with yet another story. Is the book (as suggested on the inside cover) `destined to change social paradigms and overturn conventional thinking'? Not if the Jerry Springer show gets there first. It's readable but not life-changing. If you hope that the book will help you to change the world you will find absolutely no examples of Gladwell's theories being tried by anyone, even himself. It is all retrospective analysis. And it doesn't, really, deserve to `tip'."
3,"Hear, hear!","Having heard the word ""tipping point"" around a thousand times in so many blogs, it's about time I read it. For starters, it looks promising that the book has reached what it deals with: tipping point, but, once you read it, it's a collection of cases that boil down to a couple of claims: <em>cool</em> is a self-fulfilling prophecy, and people react in unexpected ways. All in all, a good read, but a bit more of substance would have been welcome."
4,Awesome Premise With Possible Application,"Gladwell makes a great argument for cultural phenoms as viral epidemics but as a marketing expert I ask myself ""How can this be applied?"" and I feel that Gladwell doesn't fully answer that question.There is a certain comfort that one asking this question can take in that there are books out there that *DO* show how to create a viral response within the culture. ""POWER PERSUASION"" by Barron and Kaus being one of them.Now if I can combine these two books and tap into the latest pop-culture craze I'd be set for life.This one is are real mind bender when it comes to ""How can I apply this?"" but a great read."
5,Excellent ideas - Excellent read,"So many authors get a great idea for a book and think that excuses them from pouring equal energy into the writing, dooming otherwise great books to mediocrity. Gladwell avoids that trap in ""The Tipping Point"" by following his fascinating idea with storytelling and examples that make this as much of a page-turner as a lot of fiction novels.Gladwell describes the means by which concepts catch fire in a society and brings them to life with interesting and detailed examples that really capture your imagination and get you thinking about the possibilities inherent in the concept of the tipping point.Whether you are looking for a way to help your business or just enjoy a well-told story and the nuances of how societies function, this is an educational and fun book.Highly recommended."
2,Formula,"Malcolm Gladwell has a formula. Each book is based on one catch phrase and probably 2-3 page of serious material. Instead he beats the topic with a stick until he has enough material for a book. For a researcher he is not that great. If two things happen one after another, it does not mean that there is a cause effect relation. If many successful people have a common habit running through them, it does not mean that the habit is responsible for their success."
5,Insights into behavior for business,Malcolm does a suberb job outlining the many ways our environment and background affect how we view the world and our resulting behavior.Most important is how the fringe issues can have a profound impact on results and society.Many aha moments and real life examples to bring the issues home.A great read I'd highly recommend not only for marketing but for a general understanding of human behavior.
5,Better than every marketing book I have ever read,Mr. Gladwell book is very easy to read and it gives very good examples and descriptions of the basic of marketing. I totally enjoyed his examples. Before that I was wondering why they always show the Tele Tubbies two times. Now it is very clear to me.
5,A Book for the Real World,"The Tipping Point is one of those books that is so popular that it has generated its own vocabulary, and it is now not uncommon to hear people talk about tipping points when discussing trends and fads. Most books like this have a sort of hucksterish salesman's pitch quality to them, but this one is different. Gladwell approaches the topic of how things become popular and universal scientifically, and in the process you learn a lot more about the world you live in."
3,Overrated but still good read,"After all the marketing i read and heard about Tipping Point, I went out and bought like 4 of Malcolm Gladwell's books. To be honest, it was good, not great, and because his style is so monotone (even in writing) I still haven't read the rest of them I bought. If I just bought this one, I would have been happy :-)"
3,The Tipping Point,"While this book deftly showcases Gladwell's skills as a journalist and nascent recorder of ""tipping points"" - I definitely have read more instructive books in terms of marketing. I particularly liked Lois Kelly's ""Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-Mouth Marketing"" which truly shows companies how to have real conversations with customers and make meaning instead of buzz. I would at the very least say you should read both and see what the buzz is truly all about.Beyond Buzz: The Next Generation of Word-of-Mouth Marketing"
2,Disappointing,"I love Malcolm Gladwell's stories in the New Yorker, but found this book to be a big let-down. It's obvious, and seemed to have been written in a rush."
3,Why did crime REALLY fall in NYC in the 1990s?,"Read the first half of this book and the first chapter of Freakonomics, and you will still not know. Levitt claims it was increased abortions in low income families 20 years earlier. Gladwell claims it was simply a plan to remove grafitti from the subways. I always had heard that it was simply a result of the improved economy during the 90's, a 'myth' that both these books dispell with further myths. I am confused. Niether book provided a clear answer, just more questions."
1,Don't waste your time on this book,"I started into this book and made it about 1/3 of the way before I gave up. It's the same observation over and over for the entire book. It's not even a good observation. I don't understand how people even think this book was good. Save your money and get something else. I got bored after he points out the same thing for the millionth time. Had he done more research as to why this, ""tipping point"", occurs rather than just state that it does occur, the book would be better."
3,the benefits of hindsight,"As I write this, there are 740 reviews of this book. Well, here is one more.Read this book if you want to be mildly entertained by the anecdotes within. There are some stories that do have some interest.However, the book only gets three stars because it purports to be more than a collection of anecdotes. The Tipping Point is empty. It offers common sense and oft heard wisdom stated with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. As stated in other reviews, Gladwell works backwards to give his ideas credence. The ideas are without worth if trying to work forwards.The bottom line is, the book does not offer a framework for analyzing situations that has predictive value, as such, it offers very little value at all."
2,Tedious,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I found this book to be tedious to read and I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. There's a lot of talk about what I thought were pretty commonly understood concepts, but not practical application of how to make those concepts work in a business environment."
4,"Read, learn, discover",Malcolm Gladwell has the capacity to write in such clear and easy to follow language that it captures your attention from the very first page. The material presented is exiting and opens up your eyes about how little things can make a massive impact. Especially from a business perspective a book to read and learn from.
4,Interesting Read,"Interesting book. It may not change your life, but it certainly gives one something to think about. The concepts are clever and it is apparent Gladwell has done his research but it drags a little in parts. It was a break from the usual fiction that I read and I enjoyed it. I especially like his thought on nicotene addiction. I want to read Blink after reading this book as many of the reviewers of The Tipping Point have mentioned it is the better of the two."
3,"Interesting, but not profound","This book is worth reading. The ideas are fascinating and the writing fun. It's a good place to start thinking about some potentially powerful concepts. But in the end, nothing new here that has not appeared in basic texts on sociology, communication, and education."
5,Wow!,This book was one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a while. Gladwell's theories are a different way of thinking about trends and life as a whole. I would highly recommend this book!!
5,social relationships affect everything,The tipping point offers no guide on how to use the information inside. Its not about finding success or utilizing a proven system to market and control people. The stories and case studies included simply are what they are. This book proposes a central idea and shows over and over again the power of its intangible nature. If anything it should promote a spark of interest in your own mind about your place in society at large and identify the relationships you have that dictate the products you use and the decisions you make. I would give it an A+ for simply affecting my life beyond the confines of the pages and creating a new internal dialogue for myself.
2,"Repeat, repeat, repeat",I honestly threw this book out 50 pages in as it just keeps repeating the same stuff over and over. I feel like Gladwell made his point 10 pages in and kept repeating it with the same examples over and over. I honestly don't know how he filled up 200 pages. This is a 25 page book disguised as a much longer book. What a bore.
3,"It's ok, but a little repetitive","This book have some interesting insights and informations about the subject, but I noticed that it's a little repetitive trying to prove the points and show the idea. Maybe the whole theory could be developed and explained in half of the pages.It's an interesting reading. Not a life changing one though."
2,Redundant.,"He spoke about the same things over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. I mean, yeah the information was interesting but the repetitiveness of it all was mind numbing."
5,Eye Opener,"Malcolm Gladwell, sets one thinking on multiple concepts. Be it explaining the ""Power of Context"" or ""stickiness"", each of these are applicable in a real life situation. Marketing professionals, HR personnel, managers, entrepreneurs, advertisers, educationalists... there is something to take for each one.This is an abosulte ""out-of-the-box"" thinking. Must Read!"
5,The Peddling of Influence,"Gladwell has an astonishing talent for making thethorniest of arguments relevant and crystal-clear. I was particularly engrossed by his analysis of the word-of-mouth phenomenon--the way Connectors and Mavens and Salesmen direct the flow of ideas in society. If you want to understand how the world really works, this is a good place to start."
1,Mediocre thinking wins once again!,"Simplistic pop culture. Pseudo-science wrapped in the guise of profundity. A waste of time for any right thinking, concerned individual.I grow so weary of the AVALANCHE of trendy, pop-culture, pseudo-science books that is sweeping over the literary landscape today. Can someone please help me spell gobbily-gook?"
5,Outstanding book - excellent price,"This book was recommended by entrpreneurs like the founder of Under Armor, Kevin Plank. I suggest it be read in conjunction with Freakonomics, by Steven Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner."
5,can I put more than 5 stars?,"This was an intriguing book, packed with precice, soursed information. the author tends to go on rabbit trails, but clearly explains the reasoning for doing so. if you get confused or board, just stick thorough it and it will make sence. the first and last chapter alone are worth more than double the price of the whike book.a must read."
5,Real Page Turner,This book is absolutely great; you won't be able to put it down. Gives very interesting insights into social phenomenons. I highly recommend this book!
2,"A little boring, redundant if you've already read Blink...","I read Blink prior to reading The Tipping Point and found the Tipping Point to be somewhat repetitive, more slow-paced and less interesting than Blink. I think that if I had not read Blink before this book, I would have liked it. My overall opinion is that the two are too similar and that either by itself is interesting, but both together are not too interesting..."
4,"Entrepreneurs, heads up!","I liked this book very much. It describes a theory that explains how new trends and social behaviors are created and spread.The book gave me new marketing ideas and some insight on the making of social trends.So, if you're into creating something new that captures the hearts of thousands don't miss it. :)"
2,Shallow,"When reading reviews, I think it's important to take the reviewer's background into consideration. Having said that, I think the book was shallow but I have studied social psychology for years so many may or may not agree with me. Like other reviewers have noted, the book is more along the lines of a protracted magazine article rather than anything really substantial. It was a nice overview of some famous social experiments but I thought my head was going to explode after he repeatedly referenced Hushpuppies and extrapolated on STDs for the nth time. On the bright side, I was hoping for an interesting tidbit to investigate further for a dissertation topic and I found it when he mentioned Robin Dunbar's anthrolopogical studies on the social brain so I'm delving further into that now. Side note: the audio version uses a very dreary narrative voice (the author, I think) with a slight attitude."
1,Tiresome and Repetitive,"Tipping Point is a painful book to read, painful especially to contemplate the patchwork of fill that turns what at best is a pop magazine article into a poor excuse for a book. Gladwell stabs at any theme he can possibly use to support his by no means new theory of tipping points. He hits one, perhaps, when he covers Rudy Giuliani's results in the City of New York, buts the rest are paler attempts. His comparison of Paul Revere with Dawes is over-romantic and downright silly. There's something profoundly patronizing about his tone of writing and his lack of any kind of wit."
2,eh..,"Everyone said, ""YOU really have to read this!"" But, i was kind of bored with it from the few first pages. What i was recently so impressed with is Live Like A Fruit Fly - also available on amazon."
5,Worth Picking Up,"The book The Tipping Point is about how certain individuals can, directly and indirectly, affect and influence a mass group of people with the smallest amount of effort and in not so obvious ways.After reading The Tipping Point, I am beginning to think that Malcolm Gladwell is somewhat like a social scientist; he studies people. He doesn't seem to buy into social clichés, and his analysis tend to be insightful and quite helpful.Gladwell seems to have this special tone about him that allows you to trust him and feel you have known him for quite some time. This is a very good book and I would encourage everyone to read it.MM"
3,"Entertaining, but ultimately unsatisfying","The tipping point is well written and a fun read, but ultimately not very convincing. Many of the examples he gives are very entertaining and insightful, such as why Sesame Street and Blue's Clues were successful. Others, such as the derease in crime in New York City seem irrelevant to tipping points.In the end, most of what seems so amazing to Gladwell is plain old exponential growth. Things start slow and get bigger and bigger. The problem is there is no ""tipping point"" in exponential growth. Its like compound interest. The rate of increase stays the same but the rewards get huge in the end. Gladwell doesn't seem to understand this and arbitrarily picks a point along the growth curve and calls it the tipping point."
2,Highly overrated,"I heard the praise about this book and regret falling for the hype. I agree with the negative reviews below. The author's premise doesn't really add up, and he seems to make so many suppositions (none of which are supported by footnotes, and many of which seem like a stretch to me) that I just don't buy how he tries to piece it all together. This is not a great scientific study of this supposed cultural phenomenon, ""the tipping point,"" and I don't really buy into the practicality or reality of such a concept in the first place. Buy at your own risk. I did not like this book at all. I did, however, read his other book, ""Blink,"" and thought that was much more interesting and compelling. This book was just too implausible and is overrated."
3,Valuable concept in too many words,"The tipping point creates a valuable concept of the contageous potential of new ideas. The core concepts and the associated terminology could have been presented concisely in half the time. Too much history on the ""stickiness"" of Sesame Street bogged me down and nearly forced me to fast forward. In reviewing the tapes a second time to outline the key concepts, I skipped 80% of the monologue. More varied examples of fads, movements, and changes in conciousness would have been more valuable. I will reccommend this book to others who may seek to change the conciousness of any group, but skim and outline the operative concepts and absorb as much of the examples as needed to appreciate the message."
2,Gladwell 's point?,"What was Gladwell's point? I found the information in his book actually quite obvious and mundane. The study which the Danish scientist did is factually incorrect regarding HIV transmission occurring centuries ago and coming back to haunt us and that people actually get more venereal diseases when they sleep with bisexual men, promiscuous men in summer months, wow there is nothing new there.I was not terribly impressed I could give and exhaustive critique but I will pass."
2,Tippping Point,"After having read ""Blink"" which I found absolutely fasinating this book was a disappointment. For me, there was nothing new in the book that I had not discovered myself or read about previously and it wasn't a different perspective on how the public or society reacts; word of mouth or the power of knowing the right person to give the important message to such as Paul Revere getting the credit vs Dawes. As to that point there may be some historical inaccuracy and the conclusions that Gladwell made regarding why we know Revere and not Dawes are based on some assuptions that Gladwell made rather then a detailed study. What Gladwell is good at, is taking research that others have conducted and explaining it to the general public. This book was a bit too simple and basically a re-write of other people materials and a poor one at that."
4,Great read,"Insightful and inspiring. Really gets your head spinning about possible solutions to so many struggles that marketers face. This book is tough to categorize as it transcends disciplines. It clarifies for the reader what seem like otherwise unexplained circumstances and offers a great perspective on how little details really can bring about totally different outcomes. More specific examples and evidence would have been great. A true skeptic will find flaws in some of the conclusions as they may appear as mere coincidences, or unproven theories. Nevertheless, a great thinking book."
3,An easy read,"The tipping point was a very well written book. It was easy to understand the concepts the author wrote. He uses examples that are very effective with reinforcing his points. I believe this book would be best read by an individual who enjoys understanding how people and society react to each other. I do feel though the author was trying to write more than what was needed, almost as if the publisher had certain amount of pages needed for the book to be published. Some of the examples the author used were understood within the first couple of pages and yet the author decided to write more to drill the idea into your head. I would have much rather the author have made the final chapters called `Backup' for those readers who needed additional examples to understand the concepts."
4,Easy Reading,This is a wonderful book about how epidemics begin. The drop in NY Crime and the rise Hush Puppies sales have something in common. The author has given wonderful examples of how epidemics start and how they become epidemics. The flow from one chapter to another is commendable. It is a very easy read unlike many books in this category. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend this as a Sunday afternoon reading.
2,Avoid.,"Too much Sesame Street and why teenagers smoke. Off the cuff theories about mavens. Only interesting parts are repeating other people's ideas, eg ""broken windows"" theory, not that that or other parts of the book have anything to do with why fads catch on."
5,Very thought-provoking,"I know it has been said many times, but Malcolm Gladwell has a unique ability to give a new perspective to issues that seemingly have been analyzed many times before. This is another very interesting, thought-provoking read from Gladwell. If you are someone who likes to have your preconceived notions about old issues challenged, then I think you will really like the book. I especially liked the section on teenage smoking. I have young kids, and I think some of the lessons from that chapter can apply to other peer-pressure issues they will face as they get older."
4,Appealing to the math-nerd in us all,"I am a latecomer to Gladwell. His books have introduced new words into the language--even if he didn't coin them himself, he will get the credit for capturing the public's attention like Al Gore did with global warming. It is easy to see how this science writer worked for a number of prestigious publications; Gladwell can deftly break down complex material into bite-sized morsels that any layman can understand without being condescending to others more in the know, and does so with an infectious (pun intended) enthusiasm. He covers a lot of ground that the math-nerd in me found riveting and I was eager to discuss what I took away from this book. Although he weaves together a number of previously unrelated theories with ease, he doesn't dive too deeply; like Wikipedia he gives us a nicely researched jumping off point for further exploration. At least now I know I'm a Maven..."
2,Not What I Expected,I found parts of the book to be pretty interesting. I do think there's probably some merit to Gladwell's discussions about The Law of the Few and the Stickiness Factor etc. I liked the business examples of how products like Hush Puppies and Sesame Street tipped. But Gladwell spends too much time on human behavior like smoking and suicide etc. But I think there's a difference human behavior like smoking and chosing between numerous products to settle on Hush Puppies. I was disappointed because I thought The Tipping Point was about how make a product or service more popular not an extensive and exhaustive study of human behavior.
3,Interesting read,"I am not an author, but this book doesn't seem to be well written. It has some interesting points, but they could be summed up in a much shorter book."
4,Enjoyable read,"The author explores in this entertaining book how certain epidemics are started. He explains that there are three agents of change:1) Law of the Few - where a few ""exceptional"" people (ones well connected, accumulate information, are persuasive) spread the word2) Stickiness Factor - ways to make the message more memorable3) Power of Context - ways to affect human behavior by tinkering with the immediate environmentHe then uses this framework to explain epidemics varying from fashion trends to the dramatic drop in NYC subway crime rate during the 1990's.Those who have enjoyed Gladwell's other books will not be disappointed."
5,Small Changes Make a Big Difference,"Malcolm Gladwell did a great job in explaining the social phenomenon of ""how little things can make a big difference.""I learned a lot from this book. It was well worth the read, and I would share this book with others. No matter what your place in society, there is a lot of useful information to be gleaned from this book, and you can use them to make a difference for yourself and for others. A great read!"
1,"It is a tipping point, unless it is not","Malcolm Gladwell writes well. But there is not much substance. Sometimes, there is a point in time something changes dramatically. Sometimes, it doesn't come. These first ones are by definition a Tipping Point. Is there anything really interesting here? Not really. How can a tautology be worth a full book? Pages after pages of blah blah blah...."
5,Tipping Point has reached itself.,"Although I usually procrastinate and read in spurts, taking a matter of months to actually finish a book, Tipping Point had me so engrossed that I finished it within a matter of a few days. Gladwell writes in a very easy to read style and the book explains a very different and radical way to approach situations for the best possible outcome that has been proven to work. Ironically enough, it appears that Tipping Point has achieved its own Tipping Point. Highly recommended."
2,Overhyped and Overrated,"This book is a highly dumbed-down discussion of a phenomenon many of us already know -- things happen in a non-linear manner. He cites many examples -- the Hushpuppy resurgence, most famously, but her offers no evidence to back his claims. He merely offers what might be the truth and leaves it at that. I kept waiting for him to get to the point, and then I realized I was reading the last chapter and summing things up.After seeing all the good reviews, I was very disappointed in this book. I will be more skeptical of this genre (and author) in the future."
2,not an engaging read,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. I've slogged through it. I think the author could have made the point in about 20 pages, but instead drags it on and on. The proinciple is noteworthy-- that there is a ""tipping point"" for ideas, products, etc., when they catch on-- but the author makes no real analysis of what that is, therefore there is little to look for other than getting lucky."
3,The tipping point,"Good information, very thoughtful insights in to why some things become a hit while others do not. The insights make sense i have seen those same insights just did not classify them the same way"
5,Fascinating,Although I may not agree with every conclusion (like about his suggestions for tobacco addiction) Malcolm Gladwell is a fascinating guy and has crafted a really good read.
4,Interesting book - You should read it,"Another perspective of marketing. Like it. You should read it. Like how the author categorize the 3 different actors. Maven Market, Connectors and Sales person."
4,A small book with a big impact,"This book is a gem. It turns conventional wisdom on its head and demonstrates how small things can make a big difference. Malcolm Gladwell does a wonderful job of converting a potentially dry boring subject into a extremely interesting read. Good job, Malcolm."
3,GOOD with a small problem,"The book was great, very insightful, not as high as BLINK and definately not like OUTLIERS, his newer books...but still well written. Only issue is the chapter where he talks about SESAME STREET...wayyyy too long."
1,not worth reading,"Gladwell seems to be extremely satisfied with his ideas and terminology -- too bad that I didn't feel the same way. It's all too obvious that he's not a scientist, because many many of his claims are not supported by the evidence that he presents."
5,Great,Great book and fast shipping.Gladwell opens your eyes to the small things we all experience but probably never notice. Great book.
1,Didn't live up to expectations,I know I'm being harsh but this book seemed like a lot of hot air to me. He raises some valid points but failed to close the loop. I was expecting much more.
4,fabulous insights for students of communication,"as a student of communication, i found the book particulary interesting. the chapter on stickiness makes good read with examples from mainstream television. most often theories are presented in a way that cannot be translalted into real life situations, but this book is clearly different. i feel the book is clealy a must for people in advertising, market research and students of communication."
2,Interesting Viewpoint - But That's It,"Didn't do too much for me. An insightful viewpoint on how the world is connected to one another - but hardly a practical viewpoint. Perhaps it suffices for a light Tuesday afternoon train ride, but don't expect to walk away with some tangible notes on how to reinvent your business, your products, etc. Hardly a business book."
1,Scientific Failure,"In general I like reading Malcolm Gladwell, and I've very much enjoyed his lectures and TED talks in the past. I cannot for the life of me understand the glowingly positive reception of this book. It is so full of correlation-causation confusion it's difficult to fathom. The premise is simplistic and the vast majority of examples fail to demonstrate the phenomena in question to any remotely reasonable scientific standard"
4,Tipping point will make you think,I found the book motivational. I began looking for a tipping point in relationships and conversations. It can give you a new look at some old conversations.
1,Not a social scientist,"Fluff, pure fluff. Gladwell is the latest fad, no substance. He sells candy to the masses, disguising it as meat. Therein lies his genius."
1,The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Differe,Gladwell's book attempts to place the same framework on pop culture and public health; it doesn't work well. Equating the wearing of Hush Puppies and cigarette smoking to syphilis and AIDS trivializes the real epidemics. A book should be more than just a long magazine article.
2,well written and... wrong!,"Always be suspicious of non-fiction, persuasive books by greatwriters. They can write complete garbage so sweetly you'll think itcan't be wrong. Case in point. This book tries to solve very hardsociology problems using--guess what? Poor, anecdotal evidence andgreat writing! Though the book is not garbage, its central claim isnot justified by the evidence presented. I hate it when writers try todo scientist's work."
3,Manipulation 101,"This book goes into the scientific aspects of trends, and how to manipulate the public into ""buying it."" Basically, it's a PR book with a twist. As a prerequisite, I recommend Michael Levine's ""Guerrilla PR"" before tackling ""Tipping."" You will have a better grasp of the concepts in this book with a crash course in PR beforehand."
1,What is a Tipping Point?,"Our book club read this as a selection. I think everyone enjoyed it except me. However, I bought it as a used book and it was in great shape and got to me quickly."
4,A very interesting and captivating book,"If you like books that pervade your thought process for a long time, read this book. It is very interesting and allows you to think differently about trends and how they are created. An good analysis of the different types of people who facilitate trends and it's peppered with real world examples that are easy to understand."
1,Poorly Researched,"Gladwell presents untested ideas as if they are valid and tested theories. For example, Dutch researched Jaap Goudsmit proposed that a pneumonia outbreak in the 1950's amongst premature infants in Sweden was caused by underlying HIV infections. This ""idea"" is completely untested and is not accepted by mainstream scientists. Goudsmit makes an extraordinary claim which is not supported by any concrete evidence. He has not isolated any portion of the virus from samples drawn from the victims. Yet Gladwell presents this ""idea"" in his book because it supports his own 'theory' on tipping points.How much nore of this shoddy research is buried in the book? I can't tell you because I stopped reading it since the author has no credibility."
4,Good Insights for Salespeople,"My husband and I are both in sales and I found a lot of good material here that I could apply to my business. Specifically, the second chapter, which focuses on various personality types and their impact on making or breaking trends, was very interesting. My only problem with the book is that the explanations for some of the phenomena (like the drop in crime in New York) are too pat. Rather than point out a vast number of factors that were likely involved in reducing the crime rate, the author boils it all down to One Big Idea That Worked and I just find it hard to believe.Overall, I would say anyone in sales, especially sales that depends on word-of-mouth and client referrals, should at least read the second chapter."
2,Sociology for Dummies,"If you are looking for a collection of unusual stories and pseudo-scientific tales to entertain your friends during the next party, this is the book you are looking for. But if you like real books, i.e. a collection of pages that constitutes a single, valuable, interesting object, then this is not for you. Some of the examples from Malcom Gladwell occupy pages and pages, for no reason. Each basic concept is repeated so many times giving the impression the author is talking to a dummy reader, not to a ""normal"" person. In conclusion, Malcom's book seems to be more a first draft than a finished work. The style is not consistent across chapters, and the connections between chapters and topics is weak."
4,"Good, but nothing tremendously profound","I really enjoyed reading this book. There was a lot of interesting information and it was written in a clear and concise manner. The in-depth histories of Sesame Street and Blues Clues were somewhat fascinating- however, like some of the other reviewers, I felt that a lot of the information was left unconnected. Overall, the book was more informative than a description of how to truly use the tipping points to your advantage."
3,Worth a quick read,"In The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell presents an interesting premise regarding the early formation of trends - what makes certain things catch on and what prevents others from getting off the ground. Although the concepts are presented more from an anecdotal perspective than from a rigorous scientific one, Gladwell is able to nonetheless put forth a concept that merits attention."
5,Eye Opening & Enlightening,"Wow, Marvelous book!! I can't stop reading the book once I started and therefore I finished the book in 3 after-dinner evenings. There are just too many new insights and information. Need to read it more times later to review some of the key points.In essence, the book talks about a simple theory of how things, ideas, products in this world being spread out and hit the ""Tipping Point"". A lot of real life examples and a lot of reference information from sociology, psychology and marketing research are used.The book will surprise you with a different perspective about how things happen in the world. Good for the businessworld as well in marketing new products and ideas.A must read, please !!"
4,"Interesting, but","Really an interesting read and enlightening concept, but no actual resolve. The point should be how to create a tipping point. The data is facinating though and the stories make you wonder - what if things went differently one way or the other. I will say there is a certain encouragement to keep at it, just don't through good money after bad."
5,The Tipping Point,This is one of the few non-fiction books that I just could not put down. It has changed how I view fads and movements. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in financial markets and business planning.
4,"Getting a little ""Tip""-sy","I liked what the author had to say about ""Connectors"" and ""Mavens."" These are social concepts he was able to articulate. On a social level, I think the concept of a ""tipping point"" can be applied to your own personal life. It's the culmination of a lot of little things that can make a big change come about. That's why it's so important to take care of our health: on many different levels. It's not just the physical, but also the emotional, social and mental. Besides this book, I get a lot out of online services like Agogus.com to learn about many different topics (for the connector/maven in me) and to ""tip"" the balance of my mental fitness."
4,Great for better understanding of the society...resulting in better marketing.,"Even though this book is advertising under the section ""Marketing"", don't think that you'll be reading a ""marketing"" book.It is a very interesting book for understanding the power of word of mouth, people, psychology and the world that we live in. What makes a marketer great is his or her understanding of the things that surround them on this earth. It's these kinds of books that help you do that."
3,If I have no other books to read in an airplane...,"First, I bought this book because it's one of our supplemental reference book in class.Second, I was prompted to buy because of good review.It illustrate:- how a small news can easily spread out (The British are coming)- how Hush Puppies shoes was revived in the market- how Sesame Street found its niche in television- how crime was reduced in NY by cleaning up graffiti and fixing broken windowsI consider it more like a history book.This book is quite okay. 50% of what I read are somewhat interesting but nothing in the book so far gave me a WOW."
3,Interesting and light read...but very repetitive,"Interesting book, though there was a fair amount of jumping and a lot of repetition [I was wondering if he got kickbacks every time he mentioned Hush Puppies!] Malcolm Gladwell does generally write well, and the ideas and people behind what causes a ""Tipping Point"" are explained well and in an entertaining manner."
3,Informative,"For such a highly recommended book I had trouble seeing the big deal at first. Like so many other books, this one started out rather slowly, and didn't seem to apply to my life in any way whatsoever. The anecdotes and examples were interesting, but unmoving.Having finished the book I have a completely different perspective. I do not think that I am a Maven, Connector, or Salesman-although I may have minute qualities in common with them-but I certainly see their use. I feel that I have learned more successful ways to pursue a goal or project, as well as useful thought patterns to attack a problem.Gladwell certainly took a potentially dry subject and presented it well. He also helped make sense of seemingly nonsensical phenomena. I particularly appreciated his reference in the epilogue to this country's epidemic of school shootings-especially since I was already heading that direction. A worthwhile read."
4,Engaging,"I found Gladwell's book engaging, but I am not sure that he gave it his best effort. There were many ""studies"" Gladwell refered to where I would ask myself ""What does this have to do with his thesis?"" I felt like the author had heard about some study, found it interesting, and placed it in his book making very stretched and awkwardly fitting ties to his general point.The redemptive characteristic of the book is Gladwell's voice. This alone is worth the price of the book. His tone reminded me of the ""This American Life"" radio shows on National Public Radio. Gladwell keeps you moving and the reader is sort of hypnotized by his cadence. He's a fine writer. I hope he produces many more interesting books. Please pick up a copy of this book for yourself. You will enjoy it. Thank you Mr. Gladwell."
2,"You call this condition ""used:very good""?","Be weary of the description this company uses. The book I purchased was not what I would describe as ""very good"" condition. There is writing in the book, the cover is dirty and the over all appearance is ""good"" at best. Please ""underestimate"" the condition of a book rather than ""overestimate"" it. I would send it back but I don't have time to fool with it."
1,Very dissatisified!,"I ordered this book in early January. As of 2/9/09 I had not received it. A week before that date I had contacted the seller, but got no response. I e-mailed again, and threatened to contest the charge on my credit card. Then I got an answer from the seller saying she could not ship the book. She could have not e-mailed me before I had waited for the book for over a month?Very unprofessional service.My advice: always use a credit card for your purchases."
2,"Uninsightful, written for unintelligent masses","There's nothing new or insightful in this book. If you are looking for something intelligently written, provocative, and rewarding, then look somewhere else."
2,I'm confused....how can he not even mention memes???,"I was drawn to this book based on my enjoyment of Connie Willis's ""Bellwhether"" and Grant Morrisons's ""Invisibles"" which both touch on the topics in this book but I can't for the life of me how can he make a statement to the effect of ""ideas are like viruses"" and not acknowlege ""Memes"". Isnt this bad scientific writting?? Has the author ever addressed his ommision??"
2,Society is not that simple,"The book is about how little events can trigger major tendencies, leading to social-epidemics.As you can expect from books that explore social behavior, the author tries to convince you that his theory can explain human conduct and, thus, modify it. He deals with such diverse issues as crime, teenage smoking, education and other critical subjects. He tries to point out the little events that can change them but do not expect great insights, just ""tips"""
1,Pure Fluff,"This book has no substance. There is one central idea - if a phenomenon reaches a certain critical mass, it will grow exponentially. Gladwell then ""backs up"" this idea with anecdotal fluff that is mildly entertaining, but a waste of the reader's time. If your'e interested in viral marketing or similar ideas, read ""The Anatomy of Buzz"". It has far more substance.Gladwell's success lies in knowing what people want to believe and finding a gimmicky way to title his books. His new book ""Blink"" tells us that snap decisions are better than considered ones. I should have applied that to the purchase of this book. Every time I scanned it in a bookstore, I thought it wasn't worth reading beyond the introduction. Finally I bought it. I read it, and made a snap decision. It's the only book I've returned to the bookstore in 10 years."
4,Must reading for all entrepreneurs,"If you are an entrepreur, a trend setter, want to find out how to set a new trend, read this book. The Tipping Point is for entrepreneurs; for pace setters, innovators and originators. Not me too people.I got a lot out of this book. Just the story on hush puppies alone was inspiring.How many Michael Dell's, Bill Gate's etc. will be created from this book? Read it and become one yourself.This book is must reading. Highly recommended."
1,Should've been a magazine article,"Gladwell makes a few vague connections and comes up with some interesting points, and then fills the balance of the book with fluff and name dropping (it could've been written in 28 pages instead of 280.) This would've made a good feature article in a magazine, but a complete book it should not be."
5,Great Read,"Criticize him all you want, but Gladwell has a knack for making science and research attainable. The story reads like a novel and the science is sound, just told in a way that is more narrative then a research paper."
5,Real life Situations,"I loved this book and have read it many times. As a school principal I have seen many schools become great schools and many lose their students and parent support over a single trend such as test scores, someone starts a bad Rumor, word of mouth and etc. The book gave me insights into human behavior and elevated my thinking to a new level."
5,The tipping Point by Gladwell,"Outstanding, informative, revealing, that's what I think of this book. Malcolm gladwell does a great job at investigating a topic and explaining it in easy to undestand language. Find out how authorities beat crime in the New York Subway System, and apply the same principles to make positive changes in your life. I've read three of his books in the last two weeks; they are all great.The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference"
2,It's boring...,"The book is not as good as expected. The world has completely changed since Internet. The book talks about tipping points before ""the world is flat"". The viewpoints in the book may not apply to the new era. I always fall into sleep when I read it. The author's Outlier is much better than this one."
1,Lost the point??,"If this book has a point, it is one of no significance of how these ideas can be applied, harnessed or can be useful in any shape or form. IF you appreciate random thoughts that now in the light of hind-sight and the present can be translated and shaped to mean something, then this is a book for you. I would not recommend it, if you have nothing else whatsoever to read or do."
4,Truly enjoyable non-fiction,"Living in New York, I can never cross a street now without thinking of this book.Other than the too long analysis of Sesame Street, this was a wonderful thought provoking take on factors that affect everyday society."
5,Obvious? Too obvious!,"This book contains insight into very different phenomenon, making sense of difficult concepts. A facinating read that will help you to understand society just a little better. Can't ask more of a book than that."
2,if you want to keep reading the same thing page after page...,"you get the gist of the whole thing in the first couple of chapters...later on its the same thing over and over and over... to know what really tipping point is, please pick up this book, you will know it when you drop it..."
3,Interesting book....but not thorough enough,"I picked this book to read after seeing good reviews and some interesting discussions about the book. I found the first part of the book particularly interesting about how little things make a big difference (i.e. the sale of Hush Puppy shoes, the famous ride of Paul Revere and the reasons he was successful that night, etc...). The book, however, loses its direction in the second half of the book. He cites some simple psychological examples, but the more I read the more I could easily debate/debunk some of his ideas/theories.It's an interesting book, but it's not thorough enough in its arguments."
4,FASCINATING,"Even for those of us with little real interest in marketing, this book is fascinating, clear and informative, and entertaining to boot. It will open your mind to our popular culture and the way things happen in ways you might never have thought of before. The examples used are of interest to everyone, from Hush Puppies to the NYC crime rate -- why do things become the rage, what is the tipping point???? You will be very intrigued to learn Gladwell's well-supported theories. Believe it or not, this is a great summer read, and moves quickly, like a suspense story."
4,New perspectives on some familiar ground...,"Gladwell covers a lot of ground but much of it seems familiar. He brings some new ideas but in general I think he's mostly compiled concepts formed originally by others. Granted, by bringing these concepts together in this form he has clearly added significant value. Without Gladwell's work in The Tipping Point, many, many people would have never heard of some these concepts.Bottom line...if you are really well read you will find you are already aware of a considerable portion of what Gladwell provides. You will gain from reading his work though. By bringing it together he creates an opportunity to consider things in different ways than you probably have before.Best Of The Book: Gladwell's presentation on Connectors, Mavens, and Salesmen in his section ""The Law of the Few"".I recommend the book for anyone interested in thinking outside of what's obvious or what we are typically told.I hope you enjoy The Tipping Point."
4,Highly Insightful,"What I like about this title is that it goes in a new direction. The old style business books are no longer relevant and this title is in my estimation very much about understanding ""new"" business.If you want to get un-stuck, pick up this title and join the 21st century!"
5,Don't Blink...,"I loved this book. It's not as good as Blink (by the same author), but still an excellent read...Highly Recommended!"
4,Excellent book to understand the viral phenomena,"After read this book, I got a better understanding of what it make a product fail or make it in the market, why a better product can lose ground in front of a mediocre well presented product. If you are interested in Marketing, or in start you own project, this book will help you to find few key elements."
4,A fun and enlightening read,"This book is one that I think should be read by all people in business as it has some great ideas for turning business ideas into epidemics. It talks about the stickiness effect, mavens and connectors among other things that all contribute to the success of products and ideas. It also discusses the ""broken window"" syndrome and the power of context in influencing the outcomes of different situations.I read this and ""Freakonomics"" one after the other. They are both excellent books but I enjoyed this one more."
4,Interesting Ideas,"""The Tipping Point"" is an interesting read, with compelling arguments for how and why certain social epidemics (the sudden onset of changes in fashion or behavior) are like a disease epidemics. Although I don't feel like any of the ideas included are universal in application, there is certainly food for thought, and it is interesting to try to plug in the theories to different phenomena, to see if it does apply. Overall, I recommend this book as an insightful look at sociological phenomenon."
3,Hmmm...,"Like so many books in this genre, The Tipping Point feels as though it has been put through a large generic editing machine. The voice and readability are so very similar to many other management/advertising/business books out there.Similarly, the central thesis is as weak as one might expect. But then Idea-as-Hero rarely works well, and extended biological analogies for human behavior are never going to amount to too much.And as is the bane of many other authors, editing lets him down and factual errors abound. For example, he embraces the idea of patient-zero in his AIDS case study, begging the question of how often does it have to be disproved before the concept goes away.BUT, and it is a big but, the case studies used by Gladwell remain compelling reads. The book remains a good read. Despite these criticisms I read it in a few hours, and came away feeling poked and nudged into looking just a little differently at things."
5,Great!,I enjoyed reading the book! This is my third Malcolm Gladwell book and I still find him entertaining.
4,title says it all and then does it,"I have been teaching marketing for over 15 years and although most of the concepts espoused in the book are not original, I found the book to be extremely entertaining and useful in streamlining my views on this subject. Gladwell uses the concept of the diffusion of innovations to explain how ideas, trends, and even radical change in human behavior are spread by ""little things."" Taken to the extreme it leaves a feeling of helplessness since from a marketing standpoint no matter how good everything is, ultimately you have to reach the ""tipping point"" that could conceivably be as trivial as having that ""right-looking"" package. The book is not meant to be an academic treatise, and some of the other reviews that test it against that standard are missing the point. The book itself attests to the power of Gladwell's argument in that a catchy title is what is tipping the scale to spread an old idea and make it seemingly a new one."
4,"Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen","The most significant item to come from Tipping Point was the identification of three types of people - Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen. Very insightful information here that has real world application especially for marketers looking to have a word of mouth phenomenon. For the most part the examples given throughout the book of tipping points for various situations were great. Felt the book started to drag a bit at the end, however would still recommend the Tipping Point. If you like Tipping Point, also check out Gladwell's Blink."
5,From a mainstream point-of-view,"I am not a sociologist, so I am not analysizing this book from that perspective. It is neither a textbook nor a scientific treatise, and I did not expect it to be. I am looking at it just as an intrigued reader, and that being the case I really, really enjoyed this book. It gets a star for each of my following criteria: I learned something new, it kept my interest throughout, I would recommend it to a friend, I would be willing to re-read it in the future, and I do not regret the money I spent on it. It's that simple. I had never given much thought to why something ""tips"", and could not have explained such a phenomenon if asked to. Gladwell very clearly explains the factors required for such a result, and thoroughly educated me on personality types and methods of interaction that I had known little of before. I am looking forward to reading ""Blink"" now, and hope I learn as much from it."
1,Something Smells Here,"Look, every time someone writes an objection to this book, someone else writes a lengthy--and annoynomous tribute that appears to be the work of a professional. It seems to me that it is not only casual readers who are contributing their comments here, but publicists and promoters. As an earlier critic pointed out, this book is being pushed mightily by its publisher, who invested heavily in it. Making this a best seller is job number one for these folks, but as many commenters have noted, few serious professional critics have taken more than passing notice of this book. (Rather than reading the isolated blurbs offered here, I suggest readers turn to the full text of reviews appearing in, for example, the New York Times and Salon.) It seems to me that someone is making sure that any criticism of Tipping Point on this site is blotted out by a stream of raves. This is neither fair to the reader nor, for that matter, really honest."
1,B double O ring,I bought this book and read it half way through. It was soo damn boring to read. Just opinions on what caused what. It was absolutely dreadful and was a good way to fall asleep. Sold it back on amazon for 8 bux.
5,Little things make a big difference,A really facinating look at how seemingly small things make such a big difference in how we as a society understand and accept things.I found this book really facinating.
4,Can Content Equal Concept?,"In the case of ""The Tipping Point"", Gladwell admirably backs up his concept. The positives lie in not prolonging the concept into a lengthy treatise, and well-researched case studies. At times, though, the book gets muddled - and that is the only negative."
2,interesting but gets off track,Interesting book but spends a lot of time on what seems to be child psychology and testing of TV shows as opposed to the tipping point subject.
4,On Target,"So good, so easy to read, so on target about how word of mouth marketing happens and how to try and create it, I bought copies for my marketing class in the middle of the semester so they could also gain this insight and knowledge."
5,BRILLIANCE,"The Tipping Point is an invaluable resource for almost all aspects of life, but particularly for marketing. I originally read the print version, much of which is so ""sticky"" I still remember it and quote from it years later despite only reading it once. I have now purchased the CD's so that I can continue to delve into the intricasies of Gladwell's brilliant work while driving in my car."
4,Semi -Interesting,Good book that is semi-interesting. Will probably never use anything that is contained between it's covers. I know it was a best seller. But so what?? I think people are reading it because everyone else is.
5,"Not only a great conversation piece, but a great book.","I read this book over a year ago and the ideas and material are still fresh in my mind. I can not say that about most books that I read.This book does contain survey data. Like all research, some of the methodology could be questioned. So careful reading is required. Gladwell may lean a little to the left on some of his issues, but overall I did not feel that he was pushing a political agenda. Some of his ideas appear to be brilliant, but mostly likely idealistic. However, his phenomenon thesis and his ability to construct and presuade us along make this book an excellent read.When I first read this book I had to tell everyone about it. My wife was sick of me talking about ""The Tipping Point."" Over a year later, I still recommend this book to people. If you are interested in science, medicine, public policy, marketing, or social issues, you will enjoy this book. I think that pretty much includes 90% of us, so read this book."
1,Not a good book,This is not a good book. The author tries to make the book longer by talking about the same simple idea again and again. Just search on Google and you will get all the ideas in the book. I am not recommending anyone to buy this book.
3,Tipping toward excellence,This book is helpful for any organization or individual with a product or service to promote. It provides suggestions for creating a message and building connections that are critical to any target market.
4,"Good read, good points to ponder","Its not real deep, but there is some good insight. His take on what contributed to the lowering of the crime rate in New York and why anti Cigarette ads weren't working (I notice that now however the anti cigarette ads are focused on the types of things he said would work) was quite interesting. Also his logic and discourse regarding the types of people that generate the process of getting something to go from the unknown to popular state is fascinating. Interesting as it was, it lacked depth and was seemed to be mostly hypothesis and there seemed to be little in the way of statistics to bear out his theories. But an enjoyable read nevertheless."
2,Faded in and out...,"While the first two chapters were extremely interesting, I felt that Gladwell would elaborate for too long on his examples of tipping points. After Chapter 2, the text fluctuated from ""very interesting"" to ""I want to put this book down and forget that I ever heard of it."""
3,"Quick Read, Info Lite","Gladwell's book is an simple read requiring very little cranial agitation. Chock full of half-cocked theories and superfluous tangents, The Tipping Point is a prime example of pop pseudo-science at it's finest. I advise you to search elsewhere if you are genuinely interested in researching social outbreak phenomena.That being said, I would be remiss if I failed to mention that I did enjoy the book. It was, perhaps, a bit like a Saturday morning cartoon--mindless entertainment with perhaps a single thought provoking scene, or two. Interestingly enough, I found the book's tangents to be of more educational value than it's core message. I was particularly struck by the profiles of several of the books ""characters,"" and the story of the origin of Sesame Street.This is definately a ""borrow-from-the-library"" book, but if you're looking for a good pool-side, lazy day drifter, this is a good pick."
3,No Action Plan... but still,Much like this authors other books I am intrigued and entertained. Sadly however I walk away without a concrete application plan. The content was educational and can be applied to life and business but I wish there had been strategies outlined on how create or prevent a tipping point
4,Interesting yet missing something.,"Brings up many interesting questions of how the world works, yet it still misses on truly explaining why the phenomena we experience truly behave in such a manner. To say it is this magical tipping point is oversimplified. He is on the right track and I am waiting for the next step."
3,"Like a good comedy routine, it highlights...","...the little things we all know, or at least sense intuitively, but don't really examine or ""put together"" until somebody else presents them in a new and compelling way. This is also what makes, say, George Carlin so successful: He's not really saying anything that hasn't been said; he's just saying it smarter and funnier, so it stays with you. The sad part is that there are so many other self-appointed gurus out there who attempt to do what Gladwell does, but without his core-level insight--and then they'll expand those discrete observations into catchy, self-styled (and highly profitable--for them) ""programs for better living"" based on zero evidence of efficacy or proven value. If you want to see what I mean, check out my blog, www.shambook.blogspot.com. It'll open your eyes.Steve Salerno, author, SHAM: How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless"
3,Tipping Point - How to make it happen.,"There are several books of this genre, like The Anatomy of Buzz, Seth Godin's two books and Engaged Customer. While the examples given in The Tipping Point were interesting, it does not really tell a reader how to make a situation tip. What are the buttons to push. It just makes an interesting read especially that research done at the seminary."
1,An idea worthy of a column blown up into a book,"Aside from offering a layman's opinion and coming up with his own ""tipping point"" name for what is otherwise known as a ""fad"", the author describes his idea completely in the first chapter, and then redundantly re-describes it over and over again in every other way he can think of in order to turn it into a book. Snooze. Where's the beef? The idea of the ""tipping point"" can be described in a couple of paragraphs, so save yourself some bucks and time and read the book description - you'll be covered."
2,A Sad Commentary on Group Think,"How desperate are we to be included with others who think this book is some sort of revelation?While I'll admit it's a mildly interesting read, let's get real...this book does nothing more than take the basic principle of cause-and-effect and try to elevate it to folklore status.It's also riddled with half-truths and skewed conclusions -- some even nonsensical. Take the author's slam on Sesame Street vs. Blue's Clues for example. He notes that kids scored better on problem-solving after some watched Blue's Clues and and some watched Sesame Street.No kidding?? Really?? Could that be because problem solving is the sole focus of Blue's Clues?? Have the kids recite the alphabet or test their grammer skills afterward. Hmmm....Basic cause-and-effect....nothing more. C'mon people -- think for yourselves!"
2,I wasn't sold...,"The introduction and the first chapter interested me into reading more about ""the tipping point"". But after the 2nd chapter, it was hard to continue reading. The anecdotes were interesting and I could see the points he was trying to make. But I felt like I was reading a college student's final paper who, in trying to get a point across, takes a psychological study and says, ""this study shows why my theory is right"". I would have been more sold on his theories if he did his own studies to make his point."
3,This is a best seller?,"The title and the cover are quite catchy. The book is more sociologically based, with some tidbits on marketing. Discusses the fact that small acts can cause ""tipping points"" or major change. Not totally convincing but possible. Examples (and patriotic ones at that) are very stretched out and could be more to the point. The book might be of more interest if one is a sociologist and doesn't mind some fluff, but frankly I thought the book was mediocre."
4,"Interesting, but lacking","I recently finished this book for my college Freshman summer reading. At first I had heard that it was a book with a lot of repitition and that it was extremely dry. Of course, I didn't buy that, so I read on. By the middle, I had found that it was not all that repetitive, but, on the contrary, very interesting and encouraging. HOWEVER, I did notice that the book was slightly ""light and fluffy,"" if you will, around the way the facts and statistics were presented.In short, I was required to read this book, would reccommend it, but also would concede that it was a bit shallow in the use of facts. (In all other ways, quite thourough.)"
4,Who is this guy?,"What a thinker! The tipping point is that focus around which, trends, whether in fashion or technology explode into the mainstream. Attempts to explain why some individuals and/or products make it big in entertainment, business, etc. The book is very intriguing.Gladwell attempts to explain the causes of social epidemics. He's a journalist, not a scientist, so hard evidence is not what you'll find in his book. Mostly theory, but justified and well thought out."
2,"Repetitive, boring, could not finish.","I had high hopes for this book after reading Outliers, which I gave five stars. Maybe that was my problem, but this book became really repetitive.After the topic of hushpuppy shoes came up again about 25% through this book, I had to say no more."
4,used books,The same book as a new one but saved a lot of money compared to anew one and the book is in fine shape saves on college supplys
3,It was OK,"The book was OK, interesting and promising in the begging and actually provides some good ideas to be applied in the business arena. After the first half because a bit slow and repetitive for me and couldn't continue reading all of it."
2,struggling...,I usually read books in a few days...I find myself struggling through this one. The concepts within the book are interesting but not presented in a way that is cohesive and understanding. There is a lot of jumping and oftentimes all the narrative blurs into eachother.
2,Not sure what he's trying for,"If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point. Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated. He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory. Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less."
2,Subjective Science?,"I had high hopes for the book, and had spoken to others who had heard good things about it. However, it just didn't do it for me. Reading the author's subjective input on topics discredits the message he is attempting to convey to the reader, even after he has spent whole chapter giving sub-par data and information. It seemed as though the only data which mattered to the author was the data which proved the point he was attempting to make.In short, I would not recommend this book. After I was about halfway through I was ready to quit, but I finished it just in case it might happen to improve; it did not. The author's opinion on social matters and subjectivity in regards to research were enough to turn me away from this book and any other book he has written."
5,"Looking to answer the why questions of today epidemics, read this!",Puts personalities in accordance with situations and circumstances in perspective for an epidemic to occur or spiral out of control in good or bad ways.
4,Having been hugely happy with Blink!,"Having been hugely happy with Blink! I went out and purchased The Tipping Point almost right away. It, like most the other books I purchase, sat on a bookcase dedicated solely to books-yet-to-read until a few days ago. And now it shall be moved to its permanant home on a different bookcase. The point of all of this is that The Tipping Point is a well-researched, highly interesting, and unique book. The problem is that it, like Blink!, doesn't stick (see book for details). It's interesting but doesn't have the stickiness of most bestsellers, and is most certainly not something I would have watched the count down date for publishing like I'm doing with a few others. Good, but not great. Interesting, but not facinating. A 4, but not a 5."
5,The Tipping Point,"An important work for doers and thinkers throughout the world, The Tipping Point reveals how little insignificant but concious acts can cause dramatic results. Thinking in terms of an epidemic, one can see how a trend can tip into a massive movement.More important, however is that concious action on even a small scale can bring big results. Case in point is the story of the drop in crime in New York City. Two small but significant changes in policy and thought brought about this massive change.While the terms connectors, mavens and salesmen may seem a little obscure, great value can be gleaned from envisioning oneself in these roles.Finally, on a lighter note, having never played the ""Kevin Bacon game"", I was pleasantly surprised to see that Bacon is way down the list of connectedness.Read, better yet, absorb this book."
5,"Interesting, informative book.","I had read and enjoyed 'Blink' and I am happy to say that ""Tipping Point"" is just as enjoyable. Malcolm Gladwell discusses the theory that a trend or idea builds slowly until it 'tips' and shoots into the mainstream. He identifies the people who are essential in establishing trends: the Innovators, the Connectors, the Salesmen, and others. He uses examples from how Hush Puppies was saved from bankruptcy thanks to a few kids in the New York club scene to why we all remember Paul Revere but not William Dawes, even though they both rode out to warn the countryside that night. If you ever thought that small changes are useless in overcoming a big problem, ""The Tipping Point"" may well change your mind."
4,Tipped towards a recommendation,"I have enjoyed his writing in the New Yorker, and this is the first book of Gladwells that I have read. (Have not read Blink as of yet.) He is a superb writer. My reservation here is that sometimes he states his thesis but the support he gives for it is either weak or unsupportive. This happens infrequently, of course.The idea of a tipping point helps explain fads and phenomena that seem to come out of nowhere, when in reality, there is a history and track record. Making a tipping point occur, which is what many marketers (and politicians) is a different story: Gladwell does not give you the secret formula, and probably does not believe there is one."
3,good book pushed to make word count,I liked alot of the concepts and will put them too work but the book is full of quoted materiel and redundant information. At one point he prints a full page quote in two different places to make an esoteric point about the correlation between suicides in micronesia and the tipping point. the book is like a long movie that would be excellent if 30 percent of the scenes were removed or shortened.
1,Lacking Depth and Explanation,"I had high hopes for this book after discussing with a colleague. The first few chapters had me intrigued in some of the concepts. As someone who is very involved in sales and working with customers to adopt new concepts and ideas the idea of Tipping Point is fascinating to me. However, the book did not deliver any depth or explanation of the concept of Tipping Point.This book is a collection of examples and clever stories around the idea of social epidemics and trends. The book provides us with many specific examples of trends the author associates to Tipping Points. I found these examples to be entertaining and made for good dinner conversation. The book does not however provide much insight and exploration into Tipping Point. I kept waiting for the author to bring it all together in a consumable and usable way, but it never came."
1,Book was wrinkled,"The book that I bought was new, and was a gift for my husband's boss. The book cover was bent and it certainly didn't look new."
5,Collective Subconscious,"This book reminds me of the concept of The Collective Subconscious, and I do believe in that concept. There is a level of human communication that occurs without words, almost without thought. I believe Plato is one of the early sources of this concept with a ""single mind"" principle. All minds are part of one ""deep"" mind, so to speak-- not necessarily in a mystic way, although that possibility should never be ruled out. This book is great. Don't listen to those who say otherwise. It has sold millions of copies for a reason! It has personally changed my life, and in fact when I was reading it I was driving my girlfriend nutty by constantly saying, ""Hey, listen to this. Listen to this."""
3,Interesting but not science,"I agree with most reviewers that this book has interesting anecdotes and makes interesting points. I found, however, that his theory has very little to do with science. His anectdotes are just that, and his attempt to explain widely differing phenomena by simple rules is thought provoking, but not scientific or rigorous. In fact, some of his examples didn't seem to fit the definition of tipping or epidemics and the more I read, the less his rules seem to ""stick."" But, the book is well written, is worth reading for the anecdotes, and it may inspire others to create a more rigorous theory for tipping."
4,Pretty interesting look at what makes a trend 'work.',"This is actually a fairly interesting look into what makes a trend catch on and what makes other's fail.Gladwell uses some great examples to support his theories, and, while some of them he uses probably too much, they still serve to support his points extremely well.If you like wondering what makes a society of individuals funtion as 'one' towards the rise and fall of a trend, this is a terrific book. It will also help you realize just how much of our own ideas aren't as much our own as we might want to think they are.Overall, you can't really go wrong with this book if mass communication or sociological topics interest you."
4,A question (while joining positive reviews).,"How, when and where did the present `scooter' craze start? Is then a second edition on its way with the answer?"
1,This might have appealed to me in college.,"Not a book for thinkers, but rather a tome for those who prefer to be told how to think, what's important, what's profound. If you are an intelligent reader, I suggest you pass on this bloated attempt at insight. In addition to being trite, the book is poorly written, almost like a term paper: a, b, c, d; with little journalistic asides of the most pedestrian kind. Those of you who have favorably reviewed this book should stop to examine your powers of discrimination and original thought."
4,Loved it!,"This is an easy read! Real stories of fads, TV shows, epidimics, etc. and how they happened. Absolutely fascinating..."
2,disappointing,"I was expecting a lot more than just 20 minutes of (relatively) poor quality news comment/coverage of Grace Kelly's funeral. If all of the ""ABC News Classics"" are like this, then they are best avoided in my opinion.That'll teach me to buy something before Amazon had added all of the product details!"
5,ok,ok i don't like haveing to waste time writeing any more than what i said in the subject line thanks
1,Digital Copy is worthless,"Dittos on all the digital copy reviews. If you have any expectations of using the digital copy in iTunes, you will not be able to do it. UltraViolet is an online streaming service. DIGITAL COPY should not be used to describe this part of the product, and Amazon needs to correct it's advertising so that they are not part of the scam. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT A REAL DIGITAL COPY."
1,Digital Copy and Playstation download - Hoax,I know some people are already commenting on the Digital Copy issue with the movie which is horrendous not to mention a security issue that I am trying to address with Amazon not to mention the Wi-Fi requirement. The other issue is the Playstation download of the Batman/Sinestro suit for Arkham City. There is NO code on the back. It has the insructions but no code. Amazon's response is just to return the DVD and they will send another but that does nothing to solve the issue of the digital copy nor does it help with the code for the game. Does anyone know another place to get this with a genuine digital copy and that might NOT have the issue with the Playstation code.
1,Awful,"This movie makes all the old Batman movies with George Clooney look like The Dark Knight. I'd rather watch Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr Freeze 10 times in a row than watch Ryan Reynolds make magical green hot wheels car plow through a sweaty guy with alien powers. This movie is garbage. Ryan Reynolds should have stuck with Deadpool, not this green turd."
4,A pretty good start for a favorite DC hero,"First, I own the non-3D extended-version. As with any movie, it could have been better. The special effects were amazing, and I loved the 'making of' features on the disk. Ryan Reynolds did a great job as Hal/Green Lantern, I must give him credit for that. The writing of his character was a bit loose, though. Blake Lively was excellent as Carol Ferris."
3,"Good Movie, slow start","I was not familiar with the Green Lantern back story so things started a bit slow. Once the movie got into the story it moved along. Great CG. Ryan Reynolds is not your typical action hero, but does a good job with this role. He looks great in costume."
2,Don't Expect Much,"I rented this film primarily because Ryan Reynolds was in it. That turned out to be its only selling point. This movie is a special effects bonanza, but for the first time, I found them distracting. Character development was minimal and I can actually remember very little of the story. I am glad I didn't invest in owning this movie."
3,Good,"The film is good, but I would have liked more action, but I recommend it because it keeps the plot of the comic."
3,More than I expected,"I expected this movie to be awful. While it wasn't something fantastic, it was better than I thought it would be. Worth renting, unless you catch it on sale. The Ultraviolet digital copy is for Flixter instead of itunes, which is a pain, but we don't buy our movies for the digital versions anyways."
4,Entertaining movie,"This was an entertaining movie that could have used more science fiction and less romance. Growing up with comic books, it's been a great few years seeing production companies promoting Marvel and DC superheroes to the big screen. Reynolds is a good Green Lantern, but I feel they're bending the character to his persona versus the other way around. CGI is good and storyline was informative to the GL newcomers. The story has been set for number 2, so hopefully producers make the most of it."
1,No iTunes Digital Copy,"I like buying BluRays that come with an iTunes copy, I get the HD BluRay and then the iTunes copy which is easy to add to iTunes and then effortlessly works on AppleTV or any iOS device. I'll pass on any BluRay that comes with an UltraViolet copy and just buy my digital copy directly from iTunes. Oh yeah, saw the movie in the theater, AWESOME movie."
1,Ultra Violet is Horrible...,"Ultra Violet is horrible. Movies was OK..The fact you can't add the movie to iTunes is a bad idea, controlling.Down with Ultra Violet"
1,DO NOT BUY. Ultraviolet a SCAM!!!,"I mistakenly bought this thinking I was getting a Digital copy. I now know I was scammed.Now that I know what they are trying to sell, I will NEVER buy another DVD with the Ultraviolet.Somebody needs to tell WB that this a big management mistake, along the lines of New Coke and Netflix raising rates by 60%. Netflix's decision cost them 70% of their market value. Here's hoping WB has an equally painful lesson."
5,Great Movie (IMHO),"I'm not sure why this movie got such poor reviews. I enjoyed quite a lot and would look forward to seeing the sequel that I'm assuming will come (???). I've never read the comics, so that might be partly why I was able to enjoy as much as I did. It was a fun action-filled ride with RR"
2,Bad Form,"Enjoyed the movie itself. However, I was very disappointed that the ""digital copy"" is not compatible with Itunes. Who uses ultraviolet and is happy with it? I will not be purchasing anymore WB products if they are not available from Itunes. Bad choice teaming up with Flickster in my opinion."
2,"Movie worth a rental, ultraviolet digital copy is horrible","While the movie is a passable version of the GL universe, the ultraviolet digital copy is virtually worthless. You can't transfer the UV copy to itunes unless you rip the DVD on your own. If you want an itunes compatible digital copy then you're pretty much out of luck."
2,Ultraviolet Digital Copy is a disappointment,I specifically choose Blu-Rays that have digital copies so I can load them on my iPod. The Ultraviolet digital copy is unlike any of the others I have purchased and I found it extremely frustrating trying to load it onto the player. This technology is not ready for prime time.
2,bleh and digital copy,"This movie did not live up to my expectations. Compared to movies like Thor and X-men First Class it has little that resembles a plot.If you love CGI, this movie has a lot of that. If you want to watch an actual movie and not simply a compilation of CGI with dashes of a storyline, you are SOL.If you are still curious, save the $25 on this DVD combo and rent the movie. IF you decide to buy the blue ray combo for the digital copy please note that this copy IS NOT COMPATIBLE with iTunes.... rather they make you join flixter. How the @@@ do I watch the movie if I have no internet connection say during an airplane trip you monkeys?!?"
3,"EXTENDED CUT IS AN IMPROVEMENT, BUT GREEN LANTERNS LIGHT DOESN'T SHINE BRIGHT!","OK, I'm a Marvel guy, but I have respect for DC and their heroes. Hard to argue with their two mega stars Superman and Batman, but I like most of the heroes, Green Lantern being one of them, The Flash and the Atom being two more. This film is full of colorful special effects and Reynolds should be able to add some humor to this very complex origin, but the film just isn't much fun.The second half of the film does pick up a bit, but not enough to save this from being just better than average in the superhero genre. The three disc 3D/Blu Ray/DVD combo sports a nice transfer and some cool extras. I don't bother with digital copies, so I don't know anything about that...only what I've read which isn't very good.If you're a fan of GL, then you probably have seen this, but if you're looking to learn more about this hero, maybe one of his comic books would be a better bet."
3,simply ok,"I had read pretty awful reviews about this movie, so I wasn't expecting much. I actually thought it was ok. Ryan Reynolds does as much as he can with a slow, underdeveloped story line. You'd think that a comic book based movie would have more action to carry it, but alas, in this case, you'd think wrong."
4,Green Lantern,"I know critics did not like this movie, but I thought it was a great super hero movie. I love super hero movies and this one had everything a good super hero movie needs. It has a great hero , who has alien contact. He turns from a regular guy into a great hero. Then. He accepts the duty to save the universe. After some great action he wins . Critics I think always gives super hero movies a hard time. I think this movie is one they wrongly reviewed."
2,Digital Copy Not Compatible with iTunes,"This release of Green Lantern claims you get a digital copy of the movie, but instead you are asked to create an account to Flixster which then streams the movie to your device. You don't get an actual copy of the movie that can be stored on your iPhone/iPod/iPad. Streaming doesn't work at 35,000 feet, which is where I typically have the time to watch a movie. There is nothing about this digital copy that is iTunes compatible, so it's unlikely you can stream it to your Apple TV. Overall a big disappointment. I'll have to reassess paying additional money for movies from Warner Brothers that claim a digital copy."
1,Buy Blu-Ray version only!!,I liked this movie. What ticked me off was the crap Ultraviolet digital copy that doesn't work on iTunes or anything else but their crappy service. This is very misleading. I hope Warner Bros. wakes up and tosses this new service. Absolute garbage. Please stop it!!
1,"Waste of money paying for the ""digital copy""",The digital copy would not work on either my iphone/ipad and I could care less about this flixster thing. The movie industry needs to wake up and offer DRM free copies for mobile use and stop inconveniencing honest customers. The pirates have these ripped and playable for any devices within days and we end up with digital copy protection that makes the video useless for copying to our portable devices.
1,Good intentions gone horribly wrong!,"Like a number of reviewers here I bought this combo-pack for the digital movie too. Trying to support the legit ownership of a digital copy. DC Comics and Warner Brothers have failed miserably here with their partnership with Flixster and this so called company UltraViolet. To ""own"" your digital copy you must register with Flixster and somehow link an account into the UltraViolet website. After a few days of trying this - complete failure! There must be no one at either company supporting this. We are being forced to support another portal, another format and very few devices (if any) that can play ultraviolet content.Amazon is pretty liberal with their return policies, and I am considering returning this combo-pack.As for the movie - I give it a five star. Its a fun ride. But for this releases utter lack of respect for the consumer a solid one-star."
1,Ultraviolet is a massive joke and waste of time,"I have hated and despised my Ultraviolet experience. You have to sign-up for at least two accounts (UV and Netflix is my example). Neither of which seems to be able to show me Green Lantern (can't even find it to stream it). Much less download it to my iPad. Geez, I feel like such a sap. Never again will I touch another movie that offers UV for my ""digital download""."
3,Sonny d,"Most people buy a movie with the digital copy so they don't have to spend the time downloading it from the internet. Pretty much UltraViolet FAILED to see this concept. Not to mention the hassle of registering & downloading another program. Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie."
3,"Love Ryan Reynolds, but...","The story line and the action didn't quite do it for me for this comic-turned-movie version of Green Lantern. Also, unlike many other digital copies that come with the movie, this digital copy must be played in the Flixter app. Quite annoying..."
2,There are better movies out there!,"This story has been told and told and told. It's known to every comic book kid in the world. The beginning of the Earther Green Lantern. It was just recently re-re-redone in animation, full length feature film only about two years or so ago and now we get to see the same, identical movie done with real life actors using CG instead of animation... oh boy, I can't wait to read The Hobbit again, for the 27th time... Couldn't Hollywood use SOME OTHER STORYLINE for once?!"
1,Great movie bad digital copy.,This movie is great but don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray with digital copy. The digital copy requires you to install third party software and input personnel information just to get the copy. And then it runs on the third party software not via iTunes. This is the biggest rip off yet. You spend extra money to get it on an iPod/iPad/iTunes and it will not go but no were on the box does it state this limitation. RIP OFF.
1,Does not actually have digital copy,"Beware, the ""digital copy"" included with this combo is NOT an actual digital copy. It is access to a STREAMING copy, which you can only watch through Flixter's proprietary player. You can download it, but that's still not a real digital copy. That is still only watchable through Flixter's player on a computer. There is no way to watch the downloaded copy on a tablet or ipod. I wanted to watch it on my tablet, which does not have an internet connection. I paid extra for the combo pack because it was a good value to have a digital copy, only to discover there is no such thing with this combo.If you're buying this because it's a good value to get all three copies, do the math for just the two copies, unless you are okay with having a streaming copy as your third version and not a real digital copy."
1,The actors are prettier than the CGI,"Terrible writing. The actors do what they can, but their performances are lacking, especially under directing that feels like it's just following the formula. Skarsgaard does the best job. Reynolds is charming, but his character isn't. It's hard to care what happens. Save your money."
5,Great Family Show,"Great show for young family. Hardly any bad language, clean, typical superhero story line, adventure, and fun. I liked this actor for the role of Green Lantern. Kids are into the Justice League cartoons so they really liked this. Also good clean movie for adults to enjoy also."
3,The bottom on our list of Super Hero Movies,"We love super hero movies. We've seen them all. I have two boys, so that is what I have watched as my boys have grown up (now 9 and 13) instead of Princess movies. I am disgusted with the language at the beginning of this movie and I don't think this movie is near as well made as the other movies. My boys didn't even ask for us to buy it. I bought it on Lightning deals because it was 1.97 and My older son may watch it with me one more time, but for the most part it won't get watched very much. I was disgusted with the language in X-men first class sprayed unneccessarily throughout as well."
2,Its ok,I'm not a fan of CGI and there is far too much of it in this movie. CGI just looks fake to me.
2,good,the quality of the image is bad but the service is excellentthe quality of the image is badthe quality of the image is badthe quality of the image is badthe quality of the image is badthe quality of the image is bad
4,Fun enjoyable movie.,"Ryan Reynolds does well in whatever he appears. I only viewed the standard DVD and sat back and allowed the movie to be entertaining, which it was."
4,Better then advertised!,I was expecting the worst. This is a nice popcorn flick. Ryan Reynolds has the charm necessary to pull of the role!
2,Not As Creative As The True Green Lantern,"The original Green Lantern and comic books were more creative or his (Hal Jordan's) thoughts. This movie has things created by the Green Lantern Corps's ring to be mainly human thoughts, making it a little disappointing. I recommend trying the Green Lantern first flight animated movie by DC Universe it is much better and truer to the real Green Lantern.Sorry but this major motion picture was a huge disappointment. The movie was just OK."
1,I STILL NOT RECEIVED MY PACKAGE,"I STILL NOT RECEIVED MY PACKAGE. ESTIMATED TIME: NOVEMBER 19TH. STILL NOTHING HERE. ALSO I WROTE TO AMAZON ABOUT THE SUBJECT AND DIDNT HAVE AN ANSWER YET. COME ON, WHERE'S MY BLU RAYS?"
2,Love the movie/Hate UltraViolet,"I really enjoyed the movie and wanted to be able to take the video with me on my I Pad. This is my first experience with Ultra Violet. Sony digital copies are awesome. Ultra violet sucks. Tried following the enclosed instructions and kept getting the message that the website didn't exist. If I'd read reviews, I'd have never ordered the digital copy. I will never again do business with flixter or ultraviolet."
4,Worth watching,Leave out all the critic lingo. This comic flick is worth watching if you like these type of movies.Thats all i have to say about that.
4,actual movie review,"unlike all the 1-stars complaining about a digital copy, i'm rating the movie.it was better than i expected. guess i have to write more words. here they are..."
5,"Movie Editors Are Terrible At Their Jobs, Extended Version Should Have Been The Theatrical Release","The extended version of the Green Lantern is lots of fun and a great action comic book movie. Ryan Reynolds is great in the movie. If there is a sequel, I hope Ryan agrees to do it. I did not see the theatrical version of the Green Lantern. But after seeing the extended version, I can't even imagine seeing a version that is 10 minutes shorter. The extended version of the Green Lantern is a complete movie. Even though I have not seen the theatrical version, it just seems to me that it is a incomplete movie without the extra 10 minutes. I think movie editors are terrible at their jobs. Movie editors really need to think more what scenes are important to leave in and what scenes really are necessary to be cut out of the movie. The 10 extra minutes in the extended version of the Green Lantern movie should never have been cut out for the theatrical version."
1,Great Movie - Digital Rip Off,Ultraviolet is a pure crap Adobe product. This movie is not compatible with anything I(Apple) or even windows media for a crappy second best. This is a total rip-off! by the Blue-Ray.Good movie rip-off Studio bull stuff just like their new anti online piracy which will lock down the internet and let the Government monitor everything you do online.Let's hear it for the 1%'s woo hoo.
1,Ultraviolet Digital Copy ... REAL JUNK DO NOT BUY,"What a load! the Ultraviolet Digital Copy not only requires you to sign up on 2 web sites, It dosen't work and the tech support is all canned responses, no more help than the incorrect package insert. I tried it from 4 computers, XP, Vista and Windows 7. Signed up on both websites and tried to get tech support from both sites.Neither web site was intuitive at all. I will not purchase anything with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy."
1,Ultraviolet Petition,"Okay, first up, the movie gets 3 1/2 stars.The only reason I watched this movie is because I loved GL when I was a kid and now my son wants to see it, so go figure.As far as the movie goes, it all boils down to super intelligent aliens who couldn't figure out something that was so simple.Now down to the Ultraviolet business.There was absolutely nothing wrong with the way the traditional Digital Copy was working for everybody.If something so simple gets way too complicated, I recommend not doing it anymore.I believe the majority has spoken; just scrap the Ultraviolet idea.I dunno, maybe it was Abin Sur's idea in the first place. His skin seemed ""ultraviolet"" to me.Maybe it should have died with him."
2,Good Movie/Bad Digital Copy,"Good movie overall, to be honest there are very few Ryan Reynolds movies that I don't end up liking. My major problem with this movie was as a lot of other people have commented on, the Digital Copy. To download it I had to sign up for 2 seperate accounts (Flixster and Ultraviolet). After finally installing new applications for downloading I got the movie, only to find out it's incompatable with Windows Media Player...it must be played inside of the Flixster application. Just seems like one more way they are making it harder for me to watch movies when I'm traveling."
3,Sillly,Ha Ha I was going to buy this than they made the Green Lantern gay!!! How sillyyyy is that. Cant wait for GL2 mabey he will fly around with a man bag.
1,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid...",Imagine a 3rd rate Men In Black movie starring Van Wilder with sub-par CGI! That's Green Lantern in a nutshell. This movie is the worst movie of 2011. Abysmal on all levels.
1,green lantern three dic combo,i had ordered the three disc combo and got the 3d two disc combo. no regular dvd and no digital copy. as for the movie i really enjoyed it. just wish they would of sent what i had ordered.
3,Future Cult Fav,"I'm not trying to be offensive or get a cheap laugh but this did bother me a bit. To me, Hector Hammond looked like he had down syndrome or some other horrible thing. When you see Ryan Reynolds perfectly handsome character just abusing the crap out of Hector Hammonds body (he's in a wheelchair!) its ridiculous. Which why I'm okay with this movie, its campy without trying to be, which makes a true camp masterpiece. It takes itself seriously to the degree of insanity. It is not a great movie, not by a long shot, and this is not a great lone viewing experience. But have some friends with you and you can have a fun time riffing on the sheer craziness on this film."
1,"GL 1, the main reason there will be no GL 2","This is a weak story, told in a clumsy way. It lacked the fun, wonderment, excitment, action, adventure, comedy, love interest that a super hero film should have. The final showdown (with the bad guy a giant smoky octapus thing...with a human head!) is particularly dreary. Mark Strong (Sinestro) made an impression, and the wonderful Angela Bassett also, even with maybe only four lines. Seems like the ring's power could have been used in more creative and interesting ways. Turning a crashing helicopter into a race car on an elevated track...huh?"
1,REALLY BAD....,"ok, the movie visual effects are amazing...the planets, the aliens...everything is really well done visually....but the story and the green lantern themselves are pathetic....Hal Jordan looks and sounds like a goofy teenager who can't understand what's going on, and all the development is confusing and mediocre...Really bad! Most movies of today got amazing images, but a really poor story...."
1,I just don't get it,Someone please explain to me making kids movies that kids can't watch because they contain profanity (I counted 3 curse words and one middle finger).This movie certainly wasn't for adults because that would require it to make sense and have a plot.
1,What a horrible movie,"I gave up after watching about half of the movie. Hal Jordan is nothing like he is in the comics. Who is this goofy, irresponsible person that becomes Green Lantern and eventually (I assume) learns to be responsible? It was painful to watch, and I had no investment in the characters.Maybe it would have been better if I'd never read the comics, so be warned if you're a geek like me."
1,I feel asleep twice - does that tell you something?,i watched this movie expecting a big pile of crap and boy did I get what I thought it would be. As I mentioned in the title I feel asleep twice and then woke up and watched from where I left off and still I dozed off again. The movie is all special effects and despite the hotness of Ryan Reynolds - even his hot body couldn't keep me wanting to see this pile of crap!
3,...meh...,Comedian Ryan Reynolds saves earth from a bitter handicapped gentleman and the king of the Rastafarians. Yeah... that pretty much sums it up.
4,Awesome movie,"The movie itself is absolutely great! The ""free flixster download"" sucks though. I downloaded it and only got the first seven minutes of the movie! After 4 weeks I sent them another email and they finally responded to me. They're sending out a disk to download the movie (I guess) again. We'll see how it works. Amazon was great though, it shipped fast and they had an awesome sale on Black Friday!!"
4,A good start,It is a little slow at times but that seems to be the way of all of the first run superhero movies. Still a good movie to watch. Waiting for the sequel.
3,Green Mediocre,"Got this at a discount price, and....it's okay. I've been waiting for this one since I got hooked on the comic back in the 1960's, with the wonderful artwork of Gil Kane. Now we have CGI effects that can show anything,and, well, IT'S NOT ENOUGH. Maybe after all along we just have to face up to the fact that certain comic book characters should just stay in the comic books (HULK, for instance) and give up on hitting the big screen."
3,Ok but not really much of a 3D release.,"The 3D disc included with this is pretty much worthless as far as actual 3D content and the fact it's only the theatrical release. I've yet to watch the extended release in 2D but will soon. Also, the Digital copy is pure BS! Shame...Unless you're a diehard 3D fan, skip this version."
4,Really Good!,"Like a few people mentioned before me, I don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie all that much. I thought it was pretty cool! I'm familiar enough with Green Lantern to know, though, that a few things were off about it, but a lot of it was dead on, and while I thought they could have done a bit more with this movie, it was still really cool. Don't let any negative comments deter you from checking this one out. If you like superhero movies & sci-fi & such, you oughta be right at home with this movie."
3,Half Decent,The movie is half decent at best.. Green lantern was probably not the best choice or a super hero seeing how some people (maybe most) Don't know to much about him... Its not like hes really interesting enough to actually care. Another thing is that most people who do know of the green lantern watched shows like static shock or the justice league unlimited and saw the other green lantern which is basically what i grew up seeing.. As far as the movie go it is ok.. I don't know why Hollywood feels the need to put unnecessary situations in a movie.. That's one of the main reasons that transformers is so bad. Its supposed to be for children but no something i would ever let a child watch (regarding transformers). That's one reason why so many of these movies actually flop cause u cant take your child to the movies to actually see it. Even superhero movies now a days have to be screened... smh...
4,he is awesome i like it that is all,"muito bom gostei do filme, dos efeitos e principalmente do ator principal ele e bonito e imprimiu um tom comico bem interessante."
1,"Very ""meh""","The special effects are good, and the acting is good. But the storyline feels generic, and the dialogue suffers the same. After awhile I began skipping ahead a lot, just to see the predictable ending. There are enough films with great special effects, and good acting, so I cannot recommend anyone spend the time or money watching this."
3,It was ok,"There were parts of this movie that were good, but it didn't really do much for me. I liked Thor and Captain America much more than this movie. The acting and stories were better in both of those movies with Thor being my favorite for this year. The actors in Thor really fit their parts. Green Lantern seemed juvenille."
3,Go green,"Through a quirk of fate test pilot Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is chosen against his better judgment to save the world and maybe the universe form a being, don't laugh, and named Parallax that lives for fear.As with all comic to big screen transformations the restrictions to conforming to the comic books shackles any potential for a good movie. The graphics look hokey but better than not. They could have zipped him up in a green fuzzy suit.The story is generic the god guys and bad buys are also generic. You could make book on the dialog. And the pattern is so obvious that they did not waste any time with twist or turn surprises. This was designed to be a pilot (no pun intended.)The film passed time but would not thrill any comic fans or generic movie watchers."
4,Great movie but the UltraViolet Digital Copy is very misleading,"UltraViolet Digital Copy is not a digital copy, but a way to stream the content to devices other than what you really want. Avoid spending extra money on this package and buy the DVD or Blu Ray on its own."
1,DIgital Copy not allowed on iTunes ruined this release!,"Just like other reviewers the Digital Copy of this release is the WORST experience ever! You can't just download it to iTunes like almost all other digital copies. You have to go through this nightmare of setting up an account with flixter in order to stream to your phone or tablet device. Then when it gives you the option to download to your computer you have to download some adobe flash junk and it still does not allow you to move to iTunes. You have to log in to flixter to view it. I enjoyed the movie and the blu-ray looks and sounds great, but I am sending a clear message to the studio with my 1 star review. They need to include a iTunes digital copy not some hot mess release like this. When we pay extra for the digital copy we expect to work as it always has. So sad what could have been a 4 or 5 star review was messed up due to the HORRIBLE digital copy included on this."
1,THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE DIGITAL COPY PLEASE READ!!!!!!!,Now I am a big fan of the green lantern movie however the Digital Copy is an ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY and for those of you who bought Horrible bosses and your digital copy didnt work on itunes and if you used it on the app then you will notice the quality is poor!!!!!!!!!! The same ultraviolet digital copy is going to be available for this movie so if you want to save yourself a hassle and some money get just the DVD or BLURAY editions!!!!! I promise its not worth it!!!!
1,Digital Copy a big disappointment,One of the reasons why I buy these Blu-ray combos is the digital copy (for use with my iTunes library and Apple TV) and imagine my disappointment when I realized that the only way you could view the digital copy without streaming via the internet was to download the Flixter application and then on top of that when I tried to view the movie using Flixter (what a ugly piece of software to use) it crashed multiple times to the point where I eventually gave it up as a bad job. So now I have one lonely movie sitting out in Never Land and the rest of my collection in iTunes.
1,Buyer Beware - Not A TRUE Digital Copy,"This review is based on the package for sale, rather than the movie quality. The package comes with an ""UltraViolet Digital Copy."" What does that mean? It means you will not be able to take the movie with you on your digital devices - you will have to stream it to them whenever you want to watch them. You better have wi-fi or have an unlimited data plan to do that! You can download the movie on your computer, and there it will sit trapped.Had I known it was like this, I would not have paid the extra money for the set with ""digital copy."" I believe a digital copy is something I can take with me (a copy) on my digital devices without having to stream them each time I want to watch them. And I also was not happy that I had to download two separate programs to even be able to download the movie to my computer. I will never purchase a set with ""UtraViolet"" again."
1,"Enjoyed the Movie, Ultraviolet Digital Copy Sucks","My wife and I enjoyed the movie (3 - 4 star), but the Ultraviolet Digital Copy Sucks. It will not work on my HTC Inspire and half the time my copy is not showing on the Flixster website. Hopefully, the new Harry Potter 3D Blu-ray at Best Buy will not have an Ultraviolet Digital Copy. If it does, I might have to pass on buying and just renting the 2D version."
1,Don't pay extra for the digital copy!,The Flixster digital copy was difficult to redeem and I still can't get it to play on my laptop. Don't waste your money for the digital copy. I will never buy another digital copy redeemable only with Flikster. If the digital copy isn't ITunes don't waste your time.
5,Green Lantern DVD,Item received in excellent condition from seller and on time. This movie was a delightful and entertaining experience. Ryan Renolds does an outstanding job. Can't wait for the next movie to come out. I am sure it will be exciting also. You must see to appreciate it.
1,Digital Copy - Not Really,"I always make it a point to buy discs that include a digital copy that I can import into iTunes and take with me on the road. If this is also what you do, DO NOT BUY THIS DISC. Their ""UltraViolet"" digital copy is only available via Flixster and there is NO WAY to import the movie into your existing iTunes library. I'll never buy another disc with the UltraViolet so called ""digital copy"". Be warned."
1,Why so many previews?,I have yet to get to the movie. This DVD is forcing me to watch 13 minutes of 45 seconds of previews before I get access to the menu. Very annoying.
5,Awesome Movie,They did an excellent job with the storyline. Action sequences are great. The flow of the movie was great-made sense and no awkward jumps from original
4,good story horrible directing,"good adventure/action parts, did u see after some credits how the red guy used the yellow ring/weapon. To set up a sequel."
1,Made by Someone Who Doesn't Get Green Lantern,"Everything is wrong with this movie. It's SUPER SERIOUS like one of the new Nolan ""Batman"" movies. Then the Green Lantern uses his powers and it's very silly, like something from ""Roger Rabbit."" A runaway helicopter is settled onto a racecar and a track built in mid-air for it to run along. To fight a giant monster cloud, he boosts up a fuel truck on giant springs and then shoots it with an anti-aircraft gun. A number of the visuals and science feel borrowed from Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" while there are story references to the original ""Superman."" In ""Superman,"" though, you know the director really loved the comic book. In ""Green Lantern,"" everything feels like they were worried people would think the Green Lantern mythology was too silly and outer space, so they just tried to make it as realistic as possible and never embraced the big cosmic themes and feel.""Superman,"" it is not."
2,Ultraviolet Digital Copy doesn't fly,"Amazon's listing for this title is ""Green Lantern (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)"". I don't remember the 'Ultraviolet' being in the listing when I placed my order. In any case, if you read the specifications, this is not a Three-Disc product, there are only two discs in the package and accessing the digital copy requires ""an Ultraviolet account and a Flixster account"". I don't need any more accounts floating around in the cloud so the digital copy is a non-starter for me."
1,Not even the cgi are are worth it,"Good,It is not that long.Bad,Everything else.The movie lacks in so many aspects that is difficult where to start, possible the worst superhero movie since daredevil."
1,"Terrible, Terrible",One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Story was choppy. Characters and storyline undeveloped.What a waste of film.
3,I enjoyed but it wasn't great,"I am glad I waited until this came out on Blue-ray. Ryan Reynolds did a good job but the story was ""choppy"". I am not sure if it was a bad editing job or the screenwriter was not a very good story teller. This movie had so much potential but up against the other super hero stories/movies it was my least favorite."
3,It's a comic,"You need to take this movie as it is a comic book. Having a Green Lantern flying a spaceship when he really does not need it was inconsistent, seemed out of place at the beginning of the movie. I found the parts that try to build the story between him and Ferris daughter not needed. If you into super hero movies it's not bad."
2,One of the best first 10 minutes of recent movies..,"and.... then Ryan Reynolds showed up. The CG, music, and composition of the first 10 minutes of the movie had a build up that had me off my seats wanting to yell ""woot"". Then intro Reynolds and I could help think that he's going to have to dig deeper to give us a compelling character in this (and his other) movies to make him memorable."
2,Dang! Another Disappointment!,"If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it comes awfully close. Predictable to the point of cliche. Decent (but not great) effects. Not a single surprise. So-so soundtrack. I haven't been so disappointed in a movie since ""the incredible hulk"" was previewed when the first Spiderman came out. Best part about the movie on demand is that I was able to resist instance purchase for 14.99 and go with the 24 hr. rental. I saved eleven bucks! Woo hoo!"
4,enjoyable,"good comic book action flick. i'm not sure what WB promised with the UltraViolet copy, but I mainly stream these days. users should really email WB and complain, rather than rate the movie based on WB's actions. that's like rating it 1 star, because you haven't seen the movie, because you can't get it for some reason. kinda annoying."
4,Green Lantern Rocks,"I have to admit I did not know what to expect after reading so mamy negative things about this movie. I have to say I really enjoyed it. Ryan Reynolds does a very good job of playing the super hero. The special effects are awesome but does not overtake the characters. GL may not be as famous as Superman, Iron Man, etc....but still an enjoyable film...Be sure to watch after the credits at the end begin to roll...As it seems to be more, a scene to suggest a sequel. I can't wait....Also the packaging for this, the steel box, is cool and it has some great extras."
4,Good silly movie,"This is popcorn movie. Silly and certainly not the best sic-fi I have seen lately. Four stars because it can be viewed by the family, it does have a story line, and it does kind of follow the original comic book. Don't expect great graphics, but do expect a fun movie."
1,dont waste your time,Ryan Reynolds' performance is terrible and the story has more holes than Swiss cheese. If you're over the age of 15 don't waste your time. This is the worst superhero movie I have ever watched. The first hulk movie with eric bana is better than this.
3,:0/,"I'm not a huge green lantern fan, but I have watch enough of the cartoon to know this could have been better. I am a huge Ryan Renolds fan and was expecting to see more of his humorous side, granted that's not how the green lantern is. As for the movie it's not bad but it's not great either. As fun as it is to see these comic books come to life, you've seen one you've seen them all when they decide to make as a movie, nothing new that wow me. But I did liked it."
2,Lame plot,"A Green Lantern movie was a great idea! Crafting the plot as a boring soap opera about the Green Lantern Corps was not. What a dull, cliched bunch of characters. The writers should have skipped the Corps entirely and just focused on Hal and the origin story: getting the ring, learning to use it, and triumphing over evil. Sigh...."
3,Disappointing,"My wife and I love the comic book movies, but unfortunately this one fell far from the tree. The graphics were OK and so was the action, but there seemed to be no development and kind of bounced around."
3,What's Wrong With The Movie,"The problem with this movie is that they tried to cram to much into one movie. The movie seems disjointed. First, you should stick to one villan. This movie had both Hector Hammond and Parallax in the movie. Second, why do they kill off the villans in the first movie?In the comics the Guardians and Oa were only a small part of the story initially. Hal received ""orders"" through his Lamp. Nothing was mentioned of 24 hour limit of his ring and they certainly never made clear that the ring had no effect on anything yellow. Two critical limitations were not even mentioned or used in the plot. As we saw in Batman-The Dark Knight, story and plot are much more important than special effects. If there is a sequel to this movie, they need to get better writers to make it worthwhile seeing."
1,"Ultraviolet digital copy, no customer support",I have emailed flixter several times since the beginning of the year and no response. I will therefore try to make my voice heard here. Avoid any ultraviolet product like the plague. Difficult to use and terrible customer support.
1,"Movie was ok, streaming delivery was awful","I rented this movie from Amazon Prime. I won't be doing that again anytime soon. The sound constantly cut out, ruining the movie experience. It wasn't my TV or my stereo - both of those were perfectly capable of showing other shows and movies before and after this one just fine. But for whatever reason, Amazon Prime had significant sound issues.Bleah."
3,Green Lantern two disc blu-ray,i don't like the story but i like Green Lantern. i very upset with ending so very quick don't have a nice conflik. but i enjoy this transfer very fantastic also this sound. if you fans the green so get it. maybe the sequel makes better than first.
1,NOT GOOD,"Couldn't finish watching this CG craptactular. I wanted to like this, like the comic, like sci-fi, this just didn't work. ..and the special effects, not good at all, maybe they were better in 3D but at home, terrible."
5,Good price for a good movie!,Good price and speedy service obtaining the movie... Amazon rocks it with the deals. While I don't expect an Academy for this movie... It's a fun movie to watch and something you can watch over and over.
1,what was DC thinking?,"This movie was a major disappointment to me.I'm still waiting for DC/Warner Brothers to get this super hero movie translation right.I'll give them the new Batman movies but, they've done so many in the past it was about time they got something right. Superman was a decent movie but that was THIRTY something years ago. This movie was doomed by bad special effects (especially the costume), terrible dialogue , unbelievable actors, and too many cliche' cheesey moments that were almost embarrassing.Come on DC, Marvel is beating the pants off of you at the theater, I just watched Captain America, now there's a super hero movie.With the Avengers due next May DC better pull a Crisis in Infinite Theaters quick or they'll never get it right. (and I hope they do, I'd love to see a decent JLA movie!!!"
1,wanted to buy it...but,"this ultra voilet digital copy crap isnt something im interested in at all.i put my digital copies in iTunes because its convenient for ME. i do NOT care what any other company wants or that they dont like apple or whatever the issue is.i dont use the ""cloud"" either its all bs if you ask me.just give us our regular digital copies and stop trying to make us sign up for extra stuff we dont want ffs."
2,"OK movie, but digital copy was misleading","The digital copy bit was misleading. Ultraviolet Digital copy is not like most of the digital copy. It does not download into iTunes. Its basically streaming from Flixster's site. You cannot watch this on your iPad or iPhone without an internet connection and installing the Flixster app.The movie itself made good use of 3D effects, but suffered from a common problem of trying to stuff a universe of comic book awesomeness into a limited time."
1,This movie is absolutely terrible,"Horrible. The effects are terrible, Ryan Reynolds is dead wrong for the part, Blake Lively's performance is embarrassing, and most of all --this movie is so stupid, everyone involved with it should be ashamed.Paul Sheer, the comedian said it well: ""Watching the Green Lantern movie is like being cornered at a party by a horrible Green Lantern fan as he explains Green Lantern to you for three hours, mouth breathing Cheetos breath in your face.""EVERYONE at DC Comics and Warners who's responsible for this debacle should be fired. Marvel is making The Avengers, DC/Warners is firing Joss Whedon from Wonder Woman and making this 250 million dollar turd. Fire them all."
4,Underrated and Over Scrutinized,"Some people who hate on this film obviously couldn't suspend their disbelief long enough to enjoy it. It's not the greatest DC hero, but the outer space sequences were really cool, especially in 3D, and Ryan Reynolds' suit effects were cool to see glimmer as he stood with the Core. The final battle may have been weak, but I'm sure they were hoping to set up sequels with larger battles ala Star Wars or other space opera. Hopefully they won't give up on this franchise, it would be a great way to see other cosmic DC heroes show up in later sequels."
1,Cheapo!!!,"I paid for a BluRay, DVD combo 2 disc set and I got just a plain BluRay set. No DVD or Digital copy for travel. I should have bought it at Walmart, then I would have gotten what I wanted"
2,WB does it again...UltraViolet Disappoints,"SSDD...I though WB learned that a digital copy that went no where was a bad idea - but no - Their initial digital copies are still unwatched in their very own little folder on my computer. I've had NOTHING but trouble with UV/Flixter and getting the product downloaded to start with and then what? Disrespecting the consumer; not nice! The Green Lantern is delightful for a comic book movie - I need the laughs! How sad this is my last thought, not the first."
3,Enjoyable Movie but BEWARE Digital Copy,"Unlike earlier movies, the digital copy that comes with this one cannot be downloaded to iTunes. Instead you have to install a new application (Flixster Collections), set up two new Web accounts (with Flixster and Ultraviolet) and download the movie to that instead. This means you can't copy your movie onto your iPhone or iPad until new apps are available for those. Very annoying. I'm guessing this is WB effort to get Apple out of the loop but from a consumer perspective its a bad move that requires you to use multiple incompatible applications to manage your digital media collection and limits its use. I won't be buying any more BD+Digital Copy discs until this is reversed."
1,Not really a digital copy...,"This is being falsely advertised in my opinion. The Ultraviolet digital copy only lets you stream the movie using wifi to your devices and after signing up for two different services. Worst thing is that you cannot use the movie with itunes and to watch it on an iPad or iPhone you need to be connected through wifi. 3G is just not enough to be able to watch it (in fact, it says you need to connect to a wifi source to watch) and, at least for me, makes the purported digital copy basically worthless. You therefore can't watch, for example, in an airplane or while driving to keep the kids occupied. If I am connected at home I'll use the dvd or blue ray. Basically paid way to much for something I'll never use."
1,Terrible Digitai Switch,"OK, movie is great. The ""Ultraviolet"" digital copy is is not in the sense that you must use a format from another source with a different player. No Itunes or Windows format!"
1,DIGITAL COPY RIP OFF NO iTunes!!!,"YOU CAN NOT DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE TO ITUNES!!!!!!!!!!! This movie can only be downloaded into Flixster and NOT iTunes. You will be required to create accounts with Flixter and Ultraviolet, required to link the accounts so each service can share all information they have about you with each other as well as Warner Brothers."
5,"GREAT MOVIE !!! Effects plot, sound.......","All I can say is WOW WHAT A GREAT GREAT MOVIE. Super entertIning.....BTW, need a good surround sys to really appreciate. Have fun with this one!"
3,It's not the Dark Knight but it is underated,"Green Lantern's first voyage into the silver screen was highly expected. It didn't deliver to these expectations since it's financial performance was not what the producers had expected given the fact that the GL comic enjoys one of it's greatest times!Personally speaking, i found the film quite enterntaining. It was filled with impressive space settings, the effects were good and Ryan Reynolds was enjoyable. I do spotted some flaws to the script and the mediocre performances of the rest of the cast (especially the one who portrayed the main villain)but if i remember other monstrocities such as Shumacher's Batman flicks and the Ghost Rider movie, then i would say that GL was a good movie by all means!Of course the criterias are obsective but i would safely recommend to give GL a chance!"
2,C-Grade Movie for B-List Superhero,"Martin Campbell knows how to deliver the action-adventure goods, but 2011's ""Green Lantern"" remains among his lesser efforts. Simply put, it's hard to get worked up about a B-list superhero. Apart from some impressive visuals, the filmmakers display little enthusiasm for the uninspired material. Several fine actors and millions of dollars go to waste. Perhaps Warner Bros. can spend its money on a stronger DC character such as The Spectre."
3,"Movie big time popcorn, no pop","I've been a Green Lantern since I was able to turn pages of a comic book, no idea how DC thought this actorwas Hal Jordan. No depth to the characters, it was all about the CGI, hence why it failed at the movies. Just can't believethey did what they did, GL could have launched the JLA like Iron Man had done for the Avengers. Oh well.. reboot time."
1,AVOID ULTRAVIOLET AT ALL CAUSE......,"I'll never buy a bluray disc with Ultraviolet Copy. Its a rip off.You thought your buying a digital copy but in reality you are just renting it.Warner Brothers is fooling you to think that's its accessible and easybut all they care about is for you to pay for the same movie over andover again...After you dowload the movie several times your out of luck.Typical consumers like me, You've been warned. Don't be fooled by Ultraviolet..."
1,"Can't download ""digital Copy"" Green Lantern","The movie is very good. However the ultraviolet/Flixster digital copy system is so poorly designed that it useless. It is unnecessarily complicated You cannot download a permanent copy to any device. Steaming is ok but you rack up charges on your data limits. As said, it is not iTunes compatible. I will not purchase any movie with this system again"
1,Digital Copy --- Rip Off,"I purchased this DVD/BluRay/Digital copy to get the best off all worlds - Guess what the digital copy is a fake and you can't down load it ""UltraViolet Digital"" is a fake - Don't waste your money!!!"
1,"Beware ""Digital Copy"" not downloadable to your IPod","The Ultraviolet digital copy cannot be downloaded to your iPod. Instead they force you to create a flixster account, download flixster software and view the ""downloadable"" copy from there. Any viewing from your iphone, ipad or droid means you must _stream_ the video to the device, not play it from a downloaded file. So if you are on an airplane or in a car and want to watch the movie, you are out of luck. If you do have cell access, well you will be using up your allotted bandwidth very quickly with a streaming movie. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of having a digital copy. Rated one star for the ""digital copy"" ripoff."
1,Do not buy if you want the digital copy,The Ultraviolet Digital Copy that comes with the move is horrible. It requires you to create 2 accounts (one on Ultraviolet/ one on flixster). Ultraviolet only provides streaming and flixster only lets you download to a device (will not download to itunes). My opinion is that everyone should boycott buying dvd/blue ray movies with Ultraviolet digital copies.
3,Comic Book Movie Lover,"I'm an old (50ish) comic book movie lover. This movie was visually satisfying, but, lacked a pull at the heart. Would have liked to connect better with the characters, even if they are extra-terrestial and super powered."
4,Fun movie,"Some of the story was a bit far fetched... but it is fiction. Still fun, great costumes, and very attractive cast!"
2,Why so many Ultraviolet Digital Copy in Warner movies?,"How many Ultraviolet copies I will have in my blu ray collection? Why give this digital copy in so many different Warner movies? This strategie is failed, just look at the thousands of customers feedback."
2,Below Average,"Cartoony and doesn't really takes off. No sense of adventure nor danger to the protagonist. His Ring/Power makes every attack and counterattack or defense like a cartoon, yet the Warner Bros cartoons does it better and with more wit.Blake Lively is so one-dimensional and forgettable.The movie has dull dialogue interspersed with loud sounds to try and keep you awake: Not successfully, because I keep falling asleep and had to watch this movie in 3 sessions. Don't buy this one at full price."
2,Overall a poor introduction to the character,"This should have been so much better. all of the scenes that happened in space were well done and enjoyable, but the movie deflated every time the story returned to Earth. The writing was bad, and the effects budget seemed misplaced. Why was the villain a giant cloud monster? We've already seen how poorly that worked with Galactus in FF. Why did the scene with the helicopter take up so much time when it was so lame? Why was there wind in space?Save your money and watch Thor or Captain America again, or wait for the Dark Knight Rises to hit theaters this summer. DC really needs to take some lessons from how Marvel has been handling their movies, or at least reference their own playbook on what has made the Batman movies so successful since Nolan took over."
1,Decepcion por Copia Digital,"Hago este review no de la pelicula, sino de la frustración por la copia digital que viene en la misma. Sucede que la copia se obtiene a través de Flixster, y resulta que está disponible solo para Estados Unidos. Qué pasa con todas las personas del resto del mundo? Simplemente perdemos nuestra copia? Considero que si nosotros tomamos la molestia de comprar una película original, esperando tener la copia digital, deberían de tomarnos en cuenta para la promoción. Esto realmente decepciona."
2,poor,Bad is what this is wait to see it free because its not even worth the price of the rental. I warned you
3,Not what you are expecting,"The comics fans were expecting something different (I don't know what, I don't read comics), I saw Ryan Reynolds and was expecting more comedy (like Seth Rogan in Green Hornet), but this film is really neither. Ryan did an excellent job of displaying his skills as an actor, and you did see a LITTLE of his more familiar style, but his role was more serious than I expected.If you set aside your expectations and watch the film for itself, its pretty good. The effects look great, the acting is good, it has its humorous moments, and the storyline flows nicely into an open ending that begs for a sequel that will probably never be made (due to a lack of success of the first one). I myself will be sad if I do not get to see Ryan in this role again.As others have said, it just doesn't stack up next to Marvel's line this summer, but I did not walk away feeling I had wasted my afternoon."
1,"Loved the movie, got screwed by Ultraviolet! Agree with other reviews...","I loved this movie, but like most of the other reviewers, the false advertisement of a ""Digital Copy"" needs to stop.I have gotten accustomed to buying Blu-rays that include the digital copy so I can put them on my iPhone and watch them while flying on trips. Well, that isn't going to happen because it's not compatible with iPhone/iPad/etc and has to connect to the Internet...HELLO!!!Gargbage! Do not buy one of these!!!"
3,Lantern,"Ryan Reynolds is good in this movie, but I expected a little more action and drama. Takes awhile for the story line to set and get to the whole story line."
1,It's awful...,"This movie was horrible. I can't believe I watched it. I don't think Hollywood realizes no one wants to see a bunch of special effects, a ""fluff"" script with no real story-line, and mis-cast/ cocky actors giving weak, garbage performances. It didn't even flow right and the editing was terrible. It was all over the place, and really a bit obnoxious. Based on this version, I still don't understand how or why Hal Jordan was chosen to be the Green Lantern? With the budget they had, I can't believe they couldn't make a more intelligent and creative movie. The Green Lantern(s) character has been around for over 70 years!-- come on! Thank goodness I didn't spend any real money to watch it-- it was on a free preview weekend on TV."
2,i collect super hero movies,even tho it was a okay shot of the Green lantern super hero the movie was weak but i am a super hero fan so i got it .
4,"I liked it,fun movie","It starts off quick ,but then slows down. I did enjoy it. I liked how it gave the green lantern history up front so anyone could watch and understand"
2,BAD,"Surprisingly bad. I think this may be the first time I've given only two stars on anything. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing, although I tried. This was all over the place. A Green Lantern movie was a good idea, but I'm not sure what went wrong here. Although I couldn't give the movie a good review, I was pleased with packaging and quick delivery of this product and give five stars for that."
1,Flixster/Ultraviolet is horrible!,"I agree with everyone else on this horrible service, I've noticed there is at least one other movie out there with the same stupid digital download. I believe it's the new Harry Potter movie. I don't like when I pay for something and then having the need to create multiple accounts for a service I actually refuse to use. I already have more online accounts than I need and have zero interest in signing up for a random service that might only be around for a short period of time. I really hope Flixster/Ultraviolet dies a quick death."
2,Ouch.,"I place this movie somewhere in between Superman Returns and Catwoman. It is not the worst movie that DC has put out, but it is close. The special effects on this film are mostly special and not very effective. The writing is on par with that of Superman Returns. That being said expect some bad romance to get in the way of your hard hitting action adventure. I will say that the movie did have some fun (though completely transparent) characters that kids can enjoy. The Blu Ray itself highlights some of the more obvious visual effect flaws with the film including the in ability to create an environment that allowed ""real life"" and CGI to look good together. All and all this Blu ray gets a 4/10. (or 2 stars so says amazon!"
1,Warning about Warner Brothers Digital Copy of Green Lantern,"This movie can only be downloaded into Flixster and NOT iTunes. You will be required to create accounts with Flixter and Ultraviolet, required to link the accounts so each service can share all information they have about you with each other as well as Warner Brothers.Before downloading, you are required to download and install the Flixster Collections App and Adobe Air.They are more than happy to let you watch as many times as you want by streaming the video, but then you have to burn through minutes on your data plan everytime you are not connected to Wi-Fi. Why should we have to pay to watch a movie again and again when you already own.I'm not doing anything on any clouds from Apple or anyone else, its ridiculous. It is also the last time I buy a Warner Brothers movie with digital copy from Amazon. I will also be carefully watching to see if and when digital copies from other studies are released on Ultraviolet."
3,Fun Movie But Lacking in Plot,"Recently, I just watched this film, which was okay and can be enjoyable. But it was not as great as I would like it to be, and it's almost mindless. I felt that this film was too ""rushed"" and the plot wasn't carefully done. It, however, has that CGI thing going on with alot to see (which seems to be the good thing about this movie, if not only).After having been a collector of ""Green Lantern"" comic books as a kid myself, this film is slightly a disappointment because it doesn't really live up to the lore."
3,3.5 Stars - I enjoyed it.,"I saw this on Cinemax the other day and was kinda ticked that the critics kept me from going to see this movie in the theater. I actually really enjoyed Ryan Reynolds as Hal Jordan. The plot was decent and the characters and action sequences were great. Overall, a much better movie than the critics made it out to be. The critics may have single handedly destroyed any chance of a Justice League movie."
3,Something to rent for the kids,"Decent, probably more fun and entertaining for the kids. Ryan Reynolds does an awesome job bringing his style of humor to the role of the Green Lantern. Ultimately though I don't think anyone can make the Green Lantern cool. I've seen worse, this isn't it, but don't expect to be blown away either. Worth a rent for the kids."
1,Avoid Ultraviolet Digital Copy Version!!!!!,"This review does not relate to the movie, but it is focused on the ridiculous process to download the digital copy. After creating accounts for both Flixster and Ultraviolet, linking the accounts, enabling WB to view my personal information, the system hangs and doesn't download the movie. I contacted Ultraviolet first with the issues and error messages. After a day, I was told this is not an Ultraviolet issue, but a Flixster problem. I then contacted Flixster. They responded by sending me to the FAQ. To date, I have not gotten a proper response from Flixster on the error messages. I plan on canceling both accounts and will NEVER buy another DVD tied to Ultraviolet. This is a complete rip off and WB should be ashamed of this dreadful service. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy the movie with the digital copy. If you want a digital version, just got to iTunes."
1,Digital copy fraud,"The product was advertised as including a digital copy. What it actually includes is a requirement to enrole in both Flixster and UltraViolet. After 45 minutes to sign up, install software, and download the movie it becomes clear that what is provided is a proprietary player/streamer that does not work withiTunes or other media players. Beware.Green Lantern (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy)"
4,"Good movie, BAD Digital copy","I bought the blu ray/ dvd/ ultra violet digital copy only to figure out I cant put the movie on my Ipad to watch when Im away from home. This is stupid and a BIG mistake. I can only hope other companies keep the BETTER digital copy that I can put on my Ipad to watch. HOWEVER as for the movie I would still say go out and buy it, it looks great on Blu Ray."
2,Green Lantern (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy) (2011),Really NOT liking this UltraViolet Digital Copy thing. It downloaded so that I can only view it on my PC with Adobde Air. Can't get it onto any iPad or iPhone or iAnything !
1,Ultraviolet? Don't waste your money.,"The movie's fine. Liked it in the theater, still like it now. But the new Ultraviolet digital copy? Useless. I don't want yet another cloud service. I want to own my digital copy, that works with my movie library that I already have, on the computer i already have. Awful, awful Hollywood move."
3,Fun but flawed,Fun but flawed. Pretty much everything that works is balanced by something that doesn't. Some of it works pretty well and I did like how casually competent the CGI is. Even when my interest in the story sagged there was often cool stuff to look at.The standout performer is Peter Sarsgaard who gives his character a lot more nuance and flavor than anyone else in the movie - he's fun to watch until the makeup starts getting in the way.
5,Green Lantern,The Movie was great I truly enjoyed it. My family also loved it too. I had a problem in the being . My son got it to work.
1,Ultraviolet what??? No iTunes folks,"I am so upset, got this movie and it said digital copy, well that digital copy is not iTunes compatible is for some knock off service called ultraviolet I feel dipped and ripped off, this movie is getting returned."
1,Ultraviolet is not your own digital copy,"Boycott Ultraviolet. Without this being compatible with iTunes, it is not a truly ""digital copy"". I will only buy digital copies that come with a iTunes redemption code. That way all my devices can share the movie and I can watch wherever I want, even Apple TV."
5,Green lantern dvd,"This is a very good movie. Lots of action,great story and caracters.Funny and serious parts.Ryan is awesome.Great effects through out."
2,Love Ryan Reynolds but story line was weak.,"Weak story line, even with smart, funny lines, classic Ryan Reynolds not even the shirtless scenes could save this. Watch it on cable when available."
2,Lame,"I may not be qualified to speak about Green Lantern since I feel asleep for half an hour in the middle of the movie. But that says quite a bit in itself, because I have a high tolerance for terrible movies. I'll give Green Lantern credit for having one of the best lines ever uttered in a superhero film:What do you mean? I've known you my whole life! I've seen you naked! You don't think I would recognize you because I can't see your cheekbones?Of course, it is said by Blake Lively as Carol Ferris, ace fighter pilot and successful business woman. Blake tries her hardest, but she's not very convincing as the tough-as-nails Carol. She comes off as a bit of a marshmallow. As for the central character . . . Hal Jordan has never been my favorite Lantern. And the movie takes way too long to make Hal seem like a good candidate for the ring. As for the daddy issues everyone in the film is suffering from: Iron Man did it better."
3,green lantern,"I have nothing against the movie Green Lantern but I think the ""digital copy"" is a joke and not a very funny joke. In the future I will avoid buying any movie associated with the ultraviolet digital copy. It does not run well and I have to be connected to the internet to access it. What about when you are traveling in a car or on a plane and want to watch a movie. It is useless."
3,ultra violet copy worthless,"okay movie ultra violet waste of time, will not buy another dvd with it, will not make mistake again in future"
5,WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING?,"Yeah, there may have been room for improvement - I've read Green Lantern since I was a kid ( 60's - 70's ) and fully enjoyed the movie. It was comic book to film .... what were you dinks looking for? It worked well. Looking forward to more of the same. Quality comic book, balls to the wall, action packed adaptations."
5,One word: EPIC,"This movie was fantastic. Some people say that it should have been longer, and I aggree, im new to the Green Lantern, but I must say due to the movie I will be reading more into it. This movie is amazing, i hope and pray they make a Green Lantern II. They really need to you. I would watch this over and over again.Character development was pretty good, although I wished they wouldve had more scenes on the Green Lantern planet (yes i know i forgot the green lantern planet name) but all in all i highly recommend this movie!@i_bewill"
1,I love the movie but the what is up with the picture on this release?,"OK, I really enjoyed this movie and saw it twice while in the theatre. Now, the BD and DVD release are HORRIBLE. The picture is extremely dark. I do not know if not was authored this way or if it is defective. It was NOT like this in the theatre. I cannot recommend this release to anyone until they fix the picture issue."
2,Mediocre super hero,This was an ok movie strictly for kids. There were too many dark scenes where I couldn't even see what was going on. The villian was one of the silliest comic book villian concepts I've ever seen. Angela Bassett must have badly needed the money to take on the do nothing hardly say anything role that she played.
4,Green Lantern better than expected,I was tempted to buy this when it first came out but because it received mixed reviews I decided to save my money. I received it as a gift for Christmas and after watching I enjoyed it more than I expected to. I think the movie was well done and I look forward to a 2nd movie if it happens.
1,DVD did not work properly,I received it quickly however I will update my review because I am in the process of returning the DVD
3,3 Stars,"The special effects are good. Let's just say the reviews for this movie were pretty darn accurate, but still if you grew up reading the Green Lantern comics you will want to watch it at least once."
3,Decent but not best,"I enjoyed the majority of this movie. I usually don't have an opinion about casting directors choices of actors, but I do believe a different person in the role of Hector would have made for a better movie overall. The screaming sections where Hector was changing - well, I can just say that when I re-watch this movie, I fast forward through those scenes because I get tired of hearing him scream like that."
2,cheap special effects,"green latern was the passion of my soul, until that one seen when he saved man kind! the movie stunk like my dad's socks after he's done the yard work! the person who ever thought of green latern was a complete kook. I FEEL LIKE HE HAD NO TALENT WHAT SO EVER"
1,No real digital copy,"have to join the chorus of other s- you don't get a real digital copy of the movie. In order to get your ""digital copy"" you have to sign up for 2 different services; agree to a dozen pages of legal agreements that take away your rights to anything; hand over personal information, then install multiple additional applications on your computer in order to watch this movie. Oh, and after paying for a high def blu ray movie, you only get a standard def download/access What a load of BS. The blu ray plays fine, but don't expect that you're actually getting a digital download of anything..."
2,"Movie was Great, however...","I loved the movie it was great, but I bought the three pack,Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy, because that is what I wanted. The fact that I can't use MY digital copy on all MY devices, really fracks me off. Just rude and really upsetting of the company to pull such an underhanded move."
4,Loved it,"I did enjoy the movie, and while it could have been longer to allow for more character development, it was worth watching."
1,Digital copy does not work with iTunes,"Ultraviloet is a rip off you cannot load it into iTunes. This needs to be addressed. When we pay for a digital copy it should be a digital copy and not some crackpot company trying to push their software on you, just because they don't like apple."
3,Good Movie..... Kids will Love It !!!!,I'm a HUGE comic fan. Grew up reading them and still love them. I used to read the JLA and was a fan of Green Lantern. I think this movie does a good job of showing the different Lanterns and Hal's story. I hope they make another one
2,UltraViolet Digital Copy,"This review is for the UltraViolet digital copy only. Is it a digital copy? Yes. Can you download it to iTunes? No. You have to install yet another video player on your PC, like I don't enough with iTunes, WMC, WMP, and PowerDVD. Now I need another one for another proprietary format like Roxio for Best Buy's Cinema Now. Plus over Cinema Now is you can stream it your Apple gear, but let's get with it movie studios. Bluray won, Apple won, deal with it and give us uniform formats. I hope WB doesn't do this to Deathly Hollows Part 2."
3,Green Lantern,"just saw this movie today at the cinema in 3-D. The actors were fine, the special effects in 3-D was the main selling point for me, and did not disappoint. Movies like this are best viewed at the cinema and in 3-D. You would lose something in the experience to watch an action film like this at home.The plot was okay, but didn't break any new super-hero ground. (Batman and Spider-Man seem to get the best scripts). Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds had good performances."
3,Decent summer flick,"This popcorn-worthy bit of fluff offers just what a summer movie should: action, effects, bad-boy attitude and quips, and chaste enough romantic interest that tween parents need not worry. In other words, all the best a summer movie should be.""Green Lantern"" also offers summer movies' biggest weaknesses: flat personalities, moral simplicity, inane dialog, and generally unrealistic interactions between characters. I mean, Sinestro with the yellow thingie in hand could have turned this into a whole different movie with a lot more to think about.Thinking wasn't in the specifications, though. I haven't read the DC comics in years, so I can't say how true it is to the series. This stays true to the spirit of comic books, though, with all the good and not-so-good that implies. There have been worse comic movies this summer, but I hope for better, too.-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters"
4,An Awesome Comic Book Film!!!,"I saw this movie in 3D and the visuals were beautiful. It had a lot of great action sequences and special effects. An Aircraft test pilot named Hal Jordan is chosen by a ring of Guardian of the Universe Abin Sur to become a new Green Lantern. With the ring, he can fly and create anything with his mind to protect people. Soon, an evil and powerful being called Parallax threatens the world, and it's up to Hal to stop it. I would definitely recommend GREEN LANTERN!!!"
4,We liked it!,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. Hadn't heard too much about it. We really liked it. Fast moving adventure. Good story. Made you feel good, with a few good laughs along the way. What more can you ask for?"
4,First Review Ever. . . Need to defend this movie!!,"Many people are bashing this movie because of the ultraviolet copy but they are just being unduly negative. The fact is the important version (the blu ray) is fine and the movie itself is pretty good (not as good as Captain America or some of the others but not bad). In addition to the blu ray you get a dvd, a code for Batman Arkham City (to play as Bat-Sinestro) and the bonus copy for your computer. Yes the ultraviolet service sucks but all it takes is filling out a quick form on flixter [...] and they will replace it with an itunes code. Also those whining about the ultraviolet don't mention that it not only comes with this film but the excellent ""Emerald Knights"" animated feature as well. As I write this I don't know if I will get the ITunes code for Emerald Knights as well but still. . . people need to get over it."
1,"Great Movie, BAD LICENSE",What kind of scam is that? Buy it to own it but the license runs out in a few months. What a bunch of scamming con artists. I cant wait to see the studios file for bankruptcy over this stuff with movies getting produced and sold directly to viewers cutting out the studios.
3,If you don't expect much...,"If you don't expect much, or if you expect it to be bad, you won't be disappointed. There were at least two parts of the story that needed to be developed more, and I think the movie would have been greatly improved. But if you want something that is entertaining and has Ryan Reynolds walking around either shirtless or in a skin tight costume, you'll be pleased."
2,Dissapointment,"I was excited to watch it but,within 10 minutes of watching it the foul language started.I'm a fan of it but,it doesn't need the language."
2,WORST movie i saw this whole summer,"I hate movies like this! they always try to make up some comedy to fit in the movie but it never flows, plus there was only like 8 minutes of ok action. When your a badass superhero you need action in the movie in which i dont see Ryan as an action actor, but the biggest thing that bothered me was that in the Justice League TV show the green lantern was black so that jst totally ruined the show for me."
1,Yet Another Example Of Comic Book Hero's Unsuccessful Translation To Film :(,"I had high hopes for this flick, but I was let down again! This movie in a word: sucks. With a little editing, it could easily be ready for broadcast on The Disney Channel in prime time! Story is weak and the extensive use of CG effects renders this ""Green Lantern"" pretty much dead on arrival. Not even hunky Ryan Reynolds can save this beast. My recommendation? Save your money and rent or buy Ryan Reynold's earlier release ""BURIED"", directed by Rodrigo Cortés. ""BURIED"" is way better than this turkey...IMHO."
1,One of the worst films of 2011,"Sure it's a pretty film. The greens are really quite stunning, but that's all I can say about this film that has any sort of positive resonance. Hal Jordan is a whiny, reluctant hero whose only real super power is the ability to annoy the viewer with his wishy-washiness. The plot is about as thin and improbable as it gets--and that's with the full understanding that I'm talking about a super hero-based universe that doesn't really exist. There are plot holes with enough gravity to create their own singularities: not even disbelief can be suspended by their power. What little action takes place is short and scattered, little islands of activity floating in a sea of dull characters, bad writing and a serious lack of contextual consistency."
1,DC blows it again,"Green Lantern is one of my all time faves, so needless to say I was a little disappointed with this abomination. There was way too much cgi and it wasn't even that great looking, plus why did the film makers think it was necessary to make Hal's uniform and mask cg too? The acting was god awful at best and the writing didn't help either. I felt bad for Ryan Reynolds, of whom I am a fan of, because he was dealt a bad hand with this one. Ryan go back to Marvel and do the Deadpool movie!Overall the movie was rushed along, too many characters not enough time or substance. Lets just say not nearly enough Sinestro. Mark Strong was the only redeeming factor of this terrible film. I don't know why DC can't make a good movie unless it's Batman or Superman. The Emerald Knight deserves way better! If you're a Green Lantern fan and haven't seen this yet, don't bother it will only enrage you."
1,One of the worst comic book-based films I've seen,"This movie is terrible. Ryan Reynolds plays a goofy Hal Jordan, nowhere near as serious as in the comic books--this was done, I suppose, to appeal to teenaged males and more especially to bring women to the theater to see the film. But it was bad. The dialogue was so bad you create a drinking game where for every clichéd piece of dialogue you have to take a shot. You'd be in your cups by the second act. The acting--not good. The special effects, for a film of this nature, looked cheap.To be honest, I hated everything about it, right down to the color green they chose. I could go on, but it's like reliving a nightmare."
1,Horrible,"Just came from seeing the Green Lantern. It was horrendous. The script was weak, the CGI was average at best, and everything seemed forced. It was hard to care about what was going on.This was on par, if not worse than Ghost Rider. I think there were only 2 scenes in which I was actually pulled in. The rest of the movie I was either trying to stay awake or thinking about dinner."
3,classic italian mayhem,"cool italian zombie film from the early 90's made in the spirit of the late 70's/early 80's gore heyday.these particular zombies are former black slaves,which is a different spin in this genre.i really liked the make up and atmosphere of their scenes.on the other hand,most of the ""acting"" is atrocious(not unique to italian horror by any means),thus the 3 star rating.if you are an established italian horror film fan,add one star and consider this for your collection."
3,YOU CAN'T KILL THE LIVING DEAD,"The movie is a great concept, but had poor execution. Three tourists are vacationing in Brazil, one of which is interested in its voodoo practices. He records a ceremony and later plays it at a cemetery at a plantation where they are subsequently stranded. The slaves who were hung by their masters come back to life and seek vengeance. The reanimated corpses are very well preserved for having been dead for so long.The acting was on par with other Italian zombie movies, which means it was bad. The vehicle had a distributor cap problem which means sometimes the vehicle worked sometimes it didn't. Normally you can fix that problem by drying out the inside of a crack cap, cleaning the contacts and gluing the cracks, otherwise you end up with a situation where the vehicle only works when the writer of the script wants it to.No f-bombs, no sex, very brief nudity (dancer)."
3,"MORE THAN OKAY , BUT NOT GOOD","The title of this movie would be considered ""politically incorrect"" today. Technonlogy has advanced so much since this movie was made. This movie is actually entertaining. It has several elements that I always like: a limited cast, a remote location, a simple plot and limited killing. I could have done without the eye gouging.It was unnecesssary. The bombing of the zombies was so fake, yet the movie never failed to keep my attention. I, being a hopeless romantic, love it when a ""Jack and Jill"" couple survive after going through ""the storm"". This is a solid 3-star movie with a good story. No one will argue that this movie desrves an Oscar for anything, but it is not a waste."
1,"One dull, low budget, worthless Zombie flick","Lenzi's only good movie is Nightmare City. Watching this giant bore makes you realize the comparitively greater talent of directors such as Fulci and Romero. A boring film: lackluster acting, plot, and zombies."
3,Pretty good,"A few discrepancies between the examples, explanations, and especially the CD, eg: where I think she changed a file or variable name in one place and forgot to change it in the other, so you spend some time trying to reconstruct what she meant to say.Otherwise well paced, good for learning."
1,Old reviews - Old code - great if you need to code for Netscape 3 or IE 4,"Note the positive reviews are for the first edition -- 2002 or 2003.Almost bought this but found it at my local library -- feel lucky about that.The examples are very out of date -- I'm guessing not updated from the first edition.Deprecated code throughout. Font tags, centered elements, elements with inline widths, bold tags, etc.Script looks old too. The overview mentions the DOM but the code examples make extensive use of document.write which is not DOM or XHTML friendly.CSS isn't introduced until near the end of the book (page 527) with a reference to ""CSS Enhanced Browsers"" (or as they are called this century -- ""Browsers"").Maybe there is some good stuff in here but the antiquated examples suggest that the practices are outdated too.I do not usually write reviews but the antiquated examples in this book compelled me to warn against it."
