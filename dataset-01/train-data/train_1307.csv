3,how about some empathy?,"I was taken aback by the judgmental tone of so many reviewers...saying things like our author is/was self-absorbed. Perhaps she is/was. But if you've ever gone through anything like divorce (regardless of the circumstances and who was to blame), it is an excruciating process during which a person can be hardly anything except self-absorbed in trying to figure out what happened and who they are after the fact. Perhaps we could demonstrate a little compassion and understand that this is a *memoir* and a documentation of this woman's personal journey. Further, who she is in this book is not necessarily who she will end up being. Life is a journey. Let's show some grace to people. God knows we *all* need it in some way or another."
3,sad rumblings of a woman whose life is crumbling,"Few of us can do what this author did. Take a whole year off traveling and living off of supposed money that a book was suppose to generate. She divorces her husband on unknown grounds of supposedly being 'bored' and goes into another affair with another guy without thought and now is depressed because it too doesn't work out. She is working on her spirtuality which helps because honestly there is fundamentally something amiss in her soul and spirit for her to do these destructive things to herself.The author's voice in this story is very down to earth and easy to relate to. It's just a bitty depressing even though this author seems to be living the 'high life' of traveling as she pleases and enjoying her 'time off' for a year. All in all, a good read but somewhat painful and long in some areas. I had difficulties with the 2nd chapter and it's taking me a long time to get through chapter 3 because at this time it's not that interesting to me now."
1,BORING,What else can I say? One of the most boring books I have ever read. Very hard to read through to the end.
1,"Elizabeth, next time, stay home","The real subtitle should be:One woman is paid extraordinary advance for extraordinary travel drivel!She ate too much, loved herself more than was warranted, and I pray her sister never speaks to her again."
1,Waste of Time,"This is one of the few books I could not finish. It bored me to tears. I found the author very self-absorb, and irratating. She acts like she is the only person in the world who has every been depressed and experienced heartache. Save your money and time. Read a different book."
2,Sorry I wasted my time on this one,"This book reminded me of what Morley Safer(?) once said to Martha Stewart: I can see why your husband divorced you.Gilbert's not a bad writer, which kept me plugging along, hoping for more. I kept waiting for this whiny, self-absorbed woman to grow from her worldly experiences, but, alas, she never did. In the end, I'm sorry I bothered to finish the book."
1,Decided not to read.....,"Had thought I would like to read this book, but once I read the premise reconsidered. Realized she wanted neither a child nor her husband...divorced and transformed into a hedonist. GROTESQUE! Spiritual? Baloney. Serve in a soup kitchen. Life isn't all about self. A little less navel gazing, PLEASE!"
2,"Three words... Stink, Stank, STUNK!!!","I managed to work my way all the way through this drivel. As others have mentioned, the author is self-absorbed, narcissistic, and has an overactive ego. Why in the world would anyone care about this ""story""? Of what relevance is it to any of us? None of the divorced people I know were able to gallavant around the world feeling sorry for themselves -- they were too busy busting their rear-ends trying to pay their lawyers, pay their bills and make sure their children were surviving the painful ordeal. One thought to Elizabeth Gilbert.... get a REAL life!!I gave it two stars (rather than one) because it IS well-written. Ms. Gilbert clearly knows how to write and the book reads easily. It's just the subject matter that drags down the rating..."
2,Entertaining but not sustaining...,"It was a perfect commute read. Went down easy but didn't sustain. Once I closed the cover, poof, it vanished, the literary equivalent of junk food. I was also perplexed that the author determined in Italy her only (apparently) source of pleasure would be food and that she did not take advantage of all the art, history, culture, architecture and music that are also there to be enjoyed. Often, I found her descriptions of eating and food kind of gluttonous. As a practitioner of yoga myself, I was surprised that she seemed to lean so heavily on her guru for insight and guidance. She mentioned nothing of learning to follow the ""inner teacher"" which is what yoga is supposed to help you do. If you come to the book with low or no expectations, you'll probably like it. If you come thinking you (or she) are going to have some earthshaking epiphanies, you'll be disappointed."
3,"Good, but not great.","I enjoyed reading this novel and ironically began reading it on a flight to Italy. The book dragged a bit in the middle section for me and I felt that at times the author could be a bit self centered. However, I think the purpose of the novel was to tell the story of the author finding herself and naturally parts of the novel are bound to be self centered as the book is focusing on herself! This was just one woman's exceptional self discovery that she decided to put down in print and I believe that many people go on journeys of self exploration. People discover themselves in different manners and I do not feel that its fair to judge the author based on the manner in which she discovered herself. I think readers need to keep in mind that this is one story told by the author about the author. The book is decently entertaining and I particularly liked the section about Italy. I recommend this as a summer reading book but I wouldn't describe this novel as life changing."
3,Really didn't capture my attention,"Overall, this book is just a little better than average. It didn't really capture my attention the way I'd hoped."
2,1/3 Good,"I know this story is about a woman searching for, well, the meaning of life or really the meaning of her life as she enters a sort of midlife crisis. I really enjoyed the first journey which was through Italy. That part was great and I really wanted to like the rest, however I just never made it that far in enjoyment. I finished the book but I'm just not a fan of this one.Gilbert is a talented writer and this book is written well but just not terribly interesting to read about a person who just eats and travels, has sex and then moves about leaving all responsibilities behind. I wanted something a little deeper. It would have been great if the culture of each location was expanded upon. I'm also not sure why the author felt the need to include her own political opinions in this book. Didn't seem necessary to the story. Silly really."
2,eat pray live in fantasy land,"Really can anyone just move around on a whim like this broad? And whose paying for it? I was disappointed in the ""flow"" of this book and also how unlike my life it was. I was I guess hoping to be inspired. Instead I'll hope the movie is better,.. but I doubt it."
2,Not so great,"I was excited to read this book. I loved the movie & thought the book must be twice as good. I found it a little boring. I even tried to listen on cd, as I do with many books, but Liz's voice is too soothing. If I sat down to listen I would fall asleep. I don't think the book is awful, just not for me."
2,"Mildly entertaining, but WAY overrated","Pros: At times Gilbert writes in an interesting and funny way making SMALL PARTS of this book entertaining to read.Cons: The rest of the book (a majority of it) is painful to read. The book is more of a pity party for Gilbert's failed marriage than it is a deep look into these amazing cultures.It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but I would recommend spending your money on something else."
1,"Eat, pray, love. Get real....","The author knew how to eat. Well, she had been paid for it in advance. She prayed. But she couldn't define to whom. And she got paid for it in advance. She loved? Well she certainly loved herself. And she got paid for it in advance. How about a donation from Ms. Gilbert to the humanities to study how a book of such caliber could reach the audience that it has."
1,Cry Scream Swear!!!,That is exactly what this book made me want to do!! HORRIBLE from the start. I am an avid reader and this is the first time in my life that I could not finish a book that I started. I've read travel guides that were more interesting!
1,Don't bother,I just tried to finish this book and absolutely could not. The first 10 pages are the best. Do not buy this book or even bother to check it out at the library.
1,YUCK,"This is the first and last book that Oprah raves about that I'll ever read. YUCK what a bore. Gave up on it half way through, then gave it to good will."
2,Disappointing book by self-absorbed although talented author,"I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library. I decided to give it a try because I'd heard so many good reviews, because I'm an avid reader and I love to travel, too. I only made it through the first several chapters of the book before I had to return it to the library for another patron, and I won't bother requesting it again. It's not worth the wait.The author's writing style, I will admit, is engaging. However, her whiny tone, self-absorbed outlook on life and overall interpretation of her experiences is vain and unbecoming. I read her words and think, ""If I met her in person, she'd probably be someone I'd try to stay away from!"" She seems to have a ""poor me"" attitude that, although it likely improves over the course of the book, was far too heavy at the beginning for me to consider pursuing the end."
4,Helped me find my path,I enjoyed this book and the authors description of her travels. It gave me pause to reflect on my own path in life. An enjoyable book that I've passed on to friends and family members (who've also all enjoyed it).
2,pretty annoying but slightly informative,"I really expected to like this book based upon all of the stellar reviews it got. May be it is my personality not matching up with hers, but I found myself incessantly irritated by the author's narcissism and sappiness. I am all for introspection and self-exploration. I have once or twice or, okay, a gazillion times, fallen prey to the itchy feet syndrome when confronted with a life crisis. I keep wondering why so many people liked this book, and it kind of reminds me of a Fried Green Tomatoes kind of thing, or maybe a Thelma and Louise thing... kind of a ""you go girl"" mentality. I found a lot of the information very interesting, especially regarding yoga and meditation, and it did make me think about my own spiritual life, but I couldn't help but think that maybe she was writing this book with her ex-husband and ex-lover David as an audience."
1,Finally! Hope for the upper-middle class!,"At long last someone has written a book to help other miserable, upper-middle class white people transcend their sad, sad, lives! Gah. I can recall a far better book. It's called ""Siddartha."""
2,Cartwheels for the self-indulgent.,"When a little girl learns to do cartwheels, she tells and shows anyone and everyone, all the time saying, ""Look at me! Look at me!"" My current perspective of the author in this book is an adult showing off her cartwheels all the while saying, ""Look at me! Look at me!"" She tells everyone (in great detail) the who what when where & why of her cartwheels, including each time she tried and failed. Perhaps her voyage of indulging every whim will help others, but I don't think reading is how most learn to do cartwheels."
1,Another Liberal Bush Basher,"When I opened this book, I identified immediately and felt comforted. Then she got into the Bush bashing and it ruined the whole thing for me. I didn't finish the book and I felt really bad about it. I can only say -""shut up and write."" I'm not interested in your political opinions."
2,Don't Recommend It,"I read the first ""section"" of the book and it was just okay. Maybe because I've been to Italy and knew the places she spoke of, etc. The second section bored me and I didn't even bother to finish the book. It constantly felt like Gilbert was bragging, blah blah blah I left my husband but it's okay b/c I have wealthy publishers to finance a trip around the world for me, and so on. I can't connect with that. Don't waste your time or money."
2,A narcist's rant,"I read this book for the sole reason that it had been on the best seller list for a long time.The good thing about this book is that it shows how the author saw herself through the bad times and was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to it and learn something from it.However, it was unbearable to see everything in the book being about herself and nothing else. Her every interaction with people has a sole purpose. Herself.She talked about a girl she befriended in the ashram in India. She says that the girl wore spectacles that had broken lens but that didnt keep her from wearing it.. For some reason I got stuck on that line.Even when she supposedly falls in love, it is all about how he treats her/compliments her and such.Also, It wasn't very convincing to see someone change from one mode to another seamlessly (Eat pray love) and become oblivious of the previous mode."
1,dreadful,"I am so happy to see that other people had the same reaction to this book that I had. I, too, had to quit before getting too far and I NEVER do that! But the author is unbearably self-absorbed. Thanks to other reviewers for their honesty."
5,Naval gazinf but surprisingly excellent,"This was chosen for our book club and I was reticent as I do not enjoy books on religion and I was worried that she'd be very preachy, thankfully, she's not. Yes, she does an astounding amount of naval gazing but she is self-depracating and quite humorous. I loved, loved, loved the first section in Italy and so agreed with many of her observations, Pray was hard since she's just so determined to put herself through some tremendous mind hurtles to get to a state of enlightnement, then Love, is a beautiful ending to the book. Is she annoying? At times, sure but she lays herself bare and it's an interesting journey with a triumphant ending."
3,Interesting...,"I know some people are rabid in their love for this memoir. I did enjoy this book, but I wouldn't say I was over the moon with it. Gilbert's voice was very genuine and I always love that about a memoir. If a memoir doesn't feel like the person is truly being themselves, then it loses something for me.I do admire Gilbert's moxie, though. It takes a tremendous amount of courage to do what she did.I enjoyed the first third and last third more than the middle portion. Gilbert's time in India moved very slowly and I didn't enjoy it as much as I did her retelling of her time spent in Italy and Bali.I would definitely recommend this memoir, but perhaps with less zeal than other readers."
3,I can relate to this journey,"We all go on a journey in life, and Gilbert's journey reminded me of my own. I really enjoyed the humor and the writing style (except for moments when I felt like I was reading Cosmo); and I think her premise is clever. Hedonism versus Spiritualism and then bringing all back to living in day-to-day life. However, what I didn't enjoy was the sudden turnabout and epiphany at the end. It seemed contrived and I felt as if I were being deceived just so she could end on a high note. And having traveled a lot myself, I know that the real journey begins when you return home. I would recommend this book to women that are reevaluating their lives, but I would recommend it more for the inspirational journey than the writing quality."
5,Eat Pray Love It!,i loved reading this book. it was surprising that i did so much after reading some negative reviews about it. i found her to be comical at times but in a good way. when i was reading this book i was in the pray/love section of the book when my grandfather passed away. i found that her talking about finding religion and love helped me thru that period. but all in all it was a good book.
3,"Well written, works as a book","This was one of my first Kindle downloads, so I got through it without the benefit of paper and ink. The author writes well, and she makes the book tie together effectively. She didn't make me like her--there is a certain superficial, flippant gloss to all she says--but the book was a pleasant read on a tropical balcony. Most people her age cannot write, and she can."
3,enjoying other countries and peopleElizabeth,Elizabeth has a very specific taste in the three countries. You learn about things that are normally not covered in travellogues. She has some very perceptive comments about Italian culture (Italian men do not make all the comments about women and are not on the make through words) apparently that has changed because of women's offense to their leering. I have not read the whole book but it is not boring and ove along with the greatest of ease.
4,Great book!,I would recommend this book to anyone who is 'searching' for answers in their life in all areas. She does a great job at using her story to impact the reader.
4,an interesting read,"I was given this book by a friend, and enjoyed it. It's the whole ""I got depressed, life wasn't working out, I ran away from my troubles and learned something about life"" type of story. A feel gooder if you're in that type of situation."
3,"Eat, Pray and Love","I enjoyed this book. Gave some interesting information about the countries visited,including the people, food and cultures. It's easy to identify with her pursuit of spirituality and love. She has a great writing style that's easy to read and which keeps one's interest. I would recommend this book to any woman."
3,It ended up being good,"The best part of this book was the humor. Liz is able to capture the voice of my girlfriends and I (Hello-she quoted R.E.M!). There was, however, a whiff of conceit at times that was hard to stomach. As I got further into the story, it became more captivating. Ultimately, she did win me over and her story and the message was inspiring."
3,Overrated but a breezy read.,"If you like silly, neurotic stories-then this one is for you. Its an easy read and the author is reflective, but I didn't come away with the feeling that I had been on a spiritual journey. First of all, I didn't understand where she was coming from-all divorces are painful but not everyone decides to take off across the world and since she was financially successful, (she even had to give her husband money), I couldn't feel sorry for her or understand her identity crisis. I liked her travels in Bali the best-by then she was overcoming some of her insecurities, but it would have been more interesting to read about the medicine man and the woman she helped save her business, then the love affair that ended like a happy ending. This is a good summer novel to read on the beach."
5,Favorite of the year,"This is my favorite book of the year. Following Gilbert's journey as she searches for herself, you'll be reading with one hand, and packing a suitcase with the other. Loved it !!!Helen Gallagher, authorComputer Ease"
1,An awful book,I thought this book would be good because it was made into a movie. That is not the case. I could not even finish this book it was so bad. I usually can read any type of books. I even gave it to a friend to read and she could not get through it either. I didn't even bother with the sequel to it. Not worth the money.
1,Very Disappointing!,"With so much fanfare surrounding this book and as someone who has traveled (as a woman solo) to Australia, Bali, Thailand, Japan etc. it was so lacking to the point of nausea. And, to add insult to literary injury, the writing style was so elementary that it actually detracted from the already mediocre storyline. Maybe a better writer could have done the story more justice??? Maybe!?!?"
5,eat pray love book review,"I received the ""eat pray love"" used paperback book in great shape, and within 6 days.The book itself was very readable and enjoyable!! This story is autobiographical and covers mainly 12 months in the author's life as she travels to 3 specific countries (Italy, India, and Indonesia), and searches for some understanding and balance in her life following a very rocky divorce and some bad decisions, etc.The author is very self-centered initially, but she slowly becomes less so as the book marches on. While she never looses that characteristic completely, she does progress and improve in her tolerance for seeing and meeting others needs besides her own. The book is loaded with cleverness, pathos, humor, some sadness, heart-jerking love stories, and many, many quotable lines.I read it for a Literati Book Club that I recently joined.Plat"
1,Penguin is the worst publisher around,The Kindle book costs $13 and the paperback costs $8.25. I wonder how long it will take the morons at Penguin to realize that it doesn't matter if there is a movie coming out about the book and the hype is defeaning - I'm not stupid and will not pay almost $5 more to save them money.
2,disappointing,"This started out so promising, then became weighed down with self absorbing drivel. I struggled to finish, hoping it would turn back around, but it never did."
1,I can't even finish this book!!,I can't stand this woman because she is so self-absorbed!! I can't even get through it!
5,:) Beautiful journey to Italy India Bali,"I truly loved the people she met in Italy, India and Indonesia. I think male or female should read this.. I am pretty anxious for the movie that Julia Roberts portrays Jen Gilbert. Her story and I have a similar story after a friend's death in 2007 of course I was in mourning but I also decided to learn to love God and myself even more. I totally forgot it has taken me 3 years that I am still single but I am just enjoying the little things....Richard from Texas always spoke in bumper sticker but, always gave her good talks which Jen Gilbert winds up marrying in the next book she wrote.Writing reviews are always hard because, you don't want to leave out anything but write the favorites.When she arrived in Bali, it felt like an dream the way Jen described it ."
1,"Snore, Snore, Snore","I cannot understand why people like this boooooooring book. I painfully made it through Italy and started India...that's when I couldn't take it anymore and felt that stapling my hand to the wall would be far more interesting than continuing with this woman who never stops talking about the damn bathroom floor...save yourself and save your money! I hope I can get a few bucks for it at the used bookstore especially since I only read a portion. Seriously this woman quit her marriage for some reason that she won't share....umm ok isn't that part of what sent her out on this journey that resulted in an overly hyped up, waste of paper, diary of a cry baby? She roamed around Italy eating and talking a bunch of nonsense meanwhile not having to worry about money thanks to her book advance. What idiot publisher did that! I agree with many of the other reviews.....she is a spoiled lame. I will not even bother seeing the movie ugg!"
1,Skip it.,"Catchy title, but what a crapfest...err...huge disappointment. The author is selfish and shallow. Did I mention shallow? This woman feels sorry for herself. Her solution is to take trips around the world and meet with spiritual gurus? Gaaack! I read that she got an advance on the book prior to all the trips. I do not know if that is true. But I tend to believe it.There is nothing Christian about this book. I usually pass my books on to other people. Not this one. It's going in the trash. If you absolutley must read it, check it out from the library."
2,"What is ""spiritual"" about this book?","I agree with the reviewers who said that Gilbert's writing is ""dishonest"" - it's as if she deliberately dumbed down her experiences in order to make Oprah's book list and to sell a lot of copies of this marginally written shallow book.Even her experience in Italy is sort of depressing. THAT is hedonistic pleasure and re-awakening? Her life before her journey appears to be identical to her life during the jouurney- being paid to travel and write about it in a way that appeals to the masses - essentially saying nothing at all. And how are any of her actions or beliefs spiritual? She is more self-obsessed than a teenager and I was sad and embarrased for her.I should have been scared off when I saw it was a best-seller. It's not entirely awful because it's amusing in places but ultimately not worth it."
2,Getting in Touch,"I picked up Eat, Pray and Love several times in the bookshops since it was published in 2006. I put it down. Several friends asked me: have you read the book? I hadn't. Finally, at the bookshop a few weeks ago a friend asked, you haven't read it? Let me get it for you. OK, I said. I finished reading it a few days ago. It reminded me Sarah McDonald's Holy Cow. Written in a breezy style, I felt it lacked depth. However, I was empathetic with the Gilbert's need to do what she as doing and needed to heal. The strengh of the book is that Gilbert does carry out her dreams and helps herself. Many women I know have this need, but not the courage to cary it out. For those I think the books is inspirational. It talks of following your heart and geting in touch wiht your heart."
2,It is not what i have expected!,"I thought this book would be very good (according to the reviews on Amazon) but the author is very selfish and to hear about her ""painful"" divorce gets annoying after a while. Its a book that you will forget quick because it has no meaning whatsoever. I dont understand how this book got all theese ratings but I say, its not wroth reading."
4,Keep An Open Mind,"I know there are a lot of people who don't have anything nice to say about the author or this book, but I am not one of them. I found this book poignant and inspiring. It is the story of one woman; a woman who was lost and found a way to rediscover herself and take control of her life. I didn't find it to be self-absorbed or preaching in any way. The book is a journey, which happens to be spiritual. I believe anyone who has experienced great loss or grief can relate in some way."
1,"Disappointment, Disappointment, Disappointment","From the very first page of her book, I felt cheated....She was soul cleansing? I don`t think so. For such and educated, and talented person, and she tells us that so many times in the book, I found the book depressing. One hundred and forty someting times she is crying on the bathroom floor........Her flight to Italy left something wanting. If she is eating well, share the delights of the food. Take a tip from Frances Mayes. Let us relish the experience with her......India and praying.....She really didn`t find or reach her spritual growth, and quite frankly, I could care less how many times she had to scrub the floor......Now, love,.....She has found the person to worship her in Bali.....I feel she is just a very needy person and even though we are led to believe she is an independent woman, her goal is simply a man....I was never so relived to finish the book."
2,a disappointment,i found this book to be way overrated and the author egotistical. would've been nice to read more about the cultures she encountered and less about her. about half way through the book i wanted to tell her to get over herself already.
4,"nicely written, fun read",I really enjoyed this book. The author has a nice way /writing style and the book was very enjoyable.
4,IT IS LIKE TRAVELING WITHOUT TAKING A PLANE,"THIS WAS AN EXPERIENCE OF TRAVELING WITHOUT TAKING A PLANE, MEDITATING AND EATING GOOD...WITHOUT LEAVING HOME...DREAMING YOU COULD DO LIKE HER..."
1,Cheap Sympathy,"The author got bored to hell about life suddenly in the 30's even after having a good income, education , excellent country, friends, husband etc. And she starts enjoying the world with our money (Publisher's money doesn't fall from sky), learns new language, gets fresh friendship and sex with a man in 50's(who knows how many women he's cheated in life), all under the banner called LOVE. Women, in general, if they follow the author, are surely bound for a failure in life."
1,Is This What Passes for Spirituality?,"Just because someone practices gluttony for a year, chants in a ashram and screws around in Bali doesn't mean they had a spiritual experience. This is pathetic and one of the most self-absorbed ramblings in recorded history. Does the world really need a field guide for selfishness? Can't they just watch a few minutes of Joel Osteen?"
1,Morally embarrasing,"A spiritual journey paid for by a publisher? Need I say more? If anyone is inspired to make a spiritual journal as a result of reading this book, I recommend that they send the bill to Ms. Gilbert."
3,"Good read, but not a page turner.","There are moments when I really liked this book and moments when I thought it was so boring that I would have put it down if I wasn't leading a book club discussion on it's contents.Eat, Pray, Love is split into three obvious sections- the author eats in Italy, prays in India and (you guessed it) loves in Indonesia.Italy and Indonesia are the sections I consider worth reading. India was boring! I found the author to be witty and egocentric. The novel focuses almost entirely on her self degrading thoughts, which in the section title Pray in India, become overwhelming and boring! In the other two sections however the author is able to balance wit and plot with her egocentricity.I wouldn't read this book again. I would reccomend this book to a friend who might be in the midst of some depressing moment in life, such as a divorce, like the author."
4,"Eat, Pray, and Love this book!","Although at times a little ""woohoo"", this author lays it all on the line to find life's perfect balance. Too bad most of us don't have a bottomless checkbook where we can also go ""find ourselves"" in India, Italy, etc. Where's my passport??????"
5,Very Good,The book was in brand new condition and came sooner than planned (although since I'm in australia it still took forever). Very happy!
1,Dumbest Book I've Ever Read!,"Here we go again - another dumb twit using adultery to go 'find herself'. She cheats on her husband then whines about how she is getting a raw deal in the divorce. I find it hard to believe that any publisher with a lick of sense would pre-pay someone to write this pathetic dribble. My cat could do a better job with a story. What is really sad is that this garbage has such a big appeal to the stupid, needy white women that watch Oprah."
1,Wasted reading,It was the worst book that I read in 2007. I am very happy that I borrowed it from the public library. Ms. Gilbert came across as an immature woman who could never fully comprehend the overall ramifications of her personal actions. I quit reading this book after page 50.
1,Who is she trying to fool?,"I recognized the ashram very quickly. Who does the author think she is fooling? Here are the clues: the ashram in the U.S. is in the Catskill Mountains. The founder dies in 1982. His successor is an attractive female. The ashram in India is near Mumbai. Before you can attend that ashram, you have to study for two years and apply. So you want to know my ""guess""? The founder is Muktananda. The female guru is Gurumayi. I suggest you google their names and Siddha Yoga. Be sure and read the article from The New Yorker by Lis Harris dated November 14, 1994, ""O Guru, Guru, Guru"". Also, read Daniel Shaw's article ""Traumatic Abuse in Cults: A Psychoanalytic Perspective"". Notice that the reviews with a one star of Eat, Pray, Love and Daniel Shaw's article refer to ""narcissism"". Elizabeth, you did quite a bit of homework for your chapters; maybe not enough....."
2,Great anticipation- BUT self-absorbed all about me book,"I eagerly anticipated reading this book since I am devoted to yoga and would love to visit India one day. Unfortunately this book is a story of a woman and it's all about me, me and more me! I suppose my purchase was based on what I had hoped the book was about -the joys of travel and new experiences, not a self-absorbed rendition constantly forcing the reader to hear more about her divorce. Give me more India and travel extravaganzas and less personal woes and me me me!!!"
1,"A torrid love affair between a man, a woman and giant bowl of poo","Having never seen this book in person (only read it on kindle)I can not actually verify if it does exist in real life or if this book was created by two transients who happened to saunter into a public library and proceeded to make love atop a keyboard. I was disgusted by the entire theme of this novel. 873 pages of people complaining that they cant get out from under an invisible dome, and then in the end it turns out to be a group of alien kids. Sure, the part where the cops son stashes the bodies in the pantry and visits them at night over and over again was hilarious and probably the most realistic comparison to my own life that I have been able to find in any romantic comedy, but all and all I don't approve. I don't know why I trusted this Stephanie King person again after the trouble I got in reading her collection of children's short stories ""IT"" to my little boy before bed."
5,Book,"This was an amazing read for me...I cried, laughed, and sat in introspection. While I know it was Aristotle philosophy it was a great book to read for a time in my life that I needed validation for my feelings of uninteresting in a shallow life. Hope you enjoy :)"
1,Just canning it so Amazon will stop recommending this to me,I've read a few reviews and thus I have no interest in reading the book or watching the movie. This is divorce porn that panders to women thinking they are going to do better by deserting their family and shirking their responsibilities.
5,Honestly written,"She honestly shares her deep emotional states with the reader, raising my great sympathy and empathy. I've learned a lot from the detailed descriptions she made during her one-year trip."
5,A spiritual awakening,"This book seemed to start slow but evolved quickly. It follows one young ladie's travels across Italy, India,and Indonesia in an effort to find herself. Through her adventures one can personally see how a spiritual awakening changes her life. I would highly recommend this book for those of you searching for a soemthing more out of life. She provides a positive exapmle of the power we each have to create positive change in our own lives. Both fun and moving!"
3,If only we all had this opportunity in our lives.....,"Boy, if only we all had an opportunity like this in our lives to take a year off of work and travel the world! Ok, jealousy aside...Eat, Pray, Love was an interesting book, pretty well-written, but it didn't live up to my expectations.I guess I just found this book dragging at times, well, quite often. I didn't feel the emotions well enough from the author, I didn't ""get"" her. So, this is probably why this was only an OK read for me. I just couldn't relate or find inspiration in what I was reading.I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend. Again, it wasn't horrible, it just didn't hold my interest and it certainly didn't meet my expectations with seeing it on all the hot-sellers lists in the last year. Oh well."
4,"eat, pray, love: one woman's amazing journey to finding herself!",Liz Gilbert opens up her mind & her soul to share with readers her personal journey almost as a rebirth! You'll cry and laugh and absolutely LOVE this book!
3,Interesting,This book was a little different than I expected. Some parts are rather explicit in the authors thinking. Some parts dragged a bit.I thought it interesting the extent the author went through for her recovery which most of us cannot afford or have access to. I did enjoy it for the most part and would recommend it for something different.
4,Loved two-thirds of it!,"I absolutely loved the first section of the book (re: failed relationships and then Italy); was bored to tears in the middle India/Ashram/Guru section, and therefore skimmed it quickly; and then enjoyed the Bali/Felipe section very much. I would have voted 5 stars had the middle section not been such a drag. Ms. Gilbert comes across as a bit self-absorbed, yes, but she also knows how to laugh at herself. I thought she came across as very funny, kind and smart, and I definitely plan to read her other books."
2,The Grass Is Always Greener Somewhere Else,"I don't understand this lady. Why did it take her so long to discover the fact she didn't want to have a child or to be married? And why did she stay in New York three more years before deciding to travel to Italy, India, and Indonesia? Why not Paraguay, Siberia, or Lithuania? Personally, I would have stayed in New York. This has to be one of the dumbest books I have ever read."
1,I just wanted to tell her to grow up,"I read this book because my wife wanted me to. I hated it. There was plenty of good writing, but every time Ms. Gilbert fell into a weepy pile of self-pity on the floor I wanted to scream. Everybody has problems. A friend of my daughter's was diagnosed with brain cancer two years after finishing college. Now there's somebody with a serious problem, but she hasn't let it stop her from getting married and going on with her life. I can't even begin to understand the appeal of this book."
1,Utter stupidity,"I thoroughly agree with C. Quinn's review. The author is insipid and her observations trite. Also, I found it totally boring, so much so that I could not even finish it."
1,Agreed,"Agreed, difficult to finish, selfish, self-absorbed, the all American me me me syndrome in full swing here. Author really missed the boat on this one."
1,save your money,"A few laughs. A few good quotes. Good writing - but I thought some parts were offensive. A change your life book? No way.This is a book about one woman's honest search for something meaningful, peaceful, and spiritual in her life. A great journey for her....but not earth shattering for me."
1,Truly Awful!!,"Possibly the WORST book I have EVER read... Totally self absorbed, narcissistic, a total joke. Sadly, I thought the beginning and Italy were great, but then it was so, me, me, me..... blah, blah, blah. Actually, I have never felt compelled to write a review, but if I can save someone the PAIN of reading this piece of JUNK, I hope this helps. This reminds me of all the women who are always looking for something more, never appreciating what is right in front of them. I am sure this Author (if you can actually call her that), will go on to have a very rich (in Money) life, but very poor life, in everything else that matters.The best thing i can say about this book is, I can ask people if they like it and then take them off my sharing a book list, and write them down as Vapid, self absorbed people, who can't wait to leave their families, etc....Don't bother..."
3,overall a pretty good book but ...,"i liked the book but what pissed me off is that she never mentioned with sympathy in what bad conditions people live in India and Indonesia, especially women, though she represented herself as a such kind, loving and generous person. she praised herself throughout the whole book."
2,"I don't want to strangle the author, but the book was disappointing","I wish I could have traveled the world for an entire year and pigged out on pasta to get over my divorce. Instead, I was forced to drink too much and eat a lot of chocolate and tell anyone who would listen what an a-hole my ex was.I enjoyed reading about the food in Italy, but that was about it. I was kind of disappointed, after all the good hype about the book."
4,Good read.,A book about a woman's quest for self-discovery in a modern society. In it there is something with which each woman can identify... if she is truthful.
3,three different authors?,This book started off great! I was laughing out loud and reading passages to my husband. Then it seemed like the author realized she was having too much fun and sprialed down hill from there. The middle of the book was just a bit too deep after coming from the laughs we had just had. The end of the book lightened up in mood but was somehow just plain bland.It is almost like 3 different women wrote this book without even the decency of getting together on it to get the styles straight.
4,Recommened Book To Read,This was a great book. It allowed me to think about my life a lot. I would recommend it to all women.
1,disappointing and shallow,"I agreed with all the negative reviews. It was self fulfilled prophecy when the author found herself on this trip to 'find herself' as she got a book advance - not divine intervention.She spends the book hemming and hawing about her breakups, and ends her year of self reflection and correction by attaching herself to another man.The writing was quirky and amusing - but its unfortunate and aggravating to learn this much about her shallowness and insecurities."
1,Pathetic,"This book was written by an unhappy narcissistic woman who is an utter bore. Another classic example of many of the women I encounter daily. We are living in a society where being totally self-absorbed has become the norm, it is so sad we have come to this. After mentioning she was not going to talk about her acrimonious divorce, she continually brings it up time after time. How pathetic that this book has good reviews when it is clearly a tale of self-indulgent whining and moaning about her lot in life. It is disheartening that this book has achieved good reviews when it is clearly a prime example of our generation of women in our society who could make a difference, but prefer to be extremely self-absorbed and focused on material goods, prestige and the ""me-me-me"" syndrome. This book is not worth the money and is boringly pathetic."
5,Dive In,"This book will take you to far away lands without the need for a plane ticket. The detail and writing is beautiful and creates the image of fine are in the mind. Informative, powerful, fun, compelling. A MUST READ."
2,Would not pass on to a friend,"I enjoyed parts of this book but not the book as a whole. I did not have a problem with finding her self centered or self indulgent, as many other reviewers here did. I admired the bravery of the writer and thought her adventure was great, It's just that many parts of this book were sooooo slow, I did not expect the book to be largely focused on her religious beliefs. I would not pass this book on to a friend, not memorable for me ..."
1,"Read, Gag, Puke!","At only page 87 I'm trying to force myself to finish but I'm so tired of all the whining from a self absorbed, over-privileged, neurotic Type A that she's stressing me out! I can't tolerate these types in real life so I'm left asking myself if I want to invest the time to read a book about one. ""Oh, I'm SOOO miserable! Boo-hoo! I have everything I've ever wanted and I'm sobbing in a fetal position on the bathroom floor every night with a knife to my arm.""I certainly think the depression diagnosis was incomplete and would also add borderline personality disorder. Self absorbed cry-baby isn't a real diagnosis but it should be.I certainly hope Gilbert is over herself already and I am SOO disappointed a movie was made from this book. I've read a billion other books more movie worthy than this giant snot-rag."
2,Navel gazing,"Tedious, banal, self-absorbed, neurotic... Her story embodies the decline of American grit. That this book should be a bestseller is a sad commentary on the vapidness of our society."
1,"Eat, Pray,Love","My book had 30 pages missing!!!!Also towards the back of the book, approx. 20 pages were duplicated. And those were not the missing pages.Very discouraging."
5,Great writing!,"All the time I was reading this book, I admit I was terribly envious of Elizabeth Gilbert -- not just because she'd performed this wonderful ""making lemonade from life's lemons"" act, transforming herself from a depressed and lonely divorced New Yorker into a world traveler who relishes nearly every moment of her year in Italy, India, and Indonesia -but also because her writing is so wonderful, and so seeminly effortless. She finds the most amazing descriptions and comparisons and metaphors to describe cities, people, situations, and (oh gosh, especially!) food. For that reason alone -- the wonderful writing -- this book is worth reading (although, like I said, it did make me envious of her).If you are looking for something like ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" or ""The Swimming Pool"" this isn't it. But if you love good writing, read this book."
4,great book,this book was a gift i wasnt sure i was going to like but once i syarted reading it i was hooked
5,"Eat, Pray Love","This is a wonderful book for anyone on a peresonal journey into themselves. It begins with the seeming mundane and progresses into very important lessons that we all can learn. Very worthwhile read to deepen personal awareness and relationship with self, thus improving relationship with others.Very simply written with a deal of humour which is very importantwith such a ""meaty"" subject"
2,Disappointed,"If you want to follow the travels of an incredibly narcisstic individual then this book is for you. If not, then I suggest passing it up. The author comes across as shallow and self-serving, especially in the divorce of her husband. I would love to travel to Italy, India and Bali. However, I wouldn't divorce my husband and abandon my family to do it. Finding God and understanding yourself comes from true soul searching, sacrifice, and commitment. This is a typical example of a person who expresses the motto ""It's all about me!"""
3,Until the moment....,"I was rather enjoying this book, self-indulgent or not, until the moment the author made disparaging remarks about George W. Bush. Then, for me, she became no more than one of the hordes of KoolAid drinkers. Why a woman on a journey of self-disclosure and ""wisdom"" succumbs to the pop culture compulsion to blame George Bush for everything from the disappearance of the DoDo Bird, through the VietNam Conflict all the way to Obama's current mess is a mystery. Further, such stupid, ill-considered declarations reduce anyone, in my estimation, to the likes of Natalie Mains. I put the book in my Goodwill bag. I am just glad that I was given the book and didn't waste my own hard-earned, taxed-to-death-for-the-benefit-of-those-who-depend-on-Big-Government money on it."
1,if you like self absorbed novels here you go,"Basically this book is a self induced food eating coma that the writer cannot get out of. Yes these are the three things that one must do in live to get by, but um, she comes off as a selfish brat that has to run away from her life, which by the way this book was funded by the pre contract money to write this book. It is so self asborbed and very annoying, it did not change my life only by the fact that i wish i did not spend money on it, ugh, it left a horrbile taste in my mouth also. Dont read this book."
5,Eat Pray Love a Life Journey,"Eat Pray Love draws you in like a magnet to a refrigerator door, holding you securely like a grade A report card. Each step of Elizabeth's journey of discovery and adventure is like our own fantasy brought to life. Her fabulous descriptive way of sharing love lost and love found will make you smile, weep, and rejoice. With every delicious morsel she consumes throughout her journey you will find yourself hungering for more.Every prayer uttered will be shared by you. Each page in this book seems to turn itself as you go along for the ride of her life. All I can say to every woman over the age of 35 who hasn't already read this book is; ""read this book you'll be glad that you did!"" Copyright KatherinesCorner.com-for Amazon.com"
3,SO SO AT BEST,"Being a commercial writer myself, books like this make me wonder if I'm missing something because this book is really not very interesting. It left me feeling that most readers who enjoy such a story must be living a very superficial existence because this is exactly what this story describes, even taking into consideration its lightweight overtures to some vague kind of spiritual dimension working behind the mundane goings on of everyday life. If you're looking to hear about something new and inspirational and exciting I would not recommend that you read eat, pray and love."
2,Good idea gone astray!,"I made it through to the end unlike some other reviewers. I found the book to be well written and the narrative voice held my interest in a rubber-necker sort of way. I kept wondering what absurdity might appear on the next page. The story is more about the vacuous boredom some people experience when ""success"" means they don't really need anybody or anything. Gilbert lamented her own emotional woes without acknowledging the trail of destruction she left in her wake."
2,Can't get into this book.,"I purchased the audio version and really wanted to like it with all the hoopla...I can't waste my time any more trying to get into this book. I tried, just not interested. I found my mind wandering and just wasn't keeping my interest."
1,"Read, Revile, Discard","After hearing 'the buzz' on this book, it sounded right up my alley - my favorite genre of writing is food, with travel a close second, and the idea of reading of a personal journey toward spiritual growth seemed a great way to begin the new year. Well, it is a great way to start the new year - just not with this book.Right from the get-go, I was struck with Ms. Gilbert's selfishness and self-absorption, glaringly evident in the handling of her marriage and life, in her 'me, me me, poor little me' tone. In her writing, this quality does not diminish throughout her journey; conversely, it gets stronger with every page, ad nauseum.If your stomach is strong enough for a dose of flagrant self-aggrandizement, buy this book and a roll of Tums. If not - don't bother."
1,"Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia","DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This book is not worth buying. It's a story of self loathing. The book is stuffed full of self pity. The author writes page after page about how depressed she is and how bad her life is. She is shallow, and I got tired of the book after only a few pages. The author spends the whole book feeling sorry for herself for NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN SHE GOT A DIVORCE AND SPLIT WITH HER BOYSFRIEND. The author is PETTY AND SHALLOW and has no clue about what a really bad life is like. I feel like I got burned for my money with this one."
1,annoying read,"The author doesn't venture beyond her own world and perceived woes, despite her travels. Comes off as self-absorbed and shallow. A disappointing read."
1,Not written in a Godly way,"Well,,this is not what I think God had intended for us Christ Followers to read. It's about love more than a godly woman,,I feel. I Would not recommend to a Christan woman of faith."
2,"culture depictions perfect, but author is whiny.","I read this while I was living in Italy, and I loved her detailed depictions of the country and its people. They were absolutely spot on. But her whiny tone and simplistic writing style really got in the way of the rest of the book. Worth a read for some of the entertaining moments, but I wouldn't ever bother reading it again."
2,Pretty average...,Story was kinda slow. Don't see what all the hype is about. Even watched the movie and found that quite a drag. Won't recommend it.
2,Not what I expected,"This book was quite a bit more boring than I expected. I began reading it a few days before I left for my trip to Italy, hoping to get a surge of energy for the trip ahead. I attempted to read it on the plane but was so uninterested that I could not finish the book. It lacked substance. There was no exciting, high point of the story. I felt that I was being dragged along through this boring trip. A trip to these places is something that many people will never do in their lifetime. I think that is why this book drew the attention of so many people. Books are supposed to be exciting and take you to places you'll never see. But after reading it, I was not impressed. I was hoping for a wild journey of a woman finding herself. I did not expect it to be so shallow and uninteresting. It did not give me the inspiration I was hoping for."
2,review,"This book was okay. Kinda slow at parts, and I got irritated with her because I felt like she was constantly having to justify everything she did."
4,Eat Pray Love,"I found this book to be thought provoking. It showed me, even though, I am a member of a main line Prostetant Church there are many ways God can and does speak to us.It reaffirmed to me I have to keep an open mind and not judge others when their means of seeking God is different from mine.I would recommend this book for reading with an open mind to gleem widsom from it, which I certainly did.The author has a wonderful way of putting her insights on paper to keep one totally engaged."
5,Beautiful,"Absolutely fantastic. It's insightful, poignant, spiritual and very funny. The author is painfully honest yet objective in her experiences, proud of her accomplishments of self (as she should be), yet self-depreciating enough to be extremely likable. Highly recommended."
3,An interesting read...but overrated,"I have to agree with the reviewers here who find the writer self-absorbed & whiney. I've never read any of her other books. The section on Italy was fantastic (thus the 3 stars), however it took some effort to get through the part on India - what a dreadfully boring experience. Anyone who needs to spend several months in seclusion thinking of no one but themselves has got bigger...well, I'll leave it at that. And I was somehow disappointed that she got involved in a relationship & got married in the final third of the book - totally defeats the purpose of the journey and in my opinion put her back at square one. I was hoping for more of a travel memoir, and less of an ego-centric rant."
2,Overrated,This book started off great and the first section of the book definitely delivers. It's a blast to live vicariously through her as she enjoys the pleasures (minus one significant one) of Italy. The second section really gets bogged down in an uninteresting and even a bit hokey trip to an ashram. The third section picks up a bit but the book starts to feel too much like a personal diary and has nothing profound to say. My interest and the strong writing both seem to peter out as the book goes on.
2,self-absorbed!,I really did not understand what all they hype was about this book. I found her to be very self-oriented and unrealistic about life. I just did not care what happened to this woman and could not believe her choices.
2,Not as good as the hype...,I concur with the other few reviews that this book is not as great as I heard it was. I heard rave reviews about this book at our Xmas book exchange party for our book club and was going to use it as my choice for the book club before I read it. It does start to drag in the middle and the author comes across as very indecisive and annoying. I had to put it down halfway through India.
1,A Fraud,"I want to express my thanks to the reviewers here who managed to soothe my Gilbert battered soul. This woman conveys about as much spirituality as the weeds in my garden. Somehow I did manage not to contribute one cent to her pocket, got it from the library, and then insisted I see it through to give the presumed knowledgeable reviewers a chance. I have generally viewed them with some skepticism, much preferring reader reviews to the ""experts."" I think I'm vindicated.By the time this con artist wants us to believe that she finds ""love"" between the sheets and commonplace lust and sex, I was ready to pay my own price on the bathroom floor. Now she is apparently writing a book about marriage. Will the public wake up to this cheat posing as a writer only to end up demeaning the written word and our intelligence?The good that can come of this is that we may just turn into our own reviewers and learn to see through the deception, hype, and hoopla."
2,The book that WOULD NOT end - hated the political comments,"I agree with some others - I thought it was a self indulgent trip with lots of money for a book that was to be written ( and a movie somewhere in the works). I did not like her political ""anti-president"" comments - very obvious she was a far left liberal. I have a friend that always asks - ""what book are you reading now?"" and i say - still, the book that wouldn't end. I wanted to get through it - thinking that there must be something wonderful in it - I""m just not there yet. Well, I'm done with the book and it never happened. The book was just OK for me - I'm glad I can finally move on to something new!!"
2,Didn't live up to its hype,"after hearing so much about this book as the best thing written in years, i was somewhat disappointed. it's a good travel story and a nice read about one woman's journey into and then out of herself, but i'd prefer anne lamott anyday."
3,More whine with your cheese?,"I thought I woudn't make the first 80 pages... the main character is hanging for sooo long on her whining habits that I felt often compelled to trow the book in the trashcan! Hopefully, I got to the Indonesia part and after thaat the book was a real breeze."
5,self-indulgent read,"Although the author is quite self-indulgent, you can't help but love her. I would guess that women everywhere (and some men) will envy the total abandonment of responsibility and the submergence into the soul. Every other paragraph made me laugh out loud. I would recommend this book to anyone over 25."
4,"Well worth reading, especially if you're a 'spiritual seeker'","Eat, Pray, Love is a great read. Elizabeth's journey from suburban 'shoulds' to freedom is inspiring and gratifying. Her journey from tears to joy will give you hope for your own journey. There are some parts of the book that lack the punch of other parts, but whose life is pow, pow, pow all the time? This book is really worth investing your time in. I hope, like me, you'll come away from it thinking more deeply about life, choices and the courage that true freedom requires."
1,Don't Bother,"I only was able to read half of this book, before I moved on to another book. This book was soooooo self absorbed that it was irritating. I can not understand all of the hype that Oprah gave this book. Usually the books she recommends are a lot better than this. By the time I read half way through her trip in India, I could not stand another minute of her egotistical chatter. Do yourself a favor, skip this book all together."
1,Couldn't relate,I'm sorry but I couldn't even get half way through this book. I couldn't relate to the main character finding her selfish and spoiled.
4,A satisfying trip,"Interesting, insightful and honest. Easy to read. Women are often accused of being self-absorbed when they simply are living for themselves. Who else should she live for? Self-centered is not a bad thing, if the self is striving for truth and happiness. And look what she achieved in the process: a home for her Balinese friend, a book enjoyed and loved by many (even if reviled by some), enriching experiences for herself and many of the people with whom she formed bounds on her journey. Would her time have been better spent working for a corporation, having and caring for a baby she didn't want? Being true to yourself seems a better choice."
2,Why so popular...?,"As I read this book, I could not figure out why it was so popular among the masses, and why it has spent so much time on the bestseller list.But upon a quick internet search, I learned the reason why...it's been blessed by the hands of the almighty Oprah.The book is o.k., but definitely nothing spectacular. People, wake up...think for yourself, make your own decisions. Oprah could recommend Webster's Dictionary and it would land on the bestseller's list tomorrow. Sad. This says so much about the state of society today.Also sad is how many people apparently connect with this very needy writer. Strong women can live without a man (and I'm a man)...but this author can't get them off her mind. Be an individual for godsakes."
4,Deeply revealing and compelling,Gilbert posesses a unique voice that brings her readers into an intimate journey alongside her. This book captures what it is to be a woman who seeks more than materialism in these modern times.
5,I laughed and cried with Liz & you will too,"I really have enjoyed this book, although I started it after the KITE RUNNER (which was the best book I have read in years) and didn't think it would even compare. Well it doesn't compare because it would be ""apples to oranges"" but each book in its own right is FANTASTIC! I am now in the last 1/4 of this book (finally) and have to say that I got curious about the author's other books and her personal life outside of what was revealed in this book so I checked out her website here and read the FAQ which were fascinating and well worth the read.Eat, Pray, Love: One Woman's Search for Everything Across Italy, India and Indonesia"
1,Waste of Money,"I'm sorry I wasted money and time reading any of this book. Luckily I only read half of it before I decided that I could not spend any more time on the thoughts or words of a self-absorbed, spoiled brat. I'm truly in shock that this is selling so well. It is drivel."
1,"boring, self absorbed...","She really has a cushy life - how many people could take a year off to 'find themselves', especially in their middle thirties? She eats her way through Italy and gains weight - but hey, she NEEDED to gain as her terrible ex-husband had made a real stink about the property division, and she had lost weight worrying about this. No one else has ever had divorce problems. Well, not like hers as she is so special. She then goes to India to live in an ashram - a Special ashram where only a few people are allowed, by appointment - to 'find God', who is actually revealed to her... (did I mention she is special?) I think she was going on to the gorgeous island of Bali, where she was to find True Love, but I got so bored at this point I took it back to the library. She complains and complains about how bad her life has been. Well, everything is relative but to most people, her life is cushy."
1,Deeply disappointed!,"I was so excited to read this book after hearing good things and then seeing the author on Oprah. HOWEVER, shortly into the book I noticed a political reference that had no relevance to the particular point the author was making. It was a let down, but I moved on. Several pages later yet another political reference...this time much more critical and again totally lacking importance to the topic at hand. I couldn't help but drop the book to my lap, taking several minutes to decide whether I even wanted to continue reading. This is an excellent writer, she had me salivating at her brilliant style...till she had to infuse her political barbs (which I found insulting!). I don't care what her personal political beliefs are, just wish she would have kept them to herself! I read for PLEASURE...if I want to read about politics, I'll choose a book on that subject!"
1,My Selection for Stinker of the Year,I completely agree with the other reviewers who found this woman's self-indulgent drivel unbearable. I made it halfway through the book before giving up.
1,Beyond self-indulgent!,"...Well, I was advised to read Eat, Pray and Love over the Holidays. I was thrilled to hear it was a national best seller...that is, until I reached a third of the book. I couldn't understand what the ""all consuming crying"" was all about. While living a life most people dream of, traveling to exotic lands, eating foods unknown to 99% of the world's population, and about as care free as you can imagine, what's the problem? No responsibilities beyond which musuem she's going to and how many hours she can pray, her incessant self-absorbtion was unbearable!My way of learning is to gain great knowledge and wisdom from the greatest teachers, of which she is not. I place her on the very bottom of the list of people I'd like to learn from. Not recommended at all!!"
1,"Self-absorbed, Save the Politics","I was turned off by her politics, spilling into many areas of her book about HERSELF. I agree with the person who advised to check it out from the library and save your money."
2,"me, Me, ME!","Which was the ""me decade""? Was it the '70s or '80s? For Gilbert it's apparently never ended. Even when she is being altruistic. Did anyone ever experience a bad divorce before, or have a relationship end badly? Poor, poor me. The solution: get a book contract and spend a year in exotic places finding yourself and a new husband. Not a bad gig if you can get it. But I did like the descriptions of Bali."
2,disappointed,"with the intriguing title and description of this book, i felt the actual prose fell short of delivery. annoying rhetoric kept me skipping through the book hoping to get to the better part."
3,"Eat, Pray, Love","Given the rave reviews, I started this book with much anticipation and excitement. Maybe that was the problem...while I enjoyed the book and admire the author's personal journey, I cannot proclaim it ""my bible"" or ""the book that turned my life around"". It did allow me to see how fortunate I am in my life and maybe that was all it was meant to be."
1,Self-absorbed,"I found this book well-written but completely self-absorbed. Having traveled extensively myself, I found her writings about other culturesto be naive and patronizing at best."
2,"Me me me, I I I","It is hard to get into this book when the author tells us that she got tired of her husband so she divorced him. COME ON! And then she sleeping with another man while not yet divorced from her husband. What the heck!!!???!!!Then she says that God is not necessarily the God of the Bible.Finally she decides to sleep with a man in Bali but never marry him.AARRGHH!!!If you have a Christian worldview, you will not like this book."
1,"Frustrating, uninspiring - boo!!!","Somewhere around page 187, the author vows that she will stop talking about herself. I looked up at my companion and said, ""Oh, if only that were true."" I have never, ever, even when some part of me is screaming to just ""put the book down"", quit on a book. Often, I've regretted it, but I always like to give the book every chance. This one is testing me. Incredibly self-centred, self-pitying, self-indulgent...it's got the unbelievable plot line of every romantic daydream - oh, I'd love to run away from life and live in Italy, study in India, romp in Bali. What's this? I can get an advance to pay for just that? How convenient! And when I come home, they'll hire Julia Roberts to play me? How apropros. How sickening, more like. So, so, sorry I picked this up, and wasted the days I did on it. Boo."
1,"Eat, pray, and self indulge","Honestly with so many books, and so little time, I couldnt truly receommend anyone waste time on this drivel, albeit well written. It is trite, self indulgent and neither provocative nor engaging. GReat work if you can get it though!"

1,You're kidding right?,"I bought the Kindle ""no book priced over 9.99 - ever!""I wanted to read this book and was willing to pay $9.99 before I went to see the movie.No Way!Amazon - you disappoint me - I was on your side - thought you had GREAT product. I even bought Kindles for friends! Now I've got an overpriced piece of electronic reading machine!Publisher - I'm not going to read the book - just wait for the movie on Red Box.I'm NOT of WalMart pricing mentality - just want what I researched and was ""promised"" in this e-reader."
1,WOW! Never heard someone complain SO VERY MUCH!,"Bought this book, as heard it was good, well about 50 of the 334 pages are actually good. Who does the author think she is, a Saint? Hint if all you want to read is someone endlessly complain about everything under the sun, then you will LOVE this book. Actually this is so hard to read, bores you to tears and HINT here Saints DID NOT complain. Not only complaining, who told this writer she could even write? Her grammar is poor, the metaphores make no sense, the descriptions leave you lacking that the entire Italian trip had me hating Italy...and I used to love the place. The movie on imdb does not sound like this book and let's hope they are throwing million of dollars away on a better story, this is just HORRIBLE. A very, very, very poorly, badly written book. I really want my money back!"
1,Boring,"Wouldn't recommend this book to any friends. Too many uses of the word ""I"" coming from a mentally challenged woman, extremely selfish in nature. Boring. Also, having been in 2 of the countries she spoke of, I do not agree with her opinion on life there.Yes, I too am a female."
1,Did not even finish it as it is so annoying,"Yes, I know memoirs are by their nature focused mainly on one person...Unfortunately, the person in this case is way too self-absorbed and whiny for my taste. It seems the author got paid in advance in order to fund her trip....And the itinerary felt like a gimmick. I quit the book half-way through, as I really could not stand anymore of the privileged author's writing. I did take a peek at the end, which made me like the book even less--so she goes on this trip to find herself....And ends up rolling around with a hunky island man. Love indeed..."
2,Fair at best,"This is a readable book and I don't want to give the impression that it isn't. However, it is one of those non-stories we run into too often. Written from the author's point of view, she is not a likable character. She is a frustrating, confused person which, if she did not take herself so seriously and spend her life looking for easy spiritual solutions, she might seem sympathetic. The only parts of the book I liked, thus two stars instead of one, were her rants on the horrors of divorce and what it means to loose everything when you are the one who created everything. If you are female, you might like it more. If you have an over-eating disorder, consider reading it. If you feel running from your problems is a solution, you will love it. The last few chapters are actually pretty good, if you make it that far."
1,"If you must read it, borrow, don't buy","Many book groups are reading this book, which is how I encountered it. It was a trial to get through. While I expected a book about a personal spiritual journey, I thought it would have relevance to most readers. This seemed instead to be a narcissistic exploration of the author's own emotional life. I wonder what a word count of the pronoun ""I"" would reveal? Her simplistic descriptions of the residents of India and Bali smacked of condescension. Read Greg Mortenson's Three Cups of Tea if you would like to read an inspiring encounter with another culture."
3,Quite boring at times,"I read this book from cover to cover, but certainly not without some trying. If you are searching for a read that you cannot put down, then this book is not it, in my opinion. It was actually tedious at times trying to stick with it, to get on to the next story. And, although I found the writing style wonderful, I found myself often bored silly, especially during her meditation days."
2,what a bore,"I was dying to read this after all the hype and had to special order it because my bookstore deemed it too hedonistic. That just increased the hype. Well, I was so bored. Poor lady rambled on endlessly and I took ages to finish it only because I was determined to get to Bali. I had to cheat and skim a lot while in India. Bali was much better but overall very disappointed. Year of Pleasures was a much better book."
5,Love this book!,Only heard about it after I saw an interview with Julia Roberts. But easy read and great story.
4,Entertaining and insightful...,"I was actually a little worried about this book at first, because it was looking a little like a feminist rant against society's married-with-children expectation for women. But Gilbert quickly turned introspective and philosophical, and ultimately the story becomes a journey that almost everyone can relate to on some level. After all, we all have our own version of crazy, right?Annnnnd, being a food blogger as well as a COMPLETE FREAK, I kept track of all the food she mentions in her ""No Carb Left Behind"" tour of Italy.Check out my site for the list of food and the full review: [...]"
3,Not 5 stars after all:,"I know other reviewers have given this book 5 stars - after all, I bought it on the strength of their recommendations. But I just didn't get that feeling. It was an adequate story, but I didn't feel particularly enamored of any of the characters. I was more annoyed by the heroine's fixation on the unobtainable Sebastian, and I wasn't necessarily convinced of her growing love for the hero, Evan. Some parts of the story were humorous, but I was in no way touched or moved. In short, a pleasant read, but no keeper."
5,One of three trading books you have to read!,"After reading two other books by Justin Mamis, I was excited to read this one.When to Sell: Inside Strategies for Stock-Market ProfitsandThe Nature of Riskwere two extraordinary books on trading. This author knows what he is talking about and really relates tough topics in an easy to read fashion.My opinion is if you trade, you need to read all three of these books.This book, ""How to Buy"", covers everything you need to make your decisions and pull the trigger on a trade. He explains what to look for, how to gauge the strength or weakness in a stock, how to gauge the attraction for other traders, and how to get in on that stock as it is being accumulated.Why would you buy a stock that may not do anything for you? Get one that is showing the signs of moving where you want it to go. Justin talks about buying sensibly and not emotionally. He also talks in depth about when NOT to buy. That topic alone could save you a fortune on your next stock pick."
4,"Great book, but NOT an update","There are no better market technicians than Mr. Mamis, in my opinion. He has been through it all, and his writings clearly demonstrate the truth of how the market works, and what any trader needs to do in order to make a go of it.That said, DON'T expect this book to be an update of the same book written, what, maybe 25 years ago. I had hoped to get his take on some of the gyrations that have occurred since the first book, but no luck. All that's different in this book is that he's written an updated preface. If you have the first book, keep it and enjoy it, but don't buy this one, it's 99.99% the same book. While the preface is nice, it certainly doesn't justify buying this book if you have the first edition."
2,Edited!,Loves the story very much but has been edited and dubbed were heavily destroyed the original story line. The voice actors for english dialoque sounds ok. I just hope there'll be a company that can re-release in uncut version with original language including subtitles.
4,A fair fable,"This charming story can be enjoyed in many ways. The first is simply as an exciting story, with star-crossed lovers, scheming rulers, and vast wars. Animation and artwork are quite good - it's twenty years old, as of this writing, but has lost nothing with age. At the next level it's a Romeo and Juliet story, but with startling differences in its denouement. Behind all that lies a thoughtful ecofable, all the more realistic as we put increasing demands on our water supplies.It's not a must-have for the anime fan, but very appealing anyway. You'll see some bloodless violence and romance that keeps its clothes on, but no truly disturbing themes. Enjoy!//wiredweird"
5,very neat movie.,"Intresting story that starts out light and gets deeper and more intwined as it goes along, if you like older anime films i would definitely check this one out."
5,It's a great classic,"I've been searching for my childhood's movies and this one is one of my favorities. Love the story and the anime, it's very original. I recommend to the anime lovers and good storylines."
3,This was rather depressing,This movie shows the tragicness of war and the pain of living withyour wrong actions.
4,cordwood book,"purchased the cordwood building book for my husband who was interested in the craft, and he enjoyed reading it. Likes it."
5,Great book,I have bought and read all that rob roy has wrote and I have never been let down. This book is an eye opener. I love it. I am happy to have and own this book. It is a must for my home.
4,dj headphones,"These are awesome headphones! The sound quality is very good, except if you're looking for noise cancellation headphones, these are not exactly the ones you'd want. When there isn't any sound on the headphones, you can hear muffled sounds.It has a great bass beat, many people who have posted before, said that it was too much, but I think it is the perfect amount.Great for music! I actually bought these for a video class, and they are great for the class and listening to my ipod!"
2,Not in Love,"I decided to throw a little money at some headphones. I should have thrown more, I guess. The overall sound is OK, if I don't move at all, and if I can get them settled right. They're made of the kind of plastic that makes it sound like you have a couple of stryofoam cups over your ears. The headband was designed for something not human; it sits all wrong. The pad is comfy, though. The earholes are too small for my ears, and I'm no Prince Charles, either. Again, though, the pads are comfy. The replaceable wires seemed like a great idea at first, but the way they poke straight down out of the bottom of the cup, they rub my clothing and make a scraping noise in the aforementioned styrofoam cups. I think I bought Sennheiser because of some vague idea that Germans are good at this stuff, but I think I'll try some other nationality next time. Kinda disappointed for the money."
4,Nice for the price,"I purchased these headphones for use at work - I need something to keep random noises out (co-worker chatter). These fit the bill quite well....they're a bit tight, so they keep out noise just by virtue of the fit. They're comfortable for the times I keep them on - a couple of hours at times. Sound is very nice - good bass without being boomy, mid and upper ranges are clear. I'm not quite sure about the construction - but so far there haven't been any problems. I did check some of the bose products, but I didn't find the headphones worth the price they're asking. To me - the EH-250 has been a good product for the price."
5,Your Makeover,"A breath of fresh air for the makeup-challenged! This book sets out simple ways for any woman to look her best, with a minimum of effort! Morgen guides us expertly, helping us to touch all aspects of our beauty, both inside and out. The photography is spectacular and unique for this type of work, her models and examples are as true as can be, and she clearly imparts her tremendous talent and flair for the art of looking your best! The pages are ""plasticized"" and the binding spiraled so that this book can be USED, everyday, and for any event. She is truly an artist! This book is a MUST HAVE for every woman, and an awesome gift!"
5,Morgen's makeup,"I don't own the book, yet, but I am familiar with Morgen's makeup and skincare tips and have found them very helpful. I love the natural look that she promotes. If you do, too, you may want to try some of her cosmetic products. You can find them on hsn.com. They are affordably priced and so very flattering. Just a little tip for those trying to simplify but still enhance their makeup routine. Good luck!"
5,"Quick, Simple, and Hassle Free",I've been waiting for something like this to come out. Its great if you're an athlete and you just want something to put on and listen to without having to worry about carrying something or dealing with wires. The one downside I found with this is that its difficult to transfer the mp3s to the card with Windows XP. But they have a patch at their website that makes it possible. I always look forward to running now. The sound is fantastic.
3,Question,"The technical info says that it can play over 2 hours of .wma files, but down further it says that it is not .wma compatible. Am I reading it wrong?"
1,Not as pictured,"The picture shows the dark blue plane, but it is the lighter one that we received. My grandson wanted the dark blue because he already had the light one. We are very disappointed and I have contacted the seller. Hopefully they will make it right. This is too expensive to keep if he already has it.Update....I noticed on this link they have changed the picture, but there is another one out there that shows the dark blue, but you also get the lighter one."
3,Good but not her best,"My favorite Annie Ross album is out-of-print: A Swinger, with Zoot Simms. That said, this isn't too bad. She doesn't hit it out of the park, but the arrangements and orchestration are fine. With limited vocal range, Annie depends on emotional impact to win you over. Her best stuff is out-of-print, though, alas."
3,Homeless for the Holidays,"This movie is a bit amateurish, but has a great message for Christmas. It is a wonderful movie to watch as a family and reinforces the true meaning of Christmas."
2,wiggles,"The acting just was not that great in it. The best scenes came towards the end of the movie. Unfortunetly, I am not sure how many people will sit through the movie long enough to see them. It is a wholesome movie that anyone could watch, just not the best production dealing with the issue of homelessness. I felt it really down played how rough losing a job and ones home can be. I guess I was just expecting a different type of movie."
3,fairly good movie,I had not seen this one before but it's kind or ok. I don't think I'd pack up the kids and take them to the theater to see it but it has warm and fuzzy feelings for the whole family sitting in their living room and watching while sipping hot chocolate.
5,I was published in this book,"This book is wonderful. I had one of my Poems Published in the book. The Poem was called ""The Field"" by Jacob Boswell (Me)"
2,Bland Initial Effort,"The first Bombers album, released in 1978, contains an uneven and mostly ineffective set of songs aimed at the dance floors. The group's members included Gino Soccio and Denis Lepage, who would soon go on to other projects to much greater success. Westend Records, the original U.S. distributor, released the tracks ""Mexican"" and ""Dance Dance Dance"" in 12"" format for the discos. They garnered some airplay but are not especially strong cuts. The other tracks on the album fare even less well. The group seemed to be making instrumental rock songs with a danceable beat; this didn't really work. The follow up album showed great improvement."
1,not as nice looking as the photo,"I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking.It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking."
5,Great family fun,"Daniel Boone - Season One & Two (2 pack)These are good family fun and always interesting. The history might be a bit of a stretch, but we're enjoying seeing these old favorites after all these years. An actor I worked with once is one of the Indians in seven episodes of the second season, and it's quite a hoot to tell my kids ""see that redskin? I worked with him!"""
5,Christmas gift,"I bought this item as a gift for my husband and it came on time and all looked great until he discovered it did not have disc 1 & 2 instead it had 2 of 7 & 8 what a dissapointment, and could not exchange it , only refund which we did not want. So we dont have the full season set."
5,The best 25 hour entertainment you can get!,If anyone is a fan like me you will like this. I thought id seen all the shows on Tv derange. But there were a lot on there I have never seen before. Highly recommend and great for family days together. Very fun and never dull. Thanks.
5,Daniel Boone Season Two Review,Great quality DVDs. Daniel Boone TV Series is great for the whole family. Our kids love it and we do too.
2,no subtitles,"I ordered these two wonderful movies to show to my students in French. I assumed there would be subtitles for the less advanced students, but there were none. It would have been more helpful if this fact had been made explicit by Amazon. ""French only"", to me, implies that there is no dubbing."
4,Charming film,"These are charming films. I got them on the advice of a French friend and was not disappointed in the least. There are no subtitles, a lack mentioned by many others, and with a tiny bit of high school French as the only thing to draw upon I would have been completely lost (hence the 4 stars rather than 5) except that I had read the books in English and loved them. The films keep pretty close to the books and therefore it is not too much of a stretch to follow along even if one is not fluent in the language."
2,DVD's weren't in the case when I opened it up.,"So I'm sure that this show is awesome, however I am not particularily happy about opening the package up only to find that ALL 3 dvd's were missing. This is the first time I've had a problem with Amazon. I plan on returning the item for a replacement and hopefully this time I get what I paid for. I am currently deployed so trying to find time to get to the post office with my schedule is going to be rough. Thanks Amazon."
5,Love it,I love reality TV and I love this series! As a lesbian I was so pleased to see a show that shows all different types of lives we live. I love this show and can't wait for season 3 to come!!!
3,First wash and the colors bleed.,"I love the colors and the design of this quilt,but I had to wash it before I could put it on my bed,since I have a baby and the colors bleeded into the whites. The stitching is not the best quality (made in China)."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"You can see other colors beneath the white sections like the wrong color threads were used or pieces of material and the colors run when the quilt is washed. Even though it was suppose to be brand new I had to resew many places before it could even go on the bed.P.S. When we washed the quilt it also ran. We decided to wash the quilt again with SHOUT COLOR CATCHER. The first time the dye-trapping wash cloth came out very colorful, the second time the cloth came out it was a little less colorful, the third time it come out with out any dye on it at all. The box has 24 cloths in it and I was prepared to use them all if I had to but three times seems to be the charm. It does not take care of the whole problem but it is greatly improved and the quilt is back on our bed. Good Luck. For us it was worth the cost of the Color Catcher."
4,Pretear Vol. 4,"Pretear Himeno Awayuki and the Leafe Knights are doing their best to defeat Takako, Princess of Disaster, and her demon hordes. However, Takako has transformed Mawata into the Puppet of Darkness, the power source for the Great Tree of Fenril, which will destroy the Earth! To prevent the apocalypse, Himeno and the Knights must rescue Mawata and stop the Princess of Disaster once and for all. Will Himeno's love for her family, friends and the Knights be enough to save the world? Or will the power of evil vanquish love? Don't miss the amazing final installment of Pretear!"
3,I'm taking it back.........,"It seemed great at first. The mattress is high quality and firm but not to firm. The vibrations are soft and soothing. Easy to turn off and on. It made a nice humming sound, and then..... it made a horrible clanking sound! The vibrator is hitting the metal coils inside and there is no way to make it stop. The only thing I ever disliked about it was the vibrations only lasted 15 min. It should have gone for 30min. I'm so sad, I loved this mattress, so did my baby. Mybe you will have better luck if you try."
5,"Leisha Joseph, one of my favorite Authors","My review is based on, not only the book, but on reallife events that me and her have faced together. Hi, im the stepdaughter of Leisha Joseph. I'm not only giving the book 5 stars because she's my stepmom but, because i have read the book, and it seems, even to a 13 year old like myself, interesting. I think she deserves the 5 stars for, all the hard work she's ever done in her life. Writing a book, writing tons of childrens books like her new Christmas one that just came out. Basically, going on with her life no matter what challenges lie ahead of her, Leisha, is the most loving person i have ever met."
3,Not enough information about her rape recovery,"Being a rape survivor myself, I am always looking for books on the subject - specifically books written by survivors. The major part of the book was about her childhood. A small section was devoted to actual rape recovery - not a lot of detail. A Christian perspective on sexual assault is hard to find and she does a great job of showing that her faith is what carried her through the rough parts. The book was easy to read and I do commend Leisha Joseph for being brave enough to share her story with the rest of us."
3,"hard life, many rewards","Hurrah to Leisha for trusting God in the worst possible moment of life, being physically assaulted at gunpoint.Wow, would I have the courage to do that? I hope I never find out. A story of a tragic childhood at the mercy ofa horribly mentally ill mom, and a dad who died one day at work. In my book, PLAYLADY, I tell of working withthe mentally ill, and this book shows how that looks in the home, not in the mental hospital. Well written, I wouldrecommend it."
4,gift to my self,I love Patsy Clarmont's books on Tea and serving tea. She brings a sweetness to the party and I often give this as a gift to other women who enjoy the lovely event of a tea.
2,1st neosporin lt lip balm,"This was one of the first lip treatments Neosporin made. I bought it hoping it would give the results it promised and I hoped for. Sadly it didn't give the results I hoped for. It may have worked for others, but not for me. It goes on really thin and I had to reapply within 15-20 minutes later. This cycle was repeated until I went and bought another lip balm. If you need relief from dry lips, I would personally forgo this product and try something different."
1,Unwatchable Garbage! Don't Throw Your Money Away!,"I have no problems with ""non-offical"" or grey market video material - especially if it's the only way to see a rare film. But this version looks like 20th generation from a VHS tape that was recorded on a VCR with dirty video heads. I bought this and Untamed Youth -- both are horrible quality and both were returned to Amazon for a refund. I'm surprised Amazon peddles this 3rd party junk. If you want excellent quality of this and similar titles, type the movie title name, followed by the the words, ""movie dvd"" into Google and you'll find a site that specializes in all the great 50s & 60s rock and roll movies."
5,Same as poster,"I got them for the same reason as the posters. My sister is in the movie, and that is her on the box."
3,Where is the Pristine Version?,"I saw this movie for the first time about 10-15 years ago on either AMC or TCM. it was an absolutlypristine, fine grained print that looked like it was just filmed. Buddy Rogers (Mary Pickford's Husband) produced it, I believe, and perhaps the rights are still being withheld - too bad - but this is better than nothing..."
3,Check Silver Edition,Silver Edition has all the games from 2nd & 3rd edition for the same price or less.
2,Entertaining RPG,I thought this game was good but it is also boring. You get three games and that is cool but the graphics on 2 of the games really suck and the third is just o.k. If you dont mind using the keyboard to move the guys than this game is for you and buy the game even if you don't like using the keyboard. P.S. It is entertaining.
2,Almost Pulled It Off,"I picked the book up because I wanted to see if the author could pull this story off in a believable way. I think he missed the mark, at least with me. The characters where out of a bad 1950's B movie and this lack of character depth plus the far fetched story did not get enough credibility with me. There are many other books out there that a much better, reread a Clancy if you can find nothing else."
4,Fascinating,"A classic work which I'm embarrassed to be reading just now. Newbigin's book is a treatise on understanding and living Christianity in an age of pluralism, and his primary argument is that the Christian faith is both contextual and relatively understood as well as universal and intended as truth for all. He bases his argument in a comparison with science, arguing that faith and science are both ways of knowing that have their own fundamental assumptions. In this way, he attempts to demonstrate that Christianity is not just a matter of subjective belief opposed to reason but a different, equally valid set of lenses just as reason and science are.Newbigin is fascinating and it's hard to pin him down. Every time he said something that I didn't buy or thought I disagreed with, I then couldn't find a way to refute it."
5,Great Survey of PoMo Situation and What the Church Must Do,"Lesslie Newbigin is one of the best thinkers on the subject of how the church must respond to the new context of post-modernity. He surveys the landscape well and integrates the widely dispursed factors and brings it all to the practical level of congregational ministry. If the practical is in the form of a challenge and not specific action to take, it's only a loss to the reader because Newbigin, who died in February 1998, will not write a follow up. This book is a must read."
5,Profound and eye-opening,"Newbigin has a gift for making the profound understandable and the complex accessible to the lay reader and the church professional. This is must reading for anyone who is serious about evangelism in our pluralistic, post-modern society."
5,Newbigin's book is a must-read for Western Christians,"Newbigin was a British missionary to India for 40 years. As he traveled between India, with its many religions, and the West, with the increasing number of personal religions of non-religion, he had an excellent perspective on how Christianity fit into the cacophanous jumble of religious diversity. Newbigin deals head-on with many issues that American and other Western Christians have trouble with, the greatest being, ""How can we claim that Jesus is THE way, THE truth, and THE life when we see so many good people who have alternative belief systems?"" This is a book that will challenge Christians to take courage."
5,Christine RULES!!!,"This is a powerful book about a transwoman who has suffered, prospered and soared. She is now happily post op and is doing alot of work for glbt rights. Highly recommended. Best book since Caroline Cossey's MY STORY."
2,expensive for the quality.,"It is the most difficult thing to find good melon seeds in US.. I gave this a chance because of the option of returning to Amazon. the seeds are packed well, taste freshly roasted, little salted, so fantastic taste on the outside, but the inside is almost empty, nothing, very thin and no taste.since the price is not cheap I am returning them..."
3,"Good, but not great.","This is a suitable textbook for an introductory class on world prehistory. Comrehensive in scope, it goesd from australopithecus to the pre-contact in the New World. Wenke's writing is simple and straightforward, so even generalists with no archaeological background will be able to follow easily. The writing is even occasionally enlivened with Wenke's oft-present sardonic wit, although this falls flat a lot of the time. However, the sheer timespan covered by this text prevents it from going into any interesting detail, leaving the surface barely scratched. While easy to read, it's of less use, the further up one goes in the field of archaeology. It's also rather difficult to take notes from, and contains pages of daunting, unbroken texts. Some neat charts to break up the flow would help students. Perhaps because I have gone beyond this level now, I'm an arky snob, but I was less than impressed with this book."
5,We can all benefit from more Umoja,"This is a great way to introduce children to other cultures, and specifically to Kwanzaa. One child, excited about celebrating Kwanzaa, learns that it is not about just her, but about Umoja or unity with others."
4,An excellent book if you have never read Ambrose!!!,"Stephen Ambrose is an excellent writer and historian. I love all of his work!!. The best part about this book are his experiences in Whitewater, WI. He is revered in this town because of what his father and family have given this city. My only problem with the book is Ambrose recycles a lot of material (see Kirkus review) from his previous books. The stories about his relationship with his Father is excellent reading. Dr. Ambrose was an outstanding person!!. Comrades does not stack up to previous books but if you are an Ambrose fan like myself... it is worth the money. This is not his best work but it does outshine other books I have read this year."
4,Interesting introductory reader of other Ambrose books,"If you have read several of Stephen Ambrose's books, you will be reading excerpts from several of them in this short compilation-style book. There are some new chapters that deal with people Ambrose has been freinds with for several years, but the overall goal of the book is to allow a reader to see the value of bonds of friendship among men in history. Examples include Dwight and Milton eisenhower, people of Easy Comapny (Band of Brothers), Custer and Sitting Bull, and others. This moves quickly, since it is not in-depth, and can be read in one evening if really attempted. The writing is sharp and lyrical, well-done, but readers should not expect a thick, detailed effort more common in all of Ambrose's works. Call this one the greatest hits, or even the ""flashback"" book, such as TV shows use to look back on their long run of shows and their favorite moments."
1,Give it a 10.0 on the creep-out scale,"This might be the creepiest book I have ever read. Actually the only thing preventing it from being the creepiest book I have ever read is the fact that I have not read it. My friend warned me about how touchy feely this book is. The only items in the index were hugging, embracing, males, awkwardness, and heebie jeebies. When I found out that the book had actually offered to give my friend a back rub, I decided it would be best to blacklist this book."
4,very well written,"This book is definitely not as scholarly as Ambrose's other works, but it is a wonderfully written collection. Through his research, Ambrose learned much about men and how they formed friendships with others. Definitely worth reading."
1,A disappointingly short and shallow volume,"I'm in agreement with other reviews, that this work has nothing new to offer. Each chapter leaves you flat, where you want more detail. The book never deals directly with the very core of male relationships, but dances around the issue with overly simplified anecdotes from key figures' lives."
4,True Teaching of the History of Friendship,"Stephen Ambrose extracts Famous and Not-So-Famous friendships from the archives of time, and uses History to teach a valuable lesson. Ambrose demonstrates that great people in History have overcome great obstacles, bolstered sometimes only by the loyalty of close friends. His chapter on Veterans was particularly inspiring, especially in his description of how two former Allied Soldiers -- one of whom was Richard Winters of Easy Company -- verbally defended a lecturing former German World War II officer from the ignorant accusations of a self-righteous student years after the war. Also inspiring was the chapter on the friendship of Lewis and Clark, as well as that of the lasting effects of the bonding of the men of Easy Company. This is a wonderful work."
3,A Little Diffirent,"This is an easy, one day read about friendships. Not a bad book, but we are so used to the brilliance of Ambrose that we, or me anyway, may have had higher expectations than this book brought. It was a pretty good read, but most of all it made me want to read more of some of the friendships included. I'm an Ambrose fan so am glad to have this effort in my library."
4,You get what you expect,"The oil is purple, but after a few miles of use will turn black. But it's not really a problem since I doubt your going to be glancing at your gear oil everyday. The oil it's self has so far served me we'll. Regular maintenance (Around 50,000 miles, with no mechanical design deficiencies shouldn't be a a stretch.) The oil it's self (like any good gear oil with anti-wear properties) smells just like rotten eggs (because of the ZDDP,a antiwear compound, which contains phosphorous) so be sure and use wear old clothes when you change the gear oil."
4,Great quality and no diff whining,"Don't know why others have problems with the RP diff oil but I have had it in my M3's diff for the past 30,000 miles and I have no complaints whatsoever. The oil that was in before made the diff whine at certain speeds and it was pretty noticeable. It did go away after I put the RP in and I haven't had any problems since. I love RP and use throughout my car from engine oil to diff oil I recommend it."
5,Very pleased,"I wanted to change out my rearend fluid on my GTO at 32,000 miles and had heard so much about Royal Purple fluids that it was time to try it. Did the change and right away noticed a big difference in less noise coming from the back of my car which had been an minor problem leading into this change. I'm so glad I switched to Royal Purple and will continue to use their products from now on."
1,This film is terrible.,"I was embarrassed when I actually showed this film to my 8th grade classes during our unit on The Pearl. It was a waste of time, simplistically pointless, and told us absolutely nothing about this wonderful author. THIS IS A MOVIE TO SKIP!!!!!"
1,Looking for a video about John Steinbeck? Keep looking!,"Thank you Mr. Fleck for taking the time to review this truly awful video. I've written a couple of ""sample"" reviews of this video, but I have yet been able to write one that is balanced in its presentation. Over the course of my twenty years of teaching I have viewed countless videos. This is the worst one I have ever previewed. Mr. Fleck's description of the video's content is painfully accurate and insightful. There is absolutely no reason to show this to students who hope to learn something useful and meaningful about Steinbeck. A Noble prize winning author deserves better!"
1,Horrible,"Hulk Hogan vs. Ed ""The Butcher Barber Bootie Zodiac Disciple Man"" Leslie Beefcake as the main event. That's enough to tell you that this was by far the worst Starrcade of all time. It really puts the legacy to shame."
2,Starrcade 1994 stunk overall,I would not recommend it. The only match really worth watching was johnny b badd vs arn anderson. The stupidest match was hogan vs butcher.
3,Lots of stars however matches are not top quality,"This Starcade is the first for Hogan as he takes on Butcher. Match leaves you needing something else. Also features Macho Man, Sting, and Mr. T."
2,2nd day of Christmas 2012 review,"On the 2nd day of Christmas 2012 I'm going to review...WCW Starrcade 1994. The United States title match between Jim Druggan & Vader was not great but pretty good. The Alex Wright-Jean Paul Levesque match while not a bad match,it was too long for it's own good. The Television title match between Johnny B. Badd & Arn Anderson was a solid bout even with the predictable ending. The Harlem Heat-Nasty Boys tag team match was a 15 minute non-ending psychologically mind-boggle. The Kevin Sullivan-Mr.T match was AWFUL! The Sting-Avalanche match was slow and also too long for it's own good. The Worlds title match between Hulk Hogan & Brutus ""The Butcher"" Beefcake was a limited move & predictable nightmare. I give this PPV a 4 out of 10."
3,a lackluster show,"it is okay, but not as bad as people say. it might be worth it, just for nostalgic purposes"
1,Sh**t-cade is more like it,"Hogan is just a pathetic wrestler, and whatever the ****his name is today is even worse believe it or not. It was nothing but a rehash of old WWF stuff that wasn`t that entertaining to real wrestling fans back in the 80`s anyways. The only reason I watched it, and gave it one star is because of Alex Wright vs. Jean Paul Levesque (Hunter Hearst Helmsley). That match was Ok, but I really just wanted to see an old match of Triple H."
3,"Good story, but not well written","This book has a basically good, if somewhat unbelievable, story. However, the writing is overdone. The author is overly in love with adjectives, similes, and other descriptive terms. Sections become very wordy. As other reviewers have indicated, the plot gets slow at times. In contrast to some reviewers, I did finish the book before writing a review, but I can't recommend it."
1,"Awful, awful, awful. Did I mention this book is awful?","This is the worst book I have ever come across. The story is not compelling after the initial event, the characters are not likeable and the author is one sick puppy with a predilection for describing gruesome crime scenes in excruciating details involving skinning and evisceration, over and over. In between, we are treated to boring conversations, boring philosophical musing and boring soliloquy. I suffered through three fourths of this abomination and finally gave up. The reader was not great either but at least he pronounced all the Italian words correctly."
2,Overly wordy and the ending made no sense...,"Ok, I can stand a wordy ""new"" writer but this book is over the top sometimes especially the first 150 pages. I agree with many of the other observations of this book and the whole Indian legend woven within the story seemed out of place, until you find out the killers motivations. Not really sure he chose ""now"" to act though as that's never really explained other than a tacked on last few chapters. I think some editor read the book and told the author that he never really explained why the first person was killed so go back and fix that...and he did...with some way out there explanation. I really wanted to like this book as I love spy/thriller types of books, but this one was a ""C"" as best. I'll probably read the next in the series to see if story telling improves, but I won't be buying the third book until after I've read the second one, that's for sure."
2,"Sounds like a great idea, BUT.......","It read on the back like a great book. Inside though is another story. I am halfway thru it and I have not seen him CLEAN anything. It is too slow, but I want to still read to find out what happens.It is a rough patch now but I am sloggin through. If it does not pick up soon I will give up.Welty69"
1,Kind of sick,Very gory and full of drugs. Big shots with foul language all over. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody.
1,A shame to find a hardcopy version at Walgreens for $5.00,"Love the concept of my kindle, but wish my husband had not bought it for me due to the unrealistic cost of books. Especially ones published years ago. Most of the free ones are worth exactly what you pay for them...nothing..."
2,Boring,This is just too boring and too drawn out to get even half way through the book. The main character is a drunk and a parinoid one at that. Not worth picking up much less reading.
4,A good one,"Though hefty, do not be discouraged by the size of this one. Wordy, but once the hook is set you won't put this down. Strong descriptive language takes us to various locales and shows some familarity with the world's different places. Tough action, tho some of it occurs off stage. A sharp eye, educated commentary and a wicked wit, help the reader along. Very enjoyable."
5,New Reader,"A different type of spy book, very much on the same vibe as Lee Child and the Reacher series. Very exotic locales"
1,want to forget it,"Echelon makes one think of security, government, encryption, eavesdropping. In this book there is some government.OK, so, onto the story... which I can not make out.I'm as much a fan of Carlos Castaneda (yes, same guy) as the next person, but this is not Castaneda-ish, or spy-ish or much of anything.Good luck to the readers."
1,Don't read this book,"This seemed like an author who watched every spy film ever made and decided to incorporate them into a novel. At first our hero is angry, solid, a spy, then he is hilucinating on peyote and doesn't know it. Would this happen to James Bond? I don't think so. At one point he is celibate for 10 years and the next he is lusting after an Italian woman whom he just met. I must admit that I only got about half-way through the book and decided that I couldn't handle anymore. If you can, good luck!"
1,Characters not very Culpable,It's very distracting & not feasible for a character to have visions and plot leads on peyote/mescaline incorporated in the main storyline. I was dissappointed & am sorry I used my rewards card for this book.
4,Nice Collection...,"This is a nice collection of footage - some never compiled to dvd, and some taken from other dvds. I like the commentary and thoughts shared by his wife and children in between most songs - it gave an extra depth to Harry and his music.NOTE: this was re-packaged and released again in 2009 as ""Harry Chapin - The Story of a Life"". At the time of this writing, Amazon has priced that dvd at about $10 cheaper."
3,i remember when the music ...,I was a big fan of Harry and I found the commentary interesting but I was disappointed that there were not more songs .
5,Harry Chapin - Remember When: The Anthology,"The anthology of Harry Chapin's musical stories brim with the soulful magic that defined a very unique master storyteller. This visual remembrance brings true life to timeless songs that still reach us in fresh ways. It is simply hard to imagine life without him, yet here he is with us again. As I listened and viewed Taxi I pondered what might have happened with the three of us in that car, as we drove another 20 years beyond Sequel. Somehow, I believe he would have found the words to warm our hearts and minds, and again fill our imaginations with these wonderful companions in our September days. His stories linger still...and that is a good thing. Thanks kindly Harry."
5,Excellant video!,Excellant video with commentary by Harry's wife and kids. Contains some of his best songs (in my opinion). A must for all of Harry's fans video libraries.
2,too little for the price,This book was purchased for non-credit class on the subject of cancer. I feel it is written for an introduction to the subject but does not give the class much to discuss. I would have preferred a text with much more content.
3,Some Good Info,"This book has some good information on both famous and lesser-known ""leaders of the German war machine"". However, I found many of the chapters dry and somewhat boring. Also, Lucas tends to focus on one battle or campaign rather than what a person did in their entire career. For example, Lucas spends most of his chapter on Erwin Rommel writing about Rommel's time in France in 1940 while breezing over his more famed time in Africa and his role in the Normandy campaign. Still, the book does give pretty good info on well-known leaders such as Sepp Dietrich, Albert Kesselring, Erich von Manstein, Walther Nehring, and Rommel, while also dealing with some lesser-known men such as August von der Heydte, Willi Langkeit, Hermann Ramcke, Lothar Rendulic, and Rudolf Witzing, among others. All in all, a decent effort by Lucas with some good info, but the writing is dry at times. One positive point is that the book has over 20 pages of very good photographs."
4,Anything By Wolf Is Marvelous!,"Heroic and villanic tortures or threatening bondages. It's very fancifull and creative. Some not-so-super heroines get into very stressfull and exposed situations. It's more bondage, comedy, and humor than it is erotic, but it is all a lot of fun. The drawing is not detailed but it is finished work, not sketchbook."
5,The Gift That Keeps on Giving,"I got this book for Christmas and have now loaned it out to four friends (and fellow Shatnerphiles). I hestitate to admit that there are things in here even I did not know about the Great God Shatner. Scary things. See the entry on ""nude scenes"" if you don't believe me. Highly recommended."
4,Blasphemy!,"An important, groundbreaking book. After reading some of the reviews posted here, I almost didn't plunk down my hard-earned green for ""Shatnerica,"" but I'm sure glad I did--the nay-sayers are all wet on this one.There are apparently no taboos for this author. A pull-no-punches, take-no-prisoners look at the Man, ""Shatnerica"" hits the bullseye. Shnakenberg loses a star for some assertions of fact that this reader found of questionable lineage, but overall, a fascinating read.CAVEAT: If you're looking for a read that handles Shatner with kid gloves; if your idolatry of all things Federation forbids the speaking of truth; if the man they call Kirk is your sacred cow; or if hard reality sometimes makes you cry, look elsewhere.However, if you seek the light of truth, and can accept that ALL men have darker aspects to their nature, check this one out.One question, Shnakenberg: when will we see ""Nemoyica""!"
1,Mean Spirited and Feeble,"I quickly read through this book and found some of the stories inaccurate. I originally picked up the book out of curiosity, but now I feel sorry for Mr. Shatner for having to endure idiots such as this author. I also feel a bit sorry for the author considering he actually thinks this passes as humor."
5,A reference book YOU NEED TO READ cover to cover!,"You would be hard-pressed to find a citizen of a developed country who does not know the name, ""William Shatner."" Equally difficult to find is a person who has come to terms with who Mr. Shatner is. Schnakenberg paints us a picture of the whole man. An adroit wordsmith, Mr. Schnakenberg crafts for us an important 20th century Pop-Culture reference book which lends itsself easily to reading from cover to cover. Never do we lose touch with the man's humanity. Schnakenberg's treatment allows us to look directly into the sun of a proud man's persona and not have our retina's scorched before we see the toupee. A very fair and even-handed and objective chronicle of Mr. Shatner's life. KUDOS, Schnakenberg!"
5,Breathtaking!,A fine slice of woodwork. Kudos to the author for tackling a subject he both cherishes and despises with wit and courage.
4,Armband Stays in Place!,"I love my armband. I was concerned because I have read that women have a hard time fitting into most standard armbands even with average arms, which I have. But this band fits great and stays put. The nice thing is that my husband can use it too because it's adjustable. Great band for the money for sure."
3,get what you pay for,"We purchased this (low cost) item and shipped it to our in-laws for our vacation/future visits. It worked out that it was cheaper to purchase this item than to rent one for the duration of our stay. The good news is the price, the bad news is the quality of the packnplay. I thought all Graco pack n plays were approximately the same but no. This model is of poor construction and probably wouldn't last regular heavy use; but, it did work for our needs so I can't fault it completely."
2,not a long term sleeper,We got this for our second child and subsequently used it while we were on vacation for her to sleep in. Our 14lb baby buckled the mattress after just one week. Not at all suitable for sleeping in. Otherwise pretty okay. easy to carry and wore well in the hold of the plane with one transit.
4,very basic,"This lightweight, inexpensive bag perfectly fits a 15.4"" Toshiba laptop. The padding seems adequate for basic protection, or for stowing a laptop inside a suitcase, but it's not going to withstand serious impact. The appearance of the bag is neutral and unassuming. Not ugly, but not in any way stylish."
2,Try Again,"I loved a cut on this album, so thought I'd give the CD a try. Very repetitive and boring. I was hoping for ambient and atmospheric but..... Please don't be fooled by one good track."
5,THE WISDOM OF BALSEKAR,"This is an excellent book for both newcomers to Advaita and those already familiar with the subject. The book is superbly edited together by Alan Jacobs, who has arranged it into alphabetical subjects, such as 'Enlightenment', 'Free Will', 'Happiness', etc. This makes it the perfect book for dipping into for inspiration. As a direct student of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, one of the most influential of modern Advaitists, Ramesh Balsekar must surely be essential reading for anyone interested in Advaita/Non-Duality. His knowledge of the traditional Advaita approach and his modern outlook combine to present the Advaita philosophy in a practical, liveable way for the modern reader. Highly recommended!(Roy Whenary - author of 'The Texture Of Being')"
2,This is the intellectual Ramesh,"Wayne Liquorman has said there are two Rameshes: the one who speaks academically in a public forum and the one who speaks much more personally one-on-one or to small groups. With The Wisdom of Balsekar unfortunately you are getting the academic Ramesh.I found this volume to be way too heady. If that is your thing, then you will probably have the opposite reaction to this book, but I did not enjoy it or take much away from it at all.If you want a more personable view into Ramesh's teachings, then I can whole-heartedly recommend Who Cares?!, linked below. (You can also check out my 5-star review of that one.)Who Cares?! The Unique Teaching of Ramesh S. Balsekar"
3,nofx is for posers but they still rock,they may not be the bouncing souls but you should still buy this cd I hate west coast punkers and I did.
4,Sarcasm Street,"NOFX may be my favorite punk band, just have to be in the mood for sarcasm as a way of life. I had the pleasure of hearing ""Pump Up the Valuum"" and ""The Decline"" first. The songs here still make me laugh (Dylan-esque intro to ""Perfect Government"") and agree with most of their sentiments (except ""Lori Meyers"" - she is not just selling her time). I think the playing one ""The Cause"" is pretty sloppy here - wasn't the band was into the song enough to get it right? However, it sure is great the way Melvin & Fat Mike trade off singing - I think Mike has opera in his blood.The great strength of NOFX is the range of songwriting; you don't get a CD with 9 similar songs in a row. But I wish the tunes would last a little longer. I'm just grooving on ""My Heart Is Yearning"" and - it's over. Not even a second verse. ""Lori Meyers"" - again - could easily go another verse or two. Inspired: ""Don't Call Me White"", Linoleum & ""The Brews""."
5,Probably one of the best punk rock albums,"This is probably one of the best punk rock albums in history. It captures the fully integration of El Hefe to the band and it's at its apex from beginning to end. It includes great tracks as The Cause, Linoleum, The Brews among many others wonderful songs.Historically it precedes the whole punk-wave that would end up so badly.Lyrically it's flawless, not as funny as later albums but still very strong and aggressive.Musically it just does not let you rest.Production-wise, it's very well done. It does not generate those disturbing distortions, basses out of tune or anything of that sort.It's overall a great album and a master piece in punk rock."
4,Awesome punk rock,"THis is one of NOFX's Best cds. I really like every song on this one , especially tracks 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12 and 16.A must for nofx fans and punk rock fans in general."
5,oi,"this is an awsome cd. u can listen to it all the way through and enjoy the whole thing. its fast and hard and has some of my favorite songs. one of the best cds from one of the best punk bands out there. so in other words, buy it! u wont be disapointed."
5,Punk Beginnings,"This was one of the three CD's that introduced me into the wonderful world of punk (Bad Religion's Stranger Than Fiction and Pennywise's About Time were the other two if you're curious). Demonstrating a rather impressive range of abilities, NOFX manages to throw up (almost literally) a great mix of songs ranging from goofy comentary (regular shoes) to mellow fun (together on the sand) to harshly introspective (Lori Meyers). There's more, but I guess that's the whole point isn't it? While this album isn't quite like they're earlier releases, it's well worth the buy. It's a classic punk in the annals of punk history."
5,Great CD from an awesome band,"Personally, NOFX is my favorite band, but this CD took more than one listen to convince me. It took at least 2 or 3 to dig all the songs, but now I listen to it regularly and it seems to get better each time I listen to it. It truly is an amazing CD from an amazing band. This CD proves that punk is the best form of music out there (next to ska, of course)."
5,There best to date,"This album has to be NOFX's best album yet. It has less atempts at ska (such as ""So Long And Thanks For All The Shoes"") it's less monotanous than ""White trash two heebs and a bean"" and has the best songs that they have ever put out. every song is an anthem"
4,another classic notched under their belt (thus again),this album is the kinda album where you can pop it in and in 5 seconds do a lesbian! all songs can be on a nofx classic album i mean why didnt they just called this one nofx classics?
4,"NOFX, the kings of Punk","This is the album that threw NOFX where they are: the punk rock elite! I personally didn't like that album that much, but like for Nevermind (Nirvana) that I also reviewed, this album is a classic, and every one should have it!"
4,"dont get me wrong, but i think they sound like the vandals?","will i getting weird commons by my freind. he tells me that they sound like the vandals. first of all, the vandals are really funny. i dont think that nofx have lyrics about, girls, weird people. and other funny lyrics."
1,"horribly bland pop punk, double bass fodder","i can't stand this band. this album is one of the most repulsive things to the punk rock community. this sounds exactly like the music they play on the disney channel tv shows, except with even worse lyrics. i also hate it when kids who skate and own this album run around claiming to be 'punker than thou.'"
1,"Punk isn't music,..","Nofx's ""punk in drublic"" is just like every other stupid punk rock band... It sucks. I dont see how this genre cna look at themselfes after listining to such disgrace.If you want real music ? Listing to some gore/grind! Punk rock blows."
5,Five years after buying this album it still never gets old,"This is my favorite punk album of all time because it encompasses everything I love about punk. This album has it all from politics on ""Don't call me white"", ""Perfect Government"" to goofy songs like ""Jeff wears birkenstocks to work"". The energy that comes out of this album is unbelievable. If you love loud fast and aggressive punk that doesn't get cheesy then this album is a can't miss."
4,CLASSIC NOFX,"NOFX is a great band , and this is a great album. ""Linoleum"" alone is the #1 reason to buy this album. But ""Lori Meyers"" , ""The Brews"" , ""Perfect Government"" , ""The Cause"" and of course ""Don't Call Me White"". But the reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of five , there are some songs I didn't care for mostly "" My Heart Is Yearning"" which is pointless , and annoying , and ""The Quass"" which is another pointless track , but every other song is awesome."
4,"Not a punk classic, but one of NOFX's best-defining records","Anyone who is into punk and has been buying a fair amount of punk albums has no doubt ran into the name NOFX, the favorite band of many modern-day punk rockers. Although this record may not show NOFX's best capabilities, it is important because it was a split from their older albums and style (e.g. Ribbed) and their newer and more sophisticated style. Linoleum is arguably the best NOFX song, and other gems such as Leave It Alone and Perfect Government are the highlights of this album. Like some of their very early albums such as Liberal Animation, these songs are more distinguishable from one another. Each has its own sound. Overall Punk in Drublic will never be considered to be as classic in the punk scene as albums such as London Calling by The Clash or Dookie by Green Day. Instead, Punk in Drublic will be remembered as one of the many reasons that NOFX as a band has been so influential to punk rock."
5,"The letter N and bands, Punk in drublic is a definite buy","Why is it that the letter N is the first letter of the two best bands in the world NOFX and Nirvana, but is the first letter of one of the worst bands nsync? Now that u thought about that the answer is just because, and that is why u should get Punk in Drublic, just because... it is the best album ever recorded. Just because it has chords that make your heart race, lyrics that not only have meaning but are really cool with puns that stimulate the mind, and a diverse selection of punk songs all on one cd doesnt mean u should buy it, u should buy it because u want to and because its just beyond belief in quality. Warning you may catch yourself playing air guitar in public places while listening to this cd but it is worth it (speaks from experience)also i recommend any other NOFX cd from Pump up the Valuum to SLATFATS"
4,This Is Good STUFF,i really like this cd. you may ask why i only gave it 4 stars but i guess i really give it a 4.5.... anyways.. This Cd ROCKS! great guitar riffs. everything is good. nofx owns. sorry my review is kinda lame but i got hw to do. ok.
4,DRunK iN pubLiC,"Most people say that this is NOFX's best CD, but not in my opinoin. Some of the songs are great, others are okay, but some are just pointless, like ""My Heart Is Yearning"". I also dont like the way that Fat Mike's voice sounds, it's really whiny and loud. Other than those things it's a great CD. In my opinion the best songs are ""Linoleum"",""The Cause"",""Don't Call Me White"", and ""The Happy Guy."""
3,Good...but Overrated,"Don't get me wrong, this is the first NOFX CD I bought, but I just think it's kinda...dull. Some of the songs (Leave it Alone, Punk Guy, Jeff Wears Birkenstocks, etc.) are awesome, but others are just repetitive. I still respect it for being their crossover album, but Pump Up The Valuum is still my favorite NOFX album."
5,One of the best.,"This album is definitely one of my favorite albums ever. My only complaint if that stupid my heart is yearning song. I always tend to skip that one. But i guess that every other song on the album makes up for it.Includes NOFX almost hits ""Linoleum"" and ""The Brews""!!!!"
4,"Unusual, but very good","I agree with most of the reviews that this is not for complete beginners, but I strongly disagree on the pronunciation issues brought up here. I've had a number of major revelations on pronunciation based on the opening chapters of this series. To speak any language without displaying a horrendously bad accent is extremely difficult and this series takes the bull by the horns. I believe the rapidfire speech on the CD's is intentional.I've also bought the 2nd 12 cassette course, which goes into the past tense. It is extremely good in many ways, but is not put together as nicely as the 1st...the book has a horrible font and the tapes refer to the wrong pages. Nevertheless it's indispensible to me at this point.I'm trying to find out if there is a 3rd course. [what about it, amazon? you don't even appear to have the 2nd, although your price is about $20 cheaper than what I paid at Border's for the 1st set]"
3,Thorough but dry and dull,"This is the big one. It will take you months to get through but by the time you are finished, you should know the language well. The problem is that it is very dull. The book has phonetic transcriptions of everything-something most people won't care about. I found that the transcriptions were distracting and I eventually ignored them. The dialogues are quite dull. This need to be livened up a bit."
4,"Good begginer's course! Covers fundamental's well, book poor","A ggreat beginner's course. it goes over the areas that most beginner's have troubles. The course places a major emphasis on pronunciation early on. Students should be prepared to be drilled-- over and over. I certain points the pauses seemed a bit brief so you may want to keep the pause button handy or get the CD version. Also, the book is split into two halves. Typically, the lower page is the regular language and the top is phonetic. That was confusing to me in the beginning. Also, in the beginning a lot of the drills are phonetic rather than actual spelling. Be forewarned of the potentially confusing fact and its a great course. Buena suerte!"
2,Not very useful for a beginner,"I wouldn't recommend this program for a beginner. The tapes are not very good, the people on the tapes speak so fast it's hard to learn the pronunciation of words. The study course is absolutely dull as well."
2,Not a very good course for true beginners.,"I was very disappointed with this audio cassette course. Thank goodness, I had already successfully completed a full semester of Basic Spanish at a community college. Otherwise, I would have been completely lost. The book is basically useless and the cassette tapes are not much better. There are a lot of vocabulary drills, however, the book fails to identify the translation of the majority of these words in English. I understand the drills are intended to enhance your vocabulary, but you have no idea what you're saying in Spanish. A lot of the phrases are repeated in reverse order and I clearly don't understand the purpose behind that. I also feel the grammer drills are too advanced for a true beginner and fail to provide you with the basics for real life situations."
3,An adequate option,"This study guide is ok, but not great. Because it was published in 2003, and probably written in 2002, I think that some of the information is outdated. A list of study topics are provided but not the information that goes with the topic. The practice test is ok but there were a few answers I did not agree with. (and this could be due to newer research than the book has) I would have liked a second practice test.This is the best of the not so great options. It is the most recently published, which is why I selected it, but it could use some updating. I would like to see a cd-rom added with more practice questions"
4,Great Study Tool,"This book doesn't prepare you for all of the questions on the national exam, but answering the study questions provides a comprehensive review of all topics covered on the exam. The practice test is a great way of preparing and knowing what to expect on test day."
4,SLP Praxis Study Guide,This is a handy review useful for preparing for the SLP Praxis exam. The practice test contained in this book is a good exercise for distinguishing strengths and weaknesses in prospective test takers. The test-taking advice makes good sense and I recommend this book to all graduate students in Speech and Language Pathology.
5,Everything You Need to know for a new owner!!,"This book is everything that you ever needed to know about a sugar glider! I am thinking about buying a glider and after reading this book i still do. It will be difficult, especially since it is nocturnal, but i bet anyone who tries can.This book says the nutritional needs and even a few mixes. It says EXCACTLY what you need if you're a new owner."
4,Funny Movie with a Entrepreneur that would put Wall Street to Shame,"Intermingled with a romance with a Wall Street Analylist, James Garner plays all the tricks on how to make fast money - but at the tax-man's expense.Althought this movie was made back in 1960, it has the fast pace and well thought out script to rival recent Wall Street movies. And when it comes to money making trickery - the only difference between this an recent Wall Street movies is the Taxman, and not the general population suffer from his tricks.The quality of the film is pretty good, but the flesh colours are a bit too red (making the actors less realistic), which is a shame, especially considering this is a remastered version."
5,A True Business Comedy!,This movie should be required viewing for all undergraduate business students. Garner and Remick...great.
3,"Enjoyable, Smart Comedy Starring James Garner & Lee Remick","This is a worthwhile James Garner film with a script that was written by someone who actually understands business, the stock market, and Wall Street. How many movies have you seen where the concept of what is and isn't a mutual fund is accurately discussed? Good supporting roles by Jim Backus, John Astin, and many other familiar character actors. An interesting side-note: Garner's character in this film is almost certainly the prototype for Jimmy Joe Meeker, one of Jim Rockford's many aliases in ""The Rockford Files""."
5,Wonderful family fun,"This an excellent family movie. It's very irreverent, making fun of the stock market, the SEC, modern art, New Yorkers, Texans, and Yankees, to name a few. None of the jabs are mean-spirited, and so even fans of Jackson Pollock can enjoy the character that is based (in part) on him. The jokes seem funnier over time (Henry's explanation of expressionist and impressionist painting to his group of cowboy partners is a hoot), and there is enough slapstick in the movie to keep kids entertained while you are laughing at jokes about securities fraud."
5,"Good book, good service","If you are into trains, this is a beautiful coffeetable book with great photos and interesting illustrations (maps, advertisements, brochures, menus etc.) pertaining to the Burlington Railroad's streamlined diesel-electric passsenger trains from the trailblazers of the 1930s to the Amtrak takeover in 1971.The book arrived quickly and in perfect, i.e. new, condition even though the price was about 25% of the current list price. I could not be more pleased with the entire transaction."
5,Very Enjoyable,"I really enjoy the music of certain 20th century British composers, particularly: Walton, Tavener, Holst, Delius and Vaughan Williams. I recently stumbled across Finzi and this is a beautiful album. I also recently bought Finzi's Cello Concerto also on Naxos, which is equally enjoyable. This music was considered old fashioned when it was originally recorded, but I find it charming. It's melodic and relaxing. I grew up living in the English countryside and this recording takes me back to that time."
4,An important manual for the reptile breeder.,"This manual takes the reptile owner beyond the simple task of care into the subject of why to prevent and how to treat parasites in our reptiles.The manual explains in simple terms the complexities of reptile parasites. It goes into the how-to of fecal floats, parasite identification and treatments. It takes the mystery out of the vet's back room.One of the shortest yet most useful chapters is ""Hygiene and the Herpetoculturist"". An important read for all reptile keepers and breeders."
1,Jaded and slanted,"""Simians, Cyborgs, and Women"" sounds as if it might be interesting to discuss the connections between the three conceps upon first glance. Feel free to read the opening portions of the book. They are representative of the majority of the book. If you are well-versed in fanatical feminist theories - and, more importantly, agree wholeheartedly with them - then you will enjoy the book immensely. On the other hand, if you are expecting a healthy discussion of the basis of, rationale for, and definitions of feminist theories, look elsewhere. The book is rife with shakey feminist theories which serve as premises to even still more outrageous conclusions, without any attempt to justify the premises themselves. As a result, it ends up a house of cards, without a strong foundation, puffed up far more than it ever should. I would have been more interested in seeing a well-structured analysis of the views underlying the arguments she makes. Alas, a search for such an analysis was in vain."

4,Handy Headset,"This is a good headset for Nokia phones. I have the Nokia 3120 and had a hard time finding a headset with acceptable audio quality. I like the answer/end button, you don't have to search for the phone to answer a call, and it is quite comfortable to wear."
4,Great audio quality,"Easy to use and simple design. Rubberized loop stays put and is comfortable. Very good audio quality on both ends of conversation. No volume control and chord could be just a bit longer, but on/off switch is very convenient. For the cost, great addition to my NOKIA 3587i phone."
4,"good, if you do not use glasses",Uncomfortable with glasses.But audio quality is perfect.My 1st one broke the cable internally after I used for some 6 months. The new one is not used much...
2,Answer!,It broke within 4 days. I emailed the company and it took them another 3 days to reply. I emailed them again with a question and am still waiting for a response 6 days later!
3,works well for the price,"not the greatest headset, but everyone i talk to has been able to hear me (and vice-versa) and it was definitely a great value. a little tricky getting it over my ear, but easy after i got used to it."
2,"OK headset, but breaks easily","We've gone through two of these. Got one with the phone (Nokia 3300), but broke after about 8 months of use. The replacement broke after 6 months. It's not like you have much of a choice with this type of phone, as it uses a Nokia-specific adapter, but I wish it would hold up better."
2,Nokia's proprietary connector is a bust,"The sound quality is okay, but the connector always detaches. I've gone through three of these things because the connectors break very easily. In fact, I got so frustrated with Nokia connectors that I bought an LG phone with a 3.5MM jack."
1,Bad Quality,"I ordered this item and a few weeks later it broke. if it was plugged in, you could still use speakerphone for the radio, but not the earpiece. unless you want to constantly be replacing your earpiece, i'd stick to an earbud."
1,Bad Quality,"Very bad quality of product. The little connector holder on one side got broken first day of use :-(But if it would be better quality, head set has a pretty good design & doesn't bothers the ear. Quality of sound is average."
4,Great accessory,Gave this as a gift. She used it and it seems like it worked great. She loved it but doesn't look like she uses it anymore. Probably just her.
1,Did not work,"Unfortunately, the headset did not work and I returned it for credit. The speaker did not function and the microphone gave only a garbled sound."
4,Nokia headset,"Sound quality is excellent. The only negative comment is that the cord is not as long as other headsets I have owned in the past. The cord could be about 6"" longer. Then I would give this item 5 stars."
2,Poor volume,I am very unhappy with my headset. It is extremely hard to hear the voices or for the callers to hear me with this head set. I no longer use it.
4,top-notch reggae,"His distinctive vocal style - a powerful and unusually high tenor -set him apart from the second generation of reggae singers who followed folks like Ken Boothe, John Holt and Delroy Wilson on the Jamaican scene. But it wasn't until he reappeared with Massive Attack and won over a new generation that genuine interest was triggered in his back catalogue. Great news, considering the wealth of top-notch recordings he made throughout the `70s and `80s. If you're looking for an introduction, Wicked Dem Burn will do the trick, with a `70s hit-heavy repast (Skylarking, Love of a Woman, Zion Gate, Rain From the Sky, True Love Shines Bright) of quavery, groove-based dub/reggae all voiced with Andy's impeccable phrasing. Good old-fashioned reggae."
4,A Good Start,"Florence Rush has done an excellent job in delineating the problem of the sexual abuse of children. If this book does nothing else, it may alert people, parents in particular, to the extent of the problem, the denial that often accompanies it, and certain strategies of defence. On the minus side, Rush seems to assume that nearly all the sexual abuse that occurs is perpetrated on females, and while she does devote one chapter to the sexual abuse of males, she seems to regard this as the exception rather than the rule (I find this odd, consodering that mosr abusers seem to be male, and sexual predators have been found almost invariably to have been victims of similar crimes themselves). Also was a rather pointless excerpt about why Lewis Carroll was not a child molester, but merely a bloke who liked little girls (? ). Anyway, the book is an excellent resource for everybody despite it's shortcomings, and should be read by all people, but parents in particular."
3,Opinion of an old fan!,"I remember Billy's terrific voice from years past and he still sounds great, but I didn't care for the ""live nightclub banter."" It would have been been more nostalgic and romantic with just his wonderful singing with the musicians. His ""Old Black Magic"" makes the CD worth buying."
4,Still a great game,"I just bought this game last week off of amazon.com. I've always played PS2 and PS console NASCAR games and I wanted to get something that would run on my crappy computer. Of course, NASCAR Legends works perfectly fine since it's from 1999. While the graphics are crappy today, the sound is great and the racing is alot of fun. Any NASCAR fan that wants to have fun needs to get this. I use my ""PS2"" syle PC controller for this game bc I can't afford a steering wheel."
2,Steam Trains: An American Portrait,The title is somewhat misleading. These are American trains in foreign lands. Many have been modified for use in the third world and have only some resemblance to what left the foundry.
1,Shameless,"This is shameless. everything here is available somewhere else. This is the kind of CD that radio stations buy. Just meaningless radio singles. There are some good bands on here but you should get their releases, not this. blink 182 , Sum 41, and Alien ant farm don't qualify as nu metal."
5,Borrowed one...then bought two!,"I borrowed this book from the public library. After spending time with it I ended up ordering a copy for my home library and another for the collection of the library where I work. Now I think I may have to buy one for my sister. If you like Mediterranean food, Mediterranean history, or both, this book is a bargain. Buy one while it is still in print."
1,A Mediterranean Feast,"A pretentious and extremely poorly organized book which purports to be both history and a cook book. The history sections are, in many instances, superficial and/or pure speculation and the recipes are mostly regurgitations of recipes in other (and better cook books). The recipes that are not regurgitations are rather arcane and, in my view, there is good reason for them to remain that way. Thus there is a recipe which calls for lima beans in a micro-wavable package. As to organization, at pp 32-33 there is a recipe for pasta with tomato sauce which precedes a section entitled Money and Capitalism. It is impossible to find any rational organization that is remotely useful to a cook. An article on artichokes explains that they are labor intensive to prepare, but like lobster worth the effort. There are simply too many good cook books oj the market to buy this overpriced one. Either get a history book or a cook book because this is neither."
5,Definitely a Feast!!!!,"If you like history and you like Mediteranean food, you will love this book! Very fascinating stuff...."
1,A Mediterranean Feast by Clifford A Wright,I have many criticsms of this book including structure and layout but by far the worst is that the recipes are often no good.The times given to cook meat/fish are way-way too long.I have rarely encountered a book so disappointing.
1,The book is not as how it is described for recipes,The book is billed as a #1 book for vegetarians. It has tons of recipes that hare meat based. Too much back story and not enough meatless recipes
2,Extremely Biased...,"I found this book exciting and interesting as far as the history of true Mediterranean Cuisine, but some of the statements of the author are quite opinionated, bold and brash (and couldn't necessarily be substantiated) and some extremely biased against Christianity. He is an Arab-studies scholar before this, and so it seems he finds time and again places where he can make digs on Christians of the past. I had a hard time getting past his little remarks to get to the real meat of his history.As far as the recipes...they are a bit disappointing. Like the other reviewer, they are scattered throughout the book, seemingly without organization. While trying to write about true historical Mediterranean cuisine, he throws in modern recipes from friends at various spots....almost like an afterthought. There isn't much rhyme or reason to where or why recipes are in a certain section or chapter.And it is very longwinded..."
1,Unrealistic,"This book annoyed me slightly because the girl is a complainer. I don't know if I just maybe didn't get the humor, was it supposed to be funny? I just thought it impractical that she was so insane about getting engaged after only dating 9 months!"
4,Fun Summer Read,I was glad to find some good lighthearted but not insipid chick-lit fiction for twenty-somethings in the Christian fiction section! She's Out of Control combines pop-culture with very real concerns facing single women who are struggling to figure out what in the world they're doing! The characters are fun and too true-to-life! Now that I've read She's Out of Control I want to go back and read the previous book 'What a Girl Wants'!
1,Unreadable Christian Chick Lit,"Let me preface by saying I bought this book cheap in a bookstore. I am a fan of ""chick lit"" and this seemed to fit the bill. I had no idea from the cover or liner notes that this book was going to mention God and Christianity in every paragraph, along with the implication that if you're not ""in"" on both, you're just a bad person.Don't get me wrong... I have no issue with Christians, but I do have issues with self-obsessed, self-righteous characters thinking God has absolutely nothing better to do than answer their inane prayers about nothing. There is no message in this book apart from God seems to sit around all day, letting the third world starve, while He grants the wishes of girls pining over boys. Ridiculous. Badly written, whiny and plain stupid. Some Christians need to re-prioritize, and this author definitely needs to have a good think about what life is really all about."
3,One Sitting Reading,"Good book, indeed. I read it in a few hours. Well-written, with the exception of a few fact problems. For example, the book was published in 2004 but mentions Comdex (formerly world's largest computer tradeshow). This is a problem, at least for me, because Comdex ceased operations in 2002. It kind of makes me second guess anything else. But, beyond that, it's a good read. One thing I liked is that the characters are real. They act like we would act. Unless you are a near-righteous Christian living the perfect Christian life, you know that when disaster strikes (whether minor or serious), you probably don't immediately go to prayer. You might shop like Ashley, rely on caffeine or food, or some other wordly crutch before you realize only God can truly pull you through. So, I applaud Billerbeck for making her characters real."
2,she's THAT girl,"I recently discovered Christian chick-lit. I was psyched to find fiction that was witty, funny, and contemporary; however, when I encountered this book, I was severely disappointed.Ashley is THAT girl - the one so obsessed with finding Mr. Right that she doesn't know which way is up. I've met plenty of them throughout my life and they're generally the girls I try to avoid. All I wanted to do was smack Ashley and scream ""Grow up!"" She's immature and shallow and definitely someone I would never want to meet. If we were at a party, she would be the girl I tried to avoid at all costs. And it's incredibly draining to read a book about a person like that.Overall, there's nothing unique or surprising about this book. It's just another girl freaking out about being single and hunting men like they're rabbits. To be honest, I think it does a disservice to women who recognize that there's more to life. As a woman, I'm disappointed."
2,Waste...,"I commented on the first book of this series. I hoped this one might be better, but, alas, I am still disappointed with this author."
5,A knock out read,"Buy it. Read it. Laugh out loud. It is soooo well written and funny and entertaining. And best yet, it's ""today"" and shows that we Christian sisters are definitely not little church ladies.Eva Shaw, Ph.D.Director, Women's MinistriesLas Flores Church of the Nazarene"
4,Culturally sound,"I was intrested in the cultural aspect especially with the Hispanic workers. However, I found the Spanish phrases that this book has for employers to use, inconsistent. In Spanish you have the formal YOU and the informal YOU. Sometimes the book would use the formal and then the informal without explaining why they did this. In Spanish it is best to err on the side of caution and use the formal YOU at all times. It's not only more professional to use, but it shows respect for the people you are addressing."
2,Misleading translations,"The translations in this book are literal, not by context and can misleadp. 218. . . we don't have any openings.comes across in Spanish as ""we don't have any cracks.""and in Chinese as ""we don't have any holes.""p. 215Also, the term ""flyer"" as in an advertising flyer comes across in both Chinese and Spanish as something similar to an airplane pilot.There are many other examples, but these are the most glaring.Also much of the Spanish is Spanglish or Americanized Spanish of words that people in Spanish speaking countries do not use. And for many of the Chinese vocabulary words, the book states ""no translation."" That is true there may be no direct or literal translation, but there are always similar words.I was disappointed in this reference book."
5,A smashing success,"I remember when the song ""Come Out and Play"" came out. The song was just so catchy; I just had to have the album...then I saw the cover and thought it might be really ugly music -- hardcore noise. But I bought it anyway.Boy, was I wrong for judging the album by its cover! ""Smash"" is fun from start to finish, and has a frolicking sound that's a little less mainstream-friendly than those of the albums that followed ""Smash"".It's a classic that you can listen to over and over without ever growing tired of it. I think it's one of the greatest albums of the 90s."
5,This is the most radical CD ever recorded!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought all Offspring CD's ,and I'm sure no one is like ""SMASH"" even the latest one ÄMERICANA"" .I love all the songs but in my opinion the coolest ones are ""SELF STEEM"",""GOT GET AWAY""and of course ""KEEP'N SEPARATED""."
5,At their prime,"I think their first two albums were mainly to get a feel for themselves, make a sound, and get used to the rock scene. Smash was their major breakthrough; nearly all the tracks are good, including the hidden one, basically a remix of the riff from Come Out and Play (Keep 'em Seperated). Most of the tracks are really good, but the real cream of the crop's in the beginning, with Nitro, Bad Habit, Gotta Get Away, Genocide, Something to Believe In, Come Out and Play (Keep 'em Seperated) and Self Esteem. The second half kind of sways down a little bit. Killboy Powerhead was mediocre at best. If I could have, I would have given this 4 1/2 stars, but they didn't have it so I just rounded up... all in all, an awesome CD."
4,Glad I bought it,"Never really listened to these guys before, saw them play at the Social Distortion benefit concert at Irvine Meadows (went mainly to see X, THE greatest band, period). Anyways, the Offspring put on a real good show, so I eventually ended up buying this CD, which was a smart move because this CD is EXTREMELY good. Great energy and lyrics, every song is worth listening to. 5 stars are reserved for perfect CDs (e.g. Los Angeles/Wild Gift by X, Axis: Bold as Love by Hendrix), but this CD is better than 99% of the stuff out there."
4,My fave Offspring C.D.,"I really do think that this is the band's best album. This is what made them my favorite band until I heard GREEN DAY(dookie). The 2 best songs are COME OUT AND PLAY & SELF-ESTEEM. I wish they would of done more with this album. It never really got that far, like AMERICANA did. Go out and buy it now."
5,What happened?,"I'm not usually compelled to write reviews, even for other albums that I think deserve a 5 STAR rating. However, ""Smash"" is one of the greatest albums from the 90's. Their later material makes me vomit and just depresses me to think that it's the same Offspring. Dexter was a voice for grunge kids in the early 90's, now he's a horrible parody of his former self. The entire band went down hill and will never reach the status of this album, again.This a classic album and I hope to God it's never forgotten."
1,Worst album of all time!,"Okay, that is not an exaggeration. There is absolutely NOTHING worthwhile about this CD. The songs are all of that phony ""we're so tough because we're 12 years old and have a browring"" mentality, and all sound identical. What's even more offensive is how this was supposed to be life-changing ""punk rock"" or something. If you're a 10-year-old kid in 1994 who wants be ""kewl"" then pick this up, otherwise give it a miss."
2,FOurteen identical songs,"Ok, this is Offspring's best. But the trouble with releasing an album with 14 songs is that, unevitably, by the middle of the album the band generally is running out of steem. This is the case with SMASH. After being pleasantly surprised by the beginning, the listener wil rapidly get bored with the huge quantity of songs using the chorus ""OOOOOOOOOOO""..."
3,Sold Rock Fun,"If you know the offspring at all, you know what to expect from this album. If you don't, here it is: above average rock hymns worth humming to yourself to psyche yourself up with. ""Come Out and Play"" and ""Self Esteem"" are probably the two best songs the Offrspring have ever produced. Overall this album will not revolutionize your music library, but it will add some fun solid rock music worth listening to with the music cracked up. I don't think this album could disappoint you too much unless you're really expecting far too much from this band, but it might just entertain you a bit more than you'd expect. Relax, sit back, don't over think this effort and just enjoy the noise."
5,outstanding,"i love this cd, its not raw offspring but its still great and u simply must own it so meny great songs and it contains the hits self esteem and some out and play. If you are a fan of offspring u simply must say this is the ebst cd they have ever done and ever will do catchy, great lyrics and great guitar and drums gete it now fool u re missin out on aa great cd!Stand out tracks: nitro (youth energy), bad habbit, smash, self esteem"
3,A very mediocre disc,"Too much of the straight three cord, traditional punk beat average punk lyrics on this cd for me. I'm a big fan of the loud rock, emo, and some hardcore and that but, punk is a quite drab background and these guys do nothing to make it any better."
3,its ok,"this cd is not a favorite of mine. the offspring have always been able to draw the metal listeners (bands like Korn, i dont listen to it), and still keep the punk rock crowd interested. I don't like this cd much though, mainly because they're songs are boring and uninspired, but thats just me... i like ""what happened to you?"" a bit. for all you korn fans, i'd suggest you listen to ""i fell asleep on my arm"" by the Aquabats off their new b-side cd.. and that includes all you ratm and limp bizkit people too."
2,TOO MAINSTREAM,Why?? well they overplayed the dam videos to come out and play and self esteem on Mtv therefore this was in fact the beginning of the end of the band in my case. the cd has 9 cool songs thats about it. the earlier work offspring S/T and Ignition were their best work go for those instead.
3,"Mundane, but Good","Short and sweet, this album contains a lot of good songs. My only complaint: they are all very similar. The repeating power chords in the same basic format for each song gets a little tiresome. Don't get me wrong, I like the style, but when buying this album, I felt like I paid (...)the dollars for one or two songs.The basic song format (Opening riff, then Chorus, then interlude, then Chorus, then Closer) has worked very well for the Offspring up to this point, but it does get a little mundane.My advice:1. Download a couple songs from an FTP site instead of buying the whole CD2. Try buying some of Offspring's earlier works. You can't go wrong with ""Americana"""
3,Smash hits,"3 1/2Though its power-chorded repetitions can wear thin, one must admit that this marks another peak for punk-pop which only may fall second to Green Day's Dookie."
5,SMASH HIT,"Being a music expert I must say "" Smash "" is fantastic with music that will keep you listening until it's time to go back school or work or the unemployment office. Listening to this SMASH HIT I've changed my additude to punk rock.Buy this CD! !"
5,THE OFFSPRINGS FINEST...,"this, along with 'ignition' is definitely the offsprings best. its the perfect hard/punk/rock/whatever album."
5,AWESOME,"this is definately the best cd i have ever heard. DEFINATELY the best punk cd, and best rock cd and best alt. cd. ITS THE BEST... CD YOU'LL EVER GET, SO GO OUT AND FRIGGIN BUY IT"
5,Legendary punk.,"This disc is AWESOME. The offspring at their best. Every single song is great. For those of you who dont think the Offspring classify as 'punk' listen to Smash or It'll Be A Long Time. I listen to this album almost every day, it always makes me really angry...pure energy. Get it, you will not be sorry."
4,SMASH is the smashing hit of offspring,SMASH has a unique sound to it that makes you want to boogy on down to the nearest music store to buy it. Dexter's voice just makes you want to be just like him. All these songs feel like a real life situation in which Dexter sings he whole life away.
5,"A 5 star effort, for many reasons.","This CD is punkrock at its best. It will make you smile with its humor, and appreciate its great guitar from ""noodles"" and greg k,fast a-- drums from (I forget his name, but he's good), and of course, Dexter Holland's passionate vocals. I think lists are boring, so listen to the samples to find out about the songs. Basically, this CD roocks, and is a departure from the pop influences in Americana and Conspiricy of One."
4,"Solid skate punk,but","anyone notice that ""Gotta Get Away""'s verse parts are sung in the same way as Nirvana's ""About a Girl"" verse parts? I heard it on the radio today, and I wanted to sing ""About a girl"" but of course, Offspring's lyrics were different."
5,The Best of Offspring,"***** This is, without a doubt, Offspring's best CD. This was Offspring in their prime when they really ROCKED! I've had this CD for 5 years and I still listen to it all the time. Don't be dissapointed by Americana, get Smash and treat yourself with some real ROCK! *****"
5,Smash,"After getting Americana first I went and got Smash.I listened to it all the way threw and took a five minute breake and listened to it again. I couldn't decide which was better this or Americana so I like them the same.I recomend them both. The best songs on it are Bad Habit,Gotta Get Away,Come Out and Play,Self Esteem,and What Happened To You. The only song I don't like is So Alone it is short,rushed,and stupid.Other than that this cd is awsome."
4,a good cd,I wouldnt give this cd 5 stars. Beacause i dont like some of the songs on the cd.the best tracks are ''come out and play'' and ''smash''.I think the offspring definitly improved on americana.I would reccomend both cds to anyone who likes alternative.
5,My all-time favorite favorite CD,One of the few albums I own where I really like every single song on the CD. Well worth the $15-20 you'd pay for it.
5,This is best CD. Makes Korn Look like N' Sync,"I got this CD a year ago when I heard Come out and Play and Bad Habit. I still cna't get enough of this Album. Every song is good. It's great at parties, just play this whole CD, and it's perfect."
5,Smash: Must-have CD for the true punk rocker!,"The Orange-County-based punk rock band 'Offspring' has done it again. Their CD ""Smash"" is just bursting with 13 great songs and a hilarious intro. With such tracks as 'Come Out and Play' and 'Bad Habit', most people can head-bang and mosh to their heart's content. Not much of an extreme hard rocker? No biggie! With tunes like 'What Happened to You' and 'It'll Be a Long Time', you can enjoy this punk rock CD in a more peaceful manner. As it seems most CDs wear out after listening to them for some time, I have always been able to listen to ""Smash"" repeatedly. It is a must-have CD for the true punk rocker!"
5,This CD had everything from energetic punk to arabian riffs.,"This CD has the energetic punk in songs like Gotta Get Away, to the Arabian Riffs in Come Out and Play. Dexter Holland expresses true feeling in his songs, which he all wrote, except for the damneds Smash It Up."
4,Solid,"Smash is one of the albums where you can put it in your CD player, occupy yourself with something else, and listen to the whole CD several times through. There is not a sub-par song on the album. There are several outstanding songs (Self-Esteem, Nitro, Gotta Get Away) which would be good for even the casual Offspring listener. Great for the rock enthusiast, and catchy enough for the casual rock listener."
1,War of the World Complete Series Defective Discs,"I recently ordered the War of The World Complete Series and found Disc 3 on ""The Final Season"" does not work. I returned the set and requested a replacement. The second set has the identical problem on the same disc. I gave up, returned it again and asked for a refund. Watch out there might be a batch problem with these DVDs."
4,A trip down memory lane,"First of let me say to Paramount it's about time! I still had some of these on VHS tape but once I started watching these in order I realized I had only seen about half of the episodes that had actually aired. WOTW was one of many first-run syndicated programs that was on in 1989 and 1990 mostly shown at odd hours. The second season took a drastic turn from the first season that you either like or you hate. I found the intensity and the pace to be quite hectic at times and literally would be on the edge of the couch so to speak.What's great today watching these is seeing the old computers, the BIG car phone, and the clothes and haircuts of the time! What is more prominent in the second season is the battle between the aliens and the Humans, and there are many close shaves and our heroes wind up in several tight spots that they always seem to just get out of. The last episode does wrap things up nicely albeit a pity I would have enjoyed a third season."
1,Such a waste,"I just loved the cat-and-mouse game played in the first season. The aliens thought their revival had gone undetected and despite the lost of much of their burning-ray technology, their need to take over human hosts, and their limited numbers hid out in a radioactive cave in the desert they felt confident. The humans, on the other hand, were largely clueless of the enemy they faced. Their single advantage was that the aliens didn't know that they knew. The motley crew of of defenders combined in such a way to cover each other deficiencies and enhance their talents. The alien enemy took over various humans in sets of threes from college students to fashion executives, providing a strange commentary of contempary society. Each episode brought out new revelations about the alien enemy.They threw that all away with the second season, going for glitz and battles. Such a waste."
2,"Cool series, but bad ""the complete series collection""","Great set, except... I thought this was gonna be a nice complete edition boxed set, or something similar. Instead it is just season one (nicely slipcased) and season two (plain dvd case) bound together with plastic wrap. Not so cool in my opinion. They should have made the extra effort to make a nice (fold out?)box. This way it only looks cheap. But for the contents, great to be able to watch the entire series."
1,Not War of the Worlds at all,"Not a patch on Series 1,a completely different programme.Everything good about the series was dropped,the best character killed off.War of the Worlds was just Series 1.Avoid this dross at all costs"
3,mixed feelings,"I have to agree with the other review concerning the amount of unnecessary violoence portrayed in this special. On the other hand, the content relating to breeding and the issues resulting from it is very well stated and useful for my biology class.It is very dificult to find more interesting videos that contain a specific content for use in my biology class. I often have to show something that only ""generally"" covers a topic. This video fits my needs for the ""biotechnology"" unit well.However, I am still not comfortable about the amount of violoence. Sadly, my students were not in the least bothered with it. Does that make me too sensitive? Does it point to their lack of sensitivity? I don't know.4 stars for content, 2 stars for taste."
5,great style,This product from Hue is another success. It gives legs an energizing comfort and stays put during a long day at work.
4,Best for longer hikes,"My three teenagers and I took this book with us on a recent trip to Yellowstone. It was helpful and we did do one of the hikes specifically because we found it in the book, but we were looking more for short hikes and this seemed to have more of the longer hikes. If you're looking to spend all day hiking a trail in and back, or going to be camping in the backcountry, this is the book for you!"
3,A WORD OF CAUTION !!!,"All the good reviews for this dvd are right; great music and a superb performance. BUT.....the audio is so low I wasn't able to get a loud volume through a pair of Klipch towers + a 250w. JBL sub + a 65w per channel Denon amp. The Klipshs have an efficiency of 105.5 w/m . I demuxed the audio, ran it through a program that boosts it, remuxed it and record the final result onto a dvd-r. So my original is just decorative now. It's incredible in this day and age that a Black Metal dvd has such a flaw. Who would want to play this at such a low volume ?!. Word of advice ? Get the Live Wacken newer one instead; that one is a killer !!"
3,"Great Performance, Bad Sound...","As other reviews have noted the performance and video production are near flawless, but the sound is a problem for me. The original release of the DVD in 2000 featured a mono sound mix that was so lo-fi that it was almost non-existent. This 2004 version corrects the volume problem, but the mix is still mono. On a 5.1 system audio only comes out of the center speaker. This is not something I expect from a 21st century release. Is a 5.1 mix or at least a stereo mix too much to ask for in the DVD age? I mean, I know this is black metal, but this was a point in Emperor's career that they actually had financial backing behind them, and even their earliest albums were in stereo. They were touring in support of IX Equilibrium not Wrath of the Tyrant after all. Anyway, still a great DVD to own, but gets 3 stars due to the sound."
3,wood stream rabbit water bottle review,"This bottle will crack after the second year of having been outside in cold winters. Other than that, it's good. I'd expected it to have lasted longer than two winters here in Texas though."
1,Not at all what I thought. . .,"I had used the previous version of this software without a hitch. This ""updated"" version is terrible. It was so much easier to set limits, sdd dimensions even print. Now you need to know the basics of CAD to operate this. If I knew CAD I would be using it."
1,Impossible for the ordinary person to use,"I have used several previous versions of this software with a fair amount of success, but Broderbund has now made it nearly impossible. There is no advantage to upgrading to version 5.0. Virtually all of the user friendly functions such as automatically inserting dimension lines are gone. Don't bother. If you could use this successfully, you wouldn't need it. You'd know real CAD. In a nutshell, I hate the new version."
4,Good Ford Replacement Mirrors,"I ordered both the drivers side and passenger side mirrors for my 1987 Ford Ranger. After receiving and inspecting the mirrors I noticed they are more cheaply made than I thought they would be. They just seem cheap and I had to send back the passenger side mirror to Amazon because the mounting bracket was completely detached from the mirror and the way they are made you cannot re-attach it due the the nut being stuck inside of the mirror. Amazon's customer service was very understanding of the issue and sent me a replacement mirror and paid for 2 day shipping. Other than that they work good as mirrors. A note to buyers though, be careful how much you loosen the screw to adjust the mirror because the more you loosen it the harder it gets to re-tighten the screw."
5,Does what it needs to,I used 1 package to directly apply address labels on two black solar group mailboxes. Plenty of letters were included. Also included was one address label standy thing; looked sturdy but it was not how I was going to use it.
5,good product,"This is a good product. The service and price was right and delivered right to your door can't be beat. These filters fit a fairly old humidifier and are not available in stores in my area, so that is why I searched to see if they were still available. I found them here and am very satisfied with them. I would definately recommend them to any one that needs them and certainly will be buying mere as i need them. Delivery right to your door and no shopping around in stores is also a big plus."
1,Defective workmanship,"This toy is defective. The screws that hold it together will not seat, therfore the front roller falls off. We want to return this for credit."
1,Really bad delivery service,"I really like the magazine - it's exactly what I was looking for, but I've had a lot of problems with them delivering the magazine to me. I'm constantly missing issues. Just a warning if you want to order it."
4,Think before you buy,"From the previous reviews, it appears that a few people have bought this book without thinking about what the contents are. Only buy this book if you are documenting Microsoft style software. What you have here is a glossary of terms, not a manual about grammar usage. While you may not be happy using terms because Microsoft says so, these terms have become accepted by software users. If you do write software documentation this book is invaluable."
1,"Some basics, but not a whole lot to use","I purchased this book a few years ago, and I was disappointed for the most part. It does give a little insight into some pressure points, but not much real application or specific angles at which the pressure points should be struck. If you want some suggestions on some very excellent videos and books on very useful self-defense with pressure points, email me at toelio@aol.com"
1,"Many pictures, poor info","I am studying martial art and this book did not teach me anything new. I did not said how to apply them or how to find them properly. If I will be just standing there and pressing the point, the guy can simply punch my in a nose or eye and he did not had to spend money and time learning the ""special pressure point"". So save your money and time!"
3,Introduction to the Dillman System of PP fighting techniques,"An interesting presentation of martial arts techniques, intended for incorporation into varying martial arts systems."
2,Publicity stuntman... Go flashy GI go..,Lots of cheesy publicity photo's in front of book. Not very responsible when it comes to demonstrating revival points.
2,Interesting But Inaccurate,"As a kung-fu practitioner and acupuncturist, I found a good deal of the information contained in this text to be inaccurate. The effects of striking some of the points shown in the book are incorrect and in any event, real combat happens much too fast to try to strike a number of the (minor) points suggested by Mr. Dillman.Moreover, many (acupuncture) points must be struck with various type(s) of power in order to be effective. You cannot simply give them a solid whack and expect much. Knowing where the points are located is only part of the equation. You have to develop, through special training, the type(s) of force needed to adversely stimulate these points.It's a cute book, but falls short of the mark."
2,New Version Not So Sweet,"First, the picture provided by Amazon is not what will arrive at your door. Once you get past the fact that the pump arrives from Amazon in a bike box (yes a bike box) you will see that the latest version does not have wooden handles, the guage is located at the top of the barrel, and the pump essentially no longer has a classical design. And second, the connector is very difficlut to use. Either Pedro's overthought the design or I just did not understand how to use it, but without instructions, I had difficulty getting it to work properly and simply went back to my older more simpler floor pump. Again, this could be a issue with me and not the product."
4,"For all the Freaks, don't be Separated Out","A new live album in the shops! Marillion are a band that like to entertain and with this album they do that. From the opening sample of ""Separated Out"" to the closing note of ""Easter"" Marillion are giving us a great show. Included are a nice collection of songs from the last studio album. Some of these songs, I now prefer over their studio incarnation. The energy trasferred by the audience augments the vibe, particularly on ""Quartz.""Sorry to dissappoint anybody expecting ""Kayleigh,"" ""Lavendar,"" or any songs of the Fish era. This collection is all h. And h gives his all, IMO.I have this retail version as well as the double disc version available only from Marillion themselves. For the causual listener, this collection will serve you well. For the true die-hard, you should already have your double disc version on the way.Recommmended listening strategy for this I'm gonna swipe from the ""Brave"" liner notes. Play it LOUD with the lights off."
2,Butterfly Meadow Salad Plate,This plate appears to be a second as is sometimes sold in outlet stores. The colors are very faded. I will not purchase again from this supplier if I have a choice.
2,Playing with Penny,"Most of the ""Moonlight"" movies I buy are 4 to 5 stars, but this one, and mostly because of Nicole Oring, SUCKED!! She has a great ""BODY,"" but she should learn that it's OK to have sex with a man, once in awhile!! To me, ""Playing with PENNY"" isn't worth ""TWO CENTS!!"""
1,Phil's review,I could not get this program to run on my computer. I have a Dell 4550 with 1 gig of ram and a nvida 6800 graphics card with 128meg ram So I cannot rate this program. Wasted Money
3,Review of India Discovered by John Keay,This is a very good book that gives a great account of how the history of India was uncovered beginning in the 18th century. The discovery of the past reads much like a detective novel.
5,Stunning!,"Kevin Brownlow has assembled a wonderful gallery of Pickford images surrounding all aspects of her professional life... including a great gag shot of America's Sweetheart dressed as her husband, swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks, and ""slaying"" her film crew. A delightful look at the triumphs of the first bona-fide movie star in cinematic history."
1,Disappointingly!,"This story is too simple. I didn't see that I want to see.In a word, a man grows sandkings but maltreat them. And the end he came home to roost.Disappointingly!"
4,good grief.................................!,"I'm so embarrassed - this is fun!I got it on a whim, it didn't seem as complicated as a lot of games, but it does take a lot of skill to anticipate when and where to shoot. Good sound effects."
1,...,please dont play this game. its so cruel... shooting cows? jeez as if butchering them wasn't bad enough.
3,"Great album, could be better","This really is an awesome album, and has some of their best songs ever, like ""Bright Green Globe."" The downside is the annoying, non-melodic voice on many of the tracks, like the voice in ""Flower Tattoo."" That doesn't sound like Smalley singing, and he really brings down the music quality. I liked 'Blue' and 'Last of the Sharpshooters' better."
5,IF YOU COULD ONLY HAVE 5CD'S MAKE THIS ONE OF 'EM,"This is quite truly one of my favorite albums. The only reason I bought it was someone else made me listen to it. There other stuff might be poor, but they got there act together for this one."
5,you are the best!,iam just crazy about u guys n ur songs.the songs are really very beautiful coz they touch my heart.for the first time when i heard unbreakable i felt likeit was my own story.its true that when ever iam upset i listen to those songs but my cassatte has got spoilt iam really really sad about it.i want to buy a new one but her in hyderabad where i live this album is not available.i request the bmg company to plesse open a store here in hyderabd.i think you lads have very good lovely heart n nobody can replace you in my heart.iam relly sad that bryan has left westlife i want him to come back.
4,Very good!!,"I really liked this piece. The detail on the dragon is really good, and it is slightly heavy so you would need to put in a thicker chain. The only thing I found off about it was that the glass sphere was darker than expected against skin. It only looks the red in the photo when light shines through it. Anywhere else it is almost black with a slight red tint. Other than that I love it. Got lots of notice wearing it."
4,comfortable camp chair.,"Love it, you can leave it on and change your sleep pad into a lounger in seconds"
1,A manual substitute,"Being an avid Premiere user, I was eagerly waiting for its release. I bought this book here at Amazon as an used book. I was wondering why that user sold it off almost immediately when this book was released - a book which was as good as new with CD unopened. I knew the answer only when I received the package. It is nothing but a duplicate of the manual with little elaboration. It is good for only for those who don't own the legal copy of Premiere 6 and want a manual. For the rest don't bother with this book. The CD which I still haven't bothered to open it, contain nothing of significance - just some sample footage and trial versions of Adobe software (which comes with the original Adobe CD anyway or could be downloaded for free)."
1,"Same Adobe manual, different cover","Agree with the other reviewer...this is simply the Premiere 6 Adobe user's manual with the bible cover. The only real diference is that they use more pictures (screenshots) to illustrate. I read the Adobe manual, and it was fairly useless. I looked at this book for about 30 minutes at the university bookstore and it literally followed the same sequence as the manual. Clearly, not worth $40+ as there are better books available."
2,Confusing Mishmash,"This book appears to have a lot of helpful information in it, but there are a lot of gaps. It takes a subject and touches the tip of every iceberg, but leaves way too much information out and assumes way too much knowledge on the user's part. The photos of the projects are horrid; just barely ledgible and convey no real information about what each step is trying to accomplish. The section on superimpostion is a hash of jargon and half formed concepts. Useful if you can get it cheap, but otherwise save your dough."
2,Confusing and Shallow,"I usually like the Bible series - but this one is not only confusingly laid out, the treatment of the subject is at best novice. It seemed the authors wrote out of the Manual instead of actually working out the details for themselves by using the software. If can be avoided, then don't buy it."
4,Gets the Job Done,"I have to disagree with some of the other users. I found that this book covered every aspect of Premiere and definitely added some valuable context beyond the basic ""how to"" found in the manual. It was comprehensive, filled with helpful tips and notes, and included lots of additional leads and info for Web-based resources and hardware / studio setups."
5,Better than the new stuff,"This was the first Rancid cd I ever owned way back in like 95, and it is still by far my favorite cd. Unfortunately it got stolen out of my car last year and ever since then I've been going crazy. If you've only heard new Rancid DEFINITELY pick this one up cause you'll love it guaranteed! And if you've heard Time Bomb and Ruby Soho and you think that's what Rancid usually sounds like think again, this here is classic Rancid."
4,Let's Go...To The Pit!!,"A great release by East-Bay's finest.Now with vocals Lars Federicksen on their side,Rancid rocks even harder than their first album.Great and catchy songs like Nihilism,Radio,Sidekick and 7 Years Down.This album has no ska,all punk rock tunes but I still enjoy the album.If you're a punk,this one is a MUST in your collection."
4,"fast, furious and catchy","As one of punk rocks greatest bands of our generation, this is their first great album. we are introduced to new co-frontman Lars Frederikssen who now adds a whole new dynamic to their sound. the songs on this album are all quick paced, to the point and very catchy with rancids trademark trade off vocals between tim and lars, and with plenty of ""heys"" and ""hos"". bassist matt freeman still contributes some vocals which is to some detriment to the record but not enough to really negatively impact the albums overall quality. outstanding tracks are ""Nihilism"", ""Radio"" and the absolutely incredible ""Harry Bridges"". this is a must have for any punk rock fan."
5,deffinately the best RANCID record,"This is the best cd in my collection. I still listen to this cd all the time, even after i have had it for 2 years. If you like Rancid or want to hear them for the first time, deffinately buy this classic cd."
5,Rancid aren't sell-outs you snotty nosed punk wannabes,"Here's the thing: Rancid paid their dues, unlike you who have mommy and daddy buy your Sex Pistols records at the local mall. They have good tunes, that's all that matters, oh well, next year you'll be back to listening to Matchbox 20 anyway. Oh yeah, I was once told the Clash were ""sell-outs"" too, so were the Jam...ha ha ha.. you tossers."
5,LET'SS GOOOO!!!!,"I really enjoy this second bomb by RANCID!All the songs got that punk RANCID style, with classics like NIILISM, RADIO, SIDEKICK, TENDERLOIN, I'M THE ONE...WOW! All the songs are good! I highly recommend RANCID to everyone that enjoys punk hardcore!!!"
2,Am I missing something.........?,"I loved Operation Ivy immensly so I was so disappointed by how lame Rancid is. This album is pretty lame and its one of their best. After hearing Tim sing on this album I realized why they needed Jesse as lead singer in Op Iv. Now Tim is in that horrible ""Transplant"" band with the lame Blink 182 guy. Not to mention he's friends with that loser from GOOD CHARLOTTE!!! And the new Rancid music is sooooooo poesur. Ugggggghhhh. Although some of these songs are catchy they are all non-political and non-offensive. A lame excuse for punk rock, I probably would have liked Rancid back when I used to listen to Green Day."
1,Am I missing something?,"This CD is terrible. I hate the vocals. They sound terrible. Really, really stupid lyrics. These guys are Clash wannabees and I do not even like The Clash! These guys need to quit. I am amazed people like this garbage.This music seems to pre-planned not spontaneous enough to be Punk. This type of music was boring when the Clash did it back in the Seventies, why rehash it now?"
4,Im Going,Great CD some of Rancid's bestyou see this is punk ROCKnot that wimpy punk like simple plangood beats with some awesome guitarsand an occasionaly killer guitar solooh and the bass player is great(but not quite as good as in ...And Out Come The Wolves)awesome bass linesThe singer's voice matches perfectly to the musicThe Songs are short but sweetand 20 of emonly thing i dont like is how the songs endthey just kinda drop offover all 4/5 stars
2,Not worth it,I thought it was going to be him talking but It was just like attending his church. Not worth the money. I probibly could have just watched it on YouTube.
4,A great outing in a great series,"In this outing in the Arkady Renko series of Russian mysteries, Detective Renko is called on to investigate the suicide of a Russian tycoon. Unraveling the mystery leads him to the ghostly outlaw city of Chernobyl.I just love this series. The phelgmatic Renko appears to be one of life's losers, but he still pursues his cases with a relentless passion for justice and a dry, mordant sense of humor that makes his character a joy to follow. The details about Russian life are alternately unsparing, horrifying, and hilarious. The plot of the story, which came to involve the Chernobyl accident, Jewish history, and Renko's own past as a survivor of suicide, was compelling and first-rate.On the downside, the story did seem to wind up hurriedly, and at times I found myself having to backtrack to refresh my memory about different parts of the plot. Nonetheless, this was another great outing in a great series. Start with Gorky Park and go from there if you have not."
3,Entertaining,"Bought the audio book to help with a long drive & was not disappointed. The story kept my interest; fascinated with people living in ""Black Zones"" of Chernobyl & how they eke out a day to day existence. Liked it."
4,"His best since ""Gorky Park""","I just finished ""Wolves"" last night, and reread the last two chapters this morning to make sure I hadn't missed anything. This was a delightful book: in my opinion, Mr. Smith's best Renko novel since ""Gorky Park."" Nice tight plot. Good character development. And, the wonderfully beleaguered, intelligent and painfully human sensibility of Arkady Renko. A great character. So believable that you thoroughly enjoy following his exploits simply to read the way he relates to the people and events developing around him. After the disappointment of ""Havana Bay,"" ""Wolves"" was a welcome return to the high quality this series has maintained. Now, on to ""Stalin's Ghost."""
3,"Not much of a mystery or suspense, lots of misery","If you want a mystery, look elsewhere. If you are willing to delve into the lives of people living within the area immediately adjacent to the Chernobyl nuclear reactor site, this is a useful read. Renko's disfavor with his superiors once again sends him to a godforsaken place even worse than Cuba or Siberia. The author is a skillful writer but there are only so many ways to describe desolation and depression."
2,Very confusing and disjointed,"Wolves Eat Dogs, my first book by Martin Cruz Smith seemed poorly written, confusing, and the kind of book where you should have already read all the author's previous works in order to figure out what is going on. I was lost trying to discern who was who amidst the myriad of potentially important secondary characters. I was disappointed in the character development of most of the people in the book. I had high expectations for this author and was disappointed because it seemed like some of the verbiage was a direct translation from Russian to English; it was disjointed and didn't make sense sometimes. The setting in the ruins of Chernobyl were extremely intriguing and the plot was wrapped up in the end, however it was confusing along the way. Don't waste your time unless you are a fan of this guy's work."
1,save your money,"I have read all his books and his recent stuff just continues to go downhill. Rose was the biggest waste of time. This is the same garbage. If you want to enjoy a good Russian mystery series, read Kaminsky's books about Rostnikov."
2,Terribly mediocre,"This novel seems so rushed and half-hearted. It doesn't come close to the early Trilogy of Renko novels. Character relationships seem undefined and unbelievable; the use of a mute child for Renko to talk to as a source of exposition seems amateurish; Renko initiates another sexual encounter but this time there's no connection or passion; the plot and climax aren't nearly as powerful as they should be, it left me with one of those ""THAT was it?"" feelings. Renko's antagonists clearly state their intentions to slow him down over and over again and in ways that are far too obvious; where did the subtlety go in Cruz Smith's writing? Maybe Renko should have been left alone after Red Square."
4,NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS HOPED BUT STILL VERY STRONG!,"I am huge fan of Smith's, what a talented, quietly lyrical writer! I absolutely LOVED Gorky Park so I had to give this one a shot too ... The mystery with the salt is great, though I have to admit the pay-off wasn't quite what I'd been hoping for; I won't spoil that surprise here. I thought the romance in this really worked and the scenes with the orphan were at times slow and other times very frustrating.I just wish the plot has been a little more gripping. What keeps me coming back to Smith is his mastery of all things Russian, and now, all things Chernoybyl too. Overall, still a highly acclaimed, very talented writer. Give him a shot, he's a lot of fun!!"
4,You will never add salt again,"A great piece by Martin Cruz Smith. Inspector Renko is at it again.His investigations take him to Prypiat, of Chernobyl fame.As Renko invastigates a strange suicide, the life of the people in and around Prypiat and Chernobyl is shown in detail.The book is worth buying, if only for the description of life in and around Prypiat and Chernobyl. The story itself is an added bonus."
3,By no means his best,"Rather disappointing, not up to Red Square and Gorky Park standard- the occasional flash of style, but you have to wade through quantities of stodge to get there."
3,2 1/2 stars -- Hoped for better,"Last year, I read Smith's Havana Bay and found it lacking. As I approached Wolves Eat Dogs, I was sincerely hoping that it would be closer to Gorky Park than Havana Bay. Alas, it was not. Perhaps it is not fair to compare all of Smith's works with my 25-year memory of Gorky Park, which I thought was fantastic. Renko's sense of melancholy and the depressing portrayal of life in Chernobl was simply too much for me. The usual zip simply was not present. I have Stalin's Ghost on the bookshelf. Hopefully it will prove to be closer to Gorky Park that this was. If not, I will have to pass on Smith's future works."
1,"At most, a travel guide to Chernobyl.","Smith's Arkady Renko series has run out of gas with this book.A non existent plot, devoted to the merits of our hero's tripto Chernobyl, populated by a bizarre cast of wooden characters invites the question: ""Honey, do I really need to finish this 335 page piece of excess, or, can I go to sleep now?"""
3,"A thoughtful, if dated, romance.","Mary Roberts Rinehart was a pioneer in American mystery writing. This is not a mystery, but rather a romance set during the First World War."
3,Hospital lethargy?,"I came prepared to enjoy this performance. I have no objection to juxtaposing historically-informed musical values with post-modernist staging. I like counter-tenors; why, some of my best friends, etc. Nevertheless, I found Admeto mildly soporific, but I'm not sure why. The singing was mostly quite good, although Matthias Rexroth's voice is apparently so small that he needed a contact mike to project. The orchestra is stylish and well conducted. Perhaps the problem is the opera itself, which lacks ""timing"" and thrust, both dramatically and musically. In any case, I'll keep the DVD in my collection, but I suspect I won't hasten to watch it again."
2,"A Very Disapointed Fan, Universal!!!","Put together a very nice Trilogy Box, with part 3 in DTS, but the other two DVD's still in DD 5.1. Why???I bought ones a time already the first two part's, in DD 5.1.Now DTS is much nicer, and was waiting for this box set.Why not make two box set, with and without DTS???This is sloppy Universal!!!!I did cancel my order for the Trilogy for that reason, and bought only part tree!"
5,Rawr. [Blu-ray preview],"At last! High def Spielberg dinosaurs!Grated, writing this 10 weeks prior to release I have not actually seen the discs. However, one of the reasons for the delays in releasing Spielberg films has been his insistence on quality transfers.What has me most excited is that this set does indeed include DTS surrounds. Jurassic Park was the first commercial release to utilize Universal's proprietary digital surround sound system. For the initial DVD releases of the first two films, if you wanted DTS you had to buy the edition that specifically had DTS instead of Dolby Digital surrounds (which I did). I remember running the staff previews for this film during dry runs for all four prints my theatre had in 1993, and the effect was truly amazing; it was a dramatically startling change from analog stereo, as incredible as the CGI/puppet dinosaurs themselves."
5,Has not been this great since they were in the theater!,"Movies that deserve to be on BluRay, and well worth the purchase. And with this revival I showed the JP movies to my kids. They loved them...and younger than I was when I saw it in the theater...they were not as scared as I was at 16. Tons of fun!"
4,great collection for the price,I rarely give anything a five so don't underestimate this 4 star rating. Great collection and the price was perfect (about 15)
5,Jurassic Park Adventure Pack,"Had to have the ""pack"" someday they won't be on Weekend tv any more and I would miss them. Really enjoy all 3"
4,Jurassic Park 3 sucks,"I think the first two Jurassic Park movies were excellent and nicely planned out but as far as the third one goes I think it is just plain junk and was most likely made in a hurry.The third one appears to not be very planned out. I'd hate to see a 4th one come out. Jurassic Park is one of those movies that should have stopped after second one.I gave it a 4 only because of the first two.I don't suggest any one watching 3rd one if a Jurassic Park fan,because what a disappointment it was."
5,Jurassic Park - The Set,"THIS . . . is the way to Buy it. THIS . . . is the way toOWN it . . . It's delight in Fantasy . . . BUT, it so Vividly suggestive.An Ideal Gift Presentation . . ."
4,Alternate Packaging??,"The pictures for this product show a tri-fold case in a box that opens with two doors on the front. This looks really cool, and is what I was expecting. However, the one I received has the tri-fold case in a basic slip cover. Not a big deal, but I was kind of looking forward to the cool packaging. Has anyone else had this happen? Still 4 stars for the incredible price!!"
3,DTS missing?,"This is more a review of the box set. My room-mate has the 2disc box set (before JIII came out) and I have the DTS edition of Jurassic Park. The difference between the DTS 5.1 on mine and the Dolby Digital on his is astounding. Remember that Steven Spielberg pioneered DTS (Digital Theatre Sound) and this was the first movie to have it. Do yourself a favour if you have a home theatre system and make sure you buy these movies separately with the DTS track on them. It's unbelievable. And with Spielberg signing on to direct Jurassic Park IV and Michael Crichton possibly writing it I would suggest staying away from box sets for the most part unless, like Godfather, you can be sure another sequel is impossible.EDIT - FEB 2011 - of course with the trilogy now available on Blu-ray there's really no reason to try and track down this item anymore.Blu-ray listing -Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy (Blu-ray + Digital Copy)"
3,Second Movie Didn[t Work,"The movie was great, but when we got to the second movie in the middle the movie kept going but there wasn't any sound which was a disappointment on Christmas Day. Tried second DVD player and samething happened - movie was great so far but product was not."
5,YES!,"I love the franchisee, What better way to have it than on Blu-Ray and Digital and have the statue. Can't wait for the 3-D release."
3,"Interesting product, poorly done.","The Jurassic Blu-ray trilogy is very nice, but the statue of the dinosaur isn't that great. I bought it as a collector, but mine arrived missing one finger of the T.rex hand and there are some flaws in paint application. I wish the people that made this thing had been more careful when packing it, because, i only saw the model after taking it of off the box and then I realized it was damaged. Probably Amazon won't replace it, since I can't ship it back from all across the world again, as I live in Brazil."
4,Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy,"I ordered this because my grandson really enjoys watching this series. It is an activity that we do together. It is an excellent value and quality. We have watched this series several times over Christmas break and he never grows tired of it. In addition,I also must say that ordering form Amazon is easy, convenient, and shipping is prompt."
1,Extremely bad image for such a new film.,"There is a terrible issue with what some are calling ""grain"" on JURASSIC PARK. But I've seen blu-rays which show film grain, and in this case, it appears to be something else. I've become accustomed to film grain, and I've even grown to appreciate it as part of this artistic medium. With JURASSIC PARK, it looks like static or white noise...especially during the scene where Hammond shows the DNA film to the park's four guests.If you've seen THE AFRICAN QUEEN on blu-ray, then you know that there is no reason this problem should exist. JURASSIC PARK was shot in a more controlled environment with such greater technology. If they can make THE AFRICAN QUEEN look as good as it does (it looks beautiful, and stunningly sharp), then this film, which is more than 40 years younger, should look at least as good.There must be a defective batch of discs, which were released. Because it really is unwatchable."
3,Wrong Slipcase/Cover,"I ordered this great collection, thinking that I was going to receive the elaborate tri-fold cardboard case (as shown in all the customer images). Instead I received (twice--because I returned it) a cheesy paper slipsleeve. One of the main reasons why I bought the DVD set was because of the case, as it folds out as if to resemble the actual gates of jurassic park. This is a great movie trilogy and should be owned by all movie lovers, but I am very displeased with Amazon's service and false advertising (in a sense)..."
5,Enjoyable dinos,"It is great to be able to have all of these great movies in one pack, and it is a trilogy that I never get tired of viewing."
1,love the movies HATE THE PRODUCT,"when I got this ,the first disc ""Jurassic Park' has a huge flaw in it ,it looks like someone stuck a hot knife throughit and is completely unplayable, the whole reason I got this colletion is for the first movieThe only saving grace was that it came with digital copies"
5,Love,My husband love jurassic park. It was a xmas gift. Dont arrive in the time that i was expecting but its here and he love it!!!
5,Excellent price for the classic trilogy,"Of course, the first one was better than the proceeding sequels, but for the price I couldn't find a better deal"
2,Waste of money,"I received this set as a Christmas gift to replace my other 3 Jurassic Park DVD's. What a piece of crap! Universal should be ashamed to call this a blu ray and claim it is ""digitally remastered"". The picture quality is terrible! Blurry and grainy. Dinosaurs should not come across as grainy! If I had bought this for myself I'd have returned it after viewing the first DVD. My non-blu ray DVD's of this set look much better than this and I couldn't be more disappointed. Amazon should pull all these or offer them for about $5.00.The only reason I give this 2 stars opposed to one star is because the movies themself are great."
3,"Great start, dull middle, better end","Jurassic Park is fabulous for dinosaur fans. The Dinosaurs are great, the acting is decent, the plot good. It is a fun thrill ride. The Lost World is only like a Godzilla adventure with great CGI, and was disappointing. Better plot, script salvaged the III. I would rate #1 a 5, #2 a 2 and, #3 a 4. None of them were particularly horrifying abut the dinosaurs close up were fantastic."
2,Case is aweful,"This is not a review of the movies. They are great, duh.This is a review of the case. Not so great.The movies are constantly falling out equalling tons of scratches. They don't pop in, they just sit there loosly. I hope this is just mine, but beware."
5,Love these movies,"I bought this recently because I had fond memories for the first film, and ok memories for the second and third films. Since they don't seem to sell the first movie separately any more, this is the thing to buy unless you want to go to a used movie store. The first movie is amazing and stands the test of time, and the other two remain entertaining if nothing else."
4,Starts out strong,"I'm ocd about my movie collection so I had to have all three, but the 4 stars is for the first Jurassic Park and the first one only..."
4,PS3 Grain Fix,"I have seen a pixely grain problem on many Blu-Rays, so I finally went online to seek a fix. The solution seems to be finding the PS3 video option ""1080P 24Hz Output (HDMI)"" and setting it to Off. When I did that, the grain problem went away.As for the movie itself, it's amazing how real and scary the dinosaurs look. Hard to believe it's almost twenty years old.One big flaw is the overuse of the theme song, especially during the helicopter ride to the landing pad. A soaring, catchy piece of brassy music played over and over becomes sheer torture."
1,Not biting.,"Hi Def digest says picture quality is 3.5 out of 5 stars for 1, 3 for #2 and 4 for # 3. When Blu ray first appeared, studios took pride and spent money to upgrade their ""classics"" and blockbusters. ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""North By Northwest"" all the Connery Bond pictures. Now they seem to have found a way to make them good enough and we suckers seem to be ok with that. Today I stop being okay with that and will not be purchasing these discs. Also, they cram each disc with so many special features to save a whopping $1.50 on an extra disc and the picture quality suffers."
5,Xmas Gift,Got this as a Christmas gift for my son. So I haven't viewed it yet. Gotta wait until after Christmas!!
3,Time has not been kind to this set,"On release this was a fantastic set and justifiably so. Years later the warts are easier to see. The biggest issue to me is the role of the children. Too prominent, too stupid and in many scenes they should not have been there at all. Having said that some of the adults were not too smart either and these days it is not unreasonable to expect a more balanced story line. The dinosaurs were smart but the story line is really too weak for repeat viewing. I rate this as 5 star for kids but only three for adults."
2,Trilogy only?,"Ok,I know everyone is stoked about the trilogy (although, the negative reviews I've read have noted that the Blu ray transfer was subpar), but I was actually looking forward to just the first movie being released on Blu ray. I'm sure that will come out at some point, but I'm disappointed that I have to either buy all three movies, or wait indefinitely. When I went onto blu-ray.com, there is no projected release date for the first installation. Anyway, that's my gripe."
4,My boys love these movies!,"I have twins that are crazy about dinosaurs and love these movies. First movie is my favorite, but the boys like the third of the set the best."
2,Save your hard earned money,"O.K., I don't think there is anyone on the planet that is as picky as I am when it comes to Blu-ray picture quality. When my ""favorites"" finally hit Blu-ray, I have a tendency to snatch them up due to the wait on coming to Blu. This set DOES NOT warrant investing in due to a poor quality picture. My ""Park"" regular DVDs are far better than this so-called Blu-ray rip-off. Don't these studios even remotely look at the final product before they release them? Or is it just the ever lovin' dollar and cashing in on sales from customers that have waited far too long for their faves? I tend to think it's the ever lovin' dollar. I would not recommend spending the $50 bucks on this crappy version. Hopefully these sets will gather dust on store shelves and the studios will get their act together and clean these titles up where they can truthfully be advertised as Blu-ray copies. Presently... NOT SO!"
3,Bad Quality,"I bought the Blu-Ray discs, and as others have pointed out, the quality is terrible. If you already own the DVDs, stick to that!"
5,"Looks great, good price","This was purchased as a gift for my mom. It turned out well, shipped on time, and visually was great for Jurassic Park fans."
4,Pretty sweet!,"I got this DVD for my mom for her birthday and she was so excited when she opened her present! She is a monster/dinosaur fan so she was completely in love.I was very impressed with how fast it was delivered and how amazing the clarity was on this DVD collection. I bought this wonderful set brand new, still in the plastic wrapping, but when my mom and I watched the second and third movie, the DVD actually froze for one second and then continued. Just the one freeze-up on each DVD, but besides that nothing else happened. It bummed me out that a brand new movie would do that considering we just opened it and it had not been touched by anyone else except the manufacturers.Besides those two freeze ups with the two DVDs, the movies were incredible! Thanks!"
5,Great Entertainment,"These movies are great entertainment....my kids (6,8,19) love these as do I. Watched them many many times , the price is unbeatable for all 3 in one box set.Does ANYONE know who is playing the MUSIC during the opening where Universal movie scenes are being shown?? I can't find anything about this music!!"
1,Very Bad Picture Quality,"To be honest.. I have movies older than Jurassic Park and I am fully satisfied with their picture quality. I must admit that this one is the worst blu ray disc I ever purchased. It's very grainy, pictures are not sharp in 90% of the frames. Believe me the bad picture quality has got nothing to do with my TV. Other movies are crisp on my TV. It's hard to believe that they did a blu ray conversion for this collection. Looks like they copied a VCD or VHS into blu ray. Will not recommend to own as a collection. Rent a DVD from some place if you have not seen this before. Or wait for some good HD version to be released in future to add it to your collection."
1,Horrible Blu-ray transfer. Don't buy it.,The picture quality of these films on Blu-Ray is really disappointing. It really feels like Universal just took the Jurassic Park DVD format and upconverted it to Blu-Ray. It's so grainy. I only really care about the original Jurassic Park film as well. It's insult to injury when they force you to buy all 3 films and they all look like Hell. I wish I could return the item for a refund.
4,Jurassic Park Goodness!,"Okay this DVD set pretty much rocks. And its certainly the best deal for the price.The only place that I have noticed a less than stellar video quality was during the first movie, during the scene at the visitors center with the Mr. DNA guy.... (BINGO DINO DNA...) There was as lot of static in that scene. Other than that the quality was superb.Where this movie really shines is as always the audio department. If you have a good home theater you will not be dissapointed. It has been remastered into 7.1 surround.Great box set..."
5,jurassic park ultimate trilogy,when i received it the box inside it broken so the discs not stick to itbut i am very disapointed
5,great combo,"If you are a Jurassic Park fan, this is a must have for your movie collection. It's a great set."
4,Not the best movies perhaps but should look great on Blu-ray,"I think I've got all three movies on VHS and DVD, decided to get them in Blu ray format for the higher quality image. It's been some time since I've seen any of the stories, #1 might be best, but the dinosaurs are still some of the best you'll see on screen.If you liked the movies on tape or DVD, go ahead and get the Blu-ray- the improved image should be a real treat for you as will the new extras."
3,"Inconsistent video quality, awesome audio.","I am finding what many of the bad reviews have already offered up, so I won't rant. Very inconsistent video quality. At times VERY grainy and at other times of blu ray crispness. Audio quality is superb. The scene with T-Rex is wonderful. Using a sound bar with subwoofer makes the living room shake when T-Rex roars. Overall, worth it if you get it at a discount (I got the Amazon $29.99 deal). I would wait to see if the price goes down after awhile. Video quality disappointing, audio quality awesome."
2,"Blu Ray waste, in my opinion","I'm half an hour into the first film, and i have to say that i feel my old DVD copy has the exact same picture quality. The only bonus about this set, to me, is the digital copies.If you have the DVD's, don't waste your money on this set."
5,Childhood Memories. Great Transfer.,"Modern directors just don't get the financing to create such huge movies like this anymore. Peter Jackson was probably the newest entry on the list of ""creator of worlds"" directors. Inception was close but close in the same way Batman is which is to take existing locations and beef them up a bit. The sets built for Jurassic Park are legendary and still remain at Universal Studios. There is something about creating everything realistically that lends a certain spatial familiarity.The transfer is fantastic. The picture and sounds are great and it's wonderful to see the groundbreaking special effects, in HD (they hold up quite well). Grab this pack and you won't regret it.P.S. I believe this should be required viewing for children ages 7-11, just will always remain a classic."
4,Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy,"The movies were not remastered to bluray quality . Lost world was the better picture, the rest were spotty. It was a must have for my collection but kind of disappointed."
5,Excellent Cinema,"The first Jurassic Park is one of my all time favourite movies. Having the trilogy makes for a great movie night! What makes it even better are all of the great special features with interviews, shorts and commentary. Definitely worth the buy if you're a dinosaur fan!"
1,Had problems viewing all 3 DVD's,"I had problems viewing all 3 DVD's in the collection. Each one of them had areas where it would ""freeze up"". I was unable to watch any of the movies from start to finish due to poor quality of the DVD's. I have not had any problems with watching other DVD's in my player either before or after trying to watch this set so I do not think it is my DVD player. (The DVD player was purchased this year.) The DVD set I purchased was used so that's what I get for trying to save some money."
1,$50 for one movie?,"Sure you get three, but I personally won't ever watch the two sequels. In my opinion they were awful thus I am disappointed to not see an a la carte option on the movies. Perhaps by release date they will have that option. Everyone gets their opinion but I gotta believe I'm not alone in thinking all-or-nothing is in poor taste."
4,Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy (+ Digital Copy),These films are classics. The set is great and the specials are worth the cost. I definitely recommend this to Spielberg and SciFi fans.
5,Awesome,I really love it!! the T-rex statue is made very well and it is just awesome and it's setting next to my other statues. In my opinion since I am a Jurassic Park fan I think it's really epic!! :D... the blu ray is awesome as well :)..
5,Awesome!!!!,Great picture and sound. They really did a good job remastering this DVD set and putting it all together in one compact set
5,AWESOME!!!!,Its Exactly what i ordered and what i wanted. i got all three Jurassic Parks!!!!! product was brand new and got sent to me quick fast and in a hurry!!!!!
4,Jurassic Park Trilogy,"If you like dinosaur movies, these are it. Personally liked all of them about the same Lots of action and great looking special effects!"
2,One defective disk,One of the disks (the movie Jurassic Park) was defective. It froze in the T-Rex scenes. The other two disks were fine. I enjoyed the better definition of Blu-ray.Now I have to buy Jurassic Park again because sending the product back to Amazon is almost as expensive as buying a new movie.
3,Picture quality is not good,"Pros:1. The movie, a must have for Jurassic Park fans.2. DTS-HD 7.1 Audio, very impressive, if you have a good set of home theatre.Cons:1. The picture of the blu-ray verion is so grainy like old DVD-5 (4.7GB) movies.2. The price, I bought it at 29.99 during black friday deals week but its original price is 49.99. For its low picture quality, it is not worth the money, but for 29.99, it is a great deal."
1,Sucks,I bought this item yes it took almost two months to get to me. And I use a ps3 to watch movies and this DVDs format is not being supported by the ps3! And so I plug in my DVD player and it says wrong format on the side is the screen!! We waiting about 5 minutes and it starts by itself. Overall it becomes a issue cus of the format of the DVD cd. Very unsatisfied!!!
4,A good package deal,Worth the money if you like Jurassic Park series. Well packaged and easy to use. Bought them for my daughter (she is 5) and of course loves them. Worth the money.
5,Don't stress over grain.,"The Blu-ray edition is a definite upgrade over DVD. Don't be dissuaded by the folks who complain about ""grain"" in indoor scenes. Not a big deal, really. I own the Jurassic Park DVD as well, and the Blu-ray version is vastly superior both in picture and sound. If you look carefully, the DVD also has grain in the same scenes, except that it's not as noticeable because of DVD's lower resolution. Maybe the filmmakers could have done a better job transferring the picture to the 1080p definition. But if you want to own a copy of Jurassic Park, this Blu-ray edition is the best rendition of the movie to date."
5,Another classic beautifully remastered!,"I had been waiting for these films to make their Blu-Ray debut. And in my opinion they don't disappoint. Though I recommend you purchase the set from Best Buy.I bought that set because you can get them in a Steel Case, and it contains 6 discs vs the 3 you get for 10 dollars less.You get the Blu-Ray/DVD/ and Digital copies of all 3 films.The new documentaries are a nice insight into each film along with all the original features added in with them.I only found the first movie to have some graininess, and that was with only a select few in door scenes. Not a problem for me.Overall the Blu Ray editions are beautiful, much cleaner and crisp then the originals, flawless sound. I watched the first movie and all the new Return to Jurassic Park features tonight. I sampled the other 2 Blu Ray editions on my PC and found them to be flawless as well."
3,Jaws Before Sharks,"This entire set is basically Jaws with dinosaurs instead of sharks. If a player is not a well known actor in any of these movies, expect to see him eaten by the dinosaurs. These movies are exciting to watch and the special effects are first-class, but the viewer will know who will survive from the start of the movie. The viewer is there to see how the minor characters meet thier demise and how the major characters survive."
3,Great movie!,"Jurassic Park is a great movie! JP2: Lost World is decent. JP3 is horrible. How horrible? Well, they couldn't sell it without bundling it with JP1, that's how horrible.Picture quality isn't that much better than VHS. It doesn't look like HD quality, a bit grainy."
3,"Still fun movies, but poor quality picture","Keeping this review short. The films are still fun to watch. However, the picture quality, as some other reviewers have indicated, is very poor for a blu-ray release. Not impressive blu-ray title as far as its technical aspects."
4,Just Fun!,What a great just fun trilogy. Maybe a bit far fectched but a fun set of movies to sit and lose yourself with your family.
4,Excellent,"his product is as advertised. Great movies (except for the third, which was kind of cheesy)and great accessories. All in all, a satisfactory product. That is all I have to say right now."
3,Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy (Blu-ray + Digital Copy),"Ya, there is/are some grain issues,...................... What were they NOT thinking ?Sit at least 10 feet away from your HDTV and it looks somewhat better ! :o)"
2,This is a CRAPPY recording of it - SOMEONE played SOUND GOD!,"Jurassic Park ADVENTURE Pack - I do NOT ""recommend"" the Jurassic Park III DVD of this pack.In Jurassic Park III the Sound in a few scenes of the DVD is not as good as the VHS of it.SOME IDIOT decided to play SOUND god!When the action is LOUD THEY decided to turn it down when the DVD was made, & then turn it UP when it was no longer loud, so the sound goes UP and DOWN!!! VERY annoying!This TOTALLY ruined Jurassic Park III DVD that I got for my birthday! I'll go back to my VHS of it. IT was FINE!LEAVE THE SOUND ALONE WHEN YOU MAKE ANYTHING! WE have fingers that can turn it down on OUR controller if it's too loud!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not as good as other rough guides,"I generally really like the Rough Guide and have used it in maybe 10 or 15 countries. However, the one for Ecuador is poor. I moved to Ecuador a year ago and bought the 2010 version as soon as it came out. I have been consistently disappointed by the lack of information it has and is even completely missing common and well-known restaurants and hotels. I have a car and it does not have helpful information on how to get places other than by bus. I am usually not a fan of Lonely Planet, but for this country, it is much better."
3,not great,"I ordered this guide and the Lonely Planet Guide. I had previously toured Costa Rica using the Lonely Planet Guide and it worked out very well. This time I wanted to see if there was any additional information in the Rough Guide that would be helpfull. I have not yet gone to Eucador so I can not comment on the accuracy, but the detail in the Lonely Planet guide is much greater than that of the Lonely Planet Guide. Besides that it is much more compact. 440 pages vs 590. Basically Lonely Planet is more concise and more informative. If you are going to Ecuador and have room for one book, I recommend Lonely Planet rather than Rough Guide."
5,Hermosa,"Leí la versión en español de Juanita, La larga. Me cautivó desde el primer momento. Me encantó el amor de Juanita y Don Paco, y cómo ella llevó a cabo todo su plan para que la relación tuviera bases firmes en el amor. Hermosa novela de Juan Valera."
3,A long rant,"While well written, this collection of essays is essentially not much more than a series of rants of how bad things are. Without proposing any real solutions beyond a couple abstract ideas, Howard makes life seem hopeless.It's like reading a book that for 200 pages tells you that you're going to die. While it may be right, it does nothing to improve the situation. I will give credit to Howard for showing reasonable political objectivity, but that at best raises this to 3.5 stars."
4,Fact vs. Fiction,"Being a big fan of both the Rurouni Kenshin manga and anime I had to get this book. Not only is it full of pictures from the manga but also character profiles, files on history of the Meiji Restoration and the real people the characters are based on. Chapters on the battles, questions about Kehshin's past and a interview with Nobuhiro Watsuki help complete the book.I had to take away a star because the book came out around 1996 so it covers the story only up to Act 102."
4,Mostly worth your money,"I have to disagree with Del Keyes. Although this book is basically a trip down memory lane, it does have a lot of hitorical info not mentioned in the book or the anime. There was also some character info that wasn't mentioned in the anime or manga either, like beshimi's poison spiral needle was actually as powerful as a gun. Overall if you're a rurouni kenshin fanatic (like me) and have exactly $15.90 burning a hole in your pocket, then this is definitely a good buy.- Ryan Hallos"
4,Good for avid fans of the Kenshingumi.,"This book came to me in excellent condition and I consider it a great addition to my manga shelf. In only two things was I dissapointed, 1 that basically the book is but a rehash of everything I'd already read in the manga series. Nothing new really, some interesting facts once in a while but that's it. The best part of the book was the pages of full color pictures in the front. Excellent drool worthy and artistic pictures. The poster is an added bonus that makes this book worth buying. My second dissapointment though was that it's nearly impossible to remove the poster from the book...maybe I'm just stupid and the poster is supposed to stay in the book...huh. So yes, good book if you know nothing of Rurouni Kenshin but bad if you like to take out posters and frame them. I give it four stars."
1,mini-leash too mini,"The Flexi Classic extra small is supposed to be a good size for small dogs, but it doesn't say it must also be for small people!! The handle of the leash is too small for even 3 of my fingers to squish into and it's even too small for my 10 year old to hold comfortably. Unless you have VERY small hands, or you are sending a VERY small child to walk the dog(!), I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Dissapointed.,"I got this book because I struggle with bulimia myself but found it to be more about her relationships with her family, her son, and her ex-husband than about her relationship with her bulimia. The writing style was hard to follow and confusing, which made the plot hard to follow as well and dissapointing. While it is a story of strength and courage, it isn't as focused on bulimia as it leads itself to be."
1,Severely Disappointing,"An avid reader of books of all types, including ones such as this, I was originally thrilled to come across this book. But once I picked it up, I had to force myself to the very end, which is not usually the case. In a word, awful; and I hope that it may have been due to translation. Where was the editor? Choppy and simple, it is not worth picking up because there are so many other more poignant novels of the same genre out there."
5,A beautiful story,"You feel Ximena in the room, with you, telling you about life and love, for yourself and for others..."
1,The worst I've read,"I've read a lot of books on eating disorders and this one is by far the worst one I've read. I'm assuming English is not the author's first language because a lot of the book didn't seem to make sense. I was really excited to read this book, since I struggle with bulimia and depression, but I was really disappointed."
3,"Great show, not so great deal","If you don't care much about box sets, and just want the show, then I recommend buying separately. You can save up to 50 dollars that way.Other than that; great show!"
1,So freaking boring!,"Im a freshman student and I had to read this book for a history class. It was the most boring thing that Ive had to read in years. The words go in one ear and out the other. If you dont have much of an attention span, or just dont like history period then this book isnt for you. It makes a good coaster tho."
2,Disappointing,"After being blown away by Monastic Trio and Journey in Satchidananda I bought up Alice Coltrane's entire back catalogue. The CDs are variable to say the least. This has got to be the worst of the lot. Three of the pieces are Hare Krishna chants by her students from the Vedantic Centre. They obviously arent musicians as the rhythm is quite often suspect. The final 19 minute track features some fine organ work but is totally ruined by the atrocious drumming of her son John Jr.The only reason I gave it two stars is because of the track Ganesha, which is a beautifully played harp piece. All in all though this CD is best avoided."
5,A wonderful story!,"I rarely give a book 5 stars, but I loved Darkness at Foxglove Corners. It offers everything that makes cozy mysteries cozy--intrigue, mystery, romance, cooking, gardening and lovable pets. Subtle hints had me suspicious about practically everyone in the story! I read the book on my Kindle, which I usually reserve for my train commute from work. But this time, I spent part of my Saturday reading the last several chapters because I didn't want to wait to find out what happened. Well done, Dorothy Bodoin. Darkness at Foxglove Corners is a fun read!"
4,Mayhem in Bucolic Michigan,"With her home demolished by a tornado, Jennet Greenway believes rural Michigan is the perfect place to re-locate. She and her and her collie, Hawley look forward to their new home. Jennet loves everything about Foxglove Corners, including her nearest neighbor and her neighbor's breathtaking garden.Shortly after moving, Jennet reads in the newspaper about a thirty year old journal discovered in the rubble of the tornado. As the newspaper prints chapters from the journal, an old murder is revealed. Everyone throughout the area seems to be captivated by the newly revealed murder.Thus begins Dorothy Bodoin's debut mystery novel, ""Darkness at Foxglove Corners."" The characters are well defined, but full of surprises. The story is fascinating.Her next novel should be another treat."
1,big let down,this game is a huge let down.you can't control your car on any of the tracks.Setting up your car is so difficult unless you really know alot about setting a car up.
5,lexx- marty simon,"the music Mr Simon contributes to the series is what first drew me to the show. His musical interpretation of the content is unsupassed by any composer to movies, television or plays...not only does he create hauntingly beautiful scores but he contains in his CD's a sampling of every genre of music today - salsa to opera...I have even created a bellydance to ""Feppo's Party"". I am buying another set (the movie soundtrack and the tv series soundtrack to keep as a back-up should my current discs become damaged. There is something for everyone on these cds."
3,Decent House Music,This is a decent collection of House Music. Not what I'd consider Classic (Old School) House but a form of House nevertheless. You can get your dance on to it.
4,Works great if you know what to do.,I have one of these that plastic wish I had the glass one. An if you get sick is because you didn't clean an sterilize good enough. If done proper will make you great brews.
1,carmmeggdon max damage,This game has very poor graphics and has no story I cannot recomnd this game to anyone
1,Never have been so disappointed in a product,"Purchased this sink two years ago in bisque. A month ago noticed that there was a spot about 1/4"" where the surface had eroded. A week later, I found another spot. I have treated this sink with the utmost care and was led to believe that it was a durable sink. Rohl said that they do not warranty this, but I could buy two products to touch up their sink that they market as very resilient. DO NOT BUY THIS SINK."
2,Horseshoe set,Horseshoes are fine but wooden box was warped and unusable. This is a big problem as the horseshoes are heavy and need a sturdy container.
4,lots of compliments,I got a great deal on this feminine necklace in 2007 and was able to find the matching earrings on another website. I love that the crown motif is delicate and subtle. The chain is just a basic chain.
3,It's not bad -- But it's not great,"It's only 10 bucks, that's a plus. And being only 10 bucks you kind of get what you pay for and this is no exception... The poster is 27x40 ""technically"", but it has a one inch boarder of white around the picture which is really troubling. I also don't like the printer they've used to print these off of -- They look ""alright"", but they're certainly not ink pressed and certainly not stock rolled. The poster in question suffers from a lack of vibrant coloring which you can't tell too much from far away, but when you get up on it it's very poor looking. I'm not upset with the purchase, as I said it's only 10 bucks -- but to have this framed, with this quality of print, by the seller is like 70 bucks -- Not really worth it. Not for the grainy overall quality you get in the end.I've ordered like 3 other posters from this seller so we'll see how they turn out. My hopes aren't riding too high right now, but I'll be content I suppose."
5,The Whole Horse Catalog,"I have been preparing for some time to get my first horse, which I now have.I have been doing tons of the reading, watching videos, asking questions of knowledgeable horse people, as well as hands on work with horses over the past few years. The information in this book is presented in clear and concise form that has proved, and continues to be, very helpful to me. Horse care and management requires such a vast range of knowledge. I highly recommend this book as a solid reference."
5,Very comprehensive,"This is the most comprehensive horse care book I own. I just love this new updated version. I also owned the 1985 edition and this new one has not only updated information, but more information. I highly recommend it to any horse owner or anyone interested in owning a horse (especially good for a first horse owner or lessee)."
2,not the whole story,This book lacks the information about the horse more info of everything else. The book put more effort into the apparel and activites of the horse. Than actually telling about horses and what they need.
2,Could be better...,I wasn't impressed with the images or the format of this book. With so many horse books out there you could do better.
2,No color pictures,I just received this book. I find it quite outdated. The drawings and illustrations are poorly done. There are only a few black and white pictures. Just beware that this is a 1998 book and I am sure you can find a more updated horse book than this one.
2,Bowl broke within 2 weeks,"Unbreakable?! Bumped the bowl and it shattered. Too bad, it was a really nice set. Just the right weight and size."
5,review,i got the movie pretty fast and love the movie. im glad the movie is still out my daughter will grow up with my childhood movie
4,Historical Document,"This is a great collection of works that changed the face of Christianity in the 16th century. Using original source documents compiled into this reader, Hillerbrand gives space to explore the major reformation movements of the Evangelicals (Luther), the Reformed Church (Calvin), as well as the Anabaptists and other movements so commonly reduced to the Reformation. I used this book for an undergraduate course on the History of Reformation Europe and found it to be an excellent source, especially when paired with John Olin's compilation of original source documents on the Catholic Reformation."
5,Protestant Reformation,"If you want to know how it all started and why and who the key players are, I highly recommend this book. I had to read it for a college course I was taking and as I read it, I truly appreciated it as required reading."
4,Three wonderful workouts for any level,"I own nearly 20 yoga videos, and recently added this to my collection. I love all three, but especially Water and Earth, and they are now the tapes I use most often. The best word I can use to describe them is ""pure"". This is simple yoga, no music, no seaside scenery, no ""get some rapport with the floor"" annoying rhyming. They are the perfect length for a squeezed-in yoga session (35-40 minutes), and revitalize and re-centre me even when I am very tired at the end of the day. A good investment."
5,The best Yoga tapes you can buy!,I started out with Total Yoga (their first tape) a fell in love with Yoga. Tracy and Ganga are great at explaining how you should breath and how you should hold the poses. I was very excited when they came out with the flow series. I have been trying other Yoga tapes and was just not satisfied with the lack of explaination and breathing technique. With the flow series there is no guess work and I feel confident I am doing the salutations correctly and I am breathing properly. Tracy and Ganga are very spiritual and inspirational. Namaste
3,Beginners Beware!,"The tape packaging and several of the reviews said this set was good for beginners, but beware! I am a REAL beginner (i.e. I don't know any of the poses at all) and this tape doesn't actually explain the poses; it just jumps right in. After trying the first tape once, I went out and bought Yoga for Dummies to learn the basics first.I think I will probably come to love and regularly use this set. I love the tranquil setting and gentle instruction by Tracey and Ganga; it will just take me a little time to work up to this set.Bottom line: if you're a real beginner like me, start with a *teaching* video, like Yoga for Dummies, to learn the poses. Then work your way up.Namaste!"
2,Not that great,"The same stuff basically in all three videos - they just speed up and add a few extra repetitions as you go. The narration is not relaxing, and they don't spend much time explaining the fine points of how to experience a pose - no mention of the bandhas which I think is kind of critical...Try Richard Freeman's Primary Series if you're serious..."
2,"Monotone, mediocre instruction","The level of detail in the instuction varies widely; some asanas are almost painfully dissected, others seemingly glossed over. Also, instruction is delivered in a very serious-sounding monotone. I would recommend the Yoga Zone tapes over these."
4,Where is Oh Donna??,"Just started updating my Cliff collection from album to cd....Always loved most of his stuff and my only issue with this one is that it's missing the song Oh Donna...I guess it was only on the American version? Still, why couldn't it be thrown on as a bonus track for those of us on the other side of the Atlantic?"
4,"Nice, but I've had better...","Compared to the top coats you typically find in the drugstore, this stuff is amazing. However, I bought the ""Seche Vite Dry Fast Top Coat High Shine"", and it's much better than the Liquid Glass. In my experience, the Seche Vite product really does dry faster, harder, and shinier.This top coat would be the best ever... if only I hadn't also tried the Seche Vite."
5,Better than the rest!,"I received this pinball game from my brother and sister in law (Hi Mark and Jackie) for Xmas 1999, after having a fantastic time with hours of fun on it's predecessor, Timeshock. Both are outstanding games! While most pinball games try to do too much (eg. multiple tables) poorly, this game tries to do one thing very well... on well oiled, awesomely realistic and utterly challenging game table that is fun, and full of new finds. A ten ball multiplay challenge, video game intergrated, and loads of lights and bumpers, combined with totally green-light graphics and sounds (so realistic, you can even hear the ball hit the glass if you smack it just right, like the real thing!), I give it 5 stars for playablility and fun factor. Full customizable play table, key controls (does not use a mouse or joystick, only keyboard). It and its predecessor equal, Timeshock, are the two best software games I have ever owned. Have a great 2000!"
5,Outstanding! The best computer pinball ever.,"If you buy just one pinball game, make it this one! The playfield was rendered on a SGI workstation, and looks simply stunning. The play is extraordinarily realistic. I can quite honestly say that this is the first computer pinball game I've played that makes you feel like you own your own pinball machine."
1,UGH! Hated it!,"This was the first Danielle Steel novel I read and it will be the last. While reading this I feld like she wrote this book in a day. There was no thought process whatsoever involved in this book. Bad grammer also! An example: ""And, afterwards, they and Paul...."" huh? This was really really bad. I guess that explains how she can pump so many books out. No thought goes into them!"
4,Great book....,"I really enjoyed this book. It reminded me so much of my life. It seems like a lot of people who have bad lives, really do keep on having the bad things keep on happening to them, and the ones with the easy lives, have easy lives forever!I didn't really like the ending when she brought a gun to scare Marcus, the photographer, though!!! I thought that was completely out of nowhere and did not match with the character's ""meek, sensitive, victim"" personality. It also did not make sense because she should have known that Marcus could have even gone to the cops after she did that, and made herself look even WORSE."
5,Malice,This is a really good story about abuse. I am not a regular reader but have been a fan of Danielle Steel for many years. It kept my attention and I read it in record time. I really enjoyed it.
1,Don't Bother,"I've read all of Danielle Steel's books and have loved them all. After reading one chapter in this book I wanted to throw it away! I was disgusted! I will not give this book any more of my time by reading it further, and I've never stopped reading a book before. Again I say....if you're thinking of reading this book....DON'T BOTHER"
2,"Good, but just like all the other Danielle Steel books","This book is just like every Danielle Steel book you've ever read. The plot goes something like this: girl in trouble, get's out of trouble herself, finds man, the end. There isn't much that's original to this book, and I kind of think that Danielle Steel writes her book in 'Mad Libs' style. She just changes the names of the characters, changes their occupations, and the color of the book, and wham... A new hardcover to sell for tons of money. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this book, unless you want to waste a mindless afternoon with brain candy."
1,Boring,"I don't see what's a big deal. This is first D. Steel's book I've read and it was average and shallow. I think this is the first and last of Mrs Steel books I'll read. Trust me, don't buy it!"
5,I loved this book! I recommended it to everyone!,Malice is a book that took my breath away! I was stuck reading the book so much my husband said i was neglecting him. This book is about a girl that goes through so many trials in her life that you don't want to put the book down you want to know what will happen next! I felt so sorry for the many things that happened to her i wish that i could reach out to her. this book was so good that it made the story almost seem real. i would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a book and doesn't mind getting a little emotional. i guarantee you will love it!
5,Keeps you on the edge.,"This book was a painful look at a character's life. Through the book, you tend to walk with her fears and tears, and cheer her on. This is one that really opens your eyes to soceity's cruelty."
4,Attention Getter!!!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was written to capture the reader so that you would not want to put it down. It was creative, exciting and heartbreaking. Danielle Steel readers will definately want to add this to their collection."
5,"Excellent, one of Steel's best!!","This book is one of Steel's best. I couldn't put it down. The story was told with such feeling that it made my heart ache for Grace. Granted it had some obscene content, but without it, it wouldn't have made the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a couple of spare hours, because you won't want to put it down."
5,You Just Can't Put It Down!!!!,"For all the D.S. lovers: Do not miss the oportunity of reading this book!!! I started reading it on one day, and every time I had to leave it to go to work I felt terrible and spent the rest of the day thinking about what was going on with Grace, and wishing I could be back and reading it. Danielle makes you feel all the pain and dispair Grace feels, the terror.... And at the end, it makes you hate those people who lie, and take advantage of public people to make money with the tabloids. It's really a lesson of life, more than any other book I've read, not to give up life, inspite of all the obstacles and tests life puts you through."
4,Malice,Arrived in excellent condition for having such an old copyright. Pages yellowed but was as described. Very satisfied with purchase.
3,The Dogs Loved It!,"I ordered the 8in1 Birdie Goof Balls-Large Bird, 0.7-Ounce treats. Since there were only 2 goof balls per package I ordered 2 packages for my Catalina Macaw, African Senegal & my 2 African Grey parrots. The order was fine & they came in when it was stated they would come in. The problem was my birds did not like them, but as any good Mama Bird would do I kept picking them up off the floor & offering them back to my birds. Well after a few times of doing that I decided this nonsense is for the ""Birds""! (sorry)Well guess what happened to the ""Birdie Balls?"" Yes you guessed it! The dogs got them!! The dogs loved them!! The dogs ate them & the dogs came back looking for more! Well if you ask me the ""Birdie Goof Balls'"" name should be changed to: ""Dogie Goof Balls!""So with that being said, I can tell you that I will not be ordering these ""Birdie Goof Balls"" for my birds again, & since they have bird seed in them I cannot order them for my dogs either.B. Jones"
3,Don't last long,"Well, they were interesting at first, but when the African Gray decided to put them to the test (her beak!) they didn't last very long - and they created quite a mess!"
3,UNKOWN ROAD is ok but ABOUT TIME is better,"The first time i heard UNKNOWN ROAD i was kinda dissapointed, but some songs are ok, if you really like this group then you should buy ABOUT TIME"
5,Good Choice,"if you like the hard punk, you must have this Cd, bougth this Cd, because i heard in a arcade game ""pro skater"", and i say to myself, it's the smart choice for this game, and i bougth, just for one song (homesick), but listen the rest of the songs i enjoy the whole album, it's a best albums that i been bougth.sorry for my english because i'm a hispanic.ES UNA CHIMBA DE ALBUM!"
4,Good But Not Amazing,"Im not gonna lie to you, i was expecting more going in to this. It is not bad and if it was any band besides Pennywise it would be outstanding... but for a Pennywise album it is average. It does have some GREAT songs which are Unknown Road, Homesick, Time To Burn, Nothing, Dying To Know & Slowdown. The rest could have been B-sides to any cd and they all sound alike... which is usual but in this case not very good. Most of the other songs are at least enjoyable and overall the cd is pretty good but i would reccommend only getting it after you have become a big fan and have most of their other work... it is much better."
4,Continuing the tradition.,"Big Bill's third release is chock full of guest artists including several that performed with his father, Muddy Waters, band. Guests include, Taj Mahal, Bob Margolin, Pinetop Perkins, Willie Smith, Paul Oscher and Bill Lupkin to name a few.Despite the guests, Big Bill's performance seems a little lack luster and slightly below his two earlier releases, the overlooked and underrated ""Nineteen Years Old""--available through Taxim.com and, the award winning ""Rising Son""--available here on Amazon.com. The two strongest cuts are those featuring the vocals of Taj Mahal, ""Strong Man Holler"" and ""You're Gonna Miss Me."" While nothing ground breaking on this CD, Bill certainly carries on the fine tradition of the Delta blues. Worth the purchase, but don't overlook the previous two releases."
1,Item no longer carried,"I purchased 2 of these 16 piece sets and the matching serving bowl and platter for a wedding gift. The bowl and platter shipped to the bride but the dishes were on ""back-order"". The bride loved the platter and bowl, but later I received an email that the dishes were not longer carried. Now I have a bride without matching dishes - BIG problem."
2,Unoriginal Police/Detective Thriller,"My problem with this story (of experienced police officers setting up a new police department)was that the characters and the plot were hard to believe. Loner hero, two sidekicks...one is smooth-talking ladies man, the other a hulking brute..Of course the mayor is involved in chicanery. A nice guy cop goes undercover in the mayor's business and you know as soon as you hear that, that the nice guy will get ""offed"" and he does. This author has been a cop and he has a PhD...what he does NOT have is an imagination..."
1,Totally lacking in useful information,"This spiral bound almost-a-pamphlet lists the 14 'super' foods that anyone could find on the net. This book gives you a weak two paragraph synopsis of each food followed by 8-10 recipes for that food that are hardly healthy. One of the recipes called for Cheez Whiz for crying out loud!This book is junk, find the super foods online (hint - look at the picture on the cover of the book as displayed above they are all there) and there are a plethora of free healthy recipes out there."
1,Not what it appears,"I was excited to see the book with recipes for the ""14 Super Foods"" after reading Steven Pratt's book, but was very disappointed. Yes, the recipes do use the ""14 Super Foods"", but also use such ingredients as shortening, Cheez Whiz, and yellow cake mix - hardly healthy! If you are interested in eating good, healthy meals made with the ""14 Super Foods"", don't buy this book!"
1,rubbish,this book is a joke! The author should know that sugar isn't good for you! Seems like all the author achieved was to destroy any benefit the Super Foods in the recipes would have. What a disappointment!
1,Super Foods Recipes,"The super foods listed are all healthy, disease fighting foods. However many of the ingredients used in the recipes are ingredients that I do not consider healthy. I am extremely disappointed with the recipes. I will not use any of the recipes in this book."
1,NOT AFFILIATED WITH DR. PRATT AND THE REAL SUPERFOODSRX BOOKS!,This book is in NO WAY related to Dr. Steven Pratt and the bestselling SuperFoodsRx series of books. Dr. Pratt was not a part of and in no way approves of any of the material contained in this book.
3,A little disappointed,"I expected the second book to be stronger in plot and character development...however, it was sad to see that the character followed in his father's disasterous footsteps. In my opinion, it could have had a better ending."
2,"the days of gimicy ""inter-active"" movies + a few celebs voices.","After Wingcommander III(a good game/movie exp) everyone wanted to jump on the ""inter-active"" movie train. these games(for the young and spoiled who can't remember the 90's) were A: go this way B: go that way, affairs. (just your type) Though I've seen some pretty lame stuff in games and TV today, this is classic lame with a capitol ""O"". Aside from starship control(with no physics value) and a few walkabouts, it's just another multipule choice affair with Shatner, Tekai, and Keonig for back ups. Why not just get 25th annaversery CD-ROM or Judgement Rites for that plus entertainment. For this pedeler Q push-off production, watch the guy with the slurred speech empediment incoherently rant about it on ""youtube."" now that's entertainment! -good rep of the game by the way-"
4,Great For Early Readers,"It's Valentine's Day, and Clifford the Big Red Dog has received LOTS of valentines! But he has a very special valentine for his neighbors, and it has to do with SNOW!This delightful book featuring Clifford and his beloved owner, Emily Elizabeth, is a Level 1 ""Hello Reader!"" book by Scholastic, Inc. Level 1 books are geared to children ages 3-6 (Preschool-Grade 1), and feature short sentences and stories made up of words that are important to remember and can be sounded out using phonics skills.In addition to being a colorful, easy-to-read story, Clifford's Valentines also includes a Word List in the back of the book made up of 41 words. Some of the words that are featured in this book and emphasized in the Word List are: and, boy, card, day, girl, happy, heart, is, letter, loves, park, snow, the, and woman.This is a nice book for Valentine's Day, but it can also be used year-round to help teach smaller children phonics and basic reading skills"
3,Western Wear of the Show Biz Variety,"I was expecting western wear of the real working cowboy. This is a book about the flashy over done show biz type of western wear. If that is what you are interested in, this is the book for you."
4,Western books,The book has great photos of old western wear and I love getting ideas from books like this. Great to look at
2,Crewman from Stark Incident's review,"A detailed account of the action lifted from the official documents with some behind the scenes insight to the legal procedings involved with a military investigation. Would have been a very good action/heroism/tragedy book. Lacks heart. Very formal. Written by lawyers. Authors never interviewed subjects. The next book written about the subject will be better. Missed key information about aftermath of incident, suicide by survivor, murder by lookout, and other readily available stories."
2,Crewman's perspective,"As a survivor of this unfortunate incident, I was angered that key facts about that night were missed. The author's did a fair job of restating facts that existed in official documents, but overlooked the testimony of the crew. I was glad to see several others write comments about this book, many whose names I recognize. I hope that future published works about the USS Stark will cover the story from the side of her proud crew, 37 of whom paid the highest price possible for our freedom."
2,not authentic enough,"it was a steril 3rd person look at us,not an interview decently done.obviously to avoid stepping on any toes,submitted by GMM3 B.T.MARTIN SSDF 1983-1987.USS STARK FFG-31"
3,Book Error,"There is some confusion with Lt(jg) Will Hanson and FC3 William R Hansen in the index. Hansen, William R is listed in the index on several pages, however the reference should actually be for Lt(jg) Will Hanson. The only page my brother (FC3 William R. Hansen) should be mentioned is on page 126 in the list of KIA. Seems like the authors were not aware of the similar names. Also, the cover picture is reversed showing a STBD list when it was actually to port (reversed negative see photo pg 21). Makes me wonder what other errors are present. Otherwise, as a family member of a lost shipmate the book gave me some insight as to what was happening while we were waiting for news about my brother. I never doubted the bravery of her crew, and this book reinforced it. Overall, I'm glad I got the chance to read it and welcome contact from any past crew members."
4,Short but detailed,"This is the only account of the ""Stark"" incident in the Persian Gulf and although the book is rather short it is full of useful details regarding the reason behind that terrible accident. The authors analyse the role of every member of the crew who had a critical position during the 20.00 - 24.00 shift at the night of May 17, 1987 and present the many errors commited and the bad luck of the US ship. During the phase of the Exocet attack, the captain was at the toilet and so was the operator of the Phalanx CIWS system! The officer in charge didn't maneuver the ship to give its systems a better field of view and the Iraqi aircraft was classified by an AWACS as a ""friendly"". The book is a fine source for everyone who wants to get a glimpse into modern naval warfare but it has only one map and some poor black and white photographs."
4,Very important historical account,"Despite my first review, this is a very important book and the only book about the USS Stark."
3,Expected more personal info.,"As a survivor of that night, I was hoping to read how my other shipmates are doing since this tragedy."
2,Another fig sailor's opinion.,"Another fig sailor's opinion., August 2, 2004Reviewer: 920 ""FC1 Bill Adams"" - See all my reviewsI'm ordering the book, though I respect the negative opinions of those who were there, especially Jeff Pearson, whom if memory serves I served with at Damneck after.I served aboard a fig 7 identical to Starke as an FC1, I was a qualified WCO, and taught WCO school after the Starke attack. I patrolled the same water on my fig, and watched the same aircraft follow it's targeting P-3 down the gulf many days.No-one will ever convince me it was an accident. The missiles were fired in exactly the manner I would fire at an FFG-7 class ship. Right down the cutouts, where both the 76MM and CIWS were least effective. I don't think that was by accident.Wish someone who was there would write a book."
2,Trophy Bass,"I ordered Deluxe Trophy Bass 2 and Trophy Buck Bundle, but that is not what I received. The original Trophy Bass was sent with no Trophy Buck Bundle. I will contact the seller and find out why the wrong merchandise was sent. The item was ordered on April 8, 2003, and was received April 19, 2003. The shipping time is not the problem, it is the item received. I will not buy from this organization again."
3,"Ok, but not inspirational","Tracey Rich instructs in a monotone, very seriously. That said, her instruction is sound and reasonably detailed, but I really just feel depressed after these tapes, despite the benefits of the yoga practice. Her flexibility is inspirational, but the tapes are not. I'd rather listen to Alan Finger (of yoga zone) or Brian Kest (either of whom are equally good instructors) any day."
2,Not for beginners,The reviews led me to believe that this yoga tape was for beginners. I didn't feel the instructions were complete enough and I had to keep looking up at the tape to see how to do the poses. I have never tried yoga before and do not recommend this tape for someone who is new to this form of exercise.
5,Best CD of all time,"This is the best CD of all time, hands down. No matter how many times you listen to My Wall, it still leaves me in a state of disbelief of how talented these guys are. Correction, were. Scott Radinsky was a great singer. Dennis is good, but he pales in comparison to Scott. If you buy one CD, buy this one. It's a great introduction to TFP and the whole punk genre."
4,Not as good as the rest,"Ten Foot Pole's a great band, but this, their first CD, is simply not as good as the rest. For starters, their old singer Scott is NOTHING compared to Dennis (who wrote most of the lyrics). His monotone singing really puts a damper on their excellent music and lyrics. And songs like Old Man (which is a high point on he album) are the very essence of Ten Foot Pole's great storytelling effect. Some other great songs include: World's Best Dad, Never Look Back, and Closer to Gray. While this CD is still better than most punk acts, Unleashed and Insider are way better and Dennis's voice is preferred over Scott's, it's a good thing he went off to play baseball and quit stifling the band. Also, check out their new album, Bad Mother Trucker."
2,"product as described, but slow shipping","the product is as described i payed extra for expedite shipping, and i received it a week after i placed my order, not happy."
3,Never Received the Book,"I never actually received the book so I cannot rate the book. However, I can rate the seller. Sandra's Gift Store was very responsive to my concerns when I had not received the book after 3 weeks and provided a prompt refund. I still have not received the book."
1,never got my book,I never got my book for school and when i checked amazon.com to track my order and it does show up. and there is no number or email to get in contact with. this was a horrible experience.
5,Makes You question yourself.,THIS SERMON WILL MAKE YOU QUESTION YOUR LOVE FOR GOD AS YOU HERE THIS SERMON FROM TD JAKES STILL FRIENDS AFTER GOD SENDS YOU THROUGH TRIALS AND DOESN'T GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT ALL THE TIME DO YOU STILL LOVE HIM ARE YOU STILL FRIENDS WITH HIM. a VERY GOOD STRONG MESSAGE I RECOMMEND THIS MESSAGE TO ALL WHO CAN RELATE TO THIS.
5,Surprised and Happy With Still Friends,"I've always been a fan of TD Jakes. This DVD Still friends surprised me. At first I didn't want to watch it just because of the title. ""Friends"" I know, I'm the one who purchased the DVD but, at the time, because of situations, we go through mood swings. So I questioned why did I buy this DVD. But after watching it, I'm glad I did. There is a part in it where he speaks on when you know who your true friends are. Hit the spot for me. I've been spreading the message every since I received the DVD."
3,Not the author's best work.,"Helen Hooven Santmyer is one of my favorite authors. Although, ""The Fierce Dispute"" is not one of my favorites. The characters are beautifully written and are easy to visualize. However, the end of the book left me dissatisfied and wanting more. The plot is good, but it is just not as endearing as some of the author's other novels."
2,Banal and tedious,What a disappointment. Instead of the insightful observations Atwood is capable of -- and I have heard her speak -- this book is a mishmash of cutesy comments and esoteric references.
1,Boring and Depressing,Boring and depressing and really not much help to anyone who wants advice on the art of writing. More of a memoir and not much of one at that. And even the cover was poorly done - don't bother.
1,ugh.,"I got this book for a class on individualized writing and could not even finish it, which is a rare thing for me. I couldn't relate to it or see value in continuing. There's a chance that a decade later I might find more worth in it, but even the majority that I read did not make much of an impact on my memory."
4,Medical-Surgical Nursing: Clinical Management for Positive Outcomes,"As a nursing student, this was a required text book for my courses. The information contained is very in-depth and informative, but it is a very tough, and at times impossible read for those with limited or no previous medical background. The book comes either as one single book, or in two volumes. Ordering from Amazon.com, I was able to get it in the two- volume version, whereas my classmates are stuck carrying a 2500+ page book with them to their classes every day."
5,Medical-Surgical Nursing,I received this item as described. It was in mint condition with cellophane still wrapped around it. The price for this book and the free shipping was unbelievable. It would have cost me more some where else. The shipping was ridiculously quick. I want to thank Amazon for their wonderful service and making this transaction pleasant.
4,precise instruction for every handguner,"This book allows both the begining and experienced shooter to understand the basics of firearm operations, correct methods of shooting and most importantly firearms safety. A very good refresher for any avid firearms user, a must read for todays enthusiast!"
3,New NRA Guide to the Basics of Pistol Shooting May 2009,There is a new book published in May 2009 'NRA Guide to the Basics of Pistol Shooting'. The book shown in this review is the OLDER VERSION.Please contact a NRA Basic Pistol Instructor for the new version (ISBN): 978-0-935998-05-4. It involves a 10 hour class. The phone number to the NRA training division is: 703-267-1500.
2,For people who don't know ANYTHING about guns,This book explains the most basic principles about firearms. I got nothing out of this book that I didn' already know. For people who don't know their muzzle from their stock.
3,Very basic,"Covers all the basic information that is important in learnig to shoot a pistol. If you haven't read any other books on pistol shooting this would be helpful and quick, otherwise it may not have much new information."
3,Pistol Shooting Basics,"The book is somewhat dated,published in 1991, it covers a large amount of many different subjects as related to pistol shooting."
2,There are much better books out there.,"While this book has a very good price, it is very lean on actual knowledge. The first part of the book goes through the Swing components and does a decent job reviewing the main features of each. This reading is extremely dry but focused.It does include a discussion of the Swing delegate-UI model and some thoughts on MVC. A pleasant suprise, considering the javadoc nature of the book's reading.The second half (400 pages!) of the book is just plain worthless. The javadoc generated information that comes with the Swing APIs is more useful."
2,Not his best work,"This book has good code samples and covers a lot of Swing. Unfortunately instead of really covering all the detail of a very complex framework, the book stops halfway both figuratively and literally. Of the 806 pages, only 356 are really any use. The last half of the book is composed of poorly presented synopses of the packages. These 450 pages (except for a workable index) are a waste and should have been used to convey the detail missing in the first half. They contain no navigational aids; instead class and interface descriptions appear seemingly randomly according to obscure (to me)organizational principles.The book also lacks a stylistic or pattern-based overview; instead we are left to infer these from the code samples."
3,"Some good info, but poorly organized","The first part of the book, up to page 350, provides some good background on Swing plus some usable examples. The last half (pages 350 - 800) is close to useless. The reference provides no descriptions, not even one sentence, about each member. Classes are hard to find since the page header does not give you any indication of where you are. The index is one of the worst I have seen. This was the only book on Swing in my local bookstore when I needed one fast."
1,Not upto the reviews read so far for this book..,"I bought the book following the reviews and I found it to be a waste. I was looking for an advanced swing book and I landed in buying one that is very elementary. I expected this book to provide some advanced examples but I did not find one. This book is for beginner, and even a beginner will not need this book after a week or 2. The book is actually 356 pages and rest is just appendix which one can freely download from some site on the net. As an example hardly 2 pages are devoted to the JScrollPane, which actually needs a deep understanding. Buy this book and u will never touch it again. I do not know how some people gave a 5 * ranking to this book."
2,cheap for a reason,"I totally agree with the reviewers who gave this a low rating and wonder what [edit] people must have read to give this five stars.As for the so-called robust, real world examples, take listing 4.3 which:1) reports exceptions to stdout without doing anything else2) comments to ""take care of displaying frames so they don't overlap"" and then goes ahead and doesn't to that care, because it would be non-trivial to do so.3) doesn't even work. I spent an hour trying to figure why my code wasn't working, untill I compiled the code in the book and discovered it didn't either.As for the appendix, I'm pretty shocked at the waste of paper, as one sentence per method would have made it so good. It's much worse than the ""in a nutshell"" books, which give a description of the main methods in the opening paragraph. Could have been so much better. Even at this price you're paying way too much.I'm going to be very cautious before I ever buy a ""Pure xxx"" book again."
2,Don't pay for nothing :-/,"* This book is actually 350 pages long, the rest are greetings and badly formatted reprint of JDK documentation* Index takes almost 140 pages and is of no good use at all* No CD-ROM, so you should type in all examples by yourself* Typos in text + typos in listings of examples* It's hard to understand what he is talking about from his examples"
1,Dont buy this !,Dont waste your money and time. Dont buy this book. Just compilation of api. Its good we have 30 day return policies !
1,Give me my money back,"Fortunately this book was relatively cheap. Otherwise I'd be pretty upset. All kinds of typos, so right off the bat I got a bad feeling about it. But most of what I read was useless information. Didn't help at all. I'd give it 0 stars if possible."
5,Great book for kids who are into adventure,"I love the books that Chris Demarest writes. His pitures are beautiful, accurate and he includes details that really interest my 5 year old, who has loved this book since he was 3. A classic."
4,GREAT CD,"I fell in love with the song ""tomarrow"" when i first heard it on mtv a few days ago. i ran out to the store and got it and played it. i expected ""tomarrow"" to b the best song on the cd, but id have to say ""they all fall down"" was my favorite. after number 8 they started sounding the same though."
2,One of the worst follow-up CDs ever,"I don't know what happened to SR-71. Their first album was surprisingly good, with fun, catchy, and often intelligent lyrics. I guess SR-71 thought they weren't ""hard"" enough, or ""bad"" enough. Their new songs are boring; music and lyrics. Nothing what made the first album great exists here. The only decent and funny song is ""She was Dead"", which sounds similar to ""Fame"" from the first album."
4,Great CD,"I thought their first album ""Now you see inside"" would sound a lot like their hit single ""Right now"" but most of that cd was completely different, but yet very good, and now I thought ""Tommorrow"" would sound a lot like ""Now you see you inside"", but this album is completely different, but definitally not disappointing..A very good rock cd worth dropping money on..."
4,A Different Sound for SR-71,"I like SR-71 a lot. I love their first album; Now You See Inside has some really good writing (in addition to it's share of silly lines) and *great* harmonies. So I can't help but be slightly disappointed by Tomorrow. It's not that it's a bad album, but the guys sound different than they did on NYSI. Whereas that album featured mostly a pop-punkish sound, this album is more hard rock. The first time I heard Tomorrow, I was a little put off by the difference, but after a few more listens it has really grown on me; there really are some great tracks. I guess nothing can really match ""Go Away"" from Now You See Inside, but Tomorrow definitely is worth your time. I'm giving the album 4 stars, but it's probably more like 3 1/2."
1,You don't need to be a weatherman to know this CD blows,"Because their first CD was pretty good, I listened to ""Tomorrow"" several times to give it a chance. But it never got better - ""Tomorrow"" seems to drag on and on, with meandering, pointless melodies and whining vocals. My advice? Don't bother."
1,"horrible, get now you see inside instead","i'm more of a fan of the sugarcult, good charlotte, and sum 41 older stuff sound. if you are too, get now you see inside. that is a better overall album. this cd is horrible."
4,Very Good Book Combining Sports Betting and Computer Program,"I am a programmer as well as a sports bettor and this book is right up my alley. The book is very well written. He gives many sports handicapping programs in BASIC for baseball, football, basketball, horse racing and dog racing. Unfortunately, although the programs are written in BASIC, they are written in a version that is outdated on today's Visual Basic compilers. Unless you know Visual Basic down pat, you will not be able to use the programs. I liked the book a lot and wish Jasper could have written follow ups. But I am glad to have this one. His sports betting books are the best ones of the genre!"
3,Mathematics,"The course is brief and to the point but there are typographical errors that confuse what is being conveyed. (For instance, instead of a small 2 above and to the right of a number or variable there will be a large 2 to the right of the number or variable, so you don't know whether to square the number or multiply by 2, untill you can't arrive at the correct answer, then go back and do it the other way.) To me it made getting through the lessons a kind of perverted fun but I'm 69 and just running through the lessons as a review for my own personal pleasure but there are enough typos' and inconsistancies of various sorts that, for a student trying to learn this subject for the first time, these small errors may frustrate them to the point of giving up."
4,enjoy,"I got this CD for my son - one day in a store parking lot he started singing one song 'Lord, I want to be [a Christian] in my heart...' This CD is a blessing - Mr. Ortega is a wonderful artist and easy to listen to."
5,Fernando at His Best,"Fernando has the most soothing medatative voice I have ever heard and I am very glad his first album has been rereleased. Want his best work ever? This album is it. Every tune is incredible, moving, and captures Fernando at his best. I had to scour the internet for this out-of-print CD, but here it is again! Don't miss this one."
2,Old ingredients makes for a dull brew,"I had high hopes for an organic brew. I was at the hop addition stage and after snipping open the hop bag I was greeted with some old, not very fragrant hops. Turned out they were 2006 and not well stored. At that stage of the brew you have no choice but to use them if you don't happen to have a back up supply.Sadly I have 5 gallons of drinkable but bland beer. The response of Seven Bridges - sorry someone should have pulled the old hops from the kits! I am going to toss some leftover hops from a different batch into the keg and see if I can perk it up a tad.Moral here is to buy from suppliers that have higher turnover of the ingredients and check your ingredients carefully before the brew day."
4,Great kit!,"Bought this for my boyfriend who has been wanting to brew for a while. He's a 'semi-beginner', because he has read a lot on the process, knows the basics, visited breweries etc, just hadn't started on his own yet. He LOVES it & finds it easy and quick to do without being 'so beginner' that it's boring."
3,Great Recipes and information,"I really like this book and when I bought this book, I bought another M&P book. All I can say is I like the other one better. I like that there is a picture for each recipe but what seems to be lacking here is what fragrance to use at least on some of the recipes. I understand that some things should be left to the imagination but when it comes to recipes that I am trying to copy, I want to be exact and to kind of feel what she feels when the soap is used for the 1st time. There is no way I could make cake without knowing the full list of ingredients and I feel the same applies here. Overall this is a great book and a good read."
5,Melt & Mold Soap Crafting is inspirational,"My friend gave me some coldprocessed soap about 2 years ago and I wanted MORE homemade soap. The creative gene in me craved colors, molds, designs and simplicity.I found the melt & pour so easy. This is such a wonderfully addicting hobby. A+ for Kailas book. I now have a few friends who have also been inspired to join in the soap crafting after seeing her book. Each picture triggers another thought and the creativity just continues. Friends and family love getting the handmade soaps as gifts, especially kids. Thanks for the giggles and the bubbles Kaila."
4,Great little resource book,Fantastic little book that covers everything to you need to know about soap making (getting started)Lots of pictures and printed on quality paper. :)It was enough for me to make soaps this past sunday.. and they turned out great (see posted pics)
3,Split decision,"Good for former and current Marines and their friends and family. It's a bit of a recuiting film which leads to a lose of credibility. Otherwise, it shows a good deal of what we went through in training. There was an outright error in the film about women training. Women began training similiar to men's training by at least 1982 which is longer than 20 years ago."
3,"Lots of fluff and circle jerking, not very realistic","In reality, Rangers are the first to fight, they are the true spear and always will be. Airborne operations are what starts a war and the army are the last to leave a battlefield. Marines are good soldiers, but are they the best of the best? I'm sure there are recon marines that are better than berets and vice versa, they all have different jobs and different skill sets. But overall the army is the backbone of the military and is what gets the job done. I respect marines and what they do with the... What's a word for it? S***** equipment and weapons at their disposal( give this branch more funding!) but they are not the end all be all and they never will be(despite what they tell you or what you see on tv).Great documentary if you are a marine, not very realistic if you aren't."
5,Still Listening to Cliff Richard,"Discovered this super artist in the late 70s. I must have at least a dozen albums and at least 6 or more CDs including this one. Don't know what it is, but when I hear his voice well it is very special. Lot of people in the United States have never heard of him when I might talk to them about a song or say his name. He did have a few hits here that many people would recognize but would not know who is singing. I treasure my collection of his material that I did buy and held on to - mostly vinyl. I still enjoy listening to them. This album was always one of my favorites along with the one called ""Silver"" (not sure that was the original name - need to pull that out and listen to it soon). Thank goodness he is appreciated in Britain. To me, it was the emotion he could bring out in a song. At times, it might not have been a super song, but his interpretation of that song could bring such enjoyment and joy. Feel very fortunate that I discovered his music!"
4,A Wonderful Experience,"David Davidson's work is truly inspirational. His music lifts up my soul whenever I'm in a foul mood. His songs vary from slow and romantic to energetic and upbeat. His arrangements include other various instruments such as the drums and the guitar. My favorite piece of his album is the Doxology, which praises God in a whole different way. He has changed regular boring hymns into something much more creative and exciting!"
1,Main scene cut,Might be a bit sexist but I bought this mainly for the scene that shows Merediths breasts.IF this is why you want this DON'T BUY IT. The scene has been deleted from this version.
3,Kind of Disappointing,"This story was a little disappointing to me. Meredith Baxter was, as always wonderful as an actor, but her character was annoying. I didn't like any of the characters or the story at all. It was just missing something for me."
5,A must-have book for women who struggle with poor body-image,"This book really gets to the core of what body-image issues are all about: caring more about what other people say makes us beautiful as women, than what God says. I am a person who highlights and underlines and makes other markings in books as I read them, and there is hardly a page in ""Wanting to Be Her"" where I did not mark something that resonated with me. My hope is to start a women's discussion group about body image, using this book as a guide. I believe strongly, as the author does, that it is important that we wrestle with these issues in community, as we continue the journey to freedom from societal beauty standards. Thank you Michelle Graham for your honesty and vulnerability, and for calling a spade a spade. For another wonderful book about body-image, I highly recommend ""Who Calls Me Beautiful? Finding Our True Image in the Mirror of God"" by Regina Franklin."
2,hard to follow,"Shortened version: Don't buy this DVD unless you have an incredible memory.Long version: My daughter started playing the DVD and sat and waited, because the actual dancing part wasn't for a bit. When the actual dancing part happened, Paige showed us about 7 dance moves then said do it. Of course, my daughter couldn't keep up. Then she showed us a whole new set of steps then said do it. After my daughter attempted to keep up on the second part, Paige told us to put it all together and do both parts. And yet again, my daughter couldn't keep up. It was when my daughter was watching Paige ""demonstrate"" the moves before doing them that I realized that my daughter isn't getting much excersize out of the DVD. I WOULD NOT recommend this DVD to anyone, especially to little kids, who would definetly not keep up to Paige's high memory rate."
4,My 2 year old loves this video,"I bought this for my daughter just before she turned two because she loved to dance, but her dance moves consisted of jumping up and down. We've had this DVD for about three months now, and she watches it at least three days a week! While it is a long, complicated, fast paced routine, I wasn't expecting my 2 year old to be able to learn a routine anyway. However, my husband and I have noticed our daughter learning alot of the moves, and she even narrates along with Paige through out the video. Now when we are listening to the radio, she actually dances instead of just jumping up and down. I wouldn't really recommend this video for a kids workout program, unless they plan on doing it over and over again to learn the routine, but I think it is a great video to just dance around and have fun, and learn a few new moves here and there."
5,Another EXCEPTIONAL title in the Paige's Workout Party series!,EXCELLENT DVD!!!! My daughter and her friends LOVE the Paige's Workout Party DVDs. The dances in this DVD are so much fun for them...and they have performed the routines in their school talent shows. I have to admit that as a mom I enjoy dancing along too! What a great DVD and a great series!!!! *****************
2,Just like reading oracle on line help pages,Lacks conceptual explanation of portals in detail. Most of the content from this book can be read from product documentation that comes with Product. It would have been helpfull if material is focused on developing a full portal application and developing concepts around it than explaining the tool and its features.
1,Not very warm,"This heated toilet seat only reached 85 degrees in our 72 degree house. The human body is 98.6 and human skin is over 90 degrees. Therefore, it felt cold. We refunded ours."
2,Sorry I bought it,"The seat is nicely designed, but has one HUGE design flaw. The seat and lid together are thicker than most toilet seats/lids so when lifted together and leaned against the tank lid, it is not exactly vertical and the seat will not stay up. The toilet lid does. If all your users are female, this is not a problem. But my husband finds it particularly annoying and I don't blame him. This may not be a problem if the lid on the tank does not overlap the tank, but our lid projects out over the tank about an inch. I don't know what to do about this. I will call Kohler and see if they have a solution but I doubt it. Also, the heating element is advertised as heating to 20-30 deg. F above room temperature, but our bathroom is about 55 deg F in the early morning and a 75 deg F seat is not all that warm. I was disappointed that there is no way to increase the temperature. There are many heated toilet seats on the market. I wish I had thought more about the pros and cons of each one."
5,Pennywise at their peak,"THis is Pennywise at their best. My three favorite songs on this c.d. are It's what you do with it, every single day, and freebase. I have all of the Pennywise exept wildcard, Straight Ahead, and land of the free. The only complaint I have with this c.d. besides the number of songs {only twelve} is that nearer to the end of this album Pennywise get's a really dark kind-of angry felling to them. I am the only Punk at my school who listens to real PunkRock aka Pennywise and Bad Religion.This c.d. is what turned me into a huge Pennywise fan, if you don't want this one get live at the Key club or the self titled..."
4,BEST PW album,PERFECT PEOPLE and I WON'T HAVE IT are the best songs. less poppy than straight ahead but still accessible and with a good message.
5,Oh the sweet sounds...,Pennywise is a fast paced band that'll leave you wanting more. Their music echoes their Southern California roots with a lot of heavy guitar. You can almost feel yourself tearing up a wave on a shortboard or ripping down a mountain on your snowboard. Get it!!!!!
5,A Classic!!!,"I have listened to this album over and over and over. I just can't applaud enough what a great message this band has for the entire world. So positive and so thought-provoking. I wish people could get past the ""noise"" and hear the important messages being said lyrically. Bravo Pennywise! --Kelly Magovern"
5,A treat for Moths Fans,"While many great live bands suffer when they're forced to put their tracks down on tape, the Moths have succeeded in capturing the energy and subtle touch (even in their extreme rock n roll) they have so often displayed in their many masterful live performances. If you like rock and roll and have been wondering where it's been hiding for the past ten years, definitely check out this album. And if they play in your town, check out their live show as well."
5,FASCINATING BOOK,"LOVED THIS BOOK. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. AS A BEGINNING TREASURE HUNTER, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
4,"a good ""basic"" tips book for you to find tips for farther research","it listing a lot of tips 7500---however since it list so many tips--- needless to say it can only give a brief bit on each one----its a good starting point of ""local treasure stories /tales"" in your state & area that you then must go and do the ""leg work"" to flesh out the rest of the story. if you are a research based type hunter its a good starting point--- ""tips"" to get you started ---if you expect ---""well go the the corner of elm and jones street in zippytown,florida and walk seven feet east --dig five feet down and you'll be set for life ---well get real --if it was that easy the bookwriter would do it. good hunting to all."
1,Average,This book doesn't give you any detail on actual locations. Just vague stories. I wouldn't buy.
3,Looks like plastic,"I ordered one of these for my son's senior portraits to hand out as a gift. I don't believe these frames are real wood. Maybe composite wood at best. The frames almost look plastic, which is what I was trying to avoid. All the different black ""wood"" frames I purchased looked similarly plastic, so maybe that is the style, but it looks cheap to me."
3,It Depends......,"Blass and Neves are both correct. However, Peg is correct also. I have been ordering frames on Amazon to fill a hallway and I did order these frames. I ordered 5x7's and 8x10's. The 8x10's are exactly as Blass and Neves state in their reviews. I will not order them again. However, the 5x7's were a great frame with glass, back slide entry and well made. I will be ordering more of these.I suspect that Peg ordered 5x7's and Blass and Neves ordered 8x10's. Note that at the point of sale there are three sizes and several colors. At the time I thought it curious that the 8x10's were $10.49 and the 5x7's were $10.99. Now I know why."
1,junk,"pretty much the worst frame i've ever seen. poorly constructed and requires pliers to insert the picture. i would have returned it, but not worth the trouble"
1,Huge Waste of Money,"Okay, first of all, this picture frame took forever to finally ship and arrive. Of course after that I get it and I'm excited that I can finally give my friend her gift, but that was quickly ruined because all of the small metal tags that held the back in place broke off within five minutes. Besides, the back doesn't even fit in correctly and slides around, the part that is supposed to be used for standing it up doesn't work, at all, and the cheap plastic used for the picture cover is scratched up and dirty. This is probably the worst thing I have ever bought online. It would be a slap in the face to buy this as a gift for a friend."
4,Nice frame!,"Nice, well-made contemporary frame. Good price with free shipping offer, although I did find it cheaper at Kohl's."
4,Quality,I used these frames to frame my diplomas form College and Grad School. They fit perfectly and add an understated look to my important documents.
5,Awesome Wisconsin Patch,I received the patch very quickly and and it was exactly as the description said. I am extremely happy with my purchase.
4,Straight forward directory.,"If you are looking for a slick, glossy paged guide with pretty pictures, professional layout, and flowery descriptions, then this book is *not* for you. What you will get is a directory of hotels, B&Bs, museums, galleries, stores, restaurants, schools, etc. with notes from the author on each item. Some things, such as hotels, are grouped by cost and rating, others are not. It makes a good reference book."
4,Clever and imaginative.,"Michelle , Erin, and Billy seem like real kids to me. My brother thinks it is exciting, too."
2,Not very exciting,This book was not all that exciting. It could have been written better. Parts in it wasn't all of that. Most parts wasn't all that exciting. By Jarel
2,Soggy Popcorn!,"This popcorn popper has everything one would want, except no steam holes. There is no way for the steam to escape so the popcorn comes out soggy. I have drilled many holes through the top and still the steam collects up the sides. Not recommended if you don't like popcorn soggy."
3,Disappointing results,"I was so excited to get a new popcorn popper, after reading about the potential toxins present in microwave popcorn. The popcorn made by this popper, however, falls far short of the texture and flavor you get from microwave popcorn. The popcorn is consistently rather tough and soggy."
2,Sub-par popcorn maker,"Maybe I just wanted an air popper, but this does not seem to be the most efficient popper. An air popper was what I wanted, but this Cuisinart popcorn maker simply doesn't make it 'pop' enough, so the volume of the popcorn that is produced is not nearly as much as it would be with an air popper.The only good thing about it is that you just flip the unit over and the popcorn is served! Cleaning can also be quite an issue since there are several small parts and I wouldn't recommend fully submerging."
3,Cuisinart automatic popcorn maker,The first batch of popcorn is good and fluffy with little waste; however you have to wait until the machine cools down before making the second batch of popcorn. The machine will start to work on second batch and shut-off until machine is cooled. This is inconvenient when desiring lots of popcorn for making carmel corn.
2,Remanufacturred but not washed,"I expected ""remanufactured,"" but not still having the used popcorn oil in the bowl! I assume that the glitch that causes these to stop working has been fixed on this one, at least temporarily. We purchased this as a reasonably priced stopgap until we find something more reliable long-term -- except for having to put it through the dishwasher, so far, so good."
2,Traces of Heyer,"The meeting of hoyden and rake comes straight from Venetia (including the ""Cherry Red"" bit) the misunderstanding about the illegitimate children from yet another Heyer.The heroine was likable and not too 21st century. But actually I couldn't finish it -- the writing was too florid. A quick review of Strunk and White is in order here. Occasionally the description was effective, but much of it was drowned in overkill."
3,Relive an old PC adventure,I played Darkmoon in the late 80's early 90's. In the days of the first nintendo gaming system. Forgotten Realms contains the trilogy of Eye of the Beholder series. These games have a great story and hours of adventure. I advise any gamer to take notes because the labyrinth levels and the many puzzles are hard to remember. Search online for help. Other gamers have posted solves for all levels of the games. I found these solves very helpful! To date I haven't finished the third and final game but so far no bugs.I own a Mac machine. Mac owners must download a dos program to open these games. I used Boxer it worked fine with no bugs that I'm aware of in two years of playing. However it was a little tricky to work through the dos program in order to get the game to work on a Mac. The game did fully work! Another word of advise use a mouse with the keyboard.
4,From the ashes of Operation Ivy...,"With their first realese, RANCID creates a very exciting and emotinaly stimulating first LP. Starring two former members of the ska-punk quartet, Tim Armstrong (Lint) on guitars and vocals, and Matt (McCall) Freeman on bass and vocals, the pair add one of Tim's ex-roomates, Brett Reed on drums, and create a loud, not quite Hard-Core, all around great punk rock band. If you've seen Rancid on MTV or heard 'em on the radio, but you havne't heard this one, GET IT!! A true fan will have it, and you should too!!"
5,"Funny the best 2 rancid albums are Rancid, and Rancid!","its true my bretheren. rancid is the best there is. armstong and co.s first effort scremas talent and it screams loudly. another night, treches, rats in the hallway,my head, and hyeana are my personal favorites. this cd has built the fopundation for the sound that has made this group so sucessfull. chack out their S/T 2000 as well~! -miller"
3,this cd is ok,"i was first introduced to rancid through their music on ...And Out Come The Wolves, and Life Wont Wait, so naturally i was expecting something relly impressive from this album. but to tell you the truth, i was slightly dissapointed. the lyrics were not nearly as creative as op ivy's or rancid's later stuff. the guitar and bass lines were also not as impressive as i expected. tim and matt are very talented musicians, but this was just to early in their career to show it. the addition of lars and brett, to the matt and tim duo makes for an impressive sound,but unless you are really into rough hardcore punk, i recomend you stay away from this album."
5,Awesome,This Band is the best punk rock band ever!! There's nothing much to say about this amazing disc!!!! Ok there's one thing BUY IT!!
4,Classic Punk,"Although I never really got into this album, it certainly does deserve my upmost respect. I think that Rancid is a better band now that Lars is recording with them, but that's not to say their first effort wasn't any good. I just like them better now. This is a must for any fan of punk rock, and if you like their later stuff, particularly their latest album (Rancid, 2000) then you'll like this one too."
3,decent first album,"rancid is one of the greatest punk rock bands of this generation and redefine themselves with every album. this is the album that started it all, and while not near as accomplished at their following works it does hold its own as a fairly solid debut. as heard in tracks like ""hyena"" and ""rats in the hallway"" the trademark rancid hooks and shout along choruses are present, but overall album is somewhat rough around the edges and also notably lacks the presence of lars frederikssen. i am also withholding stars because of the prominence of bassist matt freeman's lead vocals. His lead vocals are damaging to an otherwise solid debut record. as an introduction to rancid though, i would more recommend ""Let's Go"" or the punk rock masterpiece ""...And Out Come The Wolves""."
2,Luckily they got better,"This is my least favorite Rancid albulm. I guess it is a little to harsh for my liking, and not enough upbeat rythms. If you like old school punk, I think you would enjoy this cd. However, if you like punk more mixed with ska or reggae, by thier later albums."
3,meh,"While one of the few/only Burmese-English dictionaries available, this is merely a photo-reprint of Judson's Burmese-English dictionary from the 1800s.Yes, a disclaimer is included at the beginning of the printed version, clearly stating that being published prior to 1923 has made it public domain and that there is potential for much of the material to be blurry or unclear, however, there is little to no mention of this in the online product profile.Really, the product is great to have (as a copy of the old dictionary) and is still valuable, but could've used a little bit of a modernization by typesetting in clear modern fonting and may be somewhat difficult to use for those not as familiar with Burmese and hoping to have clear text to refer to."
3,too intricate for toddlers,"My daughter loves stamps and she loves markers. I thought these would be great. But these require you to apply firm, even pressure and my 3-year-old can't do that, so she gets discouraged. When she gets older, I think she'll enjoy them more."
2,Dry,These markers are fairly dry. I don't expect them to last beyond a few uses. The stamper don't stamp completely well either.
2,Kids got bored with them,I bought these for my 3 & 5 year olds and they got bored with them after about 10 minutes. No big deal. Quality is good and what you would expect from Crayola.
4,A mystery worth reading,"I really liked this story, as it's so rare to be completely in the dark throughout a mystery. Usually you can feel yourself being led in one direction or another, hints are given so obviously that you have to suspend your disblief AND ignore the hints to stay with the story.The techno-speak and detailed insurance information was a tad on the tiring side, but not too bad.I really enjoyed the read and will certainly look for more from this author."
1,a dud,"I liked the two other Dooling books I read, but this one is a dud. The characters are repellent, the plot boring, and the ""mystery"" uninteresting. The scenes stretch on seemingly forever. There is an excessive and tiresome amount of insurance-industry and computer-programming detail. Forget this one."
2,Kind of a dud,"Yeah, it's hard to get really wrapped up in insurance fraud, despite the pretty decent writing... the religious stuff is interesting, and there's a couple of REALLY killer scenes at the end of the book (the one with Don, the contract and the cell phone is awesome!)..."
1,slow and convoluted,"Granted, making insurance seem interesting or even exciting takes special skills but this book makes you force yourself to pay attention. Not a good thing. There is nothing particularly interesting about the protagonist Carver Hartnett who pines after his co-worker Miranda for too many pages.When Lenny, a co-worker of Carver and Miranda who has some risky personal habits, dies under mysterious circumstances, Carver sets to find out what happened. Despite's Dooling's attempts to create witty banter among the friends, I just didn't care enough to know what happened to Lenny who had no apparent traits to justify Carver and Miranda's loyalty to him. In addition, Carver doesn't come off as very bright in many of his actions. It's hard to sympathize with such a character.Plodding dialogue with occasional religious references also slow the story down. I can't recommend this one."
2,perhaps the worst novel by one of today's best writers,"Many of the people purchasing this book at this stage in its cycle are fans of Dooling's previous novels, and like myself, would probably buy the book regardless of what reviews they might read. Until Bet Your Life, I couldn't imagine myself being disappointed by a Richard Dooling book.Dooling's carefully-calibrated nastiness is there (albeit all too infrequently), but the plot limps along, and the characters - with one notable exception that I pray points to a spin-off - tend to merge into one not particularly interesting entity. There just don't seem to be enough ideas to sustain the book as a novel of this length.For anyone not already acquainted with Dooling: ""Critical Care"" and ""White Man's Grave"" are two books that are difficult to top."
2,Dull... Stephen King and NYT are wrong,"Stephen King loved this book. I didn't.While he tries to imbue the insurance and viatical industries with intrigue and give Omaha Nebraska a noir-ish danger, they just don't fit. Add to that flying sledgehammer tech talk and oenophilist rants. The result is a lot of puffed-up scenes in a book that doesn't really satisfy. There's too much pulp and not enough brain, too much expected or at least predictable plotting, and the industry and city that provide the background for the book just refuse to play ball."
4,Great story!,"This book was a very interesting story, although it was short and not very in-depth. The photos were a good addition, and it was different from the Jews' perspectives. Instead of being sent to concentration camps during the war, she secretly fought for the Jews, leading them to the countryside to escape Nazi persecution. This different angle (coming from a resistance worker) made this story a good change from other WWII books."
2,Travel has nothing to do with it,"I bought this because I am interested in the problem of travel before the days of the highway patrol. When leaving the safety of a walled city and its environs a person took their life into their hands - and often lost it.This book should be titled ""Everyday life of Medieval People"". Travel has VERY little to do with the book and certainly didn't address any of my interests."
5,LOVE this DVD!!,"I just bought this DVD for my best friends birthday and she loves it! We are both very big fans of the Wedding Peach series! It is very charming, neat, and cute! It is one of our favorite animes and mangas!"
3,An interesting look back into TVs history,"Over 18 hours on 5 DVDs -- 1-2 episodes each of Lassie, The Life of Riley, You Bet Your Life, I Married Joan, Combat, Sea Hunt, Mannix, Burke's Law, Dragnet, Wagon Train, Mr. Ed, Fury, The Cisco Kid, Peter Gunn, The Danny Thomas Show, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Medic, Checkmate, Petticoat Junction, Adventures of Robin Hood, Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Sky King and Racket Squad.Quality varies, but that's part of the nostalgia! It's amazing that television actually caught on considering how truly AWFUL some of these shows were! But if you're ""of an age"" to remember them, you'll get a kick out of the trip down memory lane, and you'll probably appreciate today's television more (as bad as it usually is!).In a few of the episodes, the commercials are shown as well and they're almost as entertaining as the shows!"
5,My holy grail hair gel,"This firm-hold gel is completely water soluble and has a nice crunch factor that softens easily when it's dry. It's inexpensive, so I can use as much of it as I need to produce smooth, glossy ringlets. It holds up to Oklahoma wind and humidity without drying my hair out. Great product at a fantastic price."
5,A Good Book,"Frances and Friends is about a girl named Frances McAllister who lives in Wisconsin. She has two good friends named Polly and Lena. And then everything changes.Amanda moves to town from Los Angeles. Her father is a screenwriter. Amanda and Polly become good friends, and Frances feels left out because Polly is her best friend and they usually do everything together.To see if Frances and Polly become best friends, read Frances and Friends!"
3,why the creepy music?,"Okay, the information in this is very interesting. But why is the music so creepy? I mean come on! I'm trying to watch this with my spouse, we were all excited about thinking about a cute baby, but the music frequently (but thankfully not always) sounds like something out of a ""History"" Channel-style alien freak show. And then there are the constant scenes of babies left alone in dark rooms or dark stages, and wires strapped to their heads. Sure, it's science, but couldn't there be a less creepy way to present this?"
3,Philippa Foot. Natural Goodness,"It has not yet arrived, but I'm sure I'll value it. It's been highly recommended by people I respect and has its place in a philosophical tradition I follow."
2,disappointing,"The tight, hard reasoning that Foot was once known foris gone, and its place has been taken by ethical wishfulthinking. There's good work in this tradition -- MichaelThompson's ""Representation of Life,"" for instance -- and I'dgo there instead."
1,Not to sure,"I'm not to sure about this cable.The moment I connected it, it shutdown my computer instantly.Running windows 7 with WD 500GB.Have to retry later."
1,Waste Money On An Extra Cable,"The product that I had purchased came with a ATA external cable, and that I did not need to purchase a second cable as suggested by amazon.com. Now I own one extra cable that I have no use of!"
5,Good quality = less headache,"The SIIG serial cables might be a little more expensive than the generic cables but well worth it.These are also not as flexabile as the cheaper cables, which I now learned the hard way that they should be.The SIIG's have moved at least 20 terabytes these last few months and have yet to find errors after verification.I now also use then to verify if the external HDD has any errors and utility work.Do your self a favor and bypass lower quality cables.I saved a few bucks and lost gigs of data due to coruption and problematic connection issues with lower quality generic cables.Trouble shooting is imposible with bad cabels.Works fine with a 1 TB Western Digital and Segates, as long as the external and SATA HDW has decent BIOS."
2,Generic substitution made without notification,"Note: These comments apply only to RedTag Town, not to the SiiG cable which I did not receive. It was a simple order: a SiiG 3.3 ft eSATA cable (CB-SA0111-S1). This particular cable was ordered because Seagate certified it as one tested in-house for use with my FreeAgent drive. The cable I received was a generic one made by Keen Top, with no mention of the substitution. Everything would have been fine if it had worked, but it didn't. (Confirmed by testing it vs another eSATA cable that I had.) I do not blame Red Tag Town for the defective cable, but I do blame them for sending a product other than the one that I ordered with no mention even made about the substitution. They did, however, apologize, admit the substitution, and promptly refund my money."
5,works at a good price,Good value for the price works with Acomdata Puredrive connected to a Scientific Atlanta 8300 HD.
4,cheap cable that works,"I haven't had the cable that long- only about 3 weeks, but it's been fine so far. The only complaint I have is that the cord is not very flexible. This is particularly apparent in trying to twist the ends to fit into eSATA ports."
5,Works great,"As recommended on tivo community forum, I got this to connect my Western Digital DVR Expander to my Tivo HD device. The cable fits very snugly and better than the Western Digital supplied eSata cable."
1,Does anyone here really sell the SIIG cable?,"Got cheap replacement cable... the 3rd party sellers here don't seem to know that the SIIG cable is important to the usage of Tivo's external disc drive.As far as they are concerned, any old eSata cable is as good as another."
5,good cable for the money,I purchased this cable for connecting a 1.5 TB WD external hard drive that was conneted via USB 2.0. It works as expected with data transfer rates exponentially better than before. Cable is a bit stiff so fitting it into a tight space could be a challenge but careful manipulation allowed it to go where required.
5,Beyond Selling Value,"I have read a lot of sales books and have attended more than my share of sales training seminars. Seldom have I seen content that is clearly written by sales people, for sales people. The anecdotal information brings to life behaviors that are ""how to"" steps rather than ""one should always"" general recommendations... real examples rather that philosophies about what should work. This tactical approach sets Beyond Selling Value apart and answers a lot of tough questions where others have failed to go."
2,Mrs. Witty's Monster Cookies,"I was totally dissappointed when my book arrived. The seller deceived me by saying that it was a hardcover book. It was not. Please seller on your description tell us the truth, we trust on what you put on the website."
2,Not impressed,I received the rod case with the bottom broken during shipment. Got a new replacement from Plano with just a phone call very easy and free. Rod case was too large once rods were inside much larger than I could handle in a small car.
3,What is pictured is not what you get!,"The item sent is not the same design as indicated in the picture. The picture indicates a side opening cover, which is what I wanted.What I received was a pop-top design that I personally don't like as well.That said, it does provide excellent protection for air travel."
5,A Heart Pounding Thriller,"I read the book Takedown by Joyce Sweeney. It is about a kid named Joe and his sister Elizabeth. They are having a big party to watch wrestling when it takes a turn for the worst. Throughout the story Joe, his sister, and all of their friends have to fight through there nail biting situation.I don't really like to read that much but Takedown was an awesome book. It is the first book that I've given five stars all year, And I read it in about a week and a half. One thing I liked about it was it was really exciting. I found myself reading in between periods and even on weekends. It kept me on the edge of my seat and I couldn't wait to turn the page. I don't think there was really anything that I didn't like about it.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes an action packed spine chilling story. Once you start reading Takedown it will suck you in and you won't be able to stop. Both guys and girls could read this book and I hope that they will!"
5,what a great book it makes you feel so much better,As women most of us feel that if somthing goes wrong on the date it was our fault this book makes dating seem so much more fun and easy and takes the stupid what ifs and crap out of it dating shouldnt be complicated in the first place i would recommend this book to anyone going through a recent break up i broke up with my boyfriend of 4 years 6 months before our wedding and this book helped me realize that getting back in the dating world doesnt have to be complicated so what if a date doesnt go exactly as you wanted eventually one will!
4,This has become a classic,"This selection of songs has become a classic. Each song tells a story of some moment surrounding the birth of Christ - from the perspective of Mary, from the perspective of the Inn Keeper from the perspective of Friedrich Handel and from a modern period of time.Anyone of any denomination who wants to bring more of the Christ story into their Christmas will enjoy this CD."
4,From the Shadows,"The 43 Light Street series continues with ""From the Shadows."" Security expert Alex Shane faces a strange case when his client disappears. Is it murder or has his client faked his disappearance? The investigation leads him to Sara Delaney, a young woman he had an encounter with when they were in high school. She makes him feel things he hasn't for years, but can she be trusted?""From the Shadows"" is an unusual and unique Intrigue story. Readers eager for something different will find it here. An interesting puzzle with constant action and good twists, ""From the Shadows"" should keep readers guessing. Although Sara often seems stranded on the sidelines during this story, more of a supporting character than a heroine, and the romance is slight, Rebecca York has a fresh, intriguing story to tell."
4,Excellent,This is a great book. I wrote a review of this book before that someone didn't like. But let me get to the point. Mr. Johnson teaches his philosophy about the martial arts that can be very helpful to martial artists and nonmarttial artists.
4,"OK, but not my girl's most favorite oneb","Just similar as other Diego, my 2 years old girl is a big Diego fan. I bought several Diego for her, but this one is not as lovealbe as other 3. She seldom picked this one to watcje."
3,shop around,I'd prefer bigger bubbles and slightly smaller gripthought they'd be a bit for visually exciting in person.solid quality product. packed and shipped perfect. perhaps I should have got the tall balls
2,Not brown....amber,"These glasses are not brown - don't let the title fool you---they are amber; like every other amber glass out there. I have been (and still am...) looking for brown glass (I don't want opaque or ceramic brown, I want a normal glass, just colored brown). It seems to be that those don't exist though, ""brownish"" colored glass really only comes in amber. I didn't want amber....Further, the glasses are oddly shaped. They are the shape of the picture, but the rims of each glass are cockeyed; they are not symmetrical. It's ok, but just something to keep in mind.On a positive note - they are very durable and thick, they have held up to wear and tear."
5,Old Horse face here looking at ya!,"Perfect match for my Lecruex dish set in Cassa purple. These glasses are extreme quality. Nice color of course, and the bubbles are just right, not blatant nor obnoxious, that is , how do you say in your language, a five hoof stomp on the barn floor and no long face. That is not happy horse! These glasses are built like Panzers. I would break from the stress of the barn before these do. They came well packed no chance of breaking at all. I orderd via Amazon as always for the free 7 day shipping but did get them in four days as usuall with Amazon at times. If you like Cassa color, get them-they are truly what others have said-great and the price is very fair for four of these, trust my horse sense on that!"
3,Hard to rate,It does make me feel a little more comfortable when storing gas for long periods. I use it for my generator fuel but do cycle it into my car after 4-6 months of storage.
3,A Good Place To Start,"I have to say that I had high hopes for this book. However, once I received it, I was dissappointed. Everything that is in this book can be found on the Internet.While this book does provide a lot of information, if you have researched Affiliate Selling at all...anywhere else...you probably already know what's in this book.Having said that, if you are looking for a place to start to learn about Affiliate Selling, this may be it. This book is written for the person who knows absolutlely nothing about Affiliate Selling. It goes over places to sign up with and defines what Affiliate Selling is."
1,"Selling What? Definitely a pre ""dot-bomb"" book!","There are better books out there. This covers all the same basics that everyone else has, but there is nothing special here. Who are these ""pioneering experts in the field"" (quote from the back cover) who are unheard of in the Affiliate Manager community? Note that both of their companies (and affiliate programs) are dot-gone. Can you trust authors who actually think (no offense Mr. Bezos) that Amazon.com created this idea, when there are documented examples of programs running years before? Just examples of gross issues that detract from the ""expert"" value I need in an author before I will accept them as credible.Dan Gray's book is a bit dated, but is better, and Shawn Collins' book gives a great perspective. Shawn is still managing one of the best run programs out there. Buy either of these books first."
2,"Better than the others, but that doesn't say much.","The Helmstetter and Metivier book is better than most of the other titles in this category, but the category doesn't have any good books overall, so that's a pretty lukewarm recommendation. I can't characterize this book as a ""must have"" and find it fairly incredible that some other readers give it such high marks.If you want to get up to speed quickly in affiliate marketing and affiliate programs, this is a good place to start. But you can skim this book in a few hours to getwhat you need. Then its off to the Internet to get the latest information. In about two years, this book will be quite dated.I think the authors are correct in their enthusiasm for affiliate marketing in general, but their treatment is superficial cheerleading. The mechanics of an affiliate program are pretty straightforward. It's the marketing that's difficult and they offer no insights here other than warmed over cliches."
3,The Saga Begins,"This is where it all starts, Goku's Journey. Over all I'ld have to say this is the weakest of the first Dragonball set, the other being Dragonball Z. Toriyama hasn't figured out the characters. This is no villain, just miss understood persons (ie Yamcha and Oolong). We don't even meet Pilaf until the next book, the main villain of the first journey. The stories are fun, filled with mostly camp and cheesyness, but they don't have the page turning action of the later books."
2,it's just ok...,"This is like a real quick over view of things. I did not think it was worth the price. Like I said it wasnt bad, but youre not going to pass the Nationals with it or become an expert after watching it."
5,Wounded by Love,"The book arrrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. I began reading it the same day. But then, I had to stop and meditate on what I had just read. It was very deep, very beautiful, and I know I will enjoy the rest of it."
3,Somersize Desserts,"I have been Somersizing since January of this year, and have seen incredible results. I bought all three of Suzanne's books and would recommened them to you all. The recipes are easy and clear and are delicious and satisfying. The desserts are sinfully wonderful. The best part is knowing you can eat them and still lose the weight.I therefore was excited to hear of this new book, just filled with desserts, yet after looking through the book I was left disappointed. Some of the recipes you can not substitute her Somersweet product with saccharin, which could be a problem if you can not afford to buy Somersweet. There are not many Level One desserts, unless you enjoy her cheesecake, which she gives two new variations.I understand that to make a dessert fit into the Somersize program can be difficult, but compared to her other projects I feel this one falls short.I would though recommend this book to all who Somersize or those who are trying to maintain their weight."
2,Nothing beats the real thing- sugar,"First let me say, that I love all of Suzanne's cookbooks. I have lost all of my baby weight (36 pounds) in 3 months! Her food plan is the best. I bought this book in hopes that I could bring sweets back into my diet without cheating on my diet.The recipes are ""ok""- which this pains me to say as all of her other recipes are out of this world delicious! The Somersweet product doesn't compare to sugar. I recommend passing on this cookbook. Once you lose the weight, you can incorporate small amounts of sweets into your diet. I have found that I don't want to do anything to gain the weight back- so even ""real"" desserts aren't worth it."
4,Great with a little help.,I have tried a couple of desserts and they worked great. I used Splenda as sweetner with no problem. I also substituted lower fat dairy products. I love this book.
2,"Okay, but not grand.","First off, if you use Somersweet in any of the frozen desserts, you get a rock hard, nasty tasting concotion. It doesn't freeze well at all.It also has a strange aftertaste that isn't natural at all.This being a review on her book and not the Somersweet though I have to say, for the recipies that don't require Sommersweet OR if you sub your own preferred substitute, (I love Wheylow) there are some fabulous ideas to work with.I really like the way the recipes are layed out in the book and the color photographs are beautiful. Something to aspire to. I love the Way Of Eating and I am greatful for all that Suzanne has put out in the market, I just don't think all of it is that great.This book is good, but small. I have used it, but I could live w/o it."
2,Disappointed,I didn't even keep this book for a month. Bear in mind that you have to have Suzanne's cooking products to make these desserts making them very costly to make and not convenient at all.
5,Delicious,This is a lovely way to lose weight or maintain a given weight. Arrived fast and in good condition.
5,"Excellent all-around fitness for us ""Pregos""","I loved this tape! I thought this was an excellent workout. I've used three other pregnancy exercise videos and found this one to be the best. The energizer, 3 aerobic sessions, toner and cool down provided me with a great work out session each day. The interviews with the OBGYN were informative and reassuring. The post-natal stretches and workout were great as well and made me feel like I was already getting back in shape in as little as one day after delivery."
1,"If you can't dance, this is NOT a good beginer arrobics vide",If you can't be tought to do dances like the electric slide because you just are not coordinated enough... if you tand to step on your husbands feet when you dance with him... then this is WAY to complicated for you. Don't believe reviews saying this is a good beginer arrobics video. If you are a realy beginer the compicated dance like moves will leave you standing in your living room scratching your head wondering when you signed up to audition to be a back up dnacer for a Janet Jackson music video. I totally regret this purchase.
2,Cheezy and Outdated,"I knew this would be an old video when I ordered it-but I wasn't prepared for just how outdated it really is. I rarely used this during my pregnancy and actually got shin splints from doing the aerobic portion. I did an ""outdated"" BBC exercise video when I lived in Europe and thought it was leaps and bounds better than this one. Don't waste your money."
2,Meh.,"The workouts are okaaayyy (and I do appreciate the fact they're segmented), but it is clearly for those who are new to exercising. If you're just starting to work out, this will be a great DVD. If you've been exercising prior to getting pregnant, this DVD will bore you."
2,VCR Copy,"I think my title says enough. May have been a good workout back in 1990 on VCR, but it's 2002. Buyer beware of DVD's that are just copies of VCR tapes...."
1,"Once I was side stepping and clapping, I knew it was over!!","This was the most cheesy workout DVD I have ever encountered! Unless you are a die hard 80's fan that still wears leg warmers and camel toe leotards, don't get this DVD! I was clapping and side stepping, trying to keep up with the work out. The music was terrible and to be honest, I didn't even break a sweat for the ten minutes that I worked out to it--that's how long I gave it a chance before I turned it off and never returned to it EVER again!"
2,outdated!,"I knew this was an 80's video when I bought it but did not predict how dumb I would feel dancing to the music and watching the cheesy, fakeness of the ladies in it. There is even a rap song they do together that they want you to sing a long with them in order to evaluate whether or not you are too out of breath or not! The whole thing is just so dorky.Also, the music is far too loud in comparison to the instructors voice. At times it is worse than others, almost like her microphone gets obstructed temporarily and you just can't hear her instruction."
4,Excellent and safe pregnancy workout,"There are not very many pregancy workout videos out there, but I have to say for the few there are, this is one to get. Yes, the rap routinue in the middle is annoying (just fast-forward through it), but the workout felt as challenging as any of the other tapes I used before pregnancy and was safe. She also provides a lot of information regarding pregnancy that was helpful."
5,Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout,"When I wanted to lose weight after college, I turned to Kathy Smith and lost weight. When I became pregnant, I turned to Kathy again. Her pregnancy workout helped me feel energetic and shapely through three pregnancies. Pregnancy can be a difficult time for some women. This video kept my self-esteem high as my body changed. After her workout, which is easy to follow and at just the right level of exertion, I always felt great! And, her video helped me bounce right back after childbirth. I highly recommend this video."
4,good workout!,"If you can get past the ""mushy"" teddy bear theme, which can get annoying, this really is a decent workout. I am an avid exerciser and in pretty decent shape, and this tape makes me feel like I'm still working out while pregnant. I also use Buns of Steel pregnancy workout and it's pretty good as well."
2,80's aerobic workout,"I bought this dvd, along with Jennifer Gianni's pilates fusion for pregnancy and what a difference! The Kathy Smith program takes you right back in time to the 80's. The background music has a definite ""Miami Vice/Casio tone"" feel to it, as do the outfits, and the set. The aerobic excerises do get your heartrate up, but this is not a very intense workout, at least not for someone who is already is pretty good shape. I found the rap sing-along portion of the tape to be really annoying, and the teddy bear icons which occasionally pop up are cheesy too. Overall, I would recommend this tape if you live in an area where you can't go for a brisk walk or swim or do some other aerobic workout to get your heart pumping. I will occasionally follow the workout during my pregancy, but I much prefer the Gianni pilates workout to this one."
5,Simply perfect for expecting mamas :),"So far, this is the best I've found. It's mild, but effective. I kept it part of my daily routine until the last 2nd week of my pregnancy. My labour only took two hours and I didn't really suffer much from it -- I think Kathy has truly been a great help! Thank you ever so much, Kathy!! ^..^ grateful ~"
2,Kathy Smith - Pregnancy Workout,"I am a big fan of Kathy Smith but this video is quite outdated -- I don't know the date but guessing late '80s. The workout is fine but wish I bought something more up to date since so much about pregnancy fitness has changed in the last 10 years. In the middle of the workout, there is an unnecessary pause where Kathy and the others in the video stop to perform a rap song...awfully silly and waste of precious time!"
2,Cheesy - that's the word I was looking for!,"I bought this & the Buns of Steel tape at the same time when I was 4 months & I rarely watch this one - I'm now 7 months & I think I've done the aerobic part of this tape twice. The moves are not as crisp or something - a little too pop music dance-y for me - made me want to put on my lace gloves with the fingers missing, lots of bangles & a big lace bow in my hair, like Madonna a la Lucky Star. There's a lot going on in the background & there are a lot of women doing the work out too, some a little annoying & distracting. I do like the specific toning areas of the tape - I often do the Buns of Steel workout & follow up with some of the workouts from the toning section of this tape. And the little bubbles that have Kathy giving info about the purpose of the moves or how to perform them correctly is helpful, but not enough to make me want to do this tape."
2,Skip this unless you are an exercise neophyte.,"This was so utterly disappointing. I was afraid of this, being made in the 80's and all. It lived up to all my low expectations. The exercises are like something uncoordinated 1st graders would do. Not to mention these ladies look like a bunch of untalented 6 year olds doing this dorky routine. If you are trying to maintain muscle tone with this you can forget it. Now if you have never exercised, this is probably ok to start with.I had been doing Tae Bo previous to becoming pregnant and am naturally comparing this video to it. I realize a pregnancy workout should be low impact, but this is ridiculous. I guess it's back to modified Tae Bo without the kicks."
2,Boring!,"So sorry folks but I have to disagree with the majority here. I found this tape to be low energy, non-motivating and plain boring! Perhaps it was because all I really wanted to do when I was pregnant was eat and sleep.... but this is how I felt about this tape.Guess I needed more inspiring music (Rocky theme would have worked), high-energy, fun and funky moves to make me forget how tired and sick I felt! This tape just didn't do that!"
2,good for a few laughs,First of all this video is so basic you would get a better workout just going for a walk. And the 1980's unitards are not really what i want to see pregnant women or any women for that matter wearing. It is good for a few laughs but that is about it. Why aren't there any good pregnancy workout videos? I gave this a 2 star just because at least they tried to make a pregnancy workout video.
1,Corny!,"This video is so corny and obviously made in the 80's. The audio quality is horrible, and it is difficult to hear Kathy Smith's voice over the loud, outdated music. There is a portion in this tape when all the women get together with sunglasses and backward hats and sing the most ridiculous song. That's when you have to fast forward the tape, especially, if you are in the throws of morning sickness. Just skip this one altogether. I did not even feel it gave me a good workout. I consider myself in pretty good shape, jogging, doing pilates and yoga pre-pregnancy. Go for Shiva Rea's tape or the Crunch Yoga Mama."
3,incorrect date of video,"hopefully it's a honest mistake, but how would you miss exact date of video? should have been ""1989"" not ""1993""."
1,Horrible,I am 4 1/2 months pregnant. I bought this DVD for those days when I am unable to go to the gym. I was totally dissapointed. I found this DVD silly and useless and I was petrified my husband would walk in and laugh himself silly at what i was doing.
5,My favorite preggers workout!,"I bought three pregnancy workouts: 1. Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout 2. Leisa Hart's Fit Mama 3. The Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 1.I have done all three and by far my favorite is Kathy Smith: Pregnancy Workout. It offers about 20 minutes of cardio, 15 mins of weight training, 5 min cooldown, and a relaxation/lamaze section. Of the three dvds it's the only one that really raised my heart rate and got me sweating a little bit, so I actually felt like I got a decent workout. Do be warned that its very 1980's, but if you can laugh at that, you will really benefit from the workout!"
4,A Superb all-round DVD,"This DVD is suitable for mums-to-be at all fitness levels. You just modify the workout to suit your fitness level by taking out arm movements if you get too tired, and working a little harder if you need a bit of a challenge.I really like Kathy Smith and have been doing a workouts for a while now. She's got an easy-going and fun style and her instructions are clear and easy to follow. The video also provides you with exercises that you can do following your delivery. Defintely a good buy!"
3,Pretty good,"I think this tape is pretty good. It gives you an all over workout and safty pointers so you dont over do it. I think the goofy blocks and bears are a little much, and I take time to get a drink during the Preggo Shuffle (a really bad rap song for testing your intensity level). But over all I fell like I get a work out, my heartrate gets to the level it is supposed to be at, and its keeping my shape good (in my legs, anyways!). Before my pregnancy I worked out 6 days a week for about an hour a day, so it's not quite what Im used to, but thats why its a pregnancy video. I like the Buns of Steele pregnancy workout a little better, its alot like this one but not goofy, I switch back and fourth between the two."
4,Cured my leg cramps!,"I thought calf muscle stretching was all I needed to alleviate nighttime leg cramps, but I noticed within a week of getting this video that my leg cramps were completely cured, thanks to the calf-raises in the toning section. When had sinusitis for a week or so, and stopped exercising altogether, the cramps came back. After I started doing the video again, the cramps disappeared again. So for me, this video has helped me get a better night's sleep.I love the aerobics (alot of arm work and you'll definitely break a light sweat), but as I get further along (almost 36weeks now) I find the fast-paced grapevine move and the 4-step across the room tougher to do. I thought rapid changes in direction were not advised in pregnancy? Also, the prego shuffle rap is so bad, embarassing, and useless that it's not worth a mention. Oh well...still an excellent video, includes women of many shapes and sizes, and a good choice for intermediate/advanced exercisers."
1,"lacks safety for all prego moms, toooo old, info outdated","i tried this video because Kathy Smith has so many good videos, but I do not trust the info that is presented. it seems as though medicine and fitness has improved in the past 15 years, and this is some old retro video that should not still be sold. I like Kathy, but I do not like the old clothing, overly dancy moves that are so bouncy, and I can't stand the atmosphere of this workout. I would much rather do Leisa Hart's FitMama video, it's new and safe. But then again, this is the internet, and we all can differ in opinion!"
3,Vintage Kathy,"It's a bit dated (especially that painful-to-watch prego shuffle), and the demographic of her fellow aerobicizers is surprisingly nondiverse, but it's a well-rounded workout that includes the all-important kegels and a nice cool-down/meditation that I look forward to."
5,A great pregnancy workout,"A wonderful tape for pregnant women who want to stay in shape and be safe at the same time. Smith puts a heavy emphasis on safety here - heart rate checks, reminders to remain hydrated, posture checks and modifications appear throughout. As a pretty conscientious exerciser, I wondered if this workout would leave me feeling like I hadn't worked out at all. However, the level is just right and again, modifications to raise intensity are suggested if you are feeling particularly energetic. Sections before and after the workout section are informative and reassuring. I plan on using this tape after I deliver my twins to get back into shape."
4,Good all-around workout,"For us fitness-minded women, it's easy to forget that we're actually trying to GAIN weight during this time in our lives. No, the Kathy Smith pregnancy workout is not especially challenging, and I won't use it once I can go back to my speed workouts on the track. But for the pregnant woman, I think it offers a good all-around workout, spending a little time on every part of the body. Women who are more fit than average may want to pause the tape during the toning sections and add an additional strength-building set to each exercise."
3,an oldie but a pretty goodie,"old videos never get too old, the outfits are a hoot, but the workout itself is pretty good, i enjoyed kathy's style and still like her videos, this is a decent prenatal video for anyone that wants an all around fun and intermediat(maybe high beginner) level video, it was fun to do again,"
4,"Excruciating, But it Works","This is a good workout, especially compared to the other workout DVD's I've tried while I'm pregnant. Kathy makes sure you work to your optimum ""pregnant"" ability (why do these instructors act like we're made of glass, just because we're pregnant?). However, you have to put up with the 80's outfits, bad music and routine, and the rap video that Kathy and her ""prego"" friends improvise between the 2nd and 3rd intervals. It's excruciating. But compared to other pregnancy workouts available to us... this is probably the one to invest in."
4,"A Fun, Easy Workout","I bought this tape when I was one month pregnant. What I liked about this video is that it had a prenatal and a postnatal workout. For the first 6 months I had no problem working out every day when I got home from work. However, after the 7th month, it became harder because the weather got hotter and hotter. My advice is if you are in your last trimester during the summer--as I was--alternate between the aerobic part (the first half of the first workout ) and the body conditioning (the second half of the first workout). Also, as your belly gets bigger, cut down on the amount that you do (it gets very hard towards the end).I am only giving this tape 4 stars because the second workout doesn't include advice for those of us who had to have a c-section (like me)."
2,Post Partum section is extremely bad,"I used this video along with two other videos; yoga, and buns of steel. I purchased this video because of the two sections it has and was really looking forward to using the postpartum after I had the baby. The prenatal routine is long but it is not hard at all. When played the postpartum section I found out that is entirely explanations of exercises to regain your fitness level there is not an actual routine I was really disappointed. Also my OBGYN told me that I could exercise six weeks after delivery, and the postpartum section is about your first six weeks after delivery. I would not recommend this tape."
3,it's and oldie goldie,"I thought when I first saw the video cover on Amazon that it was like a modern workout. Everyone is in spandex and have workout wedgies! haha It was a bit hard to concentrate on the workout. But it definitely seems like the type of workout that'll bring the benefits. It is not that expensive so give it a try, but the workout attire is just funny."
4,Good workout-a little dated (okay a lot),"I have always enjoyed Kathy Smith's workout videos and this is no exception. I got a good workout without feeling over tired and there are a variety of options for less energetic days. There is a good aerobics section followed by a toning section. I love all of the abdominal exercise options. I haven't seen that on any other DVD.A few problems with the DVD are that it is a little difficult to just get to the workout. There is a lot of talking before and after and it isn't organized in sections on the main menu. I assume that is because this was adapted from VHS. Also the outfits, the preggo rap and the music are very dated.Overall though, this is an awesome workout that I would recommend to any pregnant woman."
4,Retro is Cool!,"Who cares that the video is dated? Pilates were hard enough for me when I was not pregnant, so when I was pregnant, the Kathy Smith video was a perfect alternate workout - esp. on those cold winter days when sidewalks were icy and getting over to the pool was a hassle. It's not particularly challenging, but overall I would imagine that a little bit of movement, some muscle work and getting your heart pumping can only be helpful to you and your growing baby. I found it especially safe and appropriate for my final trimester. Plus, it's one of the few non-yoga/pilates pregnancy videos out there!"
4,Good all around workout for maintaining fitness level.,"I was in excellent shape before I got pregnant and continued my regular workouts for several months into my pregnancy. I bought this video tape to help keep me excerising as my belly got bigger and I became more clumsy! I think it a pretty good tape - a bit easy for my fitness level, but it gets my heart rate up and all-in-all, is a well-rounded, safe workout for pregnant women. I do supplement this with a step workout and some additional power-walking. I'm not sure it would provide me with enough of a workout on its own. However, I can reccommend it, especially for those with a mid-lower level of fitness."
4,Great System - True to the description.,"I needed an easy to use plug and play security camera system to monitor the outside of my home. I had it up and running minutes after I opened the box. The only thing to damper my excitement was that it did not come with the 9Volt battery needed to utlilize the wireless capability of the camrea. Check the SVAT website for a copy of the user instructions to see how easy it really is to use this system.The overall image quality is excellent when there is good light, but at night or in low light it is hard to make out details. But for a beginner level system that is super easy to set up and use, this can't be beat."
4,"Good, But could be better","This camera works fairly well. I wish it had a little better image. You can see cars real clear, but not the licence plate. I guess you get what you pay for if you try to go cheaper. The camera seems to be really durable and is nice and small. And it is extremly easy to hook up. It does't seem to interfere with our cordless phone, I was worried that it would. The longest distance that I could get it to work was probably about 100 feet. The Night vision isn't something to get all excited about. It does pick up reflective objects really well though. It's a good camera and all, but I wish I spent a little more money to be able to read the licence plate on a car."
4,nice,"works as specified, will drain a 9v battery in a matter of hours though, but thats expected because the camera consumes a lot of power; also the camera becomes quite hot after continuous operation, but does not seem to pose a problem."
4,"Great Product for the Day Time, with a good price","I needed something easy to install and wireless so I purchased the WSE201 and connected it to my 4 channel dvr in minutes. The product works fairly well during the day time for the price you pay for. The night vision works well only when the subject is close to the camera.Also keep in mind if you want to connect multiple cameras to a DVR and want to record simultaneously you will need to have a receiver per camera. And if you don't want to spend that money you can have the receiver scan the cameras one at a time, making recording possible, but not simultaneously."
2,Couldn't use with my wireless network,"Crashed my wireless router, turns out most of these systems use the same 2.4 Ghz band as most wireless routers."
1,"This camera does not deserve a single star,","This camera does not deserve a single star, toys may work better than this. If you connect to more than three meters can not see if there is someone at the front wall and if one can not see."
1,Disappointed,"Doesn't matter how close the camera and it's remote base is, vision is always bad and constant distortion,. Wanted to return it but I had went on a oversea job, here wondering if it still could be return."
2,Not easy to use at all,"I had to return this item because of the difficulty of use. We even had someone come to the house to install and he told us it wasn't even worth the money to pay for installation. Plus returning the camera was a nightmare, my printer is broken so I could not print a return label and had to call amazon numerous times to get a label mailed to me, which never happened, they ended up sending UPS to come to the house for pickkukp."
5,Le Creuset 6 Piece Set Carribean Blue,"I reccomend this product to any avid cook. Especially for soups and stews, the dutch oven is just...marvelous. Searing in the pan is a breeze and gives it great color. They are so easy to clean up. Its just great. I've been wanting this for a long time and it has met and exceeded my expectations."
2,Just Photos,"I felt burned by this purchase. My fault. I really expected that there would be more in the way of text to explain the great pictures. It is good that the pictures were collected and preserved for the public record in this book. However, I feel it was unfortunate that a text was not added. I'd love to know where things came from, how they were transported, logistics, supply issues, etc. I will have to look elsewhere for that information. If you want to have the story of German Combat Engineers as a collection of good historical photos, this qualifies."
3,Glass Top!,This game would be near perfect if it did not come with a glass top! Not sure why a child's learning toy would be made with a glass top?!
2,Misleading,I was very disappointed when I started this and Richard Simmons isn't on it....I felt like there was no organization and NO correct direction most of the time. Also felt that it had you over exert yourself on some of these when they are suppose to be for us older folks. I would not recommend it at all....
2,Not a sequel to Richard Simmons's workout,"If you are thinking this tape is a second volume of Richard Simmons and the Silver Foxes, think again. Richard Simmons never appears on this video, in spite of his name being on the listing. Instead, the stars' parents do it all themselves in what is billed as a ""non-aerobic, full-body conditioning and stretching program."" The exercises, such as they are, might be useful for older people who have never done any exercise and need just to get moving; however, the production is disorganized and amateurish. Golf clubs and tennis rackets are used as props for some exercises, which I suppose is to make us think the exercises have something to do with those sports--but in reality, they don't. The beginning and end contain advertising for a food supplement and other products that one suspects is the real reason this tape was produced. If you are serious about getting a senior-level workout, stick with the real Simmons tape and continue your search."
2,2 1/. Stars I'd give,"Hello this is some fake a-- sh--. Nothing good, and only 2 scenes that were some what real. I understand that an actress has to take a job in something but this movie couldve been written better, directed better. I shouldve stuck with first review, but like I said always see it for yourself. But this movie was effortlessly disappointing, no erotic night, and the building scene was the same through out the movie. Take it from me don't buy it, don't get it. TTFN, :("
5,Best I've Found,"I am adding my review because I hate tosee somebody pass up on this great productbecause of the previous negative reviews.I have to state for the record that I havenever tried to hand mix this, nor have Iever used milk or water.I make a green smoothie every morning withvarious fruits, juices, leafy greens and somesort of supplement. Being that I am mostlyvegan I need a supplement with plant protein,and since Soy and I have a love/hate relationshipthis is perfect for me.The vanilla has a wonderful flavor and mixeswell with anything. The apple cinnamon wasvery different than anything I'd ever tried,but half way through my first glass I was a fan.I use a blender and it always blends perfectlyinto whatever I've created that day. It is a bitchalky - but that is a small price to pay for sucha great boost.They sell sample packets of this product ifyou want to try it before you invest twentybucks - but my personal opinion is order it,use a blender, and you'll love it! I do."
1,"yucky, yucky, yucky","This may be the best stuff ever, but it tastes like slimy green pond scum. I have tried to put just a tiny bit in my shake, but I still taste the nastiness. Maybe some of these other reviewers were paid or something--I don't see how we can be drinking the same thing."
2,Great for you but very difficult to get down,"This is a great product and I love all the vitamins in it but I am having a very hard time getting it down. I have tried it with vanilla and chocolate soy milk, with Pb2 (peanut butter powder) and fruit and I just cant seem to drink the whole thing (i just start to gringe after forcing down a few sips). Does anyone have suggestions? Please I love that this is a whole food and natural but I cant get past the taste."
3,Smells Wonderful,"Smells AMAZING, but tastes like I went out in my back yard and dug up a handfull of dirt and grass :(Yes, you can add stuff to sorta negate the bad/funky tastes, and yes I feel so much better when I use it and I LOVE Alive products but be prepared to hold your nose and drink fast.Smoothie:I usually do 1 c. coconut dream, 1 tsp honey, 2 tsp coconut oil, and 1 cup water)"
3,Nutrition is good but tastes rough,"I really want to like this and continue using it but the flavor is beyond weird. The very sweet vanilla flavor mixes with the taste of peas, is kinda like I would imagine peas mixed with frosting to taste like. I think it would be better without added flavors."
3,7 shades of nasty,"The ingredient list is great, good amount of protein and fiber with great whole food ingredients which is why I gave it 3 stars. To say that this is an ""acquired"" taste is somewhat of an understatement. It seems like most people add this to other stuff and I know why - by itself the taste is ""7 shades of nasty"" :)My wife, who is deep into raw and vegan food, cant stand the taste but agrees that the ingredient list is impressive. Anyone got any ides on how to doctor this thing up to avoid a gag reflex?"
5,Excellent!,"Excellent flavor, nice soy-free/casein-free protein source, and easily mixes with water - which provides a nice and accessible mixer option without additional calories."
1,If it tastes this bad it better be really good for you.,"Don't buy this for the taste because it is na-na-nasty. Everyone is the house found it unpalatable. Before buying this you should find it in person and take a whiff first. Going back to Lifetime Life Basics for plant protein. Recommend Optimum Nutrition vanilla custard flavor for egg protein, or Designer Whey vanilla for whey protein."
2,Used to be delicious when it was rice and pea protein,"I've purchased the Alive Vanilla pea & rice protein (vs. the soy) shake for many years. I've had lots of people in my family taste it when they asked. Universally, they liked it and would say things like, ""I could drink this kind of shake.""Flash forward to last week when my husband reordered the shake for me and I saw the label now says ""Pea Protein"" with no mention of rice protein.The taste is much stronger, sweeter, and simply not as palatable as the prior version.I'm very disappointed and will no longer be a customer of this product."
1,Item described different from item delivered,The item that I received in the mail was not the Alive Rice and Pea protein powder. It was the Alive Pea Protein powder. These are two different products and I was specifically looking for the Rice & Pea protein product.
1,ugh...a little hard to swallow,I purchased this solely on reviews and I was utterly disappointed. This item has an odd after taste and I have to mix it with water only. I tried once with almond milk and I wanted to gag.
3,"Good multivitamin, but terrible taste.","I have been taking Viactiv multivitamins for a couple years now, but I wanted to try something with more daily value. I have a problem swallowing pills, especially big ones, which most vitamins tend to be. I tried the Vanilla Alive! shake mix in chocolate milk, and I could not take the taste. It turned the milk green, and it tasted nothing like Vanilla, even with a bunch of Hershey's syrup in it. The percent daily values of the shake are great, but it is hard to get a heaping 1/4 cup of it down every day. I am going to stick to Viactiv."
4,Alive Whole Food Energizer,Love this stuff. Breakfast that's healthy and doesn't leave you starving for more carbs. It has helped me control my appetite and get a good start to every day.
1,Terrible smell and flavor,"Awful smell and flavor. I've known these shake supplements to not have the most appealing flavor, but nothing compares to how bad this was."
2,Nasty,This stuff tastes so nasty I couldn't tell you if it's a good product or not. Couldn't drink it and I tried it with different things. Yucky!
3,Great Ingredients - Too Bad About the Taste,"I've been consuming protein shakes for years and have pretty low expectations on the taste front, but WOW, these shakes rate just too high on ""YUK"" scale for me to buy again.Of course, if you don't care at all about taste, I'd actually recommend buying because ingredient-wise this product is a juggernaut of health."
4,good meal replacer.,"The flavor is a bit less appealing,.... but when you consider it is a meal replacer, and not just protein, it isn't bad."
2,Let The Buyer BEWARE,"It SAYS rice/pea, on my invoice it said SOY, so I contacted Amazon and was ASSURED it was rice/pea, but I GOT SOY! Can't say the taste is all that great, but I am using it rather than sending it back. BUT if you want RICE/PEA protein powder like I did, MAKE SURE to check your invoice. I'm not at all fond of the taste of the vanilla soy. I will use it up, it may well be very healthy. Hoping next time to get rice/protein, but I just got an email and was told....they're out of! So not even sure why it's still saying it's available. DISAPPOINTED!"
4,LOVE IT!,"I have been using muscle milk protein powder for a while and was looking for something new that was ""naturally healthy"" and that would give me an energy boost. Wow, am I impressed with this! I put one scoop in a blender with soy milk, ice, berries, a banana, olive oil, and ground flax seeds. I was pleasantly suprised at what a naturally sweet flavor it had. It had no yucky after taste and went down very nice. I'm sorry to read other people had trouble with it mixing without a blender b/c it really is a good product. I think a blender's the only way to go with protein drinks, then you can add other healthy things and ice to make it extra cold. I'm so excited I found something so healthy that tastes great too!"
2,Not what I thought,"I chose the 'Vanilla' flavor because I didn't know how it would taste and like vanilla flavored things. Well it tastes like baby food, pureed peas, I know its pea powder but it is a very strong pea taste and no vanilla. After mixing it with some yogurt it wasn't too bad."
1,Bad tasting,The drink tastes like cold pea soup flavored with vanilla. Lots of good stuff in it but I just couldnt get past the taste.
1,HORRIBLE,"I purchased this Protein Shake because it is dairy free plus the fact it sounded healthy which I am sure it is but the taste is so bad that it made me sick to my stomach. That in itself is unhealthy. I will never use this product again and will look for another alternative unless all ""Natural Products"" are like this. Can any other health concious individuals make any recommendations ??"
2,good and nasty,"I feel great but as several people mentioned the flavor is not like a vanilla whey shake. Imagine a strong sweet green vanilla taste.Almost unpalatable, I wish this had no flavoring and tasted like....peas!"
2,Very bad flavor for the apple cinnamon,"I have tried a lot of these shakes (see my reviews if you are curious) and I think this is one of the worst, flavor-wise. The vanilla soy protein version is not bad at all - in fact, I like it more than many of the other brands for the texture and flavor.But the apple cinnamon pea protein is completely unpalatable. I've tried to hide it with bananas and berries - maybe orange juice would work? Who knows. I know it's tempting to chase something that claims to taste like apple cinnamon, but I would order a small container or get a different flavor."
1,Uck.,Glad I got this in a single serving at Super Supplements. It was hard to choke down and an hour later I feel logged down.I'm going to stick with Amazing Grass for green supplement: http://www.amazon.com/Amazing-Grass-Chocolate-Superfood-8-5-Ounce/dp/B00112EUPM
3,Not what I was expecting at all!,"I purchased this pack at an extreme discount. I have owned several Blackhawk items in the past. I was very upset, it's a tiny little pack. not what I was expecting at all. I am 6'4, 250 lbs, it looks like a kids pack on my back. yes, it's built well, has all the bells and whistles. I guess I'll give it to one of my kids."
2,Get the newer edition,"The information is the pretty much the same, but the accompanying DVD in the new edition is worth the extra money."
1,Wasted space,"The author repeats information, and not necessarily useful information. He repeats reference information in different areas. This book has too much information. It is not designed to teach a musician how to grasp percussion techniques. It is too detailed. An educator that is not a percussionist needs a quick reference."
2,Another sad day for the NY Phil.,"After ups and downs with Pierre Boulez and Zubin Mehta as music direcotrs, the demoralized New Yrok Philharmonic decided to rebuild by hiring the respected German conductor Kurt Masur. He improved the orchestra's discipline, but at a cost of a decade of incredibly dull performances.This Brahms First is one of the slowest and least involving ever recorded. It's painfully sodden, and one can only extend sympathy to the musicians who remember the golden days under Bernstein. Recorded sound is fine, as in the orchestra's playing, but does that matter? Masur is the anti-Bernstein, bending over backward to make sure that there's not an ounce of personality and excitement. How fortunate that he has departed."
4,"Very cute for kids, live sections a bit awkward","In Antonio Meets His Match we meet Antonio and his friends who live together in a garden. They all get along well until a new group of ants moves to the garden. They are rude and play weird music. Antonio really doesn't like these new neighbors and the new neighbors are unkind to Antonio. Antonio learns that even though the other ants are unkind, he needs to learn to love his neighbors.The cartoon portions of this DVD are adorable and my children love the characters. They learn a wonderful message in a fun, and entertaining way. The one part of the DVD that felt forced and awkward were the segments where Max Lucado and Hermie discuss loving our neighbors. These segments just felt uncomfortable. While I enjoy Mr Lucado's books and the cartoon on the DVD, he is a bit awkward on film. Having said that, this DVD is great for kids! The story is cute and they learn a wonderful message!"
3,replacement mirror,"Fit ok but small trim piece missing from bottom and made different internally, but not visible when installed"
1,Dated recording...,"This recording was made in 1940's Italy, apparently intended as a movie soundtrack (according to the liner notes.)As such it is rather poorly recorded, with plenty of noise of varying level and intensity, and sounds as if it were recorded through a modern-day cellular phone.Avoid."
1,worthless,This was a pricey manual that has no content. It contains very few pages and the information in them is available elsewhere for less money.
2,Not too impressed,"I have quite a few strawbale books, and I think this one I probably could have done without. Don't plan on using this book alone to do any projects."
3,The Blizzard classic,"I loved the game when It first came out but is was DOS! lol but this one works really well on windows 2000/xp and even Vista.. Classic game, the grafics are dated but man it's fun to play. Hope it works on windows 7..."
5,awesome reissue of a classic,"I remember playing this game on my old pentium 60 that ran Windows 3.11. The game is exactly the same now, but it, amazingly still holds up, unlike many games from the same time, like Doom II, and the like. Blizzard are an awesome company, and have really spiffed up Warcraft II in this version. The most noticable is the addition of about 50 or so single player custom scenarios to choose from, and Blizzard combining the actual game and its add-on in one CD, saving the buyer bucks. Also, less important to me, but still really cool is the multiplayer set-up. Though I have yet to try it out for myself, I'm sure I will be in the fall when I go back to school and my T1 connection. everyone I've talked to so far about it said the multiplayer interface is great. Judging from the upgrades to the single-player part of the game, it seems like they're right."
5,Great RTS Game,"I don't own this game, but have played it in school. I haven't played the campaign missions, but have played multiplayer almost everyday for 2 months. The graphics are dated, but that isn't where the fun is. For me it is the fast paced-ness of the game that keeps me hooked. Unlike most RTSs I have played, each misson doesn't have to take an hour and a half to complete. If you know how to build, it can take you 5 minutes to defeat a game aginst a single computer opponent. You can also build crazily, and go like that, or you can develop a strategy and either way, you stand a chance of winning.My suggestion for those just starting: 1 build your hall and 4 or five farms while cranking out peons/pesants like crazy. Then build 3 barracks and make another town near another gold mine. Don't stop building peons unless you are running out of money."
3,Great!,"This game is very interesting. I never played Warcraft 2 for more than 30 minutes before I bought it. I really got into it. But then you play the second race. They are the same. If you want to play this and Starcraft. Play StarCraft second, so then you won't find this one at times mundane. Yet it still gets kudos from me. Just play Tides of Darkness and Beyond the Dark Portal with your favorite LOOKING race. Take into consideration the annoying Orc voice. Still good. Does not need to rely on graphics."
5,An all-time classic.,"This is an old game, and it continues to entertain me for hours. Sometimes its age shows, with poor pathfinding (when you try to send units across the map, they can get stuck in trees), and with basically one race (orc and human are pretty much the same, only orc is better). However, none of these shortcomings matter, because the gameplay is better than any other game I've played, even if there is only one race and a lack of conveniences like rally points and such.I'm probably making a lot of people not want to get this game with this review, or more likely no one cares about this review, but I'll just reassert that the multiplayer in this game brings me the most enjoyment I've ever had when it comes to video games."
1,2010 Model is downgraded,"Pedro's Prestige Floor Pump that I just received has the same part number: 6450500, BUT it has hard plastic handle, cheap black plastic base (not Steel Barrel and Base as stated in the description). And it looks cheap and flimsy comparing to the pump pictured on Amazon. Looks like Pedro's decided to make it a bit more ""cost effective"". Don't waste your money."
1,WHAT???,This video lasted about 15 minutes and featured one very-hard-to-follow dance. Do not waste your money. I am very disappointed that I bought this for my daughter.
2,too hard,I read all the other reviews and most of the comments were that the workouts were too hard and they were right. My daughter only used the dvd once.
1,Leaky Mess,"I just got this pan at target, and it's terrible. My first attempt left cake batter all over the oven. There's no way to lock in the insert. The seal is terrible. I'm returning the pan today."
1,Angel food cake pan gets a zero,The Wilton two piece angel food cake pan leaked cake batter all over my oven which caught on fire and caused a big mess. I had to transfer the batter to two loaf pan to try to salvage my cake. I'm very disappointed as I trusted the Wilton name to be top notch in quality. I would not even give it one star.
1,wilton angel food pan,Very unhappy with this product. No instructions with it. No way for insert to lock into pan. Caused my Christmas cake to leak all over the inside of my new oven. Pan is so bad I threw it away.
3,"Tame, But Enjoyable","If you are looking to be scared out of your wits, this is not going to do it. Mentioning or comparing those two movies with this production is false advertising. These stories are allegedly true, but fall flat with cheesy special effects (the light emanating from a ghost is just a spotlight chasing people around) and tame plotlines. Not to mention every story is told by a girl, usually junior high age. Males exist only in supporting roles in two tales.The stories are more relaxing than anything else. The slight spookiness here is best served as an appetizer for a truly terrifying film."
2,Not really that scary,"Now just so you know a little about me, I love Japanese horror films and Japanese horror shorts, but this set of stories were really not that scary. There was possibly 2 or 3 out of the 10 that were good, but nothing special. If you're looking for a dvd with actually scary Japanese horror shorts I would go with Tales of Terror From Tokyo: The Movie (The Volume sets are really bad compared to the movie). However, if you REALLY love j-horror and have to watch it, get it."
1,surprised,"I was very disappointed when I received the poster. It was grainy and dull. I have other posters that are bright and vibrant, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. Not worth the money!"
3,Waste of Money,"I am not a math whiz by any means, but I've had other statistics textbooks that were a lot more helpful than this one. It doesn't always break down all the steps in a problem and often doesn't include why to use certain formulas or why to use certain tables in the appendix. It's not written like it's geared towards students, its written like reference material for statisticians who already know what they're doing. Then again, the professor who teaches the class in which I use this book can barely speak English, so I'm learning everything strictly from this textbook."
1,Do NOT recommend,"I found this book to be thoroughly frustrating! While many examples are very helpful, the authors explanation leaves much to be desired. There are many many assumptions made in this book that you simply 'know' what he is talking about. There are errors and considering there is now a 9th edition out that is unacceptable. There are many places the author seems to run out of gas in his explanation of new ideas or else a computer is going to figure it out so not go into more detail. He does not follow through on problems and does not explain where he got an answer until a page or 2 later...leaving one frustrated as one tries to understand. I could go on and on, but this is NOT a very good book. While it may contain biological settings to get across what he is trying to prove, that does not mean he explains the statistical component very well. I would not recommend it at all,or else make sure you have a professor that can explain all the nuances that Daniel misses."
3,Many Many mistakes.,"Let's look at chapter 9. You will find the following mistakes. (1) Page 419. Figure 9.4.5 (d) r squared - 1, it should be r squared - 0. (2) Page 417 Formula (9.4.1) ""-"" should be ""+"" (3) Page 421 8. Statistical decision. Where did they get 8.25? (4) Page 403 Figure 9.2.1 intercept=0 Normally, it is not 0. Anyway, 0 is not totally wrong.I hate this book."
4,Biostatistics book review,This book is very easy to follow. It gives a description of the subject followed by the formulas and numerous examples. There are many helpful problems that follow the chapter.
2,Not what I expected,"The calculator is good but the thing is when I press one button, the one next to it is somehow pressed too, so I never see on the screen what I have to see. Maybe it is just this particular one. I ended up using a TI-83 for my financial calculations. It is more complicated, but it works much better."
4,Good Gift,I bought this one as a gift for my friend in USA. She loves it very much. It's soft and warm. I'm happy to make a right choice.
4,The Humpers big break?,"This was the mighty Humpers at the hight of their super powers and anyone who saw them live during this era knows what I'm talking about. Fast, F#%ked and furious just about sums up the brutal power of The Humpers on stage. The only real problem with this record is that the production is just a little too clean. The Humpers were best seen live and up close. The perfect band for drunken, chaotic fun. All of that said, The Humpers really knew how to bring Heartbreakers/Chuck Berry style rock'n'roll into the present and blast the genre right into the future. 1000 years from now people will be scratching their heads wonderin' how this band didn't have top 40 hits. The Humpers would have beat me up for saying that."
1,What Horrible Acting!,"OMG! What horrible horrible horrible acting. This video was a waste of time and money. The actors/actress, especially the lead, definitely needed acting classes. The script that they were projecting did not match the influxion or tone of their voice. Most of the time, it was as if they were reading lines! I'm not sure if it was because this movie was created in the 70s and that may have been how all acting was, but I doubt it! Save your money."
5,Good product at a good price,"Went on without a hitch, nice quality. Instructions could be a little clearer on how to attach the bumper to the boot...initally seems like it is upside down acording to the picture. Would recommend this product."
2,"Fun, sketchy, and abstruse","My experience in reading this book has been very much like: (1) Reading Dilbert -- It's a somewhat fun look at problems all to familiar to experienced developers and managers. (2) Reading someone's viewgraphs after missing the presentation -- The authors attempt to catalog the AntiPatterns, so many ideas are presented in bulleted form. Buzz words are perhaps overused, too. (3) Reading the Bible -- Many sentences are just too abstruse for me. A lot of effort is required to get the (apparently) *deeper* meaning.The book's greatest, lasting value will be in codifying the many recurring software development problems, and establishing a vocabulary for discussing them. I hope a later edition will correct some of the recondite language."
4,Reality in front of us,"This book showed me the reality: problems in management and development. And then a solution appears to every problem. These problems repeat again and again over time. Sadly, we don't stop to review those problems, prefering to omit them than confront. Now, the book give us the description about problems explicity and the related solutions. And, in practice, it's very useful. Commonly observed, the Analysis Paralysis is an anti-pattern for large projects, and cause the major problems in management.The book is the evidence to the existence of very annoying problems, that frecuently are omited and it's consequences are disasterous. I think it's recommended to management and engineering professionals. Possibly applicable to another branches of engineering."
5,Pleasurable Read,This is a great read. Almost every paragraph had me thinking back to some real-life incident. Funny as hell.
2,So So,"This one is okay but far from great. Mowbray's books make a few good points but you have to wade through way too much fluff. Straight and to the point works best for me. The first few chapters were lacking, though the book is somewhat entertaining and makes several good points."
1,Wish I could give it 0 stars,"This book is terrible. It should have been written by one author (NOT Dr. Mowbray), which would spare the reader of having to read the same concept rehashed four times by all four authors. Of course, then there would not have been enough text to fill a book.Save a few trees and some money as well. Don't bother with this book."
5,A dermatology book for primary care and dermatologists alike,"This is an exceptional book for both education and clinical use. It has 10-15 pictures of each disease instead of just one or two. The best part is the INTEGRATION/UNIFYING concept paragraph. It really cuts to the chase and makes sense of confusing issues. The only real fault, if there is one, is that it is a little heavy on the histopathology for primary care. That is in no way distracting and will satisfy those who wish to know more. The most pictures of any derm book I have seen other than a pure atlas. Highly recommended."
4,bits & pieces,"The selections of this volume were made so as to coordinate and supplement, without duplication, with Maximus material already available in English translation. Thus widening our access to sources. The scholarly discussion of intro and footnotes gives good guidance and companionship to the reader."
1,plug in cable to the PDA,"I'm having a hard time pulling the cable out from my palm Zire71 and tungsten T3, I complained to Belkin several times ,they said there is a knob in the front that you can press on to facilate the removal of the cable from the palm , the knob does not seem to be moving at all. I just wish I bought a Palm product instead , I don't know if the cable is defective."
3,Old and Out Dated,"White's ""stirrup"" thesis was shown to be incorrect by Bernard Bachrach over 30 years ago. It was an interesting hypothesis at the time, but now has become one of those ideas (such as medieval people thinking the world was flat) that half-educated school teachers tell students and that even gets into the less well-edited textbooks.In other words, read this book if you are interested in the history of ideas, but not for conclusions any professional medieval specialist would accept."
5,"Relevant, not outdated","This book was part of the PhD curriculim at a top-tier university for Public Policy. The course was Science & Technology Policy I (a massive literature review before getting into our own research).Whether or not the chain of events and relationships occurred precisely as White postulates is irrelevant.The POINT is that small, technological change can have GIANT impacts upon life and social organization. This has been proven repeatedly by the researchers/students of complexity science (see Mitchell Waldrop, Murray Gell-Mann, Roger Lewin, John Holland, etc.)By connecting medieval technological change (eg agrarian practices, stirrup, clock) to societal change (eg feudal system, settlement/town patterns), this book provides readers with a conceptual starting point to begin thinking about the impact of modern and future technologies.In short, its a quick, VERY stimulating and interesting read. With the price at only 2 dollars, you can't go wrong!"
4,A fresh look at an unexplored area,"Lynn White's study is a fascinating read and should be part of any study of medieval history. It is very difficult to study technology without good narrative sources, and White does have some trouble assigning dates to different advances. Yet this book is most valuable for the attention that it pays to aspects of medieval history that too often go ignored, exploring the effects of basic inventions like the stirrup or the heavy plough on military strategy, daily life, and medieval culture. White's best work covers the period from the 6th to the 9th centuries, and this book would serve as a very good companion to Pirenne's _Economic and Social History_, which focuses on later periods."
4,Just another intereted person,"I had to read this book for a class titled, ""The Historian's Craft."" Although Lynn White Jr's book contained many foreign languages (all translated in footnotes and endnotes), and refered to many historical events (events that could easily be looked up in a history book), I thought it was put together quite well. I had to give a fifteen minute presentation on Lynn White Jr. and this book, which I stretched into thirty minutes because there was so much to talk about. Great book!"
2,"Flat, unimaginative, pointless","What a silly premise for a book. One poem in the voice of the non-existent black man whom Susan Smith said took her sons, okay, maybe. A whole cycle? Ugh. Are blacks are oppressed; is racism insidious? Yes, of course, duh. But Eady has nothing to say except to repeat and repeat the sequence's only idea--""isn't it rotten that the bogeyman is imagined as black in this racist world""--(to which I answer, ""yeah, sure, and?"") in uninspired language. The Running Man sequence unfortunately isn't much better. But I saw the musical that was made out of this sequence and at least on the page we're spared the silly preenings of actors convinced they're doing something revolutionary when in fact they're just rehashing rehashed material. Publisher's Weekly's comparison of Eady to Ai is way off: Ai's work is subtle, nuanced, complicated and well-written."
5,A great investigation and a solid conclusion based on available data,"This book was exceptional. I have been an Atlantis investigator for 45 years and this is the closest theory to where Atlantis actually was that I have ever read. Read this book and then do some follow up research on Timeas and Criteas and study more about South America, and it becomes obvious that Allen has the best theory on record about Atlantis. I have read many books on the subject since my original reading and this book still stands as the best theory available today. Many alternative theories are primarily propaganda campaigns to encourage tourism. This book is definitly not propaganda and is well supported with plent of data the suggests that the Jim's theory is correct.(5/20/2008)"
3,So-so,"Atlantis in Bolivia? Well, I have my doubts but his arguments are quite interesting. Unfortunately, book itself is far from great-its written in rather monotonous manner, and I certainly could have done without Plato's original account which I read numerous times before and which was putting me to sleep. A shame, because author's ideas are very original."
3,Pennsylvania History,"Helpful to Philadelphia, particularly Germantown, history buffs with descriptions of locations in the 17th and 18th centuries. Those interested in the evolution of Protestant theology in America will find this account fascinating. Be advised, however, that the font is very small and can not be enlarged. Overall it is a masterful piece of research."
2,too much money for its worth,You are lucky if you get two full hours off this battery after 3 cycles. Buy a 6-cell battery from Dell. It's more expensive but less aggravating.
5,Absolutely brilliant!,Basic? Basically brilliant! Authors make good use of humor while teaching a very difficult language. I now feel confident in my ability to communicate in Ukrainian.
3,Does its job.,"It's ok, it does its job. However, in the very first use, your forehead will end up black, full of small pieces of the Headband, until you wash it for the first time."
2,wish it was thinner,"Got this very quickly, i was a bit disappointed, it was wider than i thought it would be...wish they could make these things thinner.. other than that the quality was great."
2,not very absorbant,i know these sweatbands are not very expensive but they sure aren't very absorbant either. I still had sweat running down my face from my head when wearing these bands...I guess you get what you pay for.
2,lacking in absorbency,"I ride a bike indoors during the winter months. I wear a sweat band in an attempt to cut down on the sweat dripping onto my bike and the floor. I purchased three of these and have found them lacking in absorbency. I have other bands purchased from a different manufacturer and can ride a good 20 miles before the band is saturated. These bands barley make it 5 miles before the sweat is dripping from my forehead. They are comfortable and fit well, but their ability to hold moisture is severely lacking."
5,Great deal!,"I absolutely love these. It seems really hard to find sweatbands that are good quality and inexpensive. Most sports brands make them but they are thin, the elastic doesn't last long, and they are usually $6-12. These were so affordable that I bought 10 and I was floored by the quality. They are thick and soft. I don't know yet how long they will hold up, but at this price it would be worth it even if they wear out quickly (for me, that means the elastic wears out or gets crunchy). I really couldn't be happier with these and I've been looking for good quality, cheap sweatbands for years.As an aside, these are also wide. They are thick, as in the cotton is tightly woven. But they are also wide across the band. Most sweatbands are about two fingers wide and this is more like three. I personally like that, but I thought I should note that since I'm not sure it's obvious from the photo."
2,Pretty disappointed,"These headbands are not very absorbent, contrary to what other reviews led me to believe. I have to go through about 3 just for a one hour tennis match. I have other headbands from Unique Sports that are much more absorbent (1 per match). Those are more expensive, but now I think well worth it, given the comparison with the GOGO ones."
2,too wide and too small for an adult head,Nice and wide but the diameter is too small for an adult head. Might be good for a child except that the width might be too wide for a child.
4,thick and brightly colored,The sweatbands are thick and brightly colored. They were a little tight for me to wear for a full workout but may stretch with time. I think shipping was high for such a light item.
1,"Let It Shed, Let It Shed, Let It Shed","I hate these terry cloth headbands and I bought four of them. While I'm doing my skincare routine on my face, I use these to keep my bangs and my hair dry and moisturizer free. I wear these headbands for ten minutes, and that's pushing it. They are WAY too tight and downright painful. And yes, I stretched them out before even using them and they still hurt! And what is up with the shedding? Bits of blue, or purple or green terry cloth everywhere! These things shed like crazy! On the bathroom sink, in the sink, on the floor, on the bathmat, on my clothes, in my hair. Its ridiculous! I have another terry cloth headband and I've had that thing for years and its never shed, not from day one. And before I ever used it, I also stretched it out, many times, and it never shed. These headbands are garbage and I'm sorry I bought them. Skip 'em."
3,good product,"Nothing special...better made than many store brands. Gets saturated pretty quickly. Good fit. So, I am happy with this purchase but will still look for a better sweatband."
3,"Nice product, but...","Product is nice, I mean, it's a headband that stretches and fits on your head comfortably, it's not a coo-coo clock.The item came to me with a 4-day delay though, and wrote a seller feedback pointing this out. The seller immediately contacted me, asking to remove the comment, and in exchange, would give me a discount on my next purchase of 5%! LOL"
4,Good quality- mulitipurposed,"I ordered a large number of these for my son's therapist. We use them to put on the children for their ""theraputic listening"" headphones. It helps keep the headphones on their head. Washable and cheap enough. Plus the kids get to pick the colors they want!"
4,I like this product,"I have a smaller head - 6 7/8 hat size - so to me the bands are comfortable.I have used them under extreme conditions - 90 degrees/75% humidity in a warehouse setting.(Before using these GOGOs, sweat would always run down my forehead and drop on my glasses - very aggravating.)Now the bands absorb all the sweat - I rinse them under cold water and wring them out several times a day.I do have to turn them inside out, so I don't get a mark from the inside stitch line on my forehead, though.Perhaps a seamless version would be better.By the way - when my product arrive a day later than the longest delivery date promised, the vendor refunded my shipping charges.I found that to be very accomodating of them."
1,too tight!!!,"Put it on to find it's way too tight. My head is not especially big, but I can't tolerate tight sqeeze or I get a headache pretty fast. Seem very well made, but unfortunately I can't use them :("
3,Pretty small.,"When I first saw the product, I had the thought of my previous headband that fit so perfectly around my head and how stretchy it was. Keep in mind, I have a somewhat big head, around 7 5/8 cap size. When I got these in the mail, I literally had to stretch them and break the lining just to wear em. Even then, it feels uncomfortable, too tight, and I get headaches easily. At this time, I'm hoping that, with some use, it'll stretch out on its own. Either way, for the price it was at, it's not that bad."
2,Too small.,"This is a well made product and it fits my daughter fine, but not me. Granted, my head is fairly large, but I can't wear this without getting a headache. If you have a big head, look elsewhere. Small head? Go for it."
2,Good product - long wait for delivery in Canada!!,"The headbands are of good quality but I was incredibly disappointed with the shipping.I placed the order 5 weeks before I needed the product, and the shipping was supposed to take 5-10 business days. I complained and brought up the fact that I needed them for one weekend tournament only and I was assured they will arrive in time. Finally, they were delivered the Monday after our tournament - so disappointing and such a waste of money and time. I was refunded the S&H; portion, but I'm still very bitter. Keep in mind, I live in Canada and they shipping had to go through customs, but there was never any warning of late delivery."
1,You've Got to Be Kidding Me with the Shipping Costs!I,I was going to order six of these at $1.29 each and the total with shipping came to just under $29.00!!! Are you kidding me? It should have been more like $11 total. Rather defeated the purpose. No sale. Deleted from cart. I don't need to deal with crooked companies and bait and switch tactics.
2,Small!,"I have a small head and this is very tight. I've been trying to stretch it out, but no luck yet. Will keep trying, but avoid unless you have an extremely small head or are shopping for a youth."
2,"Good quality, but too smal to be stylish","I bought three of them. The bands are of high quality. Very thick. And they don't lose elasticity. In other words, unlike other bands, these will not become too big. The problem is, these bands are TOO SMALL. I'm only 5 ft tall. I don't have a gigantic head. But these bands are awfully tight for me. Due to their short length, the bottom of them rests about half way on the back of my head, and pulls my hair very high. So I look awful from the side. If the bands were longer, they would not pull my hair that high, yet they would still pull away my hair to allow my neck to cool off. That would be perfect.I have tried everything to stretch the bands, e.g., put them in the drier, wrap them around a drawer, So far I have only been able to stretch an inch.Maybe they are supposed to be wore around the head like a ring. But that does not allow ventilation on the neck. How much I wish they could be two inches longer. I would buy a dozen of them then."
1,Too tight or little head?,I purchased this to wear but its too tight. So maybe I am untrained in making a right purchase. The product itself arrived on time as promised. Quality is good. But either its too tight or my head is to big. Since this was my first time buying one I believe its my lack of knowledge.
1,GOGO Thick Solid Color Headband / Sweatband,"Unfortunately, this item was too tight for my big head. The frame width of my current glasses is 133cm just to give you an idea."
5,cheap & good,for $2 these headband are amazingly GREAT! I purchased these as a gift for a friend & she loves them.
2,"Meh, too small and smell like firearm lubricant..","I got a couple of them just because they were priced well. I have an average to large head and they are too tight.. pretty much to the point of pain. So I did what everybody else with similar complaints did and attempted to stretch them a bit.. still too snug. To top things off they have this strong odor of gun oil, which might not be a complaint for some of us ;)I've washed them, stretched them, and done everything but beat them with a hammer and just can't use them as headbands. HOWEVER, I made the best out of the situation and use them around my neck as a makeshift turtleneck while mountain biking in the winter. I suppose these are amazing for people with medium to average heads, but for us big headed people.. keep looking!"
5,It Does the Job,"Good basic sweatband. Shipping was fast and the sweatband does exactly what I bought it for - to keep the sweat out of my eyes while running. It's old fashioned and I look like I'm from the 70s when I wear it, but as long as my eyes don't sting I'm OK. Recommended!"
3,Absorbent But Tight Fit,"I picked up one of these to test and just finished wearing it during a 45 minute workout. I sweat a lot and it definitely did the job of absorbing it. But I would agree with the other reviews that say it's on the small side.I don't find it to be unbearably tight, but I'd prefer a little looser fit--I'm an adult male with an average sized head and short hair.This didn't stop me from ordering two more. I'm hoping they'll stretch a little over time. You can't beat the price."
5,"excellent, can't be beat at this price","I have bought ten of these now. They hold up well with repeat washings. I sweat a great deal from my forehead and I have an oversize head; with these, there is no problem. It could be that these would slide down over your eyes if you had a tiny head or if you were a child; I don't know about that.I got the white ones (and yes, they are still white after several washings). I can't vouch for how colorfast the colored ones are."
5,Great Sweatband!,I love this sweatband. It's soft and stays in place while I run on the trend-mil. I worried it might be too tight based on reviews but my head measures 7 1/4 (gotta a lot of hair) and it fit comfortably.
3,Server 2003 for Dummies,I guess I am too dumb for this book.It didn't help me at all with basic information
1,What helps me stove without bottle,"I bought the stove for my friend flying trip to AustraliaAnd after he flew, he opened it and saw that it had the bottleIt came without the bottle and it angered meI wrote an email to the Company and not for commentIn summaryWhat helps me stove without bottle"
1,This cd has the plague!,"Well, it doesnt really, but for your own sake, treat it like it has! stay well, well away. Every song on this album is exactly the same, no i dont mean similar I MEAN THE SAME!!. If you want to spend your hard earned cash on something worthless, why not go and buy 15 odd socks or a bag of empty drinks cans? or failing that you could even send your money to me, i'll make good use of it. This cd is definately high on the AVOID list, matched only by all of westlife's cd's or anything by so solid crew. If you really want a cd then i will recomend ""songs for the deaf"" by queens of the stone age or ""reroute to remain"" by In flames."
2,Done in by the publisher,"Unfortunately, the fonts, layouts, and poor editing make this book painful to read. It does contain useful advice for collecting and applying cultural information about your users."
3,Good Luck Finding it,"Apparently it is a limited edition, which was supposed to be numbered, but mine wasn't. If you like Tom Hingley, the reason to get this would be the much better remix of the song Soulfire.I once saw Tom move a fallen tree off the road by punching it into bits with his bare hands. It shattered into sawdust."
4,"Good, but not great","Just to resolve the controversy over the episodes included:The bonus episodes are ""Sinbad Sails Alone"" and ""Best Clowns in Town""; ""Save the Day"" will probably appear on upcoming Into the Deep DVD.My son loves Backyardigans, but this one is a mixed bag. He didn't care for ""Movers of Arabia"", but ""Cops and Robots"" is one his all-time favorites. The two 'bonus' episodes are a novelty right now, but don't seem memorable to me; Tasha appears in the first and Austin in the second."
1,Save the Day NOT on DVD,"I bought this DVD only because all press that I previously read indicated ""Save the Day"", my daughter's favorite episode, would be included. However, ""Save the Day"" was not on the DVD, but instead some episode called ""The Best Clown in Town"". I don't know why Nickelodeon would choose to omit one of the best episodes they've aired from this new DVD."
5,Backyardingans Shakers,"Mother's, Fathers, Grandparents, & babysitters. The backyardingans provide good learning tips when you share with the child what is taken place. They share, care, get out and explore, and love to dance. My two yr grandbaby luv them and I enjoy watching them with her. They provide music from different backgrounds. So if you like country, rap, soul, pop ect they have it on one of the disc."
5,Grandkids love it,"Good quality, good children's show. It serves the purpose, the grandkids love it. It keeps them satisfied when we're traveling."
4,Original Coming-of-age tale,Sometimes I don't know what to say about a film because a plot summary would give too much away. This coming-of-age story seems fairly standard at first but has enough novel twists to be original. Good performances and cinematography are icing on the cake. My only compliant is the usual subtitle one: reading and watching a scene is not fun. The movie isn't rated but is probably PG-13 for adult situations and sexual themes but almost no nudity.
3,A disappointment,"A morose and depressed young man (Vaclav Neckar) takes a job in a Czech railway station during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. The boy (and everyone else for that matter) is preoccupied with sex as the world falls apart around them. Ultimately, this film left me unsatisfied. Neckar$B!G(Bs performance, though it may be appropriate for the character, is deadly dull. I found no precedent for the decision by him and his lecherous older co-worker (Vladimir Valenta) to join the underground movement and the climax arrives rather abruptly and anticlimactically. Having little emotional investment in the characters, I was left unaffected."
1,The Last Picture Show Meets Von Ryan's Express,"Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one. Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone. The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often."
5,YES,"It is among my favorites. Experimental, moving, genius, fun, and a bunch of other adjectives that I don't know how to say at this moment."
5,"Royal Pains, Season 1","This is a great show, with believable characters. We should all have such dedicated physicians like Dr. Hank Lawson. The good doctor, his brother Evan, and beautiful Physician's Assistant Divya make HankMed the concierge practice of choice for the lucky folk - rich or poor - in New York's Hamptons. Getting to know HankMed and the residents of the Hamptons make this series enjoyable. And after the last episode, you know you're going to miss these new friends and won't be able to wait for Season 2 to see them again."
5,GREAT SHOW,"If you're looking for thriller or suspense, look somewhere else. But if you're looking for a show that is laid back and relaxed, a rainy Saturday afternoon type of show, order Royal Pains. While the older brother is charming and smart, the younger brother in the show keeps you smiling and laughing (great humor). I personally love Royal Pains."
5,Very Enjoyable Show From USA Network And Universal,"This show probably ranks as one of the top three that USA network shows the other two of course being Burn Notice and Psych, and while there are other doctor shows out there this one with it's cast of talented actors and actress as well as special guests make it very enjoyable and worth checking out. While the first season only gives you twelve episodes the second season will give you more to wet your appetite with having eighteen episodes, and yes while there are a couple that aren't that great on whole the show will probably still entertain you and your family and friends."
5,"""Royal Pains"" is not a pain to watch!","I watched the entire first season over one weekend's time and I wished I had Season 2 already. All of the characters grow on you when you see the episodes in order. Each episode builds each character more and more with each new show builds on the previous show. I highly recommend this show as it has good working ethics, moral to the story, and the medical part is very believeable and real."
2,Royal Pains: Season One,"As a new series, an interesting trek when competing with the Medical TV series on offer. I would discribe him as a ""Macguyver"" Doctor who always comes through."
2,"Interesting, yet somewhat disappointing","I was slightly disappointed by the title. I've seen DV8 performing couple of times and their performances were entertaining, innovative and had a really good atmosphere.The DVD consists of 3 pieces, and they're shot for camera, not a performance recording.I think I had higher expectations, remembering the performances from a long time ago."
2,Seems to address children that have been wronged by a parent,"I was disappointed that this book only was geared toward helping adult children heal from a parent's abuse/estrangement. For me, my adult child has chosen to estrange herself from me. I bought this book after my heart has been breaking for 2 months. Each page that I desperately read, I was hoping to find help for a parent going through being cut off by a child. Each page I was disappointed that the book is geared the other way. Perhaps it is because the author was cut off by his parents and chooses to see the only side of a child being hurt."
4,Good Insights,"This book is helpful to those of us in similar estranged family situations, especially since it's a topic most are reluctant to talk about. Knowing others are dealing with the same issues was helpful."
5,Unbelieveably helpful,This book is more than a book. It is a healing tool. Not your typical self-help book. This really works.
5,Loved it,"This book kept you guessing and was very hard to put down! Just when you think nothing else can happen, it does. Started and finished all in the same day.There was a typo on the first page of the last chapter. The entire page was typed twice. But other than that I would sugest this book for anyone who is just looking for a good read."
5,Worth the wait!!!!!,"I read ""Past Tense"" and have been anxiously awaiting the birth of Della. I enjoyed it from page one until the end! I liked the way the story flowed from page to page. It kept me reading long past my bedtime. I hope Ms. Gettys has a new offering for us in the near future. I can't compare her writing to any other author, I think she has a style all her own....and I LIKE IT."
4,Unexpectedly good!,"I don't know why I had low expectations, but I was very impressed with this book. I loved how confident Della is. I definitely recommend it."
4,Good once I got going...,"Started slow for me - went off in several different directions and I had to stop and go back a few times to see where I was but when I hit ""that spot"" I could hardly put it aside.There were some things in the writing that needed some 'attention' but I would give this author another try."
3,fun quick read. great for the beach or during your commute,"This book was entertaining, and I think it would be good reading during your commute, or as a beach read. It's not terribly smart, but it's a good story, the plot development is pretty good and the writing is entertaining. I figured out the punchline pretty early (maybe the writer intended it), but it was fun to watch it play out. I generally prefer more developed characters and a thicker plot - but I still like this book for what it is. Quick, entertaining and interesting. It was heartwarming to watch Della grow throughout the book, too."
5,ahhhhhhmazing,"this game doesn't have the greatest graphics. it is 2d. but it is a fun game. but online is where all the fun begins. there is a huge comunity with all sorts of kids, clans, and home made levels. i have to say that it is my favorite game.ps. Join CC (cracco clan)"
5,NKOTB,Iam a Big NKOTB fan and Jordan Knight fan.. sure good to see the guys back again. I grew up with there music. good to see them back again. iam an 80s kid. a must for people grew up in the 80s and fans of NKOTB
4,National Geographic Collegiate Atlas of the World,"I found this Atlas very useful. When I research world events and specific areas that things are occurring in this atlas comes in handy. It is easy to use and the maps, graphs and other pertinent statistics are very readable. For quick reference I recommend this atlas."
1,I agree: There's a serious binding problem. Don't buy!,"I am making this review for the sake of bringing down the rating. To reiterate what other reviewers have already made clear, this atlas has a serious binding problem. If a location is at the center of a two-page map, its difficult, if not impossible, to see the location. This is because the tight binding forces the two pages too close together.On the spur of the moment, without access to amazon.com reviews, I bought this atlas at a bargain price at a new/used bookshop. It had a glossy attractive cover, and I had been wanting a more manageable atlas than my bulky ""Times Atlas of the World."" The ""Times Desktop Atlas of the World"" is much more mangeable than its big brother, but it has only 25,000 place names. The ""National Geographic Collegiate Atlas of the World"" has about 55,000 place names, but it has its binding problem.I give this a one-star review, because I believe this atlas is something you should not buy. The binding problem IS serious."
4,Completes The SNFU Trilogy,"Add this to your purchases of ""And No One Else Wanted To Play"" and ""If You Swear, You'll Catch No Fish"" and you can consider your SNFU collection complete.So much of the SNFU catalog is incomprehensibly awful, it's difficult to fathom that this mid-90s release could be worthwhile, let alone fantastic. And yet, it is fantastic. Here, the tracks occupy the realm of magnificence with refreshing consistency. There being only two throwaway tracks is, in and of itself, a remarkable accomplishment for post-IYSYCNF SNFU.That's what makes SNFU such a conundrum of a punk band. They have in their catalog some of the most brilliantly original and well-executed punk rock and the most embarrassing misfires of all time."
2,"modest heat reduction, distorted view","The film reduced heat vs. a plain window by about 10 degrees but Gila Titanium reduced it by 20 deg. Also, the film caused small wavy bumps on the glass that were noticable. Gila is smooth as glass (but Gila has a mirror effect). I am going to try Gila platinum to see if I can get the heat reduction without the noticable mirror effect."
1,Complete waste of money,"Out of the box, it seemed like this product should have been easy to install and use. The instructions for applying it were very simple. The problem is that it simply does not stick to the glass for more than a couple of hours. Perhaps it works better if you use it on small panes, but the 16""x50"" pieces I needed peeled off the windows in no time. Trying to reapply them was a even greater waste of time. Don't waste your money, find a better product!"
1,Waste of time and money,Don't buy.Made no difference.Waste if time and money.Just a transparent piece of plastic and no benefit.I want my money back!!!
4,A few pointers for installation,"I installed this product on a few different windows yesterday. So far it seems to be working well. A few installation suggestions:- Smaller windows are easier to work with than larger windows. If installing on multiple windows, start with the smaller ones first, so you can get the hang of aligning the film.- Remove the vinyl backing before applying the film to the window. Otherwise you will have to do twice the squeegeeing, which is slow and tedious."
1,Not worth it at any price...,Don't waste your time or money. I installed on west facing bedroom windows. It madeno difference in temperature at all. Also the visual clarity they talk about is a joke. It is cloudy and blurry even after several days. Spend a little more and buy a different brand.
4,An evolved RKL,"This I believe was a studio agreement CD. It did not have the classic grit of the RKL I grew to love. Don't get me wrong I love anything they do, as they always bucked the system and were an essential grindcore early bird. Check out Lagwagon from Let's Talk About Fellings on ... Chris from this band has now teamed up with them. Buy it cheap or used. Lastly buy Rock and Roll Nightmare on LP for all the great album candy ! Trip on !"
1,Used product supposed to be new,"The shocks came, they were rusted and old. They sat unlevel and still do. I had to use them immediately so I was screwed."
3,Beau and The Bloodied Cravat.....,"In this third Beau Brummell mystery, the story begins at Oatlands, The Duchess of York's country home. The Duchess is celebrating her birthday and Beau has bought a special present for her, one that his valet, Robinson, is bringing up in a separate carriage. Unfortunately, Robinson's carriage is set upon by highwaymen. The highwayman steal something precious to the Beau, something that, if brought to light, could ruin his life as well as The Duchess'.The Bloodied Cravat was enjoyable, though not as good as books one and two in the series. Beau's a bit ""off his game"" in this story, though rightly so as what is happening to him. Once Mr Lavender and his daughter Lydia enter the story it picks up the pace again. I enjoy Beau's relationship with Lydia, and hope it continues in book 4.I would still recommend The Bloodied Cravat for fans of Historical Mystery and Regency period enthusiasts.3 stars."
3,Getting Better and Better,"This series is improving with each book.After reading the first one I said I would never read another in the series. But never say never (when your stuck in an airport desperate for reading material the definition of never changes a bit).The cat is still annoying, but this book was a great improvement over the first and the second (which I went back and read hoping it would be as interesting as third - it wasn't)"
2,Read this in a quiet place,I had to read this book for a history course. I would suggest to everyone who reads this book to do so in a quiet place with no distractions. Keep a dictionary handy. There is so much information that you should read this one section at a time. For those of you doing a research project it is a good book to have. Lots of interesting statistics but not fun to read.
4,Worth the Price of Admission,"You are going to get 36 songs interpreted by the resonant bass voice of this Sonoran singer. The music on this CD isn't particualarly historic - it mostly contains Spanish versions of Hollywood & Italian ballads from the 50's & 60's (The Shadow of Your Smile, Ebb Tide, Strangers in the Night, Bambina Bambina) - it does contain some Mexican standards performed in a memorable way such as a Jazz version of ""Nocturnal"" and the best versions of ""Cuando Calienta el Sol, ""Yo Sin Ti,"" & ""Cuando Brilla la Luna."" This music, while not particularly revolutionary, is much better than the tedious ballads of the 80's & 90's."
4,CO2 Wine bottle opener,"This is a fantastic, effortless cork popper. However, make sure you have a traditional corkscrew for a backup. It does not work on all corks. At first I thought that it just didn't work on synthetic corks but have since found that not to be true so I'm not sure why. But when it does work, it is great."
5,Fun and Fast,"I love this product. It opens regular and plastic corks. It's not only a quick, mess free way to open any bottle but it's also fun to do! Makes a great gift."
1,Don't waste your money,"This wine opener is NOT easy to use. You have to press hard to insert the needle into the cork, especially the plastic corks. If the opener/needle slips while you're attempting to push it in, you risk injury. You must press HARD on the top button to get the cork to eject, which it eventually does -- as a projectile -- spraying wine everywhere. A towel is mandatory. I'm very disappointed with this product."
4,Easy to open a bottle of wine with this opener but be careful,Wine corks come out very easily with a tiny little push of your finger. If you push too hard the air will make the cork come flying out. I bought this one for a friend because I love mine so much. Recommend.
4,A little hard to operate,"My wife wanted this to open wine bottles for her, but we find it a bit hard to stuff the needle into the cork. It feels like you're going to bend the needle or jab yourself with it. Once in, it works pretty well, but frankly I will most likely buy her one of the battery powered removers soon."
5,Cork Pops,We have purchased several of these wine openers for friends and family over the past few years. It makes opening wine bottles so very easy.
5,Great item,"Worked better than I thought, great wine opener really pops the cork out of the bottle,will be buying more for gifts."
4,Easiest opener ever,"The Pop N Cork pushes out the cork with a little wiggle. I was a little reluctant to use it at first - intimidated by pushing the hypodermic-like needle into the cork, but I now use it regularly. It makes such a happy sound when the cork pops out.It is certainly more expensive than mechanical openers and it does need replacement cartridges but it's ""wow"" value is high and the dang thing just flat out works.Keep it FAR from children."
4,As Expected,"This is the second one I have purchased. Simple to use, simple to change CO2 cartridges."
3,1.5 litre,"This probably works great. I would have appreciated knowing that is not for use on 1.5 litre bottles since the person I gave it to frequently buys wine of that sort. After unwrapping it, she read the small print on the bottom and it has probably been regifted by now."
3,Needle gets bent Requires dexterity to minimize,"I have had my Cork Pops Original for 10-15 years. I bought it for the same reason many do, to prevent broken corks from being dropped into the bottle, and the WOW factor. It has been enjoyable and simple to use but it has one problem, the needle is prone to bending. I have had issues with it being hard to press into very firm corks, which causes(creates more)bending, which causes it to be very important in your insertion technique. I am ordering new needles which I believe(hope)have the features of the new ""legacy"" model(graphite coated needle). The websites do not describe it having the graphite coated needle but I would expect it is now the standard they would be trying to achieve. any better than that."
2,"Works, but only barely!","The Cork Pops device opened about 4-5 bottles of wine, and then the gas was gone. The 'trigger' mechanism is difficult to manipulate (push down) so that it works. It is an excellent idea for removing corks which tear apart from a more traditional corkscrew provided the gas hasn't leaked out or whatever is causing the problem of only getting a few bottles of wine to open."
3,product great--company shipping terrible,This opener is great--we have one so I ordered these for Christmas gifts. Placed order on December 11th--they sent e-mail saying product was shipped on the 13th. Did not receive the product till January 15th--to late for Christmas so now I'm stuck with them for a year. Very disappointed with the company.
5,The Jewel Garden,"I love this book. The story of the Dons life and gardens is riveting. I like Monty Dons honesty and forthrightness. They both work very hard and the results in the jewel garden are stunning.The photos are excellent and inspiring. Also when you read about a particular part of the garden, there is always a photo of it, which I really like."
2,works but not great,I bought this to replace my older Libman which was getting kind of nasty. This is a different design. The bristles are not as strong as my older one and less able to scrape pots with. The plastic scraper is decent but it is difficult to get into corners of pots. All in all I prefer the older one and have had to keep both around.
5,great,Great. Use it to wash my cast iron. Nice comefortable handle with great scraper and bristles. Def a good buy.
2,Does not clean thin spout Nalgene,I thought it would fit in the opening of the Nalgene to clean it...it doesn't. No curved bristles around the head mean less ways to use it in my opinion.
4,gives releif,"I have a stiff back. With the use of this product, the stiffness subsided. I would recomend for arthritis pain."
5,muscle and arthritis pain soother,"have used this product for years. no odor, no greasy film and it relieves pain in my joints and muscles without fail. tired of taking prescription pain pills that end up messing with your liver and kidneys."
5,great stuff!,"This product is amazing! I highly recommend it for arthritis sufferers, carpal tunnel, bad knee, any ach or pain!Aslo, great for shoulder pain, as well as lower back pain."
2,TOPRICIN,"I BOUGHT ON THE RECOMENDATION OF A FRIEND.I APPLIED THE CREAM AS A WAS SUPPOSED TO.THE PRODUCT HAS NOT HELPED ME IN ANY WAYEXCEPRT ,MONEY I SPENT WAS NOT WELL SPENT."
3,didn't help with pain in my knees but helped my neck pain,"I have severe rheumatoid arthritis in my knees and I don't feel that Topricin helped the pain in my knees. But when I put some on my neck, where I had throbbing pain from severe spinal disease, it helped stop the pain soon after. Topricin may help some and may be worth trying."
5,Cream,Works pretty goodI have fibromyalgia and it helps with the pain from that helps with quite a few problem I have would recommend this product to people with arthritis as well as any other joint or muscle problem it works
1,save your money,"Might work for someone that just has a slight sore spots, but didn't do anything for me. I guess I'm to far gone."
5,It really does work!,"I originally bought this cream for my boyfriend who strained his wrist while exercising. Just as advertised, he began feeling better within 20 minutes. It has absolutely no smell and absorbs pretty quickly."
4,Very good Product,"I like Topricin very much. It is effective but does not have lasting effects alone but coupled with over the counter pain killers it does the job. I use it mainly when I get up in the morning before taking any meds, occasionally during the day, and it works well."
4,great product!,"A doctor recommended this cream to me for muscle pain. It works great as well as being fragrance free, and non-greasy. I don't have to worry about it rubbing off onto my clothing. I just wish it was less expensive, it's hard to find in stores in my area."
3,Works OK,"I bought this product on the recommendation of a friend. I was suffering for months from plantar fasciitis. I rubbed it over my heel and arch at bedtime and wore socks. It did help somewhat. Recently, I used it when I pulled a muscle in my back and it sorta helped but not a lot. Do not put it on broken skin - it is very painful."
2,Didn't help at all.,It came highly recommended by several people. I just happened to be one that it had no effect on. It doesn't mean it won't work for others.
1,Topricin,I had read that this product worked on feet that burns and t's in pain. It doesn't even touch it and acts like lotion. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has any type of pain. I have other areas of pain and it didn't work for that either.Topricin Cream 4 Ounces
1,Not impressed,I have used this product for over 2 weeks now and haven't noticed any change or improvement in my arthritic condition or pain. Don't feel it works for me.
1,"sadly, doesn't work","I certainly wanted Topricin to work on my hamstring origin tendon injury. But after 4 applications a day for a week, it had no detectable effect on my pain. I'm afraid it's just snake oil. Avoid this product and its dubious claims."
4,Works most of the time,"I use this when I am having tense shoulders or a headache coming on. A lot of the time I use it it will get the job done. However there are certain times when I use it and it doesn't seem to phase the pain. It could be due to the severity of it however, I always want to keep a bottle of this around to use, its a much healthier solution than reaching for the ibuprofen bottle.Keep this in your cabinet for your first option, it usually starts working for me very quickly, within 10-15 minutes. If it doesn't get the trick done, then go onto your heavier artillery."
3,Topricin for back pain,"I ordered the cream, easier to use than a lotion. It does pretty well to lessen the sharpness of back pain. Takes awhile to perceive any change. By rubbing it in on lower back, hands get the benefit, too, if they have some arthritis. Nothing takes away the pain entirely, but this seems to be a help. I may buy more when this is used up."
5,Works faster and better than anything else.,I have tried a wide variety of products to treat muscle pain. This one works best. The previous leader was Tiger Balm.
2,Does not work,"It is easy to apply, does not smell, but unfortunately did not relieve the pain.My wife tried it as well and it did not help relieve her pain either"
1,"Placebo, at best","Have chronic shoulder pain which was diagnosed as an inflamed tendon in my rotator cuff. The product provided no relief whatsoever. I also have a minor problem with my achilles tendon that becomes tender after longer runs. Again, I felt no difference whatsoever from using this cream."
3,don't know,I haven't had an opportunity to use this product. My sister told me it was an excellent product so I bought it to try in the future.
4,Academic but good,I can't help but think that Dan's writing style is fairly academic. However the book is pretty good. He's addressing tough topics that are original and thought-provoking.
3,A Little Disappointed,"Bold Love is a hard read. I expected it to be easier to read. The book has great points, but i find myself reading it over and over again to get the full meaning."
3,a few nice spots,The book is okay and has a few good quotes that I underlined but as a whole the book was disappointing.
3,Discussion Guide,This sits right next to the book. It is for counseling purposes and is valued as a resource for those who need it.
3,Great wipes but not the ones in the picture,These wipes are great but when i ordered these I looked at the picture and figured hey those r the ones i always use. But.......when they were delivered they were actually Pull-ups wipes. The reason why it made a difference to me was because i normally buy the huggies clean team and i like them because they are not perforated every wipe is seperate. But the ones that came were perforated and attached
4,good flushable wipes,"These are good for potty training, but they are pretty perfume-y smelling. I don't think they offer them in an unscented variety, but that would be better for me. Why risk irritating little bums with unnecessary perfumes?"
5,Great for the whole family,I especially like the Pull Ups Wipes because they are a bit thicker than other similar products and make you clean and feel fresh.
5,Good wipes,"Good flushable wipes for kids to use in the bathroom. They are smaller and thinner than regular baby wipes. The scent isnt too strong, to sweet or too perfumy."
5,Great Deal,"Just what I expected, and at a great price. Cheaper than buying smaller packages in store. I'm all stocked up for a while now!"
5,Great product!!,"Great product, dependable, reliable and most of all flushable, have been using for 3 years never had a problem, two thumbs up Huggies !!"
1,"Has potential, but not quite there","This product could be a really great medium of art, but it's too cheap. For one, it has no flash, which forces you to look out for sunny days to use it. Secondly, it broke on me during my second role of film. Not too surprising, being that it is made of cheap plastic. Invest in a lomo camera with a flash and durability."
1,Unreliable,"Although i absolutely love the lomo effect, my review is all bad!!I git the first one and it stopped after one film. Then i exchanged it, and the film almist got suck again and the roller wasnt working.I think they are all defective!Theyre not that expensive though, so its kind of ok. But you have to know that this cam wont last very long, maybe for 3 films or so...But the problem is, lomo shops wont fix it! I asked one in soho, and they told me that id rather buy a new one than fixing this one, because theyre cheap."
4,Really fun,"Other than being a little wary of its toy-like plastic and the lack of flash, I have no complaints about this camera. I highly recommend it to anyone who is into experimentation and is willing to try different things. I've had results ranging from ""What on earth is that burry mess repeated 8 times?"" to beautiful scenes I never expected to come out of this ugly red brick."
1,happiness to horrible,"I was SO excited to get my Oktomat in the mail and after a weeks' worth of waiting, my wait was over. However, the film reel was made a tad bit too short on my make, so of course the entire camera wouldn't work! I wasted at least 3 rolls of 35mm film trying to make it work, but it never did. I say don't waste your money. Lomography is great, but paying this much for a plastic piece of unoperating junk is not worth it."
1,Buy at your own risk.,I bought this camera brand new in a retail box. First roll of film and it is already struggling mightily to work. The teeth slip off the roll because the flimsy gears are not strong enough to even pull the roll. I finally figured out after wasting a few frames a way to carefully advance the film without the gears letting go. This product is made at a level of a claw-machine toy. There is flat out no excuse for the Lomo company to charge $40 for this item. I totally respect what they have done for the Lomo movement and everything but this is not the way to do it. This product will alienate people from the movement; it is that bad. Go ahead and buy it and you will see what I am talking about. Save your money and buy a genuine Lomo antique from an online auction site.
1,It simply doesn't function.,"I bought this camera to have some fun, and try a few ideas I've had. I was really excited, I've had experience with toys cameras, like Holga and the Diana F+ Mini and enjoyed their unpredictability and spontaneity. However, the Oktomat never produced a single picture. Out of the box, the gears weren't winding properly and my film wasn't latching onto the gears properly. After about 20 shots of my 36 roll of film, the camera ceased to advanced or set of the shutter when I pressed the shutter release button. Not even one roll of film ended up coming out. A real disappointment. I mean I understand it's a toy, but really lomo? $40 for a toy that simply doesn't function?!?! Save yourself the time, money, and hassle. Do Not buy this piece of hipster plastic."
5,huffin,gas huffer is one of the most under rated bands of all times there music is a work of genus this is a must buy for any rock fan who loves good music and who wants a change of pace.
5,Complete Chretien,"This book has the chapters listed by others, and also ""The Story of the Grail"". Knowing this beforehand would have saved me from buying a separate book on Parsifal. Every story in the book is written in prose so if you want a poem format you'll need get books of that kind. I just started reading this book and am totally satisfied with it so far. A good one stop book for all your Chretien needs."
2,"Nice, but not useful to the advanced collector.","It was great to finally see a book written on Tarzan collectibles, but this one falls short. While many fine older collectibles are shown from the collections of Michael Conran and George McWhorter, it would appear that the author had very little in his own collection, and seemed to ""pad"" the book with pages of common collectibles. There are tons of vintage items that could have been shown that were sacrificied to show multiple pages of new trading cards, new paperbacks & new comic books. Still a nice book for a collection, though.Schiffer produced a book on Oz memorabilia a few years ago, which was written by three major Oz collectors. Because the collectors knew their stuff, it turned out to be a fantastic reference book - very hard to top. Schiffer should have followed this same formula and consulted more long-time collectors to write a book on Tarzan collectibles."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"but my critical thinking got the better of me. I agree with Heyward's stance on inclusiveness within the church, and the importance of not letting our concepts of Christ get the better of us, but she seems to have left Christianity entirely behind, or worse, used isolated Christian terms for their cultural weight while reinventing them to suit her own personal agenda. Her Christianity relates not to church or the story of Jesus, even in an allegorical sense, but to the wispy New Age mysticism that reduces religion to nonsensical abstract terms with no reality or practicality to them at all. Her spirit is fluffy and her flesh is entirely absent."
1,Christianity unplugged,Christianity is so rethought here that there's nothing left. Scripture's too patriarchal. The Eucharist is too traditional. The Book of Common Prayer is too Eurocentric. What is left is a series of vaguely leftist bumper stickers. Even the four virtues seem to have collapsed!
1,Not 'Kosher',"A note to browsers.....this book does not represent the views of the faithful in the Episcopal Church, of which Ms. Heyward is a member of the clergy. Rather than a biblically revealed doctrine of Jesus Christ, it is an exercise in Panentheism and imaginative pseudo-theology. I give it one star only because zero stars was not an option offered."
4,Good but to sensitive for outside/windy street,"Mic. is too sens. in windy street conditions, inside it is perfect. If you talk a lot something like 40-70 min/day, battery will last about 1-1.5 days.Cons: cant leave it on a charger for all night, it will kill battery within 1-2 months."
4,Close but no cigar . . .,"I bought an HDW-2 three years ago but returned it almost immediately because of various problems.I bought an HDW-3 over a year ago and like it except for two primary issues.First, it is impossible to use outside because the wind drowns out the communication.Second, the the large earpiece broke--not the electronics, just the plastic attachment--and Nokia customer service tells me ""the earloop for your Nokia HDW-3 Wireless Headset is not a user-replaceable part and is not available for sale or to send out."" Egads--I have to buy a whole new unit!"
5,A GREAT ENGLISH BOOK,This is a great book for when I do projects and research papers. It has grammar and bibliographic information which helps me to do correct term papers. I am 12 years old which makes it easier for me to find things. The best thing about this book is that you don't have to hassle to find a piece of writing information when it is all in one book.
5,SOOOO HAPPY,"This was the greatest idea ever! I was thrilled when I found this DVD, I gave it as a 30th birthday gift, because these are the cartoons my friend grew up watching. Great product."
3,80s cartoons,"It was ok, it seemed more cool to watch when I was a kid now it didn't seem all that great anymore. The only cartoons I thought that were still cool to look at were Chuck Norris and Mr.T other than that it wasn't worth the money. I end up selling the cartoon to a kid's parents."
2,Not Quite Worth The Money,"I fondly remember lots of action packed 80's cartoons such as Thundarr, Mr. T, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, Laser Tag, The Super Friends... I was very disappointed in this set. This is definitely a bait & switch kinda thing. The box doesn't tell you how many episodes of each cartoon are on it. It contained only one of episode of Thudarr, one episode of Mr. T, one episode of Chuck Norris while being loaded with several episodes of the Flintsone Kids and some other cartoon I've never heard of called ""Kwiky The Kowala"". I would pay $20 for several episodes of Thundarr, but not Kwiky The Kowala! However there are some other lost jewels on it."
2,Warner Brother Dorks.!....,"....the bean counters were not even around when the 60's, 70's and 80's toons were aired..they have no clue.!..Pay Maltin or Beck to package this stuff..cause you suck at it.!!"
1,More Thundarr!!!,"Forget Mr. T! Warner Video listen!!!! Put out a complete Thundarr The Barbarian set with awesome extras and you will make a killing! Plus, by releasing legal version of Thundarr you will make all those low quality bootlegs absolete! Do it! Soon!"
3,is this really the only way to get Mr. T on DVD?,"I'm a big fan of the 80s ""Mr. T"" cartoon series, which I'd describe as A-Team meets Scooby-Doo. I'm hoping this DVD isn't the only way to get these episodes, which would be very unfortunate IMO."
5,Now these are Cartoons!,"All these cartoons take me back to when Saturday mornings used to be fun. Next to Thundercats and He-man/She-ra lies Mr.T Animated Series. I wish they would release the whole series on DVD, I am sure Mr. T himself would appreciate it as well. Other than just the one episode of Mr. T, it has a bunch of others that I absolutely remember watching, including but not limited to, the Flintstone Kids. Amazing. Now if they just added the snorks, life would be grand."
4,Delighted my husband and son alike,I bought this for my 32-year-old husband for Christmas. He and his 5-year-old son were equally thrilled. Great selection of cartoons including some we had forgotten about. We only wish the DVD's were longer/had more content - maybe more than one episode of each show?
5,Great book for younger kids...,"I remember reading this when I was little - I just recently found it in my parents' basement. I brought it in for my kids at school, and it works great. (I'm a music teacher.) We are singing ""There Was an Old Lady who Swallowed a Fly,"" and this is the same form, building on what came before it. The kids really loved it and could ""read"" along with me after the first page. I even had them figure out the rhyme without telling them, and they were really proud that they could do it. I wish it were still in print, but I guess that means I just have to hold tight to my copy of it!"
1,stop mixing contexts...,"why are you reviewers trying to disguise the fact that all this ""modern"" cellists ( yo-yo ma, rostropovitch, and so on) are doing a good job playing very heavy an too romantic cellos?...imagine tchaikowsky?s violin concerto performed on a baroque violin, with messa di voce,short stroke bowing, baroque ornaments and tempi!!!!.... so this guys are doing the other way around...all this performances were born dead...these works came alive on a particular sound and permormance fashion by bach?s genius, every thing that goes beyond this simple bases are lost."
4,2 disc set of Ricky Gervais Live 1 & 2 (NOT REGION FREE),"This DVD set was released in the UK, it contains 2 exceptionally funny standup routines by David Brent himself RICKY GERVAIS. (THESE DISCS WILL ONLY PLAY IN REGION FREE PLAYER HERE IN THE STATES)Animals is 78 mins of live standup some of it concerning animals, there is also a 20 + min doc on the filming of the special with STEPHEN MERCHANT interviewing Ricky, and a commmentary track.Politics (68 mins) showcases a slighty more streamlined and hipper Ricky than Animals, and suffers lightly from this slicker RG, it is still funny as you please however. The extras on Politics are lengthier and funnier particularly the 19 min with Karl Pilkington, he is hilarious to listen to on Ricky's podcasts but even funnier to look at (him and his little freak book) Also very funny is Robin Ince and Rickys commentary track.A nice deal for the standup/Ricky G. fan just make sure you have the means to watch it if you are on this side of the pond."
1,Disappointed- but not in Ricky Gervais.,"I'm not sure how this product is b/c it didn't work when I received it, but I have to say I love Amazon but am very frustrated with this Marketplace seller (Caiman). They have absolutely the worst customer service I have dealt with. This DVD does not work on most US DVD players- there are region limitations. This was not mentioned anywhere (probably should be) so when I received the DVD I was extremely disappointed to find out I couldn't watch it. And I was really looking forward to it b/c I am a HUGE Ricky Gervais fan. So after complaining to Caiman, I got authorized to return it, which I did, and they did not crdt me for the $90 DVD. I can't really blame this on Amazon- I have always had great service from them. I'm just extremely disappointed and would never purchase from Caiman again."
5,Great help for teens of all ages!,I thought the book was very informative and useful. It was helpful because of how it was organized. For each year in high school there was a list of things to do. I would really recommend this book to anyone planning on going to college!! Enjoy!
1,Don't buy it from e-city,The guys from E-City just deliver the scanner with no CD Roms for installation and no USB cable. I paid US$ 300 for a scanner I cannot use.
4,Excellent reference book for non-programmers,"This book can be included in the handy tool category, a ""must have"" for non-programmers who want to give their Excel applications a professional look as well as get the most out of Excel without wasting much time and effort. Word of caution, a bit of familiarity with visual basic as a language and the controls etc. will be very helpful in using this book. Codes in the CD are very helpful. It is written by a practicing professional from usage point of view hence a very easy reading book and not heavy on the jargons of object oriented programming etc. I learned a lot of useful tricks after going through the book."
4,A helpful reference for any level,It has been a great reference. It has saved me many hours of digging through the Excel Help screens. The book is layed out well.
5,Consistently Rated Number 1 for Serious Excel Users,John Walkenbach is consistently rated the Number 1 writer on Excel and this latest edition fully justifies that rating. It's rare that an author can combine a fluid and easily readable text at this level of expertise. Hundreds of easily understandable examples. Builds up the basic principles and empowers further development. A compulsory reference with clearly marked differences between Excel 2002 and earlier versions. Beginners should buy John Walkenbach's Excel Bible Gold Edition first.
2,Constantly Broken,This is the second one I purchased and it broke again. Love the idea but it just doesn't work. Too bad it seemed great.
1,not good,"It is old, incomplete and incapable of keeping up with today's hardware. Even then, years ago it was glitchy, full of bugs and crashing. If you think of red hat, get fedora or centos because today's real Enterprise Red Hat is very expensive and completely different from this one. Get Fedora, on a moment of writing Fedora 13 is the newest."
