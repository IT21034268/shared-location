1,Dont get this!,"I got this item only because it's supposed to be a quick detach riser, but it's not. On the box it says that it is as well, but theres no way you can detach it in less than 60 seconds. For the money that I spent, I could have bought 2 of the regular raisers and been more pleased than what what I am with this piece of garbage!"
3,hmmm,"it does what it says it will do. the software is basic and boring, if you have more money buy something else.. if you don't have more money this will do but the limited software that comes with it, is rrrreeeaaallllyyyyy boring.... after a while.."
3,my thoughts on the book,the cover page has a dedication written on it and I would have liked to have known that ahead of time..
5,Rev it up! Get the Suzuki the outta the garage.,"Not much to say really if you like garage rock (modern or 60's style), alternative stuff well you'll probably get off on this. No duds, no filler, no problems straight ahead good time rock 'n'roll of the highest order. This is their best stuff and it's shame they changed direction and got lost down a one way street. Well at least they still left this as their true testimony. A great party rockin' CD what more can you ask for?"
3,computer game,I expected more educational with musical toy. It was my fault that I chose this one. This is more like computer game for a young kid. It should be fun though. I will not let my kid play with this.
3,Better deals at Costco!,"I just purchased this Dora globe at Costco for $4.97! Amazon is really reasonable most of the time, but I was shocked to see how much they are trying to sell this for. It pays to shop around!"
2,disappointed in VTech,"The globe seems well made, but we wouldn't know yet. VTech DOES NOT INCLUDE the adaptor to plug the toy in w/ the purchase. How disappointing to NOT be able to play w/ your toy on Christmas, b/c VTech is too stingy to include something crucial to playing with this toy. I never heard of anything like this. You know Fisher Price, Little Tikes, Hasbro, etc... wouldn't skimp on a vital piece of their toys. Sorry to say we will never buy another VTECH toy again especially since they certainly don't make it clear that this part ISN'T included. They conveniently leave that info out!!! There are plenty of other game/computer companies out there to buy from!"
2,Text is thorough but work examples are garish.,"The text of the book broadly covers handcoloring techniques and products well. The subtle nature of the process, however, is entirely lost in the garish examples pictured. Another book, The Art of Handpainting Photographs by Cheryl Machat Dorskind, is both thorough and beautifully portrays the subtle to intense use of the medium."
2,Vague Technical Information ~ Better Books on the Market,"This book covers many different type of photo coloring techniques, however it provides little detail for these techniques. If you are interested in using photo oils, this is not the book to purchase. Better technical information on photo oils can be found in books by Kreb or Dorskind, with a lot more useful illustrations and step-by-step instruction. If interested in pastels or water color (which I was not), this may be a book to utilize. However, I would recommend looking it at the library first, before making a purchase. I was very disappointed with this purchase."
4,Good Book,"As with most books of this genre, it is a bit dated but has interesting information and good explanations."
5,A comment on Yo-Yo!,"This offer is a fabulous chance for those who are not familiar with Yo-Yo Ma to get in touch with some of his best recent works. I am a cellist myself and I love listening to these albums. Yo-Yo hurdles over all technical difficulties and brings you straight to the music, and most of all, his deep passion for music and the desire to share it with people abroad is obvious.This set of albums is not just your average classical music. I experienced many different kinds of works while listening to the albums, and found that they consist of various styles of music. I would strongly recommend this set to anyone that has not heard Yo-Yo Ma's playing before, as well as to those that have even gone to his recitals. To me, this was definately a good ivestment."
2,Not very easy to work with...,"The idea is good, but not completely thought out. The broad flat insulation around the wires plays havoc with a normal wire stripper, and if you were actually going to use all of the wire, there isn't nearly enough wall achors included with it to do the job. Being flat, it is very awkward and difficult to make a flat 90 degree turn, and the wire twists like a garden hose between anchors, instead of laying flat against the wall as it is supposed to.If you really want your speaker wire to not be seen, then it needs to be run up inside the wall into the attic and across and back down inside the other wall and wired to a speaker terminal. Otherwise, I think it's better to not pay so much, and just buy normal speaker wire that can be hidden along the baseboard under the carpet - or behind the floor wall trim, and alongside a door frame, etc."
2,Not as expected,"It is flat, but large. Regular 16 gauge wire is less noticeable. I would up not even using it."
3,Not exactly flat,"This cable is not perfectly flat. I put it underneath the carpet and the padding below. Without specifically looking for it, I do not notice the cable. However, if I try to feel for it, I can find it every time. But it's getting the job done, and if I don't notice it in every day usage, then it's working fine."
5,Good cable,The cable itself is great. Very flat and easy to hide. The speaker connectors that came with it aren't that great. They are not extremely easy to put on. The seller delivered my item in a good time. No complaints there.
2,what a bummer,"well, unfortunately this is another of those items that you buy with high hopes, but it ends up just taking up space in the closet... issues i have with it:1. it moves around when i'm trying to get the sleeve on it (i need a couple more hands)2. due to the location of the stand, i'm unable to get the whole sleeve onto the board, so really you can only do the end of the sleeve.I tried using it twice and gave up. it's not worth the extra time it takes just to do one tiny part of the sleeves."
1,poor construction,"While I expected a lower-quality item for a total of $7.00, I didn't expect the bolts holding it together to come out of the board the first time I used it."
3,Polder sleeve review,Product as expected except without RED grid cover. I had lost an identical product in a recent move so wonder why the red cover is now white?
1,Never filtered my water,Dont recommend this filter. It did not filter and remove impurities at all. Waste of money.
4,"A VERY NICE BALLAD, ESPECIALLY AT WEDDINGS","I am a great fan of Betsy!! I like this song, especially the chorus, but not as much as her other vocal selections from her downloads. The sound is good. They should play this song on one of those reality shows, like THE BACHELOR. There are two singers, male and female, and both are good. I just love HEATHER BLAIR JONES!"
1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED!,"I love Curve Soul but this is not it! I totally requested a refund. It smells like regular Curve, a fragrance that I do not like."
4,Review of Lisle 31310 double flaring tool,"This is a well made product, incorporating improvements from previous no name units i have owned. Both the tubing holder and the flaring tool require a wrench to tighten, eliminating the wing nuts and bar that always seems to bend and or break. The base of the flaring tool is heavy, to prevent bending."
1,Just plain bad,"This product is not capable of making double flares for brake lines. I've tried to make at least 25 flares using 3/16"" brake line with this thing and all of them were uneven and lopsided. I had a friend try and he had the same result. The brake line was properly prepared before each flaring attempt. Very disappointed, but you get what you pay for."
4,Bobby Vee - Essential & Collectable,"I was very imopressed with this CD it had more memorable songs on it than I thought, I was looking for ""The night has a thousand eyes"" but I got much more. I really like it."
4,Great Collection,"I think this collection is pure Bobby Vee. Although I'm not familiar with all of the recordings, I like 95% of the new ones. It evoked a lot of memories."
3,Shure,I haven't done the Bobby pins yet but the creative marble is my favoritebut it's really just glass marbles with small sticker magnets that when finished with painting you can stick in the back.The Origami paper can be frustrating especially for children.When I was little I loved Window art but I don't remember that it had to dry for a very long time..The boxes are very small but that's good for storage.My creative marble set's paint was dried out so I used paint that I already had home.
3,This book is an academic paper on the trilogy,"For the benefit of the people who are reading these reviews, this book is a research paper on the trilogy, NOT the trilogy itself. It's a worthwhile read, but if you're going to write a review on the Amazon.com website (like the first 2 reviews) make sure you write it about Senior's work, not Donaldson's!!!"
2,An over analysis of a great work.,"I really like the Covenant series, and so I picked this book up to see how others reacted to it. What I found was a work that read far to much into Donaldson's work, missed some major points, and committed simple errors (such as which hand Covenant had fingers amputated from). Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of lit.crit., but I found this text very dense to work through, and Senior came across as trying too hard to make his points."
3,Canon Photo Paper Pro- 1 Year Later,"..Stored in 8x10 vinyl binders and page protectors. I made the prints with at least one inch white borders, the one edge exposed to the air has yellowed up to about 1/2 inch in. The rest of the paper has remained unchanged and the image itself appears unchanged. 5x7 prints with no exposed edges have no yellowing....Black and white darkroom RC prints in the same binder...snow white EDGES!!!I am still keeping that B&W darkroom...."
3,I think you have to use it for a while to see the results.,We got it at a recommendation by our homeopath for our 3 year old. To help with her hair growth and to better quality of her nails. We some some changes but not too much. Probably gave it to her for 3 weeks or so. Perhaps I should have given it a longer run.
2,I needed two copies as gifts,I feel that over $100. a copy for each of two paperback books is much too expensive and I feel cheated. What else can I say?
1,High school project?,"I bought this book with pretty high hopes and was very disappointed. I think the reviews I saw on-line must have been submitted by the publisher and/or authors. If this book cost $1.25 it would have been priced right. It is basically a collection of little statements and/or facts that are supposed to make you feel better. Some are as short as one sentance ... saying something like ""gas is on average $1.50 per gallon cheaper in the US than in Europe"" ... hmmm, I'm feeling better already!?!"
5,98 Year Old Marathon Runner,"Just got this book after hearing an interview with the authors in Toronto, Canada. Now I feel guilty if I complain about anything! Especially after reading about the 98 year old man who ran a marathon (that's 26+ miles). Inspiring!"
1,Why would anyone read this?,"This is one of the worst ""books"" (if you can call it a book!!) that I have ever read!! It's pointless, meaningless drivel that a sixth grader could have written. Maybe the authors are in sixth grade? One of the authors, Beth Jannery, claims to be a writer. This isn't writing! Don't waste your money!"
4,Lappac 5 Carrying Case- Targus CL55,"If you have a Sony Vaio with the 16.1"" screen, this is the laptop case for you. It is lightweight and that will help since the Sony GRX series already weighs 8 lbs. There aren't many cases that will fit the 14""x11.5"" dimensions of the Sony PCG-GRX laptops. Targus also makes a leather case which is very nice but it is quite a bit heavier. The fabric is very durable and it should hold up for years."
4,One thing more...,"You can see, from the dimension I presented below, that it's of the same width and height as Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia(Small Size). To make a jacket for the BHS and this booklet would be a good idea to keep them together."
3,"A Simplified Guide to Bhs: Critical Apparatus, Masora, Accents, Unusual Letters & Other Markings","Book is useful, but the 4th Edition does not have a guide to the Latin abbreviations, which I find crucial to understanding the text notes. The 3rd Edition had a key, but for some reason the editors thought it was ok to take it out. It's been a long time since I've taken Latin. Hebrew is difficult enough. Hopefully the 5th Edition will include the much needed guide."
1,very disapointed!,"I cannot believe I spent money on this tape! One of the worst dance videos I have ever seen. I did not like Ms Eva Amadoris's personality. It is pissing me off when she keeps saying: ""Reina, show THEM..."" Music is boring. And who filmed this? Some amateur? Plus, how is anyone going to learn the steps if the dancers make a lot of missteps in their own choreography? I was very diappointed in this video. If you want to learn flamenco go to the flamenco class."
1,This video is a disgrace for flamenco,"The people who put this together are students, and I have seen many other students better than these people. They have no technique and certainly no style. They spend about 15 minutes to show some basic footsteps and then the rest of the video is clips of them doing their gigs!You got to have some nerve making a video like this. The distributor should pull this off the shelves and tell these people to go take some lessons.This is what I call an abuse of the beautiful art of flamenco.PS: I didn't buy this, I rented it from Netflix thinking it was a flamenco guitar instruction video."
1,Buying this is a waste of time and money!,"Don't waste your money! PLEASE! If I had the opportunity, I would not give this dvd any stars. Not to sound so emotional but this is horrible! What a rip off!"
3,"Great photos, outdated and questionable info","This is the first National Geographic travel guide I have used. I am new to AZ and thought this would give me a good idea of places to go and things to do. While it has been very useful at times, a LOT of the information has been inaccurate and/or outdated. Also, some of the featured places have hardly been worth stopping by, let along making a specific trip to see. I would strongly recommend first checking this out at the library or a bookstore to see if it is really what you want."
3,Not as good as it should be.,"As a huge fan of HBO's Band of Brothers miniseries, I was disappointed in this calendar. The photo selection is odd - some are lifted directly from the show, others depict scenes that didn't make the final cut of the movie. A few pictures show the men of Easy Company that viewers came to know and love, but others are of unrecognizable strangers. Some key dates in the history of Easy Company's participation in World War II are marked on the montly calendar, but others are missing, and the pictures selected for each month don't correlate to the events that happened in that month. I am such a huge fan that I will keep it and use it, but I'm disappointed that the editors didn't make an effort consistent with the quality of the show. Guess I'll have to wait for the DVD."
2,Is this the best you can do?,Pretty ho-hum photos. I'd hate to see the one's that didn't make the cut. I hope its a fast year so I don't have to look at this weak offerring too long.
2,Not even ok,Confused Axe with Forro... enough said. The fio dental (bikini) should have tipped me off but I'm a little slow.
2,Eh... Not that great.,"We got this with high hopes of the information being presented in unique ways. It wasn't. There were goofy things thrown in the middle. It's basically your boring old algorithms taught by young adults. I can see why the show is no longer on PBS. It doesn't get kids excited about math, it's not interesting. Cyberchase is better, even though it's at a lower level. There are many better products out there. Don't bother with this one."
5,I loved this album and Roy Orbison's music!,"I have to admit that I am not a Roy Orbison fan, but when heard ""A Love So Beautiful"" from the movie ""Indescent Proposal"" I became one. Does anyone know what album this song is on and where I can get it? I'm not sure whether this is the correct title?"
2,Roy Orbison - The Big O,"I received the CD promptly, considering it was shipped from a seller in the UK. I found the CD to look and play fine. My only dissaspointment was that the CD case was badly cracked when it arrived. Besides having a long diagonal crack across the face of the cover, the cases' hinges vere broken off. I looked inside the jiffy bag it was mailed in but the broken off hinges were not there. I can only conclude from this that the case was damaged before it was packaged in the shipping bag.Otherwise the CD is great. I didn't realize it was a double Cd when I bought it."
4,good CD,"I really enjoyed listening to the ""B"" sides again. Some of them it had been so long, I had about forgotten them. I especially wanted to hear ""Mama"" which I think is a very nice sweet song that I haven't been able to find until this CD."
3,Disappointed,"When these came, they were all leaking and didnt have any tape or plastic seals. They only have one plug-like seal inside each bottle which didnt really help much. They sent me out a replacement set and luckily they arrived without leaking. I like the unscented but dont really care for the others."
1,WRONG ITEMS CAME,I ORDERED THESE OILS AND IN THE PACKAGE RECIEVED WAS AN INVOICE FOR THE 3 OILS AND 3# TABLE SHEETS. NO OILS!!!! ANY WHERE!
4,Listen to a sample,"Length:: 0:14 MinsI'm not sure how well the ATR 20 would do for a technophile. We use this microphone for the kids to do karaoke and for me to do my Rosetta Stone. I think the speech recognition isn't as good with this microphone as with the headset that came with my Rosetta Stone, but it's good enough. Most of what I say is recognized by the program.I like that the ATR 20 comes with an adapter so that it can be used with both the karaoke machine and the computer. So far, it's been quite versatile and we've really enjoyed it. I would recommend it for general use."
3,FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE GANGSTERS! OR THE ORIGINAL 'FRIDAY THE 13TH!,"This is an old favorite of mine and it is why I look past some of it's flaws. This is yet another Karloff and Lugosi film but, this one is more of a Sci-fi/gangster picture. Surprisingly Stanley Ridges is the real star of this film and he gives a very convincing performance in a Jekyll and Hyde role. Lugosi has a small shining moment near the end of the picture. Karloff plays a mad doctor again but, he does do it so well. This film is available on DVD and the transfer looks very good. The set is called the Bela Lugosi franchise collection. This set includes four other good horror films."
2,A Disappointing Genre-Bender,"""Black Friday"" (1940) survives as a rarity in cinema history: the gangster-horror film. Unfortunately, the reteaming of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi was jettisoned during preproduction - leaving poor Bela with a minor supporting role and Boris playing second fiddle to Stanley Ridges (who delivers an excellent Jekyll and Hyde characterization originally intended for Karloff). Though ""Black Friday"" moves at a fairly good clip, it remains one of Universal's lesser thrillers."
2,Were People Really This Stupid?,"Professor Kingsley is on his way across the street and gets run over by Red Cannon, a mobster who has other mobsters chasing him. Both are transported in the same ambulance with Prof Kingsley's friend, Dr. Sovac. Kingsley has some kind of concussion and will only live a few more hours, and Cannon is paralyzed. Sovac decides to do a brain transplant between the two (apparenly with no one in the hospital the wiser), and save Kingsley - his physical body anyway. Later Sovac says this was a ""partial"" brain transplant. Needless to say, Red's personality comes out in Kingsley - this is when he slicks his fluffy hair back on his head with his hands, and it automatically sticks and becomes very shiny. The only reason Sovac did the operation was to get Red's $500,000 he had hidden so that he could open up his own lab and do whatever he wants, perhaps more brain transplantations. In the end as they say, there are no winners in this film.Basically, pretty silly."
1,"Oh, please! What a rip off!!","This is the most money I have spent for a piece of junk in a long time! The stupid thing has screws that are so long that when you put it together, the screws come through the seat of the highchair. I bought this for my Daycare class and now I can't use it until I go buy some shorter screws, fix it, sand the seat of the chair, and repaint it. I am so mad!!"
3,"Cute, but not the greatest quality","What a cute high chair. We have the bunk beds as well. However, when putting it together, although the screw holes were pre-drilled, the fiberwood split when screwing the parts together. We have fixed it by filling the split with wood glue and clamping it until it was dry. Also, there was a chunk out of the wood. We have painted it, and it works fine for our dolls. With all of our fixes, it is okay, but truly, the quality isn't the greatest."
1,Not much luck in getting this to work,"I cannot get my Nike Triax c3 SM0013 to register heart rate although others seem able to do so. I wet the waist band and pull it tight but still don't get a number. I am quite sure I have a heart beat, nevertheless."
2,"Monitor is great, service from Famous Brand Watches Awful","This product is great. Seller not so great. I paid for expedited shipping to receive it before Father's Day. Fedex was given the wrong shipping address (I verified I had submitted correctly on several receipts). I had to go to another city and pick up the item at FedEx so he could have it for Father's Day. I contacted Famous Brand Watches in 3 different emails with no response at all. Fedex would not refund the expedited shipping directly to me, only to them and they haven't returned any of my emailed messages. I'm out the expedited shipping charge and the gas that it took to track it down.Great product, but buy it from someone other than this seller."
1,"ONLY BELT, NO BAGS COME WITH IT!!!!","It shows a picture of a belt with lens bags, but they fail to say in the description that those bags in the picture are sold separately!!!!, So I paid $40 for a freaking belt. Stupid."
2,Bad set,This is beautiful china but it has a problem with Crazing. Which are little cracks in the china. This piece hasn't sone yet but most of the rest has. So pick another set.
5,Wonderful DVD,This is a really great DVD - video and audio quality are top-notch and Garland Jeffreys really commands the stage. The band is tight and the songs are fantastic.
3,"CSN---Blah,Blah,Blah.......","OK--I bought this book,because I really do love those guys---but I am sorry to say that the author's sugary treatment of his subjects are probably all that one is ever going to get of CSN. I know that Crosby has written an account. I wish that Graham would write a book--but out of respect for his Bandmates,probably won't---and that's a shame. Because I think he would write an honest account,of how things really went down.But the saddest thing is that Stephen will probably never write an honest,open account---too much pain to re-live,again."
5,Michael shannon! FTW,the movie was great. it all leads to the ending which im not sure what to make of it but excellent none the less.
5,Very different and hard hitting film.,"If you are the type of viewer that needs it all spelled out for you, or seek non stop action move on. This film has great acting, scenery and sound and will stay with you long after you view it."
4,"Requires patience, but worth the time","Strong film, but not quick to say the least. Feels like reading a good book. It is a horror movie if the things that scare you include things like getting cancer or developing Alzheimer's disease. The finish is the only controversial element and worth the effort. Avoid spoilers and reviews if possible. Find 2 hours that you might spend reading and settle in for a psychological challenge. By most accounts this is not an uplifting film."
2,A WASTE OF TWO HOURS - THE MOST BORING MOVIE OF THE YEAR.,"As a real fan of good psychological dramas, horror movies, zombie themes and science fiction movies, I thought I would check out this movie because it was recommended by someone to me. I could not have been more disappointed. This was the most slow moving, most boring and stupid movie I have ever seen this year. I only gave it two stars because I felt generous due to the good acting by the star and co-star. It is easy to understand why this movie did not do good at the box office. It should have been a clue to me why it never received much exposure. If you enjoy watching paint dry you will love this movie.Rating: 2 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Season of the Warrior: A poetic tribute to warriors)"
1,"Depressing, Disturbing and Boring","This movie totally sucked. If you want to watch a movie that is depressing, disturbing and boring this one's for you."
2,Tough to get thru,"Plain and simple, this was just a tough movie to sit through. I was looking for something that never happened."
2,So So,"I had high expectations for this movies but the acting did not live up to the plot. It left me saying ""huh?"" at the end."
1,How on EARTH did this movie get anything above one star?,"I can't for the LIFE of me understand who would rate this movie at 5-stars, 4-stars, or even 3-stars! 120 minutes of my life I cannot get back.This is hands-down the most boring, uneventful waste of time I'd ever seen on film.*sigh*To the reviewers who rated this an ""excellent"" or ""good"" movie, thanks for nothing."
1,take shelter..from this movie,"I admit it--I was suckered by the excellent trailor into wasting two hours of my precious time, but the movie itself was so boring that my family left me to finish watching it after an hour. Unfortunately, I stuck it out until the end. There is nothing--I repeat nothing, worth seeing in this movie. Good acting by everyone, but the movie stinks.Spoiler: For those of you hoping for a huge storm complete with all of the Hollywood special effects--it never comes. It's suggested just before they roll the end credits which leaves room for a Take Shelter II. Can you blame them? They know there's a sucker born every day."
1,Almost a sifi.,"Not so much a sifi as a Hitchcock/Bellview sanatorium flick. Two minutes of special effects, does not makea sifi. And birds forming clouds is natural,tho tornados not so much. A psycosis is. Bird urin on the hand usuelydoesnt cause most people to halusinate. Only the small minded among us could come up with this flakey flick!"
1,Take Shelter from this movie!!! Save your money!,"I could understand had he come out of the shelter and everything was gone, but this was ridiculous! long, drug out waste of time. How did they get 2 hours out of this? Are we able to eliminate stars? When you finally get to the end, (if your able to sit through it) still didn't show enough of what was happening. Very disappointed."
4,moral of the story!?!!!,tHIS MOVIE LEFT ME QUESTIONING A LOT OF THINGS...I believe we R to be left with the moral of the story...simply being....dont let others direct ur life & tell u whats right or wrong! If U have a gut feeling..go with it. If u have these dreams/ visions-believe in them..esp. when they are not only there in your head..strong intuitions but feelings..dont let others tell you do diffrent!! Even if its a woman (ur wife) or a Dr. U know what your thinking/ feeling! Go with ur guts no matter what!!!
2,Paging Rod Serling,"SPOILER ALERT! I found this film riveting, in tone, performances, right up until the ending, which I felt was a betrayal of everything that went before. It's basically a high toned, naturalistic Twilight Zone episode complete with a ""gotcha!"" finale. I would have been happier with a more ambiguous finish."
3,Not Bad,"The concept for this film really sounded entertaining to me and I was very much looking forward to seeing it. I really enjoyed the acting in this film. These not so famous actors put forth a great effort and the film moves steadily because of them. The main characer is done wonderfully and it is a shame this actor wasn't nominated for some kind of award. I also really liked the story and character development. It was solid and kept my interest. The only thing that makes me give this film 3 stars is that I wish there was more to it. I was very involved with what was going on in the film and the ending really left me wanting it to continue. I suppose this is a great thing, since they engaged the viewer so profoundly, but I just wish it could have kept going to see how it all would have panned out for the characters."
3,"Okay suspense, but nothing spectacular","Compared against some of the other duds I've watched lately, this was at least watchable. I would not by any means call it great. It's better than staring at a wall for 2 hours though."
2,World Class FIZZLE,"Simple-minded guy dreams about storms. Preoccupied, he builds a shelter and hides, losing his job and savings and the respect of his family and friends in the process. Is he psychic? Or just an idiot? After sitting through two hours waiting for an answer only to reach end credits, I feel like an idiot. But I just saved you two hours of your life that you can spend more constructively. You're welcome."
2,not good,I did not like this film too mcuh. It was too strange and you can't followthe story.The acting is great only the story line is terrible.
2,Not very good!,This movie is amaturish. It is too long and is boring. Wish I hadn't purchased it. Too many repetitious scenes.
2,Uneventful. Snooze,"Now that I think about it, this movie is alot like Signs. Except less special effects, less plot resolving, and a bit boring. Ouch. But its true. See its about this guy living a simple small town america life, when suddenly he starts have these visions. The visions make him a bit paranoid of his real life, and he starts to wonder if they're just mental delusions, or if they're real. As i said before, it doesn't have a lot of special effects in my opinion. Its really more of a character driven movie; which wouldn't be a bad thing if the dialogue wasn't so boring. I don't want to recommend this movie because I don't want to set your expectations too high."
2,"Starts out strong, weak ending","I really wanted to like this movie, but in the end my wife and I both disliked it. It's well acted and the creepy factor is great. The ""is he crazy or a prophet"" mystery is dragged out way too long. And the ending left me with, ""WTF?!"" It was too silly even for me."
4,ending not great,I liked the movie a lot but I thought the ending was kinda bad I felt there was no closure to it and it made no sense unless they are planning a sequel
4,Powerful performance by Michael Shannon,"Independent movie that is a must have. I'm cheap, however I found no reason to wait until the price came down. Michael Shannon gives a powerful performance. It is an emotional rollercoaster that takes you along for the ride. Jessica Chastain again shows how versital her talents are. You end up feeling for each character in the movie.Blu Ray was my choice. The immages of rural Ohio are dramatically beautiful. The movie extends to two hours long. It is a deliberate pace. Yet, when it is over, it feels like a much shorter movie.Take a chance on this one. Excelent addition to any one's collection."
2,anti climactic,"Preview looked good, ratings looked good. Half way through was wondering why I'm watching it, but was hopeful. The ending left me frustrated an annoyed, they could have done so much more with this movie."
1,cinavia infected - avoid this release,This Sony blu-ray release has an audio track that is infected with cinavia corruption. Send Sony a message that corrupted lossless audio tracks are unacceptable. Do not purchase this.
2,"Ultimately undone, despite some good elements","There is some good acting in Take Shelter, and an interesting and nicely developed story line. It has a nice feel for life in our complex times, and life in a small town.But as many reviewers have noted, it could use about 15 minutes of editing. And especially the last minute, it completely undoes the movie and makes you feel you've just wasted the last two hours of your life."
2,Not worth the 2 hours,Great movie showing what schizophrenia can do to a person/family but had little to nothing else to offer and really not much of a story.
2,Typical artsy fartsy,"Ok, the acting was good, but I am the type of movie watcher who wants to be entertained. If I want to strain my brain, I will pick a good forum and try to stir up a debate. So, if you like the kind of movie which doesn't really go anywhere, but has dark pockets of cerebral imbalance with matching mood music to titillate the artiste in you, well....have fun. At the end, I said....why did I waste my time. Oh, sure the critics loved it, and some audiences, but for my two cents, it was not entertaining, but painful."
1,Total Waste of Valuable time!,"We do NOT recommend this movie. VERY slow moving. You become convinced the guy is nuts. Takes way too long to get to the point of the story and then it's disappointing when it ends. Not much character development of any of the characters. Kathy Baker had a VERY small part, which in itself was a disappointment. She's a great actress who was not given enough screen time to appreciate. Do NOT waste your time on this one."
5,It's Not What You Think!,"This is simply, a very well done movie...with a twist. And it comes as surprise, even to the people who think they have it figured out."
4,Creepy and engaging,"I had been wanting to see this flick for a while since I'd read some reviews. I got drawn in very early and enjoyed the slow build of the plot. The performances are great, too."
3,Not what I expected,I thought this movie was not as good as the description made it out to be. It was too drawn out with little or no action. Very blah!
3,"Some Positives, Some Negatives","Positives:Acting but with that cast it's hard to go wrong.Somewhat well directed and written storyline of a man who appears to have either inherited a delusional, almost paranoid, mental illness or that he has a gift (from whatever source) to foresee an upcoming tragic weather related event.Overall a nice flow of building tension as the viewer is torn between choosing the illness or the supernatural explanation.Negatives:Story had it's plodding predicable stretches especially within a two hour, mostly singular location, movie.Low budget CGI of crows, tidal wave and funnels over ocean was a bit disappointing. Seemed to cheapen the movie.Ambiguous endings in movies are too often a result of writers enamored with their own cleverness. Since it's their story that a viewer has watched for 119 minutes and not the viewer's story they should finish the final minute of their story. Every beginning in life has a ending unless you're into infinite parallel alternative universes."
5,A twist that will stay with you...,You will be carried away on a remarkable journey. Why have I not heard of this movie before? Much respect for leads in this film.
3,Pretty good..but not 5 stars,"I read the reviews on amazon before renting it & several people called it ""excellent, masterpiece "" etc, so I took a chance. The movie was good...but a little slow. However, this type of story has been done before & better. Michael Shannon was in another movie called ""Bug""..same premise as this ""is he crazy or is it real"". See ""Bug"", its a better movie, fast paced & it keeps you guessing."
4,"Review of the movie ""Take Shelter"".","Not exactly what I expected it to be, but Michael Shannon, Jessica Chastain, and Shea Whigham were fabulous. The special effects are pretty good, too."
5,Really good movie!,What a story! You go through the whole movie wondering what is real and what isn't. We thoroughly enjoyed this drama and the ending took us by surprise.
4,enjoyed this a lot,"This is a modern-day Noah type of story with some significant gaps in full character development, but the story stayed with me and made me think. The leads, Michael Shannon and Jessica Chastain, are particularly enjoyable talents. Worth watching and ruminating over the possibilities."
4,A Storm is Coming the Likes You Ain't Never Seen!,"Take Shelter- Michael Shannon is awesome. He's a slow boiler in this movie just like Ben Kingsley was in House of Sand and Fog. He plays a man in the Midwest somewhere (Kentucky-ish, Ohio-like) who begins having visions of an oncoming, terrible storm. He's desperate to protect his family after 4 nights of eerie nightmares and begins repairing a storm shelter. He and his wife have a deaf daughter, but his insurance will cover a cochlear implant that will give her hearing. But as things ratchet up and Shannon questions his own sanity, there's no guarantees of anything at all."
1,I wish I could give this a zero!,"I had high hopes for this movie. It seemed like it had an interesting premise and perhaps some suspense.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It dragged on forever! The payoff was literally 2 seconds at the end. Nothing else in the plot was resolved.The only saving grace in the movie was the acting. The performances were pretty good, they just didn't have a plot (or story) that moved.I was thinking of donating this to the library, but it would be cruel to inflict this on anyone else. I'll probably just throw it away."
2,BORING,Very slow pace. I kept waiting for it to get interesting. Finally when I thought it just might be worth watching - the last scene - it was over. Rather a waste of money.
1,Not what you think,The guy is crazy the whole time. He dreams up these illusions and it leaves you guessing until the end. There's no story to it at all.
2,Too Slow - It was lacking so much,The ending was pathetic. It moves way too slow. Very disappointed. Make a real survival movie. Why did the guy have to be portrayed as nuts? The only thing that made sense was the expense to make plans for a shelter and survive.
4,Allegory?,"There were some similarities between the protagonist and Jesus; although not in a purist sense, I see parallels:1. He is a sort of prophet/visionary2. The scene at church where he loses it and flips over a table -- reminiscent of Jesus in the temple with the moneychangers3. He is rejected and censured for not following local custom/expectations and taking risks4. He does what he feels rightfully compelled to do although others see him as crazy5. His descent into a tomb and arising ""from the dead"" into the lightI definitely see how the storyline at least refers to parallels about a coming apocolypse as referred to in the Bible's book of Revelations."
2,On mental illness,"The protagonist in Take Shelter is a young family man who loses his job and is about to destroy his marriage as he keeps seeing nightmares (and day-mares) about an upcoming apocalyptical storm and other related occurrences. He spends everything they have and don't have to build an underground shelter complete with gas masks, a generator, and amenities. There are many distractions that lead a viewer to believe the storm may actually be coming (some reviewers believe the storm is actually coming). The ambiguous ending contributes to that goal. You may believe that too. To me Take Shelter is a movie about mental illness rather than a supernatual thriller with a proactive hero.I did not enjoy the movie because it was singularly focused and seemed artificial at that. The main actor's skills seemed overshadowed by that of a secondary character, his smart and devoted wife.Not recommended."
3,Interesting story that never develops,"I'm disappointed in this movie. The trailer really draws you in and I thought the story would be really interesting. It was, it was an excellent story & I was completely engulfed in it in the beginning. I actually found myself relating to the psychological dysfunction of the main character. Scary! However, I kept waiting for this ""amazing ending"" that was teased. The ending, sadly, left my fiance and I wanting much much more. I was left with this feeling that the idea in the story never fully developed. My exact thought was ""no this can't be the ending, right?! Nooo!!"". I wanted to see something else happen that never did. That's all. This movie could've been phenomenal!"
2,Following,"This moving was very slow, you had to watch very closely or you would miss the story line. No surprises for me. Granted, I did not know about the movie, if I had, I would not have rented it. The description of the movie before renting was not efficient to describe the movie."
1,You can find much better books available.,"I purchased this Culture Shock book when I moved to China for a year to teach English. It was my first exposure to the Culture Shock series. I found this book to have a very discouraging view of China and the book gave me all sorts of false impressions of what to expect. Granted, I found the book was geared more towards the business traveler than others, but I found most of the advice to be useless or out of date. In fact, I found most of the impressions which the book created to be false after only a short time in China. If you are planning on going to China, I would recommend that you purchase a book such as the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide series instead. These books give a better feel for the history and culture than the Culture Shock book."
3,Changing Times,"The idea of this book is excellent; however, because it's 5 years old it is not as up-to-date as it could be. China is changing rapidly and some of the customs and other information presented is already out-dated. It should be up-dated more freaquently."
1,Yikes!,"I bought this book to help prepare for our move to China in June. I have read and enjoyed other Culture Shock books before (Culture Shock Malaysia is wonderful and very helpful) but I was blown away by this book's awfulness. It should have been called, ""Out-dated Personal Ramblings of a Typo-prone Journalist in China."" Sarcasm is rampant, the author refers to the reader as ""pal"" and frequently admonishes him (as in, ""too bad, pal. China isn't going to change for you."") and the vast majority of the so-called advice is terribly outdated.The Culture Shock people should take this book off the market before it seriously damages their name."
5,"I disagree,,,","Well, I was only in China for 18 days, but I found this book unusually informative, really interesting to read, and very helpful on a number of occasions where I would have totally misunderstood a given situation."
3,A unique look at China.,"It's not bad - just a little different from many other ""travel"" books. It's a bit outdated, though."
5,NFL Films-The Dallas Cowboys-The Complete History,I bought this item as a gift for a Cowboy fan and they loved it. Great gift for Cowboy fans.
3,Lovely book,"This can be a good book for children who play rugby and also for them who want to play rugby. But I want to say that the people who love rugby can enjoy reading this book. This is a simple book, but one can feel the atmosphere in the rugby field."
3,Okay for bulky gear.,"The straps are good for heavy or bulky camera gear. They are way too massive for the smaller digital cameras, i.e. Olympus Camedia and Canon IS2."
3,Today and Tomorrow a classic?,"Being a major Elvis fan, I was busting at the seams waiting for this baby, unfortunately when it arrived, I was slightly disappointed. A couple of the recordings are very hissy, Steadfast, Loyal and True being a bad one. I know they are old, but that particular track is a studio take! Memories has a very abrupt ending, and I am sure Roustabout has been previously released on Collectors Gold back in the early 90's. The title track however,is worth the price alone, and its nice to hear alternate versions of some of the later 60's movies-Wonderful World is a belter.Don't get me wrong, this is a fine box set but if this was a report card, it would say: ""Could Do Better""."
5,Elvis Presley Rocks period!,"This is a great set.Gives a fantastic overview of Elvis,start to finish.I love that they are almost all previously unreleased versions .Rock,soul,blues,country,gospel.Elvis did it all.It's Elvis and thats enough!"
1,"Today, Tomorrow, Forever - A Really Bad Product",Save your ears and your money. This is such a very bad recording that Elvis is often unrecognizeable. The producers have scraped the bottom of the barrel to come up with recordings of Elvis not fit for human consumption ... then or now.
5,The greatest from the greatest,"This one has it all some of the best songs from the greatest entertainer the world will ever know.And for those fans of his music from the 70's like myself then thisis a must.Disk #4 alone is worth the [money]that it cost the songs that reallystand out are track #4 ""the next step is love"" track#5""life""track#9 ""fools rush in"" track #12 ""where do I go from here""track#15 ""I miss you"" track#17 if you talk in your sleep"" andby far one of the best songs elvis ever recorded track#20""pieces of my life.Take it from a true []elvis fan this set is a must have forthe real elvis fans."
3,Don't waste your money!,The movie itself is a classic and a must see if you haven't already but if you wish to purchase this DVD go elsewhere. The DVD jacket was wrong so I thought I got the wrong movie and after purchasing it for almost $20 bucks I was traveling not too long after and saw it for $9.99 and felt cheated for overpaying.
4,FYI,"Anyone buying this CD should know that it is a repackage of a previous Cathedrals CD: Goin' In Style (1988) with 3 of the five members pictured on the cover (the 3 youngest) not even being in the group at the time. It still is a good CD with a good combination of members, but I wanted to clear up any misunderstanding the cover or new name might cause. As I recall, there are more songs with a ""country"" style than most of their other work. Highlights are: I'm Feelin' Fine (upbeat), Sin Will Take You Farther (laid back country), I Can See The Hand (mid tempo, with good Tenor and Bass vocals), Back To Bethel (another upbeat one), and Remind Me Of Calvary ( a pretty ballad)."
4,Gotta have,"If you love the Cathedrals, this one you must get! There style and class shows and these songs will touch your heart."
2,Nothing Special,"You've definitely heard this before, but performed by other bands. The singing just RUINS the disc. And the music sounds overproduced and appealing to a mainstream crowd. If you're looking for something groundbreaking, look somewhere else. Let this disc gather dust in the secondhand bin and check into quality metalcore like Between The Buried and Me, All That Remains, Dead To Fall, Into The Moat, The Red Chord, and Converge."
2,Why does this have such a high rating?!,"I stumbled upon this album a while ago, sitting in my collection and gathering dust. I had to laugh a little; it's probably the worst album in my collection and I was so dumb for buying it. I managed to get it a long time ago for $5, and even at that price, I wouldn't buy it again. It's that bad.They kind of remind me of a cheap version of All That Remains, which begs the question: if you want to hear this kind of music, why not just buy an ATR disc? It's extremely generic metalcore, and any metal fan would say that they've heard this a thousand times before. The album is also amazingly boring and monotonous. To this day, I can only vaguely recall one song (""The Cycle"") and that one song is probably the best on here.Disregard all the comments about how ""great they are live"", because in a studio setting, this is just a rehashing of better bands. Nothing more."
5,I'm Shocked,I was walking around in Walmart when this album caught my eye and I recognized the name from when they went on tour with GWAR (one of my favorite bands) so I figured why not? Lets givem a try. When I got home I quickly popped it in my cd player and was just shocked. Every song on this CD is very good (and listenable if your not a death-metal fan) So I would definately recommend givin this one a try.
4,A Dozen Furies Lives up to their title,"I would have been lying if I had said I didn't have my preconceptions about this band. Once I heard the first song, their concept from fire burned all of mine. This is a very good cd on it's own recogniscence. It does kind of sound like everything else that is out there right now(Killswitch,Shadows Fall,Avenged Sevenfold(when they were good) but, these guys are pretty good musicians and they really do bring it. The title track and ""The Cycle"" are my favorite songs. The guitar riffing is spectacular and the drummer is insane and very Vinnie Paul influenced. Pretty good cd. If you don't have it then go and get it."
2,"Cartoonish, yet disturbing novel on divorce","Warren Adler's book ""War of the Roses"" is actually not well written, but does manage to be disturbing enough. But the cartoonish and irrational escallions of the divorced couple was definately not believable. You feel very badly for the children and for Anne, as both Mr. and Mrs. Rose steam full ahead on a path of destruction which will doom them both. Only merits 2 stars"
4,Good book - better movie,"This is one of the extremely RARE times when the movie was better than the book. In the movie, things escalate logically, with a little humor to keep it from getting too dark. Even at the end, when both spouses have ""lost it,"" there was an enraged logic to their actions. In the book, things got TOO over-the-top. Filling a bathtub with rancid food, turning the whole house into a booby-trap, it was just not believable.At times, it digressed into a ""women's lib"" commentary on how a woman exists just to validate a man. A key plot point is that Jonathon doesn't understand why his wife wants a divorce. In the movie, we can side with Barbara at times, just as we side with Jonathon at other times. In the book, she just comes across as needing some cheese with that whine.Get the movie, skip the book."
5,Great resource!,"Just received this and I am already impressed with it as a resource! I didn't find much use for the hiring section, but in general it was a good read to help me understand how to better use my time and have a more effective ministry! DEFINITELY make sure the book you buy has the CD-ROM!"
5,Great book!,This is an awesome book that I would recommend to any worker in student ministry. It has helped me manage my ministry smarter and more as a pastor. I highly recommend this book!
5,excellent resource,"Though this text is a little pricey, it's worth the investment. It is full of very practical, easy to follow ideas and info on keeping your youth ministry organized (e.g how to find/train/evaluate volunteers, organizing an event, organizing your workspace, finding a youth ministry position, etc). This is not one of those skimpy youth ministry books you can read in an hour--it is text-rich with helpful information, tips, and ideas.I have been doing youth ministry for over 13 years and I have found much useful info within the book and have made good use of the accompanying cd rom that contains all the forms printed in book plus a great program for organizing background info on all of your youth and adult leaders."
4,Good basics.,This was a replacement issue. It did not have the CD but while the blurb said it did not I missed that. The seller was easy to work with. The book is very good for the basic administrative ideas.
5,Best Non-nude Mag Out There,"I've been ""reading"" this magazine since it's debut & it has more eye candy per square issue than any other mag out there. It showcases busty girls of all sorts of ethnicities who are primarily fitness contestants or models but it also occasionally features an adult actress as well. There is no full nudity (ie: Playboy) but the girls still look sexy as hell & don't leave much to the imagination in their bikinis & skimpy tight outfits. So as long as you're ok with that, you're gonna have a good time.Another thing that's great about this mag is that it's not loaded with ad's & it also contains dating tips for men & various statistics about sex & relationships which are almost always interesting & funny to read.My only complaint is that AC recently went from 6 issues & an occasional special issue (summer/holiday) to only 4 per year.But, for my money, it's still the best non-nude mag out there for men."
4,Good product - Doesn't do good on carpets,"our baby enjoys it, but it gets stuck on carpets which is a bummer..."
1,WARNING: one model deemed unsafe by CR,"Serious Warning: Consumer Reports, the independent consumer magazine, called a specific model of this walker, model 14565, ""unacceptable"" because it's unsafe. (See their Dec. 8, 2006 blog on their website.) Anohter similar model, 14570, is okay. Model 14565 is deemed unsafe by CR because it does not prevent the walker, and the baby, from falling downstairs as it should. CR points out that the 14565 is still in the retail channel. Unfortunately, it's impossible to tell which model Amazon is selling. Your best bet is another brand or check one out in a retail store. Be sure to avoid model 14565!"
4,Good Dog Book - bit wordy,"Excellent book for people who love dogs, at times the writing is a bit wordy and overly detailed, but still information and experiencing the emotional side of owning dogs can be gleamed from it as seen and felt from the author's point of view."
5,works well for a reasonable price,we were pleased with our purchase. the material is heavy enough that it doesn't rip easily and won't blow away with the wind. we would buy it again.
2,Only so-so bike cover,"This bicycle cover is average at best. It is basically made out of the same material as a picnic table cloth - vinyl on the outside and that fuzzy white stuff on the inside. This inside lining catches on everything and sheds. I have not used the cover long enough yet to know how it will last in cold and sun. It is large and would likely fit most bicicles, but there is no way to keep it in place. It is basically just a large wind catcher that you drop down over the bicycle. Wind will lift it right off. There is one miniscule little square of velcro that I suppose is supposed to stick to the fuzzy white lining on the opposite side. This one tiny square of velcro would not hold up to even the slightest breeze or movement so it is useless. A drawstring along the bottom edge or some kind of straps would be much more useful."
1,cracks and rips in freezing temperatures,"I liked the size and fit. But it didn't make it through a New England winter. The material looses its pliability and gets brittle in the cold, and then rips at the slightest touch. I had the same problem with patio furniture covers, same material, from Brookstone. Maybe fine in a heated garage - but then who needs a bicycle cover in a heated garage? Maybe ok outside in Florida or on the West Coast?"
4,Protects,Main reason for purchase was to protect my bike from the outside elements which it does. Met my expectations & would purchase again. Good quality material.
5,weatherizer,"These covers are exactly as advertised, and I'm very satisfied with them. We have 2 bikes that must stay out side, and these covers completely protect them from the elements. Bikes are expensive, and keeping them sheltered is important."
3,This is why there are varying reveiws maybe?,"I was reading some of the reviews and while most of them seem good there are quite a few that aren't. If you check product features as I did (I listed it below anyway.) It seems there are three different versions of this at least. Check the first bullet point. It either has elastic coating, straps, or both. I will stay away from this product as I don't like to play the lottery with things I spend my money on.Product FeaturesColor: Charcoal* Elastic edging and/or straps keep our mountain bicycle cover in place.* Shell is lined with soft felt-like fabric to safeguard from scratches.* Protects against bitter cold down to -22F without cracking.* Shell shields your bike from all kinds of weather.* Dimensions: 70 3/4"" W x 42"" L x 42 7/8"" H."
2,not really a bike cover,"This thing is shaped like a bbq cover or something. Both ends appear to be designed for handlebars. At least it's heavy and seems waterproof. The bad part of this purchase was Brookstone. Awful service. They need to train employees to work with Amazon, if they're going to pass themselves off as an Amazon merchant."
2,not good for Arizona heat,Had it for two years. Worked fine 1st year. But Arizona sun is strong. Plastic is cracking and brittle now.h
1,"Heavy/bulky, strict 30 day return policy","This is a long term ""I'm going to leave my bike out over the winter"" type cover. It may not blow off as other product reviews state but it's very heavy & bulky; it's not a cover that you can take with you and use on a portable basis. NOTE: Brookstone has a very strict 30 day from date of order return policy. Look for my ""new"" cover on Amazon.com"
4,Good Product,Product came as advertised and was large and substantial. Only concern is that it seemed unusually long for Brookstone to process the order. It's like them have a set time (1 week- 10 days) for the delivery and they hold back the item so it ships according to that schedule. If it was in stock (and it didn't indicate otherwise) then it should have shipped within a day or two.
3,Color is not beige,"It is functional and gets the job done. However, I got a grey one, not beige like the picture."
2,Did not make it through the winter,I've used this cover for about a year now. My bike sits outside on my front porch and is pretty exposed so I wanted a cover that could really protect it. We had a pretty snowy winter and this cover did NOT last. Right now it has so many rips and cracks that it is almost useless. Like one of the other reviewers I also found that it blew off a couple times in stronger winds. I'm sure it's fine for general storage inside a garage or other protected area.
2,Not the best,"I was very anxious to see this, as it was the first solo performance for Misha since he arrived in the U.S. Unfortunately, the pieces chosen did not really illustrate his great dancing abilities AND they were all done with no backdrop whatsoever, so it was more like the local ballet school's graduation recital. I have some wonderful videos and DVDs of Baryshnikov, but this is not one of them."
2,not very entertaining,"I ordered this with the knowledge of dissappointment but wanted anyway. i got to watch Gelsey but was pitying more than admiring. Her body was extremely thin, couldn't get past that & her illfitting costumes. Hated everything but her. Since there is not much out there for Gelsey fans that is why I purchased."
4,"A classic, naturally","Not Gelsey Kirkland's best work, but Baryshnikov is a joy. This tape would be a must-have if only for Vestris, the only original ballet he brought with him to the west, but with Spectre de la Rose (w/ M. Tcherkasky) and the other pas de deux (DQ, Coppelia) it's truly a treasure."
2,Its not that great. I would buy for anyone else,I didnt prefer this as the vocals seem mediocre and songs seem slightly sped up. One of my songs I swear has been cut short so I wouldnt say its the worst but I definitely have more kinds that are better.
1,Waste of money,Don't waste your money on this product. I have ran the screen wash program 3 different times and I do not see any reduction in the burnt in image. When I calibrated the TV (LCD screen) it seems too dark and I have to increase the brightness above the recommendated levels. Sure glad I could return to factory settings after using the program.
1,customer service not available,Did not see any difference and could not get any help from customer NO service.
1,Worthless,I bought this DVD to remove a channel logo that had burned into my plasma TV. The disc was a complete waste of time and money and made no difference whatsoever!
1,a waste of money,"This DVD comes with no printed instruction manual, and no on-screen help. The disc contains a PDF file of very limited instructions, which I found vague and basically useless. The DVD itself is nothing more than a series of calibration images, most of which aren't even mentioned, much less explained, in the instruction file. My advice: save your money."
1,Completely useless.,"This DVD didn't do anythng to improve the resolution on my HP plasma TV.It didn't fix/repair the one dead pixel I have, and it didn't fix/repair the vertical rows of pink pixels I've had on my screen for the past few months.I ran the DVD patterns as advised for many hours over multiple days.Nothing.No difference or improvement at all.This DVD was a complete waste of money.I would strongly advise anyone out there to save their money and to not purchase this product."
5,Wash your picture woes away!,"Did not buy this DVD to use the calibration features, but for the Pixel Washer Features. Have LED LCD TVs in the house and at least once a month run each of the Pixel Washes for several hours. Brightens up the picture quality and sharpens the video as well, in the before and after reviewing. Have recommended this to many people. Only one person has ever gotten back to me, and he stated that he couldn't believe how the washes revived his old Sony CRT that he'd just about given up on, plus his new LED LCD as well. Several people have scoffed at me using it on LCD screens, but just told them to try it and see for themselves! I definitely don't want to be without it."
2,Pixel Protector,Product did not work on removal of my plasma burn in. I have used it several times with no apparent improvement.
2,Did not work for us,"We have used this a total of three different times, going through all three washes each time and it did not get rid of the stuck (red) pixel on our 4year old Sony 50 inch rear-projection tv. We were very optimistic but sorry to say it didn't work at all on the pixel, however it did make the color much better, so it wasn't a total waste of money."
4,"got rid of my ""stuck Pixel""","I bought this because I had a ""stuck pixel"" on my somewhat older Pioneer Plasma monitor model 5030 HD. This monitor was over 7 grand, so I must say I FREAKED OUT when there was a tiny red blinking star on the screen! My eye went right to it EVERY time. At first I thought this DVD was a ripoff (3 screen washers and various ""calibrators""). I think patience is the key with this product....I first used a software called JScreen Fix (as the 50"" display is my pc monitor too!) This did not work on its own. After running the various WASHERS on Pixel Protector, much of the plasma ghosting was gone. After a few times, the stuck pixel was gone too. Don't try to use this for a 1/2 hour and say it didn't work. Patience is the key. Let it run for the 6 to 7 hours, then try the other washers (2 & 3). I did see an improventment and the red dot is thankfully gone! Would it have gone away on its own? Not sure. But it is gone now!"
1,This Pixel Protector DVD did absolutely nothing,"When I first read Amazon's top review, it gave me hope that this product would actually help my plasma problem. I have the same Pioneer unit with exactly the same flashing red pixel and thought I would have described the problem with my plasma in identical fashion. That being said, I spent over thirty hours attempting to achieve any improvement in either the flashing red pixel and/or picture quality. In the end, I was unable to achieve any improvement whatsoever.I sent an e-mail to the companies website and described my problem and asked for help and I did not receive any response.Fortunately, Amazon has a return policy so I returned this useless DVD.Any review reporting any positive improvement in picture from use of this ""Pixel Protector"" is more likely the result of a psychosomatic and hopeful perception rather than any objectively verifiable visual improvement.I could NOT recommend this product to others."
2,Pixel Protector,It has not helped with the image retention problem with my LCD TV despite running it many times for several hours.
1,defective product,The two DVD's from this manufacturer were defective and wouldn't play in my DVD player. I had to go through the whole process of shipping them back and asking for a refund. I'll not buy DVD's from Amazon again until I hear an apology from this manufacturer about their shoddy quality control.
1,Ambient Water:Ultimate disappointment,"I bought this along with another virtual aquarium hoping to show off my 37in hd flatpanel. The only responses I got from showing it off was ""Did you pay money for that?""It looks like someone mounted a camcorder next to a couple aquariums at the local pet store and tried to cash in. There is nothing HD about this dvd, in fact I've seen independent features with better video quality than this."
2,"Not HD, its misleading","Notice how it only says ""shot in hd""? Anything put on film is shot in HD. I expected much more. The tank scenes are nowhere near HD. If the novelty means enough to you, buy it. I planned on using it for parties, but have not because of the poor quality."
1,EXTREMELY DECIEVING!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD if you plan on recieving a beautiful HD image, because as amazing as you think it will appear, it simply won't look as incredible as it could...because it is still a regular DVD. DVD's can only go up to 480p resolution which is NOT HD. it could have been shot on HD, it could have been shot on beautiful 35mm even(better than HD digital) and it still will look the same as a regular dvd because DVD's cannot and will not ever be able to produce resultions of up to 720p 1080i-p (these are HD resolutions). So for them to put ""Shot in HD"" all over the cover, and to make people think that they're going to recieve beatiful images is just crap. You want a real fish tank image, go buy a real one, or get the HD-DVD aquarium dvd, that actually shows 720p-1080i image quality with appearently better footage anyway. Just make sure you got a HD-DVD player before you do!"
3,Under water,"If you like to watch fish, this is for you. Almost as boring as an aquariam. But also as lifelike."
2,Disappointed,"Not at all what I expected. Quality was so-so. Aquariums were dull. Gold fish?? Oh puh-leeze!My toddle liked it for a bit, so I guess the price was right!"
3,Next best thing....,"I work in a 9-1-1 center and bought the video for the call-takers/dispatchers to enjoy. Since we are surrounded by computers we of course can't have a real aquarium near the consoles. I thought this was the next best thing. Everyone seems to enjoy it. The sound quality varies with each selection. On some you will have to keep the volume very high on the TV to hear the ""bubbles."" Since we keep the TV on mute that is not a major concern for us. The tanks that are the most popular are the ones that have the most active fish.We like the ""loop"" function that allows the same ""tank"" to play over and over.The ""play all"" feature is nice also."
4,Great Quality and variety of aquariums,"This DVD is very high quality and lifelike. The variety - fresh and salt water make it nice for a change. Looks great on our 42"" HDTV in the living room"
1,Falsely Advertised,"ATTENTION: ""Shot in HD"" apparently translates to ""Horrible Video Quality"". After buying what I expected to be an HD dvd I played it in my brand new SONY 1080i HD TV. The quality on most of the aquariums is horrendous. The picture is grainy, and it seems that either the fish or the background is always out of focus. The dvd seems to be set up to advertise their other products and the main menu looks like it was designed in a preschool drawing class. The sound effects were likely made by people blowing bubbles in their milk. I would strongly reccomend that anyone considering this DVD take their money elsewhere."
5,Ambient Water: Ultimate Video Aquarium,I purchased this as a relaxation video as I was going to be laid up for a few months due to surgery. I love fish but don't have the room for an aquarium. This video is absolutely awe inspiring! The scenes are as if you are right there in the midst of it. I play it constantly as it truly is very enjoyable to sit and watch. It is like having your own without all the fuss!
5,This book brings many counter-intuitive points.,"I found chapters on sleeping and drugs use especially fascinating as they do effectively challenge popular and even professional traditional opinion. To make my point I want to present you a pop quiz based on the book's contents (please keep in mind that the book is counter-intuitive):1) A person who sleeps four hours a day or less will usually suffer health consequences. True or False?2) Smoking and Alcohol use are detrimental to one's health, but they are not as dangerous and addictive as illegal drugs. True or False ?3) A very low caloric short-term diet could permanently help one lose weight. True or False ?The answer to above questions is False, to find why you need to read this avant-garde textbook."
5,Complements Galore,Every where you go people ask what you have on . Women want to buy it & men say they want to get some for their wives .
2,Cologne seemed to have gone bad,I love Confess cologne and have ordered it before. This shipment disappointed me as it seemed to be too sweet (like it had gone bad).
2,Not for me,"I bought this based on reviews (it's available at Target and Walgreens - so not that hard to find). I can't say I like it. I didn't like the original Obsession much either, but the reviews stated that this smelled better than the original.It was ok for a few hours, however, the floral scent tends to dissipate first, leaving the spicier, earthier scents that linger on clothing. And that's the problem. When all is said and done, at the end of the day, my clothes and me smell like ""eau de old man"". Very much like someone I would not sit near on public transport. And I'm a regular bather too, so it has nothing to do with my hygiene.Perhaps my personal chemistry and this don't mix. I don't know.I would assume that the actual, more expensive Calvin Klein Obsession won't react the same, but I haven't tried it.I think I'll stick to the more floral /citrus / vanilla scents (i.e. Hugo Boss Orange) from now on."
5,Just Say'in:,I have been using this for years and still can not find a product that even comes close. My only issue it that I can't find it in the stores here in MN. Body spray but no perfume.
3,Nice perfume,I bought this perfume because I have worn it in the past and am familer with it and like it's scent. The item came in a timely manner and in great packaging. Don't know what else to say about it.
5,"Love, Love, Love this scent !",I love this scent !! I smelled it on someone else a few years back and have worn nothing since....even gave up on Chanel #5 in its place...I live in souther rural AZ and have a hard time finding it...even wrote the company and they assured me they are NOT stopping...so it's online for me !
2,Eh.,"I'm not impressed. I think everyone falls victim to the ""monster cables are greater than everything"" bs at least one time in their life.I purchased a no name splitter for about $1.00 and had better performance."
1,Junk,Provided NO better picture or reception than the typical 3 dollar splitter...and to top it off....the monster splitter failed after 3 months. It is a Taiwan product...and the monster cable brand does not offer any assurance of quality.
4,LS 420 Review,"Bought it for my wife as a birthday gift. She loves it. It is easy to use and small / light weight. It does not come with all the whistles and bells some cameras do. It's a point and shoot for casual situations. If you dont want all the tech gizmos and just want to take good quality snaps shot with an easy to use camera this is for you. If you are a tech geek and like to tweak with things this is not your camera. It's perfect for my wife who wants to it to fit in her purse and be easy to use but take good shots. Easy to upload to computer with the INCLUDED docking station with one button upload. Get a memory card as the internal just isnt enough if you take pics like my wife. Optical zoom would be nice, but i guess you cant get it all in something this small and easy to use. Video is cool too with this tiny camera."
3,wet kiss,"I thought that this dvd was very well done for their first movie.They did not have much of a buget for this movie. A word to all of the actors from Bryon(ask lee) very good job and thanks for the signatures. Looking forward to what you guys have instore for us next.Thanks, Bryon"
1,its junk,"junkie, like the other guy said, the led is super bright. i wanted to keep it on my nightstand, but it easily was bright enough to make shadow puppets on my ceiling. i busted out the lcd the next day with a screwdriver. then a few days later the charging part got all finicky and would only charge if i tilted my phone a certain direction. it finally quit working all together after about 10 days. junk."
3,Missing book,There was no discovery guide with the DVD as shown in the add. It is hard to do the study without the guide.
5,Walking with God in the Desert,This was a gift. I enjoyed my own copy and decided it would be great to share this with family..
1,Software CD,The CD was cracked and has not been replaced. I have been waiting over 1 month for the replacement.
4,great jack stand SET!!!,"What a surprise when I received these stands. I couldn't find information or a picture of these anywhere.I ordered them out of curiosity, expecting one jack stand for the price. These are 6 ton (each), steel stamped, not cast.Very happy with set, would have given 5 stars if they were not made in China.Joe Gibbs is a Nascar legend and was hoping they were made here, but not surprised. Ordering another set tomorrow."
4,A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains,"The book was an interesting account of Bird's travels through the Rocky Mountains, but as I read it, I kept wondering why, why, why? Why would a 41-year old woman travel through the Rockies on horseback in winter? Living in the area where she traveled, I appreciate the descriptions of the mountains and the awesomeness of nature which she elegantly describes. The book is an interesting travel log of her journey and adventures in 1873."
2,Not recommended if you are AMT eligible,"If you are at risk for the alternative minimum tax, DO NOT BUY THIS TAX PACKAGE.When you get to the AMT section, there's no more friendly ""interview"". TC Premium abruptly tells us to fill out the form!! There are 48 line items on that single IRS form. No friendly interview, no carry-over, just fill out the form.It's even worse with the AMT credit on the MN return. TC didn't even include the form! It simply provided the URL for the IRS web site.I was also disappointed in the handling of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). Basically the software provides a text box describing how to do the calculations, then sends you over to the regular capital gains area.This simply isn't sufficient. Not recommended."
1,"""picture book"" with occasional words thrown in.","After visiting Mr. Trampe's website, I decided to look for his book. The images appeared to be outstanding quality; instead they look like 4x6 machine prints that were then blown up to 8x10 by the publisher..... horribly pixelated and some aren't even focussed! Of course, there are some that are very nice, but I expected (Wrongly it seems) that the entire book would have been high-quality printing. I would reccommend glancing thru it.... but that is all. As for descriptions of technique, there are 2 of any detail. And very abstract.... ""I took several shots""."
3,laurel & hardy-14 episode dvd-brentwood,"not a great collection of films, most are silent,most are not laurel and hardy together, but for the price, it is an interesting collection of shorts, home movies,their last feature film ""Utopia"", and a quick interview with mr.hardy. there's also a color documentary about plastic from 1943. the quality of the films vary but most are decent. worth owning to any l & h fan."
2,Not what I expected,"A lot of silent comedies, many in very rough condition. As a team, Laurel and Hardy are seldom seen. None of their excellent two-reelers."
3,"""Simple Folks"" Beware","This is the third year I have used Taxcut, and up until this year I have been quite satisfied. It is indeed ""simple"", but if you happen to have an unusual situation, it may be too simple.If you aren't pretty knowledgeable about tax preparation, you could still miss some deductions/exclusions. I had to search forever to find a Form 5329 to exclude a retirement refund from a 10% early withdrawal penalty. If I hadn't known by other sources that I needed it, Taxcut would never have told me to use it, or where to find it for that matter. I guess it is good for the price, but if you have anything you know is unusual, do your homework and make sure you find what you need. Cheers!"
1,Don't download from Amazon!!,Horrible download support and service from Amazon. Good luck trying to download this software from Amazon- myself and 2 office co-workers could not download the software.Your best bet is to goto the store and buy the CD.
5,Another perfectly written Zander/Nielsen ballad!,"Brilliant in it's simplicity, the boy's introspective take as they search the embers of another heartbreak. Highly recommended, though most of you will feel a tinge of sad reflection as we have all been there before."
3,Enjoyable but not a keeper,"I like Merline Lovelace (what a great name for a romance writer!!) Her knowledge of the Airforce is great and she gives you tiny details which make that world seem real and alive.Mike Page was a delicious hero, with an iron jaw, a perfect body and he could cook. I liked him a lot and could relate to his perfectionism and his pain. However the heroine, Jen Varga seemed less well drawn. I found her a bit irritating if truth be told (and as this is a review, where better to tell the truth!) She seemed to get into serious situations without giving it due thought - her marriage, her career, her current trials in the book, were all approached in a slap dash manner and she seemed younger than her years. While Mike had suffered and grown, she seemed to be stuck in a petty rebellious mode.Having said all that it was an interesting read, and I was happy to have it, but I won't keep it.Hope this helps you,amf"
3,More of a 3 and 1/2 stars rating,"This was my first Merline Lovelace novel. It was a quick read, but did not compare to the military writings of Suzanne Brockmann. Maybe that's because the air force men were not as hot and interesting as SEALs are.This book was not bad, but it did have a few flaws. It starts out rather slow and uninteresting in the beginning. The suspense does pick up a little, but it is the character's attraction that keeps the story moving along. The ending seemed too rushed and did not rap up as well as it could have. The villains were never a mystery, there were no twists and turns and no surprise ending. You pretty much know everything within the first few chapters, including everyone involved. Even though I breezed through reading it in about eight hours, I just didn't find it that suspenseful. Save yourself some money and check this one out from the library."
3,Not the best military romantic suspense,"I read this book at the suggestion of a review on Amazon. There were moments where the book made me smile or laugh, but I thought the characters were terribly mismatched. Other than sexual, I don't see their attraction to each other at all. Why would a career military Lt.Col. have any interest in a Captain that just whined and complained all the time? She spent most of her resources trying to get out of the military, not make the best of it. Mike followed the rules and enjoyed his military career and Jennifer did as little as she could to get by. She totally stumbled into the danger by accident.I can't see these two characters lasting longer than a year. What happens when Jennifer gets bored with Mike?This is the first Merline Lovelace I've read. I think I'll give one more a try, but if you really want great military romance/suspense you've gotta read Suzanne Brockmann, she's the best!"
2,"Cheap, Plastic-y, and breaks within minutes of use","I bought this truck as a birthday gift for my four year old son, who loves tow trucks. I didn't expect it to be great, but for the price I didn't expect the pieces to be barely hanging on and made of brittle plastic that snapped LITERALLY while I was taking it out of the box. He was SO excited when he saw it, and heartbroken as every single piece, down to the tires, started falling off over the course of two days. I've had it for about 48 hours now and ive had to repair the tires, put pieces back on, etc....and he's just been rolling it around! It's not for play...It's a piece of junk."
2,Not worth the money!,"The book includes 55 rail-trails, but only 21 are longer than 10 miles--a large number are 0.5-2.0 miles! The Rails-to-Trails Conservancy and the publisher must be trying to ""stretch"" the books into multiple volumes (""Southeast"", ""Northwest"", ""New England"")to have 50 trails in each, even if many are only 1 mile long! If you live in region ""X"", and want to travel to region ""Y"" to ride, you're not interested in trails of only 0.5 to 5.0 miles!On the positive, trail descriptions are detailed; great maps; contact for the organization responsible for the trail; directions to access points are clear."
4,a good research book,I'm planning an extended bicycle trip through Florida and this book helps get it all organized...Rails and Trails is the way to make sure you travel as safely as possible....
3,NOT INFORMATIVE,NOT AS INFORMATIVE AS I HAD HOPED.IT IS JUST O.K.I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.ALSO IF I HAD SEEN ONE FIRST I WOULDN'T HAVE ORDERED IT!!..........
3,"Great concept, some problems","This product is great in concept and often useful in execution, but it's slow. Slow to load and often strangely and inexplicably slow to produce an active cursor on a note on the desktop. I've waited as long as 45 seconds after clicking on a note before I'm able to edit it. Search is slow, and sometimes certain features become unavailable, although I've found that if you restart the computer, things work much better. If you're going to use Sticky Brain, you'll want to be restarting your computer on a regular basis."
1,Catastrophic support,"I believe this product has been replaced by SOHO Notes.This company has the worst technical support and policies I have have ever run into, period. There is no telephone support, no email support, only a form where they promise 1 to 5 day response (right...). Their program stopped working in Snow Leopard, for which their response was to offer a $25 upgrade.Which crashes my computer.So all of my data stored in their database is no lost, because no version of their program that I have will run. And they have yet to return any forms I sent them. For what it is worth, the phone number I located thru directory assistance is never answered.As for the program itself, I found it useful but incredibly slow for my tiny database.But,the primary consideration for any database is that it not lose your data.Which theirs just did."
3,Not Compatible with Tiger or Leopard!,"While the product itself appears promising, if you have the most recent version(s) of MAC, you have to purchase a $25 upgrade to SOHO notes. Since SOHO on its own isn't that expensive, you might as well start with it."
4,Nice solid wood/metal frame,"Solid wood and high quality hardware, not difficult to assemble but does take some time. A little flex in the frame has you rolling to the outsides from time to time, but I'm a pretty big guy. Can't imagine there's a better frame for this price out there. Also, shipped blazing fast."
3,Assembly was a challenge.,"Once assembled, I love this unit, even though the bed is a little smaller than anticipated. However, assembly was a major pain as two of the pilot holes we seriously misaligned, which made it very difficult to line up the assembly hardware properly. I am handy, so I figured out a work around, but if this is standard issue, it might be difficult for those who are not handy.I would not be writing this review were it not for a problem which just developed. One of the welds on the seat frame snapped. I have written the manufacturer for a replacement. I'll update this review when I have a response.The final product is attractive and sturdy (weld aside). Were it not for what appear to be quality control issues, I'd be giving this 5 stars. But the QC issues have been a hassle."
4,Works Well,Not bad. Works well for a visor. Has lots of extra space for other things. This product is very durable!
2,doesn't measure up to Suunto,"I've put this watch, and the Suunto vector, through their paces in expedition kayaking. The Suunto's electronics are much better. Here's some more comments:1. The Nike watch is much heavier. I don't have the specs, but if you're buying it for running/jogging, don't.2. The Nike altimeter is not nearly as accurate, it jumps around much more than the Suunto's.3. The Nike's face, being glass, is more scratch resistant.4. The Nike's strap is bombproof, whereas the Suunto's failed me after 2 years.regards,Greg"
3,OK Watch for avid outdoor enthusiast,I bought the Nike watch primarily for cycling because I wanted to know the temp and climbs while riding. The watch is OK on both though often differs from published elevations; if you wait long enough it will eventually find its way to the right number. Battery expires quickly--fortunately it's the simplest change of a CR2032 that I've ever seen. Compass isn't very intuitive to use.
1,Nike Oregon Series Watch,Brittle!The watch face scratched easily after one day of wear.Combine that with the malfunction of two Lance 4 Oregon series watches (within a few months each) and Nike will get a pass from me in the future with regard to watches. Poorly made with no durability.Every Casio I own keeps running despite years of use and sometimes abuse.
3,"Cool Watch, doesn't live up to claims",Altimeter is not accurate. This algorithem to tell the difference between barometric and altitude pressure differences is just not possible. This watch can be off by as much as 600-700 feet after a front comes though. Otherwise is a pretty good watch.
5,AC and Car Adapter,This product was a great product but due to the fact that Amazon did not ship it in the time period specified I ordered it through another company and cancelled the order from Amazon. I received my product in the 7 days that was promised from another company and it would have taken amazon over a month to get me my product that was suppposed to be delivered in about 7 days.
1,Kidding me!,All those claims of improved reception are a joke. I plunked down over 20 dollars for a splitter that worked exactly like my 2.99 splitter. I guess I should have just taken it off and returned it but you all know what a pain that is. I'll have to chalk it up to experience.Bottom line: Don't believe everything you read. It's probably all just one scheme and sale pitch.
2,IT BROKE,"I owe two of this splitter. Both of them broke when I unscrew the cable, There is a piece of plastic inside the hole broke off."
2,I saw no real improvement...,"I installed a Monster 3-way and 2-way splitter to replace my old ""cheapo"" splitters I currently had. I hoped for the best but I really saw no improvement over the old ones. One caveat: I am using a 1990's tv with no HD. It may make a difference for those higher quality tv's and those with HD but for me it made no visable difference."
4,better than what the cable company gives you,"better than what the cable company gives you, less flakiness then we experienced before. all in all happy with purchase."
4,Great References for Classical & other Western Art,"Excellent explanations of myths, symbols, biblical characters & stories, and classical dieties.Will help (undergraduate) college or high school level researchers immensely. Great for art history students. Actually, since much of the entries are names and stories (Elisha, Pegasus, Granida and Daifilo, bearing the body of Christ), this is perfectly useful to anyone studying and writing about myths, western religion, the Renaissance, or even classical drama.Little idiosyncrasies like a listing for ""garden"" but not for ""Eden"" tend to be a little frustrating, but one generally can find what one is looking for.Nothing in here about Eastern or Oriental art except a handful of Old Testament references that could possibly apply to Islamic culture. This is really a concentration on the roots of Western art and culture."
4,Hall's Dictionary of subjects and Symbols in Art,"I am happy because I got the book I needed, I received it on time, The only objection is that it 's all written."
4,Pretty Decent,"I've owned mine for about 3 years. I an an espresso connoisseur and roast my own beans. Pros for this machine are good build quality, good steaming power and consistently good espresso. I strongly recommend getting an aftermarket 2 HOLE steam tip - critical for making microfoam. FORGET the lame-o plastic frothing attachment. It seems to be make for a Starbucks reject. The drain reservoir is WAY too small. Not a huge issue, but a pain in the a$$. I had my pressure relief valve die on me within the first year, but since then pretty smooth sailing. Try not to pay full retail for this and you'll be happy."
3,Reads too much like a trial transcript,"Looking forward to learning more about this woman so devoted to her causes, whether Charles Manson or the environment, I enjoyed this book up to a point. I found that once the book moved into the period after the assassination attempt, it read too much like a trial transcript and was very difficult to get through. I do not think that word-for-word accounts of the interaction in the courtroom was helpful in understanding the person that is Lynette Fromme. The background information concerning her home life and growing up was very interesting, but the trial itself couldn't hold my attention."
2,A story half-written.,"Bravin has chosen to write a biography of a woman who usually appears as a side character to Charles Manson. What begins promisingly, though,soon turns into another biography on Manson himself, and the realm of information he uncovers about her pre-Charlie life suddenly stops, and we are told little then that we didn't know from ""Helter Skelter"". Unfortunately, fascinating theories about her father are unresolved, and because Fromme wouldn't talk herself, there are no clues to the woman's mind after 20-plus years in prison."
3,"Long Book, Long Overdue","I understand that this 400-page tome took four years to write and research. It feels like it, especially when wading through the tedious courtroom sequences and Ms. Fromme's own obtuse writings. That said, this is a compelling book about an interesting and often overlooked character. Some of the very detailed information is fascinating and some of it could have been left out. More editing would have helped, I think."
2,not interesting,"If you're one of those people who went through a phase where you were trying like hell to figure out why humans like Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme helped turn Charles Manson into a cult leader back in the late 1960s, this book will answer none of your questions. Though it received a lot of great reviews by writers from the best newspapers and magazines, I remain utterly dumbfounded as to why.Anyone who has truly wasted a lot of time digging for any information that can be found on ""the family"" will find this book hollow. Beyond hollow. It doesn't even have an outward form."
5,Track Listing:,Track Listing:1. You Are The One2. Jesus Loves Me3. Promise4. Mountain Top Feeling5. By My Side6. Carousel
5,*Team Rocket*,"*I wanted to get this for obvious reasons; I love Pokémon and Team Rocket! This is the second Pokémon related book I've ever owned since 1999. I got the book today, but I didn't know how bad in condition it would be in. The cover had major wears n tears. Seeing as how it's very old, i'm not too down about it.*"
4,more than practical book,"I got a very good view of many topics related to sports marketing. I would say that Melvin Helitzer gives us a great overview of what a professional needs to know to perform well in the field. It's really great tour to get acquainted with the dream job. The sports world industry deserves professionals to market, communicate and advertise with the flavor Helitzer gives to us readers."
3,Useful but flawed,"Quite frankly, if this is the best reference work on Celtic legends and culture, this only goes to show how very bad the rest are. Other reviewers have pointed out the irrelevant English items and very bad etymology; I would like to add that the book is infuriatingly uneven in its references. Some I have been able to track down; other entries have no origin listed at all, which has resulted, in one case, in a desperate and completely unavailing trawl through EVERY TITLE in the Brittany bibliography - and that for a reference which is absolutely fundamental to my research. I know this particular character and folk-tale exist; they must, because other facts I encountered confirm that they must; but because Mr. MacKillop has not given his source for his description, I am unable to proceed. And that is not the only case in which the entries let me down. It is pointless to write a reference dictionary if you are not going to give references!"
1,Not the ONE :,"I thought I will find some amazing video shoot about the shark, there life,especially hunting,As the title name..I only saw a man feeding a shark and many repeated shoot :<"
3,"Dated, but still interesting","For the Cold War nostalgic in all of us comes ""Nuclear War: What's in It For You?"". It is a non-fiction account of countries that have or are attempting to get nuclear weapons, but it is written in an easy-to-read format. It also outlines scenarios that could have happened, as well as a brief history of US nuclear weapons development.All in all, this book is an interesting and easy read, but very dated."
4,Everything you ever wanted to know about nuclear war....,"I read this book nearly 20 years ago. It attempts to provided an objective description of he history of the cold war, and the development of the nuclear arsenals of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The book contains lots of statistics from non-classified sources and has vidid descriptions on the potential effects of a nuclear confrontation between the superpowers.It's written in a easy-to-read style, targeting the everyday person.If read by someone today, it would seem most of the value of this book would be in gaining some insight into the concerns of Americans and Soviet citizens who lived through the dark days of the cold war 1950's to 1980's."
4,Kid Talk Cards,"Gave this as a gift to my nephew, age 7. Haven't heard a report back from them about how they like it. However, I felt good about my purchase and in giving it as a gift."
4,Fun Stuff,"These cards are a perfect way to bring young ones into dinner conversation. My son (6yrs) is able to read most of the words and enjoys making up creative answers to questions like ""what kind of candy would you invent?"" Our only problem is that he likes it too much and does not eat his food. We have switched this to an after dinner game and use it as a reward for eating well."
2,Don't believe everything you read,"I bought these to use with my kids, but found that they didn't find the ideas at all interesting. Personal interest varies, of course. It seems to me that we have more interesting conversations than the ones suggested in the deck on a regular basis. My main issue with these cards, however, is that many of the ""facts"" listed on the cards are completely incorrect. Don't beleive everything you read, and particularly with this card deck- find out if the ""fact"" it lists is truly a ""fact"". One could take this in an entirely different educational direction than it was intended, but a research project wasn't what I was looking for."
3,:\,"These were ok, card were nice but the questions were not easy they were really in depth, more like something you would use for school instead of fun with friends which I had hoped!"
4,For intermidiates,"If you have some drawing experience, but lack any formal teaching, this may help you. There are more examples than instructions. It very good to copy is drawing to practice the finer lines & other techniques. If you're looking for more instruction &/or you are inexperienced I would highly recommendDrawing for the Absolute and Utter Beginner"
4,Little costy but worked good,"This worked just for what I needed it for, to split standard cable signal.Was a little expensive compared to others but look at the name brand, lolMake sure it supports the signal for what you need. Some people may need ones that go above the 2Ghz but it all depends what you are using it for. For standard cable works great. For cable modem, digital cable or Sat TV, do research for your provider first and make sure it will be fine for you."
2,Didn't Deliver,"I replaced the 97 cent splitter that I bought at the store. I expected better or at the very least the same level of performance. I use this between my computer and TV. My bandwidth dropped from ~2mbs to ~400kbs. I thought I had hooked it up wrong, so I checked it. No dice, I gave it a 2 instead of 1 because it looks nice and my TV picture is the same or a little better. Wish I had my [...] back."
1,Excellent splitter,The dude from Carlsbad got a 4-way splitter (given the specs he/she quotes). Make sure you properly terminate unused outputs on your 4-way.This is a 2 way and works as advertised.
4,Info on Hilary you never knew before!,"This book is pretty good! It wasn't the easiest to read, but had TONS of quizzes, cool snapshots, and information that most people don't know, like Hilary's middle name.(hint: it is not lisa or ann) It also has side schapters about Hailey, Adam Lamberg(Gordo, from Lizzie McGuire), Ashlie Brilliault(who plays kate on Lizzie McGuire), and others of Hilary's Co- Stars. I would reccommend this book to Kids over 9 years of age. It is a great read!"
5,Hilary Duff Rocks!,"Hilary Duff is awesome! Ths book tells about her daily life, her music, her movies, her family, and more! It also includes plenty of interviews of her. And it also talks about her co-stars and best friends. It has some of her beaty tricks in it to. It also has pictures in it, that you can't see anywhere else, and she looks beautiful in them! I want to put the pics on my wall, but that would ruin the book! It's also a very long book, so I spend hours and hours reading it everyday! In the back it has a 'workography' that tells all of her movies and CD's shes been in, and how much money they earned, and it has some stuff about her upcoming movies to! If you are a Hilary Fan this book is a must!"
1,Broke before I even used it,I took it out of package tried squezing it and the casting broke and the metal on the pliers cracked. ABSOLUTE JUNK. ohhh and the cheap plastic handles slip right off...why bother putting them on? Why must products made in the USA be a disgrace to our country??? Also Amazon took 8 days to send it with Amazon Prime I ended up having to use a needle nose pliers that i sharpened to a point...sigh...
3,ok for medium to small rings,"The pliers are cleverly built and looked like a good product, but the center is made out of cast iron and when trying to squeeze a 3"" snap ring the cast iron rounded off and left the pliers useless. Perhaps if you were using them on 1"" or smaller rings they would be a good tool to have in your box."
4,"Very Well Built, Needs Smaller Tips","This is a very well constructed set of American made pliers, and the reversing function is great, but apparently ""Heavy Duty"" also means it's designed mostly for larger snap rings. If you're doing work with 1/2"" or 3/8"" pins the snap rings will likely be too small for the tips that come with this tool.The solution I had was to order a set of the smaller tips for one of Lisle's other pliers: Part number 46250, they are not an exact fit, but they work fine."
4,F as in funny!,"F as in Frank is a new and very funny take on the Werewolf story.Frank is a Boston homicide detective who happens to have a rare form of lycanthropy. Frank is also a loose cannon and his bosses want him out of the department.Frank's new partner is in on the conspiracy against him but would rather not screw over a fellow cop if he can avoid it. Together they try to solve a bizarre murder in the public library while trying to keep Frank from getting fired or killed.This is not your father's beantown either, Boston is just another wild character in the story. After the explosive finale, I really hope that there will be more of Frank in the future."
4,F as in Frank,A brilliant mix of humor and mystery that kept me guessing until the very end. I definitely recommend it!
1,FLOPPY DRIVE FLOPS,"Nowhere on the box does it state that this product won't work on a Mac OS higher than 10.3. Even the disk included in the box says ""no driver needed for Mac OS 10.1 or higher"", leading one to believe it will work even easier if your OS is higher than 10.3. Wrong. How stupid to make a product that is intended to let us continue to use our old floppies, but not if you have the latest operating system. What a waste of time."
4,If you really need floppy discs,"Occasionally I just have to use them, but Macs no longer come with a floppy disc drive This fits the bill and requires no software - just plug in to the USB porrt and its ready to use. It's a bit slow, but perhaps that's just the floppies and they were always slow, it's hard to remember once you get used to the speed of CDs. When I finally use up all my old discs (not long now!) I wan't miss them."
2,Works but has its downside,Works with my Dell Latitude XP Laptop and I can read/write onto floppy disk but does not work with my Dell dockingstation nor can I boot properly with the floppy drive attached to my Laptop USB port.There's no reason why attaching the floppy drive to my dockingstation or laptop prior to boot-up should fail to work. LaCie needs to fix this.
5,Works Perfectly!,"I purchased one of these recently to use (really old) Mac programs on a 2003 G3 iBook running both OS X 10.3 and OS 9.2. I just plugged-in the USB connector and everything worked perfectly . . . didn't even need to install the drivers on the enclosed CD. It's great when something performs exactly as promised, and this little disk drive does! I highly recommend it."
1,Junk,I wish there was a no-star option. I used this on a Mac PowerBook G4. The unit made some whirring noises -- and that was it. It was never recognized by my computer.
1,LaCie External Floppy Drive,"Product did not work out of the box with my iMac, product would not appear in the Finder. This is my second experience with LaCie. The first, 6 months ago, was with a hard drive that failed shortly after putting it on line. I have lost confidence in the La Cie products.J.A.P."
5,Awesome Tags,These were available at a gaming convention in Virginia and were a BIG HIT!!.. Where else can you personalize a tag with your name and your favorite character? No setup fees or anything!
5,Great little map for life.,"Great little book to spend a couple of moments with every morning. Most of the passages I refer to as BRO's ""Briliant Realization of the Obvious"
5,quilter,"This trapunto by machine is all new for me as a quilter of 'art quilts' in my early sewing days, to now when I actually have more time to really do the work. I love this instruction and pratice work decribed in this great book."
3,Cheap Trick^2 1997 out of business out of print,"-not, repeat not the eponymous first album- this is Cheap Trick Cheap Trick 1997. the label releasing this album went under just after the albums release. this makes the album hard to come by. that said the record does not contain any 'anthems' or super-hits but provides the beatlesque melodies we have come to know and love from cheap trick."
3,Best Studio Effort for the Tricksters since The Doctor!,"What a nice surprise to see Cheap Trick on thatconcert on VH1 and to see that great Black andWhite, five-neck guitar cover! This album has7 very strong songs (too bad 'Red Ant' wentbelly-up three weeks after this was released- is this very good band cursed or what?).Much better effort than on Woke Up with A Monster,Busted or even a pretty strong Lap of Luxury. Hey,they even wrote 99% of the material themselves!You guys did us CT fans proud this time! Now ifonly Jon Brant were back in the group...Well, youcan't have EVERYTHING, I guess..."
3,"Solid Cheap Trick CD, very good stuff","Cheap Trick's 1997 ""second"" self-titled release is an excellect album. There are only two songs I tend to skip because they are ""slow"" songs and they don't maintain the power and energy of the others. I love the false-start drums on the opener, and ""Anytime"" is one of my favorite Cheap Trick songs from their entire career. ""Carnival"" should have been a huge hit it's very catchy yet also rockin. I have the version with the extra bonus CD containing two more songs, and they are both very good I highly recommend the two-disc edition if you can find it. So, I really enjoy 11/13 songs on this one. If you like albums including the debut, In Color, Heaven Tonight, Dream Police, and All Shook Up get the '97 self-titled it's another solid CD full of great songs from Cheap Trick. My favorite tracks: Anytime, Hard To Tell, Carnival, Wrong All Along, Eight Miles Low"
5,Serenity Bracelet,"I wanted my spouse to have the Serenity prayer with him always, and this bracelet is beautiful. My spouse wears it every day, and the wonderful words are always there for him to reflect on."
2,disappointing,"i find the engraved text too small, smaller than visualized in the image showncuff is also not so good since it is not adjustable to wrist size. perhaps a bracelet type would be better..."
2,"Yes, cables matter, but...","There are better choices than Monster, look into Kimber or Audioquest cables. For the same price, they are considerably better than Monster. Monster has the lion's share of low-end (read:zip-cord) and entry level hi-fi cables, because of great marketing. Go to any chain store (e.g. Best Buy) and you'll see Monster for sale.Like most things in life, however, if you put a little effort into research you will find better choices, for similar prices. Make sure you buy from a place where you can return the item, however!In my first real eye-opener as to cable differences, I switched from Monster to Audioquest 4's (.. no terminators, just bare wire)and my _wife_ noticed improved sound (she didn't know I'd changed anything)."
5,"The key to a ""GREAT"" sound system","I had just bought new JBL S310 floorstanding loudspeakers and hooked them up to my Kenwood VR-407 with my old Radioshack speakers cable and the sound was pretty good. But when I finally decided to spend the extra money and upgrade to the Monster Cable XPHP 10/10 cable, the sound difference was incredible. The highs were higher and the bass was deeper and tigheter. Anyone who has put a fair share of money into their home stereo system should not hesitate before buying this cable because it is the most worthwhile investment you can make."
5,Great explanations of punch needle technique,"I'm just starting out in punch needle and this book has very clear explanations of the different types of needles, fibers and techniques. The photos are nice and clear and the projects look very interesting."
3,Miniature Punchneedle Embroidery by Linda Repasky,"This is a great book for beginners. It has clear instructions and nice color pictures. There are 11 projects, but they are very tiny! They would make great rugs for in a doll house."
2,Unfortunate reproduction of a great poster.,"The poster is described as a reproduction and you can see in the photo that the source image had been folded, which in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but what you can't see is that there is also a mark in the middle from scotch tape that was placed on the source image. It also is slightly pixelated. All in all it is not a great reproduction of an awesome poster."
4,Angry All the TIme,THis was recommended reading from a seminar I attended. I thought it was on how to deal with others anger. But I still came away with a better understanding of peoples anger. So the book was a good follow up.
5,Very effective,"Get this book if you find yourself experiencing anger!! The author knows what he's talking about and really pinpoints exactly what you are thinking and doing like he just wrote it for you. I went through the book constantly saying ""yep, I do that...I think that way....I treat people that way."" Buy this book and read it, but don't just read it through like you are reading any casual novel. Really think about what he's saying like he was giving you this advice in person. Take to heart every single line and make a committment to change. It's a struggle to change since anger is so deep rooted and habitual, but this book will definitely give you a blueprint for change."
1,Waste of money..,"The author claims to be an expert in anger management, but spends the majority of the book ranting at people who are angry and blaming them (which ironically is the population he's supposed to be helping). Honestly, I think he needs help himself more than I do.So, if it gives you comfort to be blamed instead of understood - feel free to read the book. But, if you want to be understood as well as taking control of your behavior, there are much better books.Another big issue I have with the book is that it deny's the environmental factors of anger, from racism, exploitation, sexism etc.Just says it's all your fault. I'm open to the fact that some of those factors I need to let go - but it's not right to say they don't exist.I considered selling the book on amazon or half to get at least some of my money back, but I Think I would rather burn it since it will be hurting others more than helping.."
5,Controlling Your Anger is a Possibility,"Controlling one's anger is possible and a need; it is a requirement for the good life. In fact, controlling one's anger is an act of love: love of one's self and love of others. Arm yourself with Angry All the Time and ""Anger Management for Dummies"" by W. Doyle Gentry PhD and life could get more enjoyable. According to these authors, I have choices when it comes to anger."
1,Angry!,"This is typical! I'm really ticked off. I look for a book about anger control, and this one has a suitable looking title. Then I find that it's trying to get me to STOP being angry. This de-motivational message gives motivational literature a bad name. A one star score is really not low enough to express the depths of my rage."
1,couldn't finish it,"Maybe it's just me but when I catch a word being misused in the first three pages, I'm not too keen on reading much further...but I did read on for a few chapters only to find another wrong word. One has one's interest ""piqued"", not peaked, one ""wends"" one's way somewhere, not ""winds""....Another problem with reading a novel set in the area in which the reader lives, you are frequently distracted by things that someone in another area might not catch. The surnames given to most of the characters in Alexandria were of French origin. Alexandria is not in south Louisiana where those names are common. It appeared to me that some editor decided the names needed a little cajun flavoring...BAM! as Emeril would say. Too picky? Should I be blaming the editors? Maybe but that's the problem I have..I see those errors and my attention starts to wander...It's possible I wouldn't have liked it anyway but we'll never know."
5,I couldn't put it down!!,"A fantastic first outing for this promsing young author. The book is well-crafted and the dialog is extremely clever. Anyone who has ever wondered what it is like to live in Louisiana, should get this book. I can't wait for the next novel from this talented author."
2,These are NOT Dymo - brand labels.,"Don't be fooled like I was. These are not Dymo-brand labels. They are generic.The product info page lists the Brand as ""Dymo"" but this is not correct. The labels do not come in a Dymo box. They do not have the Dymo logo on the back. They are generic labels. Be warned."
4,Very Pretty Home Decor,I bought this cross as a Christmas present and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived and was actually a pack of 4. They are a nice size and very well made. It is whimsical and would look nice in a young girl's room.
3,Buen libro,Un libro muy util sobre los pasos basicos de etiqueta. Creo que el libro fue escrito hace algunos años y carece de algunas respuestas a preguntas modernas sobre etiqueta. Tambien esperaba algo sobre posturas de etiqueta diplomaticas o de protocolo.Es un buen libro defenitivamente me aclaro algunas preguntas.
5,In a nice place,"This album just ooze's love. What else can I say. If you really listen to it, it can bring you really far away. The first track I heard was the outer banks and I searched for the album straight away, and once I got my hands on the album I never put it down for a few days. I keep finding myself listening to it nearly every weekend. It's what weekends and lazy days were made for. Buy it, enjoy it and play it over and over."
5,inspiring music,"when in a safe place first came out, i remember listening to it and saying to myself, is this it? so i tossed it aside. i recently saw the album leaf at the social. it was incredible. their live show was flawless. i later listened to in a safe place and now i get it. the music is inspiring"
2,Forgettable,"The Album Leaf, a side project of Jimmy LaValle (guitarist for Tristeza and Black Heart Procession), falls somewhere between the ambient leanings of Brian Eno/Penguin Café Orchestra and the pop electronica of Air, without really succeeding in either pole. In a Safe Place lacks Eno's subtlety, Penguin's craft (PCO specialized in simple songs, but when all the harmonies and instruments were in full swing, swirling in and among one another like small-winged insects fluttering near a porch light, believe me, you'd swear that this music was quite complex) and Air's chewy hooks. At its best, In a Safe Place offers pleasant--albeit repetitive--soothing melodies. At its worst, it inspires me to learn how to use sequencing software with my dusty Yamaha keyboard and start penning songs.For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"
2,nothing unique,"The best song is the one with Jonsi from Sigur Ros, but other than that, this album is lacking any sign of originality or expression. To me it's kind of a banal interpretation of the highly creative icelandic music of Mum and Sigur Ros. He doesn't really push anything on this album, just seems to settle for a certain sound already created. I mean, he was invited to record at the Sigur Ros studio and he comes up with this? Sad."
1,Boring Disc of Music,I used to be a big fan of The Album Leaf but this new disc is flat-out boring. The Album Leaf fares much better on the Moog Soundtrack which I recently purchased and the track there is really good. I wish Jimmy would go back to whatever he was doing before. He should stay far away from the Sigar Ros guys.
3,Expected more,"Based on certain tracks I'd heard from Pandora for this collection I assumed the overall flavor would be more multi-layered. It's now clear that the simple musicianship and production for this collection is, well, a bit simple. I like repetitive and sparse work...often a lot, being a lover of post-rock but this falls short of some of the other representatives of the same. Oh we'll, I'll give some other collections from Album Leaf a shot, anyway."
1,melted down mess,Do not buy this product online. Mine arrived with the adhesive melted all over the inside of the box. What a mess. I don't think you could even leave it in a hot car for a while. A building product should be able to survive a ride with UPS.
1,Brings back memories,"In the late 1950's my family received a Filtron Cold Brew Coffee System as a gift Our family enjoyed the coffee extract it makes for a many years. When I went away to school I forgot about the system. Several weeks ago I woke up in the middle of the night and Filtron Coffee passed through my brain. I got up, Googled Filtron and found the system advertised on your site.Ordered the system and have really enjoyed it since I received it. Brings back memories. This 76 year old man is glad he remembered the name Filtron. Good thing coffee doesn't keep me up at night.Thanks,Bob Roth"
5,awesome,The taste is so smooth and clean no after taste and no heart burn. I want to stay home and just drink it all day.
2,Just OK,We did not do as well as most with this cold brewing system. Must be our coffee or water. we are going back to the hot brew.

4,Perhpas the best bet for small businesses,"The DP model of the Phaser 8200 line is the best value. It offers the 1200 dpi photo mode, which yields excellent results and some of the most lifelike prints I have ever seen. Be warned: the printer needs to be kept on all the time (or you lose 1 ink stick each time it is restarted). This inconvenience aside, this is a remarkable machine. It prints very fast, with great 1st page out time (exactly as touted by Xerox) and the same great quality with each print, no degradation. Well worth considering."
2,Don't waste your money,"Before I bought this CD, I thought it looked a little ""light"" on tracks. Once I listened to it, I knew that they had left off at least 2 great songs from the movie. My guess is they left off more than that. So, while the music that's on the CD is good, it's NOT an ""original movie soundtrack"" if it's incomplete. Music companies should not be allowed to make that statement if a disk does not contain all the tracks. So, beware of this purchase if you're looking for the entire soundtrack."
2,Be careful when importing information from TurboTax,"Last year I made the switch from TurboTax to TaxCut. After importing all my data from TurboTax (the box said it would,) I completed my taxes and noticed a strange bug that caused the city and zip of my employer to show up as my own! When I then changed my home address, the address of my employer changed! Good grief. I called TaxCut and they advised me to REDO my taxes and skip the import from Turbo Tax. However, after spending hours entering all my tax info, I opted to just send it into the IRS with incorrect information. It makes me wonder what other bugs TaxCut may have overlooked. You get what you pay for!"
2,Wrong Taxable Income,"I have used TaxCut for the past three years and never had trouble until this year. Be careful to look closely at how TaxCut handles direct IRA rollovers. It pulled the rollover amount (instead of the taxable rollover amount -- $0) in as taxable on my state form. I ended up having to file a hard copy because of this, and went around the block 6 times with the support staff to try and get them to recognize that there was an issue. They never did."
3,Don't know about the product. Amazon's download sucks,"I've used TaxCut for the past 4 years, and have been VERY happy with it. Never had a problem when I bought the boxed disc at Best Buy.This year, I thought I would try downloading, saving the trip to my local BB. Mistake.I paid, had my order acknowledged, and then had to wait 4 hours before the software was ready to download.When I was finally notified that it was ready to go, I tried 8 times on two different machines, with no success.Amazon is great for books, but I will NEVER order downloadable software from them again. It's not worth the wait, especially when the download doesn't work when you're finally notified that it's ready. Doubly so when there are 10 stores where you can get the disc for the same price within a 15 minute drive.I think Amazon is getting overextended."
2,Don't bother - faster and easier to do it manually,"I've never written a negative review before, but I was very disappointed with this program. I sold property this year and there was no instructions on how to fill in that part of the form, so I had to read the IRS instructions and then fill in the actual IRS forms to know how to fill in the dtaxCut forms. Also, I moved from one state to another this year, so I downloaded both states' programs. Only after I downloaded them did it tell me that the programs did not calculate partial year returns and that I would need to fill in the returns manually. Finally, it will not let me e-file because it will not let me program."
4,Worked well for me,"Tax Cut did everything I expected and more. The four stars was only because it was a little difficult to read the help messages and their rebates are a borderline scam (save absolutely all your receipts and retail paperwork, or you may not have what they require for the rebate)... Improvements there would give it five in my book. I'm not sure why all the complaining, Tax Cut worked fine for me."
1,What a mistake,"Like many users, I decided to give TaxCut a try after last year's TurboTax fiasco. Big mistake! Based on other reviews, I was prepared for problems importing data from Quicken and from last year's return, and entering the information by hand wasn't a big deal. But the clunky user interface, hugely delayed state update and other problems are sending me running back to TurboTax. The deal-breaker was checking my federal return a second time and being told there were 7 errors that had to be corrected before filing. (The first time I checked the return, there were-- you guessed it-- no errors.) Nothing changed in between the two reviews: no product update, no new data on my end. TaxCut just gave me wildly different results, with no explanation. Don't waste your time or money on this unreliable product."
2,TaxCut not friendly,"Two distinct problems (seems each year it gets harder to use, and less friendly).a. Overwrote last years files, without warning. Fortunately had a saved copy on a floppy disc.b. Entered state information and could not remove it, when I discovered in a later 'interview' question that I had entered the information in the wrong place. Had to 'force' the entry which then brings up an error in the review.In general, very frustrating to use, and each year it becomes worse, not better. The good days of TaxEdge are gone, and had to convert to TurboTax, which also grew more cumbersome each year, so I switched to TaxCut. This may be my last year with it.No way to give feedback either, unless one would 'pay' $20 to tell of the problem."
1,Horrible Customer Support,"I attempted to buy the state software, but the server was down and could not accept a credit card payment. I have been trying for 2 days now. I tried to call customer support and you cannot unless you pay $9.95. You cannot even contact them through email.I am returning the software."
3,Product not ready,"I am a long time user. To be fair the product has worked well for me for the last 5 years. My return is complex with income from my job as well as rental income. As the product sits today, it's not ready. I have finished my state and federal returns and can't file until taxcut comes up with the updated forms. The message says early February. As of today, the forms are still not available. I wanted to call or email customer service and chew them out, but they took all contact info off their web page. I am going to wait for another week, then return the product and try TurboTax."
1,"TaxCut was a $14,000 TAX HIKE!","Due to a bug in TaxCut, my W-2 form got duplicated. This changed us from having a $7,000 refund to owing $7,000. I didn't catch TaxCut's bug before I e-filed.Now I've got to go file amended returns for both Federal and State. What a nightmare! This thing is supposed to make my life *easier*? NOT!Besides that, the program's just generally buggy."
1,Beware!! Internet security lacking for e-filing.,"Just tried to e-file my taxes with this product. After 2 unsuccessful attempts, I checked their FAQ for transmission problems. (See for yourself at www.taxcut.com/customer_support, then click e-filing, transmission errors, connectivity problems) They recommend disabling your anti-virus software, disabling your firewall and circumventing your router. Apparently, they don't want you to protect your very valuable personal information at ALL!! I'm horrified. These are basics!! If you're going to e-file I recommend looking elsewhere."
4,What product are theses others reviewing.,"My Dad uses turbo tax(he has the paperwork in quickenbooks, dont ask about the problems with that product) and I have been using taxcut so I have had the time to compare the products, and have to question what product the people complaining about the user interface are talking about. I see really no meaningful difference between the two.Personnaly I will stick with and recommend taxcut for 3 reasons1) Does not have a history of installing stupid additional software with it.2) has all the features of turbo tax for the average user(if you are running a buisiness and have a tax consultant go with turbo tax)3) it is cheaper.If you want additional support of have alot of capital gains from stocks get the premium version."
5,"No problems, quicker than TurboTax","After 10 years of using TurboTax, I tried TaxCut this year in protest of TurboTax's invasive anti-piracy mechanism last year. I've been shocked to find out that TaxCut is actually easier to use!TaxCut has an interview system that allows you to quickly skip the steps not applicable to you. It does so by periodically presenting lists of possible conditions that may or may not apply to you, and you just check off the ones that do. Then the interview covers only those. As a result, I think I got through my taxes much faster this year than ever have before. I did both my federal and state, and e-filed, in one evening.My taxes aren't super complex, so I can't vouch for complicated scenarios. But for the average household that isn't running a business or juggling investments, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this."
5,TaxCut is an Excellent Product,"After using TurboTax for years, I finally recognized that Intuit can no longer be trusted, and I switched to TAXCUT. I was reluctant and hesitant but am now glad I did.I found TaxCut to be a very easy to use piece of software that completed my return as easily or more easily than any other tax software I've used. Everything from completion of my returns to electronic filing went smooth as silk. All I had to do was follow directions.I have need for a small number of forms that most people don't use (Schedule C, etc), and was able to find virtually everything I needed in TaxCut. Fine job by the folks at H&R. I'm now a permanent TaxCut customer."
1,difficult and time consuming software,"I have always used turbotax and this year purchased taxcut. What a mistake!!! Had to get the help of my duaghter who is a CPA and we still had problems. This program would not delete the EIC (earned income credit) form from my return although it stated that I was not eligible for it. Took hours to complete unlike turbotax which was a breeze to use. Another frustration is when I went to print out a copy of my returne (I e-filed) and I got a total of 25 pages when filing a 1040, Schedule A (very simple with large medical expenses and some mortgage interest), and form 8863 (educational credits) for one of my children). What a waste of paper and ink!! Will never use it again!!"
1,What a disaster!,"We used TaxCut last year with no problem, but after our experience this year, we won't buy it again. We encountered two serious bugs in the program. At one point, TaxCut refused to believe that we now live in a different state from that in which we earned money last year. The other bug miscalculated our taxable earnings in the state we lived in last year. After six days, we still haven't heard back from TaxCut. Fortunately, we've since bought TaxACT, which worked perfectly and cost less."
1,Not even one star,"This software had us owing over $700.00. We knew something was wrong so on top of the $26.00 I paid for the software I then went to have a tax person look them over for another $30.00. Apparently the software automatically puts numbers in that it shouldn't. Bottom line, we did them over ourselves and got a return of over $2,000.00 which is about our usual amount. I begged my husband to try this software. Never again."
1,Tax Cut Doesn't Cut it,"Tax Cut imported an 1099 DIV form that wasn't mine. It doubled my Schedule C income by including last year's 1099 MISC income when I ran Error Check (This generates errors rather than fixing them). The 2-year comparison sheet wasn't even close on last year's numbers. To get a useful return, I had to delete all previous depreciation expense and then enter it by hand. Depreciation shows up on the worksheets but not on my tax form. This product increases your taxes, makes all kinds of errors and doesn't explain anything so it hard to tell if something that doesn't look right is another Tax Cut goof or really should be there. Give yourself a break (tax and otherwise), don't buy this product."
2,"Were they in a hurry, or what?","Most software vendors have figured out the basics of pagination. TaxCut deluxe, on the other hand, offers you the wonderful 'feature' of splitting your 'for my records' copy in mid line. This product should be labled 'Scotch tape not included.'It would also be nice if it didn't flag errors for forms it somehow decided I needed to file even though there was nothing filled in on them."
1,Importing from Turbo Tax is broken,"Bad piece of software ! I imported from Turbo Tax and found out after filing that they imported my last years data incorrectly!Plus all the stuff the other guys also say are true - bad navigation , confusing layout. Hopefully the filing goes thru the 2nd time without problems .You have to choose between 2 bad products Turbo Tax and TaxCut!"
1,I switched back to Turbo Tax after much trouble with this.,I tried this product last year and had to go out and buy Turbo Tax as well just so I could e-file. I was unable to download the state software and was unable to e-file my federal. The customer support was almost non-existent. Like the other reviewer I tried Tax Cut because I wasn't happy with Intuit's product activation/spyware but Turbo Tax works like a dream and Tax Cut just doesn't. If you want to save some money and print the forms for mailing I suppose Tax Cut might suffice if you're a very patient person but I'd look for other alternatives like maybe the IRS online filing or just use paper forms.
1,DO NOT buy this peice of crap,"If you want headaches , calculation errors and finally rejected returns go for this - I am going to try and return this piece of s****. No customer support to call / chat - they say there is but it hidden somewhere in the website that I cannot find. There is $10 per call and belive me you wil have to call lots of time."
5,Its a great book!,"this book is about a television star who says on christmas eve that christmas is not christmas without children. what a suprise it was to find 4 kids on the front doorstep the next morning. the children on the top floor expresses the way the kids feel growing up as television stars right from the start;when on of them falls down the stairs, and when their father(who is considered mr. master disapears on his yaht. i recomend this for kids ages 9-12."
4,"cool, good construction","Kind of wish it lit up though. It's a bit boring on its own, but a great addition if you already have a little village. much better than the crap I bought (and subsequently returned) from target."
1,NO BUGS,I expected the kit to come with the eggs sack. (Or at a mail in card for FREE egg sacks) This was a disappointment.
1,Disgraceful,"This is a sad, sad day indeed...I was hoping to open my mail box and find a kit complete with praying mantis eggs but, ALAS! There are none to be found!I don't want a stupid kit, I want the EGGS! The only reason I bought this pile was because I was mislead into believing that the eggs were included in the kit.WTF do I need a kit for if I don't have the eggs?It was not until after having my heart ripped out, stomped on, and stabbed with bits of shattered dreams that I read the customer reviews, only to find the ""BUYER BEWARE!"" warnings littering the page.What kind of ponzi scheme is this?!?!?"
2,All of them died!,"We dd a lot of reseach and really thought we knew what we were doing with this product. We had hundreds of praying mantus' hatch, and then all died within about 4-5 days. We did exactly what we were supposed to as far as feeding and care. Maybe just a bad batch?"
3,havent used yet......BUT.......,i was alittle disappointed when i recieved it because I thought it came with a coupon for the eggs like the butterfly kit does....BUT it does not and the additional cost is alot...so my daughter was bumbed out so we will have to wait till next year for this project since its getti.ng so cold already
1,READ BEFORE BUYING - BUYER BEWARE!!,"The reviews for this item aren't the same as the product itself. This is a cool kit and the enclosed materials are really well done. However, it doesn't say that the praying mantis eggs aren't included with the kit. I totally understand that the eggs can't be packaged with the kit since they are alive. What I wasn't expecting was to have to pay another $12.95 to get the eggs. What I really wasn't expecting is that the eggs are only available January-April. So, my daughter spent several weeks of saved allowance on this kit only to find out that she can't do anything with it for 5 months. Really disappointed that this wasn't explained before they relieved an 8 year old of her allowance."
3,Waited a month for this now have to wait for mantis eggs.,"Wasn't sure why Amazon sat on this order for almost a month. I thought being a kit it would include everything you need. But, NO. Now I have to shell out more $$ for the eggs and wait a few more weeks. This is very difficult to explain to a 4 year old. Suppose we can use the ""kit"" to hatch butterflies when we are through with the mantis eggs..."
5,Praying Mantis Kit,"Purchasing this kit was a good investment. I'm planning on buying another two. The picture is very deceiving in the overall size. It actually stands approximately a foot high with a diameter approximately close to an LP record (12"").CONS: I purchased Wingless Fruit Flies as stated by the instructions and knowledgeable pet store employees/owners. Based on the size of the Fruit Flies, they were able to walk through the little openings of the kit's netting and eventually suffered death by thumb. In order for me to keep the Fruit Flies distracted and not think about escape, I sliced a small slither of an apple and tossed it in the kit. That idea worked GREAT! The Fruit Flies were attracted to the apple and that kept them busy eating.NOTE: It appears that some Mantids find the taste of apples satisfying. I'm not sure if it's the fiber or the juice but regardless, they look cute."
5,great educational toy and slightly better than other choices,"I actually liked this version of the butterfly kit more than competitors because it's better made and has all those little things like tweezers, magnifying glass, etc. and a very educational booklet. Although it costs a little to send for the caterpillars, why bother when it's so easy to find caterpillars! (searching for the caterpillars adds another level of education because you need to think of their natural habitats). Enjoy!"
2,High School Band,We played this at our concert and was booed off the stage. They said God is dead after listening to these selections. One band member attempted suicide after the performance seeing as how God certainly couldn't exist after playing this music.
4,Best round ever.,"I had the pleasure of playing several rounds of golf with Robert Brown. As helpful as his book ""The Golfing Mind"" has been to me, his insights and instructions as we worked on my game has been invaluable. I had rarely broken 90 until we started playing together. The best round of my life (83)came in a match with him and a gentleman who for all the world reminded me of Shivas Irons. Perhaps there is a special faternity of great golfing minds and on occassion a neophyte is allowed to witness the wizards at work. The events of that round are burned into my memory and are the standard by which I gauge my game. Thank you Bob."
3,not universal,The cover was not universal in size. It did not fit by spare tire for my Jeep Wrangler. I sent the product back and I'm still waiting to hear back about my refund.
1,Not Universal,"I looked on the package for directions or actual tire specifications but there was none and just the universal fit claim. So, I proceeded to put it on my H3 spare but it tore. Waited a whole week for delivery, really disappointed right now."
2,FAST BUT BAD JOB FOR PROTECTION THE ITEM,"Really desapointed for the pachage, bent and damage, the bottle of perfum cover of sticky finger print, Well not possible to offer in this CONDITION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not What Was Expected,I bought this two years ago and it still sits in the closet. The instructions were boring and the patterns uninteresting. My daughter never even finished one. The acrylic yarn is also cheap.
1,it came as learn to knit,very disaponted this product came as learn to knit. I called and they said they would send the right one to never hear from them agian.so i guess my daughter can learn to knit even thought thats not what she wanted to do.
1,ALONE IN A HAUNTED HOUSE,"I UNFORTUNATLEY BROUGHT THIS DVD THINKING IT WOULD BE QUITE GOOD, BUT ALL IT CONSISTS OF IS A MAN WITH A FEW INSTRUMENTS WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN AND GUESS WHAT- ABSOULOUTLY NOTHING! TOTALLY BORING AND DISAPPOINTING AND A WASTE OF TIME."
3,Could have been better,"Well i'll start with the good. This DVD is actually pretty interesting and the ghost hunter knows all his tools very well. He talked/showed a lot of things that i've never seen before. I was very entertained and the movie was easily able to keep my attention for the whole 25 minutes. There is also a few creepy scenes to boot.Now the bad... First of all, this movie is way too short. Should have been at least an hour. Also, had I been the one creating the DVD, I would have made sure to include something more concrete then just some ""orbs"" (looked like dust particles to me) and clammering sounds on a tape recorder. I also would have included some kind of special features.This movie is not worth the near 25 dollar price mark... for 25 minutes this movie should be 10 bucks in my opinion. But hey, if it ever does go down that low, then its a great buy! Rent first like i did though."
1,What a gyp!,"Yes, I'm mad! But as I always cope by looking for ways things could've been worse, at least I paid the Amazon.com discounted price for it. Because if I'd have paid $27.95 for this thing like the producers of this DVD wanted...pissed off is not the word. This was a GYP. Gyp, ya hear me - GYP! If Mr. Warren was only gonna show me insects getting caught in a light & call them orbs...or spend too bloody much time explaining the workings of how his equipment operates...you'd think SOMEBODY would have advised him to stretch the time a little more. At least STAY in that house UNTIL YOU CAME UP WITH A GHOST. Please, future filmmaking salespersons - DON'T do this kind of thing again. It was highway robbery. -J.G."
5,Great Reference Guide,"I have grown to love Microsoft's Pocket Consultant books. They are small and packed with great quick-referneces, how-to's and terminology about the product. The Exchange 2000 continue's with that. I own the one for Ex5.5, and as soon as I saw the Ex2000, I got it, and haven't thought twice about it. Well worth it's cost."
4,Great How-to,"The book doesn't go into too much depth on Exchange but it is a great little how-to book on many of the tasks that Exchange Admins will have to do when they install and maintain Exchange. I would highly recommend this as a quick reference to those of you who are familiar with Exchange, however, you might try a different book if you really want to get in depth though."
3,"Predictable and boring, except for a brief exciting part.","This book had one brief, exciting moment, but for the most part it was slow moving, predictable, and boring. It is about the adventures of a young girl in 15th century Africa; in spite of the plot faults, it is extremely well researched."
4,A lot happens in 30 minutes!,"An interesting short film about a gay older writer near the surfing beaches in Australia, well away from his dying lover in the States, whose home is suddenly crashed by one of the physically striking surfers he has been admiring from afar, with a beer in his hand and only a towel around his waist. What to believe? What to do?Unfortunately the DVD-R the film is recorded on (rather than a typical commercial pressing) comes loose from the spindle and arrives scratched. My original and the replacement were terribly scratched. Also, the DVD just begins, with no typical menu."
4,"good, quick reference","A handy book when you need to know the difference between jacquard and damask, for example, though I wish there were more pictures for visual reference. Succinct definitions and coverage of major fashion and design terms. All in all, a good addition to anyone's collection of fashion reference books."
3,My first book about fashion,"I recently became interested in fashion, and I think that this was a good book to start me off with. It was fairly informative, but not very detailed. Also, there weren't many pictures of the various designs/designers that were mentioned. I think this is a good book for beginners, but perhaps not enough detail for someone with former knowledge of the fashion world. I LOVE the Body Map illustration on page 38 (did anyone actually WEAR that?!?)"
2,Mediocre novel about assassination...,"""American Quartet"" is the first of the Fiona Fitzgerald mysteries, and while Fiona is a great character, this is not a good novel. The Quartet in question are the 4 Presidents that were assassinated. Apparently, someone is copying their murders, and it is up to Fiona to stop him before he gets to the fourth, and biggest killing in the Quartet. Over-the-top, with villain who ejaculates with holding a gun."
2,3x Magnifying Mirror,"Some of the mirrors are not optically ""perfect"". These mirrors magnify because they are curved. The problem is that if they are not curved perfectly, the magnification changes as you move around. My wife dislikes the one she ended up with. I have noticed that some magnifying mirrors are now advertised as ""optically perfect"", which indicates other people have had the same problem. My wife gave one of the mirrors to a friend, who is happy with hers - so I do not know if only some are poorly built. It may have been built by the same company that built the original Hubble telescope."
1,Terrible - but amusing,"This is a completely stupid film that makes very little sense and has uniformly bad acting (not that that is the actor's fault really, given the script). It bears no resemblance to the Rider Haggard classic. However, it is quite unintentionally amusing and to give her her due, Sandahl Bergman is, at least to me, the sexiest ""She"" to date. Worth watching on a wet weekend if you are at a loose end and you don't take it in any way seriously. If you laugh at it, it actually becomes quite bearable."
1,bad...thats all,This belongs in the top ten worst films of all time. Watching this movie you can actually feel your IQ points dropping.
1,laptop battery,i purchase a toshiba battery and send me a replesement not toshiba brand like they spessified.
4,"Come on, it's not _that_ bad!","[...] Like most every guidebook I've seen, this one has trouble integrating routes with their location on the surface of the earth. You'll probably need to bring a USGS topo map along with this book. The authors provide a PG/R/X ""protectability"" rating, along with a 0-3 stars quality rating. They cover some of the premier alpine route in Tuolumne, like Cathedral Peak and Mount Conness, though I'd like to see more of these.Let's face it, almost every guidebook out there sucks in serious ways, and this one's not immune. But the reason that there isn't much competition to this guidebook is the fact that this one is so complete. They've probably got around 1000 routes listed."
1,"Same old, Same old","Same old mistakes as previous versions, same old clumsy ratings. What the hell is ""PG"" supposed to mean? Why are the same climbs denoted with an alpha and numerical listing??? If you do not own a copy, it is a ""must have"" but only because you do not have a choice!!"
4,Repeat Mission,"It is a funny and fun game, but the repetitiveness gets a little . . uhm. . .repetitive.It is a great novelty game though.Exactly what it is made for.Graphics: 4 of 5 It is meant to be cartoon likeGame Play: 3 of 5 a lot of simple tasks put into a gameStory: 4 of 5 follows a pretty unbelievable story, but good none the less.Re-playability: 2 of 3 Once is good enoughOver all: 4 of 5 Just keep in mind, ""It is a novelty game, that is all."""
3,good price for basic desk calendar,great price. very basic calendar. only problem was that i received it bent. they did not ship it in a hard envelope.
4,Great Scent,Once I found this scent at Walmart I was hooked. The Price is the main reason. I get the same fragrance for a ton less. Other knock off don't compare.This one is good.
5,Best investment for my boat,"I have a 19' Javelin bass boat. Originally had 175 hp engine but the person I bought the boat from had changed it to a 200 hp mercury. With the heavier engine my boat was a nightmare to trim out and porpoising was terrible. I installed the SE 300 and what a difference! Hits plane in seconds, porpoising is gone, and the boat will stay on plane at a much lower speed now. Do not know if it hurt the top end because I have not had this boat flat out ( it's a wife thing ) but at 60 mph with plenty of throttle left the boat is rock solid and turns like a Corvette. For me this was the perfect solution to my problems, your experience may be different but if you are experiencing any of these problems this is a very affordable solution. Did not use the clip, bolted directly to the engine because I have no intention of ever taking it off. I am absolutely thrilled with this product."
1,Still Waiting for my order after 2months!!!,I am still waiting for my order! I can not find any contact details so can not follow up. I am very dissapointed! Somebody should contact me ASAP!!!!
3,Great,A great machine. The internet is very fast. The quality of the video is decent and the sound that this baby puts out is above average for a labtop.
2,hardware issues!!,"I have this computer at work - and in the two years we have used it, the motherboard has gone out, as well as the hard drive. Luckily, it was still under warranty both times we've had to repair it, but I would be nervous to purchase one as a personal computer at home."
1,Dell Laptop,"This Dell Laptop was purchased through someone other than Dell. It started having problems from the moment it was opened. I took it to work with me and prevailed on a technician there. He ended up completely rebuilding this laptop in order to make it functional. The laptop we now own is no longer the one purchased as ALL the parts have been switched out for their reliable counterparts. Only the original ""shell"" remains of this purchase. I would NOT recommend this product be purchased from Technisource - from whom I purchased."
2,not good,i bought one laptop and it lasted about 10 days before it had problems( hard drive) so i sent it back and they sent me another. it worked better and for a longer time but within 45 days the hard drive was not found by the computer so when asked to return it the company said that they replaced it once and wouldn't be replacing it again.i didn't get any answer from amazon about the problem.
1,"Dude, don't get a Dell","You are better off building your own computer out of parts from the 80's because that's basically what you will be getting. Where to start with what is wrong with Dell, customer support (they will argue with you), hardware failure (if it works right the first time count yourself lucky), the motherboard - you get what you pay for remember that, and if you do not upgrade then there will be NO slot available for upgrading later, and the funny thing is that it will work for about four months then the problems start. And as for their printers, RUN don't walk away, RUN far ans fast."
3,"Very Cute, but Time Consuming","This was very cute, but took three weeks to get to me! By the time I got it, I only had ten days to finish it. Between school and work, I was up until two or three o'clock every morning working on it. I still didn't get it finished until two days after I needed it. I would suggest that you order it at least six weeks ahead of when you need to get it completed by."
2,Very Low Flow,This shower head does not put out enough water for the shower massage feature to even do anything. I regret that I bought it. It takes twice as long to get a shower now
3,Cool game for beginners,It is a very fun game for starters. once you pass the first 5 asignments you pretty much know everything the plane does.
2,"Decent graphics, but horrid physics","If you like to kill things and want to control something that claims to be an airplane, but does not have flight control, then this may be for you. My primary gripe with the game is that I want the joystick to control elevation and ailerons. Instead, it controls elevation and some wierd combination of ailerons and rudder. The bottom line is the controls do not allow for a roll. If you are upside down from a 1/2 loop, and you want to get right side up, you have to do another half loop.And, that is not how a plane flies."
2,Fun game - broke within the first 3 days,We had never heard of this game before but it sounded fun. My son was excited to receive the game as a gift. I gave it to him as something new to do while we travel on spring break. It lasted less then 3 days and then it broke. A real bummer because the game seemed really fun to him.
3,Name Brand Quality,"In terms of home audio, you won't really notice a difference with the cables. you probably won't notice your audio isn't as clear and crisp as it should be, and if you do notice, you'll blame the receiver, the speakers, the source, but not the cables.Everyone knows Monster is the standard for good, name-brand quality. They've always sounded perfect for me.It all depends if you're willing to take the risk of a no-name for the price difference."
5,WOW,"Simply one of the best doom metal CDs released. A good combo of melodic death metal and doom metal put together with great riffs, and great vocals. Just listen to ""Distress"" and you'll see why."
5,Great Quality at a Great Price!,I am very pleased with the overall performance of this set.I had a dinner party and really wanted to impress my guests with my cooking. While I was preparing the meal I couldn't believe how excellent the quality of the cookware was at such an affordable price. The handles were extremely comfortable to hold and looks elegant in the kitchen. The meal tasted delicious and my guests were very satisfied.
1,Poor quality for the money,"The first time I used this set I was not at all happy with it. No matter what I cooked on them or how much butter or oil I used, the food always stuck to it. They also discolored the first time I used them. I was cooking on a low heat and they still turned a bronze color. I tried to use different stain removal methods and different cleaners but nothing worked. I ended up sending them back."
5,I loved it!,"As a first-time mother who hadn't considered breastfeeding until my daughter was born, it just felt like the natural way to go. As we had encountered our first tough night, and couldn't calm our crying daughter, I wondered, was it something I ate? I frantically searched the web for help, and decided I needed an entire book on the subject. I ended up with several books, and this one was the quickest and easiest to read through. It has lists of possible ""gas-producing foods"", and ""cow's milk-containing foods"" that helped solve our problem. It was very down-to-earth, and explained everything I needed to know to help me understand how to best feed my daughter. She is now 8 months old, still breastfeeding (and on some solids), and is the happiest baby I know. Thank you!"
1,Don't be fooled!,"Even though under ""Customers who bought this book also bought:"" a few titles come up regarding the musical. THIS IS NOT THE MUSICAL! This is an instructional SEX tape. What a disappointment when you send it to someone who is part of the musical.... maybe a little product discription could help?"
1,Not a great film to watch with your parents,"Just to warn everyone this is DEFINATELY not the musical version!!! I was in the musical Anything Goes last year, and had tried to order a copy of the old musical. This tape was sent to me and as a 15-year-old freshman in highschool, and I am sure that you can imagine my parental units were not too happy that I was sent a porno. So, just beware what you order!!!"
1,Let Customer know what they are getting,This appears to be the musical if it isn't you need to let customers know that up front that this is not what they think they are ordering
2,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","The DVD is a good idea, but poorly executed. There is NO INSTRUCTION. The girls just start doing moves and expect you to catch on. The routines are technical and repeated. But forget about showing a move, then adding on. They just do it and expect repetition will teach you. Very frustrating.But if you are looking for something different and don't need instruction, then buy this video. If you need instruction and a real workout, don't buy this.I had high hopes for this DVD. It did not live up to my expectations."
4,Good for Beginners,I have both the Cheeracise videos and I do not understand why there is a twilight version. If you compare the two twilight comes up short but it does have its good points. If you are not a dancer or if you need a hand it is excellent for practice. It goes over the routines enough times that anyone should be able to pick it up.It is also labeled correctly to give you an understanding of what type of workout you are getting. Overall not a bad buy.
3,Ed Van Fleet,"Not what I expected. The music is different from his other CD's, you have to get used to it. Not real happy w/ the purchase."
5,Concise and Relevant in the Church Today,"Bob Slosser's ""Miracle in Darien"", a story about a small church in Connecticut coming alive in the Holy Spirit is a must read for anyone interested in church development and empowerment in the Spirit. The tale of Fr. Terry Fullam's own spiritual journey and how he empowers the people of a typical Episcopal parish to come to the Spirit is not just enthralling storytelling, but could be used as a guide for small parish development. Slosser makes the process of surrendering control of the church to Jesus seem to be the only way to engage in the church. He also outlines the pitfalls and failures that will happen. The way in which we all try to control our lives and churches for our own ends, rather than letting God control both is brought vividly to life in this book. Every vestry or lay council in every Christian church, regardless of denomination should be embrace this book as essential to their mission and discovery."
2,"For me, it was waste of momey","I wanted to learn chords for keyboard so purchased this one but this was not what I was looking for. Tried to use it for a week or so but I finally gave up and purchasedChord Approach to Pop Piano Playing (Complete): Piano Techniquewhich I used for a long, long time. I should have returned it, but still somewhere in the house covered with dust."
1,POOR,"I bought this cable on 2/28/2007. The product was advertized as ""in stock"". After not receiving the cable or an email I wrote the vendor on 3/29. I received a response which stated they are not in stock but I should receive one within three weeks.This is the first time in 5 years that Amazon has failed to deliver as advertized. I am surprized at this uncharacteristicly bad service.George Bennett"
3,Close but no cigar........,"Yes, the book does covers most every WIN32 API fuction call, but fails to leave out some pretty important information. For example, the book describes in detail the function anv various parameters and datatypes used by the function, but leaves out which LIBRARY .dll to use with your call.Now I'm not a C++ code jockey, but I would have expected the book to identify which .dll needed to be called instead of indicating which C++ include file (wingdi.h) the function uses.Other than that, the book is very well written and organized."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,"You can save your money, becuase no one needs such a book. This book contains very simple description of most popular API's. MSDN has same documentation and even better than this book. The book has poor explanation for every API comparing to the MSDN."
5,"I'm sorry, this is just THE best.","I originally bought this book (online mind you, having nothing but the title, page count and a few vauge reviews) with the intention of learning how to control windows with the SendMessage function, but was disappointed to find it full of mostly the drawing part of the WinAPI.But after sitting on the shelf for a few months, it's come back to teach me soooo much about the Win32 platform and C++ programming for it. I went from being an amature console C programmer to a hot GUI, interactive and not to mention much more efficient (with tips on threading and spawning from the book) Windows coder. I'd pay for it thrice if I had to. If you're tired of VB for your apps, this is the transition point for you into V/C++ and/or ASM Win32 coding. This book is Win32."
1,Thick lens but thin facts,Too much lofty theorizing - only for readers with little real exposure to India's complexities.
5,A relaxing and educational video,I found this video very informative. You come away with a better understanding and appeciation of the Big Cats.
3,"Book is nice, music a bit of a problem","The illustrations in this book are nice, and my daughter has enjoyed the book for almost a year now, but the music that plays doesn't match up with the number of syllables in the lyrics in a few spots, so you have to crunch some words together to keep up with the music. Also, the music only plays long enough to get you through half of the book, so you have to close & open the book again to make it play again. The biggest problem, though, is that you can't change the battery. We have other board books that play sounds and they all have a way to replace the batteries. We've been listening to a grossly out-of-tune version of the song for awhile, due to low batteries. Finally, I couldn't stand it anymore and left the book open in the basement for a couple days to run the battery down completely. We'll see if my daughter still likes it without the music."
4,ok but not best,this is an ok cable but is not very cheap. you can get much cheaper cable. the cheaper cable is about as good as this one too. so check around first before buying this cable
4,thank you,"My mother recently passed away, and for the three last years that I was caring for her, she didn't know my name, have any understanding of where she was, or have any idea why this was happening to her. Any book that can describe the love and the frustration that accompany caring for a person with Alzheimer's as well as this book can, is a valuable read to anyone presented with this situation.thank you"
3,A Lopsided Memoir,"As a caregiver myself, I have long had an interest in memoirs by others who have had to deal with the heartbreak of Alzheimer's disease. I also had read an article about the author in the Chicago Tribune several years ago which piqued my interest. That said, I thought this was a lopsided book in that about two-thirds of it (more than 200 pages) focuses on the author and his wife's courtship and life together before the onset of her Alzheimer's disease in the 1990s. Included, often verbatim, are numerous letters they wrote to each other in the 1940s. While this might be of interest to family members and descendents, it held no interest for me and I skipped most of the letters and skimmed much of this part of the book. Unfortunately, the part of their lives affected by Alzheimer's disease gets short shrift; I have read better memoirs on the subject."
5,Toaist Priest is another great release by Hugo Race,"Hugo Race has been making warped blues based techno, jazz influenced space rock for over 25 years. He was first a member of the Original Birthday Party with Nick Cave, then formed the best blues based 80's band in Australia, The Wreckery. After a couple of great albums, Hugo left for a solo career of over 10 albums ranging from punk based blues to German Techno to pysch-folk. This new release combines alot of his previous styles and still forms a coherent album. If you are a fan of Nick Cave, The Triffids, Karma County, Blackeyed Susans, Beck, Neil Young or the Cure, this is where all of these bands combined ended up...Fantastic"
2,Disappointing,"If you're planning to move to Brooklyn and you have no idea which neighborhood you'd like to live in this book might be for you -- otherwise, don't bother! The author doesn't go beyond the basic stereotypes for each neighborhood, i.e. ""Greenpoint sure is clean! All those Poles!"" or ""Williamsburg is full of artists!"" and the bar, gallery, and restaurant listings are very out of date. I think ""real"" Brooklyners (not me!) would be even more disappointed than I was with this book."
3,I was grateful there was a guide to Brooklyn,"that wasn't all about Manhattan. I mean, Manhattan is so over... Brooklyn it is! There aren't many guides to just Brooklyn!"
2,"Uh, Hello... Where are Mill Basin & Bergen Beach???","Two major Brooklyn neighborhoods, Mill Basin and Bergen Beach are misssing from this book. This is a typical result of the recent gentrification ""Yuppie Invasion"" in Park Slope/Green Point/Downtown Brooklyn. These two neighborhoods must be too blue collar, and far away from Manhattan, and so get overlooked in this book. A sad and glaring ommission."
1,beware: fragile,"I wanted a drive to move files from work to home etc, but this isnt it. It crashed within a month. The design seems fragile. LaCie (to their credit) replaced it within a week, but I'm convinced this is really a stay at home unit."
2,It has packed up in less than a year of use,Bought this thing last NOvember. Awkward to carry arround with so many wires and adaptors. Found it very slow.Now suddenly it will not function. Keeps telling me its corrupt!!!.I have to return to Amazon.
2,Major design flaw,"I've had this drive for a year now. I've used it with all permutations of PCs & Macs and laptops & desktops and FireWire & USB. For USB on both platforms and for FireWire on PCs, you'll need the power adapter, which is a poorly designed cheap-o part--it timidly plugs into the unit. The problem is that it disconnects frequently and unpredictably from the hard drive. Unfortunately for me, it did this while I was saving an important file, which, along with a few directories, were lost forever. They seem to have corrected this issue with their new disk drives, and I recommend you avoid this still overpriced drive."
2,Not that good,The 15% leg meat raised this from a 1 to a 2 but overall this product isn't very good. It has a vague crab like flavor but the texture is not anything like fresh crab. I can buy decent fresh crab meet at BJs for $13 for 16 oz of crab meat (Sam's has the same for $16) There is 4.25 oz of crab in the 6 oz can so this is cheaper (~$9/lb) but I don't enjoy eating it.
3,good enough,"For the price, it is good enough. Crab is very expensive and this is quite reasonably priced. I made crab cakes, and next will try a salad."
5,Moog ball joint,Ball joint is of great quality. Purchasing it here saved me 35% off local auto parts storeTook longer than I thought it should have.
2,Not new at all,"I ordered two these to replace a worn out set of stock parts on my Explorer Sport. As a long time Amazon user, I anticipated rapid shipping and a quality product. The shipping, at least, was as expected. Both parts, however, were clearly refurbished or customer returns - dirty, dinged up, and poorly lubricated. I expected better from Amazon."
1,Wrong Product!!!!!!!!,"Amazon's Tool to select front ball joints for 2000 F250 superduty diesel trucks is wrong. I had to return this and the matching; K6664 are wrong. I returned them, worked with Moog to find the correct parts and reordered them."
1,Qualityand function of the product,"Quality of manufacture very poor.Quality of reception VERY poor.Automatic Frequency control has no affect.No segreation of band reception- walk over all frequencies such as FM intruding on Shortwave.Unable to receive any of advertised bands such as Air Traffic, Emergency or Weather.Am returning this product because it is useless. NO STARS"
3,color,I was not pleased with the (grape) color it looks like a burgundy color. To me grape is purple. perhaps you should check them
2,Craftsmanship Sub-Par,"The slippers looked and felt great. I gave them to my 15yr old son as a gift. However, within 1 week, the stitching came loose from one of the slippers around the sole. I had to take them to a shoe repair shop and have them stitched again(both of them) for an additional $8.00."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,MADE IN CHINA...that should tell you something about the product. Only the upper flap showing in the picture is 100% sheepskin...the inside where it touches your feet is actually polyfibers. Very nice spice color and good sole but very disappointed that the inside is NOT sheepskin. Why not make the inside with sheepskin and the outside part with the fake stuff??...just shows how backward our society really has become.
2,Way Too Narrow!,"These are very nice slippers, but much too narrow! My husband always wears a 10 medium and these were too narrow for him. They can't stretch out as you wear them, because the very firm soul is simply made too small. And they aren't offered in a wide. Be very cautious with these."
1,not ready for prime time,"Poor construction, uncomfortable andnot worth the money. The materials advertised stirred the mind with hopes of warmth andpractical leisure. The price was presented as something special. At $20 less it would still be overpriced. These types of products make online shopping a crap shoot and will eventually destroy the trust that it needs to be sustained."
4,Very warm...,"The slippers looks just like the picture. It's soft and comfortable and very warm. My husband has large wide feet (size 15) and these fit him perfect with a pair of socks on. Without socks they were a little big but that's ok because it made it easier to put on. The soles of the slippers were hard so you could use them if you went out. And to me they do not look like ""House"" slippers. It was a good buy and a good find as a Christmas present."
5,Very warm and durable slippers.,"I actually ordered these while on a deployment in afghanistan, and i wore them constantly. They are very very warm, look very cool, and are tougher than nails. i worked for over a week straight in these slippers, because my boots were soaked from the rainfall. i climbed on roofs, carried heavy stuff, and lounged all in these slippers... they are an outstanding buy, and i would most definitely recommend these to anyone. They dont really make good year round slippers, when i returned to san diego it was far too warm to wear these, so that should be taken in to account for these."
5,good product,"very well made, good solid sole for outside, ultra comfortable to wear...both warm and substantial. One thing...I ordered a size 8 and it is just a bit too big . This is really an excellent product for the price."
1,Wrong size and USED,"Ewww. Bought these during the Gold Box deal in men's size 12 for friend's birthday. Box said size 12 which is what I ordered, but the slippers inside were marked size 11. Even worse, they were USED. They did not have the original bags inside the box, the slipper soles had wear and some dirt, and the inside had toe and foot imprints on the footbed. Yuk. Luckily I was able to return them for a refund, but disappointed not to have the gift I planned and that Amazon would ship out a used item."
5,Best moccasins.,"If you want to have warm feet in the house with the option of walking outside to get the morning paper or work in the garage or garden, buy these moccasins. My husband & I have been wearing them for years and purchase new ones only when they get too soiled and the interior sheep's wool gets too matted. These are the best. Enjoy."
1,Disappointed,"Most of the fur has pulled away and has fallen off on the base of these slippers after only 3 weeks. What is left is a ""rubber"" type of material where the fur has pulled away. I am now forced to wear socks while wearing the slippers. If I don't the inside base of the slippers become......... Well, slippery. Not what I expected from a $60 pair of slippers."
3,Not that great,"I bought these for my husband for xmas, and we are not happy with them. There is barely any cushion in the bottom, the lining is only 50% sheepskin. The rest is acrylic, which makes your feet sweat. I bought a size up per other reviews of them running small and they were still too small. For this amount of money I expect the product to be a lot better. Needless to say, these are going back and we'll be sticking with our tried and tested Qwaruba's."
2,feet still chilly!,"these slippers look so warm & cozy, but my husband's feet are still chilled when wearing them. they weren't cheap, so I am disappointed. also, i would suggest anyone purchasing these order at least a 1/2 size up. unfortunately, there was no mention of this in the product description, so not only are my husband's feet still cold, but now they are a bit cramped, too!"
4,Shearling Cuff Boot slipper,Bought these for my husband and he says they are the best slippers he has ever had. The fleece inside molds to his foot and he loves them!
2,disappointed,I got these for Christmas but the toe box is very narrow in these slippers. I sadly enough had to return.
2,Disappointed: not true sheepskin,"As another reviewer noted, these Tamarac by Slippers International ""shearling"" slippers are not 100% sheepskin-lined. Only when the slippers arrive do you see on a sticker on the soles that the lining is 50% acrylic. This should be clearly stated in the product description on Amazon."
3,Why not say the truth?,"It feels and looks good. I took off 2 stars as it present itself as a sheep skin slippers, it is really only 50% sheep skin according to the small letters on the tag on the slippers..."
1,Very unhappy with this purchase.,"I read tons of slipper reviews before purchasing these. A lot of the reviews for other slippers said that the slippers weren't true to size, but these slippers had much better ratings especially about being true to size. My husband has a size 7 foot so I ordered a size 7 and he couldn't get them on because of his high arch. They may have fit length wise, but that doesn't matter if he can't get them on. Also, the shearling cuff on one side of each slipper was glued in place without enough shearling to cover the glue. It looked very cheap. I sent them back immediately and received a full refund (thanks Amazon!)."
2,Run Small,"I bought these for my father for Christmas in his normal size, but they were too small. If you purchase these, make sure you order a size larger."
2,"Great to start, but declines quickly","I received these slippers last year, and did love them when I first started wearing them.A year later today and there are quite a few problems.While the outside of the slipper has held up, even with occasionally walking outside with them. The inside bottom of them has pretty much worn out to the stitching. All the nice comfy warm padding it pretty much gone and these are only worn for a few hours each day around the house.The biggest complaint however is these things flat out stink. My feet do not sweat that much but it didn't matter.I've tried washing them with no success, using powder, etc. They just smell and will be going in the garbage.Rather disappointing for a $60 slipper."
3,Very nice slipper BUT...,"Unfortunately we had to return these slippers as even though we ordered a size larger that normally worn, they were too small. These slippers are well made, seemingly comfy and cozy but run small and VERY narrow."
4,TOO MANY TYPOS.,"Strictly from a student's perspective, this is a good textbook in real analysis. The way the material is presented is logical, whatever that means, and consistent. The author doesn't assume a student knows much and you can never go wrong with this assumption. However, this book has TOO MANY typos, so if you've never seen this stuff before, it's not easy to follow. Don't trust this book. Hopefully, next edition will fix this problem. This is a good book and it can become a classic, but, first, they have to correct all the typos. For those, who want a really good book in Analysis which has no typos, I recommend Rudin, ""Real and Complex Analysis""."
5,Great book,"What I like most about the book is its concise but broad coverage of the fundamentals of real and functional analysis. Although I am not a mathematician, my main interest is solving various engineering problems using numerical methods. A solid background in real and functional analysis would be necessary for deeper understanding of various numerical methods. I wish I had known this book the first time I felt the need to study basic modern analysis. This books has exactly the material I wanted to learn.In addition to the theorems and proofs, the author tells you why some theorems are important and how they can be used (of course also in a concise way). I found this type of ""hints"" are extremely helpful. The historical notes at the end of each chapter are also interesting to read."
4,good book...,"My knowledge of this book originates from a course in measure and integration theory a couple of years ago. Back then I honestly didn't like the book very much. It is very terse, sometimes tending towards incomprehensible. The exercises were great though - hard. Exercises should be hard - that's the best way to learn mathematics.Anyway - since then i have come to like the book more and more. Whenever I'm wondering of a definition or theorem I often find it in this book presented in a precise and rigorous manner. No redundant or unnecessary information is given - just exactly what I'm looking for. The book is perfect if you have a basic knowledge of a subject and want to fresh your memory or expand your mathematical horizon.BUT as first time reading the book is almost useless. This, in particular, is the case for chapters 5,6,7,...,12. These chapters are close to incomprehensible if you haven't got a basic knowledge of the subjects allready."
5,Lock On Gold,Great sim. Note it will not upgrade to Lock On Flaming Cliffs v1.12b it will update to version 1.1 this somewhat inhibits the online play as a lot of online gamers use the 1.12b. here are servers that do use the 1.1 version but as stated many use the 1.12b version.
5,Lock On Gold,This is a game for my husband and he says. . .This just the kind of battle game I was looking for. Unfortunately I do not have the full recommended video memory so it does not play as well as I had hoped.Otherwise evrything is fine.
5,This SIM ROCKS!,"Like posted in my discussion.If you are looking for an arcade game, get Ace Combat.If you want some real engaging fun, this game rocks.If you want the most from this game, get a HOTAS and pedals. Even TrackIR."
4,Great game for serious simmers only!!!,"This is a incredible game (it's not even a game really). The radar is very realistic (able to beam and notch the pulse doppler effect, you are able to change the pulse repitetion frequency, and much more). The flight charactoristics are awesome in the Su 25 and 25t. The US missiles leave much to be desired, but oh well. If you get this game, you MUST get teamspeak and hyperlobby and a headset and play online.This game rocks, however, you will be spending more money on a joystick. :)"
1,Garbage,"The only reason I have one star on this review is because Amazon would not allow me to enter no stars.I bought one of these on a whim years ago when I didn't know any better. Not only is it a useless, underpowered piece of junk; the one that I bought died after just a few months of use. And I wasn't playing it regularly either. I would just hook it up every so often for about a minute at a time to test out electronics and wiring. If you want something cheap and you don't care about the sound, go to a music store and get a $45 Fender twin amp or something. This thing is just the biggest waste of everything in the history of wasting things that you don't want to be wasted."
1,my headphones are louder...,"Don't be deceived by the picture, the amp is actually much smaller than it seems to be from the picture. I bought this amp for my little brother for Christmas and I felt so stupid when he started playing on it because it sounded so awful. If you want minimal sound quality and volume then buy this amp. But your best bet is getting something worth giving."
1,"Pyramid and ""Peak Power""","Pyramid has a history of advertising their products at ""peak"" power instead of RMS (or continuous) power. What is peak power? In the DJ world, we referred to it as ""WLS"" power - When Lightning Strikes. So, why use peak power when everyone else uses RMS power? Because your product is so weak and of such poor quality that the only way you can sell your product is to oversell its abilities. Buy Pyramid at your own risk."
2,"Great product, lousy price!","This spray has a fantastic fragrance, you can pick this up at any Walmart for under $2.00 and not have to wait for it to be shipped. Great to have in your car, gym bag or purse."
4,NO FOOLING - A FUN BOOK,"Kids love to visit their grandparents, and grandparents love to have them (most of the time). A visit may hold many surprises when it begins on April Fool's Day, which is what happened when two rambunctious youngsters arrived at the farm.Told in lilting rhyme and illustrated in bold full-page color ""April Foolishness"" is a merry look at that special day. Grandma begins the day as grandpa is cooking breakfast in the kitchen. She thinks, ""Life on the farm keeps a gal on her toes. That's what grandma thought as she flung on her clothes.""Well grandpa needs to be on his toes, too because the first thing he hears from his young visitors is that the cows have gotten loose and one stepped on a goose. Next is the announcement that the chickens are out, and the pigs broke the gate.Children will smile their way through this rollicking story until they learn who pulls off the best April Fool joke of all.- Gail Cooke"
1,Bushnell Image View 8X30 Roof Prism Binocular,"I purchased this item approximately a month and a half ago. Upon receiving it I discovered that the item was very hard to program, next to impossible, would not link to my computer for downloads of picture etc. I sent the item back to the sender requesting a refund of my purchase price and they sent me another new 8x30 binocular. I haven't even opened this one. I am sending it back again with another note to refund my purchase price.Bushnell Image View 8x30 Roof Prism Binocular with 2.1MP Digital Still Camera"
1,batteries were not included,"bought this as a christmas present, but decided to keep it. so just opened it today.will have to review this product later..as the 2 AA batteries were NOT included.one * for that great annoyance."
2,Seems like it would be tough but...,"Disclaimer: My dog is small, but what he does have are a very particular set of skills; skills he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for toys like this.That being said, it's a good enough toy and seems like it would be durable, but the way it was packaged, the plastic mounting plastic put a slight tear in the back of the toy. My dog exploited this slight defect and destroyed the toy within an hour."
1,I MUST BE A TOTAL GEEK,"BOUGHT THIS FAN BECAUSE I NEEDED THE PUSH PIN TYPE, AND IN THE THIRD IMAGE, IT SHOWS THESE, BUT DID NOT COME WITH THESE. CANT EVEN USE THE FAN NOW. PPPPPPFFFF WHAT DO I DO WITH IT NOW? IS A VERY NICE LOOKING FAN AND ID LOVE TO USE IT. SPENT HALF THE DAY TRYING TO REMOVE THE SCREWS AND SPRINGS, BUT COULDNT! TOO BAD THEY DIDNT HAVE A 1-800 # FOR GEEKS LIKE MYSELF, TO CALL BEFORE I ORDERED IT, TO MAKE SURE IT CAME JUST LIKE THE IMAGE SHOWED!"
3,Animals gone to sleep would,"This video was far from being funny, we didn't even find it to be entertaining. It is informative but falls well short of its ""Gone Wild"" title. If given the opportunity again, I would pass on this DVD, its dry."
3,Beatles Memorabilia Price Guide 1997,"I was disappointed with this book due to the fact it needs to be updated from 1997. It only covers Beatles memorabilia, not records or albums. Didn't cover autographs. Only covers pricing for early Beatles items, nothing current or the Beatles as individual artists. If you need a price guide for early items and don't mind the book being outdated by 4 yrs, this is the book for you."
2,not worth it,"This book was recommended to me by a number of people, so I picked up a copy. To be honest, I was a little dissappointed. The descriptions of each compound are short and not all that informative. They reiterate a lot of the standard rhetoric by comparing everything to either LSD or MDMA. Some of the stuff about fentanyl analogues is interesting,..., this book is definately not worth it. Your money would be much better spent on either PiHKAL or TiHKAL by the good Dr. Shulgin (half the references in ""Designer Drugs Directory"" are from these books anyway)."
2,Needs re-edited,"I was disappointed with the organization and usefulness of the information contained within. It was not relevantly up-to-date, in my opinion."
1,Not for Me,Big disappointment. Lots of quickly changing scenes with a NOT relaxing tinny sounding harp music as the sound effect. Views of Serenity was a much better video with better sound effects for relaxation. Don't waste your money unless you really like this harpist's music.
5,Ryo does it again !,Ryo is the most underrated smooth jazz guitar player out there.If you love smoooooth you won't be disappointed with this player. I can't stop listening to the opening tune Gravity. It is so mellow it's ridiculous! lol
3,Another Jane McIntosh coffee table book,"That the author Jane McIntosh has done a number of these mass market books with very good pictures doesn'tmake her place as a scholar less?The teacher of archaeology, ancient history and a dead past needs these visual aidsto get across that what once was a going business or civilization has past, has ruins and bodies and tools left to show thatthey were alive and very active.Maps and pictures left on rocks help us see that their world views were very different.Shakespeare's play ""Titus Andronicus"" shows us a very different view ofthe Roman Empire than what we usually get from books like this.That is why written history is better even if incompletethan digging in the earth for residues."
2,Worse than the 1GHz comcast installed.,I replaced the 1GHz splitter installed by Comcast with this one and i see more pixalation then i did before. Disappointed.
1,Very shiny,"I am staring at a US Govt bid document. I can't believe they are wasting our tax dollars on this shiny object. Cable and over-the-air TV signals only go up to 1GHz, so the rest of the 2GHz bandwidth just lets in the interferors eg. cell phones, microwave ovens etc which actually mess with the TV signal. It's true there can be extra loss in the different ways a signal can be split, but it really is unnoticeable. It's more important to minimize the number of connections, cable length and use good cable and connectors in your setup. However the 24K gold does look great and if I had to have a splitter exposed to view, this one would surely impress my friends and neighbors, just like my other gold connectors, Bose speakers and monster speaker cable. That might be worth the extra $20."
5,Excellent Product,"I choose this rating because of The Company. Monster Cable make excellent product and are high grade product. The Item works great. I needed It for hooking up a 2 TVs, computer , and the internet."
1,Shiny Junk,"I really don't get it how monster just gets away pricing their junk like this. I got this months ago to fix some loss issues. Saw this shiny think with overpriced tag, and thought it will resolve the issue. After using this the HD was creating problems, TVs in my other rooms were having huge issues with signal. Finally went back to comcast's splitter and all was well. They recommended not to use this. I totally agree. Nice gold plating though. Can be in a display cabinet. Not just this monster product, but so many of their products are simply overpriced when compared to the same quality (in some cases average than normal quality)."
1,Didn't do it for me....,"Typical boys meet girl. Girl blows boys. Boys get off. Girl swallows. Second boy falls in love with girl (presumably due to enthusiastic, quasi-virgin, ""true redhead"" gene pool.) I'm still not clear on the proper etiquette involving the three dimensional, ever-expanding, butt plug accessory.If this cranks your carburetor, then the remaining two stories are sure to fire up your engines. Just be careful of ramming your exhaust pipes.As for me, I prefer to avoid any obsession with the ""pink rosette""."
4,Mercenaries,"First let me say I like Angela Knight's work. I love her Magiverse series and I loved ""Jane's Warlord"". I think I was expecting ""Mercenaries"" to be more like ""Jane's Warlord"", so I was a little disappointed with ""Mercenaries"". If you don't mind a little bondage here and a little menage-a-tois there, then knock yourself out. But, if you're like me and don't really find that to be your cup of tea, then be forewarned."
5,This is excellant works,True to her talents Angela has out done herself once again with three short stories about her Mercenaries. That all center around one ships crew. A must have.
2,plastic tray,"I was expecting a ceramic tray after reading the other review posted. I should have guessed from the price, but it's just a cheap plastic tray. I'm sure aesthetics aside it works perfectly... but is that what the art of bonsai is about?"
3,A no frills plastic tray,"Fits the Bonsai, could be a little deeper. No frills solution to spill over and humidity."
2,"Less Beef, Needs More Substance",This DVD is just a malicious attack on 50 Cent. Its a sad state of affairs when a rapper has to beef to sell records. The Game needs to concentrate more on his music than worrying about 50 Cent. The DVD has some entertainment value but overall its kinda embarrasing for The Game to have to stoop to this level to destroy the character of 50 Cent. The rappers are beefing but Jimmy Iovine (distributor of 50 Cent & Game CD's) is laughing and getting all the money.
3,the game,"firts its not the seriuos its kinda funny .dont think u gonna see 50 talkin to the cops they have a fake 50 das funny.dont think u gonna see buck gettin his chain robbeddont think oliver its gonna show his/her bickits just the game talkin.the only thing he can prove wit this dvd its da PRODIGY of mobb deep its really fake he is not who he says he is when he rappin,he is on da dvd sayin my migga game what up don, sayin lots of good things about game ,next week sing to 50 and he wont talk to game cuz he is wit 50. what a friend!DONT BUY THEIR NEW ALBUM THEY FAKE.50 didnt get shot 9 times he got shot about 3 times police record says .not the game"
1,Not Rich Still lying,"IF U WANNA SEE SOME GUY GONE CRAZY BECAUSE OF BEING AN LOSER, GAME IS PERFECT EXAMPLE.SOME PEOPLE CALL HIM CRAZY,SOME CALL HIM FAKE,SOME CALL HIM 50 WANNA BE, BUT I LOVE TO CALL HIM LOSER.YES A PERFECT LOSER.THIS GUY IS BIGGEST LIAR EVER.50 SAID IT :NEWS FLASH NOBODY BEILIEVES YOU!HIS BROTHERS HATE HIM,HIS MOMMA HATE HIM,50 HATE HIM AND WHOLE G UNIT SOLDIERS HATE HIM.GAME WAS NOT A GANGSTA HE WAS AN IDIOTIC STRIPPER IN SOME BAR OR A GUARD .HE WAS NOT A GANGSTA . IF HE THINKS HE IS GANGSTA WHY DIDN'T HE MEET 50 FACE TO FACE WHEN G UNIT SHOT HIS HOMIE.HE IS BLACK VANILLA ICE END OF STORY."
3,Love Story To 50 Cent,"Maybe I didnt read enough of the reviews before I purchased DVD, but it's definitely a love-hate story directed towards 50 Cent and the G-Unit clique. For someone who hates the group, he sure did spend a sufficient amount of time and money dissing them and going to NY to 'find him.' From a 'mature' standpoint, it seemed like a waste of time to me. From a comedy stand point, it was kinda funny. I'm not a big fan of 50, but damn, if I didnt like someone, Id considered them 'dead.' I wouldnt make a documentary aimed at them. Shrugs."
1,don't waste your money,"i wish i had never bought it. i stopped it after 15 min. i'm a fan of hip-hop/rap and i thought i was gonna see some real things. I completely lost respect for Game. Man, game is a clown: he is under the same label as 50, he works with the same producers, and he claims he has to travel tru all the states to find 50? yeah right! if he really wanted to see him, he would just have waited for him at Dre's studio. He tries to look bad going to Queens and then to CT in 50's house to play basketball. Of course, he goes there when 50 is touring in Europe......really lame. 50 and G-Unit kicked you out....get over it."
1,GAME OVER,"Game is helpless. He doesn't know what to do anymore, G-Unit is haunting him. Nothing is working for him. He knows 50&Dre made him, he can't succeed on his own. He has problems with his brother, his crew, his label. He's the fakest rapper that has ever been seen since vanilla ice. If you think otherwise, do your homework, you don't know half of it. And by the way, if you want to compare albums, it's a debut vs. a debut, so compare The Documentary (3-4 mil sold) to Get Rich or Die Tryin' (11 mil sold) not the Massacre..... NOW tell me who's hot. And then, when Game's second album comes out compare it to Massacre, you'll see, you won't hear Game's name ever again. Thus, GAME OVER. G-Unit is the past, present and future."
1,WHAT AN IDIOT!!!!!!,"THIS FOOL IS TRESPASSING ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, DEFACING PUBLIC PROPERTY FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE??????HE PROBABLY DOES NOT REALIZE HE'S COMMITTED SEVERAL CRIMES ON TAPE!!!!!!IF YOU BUY IT TAKE IT TO YOUR NEAREST POLICE DEPT AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT."
3,Kobolds get some culture,"The highlight in this work is the nice elaboration of kobold culture. It helps show why the scaly, little munchkins are so interesting.The rest of the book is fairly lackluster."
5,very good,"It fit my powershot S45 perfectly as advertised.A short note: Try not to purchase a used one, every usage eats the lifetime, whether careful or not..."
5,As good as it goes,"This battery is exactly the same as the one I got with my Canon S30 package, same performance. That's all one cares!"
4,A battery in Need,I bought this battery to go with my Canon S30. I was advised by friends that my camera would need a backup battery. So I spent the money.That has been money well spent. The battery can be recharged at any stage of discharge or use. It charges quickly. This has meant that it is charged before the one I am using needs to be charged. This was a very wise purchase and I would recommend it to others planning on using a digital camera.CARRY a BACKUP BATTERY.I gave it 4 stars because I would like the charge to last a little longer.
4,Excellent Custormer Service,"I purchased 2 batteries to test my camera since it stopped working and I thought it was a battery matter. It turned out that it was my camera problem not a battery so I asked a return with full refund. There was no trouble for that and it was easy and quick.One thing, the battery package was different from the picture and it supposed to be even more powerful one. Nevertheless, it didn't look like regular factory product but I guess quality didn't have any difference?!"
3,Overpriced for their capacity/performance,"I use 2 NB-2Ls with my Canon S30. Recently, neither one will hold their charge - I get 30 shots at best (using the LCD and occasional flash). As mentioned by another reviewer, I think the problem was using them in the cold."
1,Rip off!,This item is marketed as a Canon brand battery. It is not a Canon brand battery. It also does not work in the Canon battery charger. It is completely useless and a waste of money. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
3,Buy an aftermarket battery,"The Canon NB-2L is an OK battery, however, you can do much better by purchasing an aftermarket product. Specifically, Sterlingtek makes a replacement with a rating of 1100mah which is almost double that of the Canon's. The price on the Sterlingtek is only $19.99 (shipping is $6.99 but is free for orders over $60). The price difference is more than just a ""few bucks"" as another review claimed. Their web site is www.sterlingtek.com"
3,Battery Life is limited,Size is nice and small. Lithium battery have no memory so you can charge it anytime. Biggest problem is the battery life. You need to buy an extra 1 or 2 so you can keep taking pictures at an event.
1,Leftist Trash,"I've been a police officer for three decades and can tell you that ANYONE suggesting that blacks don't commit a vastly disproportionate amount of violent crime and inter-racial crime, is a lying, agenda-driven Leftist. This book is purposeful disinformation, aimed at confusing the ill-informed masses. But, don't believe me. The FBI ""Uniform Crime Reports"" (UCR) are published annually and can be downloaded for free from the FBI website. The crime data is what it is, and it clearly illustrates what liberals would rather you didn't know."
4,Honor thy Father.How can you when he's evil?,"In the hands of a less talented or mature director this movie would have come across as exploitation. In the hands of Tim Roth,""The War Zone"",is an unflinching,realistic portrait of child molestation that never strays into the area of tittilation. It's probably too realistic and dark for mainstream viewers,but i still feel it's an important creation that sheds light on an destructive sexual deviancy. The main character,Fred Cunliffe,gives a terrific performance as the moral center of the story who is just starting puberty. His sister,played by Lara Belmont,is stunning as the tortured soul.She exhibits the perfect blend of courage,fatalism,inner beauty,and hope. The conflict that she feels between loyalty to her father and what she knows is right is displayed with a maturity beyond her years. I recommend this hidden gem,but with reservations."
3,"Great movie, terrible DVD transfer",A film this great should have had better treatment than this. The movie was over compressed. All you see is artifacts and an unstable picture. The DVD is only 4.33 GB which includes all the special features. The VHS version actually looks better. The movie gets 5 stars but the DVD quality gets a 1.
2,The Bore Zone,"What really disappointed me was that there were no subtitles. Oh I speak english, it's just I couldn't understand what the hell these people were saying. They talk in this low grade incoherent British babble. Now for the movie. Its got some real shock value and the acting is good. Ray Winstone is great, even though I only understand about 30% of what he says. The actress who plays the incest victim is an incredible actress. She is also really hot, you almost can't blame the father(I'm going to hell for that one). The guy who plays her brother doesn't really do much but stand around with the same dumb stoned look on his face. You call that good acting? I spend most of my time doing that. The mother is also very good."
2,are we all talking about the same movie?,"i'm really sorry to go against the grain of the the other reviews here, but i feel an obligation to give a different perspective. i personally felt sorry for anyone involved in the making of this movie, especially the actors because the acting was soooo good. it's just sad to see such talent wasted on such a badly put together movie. besides the occasional discussions of incest, which were oddly void of emotion, there was absolutely nothing interesting or developing in the plot. There are long periods of painful nothingness, and the unrealistic and random stabbing of the father towards the end of the movie made me burst out laughing.i'm sorry if i'm not as ""deep"" as the rest of reviewers because obviously i did not analyze this long, boring, badly scripted movie, as hard as they did. good luck"
1,"Not incest or relationship, just plain abuse","I agree with much of what has been written, but somehow fail to understand how anyone could have thought that there was a supposed ""relationship"" between the teenage daughter and the filthy father. One only needs to look at the scene where the girl is desperately crying in the martello tower to see that she is in all effects being ""raped"" by her father.His loathsome and disgusting nature is cemented with the scene regarding the baby (!!) Unfortunately this ""is"" reality, and am sad to agree with a reviewer's comments that this is a ""terrible truth"" -Although I do admire Tilda Swinton and am far (very far) from being prude or narrow minded, I am left wondering whether films like this actually fuel grotesque and depraved behaviour in certain minds-"
2,"More tea, vicar?","Tim Roth chaired an open forum to answer questions about this film on release. When he heard an opinion he objected to, he invited the opinionator to step outside. Phew! What a commitment to free speech. Mr Orange isn't just for Hollywood, he's for life!This film is shot in widescreen so we can get the full panorama of misery. After a charming scene of buggery, Mr Roth pauses to set up a nicely framed bit of arthouse aesthetica with daughter in the middle and dad to one side in halo's of light. Aw, bless. What worries me about War Zone's pre-publicity is that all the sleazo's out there will fast forward to find the bunk up in the bunker for a quick dodgy Barclays. Between you, me and the edge of a cliff, I leave it up to your imagination as to what should be done to pond life who do that. ""So give us your review of the rest of the film, Gaz!"" Ooer, is that the time?......."
3,Book vs. movie,"I watched the movie and read the book. To be fair, I would not have read the book had I not first seen the movie on the Independent Film Channel. As with many films, it loosely follows the novel. As the author, Alexander Stuart, wrote the screenplay as well, I would assume that he was OK with the changes that were made. I think both stories are good in their own right, but I wish that the movie had been more true to the original characters and plotline. For those that found the movie interesting, I would suggest reading the actual book, it they have not already done so."
4,Quick and easy,Purchase was easy and delivery was within expected timeframe. Appreciate the opportunity to purchase new or like-new books at competitive prices.
3,"Should be titled ""Does your child have an eating disorder""","I purchased this book hoping to get some information about how I can help my daughter with her eating disorder. About a third of the book is exercises to determine IF your child might have an eating disorder (and much of this is listing myths). Then it skips right into comparing different types of treatment. I found nothing in this book about how I could help my daughter after her diagnosis and between doctor/psychologist visits. I felt like I was reading a college textbook on Eating Disorders 101. As a parent of a child afflicted with anorexia, I did not find this book helpful. Perhaps it would be useful for someone who suspects his or her child has an eating disorder and wants more information."
3,Packaging Terrible,I received this couch and thought there was no way it could be in the box it was shipped in. When I took it out it was rolled all up and shoved into a box. It came with a note that said it was to save on shipping and that the wrinkles would come out and the foam would pop back up. Well it has been a week and it still has wrinkles and the foam is still not totally back to normal. The couch seems like it is good but the packaging was terrible.
1,"Fun Furnishings Sofa Sleeper, Pink Micro Suede","Well unfortunately, I paid for something that I was not especting this Sofa Sleeper is for baby noy even for a toddler it's very small. Actually it's like a playing sofa sleeper for little girsls room. It does not say the size, they have it adevertise as a real Sofa sleeper. This is the first time that Aazon has dissapointed it me on there merchandise advertisement and the last time I will buy anything."
1,products not up to par,Would NEVER buy from this person and probably Amazon EVER again! The box was in bad condition it came opened and broken. I was unsatisfied with my purchase. I heard about bad things like this happening at Amazon but never thought to be true until now!
4,Quick Review Works,"This book sets out to quickly take us through major events that have shaped the world, organizing the subject into the rule-makers (Solon, Plato, Jesus, Allah etc.) and the rule breakers (basically ever major leader in western civilization). Although the treatment of each topic is very brief, the message is clear and concise: individual ambition is key to understanding world events. Adherence to religious and moral values would have limited the scope of ambition, so these values were routinely twisted or cast aside.This survey piece is ideal for someone who doesn't have the time to read ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" but who does want to understand major events that have gotten us to the present state of affairs. The writing style is lively and easy to follow, and author's footnotes throughout display a good sense of humor. Timely reading for those who are wondering for the first time about Christian-Muslim antagonism or other ethnic conflicts."
3,History for dummies,"3.5 stars.The book is hugely readable and is better understood as a collection of slices of history - some very interesting slices.The author happens to be quite judgemental about people and events - but I quite liked it that way. The irreverent tone and sprinkling of humour make this a very amusing read. This book is probably not for serious student of history, but for those usu. scared of history tomes, I would recommend it unhesitatingly."
4,Armchair Tripping!,"This anthology of true life psychadelic experiences, from LSD and Ecstacy to peyote and ayahuasca, is an entertaining, enlightening trip into the world of mind altering drugs, which probably is too honest and unbiased for the liking of authorities who wish to erase drugs from society. Its candid and honest perspective is a refreshing change from the constant message that drugs are bad and must be obliterated. In Tripping, both euphoric and terrifying experiences are related, as well the use of entheogens, drugs used for spiritual purposes. Tripping neither encourages or discourages drug use, it simply lays the facts out straight. Although every trip differs, there are themes that turn up frequently, such as a higher understanding of self and life, of enlightenment, and sometimes of complete disorientation and panic. I'd highly reccomend Tripping to anyone interested in hallucinogenics and tripping."
3,Good introduction to the subject,"This is an enjoyable little book, very nicely illustrated. (If it matters, the cover illustration is a relief carving of a gladiator poised between two wild beasts--and NOT the elaborate helmet shown above. Perhaps that cover is on a different edition?)The book is aimed at the general reader, rather than the specialist or the hard-core archaeology buff. While it covers the subject well, it doesn't do so exhaustively. Occasionally, one would welcome more detail: for example, instead of cataloguing ALL of the Pompeiian grafitti relating to gladiators, the text discusses only a small sampling of them. Nor is there much discussion of how Pompeii's gladitorial entertainments may have differed from those of other Roman cities of the time.Still, as a basic introduction to the role gladitorial games played in ancient Pompeii, this book has its merits."
1,Do Not Buy,"I could not get mine to work at all. It comes with an astonishingly large and complex instruction manual, one big enough to keep me busy for hours wondering if maybe I didn't do something right."
1,Defective!,"Wow, I wish I had read these reviews first. Mine wouldn't even charge. The red light kept blinking. Nothing ever worked at all. I returned it to Amazon asking for a replacement and instead they refunded my money. After complaining about the error, I realize now after reading the reviews that they did me a huge favor. I wouldn't be surprised if it's their policy now since it seems that these radios just plain do not work. I would give it zero stars but Amazon won't let me."
1,"Boys, I'd duck if I were you.......","I must say that Amazon was good enough to take these unit(s) back, as neither of the two I had sent to me worked as advertised. The first unit had half of the LCD display not working (making it hard to tune), the second one didn't work, period. I suspect our friends in China were having a bad day when that batch went through...., BUT if you think about it very much, the reason you buy a weather radio, at least around here (Texas), is to HEAR the weather alerts when the power's out and a tornado might be on the way towards you...If you're going to place your life on the function of the radio, go upscale and buy a better unit in Amazon's or anyone else's line... I'd give them a thumbs up for trying, but these two were below their usual standards of design, craftsmanship and excellence and reliability.Sincerely,Kyle F. McGrogan"
1,defective,"This was a very disappointing gift to have. The screen was defective, it didn't pick up the weather radio station - so I have returned it.I had spent hours looking through all your options, going to stores, etc, before buying it, so I was really disappointed. No replacement is needed or wanted."
1,Just plain Junk,I am a security guard and bought the item for the multi-use functions. None of the items worked well and I would have been more happy if I had bought a radio tha had been smashed and an attempt was made to fix it with the American Duct Tape.Don't even think of buying this item unless you are rich and want to throw away your money. I have a bridge in Arizona you could buy that would give you better service.
1,De fec tive,"I need to return this product because it has an unreadable LCD- it charged correctly, but the readouts are unreadable."
1,Worthless,"You can crank the dynamo all day long and the most you will get out of this thing is the led flashlight to light up. If you plug it into the wall it will get enough juice to run the radio, but that's it. Once you unplug it from the wall don't expect it to turn it on the next day because it will be dead even if you left it off and hadn't touched it. It either doesn't hold a charge or it sapps a lot of power even when not being used. This is a complete waste of money. I gave mine to my three year old to wear him down at night cranking it to use as a flashlight."
1,Total crap,"This ""radio"" isn't even worth the time it would take to write a bad review. Don't buy it."
1,"no,no,noaa",Very disappointed with this product. I live in an area prone to severe weather so I wanted a radio that would warn me. This radio didn't receive the NOAA channel or the TV audio.
1,Bad Bad Bad !!!!!!!!,Product will not hold a charge. It will lock up when you scan for a station. You can't find replacement batteries. This product sould be taken off the internet.
1,Horse Pill size,"I do not see how anyone can attempt to swallow such huge pills---they make me gag---why would someone produce a size such as this---surely I am not the only elderly person who is unable to swallow pills this size. Guess I will need to find something else for my sight. These are really ridiculous. They do not get my vote at all. I am so glad there are all of you who can swallow these size medicines. I have tried everything but since they are a jel type capsule, they cannot be halved."
4,Ocuvite,My eye doctor recommended that I take ocuvite twice a day. The product serves this requirement and has been handy and reasonbly priced.
1,Just no good,"A friend from work bought a pair of these and found they were ""incompatible"" with his board. I snagged them up for $20, pleased with myself for finding such a good deal. HA!One is straight up no good, won't POST. Fails in every memory slot>The other gets me through the BIOS but fails under load. Can't get through installing Windows without page faults, memory dumps, or other general failures. An alternate stick proves it's the memory and not the system. NOT advised."
2,Only for non-overclockers on a budget,"I concur with Nima, this RAM is terrible for overclocking. Any attempt to do so, even very little, resulted in fatal system crashes, and the memory diagnostics tool in Vista always said hardware failure, until the FSB was brought to default again (I have a P5E-VM HDMI board with the E8400 Wolfdale processor). I haven't had other problems with it but I've only been using it for a week. It's not worth the approximately $25 (after rebates of course), even if you're looking for cheap RAM. Corsair needs to stop using crap ingredients in their hardware. My next RAM will be made by another company."
2,WENT BAD IN LESS THAN A YEAR !!,I bought this ram from AMAZON because I had always had good luck with their products in the past. Not this time !! One of the ram chips has already gave out in less than a year. I purchased in March of 2011. Ram gave out in January of 2012.Needless to say I will have to give a lot of thought as to if I will buy another product of this type from AMAZON ever again. My advice is do not buy this product !!! Well at least one ram chip is still good!!
2,Does not work with my Zotac ITX,"I bought this to make an HTPC from a Zotac Ion motherboard/computer. It would bluescreen after a few minutes. I played with using one stick, changed the order, loaded several versions of operating system from Windows 7 to Vista to XP 32 bit and 64. It would operate LONGER in safe mode, but still would BSOD (blue screen)Swapped with some older Corsair 1G sticks and works fine. It might be just a compatability. They are working fine in an Asus motherboard but I never was succesful using the 4 Gigs in the Zotac."
1,Wrong Delivery PC5400 Memory,See Title. Wish i did get the right memory but im using it now.Not a big deal it works. but its simple a wrong delivery
1,Bad Stick,"One of the two sticks was bad (would not boot)I'm not willing to chase this; once bitten, twice shyI'll try another source."
4,"Affordable, quality RAM.","Purchased the 2GB dual channel kit to get a new gaming computer off the ground, while saving up for higher quality/quantity sticks and a new video card. These have been rock-stable, and can take a small bit of overclock (less than 20%). Access times and data transfer speeds are nothing to write home about, but then again, I picked these up for $25 (currently $30 at the time of writing.)If one is looking to set up a low cost build it yourself system, or looking to bump up the memory in an older system, I would definitely recommend these modules.Detected correctly on old DFI board, though only at half frequency (1:1). A quick change to 1:2 in the BIOS remedies that."
3,Beware what revision you get for OC,"This ram comes in flavors from revision 1 to I believe revision 6 (the latest revision I heard about..). I believe after revision 3 or 4 they started using Promo or other crappy memory chips instead of the really good Micron chips. The cheaper ram chips run OK most of the time but the real draw back is that they have shorter life and most importantly DO NOT overclock well at all. So, unless you know you are getting an early revision of these sticks, don't bother. If you really want a memory from Corsair that just runs at stock speeds, then you are better off with the slightly more expensive CL4 versions anyway since they are so much faster."
1,Not as represented,Item was described as having a latency of 5-5-5-12. What I received had a latency of 5-5-5-18-2T and was not compatible with the modules I had in my PC.
2,Careful.,When i received these they came in two different versions. dead and fried. I'm sure there fine when they work but after spending a month replacing motherboards and processors find out these guys were the problem and by the time i find out it's too late to take em back. so not super happy.
1,One memory stops working,"THE memory was working well (apparently), but at any moment the PC froze and one of the two ceased to function. My Main Board, an XFX Geforce 8200 throw the D5 POST message."
5,CORSAIR 4Gb 800MHZ,"Cordiales Greetings; After acquiring CORSAIR memories, I can say that I have no adverse comment, the others say that this product is one of the best in its category. I recommend it to a 64 bit operating systems and applications that require large amounts of RAM as design software and computer-aided 3D applications. I am waiting for dismissal This will be useful commentary..."
1,FRIED MY SYSTEM!!!,"I bought this product from amazon and first of all it didn't ship for over a month causing a delay on a big project, and once I got the ram it fried my board. NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON DIRECTLY!!!! I'm contemplating suing for damages!"
1,I DO NOT ARRIVE THE PRODUCT,GOOD MORNING MRS AMAZON; A PROCESADOR REALISES A PURCHASE OF TWO PRODUCTS AND MEMORIAS AND I ONLY ARRIVE THE PROCESSOR I HOPE TO HAVE ANSWER SINCE IT WAS PAID THANKS
3,"Frugal, Fast, but Flaky","I've RMA'd two sets of 1x2GB over two years. RMA process and shipping has been expedient with no questions asked. I tested the RAM itself, though, and it was bad after only 1 year and then the OEM replacement went bad shortly thereafter. Thus, I am slightly suspect of overall quality of Corsair, but feel somehow it's constrained to the XMS2 line. I've never had to RMA any other manufacturer (e.g. Micron)."
5,Made my computer faster,"I was glad to find this older type of memory for my 6-year old computer. It's a good memory brand, it definitely sped up my computer."
4,reliable,"this was one of my best buys so far, Joe, the seller was awsome, got it in a reasonable time and i think i'll buy again :-)"
2,Not SLI ready memory,Title says it all. Corsair timing is a mystery. If you can find the advanced timing settings on their website please post them because I gave up after an hour of looking.
5,great cheap memory,Memory works perfect. It's an offbrand but I haven't had any issues with it since installation.
2,2 of 4 bad sticks,"Of the two packages I ordered (four sticks, total), there was a bad stick in each that did not pass Memtest even through Test 4. The ones that did work were only stable at CL5 timings. I'm currently going through the Amazon return policy to get them replaced.System configuration was an Asus P5K-C, timings were 800MHz DDR2, CL5-5-5."
1,Caused constant reboots,"After installing, this RAM caused constant reboots on my machine. Corsair is usually great RAM, so I chalk this up to a bad batch."
5,Really good but expensive,Very nice product and very fast but by the time I bought it was really expensive (180 US$) maybe now it's at a good price. I'm satisfied after all.
5,*** Excelente relación precio valor ***,Dimm de excelente rendimiento a un excelente precio... Lo estoy utilizando en un servidor de nivel medio con rendimiento muy aceptable... Ampliamente recomendado este producto.
1,1 of 2 Chips Was Dead-On-Arrival,"Buying this RAM cost me an hour of my life... that I'll sadly never get back.One of the two 1GB sticks was shot (my PC failed to boot with it installed). Clearly Corsair isn't big on quality control. It took me a bit to isolate which chip was bad, then I noticed the remaining chip appeared to be running at 667MHz not 800MHz. I really didn't get into trouble-shooting this as, given the DOA chip; I knew they were both going back.NOTE: To the reviewer who suggested bad Corsair chips were due styrofoam peanut packaging ... mine were shipped out peanut free with no other likely source of static. I'm also extremely careful about ESD and wear a strap every time I open up a PC. I'm convinced this thing really was DOA. And, it's not like I'm the only one here... a good number of the reviews talk about these chips showing up dead.I should have saved myself the hassle and paid (literally) $6 more for better memory (which I've now done, Dell part #A0821575)."
5,Works fine.,"Vista x64 on a Dell XPS 420, went from 4gb to 8gb of this ram. Intalled w/o a hitch and working fine for 2 months. Not a significant improvement in responsivness, but the price with rebate was too good to pass up. It's also fun to say you have 8gb of ram."
4,Works with ASRock 4CoreDual-SATA2 R2,"Got it from amazon, insert it into my ASRock Mobo, boots right up. No issues found. According to the manual, my Mobo can address 2GB of RAM, I put these RAMs in, the system found 4GB but only can use 3GB, strange but happy. By the way, my BIOS is v2.0, these RAMs won't work with v2.1."
3,Great Customer Service,"Bought a pair of corsair PC-6400 modules. One module was DOA. Corsair Customer Service was great and processed an RMA in no time. Good Product, Great Customer service."
3,Corsair CM2X1024-6400 (50:50),"This memory gives fair performance, however one of the sticks I received does not fucntion at all - a sign of poor quality testing. Beware of this, unless you are happy to ship returns back and forth until you have a good set."
5,Works Great!,Easy to install and has really helped my computer run faster! Make sure you read your motherboard's manual to learn how to get the Dual-Channel to work correctly.
1,Bad sticks galore,"I would be vary wary of this RAM, I bought from Amazon and had 2 bad sticks, bought from Newegg and had 2 bad sticks, finally had 2 good sticks sent to me on the second try from newegg, and ordered again from tiger direct through amazon and had sucess. I would say it is about 50-50 on getting working RAM with these, and when you finally do it will have taken you about a month."
1,just didn't work,"Tried to expand memory with the same memory that came with my computer to maximize compatibility,Had a set that didn't work, then sent those back. Got a replacement which blew out one of the memory slots.All around a bad experience."
5,The definitive Best of the Best!,"This book is on my mandatory reading lists for my students from 5th kyu through yudansha. I find it the best book on explaining the ""why"" Sensei do what they do, think like they think, and teach like they teach. It also refocuses sensei to ""remember"" what it is that they are doing. This book gives insight and understanding to every martial arts practitioner on the way that it ""should be"" and is in traditional karate training. I applaud Mr. Klein and hope to see other books by him. Buy it."
5,Great Replacement Fit for HP Notebooks,This company has low cost batteries that work as good or better than the original HP company...I highly recommend.
1,Samsun HLT-5675S 1080p DLP HD TV,"This tv is a piece of junk. Is the same sad story ""if I knew then what I know now"" I'd never of bought this. All these problems are well documented and Samsing is aware are of them but they do nothing to correct it. Customer service is very very poor and supposed tech reprenentives do not no more than the man from Shinola. TV keeps shutting of by itself. When on half the time there is no pictures or sound. Overheats as the cooliong fan is worth about a nickel and makes loud funny noises. Save your moeny and get a Toshiba."
5,Perfect TV for the $$$,"I bought this TV (my first HDTV)a few months ago and have been nothing but pleased. It was about 40% cheaper than what I would have paid for it in the store, it arrived swiftly from Amazon and in perfect condition. I was easily able to set up Sony surround sound and my xbox 360. The picture quality is amazing in HD, not as great when viewing regular cable, but that's to be expected. Have yet to have any problems. A great deal!"
5,Outstanding,"TV has the best possible picture in HD and I can tell no difference from 1080p. I got a stand from Wal-Mart that fits the TV perfectly. It's 40"" corner stand with a piano black top and bottom with one glass shelve in between. The base of the TV is almost exactly 40"" and it looks like it's made for this television. It cost only $90.00. This TV is a pleasure to watch and taking advantage of all the new DirectTV HD channels makes a perfect match. The only disappointment was shipping. It took 16 days, over a week past the due date and the shipper never called me. I had to track down the TV myself. They also missed the first delivery date of Friday, but did deliver it on Saturday. Overall I am beyond pleased with this purchase."
5,great value for the money,Wanted to upgrade the old TV in our den and purchased this Samsung. Great picture. For the price you can't beat it.
5,Good buy,"This is a good television for the price. It has a great picture in HD. And it is not to deep, 14 inches, I believe. I bought the matching stand (TR-500X3B) and visually they look terrific together. There are a couple of things I don't like about the tv also. One is, when it is on and there is a dark picture showing, there is a circle that appears in the middle of the screen, the owners manual says it is normal, but I don't like it. Another thing that I don't like is when the tv is on, it has a high pitched ringing sound, it is not noticeable when the sound is on, but I am kinda picky. Other than that there isn't much to complain about. Oh and when I watch movies on blu-ray, I can't tell a difference from a 1080p television. So picture quality is great. I paid $999.99 for this television with free shipping and no tax. That is why I give this television 5 stars."
4,A Visiter to Marrakech,"I read this book while living with my family for 6 months in Morocco. I found that the book portrayed the same problems and frustrations that both me and my family were experiencing, as well as some of the wonder. Included are some wonderful descriptions and insights as to Moroccan/American differences and the way Americans are percieved by the rest of the world. I thought it deeply desplayed Moroccan culture and customs as well as one of the most interesting cities in the world."
1,Just don't buy it,"I should have listened to the other negative reviews on this product. Bought it and finally have to return it. It's really what the others have said. I ended up buying a Samsonite at Best Buy for my Canon S30. If your camera is also as small as mine, that Samsonite is probably the best you can find out there."
2,Not really a good case,"Othr than the Canon brandname, the case is not a good one: (i) not enough protection, (ii) doesn't cover the whole camera, (iii) no room even for a single accessory (such as extra memory, let alone an extra batter). It's not worth it given that price. Well, if it's 5 bucks, I will have it just for the Canon-brand showoff....Get a Lowepro Z10 instead. BestBuy sells it for $.... It (i) fits my S45 perfectly, (ii) gives a much better protection for the camera, (iii) looks really cool, not bulky at all, (iv) has extra front (extendible) pocket for accessories; (v) has belt strap and shoulder strap. Finally, it's waterproof."
4,Good compact case for a compact camera,"This is a good case for casual camera users who don't want a big, bulky case. Its small size holds only the camera itself so you can easily slip the case/camera into a coat pocket, fanny pack, or backpack. (There is also a belt loop.) The two drawbacks are that the case is expensive, and it does not completely cover the camera (see picture). The padding is sufficient, but if you happen to drop the camera just right, it might still get damaged even though it's in the case. This case is not for you if you want something that will store extra memory cards and spare batteries. But if you want a streamlined case designed specifically to fit a Powershot S45 and similar Canon cameras, you should consider this one."
2,A standard case that doesn't add much,"This case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses, briefcases or luggage. But don't count on it to protect your camera from falls, dirt or dust.It looks good, the PowerShot logo gives an authentic look to it."
5,Book review,"This book is for the person who wants to scientifically understand how weight (loss and gain) works. It's not just ""look at me, I lost 50 lbs in a month"". No, it has real stories but ALL the scientific data to back it up. I HIGHLY recommend this book. Mine is highlighted and dogeared!"
3,great tips,There were some good tips mixed with success stories. The info was detailed and made for a good read. End
4,A book as practical as Weight Watchers Itself!,"This book provides solid, practical information that helps readers put weight loss 'wives tales' to rest and understand the true science behind lasting weight loss. If you're finally ready to accept that you must make lifestyle changes, a little at a time, and be consistent with your food choice improvements, then it's time to read this book. It will help you keep the commitment to yourself to keep excess weight off."
3,good info but boring,"The book has a lot of good info but most of us know all of it already so I found it to be not useful and boring. However, if you are new to dieting and weight loss than it would be good for you."
5,Excellent Book,"A Excellent Book witht a lot of examples and mathematical models that will help to found the correct way to implant a dot com business, Every IT must read it"
4,The Egypt Game,"The Egypt Game is a fascinating book.The story is about April who is very clever and outgoing.Melanie who is very protective over her younger brother Marshall and is best friends with April.Marshall is four years old and has a great imagination.Elizabeth is shy but she always knows how to fix a problem.Ken and Toby are best friends and they think they are so funny tough and lastlyis the Professor which is very shy but later he is very nice and becomes friends with the kids.The story takes place in California in a little town and April has just moved into the Casa Rosada.She later becomes friends with Melanie and Marshall and they find out about a yard that has been abandoned.Later,Elizabeth moves into the Casa Rosada and she also joins the fun of going to the yard.And it eventually turns into the Egypt Game."
3,The Egypt Game,A mysterious game soon turns scary after 6 kidspretending to be Egyptians find out there was amurderer lurking around. Will they find him in time?The book started out boring but it got better towards the end.I wouldn't recommend this book. It doesn't say much about Egypt.
4,The game of mystery,I didn't like the first few chapters but after a while I got in to this book and then I couldn't put it down. This is a great book for anyone at any age. My favorite part was on Halloween. I can't tell you what happened then I would ruin the story. By the the ending is the best part so I wouldn't change a thing about it.
1,The Egypt Game,"I hated this book because it was just so boring! Some parts in this book were interesting. The only reason I read this book is because I had to. I would never recommend this book to anyone. On a scale of 1-10, this book would earn an one. I had a very hard time keeping my interest in this book. This book is a horrible book!"
1,The Egypt Game,"I didn't really like the book. There was only one exciting part in the book, and it was at the end. If you want to learn about Egypt, this book is not for you. It only has the names of a couple gods, not that much on Anicent Egypt. I did like the author. Look for more of her books because, the author is very descriptive. I wouldn't reccomend this book, only because the book is boring."
2,mention of child murder - not for the sensitive kid....,"My mature but sensitive 8 year old daughter found the book fairly good until the mention of a child's disappearance and murder. While the incident is not central to the story, it was disturbing enough that my daughter wants nothing more to do with the book...."
1,The Egypt Game,"I don&#65533;t recommend this book to anyone! This is by far the worst book I&#65533;ve ever read! the title is very deceiving. When I saw the book I thought well the title sounds interesting. My teacher said it was a book about a mystery,there is no mystery what so ever. There are character april, Melanie, marshal, and to boys. the only suspenseful part is where one of the girls almost gets killed. The book gets better for a chapter and the it gets lamer and lamer. This is mostly a book for girls and in my group the girls didn&#65533;t like it! I don&#65533;t recommend this book! Save your time and your money"
2,What I thought,I thought the book lacked some excitement.I liked somethings about it like the suspense.The characters were pretty cool like the professor and security.Ithought over all it was a pretty good book in parts.Other parts were pretty bad though.
1,Boring....Too many adjectives,"Our teacher told us to read this book to answer questions. This book is dull and uses too many adjectives at the same time. Every question is like: explain, describe, explain, describe, describe. If like 90% of the words are adjectives, how could you even write a book. I think the author was too confused.I would rate this book 0 stars if possible. How could there be a mental idiot in that such small town? The chances are like 0.333%. I think it's also too weird (Girls dont fit well with Boys, especially at the same where, who, what, when, why)."
2,Not very interesting,"I was looking forward to reading this Newbery winner, but was disappointed. I didn't find the Egyptian parts very interesting at all."
2,"The Egypt Game........Good, but not very well written","To put everything in a nutshell, I don't believe this book would be your best buy. I does however promote imagination, and gives some good ideas for people who love Egypt. But there are some problems to it.- not very well written- descriptions are lacking- does not have a clear story lineLastly, I must add that in a strictly Christian perspective, the rituals, cermonies, and gods seemed to grate on my nerves. These kids shouldn't have gotten so caught up in heaten practices. When I first read it, I quit because I wasn't sure ifit would be ageanst my bliefs. Nevertheless, I will say that it can be worth the read, but I would recommend checking it out at the Library before you buy. I ABSOLUTELY think if you LOVE it though, you should buy it for Amazon.com only. For a classroom though, it might incourage heathen practices and rituals that your morals might disapprove of."
4,Brittany P. from Dryden Book Club,"Hi, I am a girl and I am in the Dryden Book Club. We meet every two weeks and this week we are reading The Egypt Game. I have just started the first two chapters. My favorite thing about this book is that it's ancient. Our Book Club meets again on Thursday the 24th."
5,A book that touchs your heart and keep you on the edge.,"We, the 7th graders at Saluda School, have just finished reading this exciting, blood-pumping novel. This book was so exiting, we could hardly put it down. In fact, we didn't even want to go to our next class. Please take our word for it, and read this book. You won't regret it."
5,"Egyptians, Hieroglyphics, Ancient Egypt.","They call themselves the Egypt gang. They have their own meeting place. They worship gods. They have their own hierolyphics, etc. Marshall, Toby, Ken, Melanie, Elizabeth, and April are all part of it. They have so much fun until something happens. Read and find out. Good for people who like ancient history. Great book for everyone!"
2,The Egypt Game,"The Egypt Game is an exciting book. In the beginning of the story is boring. After you read on it gets better. The story has six main characters, April, Melanie, Marshall, Toby, and Ken. April is Friends with Melanie. Melanie has a brother named Marshall. Toby and Ken join later in the game. They're like any other boys, but at times they're a real handful. Ken always says,""Sheesh"", Marshall always takes an octopus with were ever he goes, and April also moved to live with her grandmother Caroline. There's also a Professor who has a store called: A-Z Antiques Curious Used Merchandise, but no one knows what A-Z means so is it a real mystery after all? solve the puzzle by reading TheEgypt Game!"
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"The Egypt Game is about six kids who live in an apartment in California. There's April, Melanie, Elizabeth, Marshall, Ken, and Toby. The apartment is called the Casa Rosada. They play a game called The Egypt Game.There is a professor who stalks them, but they don't know it. They are suspicious about him. They play in a shed in the Professor's storage yard. They do rituals and stuff like that.I would not recommend this book. It was okay, but I wasn't impressed. I do not really like the Egyptian theme."
2,The Egypt Game,"To put it in words, I did not enjoy this book. The characters were original, the scenes were clever, but the storyline is not enjoyable. Snyder did an amazing job to make the book sound better than it looked. Though overall, it comes down to the kids in 1967 may have liked this book. The unusual events that happened in the book is my theory why they chose this book as a Newberry Award winner. If you really enjoy ancient history or Egypt, then this book may be for you. Otherwise I would not suggest it to kids, adults may appreciate this book."
3,My Review,"This book isn't a book I would perfer to read again, because at the begining it is really boring and finally at the end of the book it gets good. It's about a girl named April who moves to California and meets Melanie and Marshall. They go to an old lot and make a place they call Egypt. They meet two mew members, Ken and Toby, and let them join. They get to keep the yard afther a accident and they continue the game of Egypt would have changed the begining so it would be more excited."
5,Wonderful and unique story.,"... I must admit though when I first heard of it I thought it was going to be a fiction book, but clearly it wasnt't. I do also think the first chapter is sort of boring but trust me it gets better.The story is about this small group of kids, all very different,with one thing in common. They all like Egyptian things. So they form the Egypt Game. They have to play in the back of and old shopkeepers store so their parents don't find out. This means they have to hide the game from the parents and the shopkeeper. Simple, boring plot, right? But author has a unique way of turning this non fictional story into something exciting and interesting. It makes you feel like your right there with the kids playing along. The book is one of those kind that once you start reading you don't want to stop and never want it to end. I would recommend this book to everyone"
4,The Egypt Game,"Melanie and April had just met and were not sure if they would like each other. Soon enough they found out that they both loved thing that had to do with Egypt. One day they find a deserted yard and decided to set that up as the ""land of Egypt."" They hold ceremonies and work out a code every day. soon there were six Egyptians in their secret land. One day member wrote down a question. The next day the answer was on the back! the players wanted to know who was doing that they found out that is was the Profesor, unexpectely. the next day the ""Land of Egypt"" was gone.I think this book was exciting to read. I really liked the part when they couldn't figure out who wrote them a message on the back of thier question. I never thought the Professor was prt of this. I theink the character must have been suprised when he told them that. I liked their idea of the Eygptian land. the ending really surprised me."
5,A fantastic mystery story!,"This book begins with April moving in with Melanie, and they begin to play The Egypt Game in the Professor's back yard. They call the backyard the temple and they have two altars, one to Isis and one to Set. Eventually there are six children involved. It is exciting because you don't know who is the murderer, though the police suspect the professor. So this is a mystery story that is really gripping."
4,One of my childhood favorites,"I came to Amazon looking for this book because I read it in school as a child, and it was one of my favorite books. I have always been fascinated by ancient Egypt, so maybe that explains why I loved it so much. I would read just about anything in elementary school. I remember reading things like Alice in Wonderland and The Hobbit. Both are still favorites of mine. I am looking forward to reading this book again. I hope that they still use this book in the classroom because it really sparked my interest in history."
5,Five star,"The Egypt Game is a thrilling, interesting, fun book to read. I am amazed by how much I liked this book!!!!"
1,The worst book ever,"The book would only interest a third grader at the most because of the word choice. I would give it a 1 out of 100! The book needs more puzzlers, it needs to make you think a lot. The Eye witness book ""Egypt"" is more informative on the subject of Egypt."
3,The Egypt Game,"Melanie Ross didn't think she and April (the new girl) would get along.Actually, they become best friends. They have a lot in common. Like they are both crazy about old Egyptian things,they are in the same class, and live in the same apartment.When they find an empty storage yard behind A-Z shop, owned by the Professor,they get the craziest idea and start the Egypt Game there. After a lot of ceremonies, three more Egyptians join the game. Now there are six Egyptians (Melanie,April,Toby,Marshall (Melanie's brother),Elizabeth,and Ken).A little girl was murdered and the murderer wasn't found. The kids in the neighborhood cannot play outside until the murderer is found. Strange things happen to the Egyptians and they are in trouble,life risk wise.I enjoyed the book a lot."
3,Wonders Of Amazement,Hey have you ever read the Egypt Game its a great book my class is reading it and we are just about finished if you like getting into new books this is for you ger reading!
4,Great book!,I bought this book for my daughter who hated reading. By the 4th chapter she was hooked. My daughter is 12 and this is the first book she has read entirely. She loved the book so much she is now reading The Gypsy Game. This book is a real winner.
4,A good book that had alot of action,When Hollywood girl April and sensible Melanie meet they have almost nothing in common. But a friendship forms because of their love of Egypt. They start playing a game and adventure explodes at them. In time two players become six and keeping the fun a secret becomes a next-to-impossible mission. Alot of fun stuff happens and you should read this book
2,Sielby Richview Middle School,"It starts out with a girl named April who meets a girl named Melaine and her brother Marshall. Then they make up a game calledThe Eggypt Game. And a new girl , Elizabeth joins in . Then a murder happens in the neighborhood which causes them not to be able to go outside and play thier game. So they meet at a house everyday and make Eyptian names and cotumes. When Halloween came insteas of trick-or-treating, they sneek out to go play the game. Two annoying 6th graders caught them. They ended up joining. After that, they created a new alphbet and rituals/cerimonies . Then they tried an oracle . Mysteriously it answered. They found out that one of the 6th graders did it. So at the end all the friends finished the game. I guess the book was o.k. It wasn't all that exciting , but it was o.k. I'd tell a friend thet the book does have lots of imagination."
1,Worst book ever,This book is horrible I had to read it for school and I was always skipping pages trying to find way to get it over with It has no problem the people aren't interesting. If it's the last book trade it with someone else
3,OK,"I rated this book a 3 because I did not like how they used so much amangination in it.Plus, it is a horrible mystery."
2,Surprised to find a murder of a child in a children's book,"Does anyone else think it's completely inappropriate to have a ""little girl"" murdered off in a children's book? And a Newbery winner at that? I'm about halfway through this book (the audio version) with my kids (7 & 8) when we hear about a little girl that's been murdered and her body found in a salt marsh - all before I could get to the pause button on the CD player. Now we have to live with this image. We've been thoroughly enjoying the story until now, but now I'm distrustful about this author's judgement. I think we'll bring it back to the library..."
1,A Pointless Book,"I am a 6th grader when i've first read this book. At first i didn't know what in the world The Egypt Game and it was until that we had to read it for class. I have no particular interest in this book, but if for any, this book is written mainly for girls. I lost my insterest in this book in the beginning when i found out that the Egypt Game was to be a pretend game played by some girls and two ""weird"" boys. And the whole book is kind of just pointless, from the beginning when April had arrived the apartment to the end when the old man saved the kids. Anyway, in conclusion I don't recommend this book to anyone, especially boys."
1,Something is seriously wrong here.,"Are negative stars allowed? If so, I would give it a -*. I truly haven't read anything worse. Basically, the story is about a group of young freaks who sit around an abandoned lot worshiping the Egyptian gods. I would give away the ending, but it doesn't really have one-just the vague promise (threat?) of a sequel about gypsies. I admit that I and a group of thirty others were forced to read it, and we all hated it. I have liked school books before, for instance, Seth of the Lion People is a great book. This, however, is simply award-winning idiocy. If you like it, go ahead and read it. If not, don't expect it to get better.Also, the last reviewer was correct. My teacher at the time had heard of people reading the book and then making strange sacrifices and such. Just don't take the book seriously and it won't mess you up, however."
2,Egypt,"I liked the book, because it was kind of stupid and funny. It had a spy and other things.I didn't like the book,because it was confusing and the characters were uptight. The story was slow and you always know whats going to happen next."
2,The Egypt Game,"The Egypt Game was, to say the least, a unique book. The author seemed to have a totally different perspective of what went on in the lives of little children. I myself am only 14, so I think I would understand these things a little better than that.The story has a very weak plot, and didn't seem to be getting anywhere, it just dragged on and on not getting anywhere. Strangely enough, as I kept on reading I seemed to be getting myself caught up inside of the imaginations of these little kids.In the end, the book had an exceptional ending, and I was very pleased with the happy ending. I would not recommend this book for those craving action and adventure."
3,The Egypt Game,"The book wasn't very exciting,I think, until they started asking the Thoth (the owl) questions.Then I got interested. I liked the charcters and their personalties but, it was hard to believe that Marshall was 4 years old. Over all I liked the book but, it wasn't one of my favories."
5,'The Egypt Game' Was a wonderful,"This book was amazing! Everything was so vivid and it was a book that couldn't be put down. It is great for readers 9-12 and I loved it! It is amaginative and so creative, a great book!"
1,not the best book,the audible book is $20!!? thag is to much money for a book that i could have bought at the bookstore for only $6.00!! the book is okay but the book js way to expensive on a kindle. i would recommend the book but not the kindle book.
4,cool book!!,"This book is something to read if your bored. Still, it&#65533;s pretty good. It&#65533;s about 6 kids who pretend to be Egyptians. That is, until a murder happens and the kids can&#65533; t play outside. This book is hard to put down. It&#65533;s a book for any occasion. The beginning is bad but, the rest is good. The author really grabs the readers attention. If you want a book about egypt, this is not it. It&#65533;s good but it&#65533;s not great either."
5,Great Book for Young Adults,This was one of the first books that I read as a kid interested in Ancient Egypt and it is one of the books that has lasted with me ever since. The story of the girl and her club which explores Ancient Egypt is great for any kid who wants to have a glimpse into Egypt and how it brings everyone together.
4,The Egypt Game,"In The Egypt Game written by Zilpha Keatley Snyder, a girl named April Hall moves into a apartment called the Casa Rosada. There she meets a girl named Melanie Ross and her brother Marshal. The three of them start a game about Egypt in a storage yard that belongs to an old man called the professor. As time goes on, three more members join the Egypt Game, but it remains a secret to every one else. I would recommend this book if you like learn about Egypt."
3,Egypt Game: The greatest Secret of Mystery,"This book was about a girl named April. She is new to the neighborhood and is welcomed by the Ross's family. April and the the Ross's children (Melanie and marshall) start the Egypt Game. After awhile two new boys from school have to join. Their names are Toby and Ken. Toby is excited about joining, but Ken is just doing it because of Toby. More exciting and fun things happen throuhout this book. I didn't like this book because some of it was boring. I liked this book because it was exciting at alot of parts. The author of The Egypt Game is Zilpha Keatley Snyder."
2,Took to long to get good!,"I think that this book took to long to get interesting. I painfully read 17 chapters with no entertianment. The book took a while to get good but when it did, It was very much worth reading. I was givin this book so I did not rent or buy it, but If I had bought it I would probably as for a refund so dont waist your money on it here, check it out from the library first. Then If you like it come back."
2,The Egypt Game,"I found THE EGYPT GAME kinda dragged on. It seemed really long, and didn't have that many high points to the story. But it was overall a okay book. The murder spooked me a bit, but it all really seemed not that interesting. Throughout the whole book I found myself falling asleep. I would read it again if I had to, but I wouldn't recommend it."
5,The Egypt Game,I like this book because it has a lot of imagination.I am reading this book in a book club. I think when you read it in a book club it helps.I totel disigree with Rachel Jones she is so so so so so so sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo wrong !
5,Childhood Favourite,"This was one of my childhood favourites many years ago. I can't say I remember the story well now, but I still remember the ravenous way I read all of Snyder's books as a child, the way I hunted bookstores on every vacation for her books, and the way this one (along with The Velvet Room) was my favourite. I remember the feeling of sharing a secret with the characters, and the magic of their game. And I've been interested in Ancient Egypt ever since."
2,The Egypt Game,"I didn't like this book.It's a mystery about a murder.lt's kind of exciting,but not that much.If you like books that are about games then you should read this book.Also it has really weird names that you don't know what the heck they mean.If you love Egypt and mysteries then this book was made for you.I don't know why anybody would like this book.It's a great time waster too.The book was really dumb.This book stinks!"
4,I read this book 16 years ago and still remember it!!!,I read this book when I was a child. I am sitting here thinking of all of my favorite books that I read as a child and looking them up. I am fascinated to see so many mixed emotions over this book. I read it for an english class book report in 6th grade and I loved the book. HINT CHILDREN: It doesn't feel like work when you pick something that you really enjoy to read to do your reports on!! I guess it had enough of an impact on me to even remember it!! It stirs the imagination. I am just trying to relive some of my favorite childhood books again and get ideas for great books to share with my own child. Great books leave such an impact. I hope one day the children of today will remember their favorite books!! It is time for me to reread this book and read The Gypsy Game. I didn't even know about that book.
4,"Good, cheap, comfortable","The shorts fit well, and don't get in the way. They dry quickly, but not exactly fast, specially if right after you swim you throw them inside your locker."
4,KRUPS R466-71 CRYSTAL AROME 10 CUP COFFEE MAKER WHITE,"I Purchased the krups 10 cup recondtioned coffee maker and im very pleased it looks brand new,makes great coffee takes up little counter space,makes coffee in snap, love the design i love krups products in general,you do have to replace duo water filters im guessing probably twice year you can purchase these filter over the internet for i think you get two filters for 10.00 so thats not two bad, the only thing i didnt like was the lid doesnt pop up for easy cleaning but i just put it in the dish washer and it comes out clean so if your on budget or just want a great coffee maker this is the unit for you"
4,Yee Haw Anal Probe,"This is a must see sci-fi comedy. The one and only independent comedy I can watch again and again, and still laugh my ass off. Crazy rednecks chasing aliens through the hills of Arkansas and crazy aliens abducted rednecks for sexual entertainment. Hilarious non-stop action with tons of awesome special effects including flying saucers, giant alien costumes, and laser guns that vaporize anything they hit. The flying saucer interiors are dressed like a MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 set which adds to the humorous overtones. From Adam Hackbarth, Patrick Voss and Eric Stanze comes INBRED REDNECK ALIEN ABDUCTION."
2,Would not see again,The whole movie needs to be edited. Jokes start off funny but lose it because they go on and on. I think it would have worked if it was a 20 minute short.
2,"Buttoms are hard to press, short range","As stated above the buttons are lower than the plastic that surround them. I have tried to use this while wearing gloves and it is very difficult the push the button down. Also, the range seems rather short in order for the remote to communicate with the receiver (about 30 feet or less)."
1,Don't buy,"I have installed Skylink products in the past and have had very good results but this product model unit is a very poor device.This transmitter and reciever does not have any range of transmission, at times I need to keep pushing the button before the garage door will open or close.This is too bad because a lot of skylink products are very good devises and have worked well for me in the past. I use the product as a interface for my new in car transmitter. It programmed OK and works but as I stated NO RANGE Of Transmission I need to be in the driveway to open the door.My suggestion is Amazon should not inventory this device."
5,A definite must have!!!!,Anyone who is mildly intersted or intensely obsessed with the American Revolution needs to have this reference on their bookshelf!!
4,Encyclopedia of the American Revooution,"This is a very good book but not as perfect as I expected. Many items that I expected to be separate entries or details in this book are missing (eg Sybil Ludington, Fishkill Continental depot, burial site of Benedict Arnold, etc.), which was disappointing, but it is otherwise an excellent source of information. Information is unbiased due to citations. Maps are clear and helpful. I purchased this book from Amazon and the condition was as advertised; I received it during the scheduled delivery period."
5,Great product,"I have been using this product for over one year. It has helped me immensely in my efforts to keep my weight down and blood sugar regulated. When I ran out I thought ""no big deal"" but I immediately noticed the difference and had to re-order. I am not big on supplements, I only take vitamin D during the non summer months and EPA/DHA year round. I prefer to get all my supplementation from food; however, this is one product that I will continue to take year round. It balances my blood sugar and increases my metabolism, which in effect helps maintain my weight. It also has several other health promoting ingredients. I recommend this product to anyone who is serious about maintaining a healthy weight and stabilizing their blood sugar. New Chapter is second to none!"
4,more energy,"I recently purchased this product along with New Chapter Zyflamend... I do not know which of these two products is giving me more energy, but I have it and I am grateful... after struggling with extreme fatigue for over 2 years within the week of my receiving these two New Chapter products and taking them I started to feel much better...I intend to re-order when the bottles I have start to get low.. I feel like they have been a big help to me and I have had no adverse side effects while taking them.The difference between struggling to get through each day with constant fatigue and how I feel now is like night and day."
1,New Title: Idiots on a Boat,"Basically, ""Donkey Punch"" is about a bunch of idiots who do really stupid things for about an hour and a half. The ""film"" concerns another one of those ""we killed someone and lets cover it up"" plots. Of course, nothing goes the way the characters want and they all end up paying for their transgressions. The problem with the film is that the characters are all isolated on a yacht out at sea. While the yacht is pretty cool, there is not many places to hide or do much else so the tension is more or less evaporated and comes down to who is going to kill who next. None of the characters seem to behave in any sort of realistic way and thus I must assume they are all idiots. The film contains some full frontal male nudity which I guess was thrown in so that there would be something to talk about. What was not included was any sort of plot or characters that were at all interesting. This same movie might have made a better comedy."
1,"Terrible: Porn, bad writing, slashing.","What an awful film. There were some moments during which I thought it would be an ""ok"" flick. But, as soon as the women got on a yacht with men they had never met, everything went downhill. The amateur porn was completely unnecessary. Once that passed, there were some suspenseful moments, but whatever little merit the film had deteriorated during the last 15 minutes. What a stupid ending and a waste of time."
3,Not a bad movie,"I read a few of the reviews about how horrible this movie was but i wanted to watch it anyway and honestly, i don't think it was too bad. The story line was good and the acting was ok. It's not much of a mystery but very suspenseful. I like movies where i know what's going on, my only thought is ""ok, how are you gonna get out of this one"". So overall, I didn't feel like a time waster at all."
3,An interesting thriller that makes good on its title,"An engaging little thriller whose title will either repell you or have you at hello, Donkey Punch is an interesting film that will hold your interest. The story involves the meeting of three girls and four guys, who take to a yacht to party on the ocean. Drugs and sex soon follow, as does the act that the title of the film implies, which doesn't go well for anyone involved either. Soon enough, everyone is at each other's throats, and a bloody battle for survival escalates. Donkey Punch is not without its shocking scenes of violence and occasional inventive kills, but the film as a whole ends up being predictable and not well-paced. Still, in terms of sex and violence, Donkey Punch heartily delivers the goods, and while it pushes the suspension of disbelief the longer it goes on, it remains an interesting thriller from across the pond that will hold your interest."
5,A Wonderful Classic!,"Why is this little book out of print? My son and I absolutely LOVED it (wore it out), and now I want my grandson to enjoy it. The fact that it's three little boy characters that try to bake cookies and watch a scary movie, make it all the funnier! All children have sleepovers; tell spooky stories; and eat too many sweets. That's why kids can relate to this adorable book! This is one book that should stay in print for generations to enjoy!"
4,MST3K - always a win,"Space Mutiny is one of my fav MST3K episodes ever. I do wish it had been available on its own, but I can hardly complain when I can get 3 more episodes. As always, hilarity ensues."
3,I waited for this?,"After months of patient waiting for volume 4, I simply can't believe that Rhino would do this to us. After years of watching the same episodes OVER AND OVER AND OVER on Scifi every Saturday morning, they actually release four of those same episodes. Heck, I just watched ""Girl in Gold Boots"" THIS SATURDAY, and I'm sure some of you did too! I'm afraid that I'm just going to have to wait for the next collection and hope for the best... I just can't see spending the $ on this collection."
5,greatest show ever,this is another great set of mystery science theater shows it has 4 episodes from the scifi era. on that note you soon will not be able to see sci fi episodes because they are canceling the show this january. this collection looks to be better than the first three because it has alternate host segments with mike. I cannot wait until nov 18 to get this and I hope Rhino puts out more. update its not alternate host scenes but new intros with mike. there pretty short but its better than nothing. still a great set.
2,Poor choice of titles but I bought it anyway,"All good episodes (especially SPACE MUTINY) but why a box set of shows that are still in reruns on Sci-Fi? I was looking forward to a truly eclectic set this time around; but all of these shows have been aired ad nauseum (GOLD BOOTS and OVERDRAWN ran again in November, HAMLET again in December, etc.) Yawn.Of course we all envision our ""dream set"": mine would be TIME OF THE APES, MAGIC VOYAGE OF SINBAD, DAY THE EARTH FROZE and MIGHTY JACK."
2,We love Joel!,"Can't we just get one volume with all-Joel episodes? There was a group of us that would watch every weekend when MST-3K first started, and we all stopped watching when Joel left. I continue to be disappointed in the DVD volumes, as they are so ""Mike-centric."""
2,Nothing new here,"The book is cleverly laid out, with good illustraions and cute cartoons, but the craft ideas are really lame. If you're looking for interesting or unusual ideas, try Hocus Pocus: Halloween Crafts for a Spooktacular Holiday by Martingale and Company. Everything from invitations to decorations and food."
4,Good Game. Couple Issues.,"This is a great game but there are a couple problems. If you hit the Prone key to lay on the ground and shoot, your accuracy instantly goes perfect. This leads to tons of players instantly hitting the ground when they see an enemy, a tactic known as 'dolphin diving'."
5,Good platform,"This game is good for people who are looking for some competition and a challenge.. the single player is basically a simulation of multi player (counter strike) but is either way too easy or the ai is unpredictable and dont help with getting good.. plus it gets old after a while...multiplayer amazing, great shooter and easy to get used to"
1,Dont BUY this! bad CD key for the 2nd TIME!,Sent the game back because the keys was no good. This is DVD number two with bad keys. Also the game is a UK version and did not have the latest patch on it.
4,Battlefield 2 awsome,"This is a great game however, not like the usual FPS. The next Battlefield will more like what we are used to in FPS games. Still a great game once you get used to it."
1,Invalid key,"The key I received was invalid. I requested help from AMAZON, and promptly received another code. Still invalid.I already had Battlefield 2 installed on my PC and loved that game. But I wanted to have the Complete Edition.Because of the invalid code, now I cannot use my Battlefield 2 edition that previously worked on my computer. When I try to play on any server I get the ""Invalid Key"" error. Uninstalling the game leaves some registries on my computer which do not allow me to reinstall the previous edition I had.Now I need to spend hours on the internet to find a solution so I can reinstall the previous edition on my computer.All this ""FUN"" for $5 sale. :(Very bad experience.P.S. I am a big fan of the Battlefield 2 (NOT the Complete Edition).P.S.2 Amazon Customer Service was prompt and great. The problem was with the software."
2,Did not work online multiplayer,Could not get to work with online multiplayer. Had to get ahold of EA and they gave me a download which worked. Only problem with that is you cant do mods with either one. Gotta have the hard copy. Not very happy with the way this turned out.
2,FUN GAME! (when you can get it to work...),"The first time I got this game to work, it was great! It's almost like a newer version of BF Vietnam in a modern setting. The game overall is pretty darn cool.....BUT, I hate the fact that there's no co-op multiplayer (which enables bots)....and also I've spent WAY more time just TRYING to get this game to work consistently than I have actually played it. It will work one time, but not the next. Finally I gave up.."
4,BF2,"Battle field 2 is still alive and kicking. There are a few servers at 64 of 64 player and it's loads of fun. The biggest down side has to be the maps though. When played at their largest size they leave the foot soldier rather obsolete, but when that reasonably sized map shows up it's better than Call of Duty any day. Try the demo to decide. It does a reasonable job of letting you know how fun the game is."
5,Every Battle Imagined for 1 Low Price,"This game will out last any 1st person shooter story line by 100 fold. Every battle is different.It took a while to install and set up (almost 2 hours) but, was well worth the wait. Installation went smoothly. Just follow the directions included in the booklet. The hardest part was coming up with a screen name.Get a smoking computer (dual core with at least 2Gb Ram), a good high end Video card, a sound blaster XFI Fatal1ty Pro sound card, some head phones with a mic and a joy stick (for the jets), load up this game and lets play WAR!See you on the Battlefield!"
1,I don't even,"I bought this because I love battlefield 2, but for whatever reason after I installed it I couldn't play online due to serial key error or something like that. I don't know if this was Amazons or EAs fault, but as expected EA didn't help me at all with it so I basically threw away 5$ if you want my advice buy it on steam."
4,"a large scale, strategic, tactical, awesome game","This game is fantastic for the strategic first person shooter. Its not a run and gun game like counterstrike or call of duty. It takes a bit of smarts to conquer your enemies.PROS: action packed, alot of great maps, weapons, and vehicles. Gameplay organization such as squads, commander, and orders, is well made, organized, and quick to access when under intense enemy fire for example.Cons: Yes the multiplayer system is really great, but finding a server that is tactical and focuses on squad and commander cooperation by voice or ingame commands is difficult. If you want a real strategy experence, joining a clan might be helpful.Other: Besides the ""finding the right server"" which cant be helped by the creators obviously, it is an awesome fps and deserves consideration for gamers, even though it may be a bit old (2005)."
3,Great Game but with Strings Attached,"First off let me say that the package is true you do need a HIGH SPEED internet connection to play this game. I have a low speed connection(Dial Up) and it would not work for me. There is a single player with the game and if you are looking for mindless fun or a practice for when you play against pros then buy this game. However, i do feel the game needed a story to help the multiplayer as well as the Single Player. Also the game benefits Air power and aromor more than infantry when it should have all been more even. Also you should have more option when you are starting out and not be limited to the stock kits you start out with. That could have helped newbies gain more ranks quicker. All in all a good game not great but more of a jack of all trades."
4,Nice,"Pros:- Good graphics- Good playability- Good Fun/Realism balance- Interesting improvements over previous Battlefield releases- Good ""All in one"" package- Good 'teamspeak' solutionCons:- Requires much more memory resources than previous battlefield versions- Requires much more video resources to achieve full graphic quality- Takes a long time to 'boot' the game- Takes like 'infinite' time to swap between the mods in a standard machine- Needs a different profile for online gaming, which is annoyingMy Recommendation:Buy this game and also buy BF1942/BFVietnam Complete Pack.That way you have all the pros and cons of each of these versions and you'll never be bored."
1,Do not buy!,Here's the problem with this game you cant register the expacs. So you cant play online because all the servers that actually have people use the expacs and with Origin you cant register this game because its old and EA is the worst company ever.
2,Battlefield 2,BF 1942 was my favofite game so I was excited when BF 2 came out. Unfortunatly it was somewhat dissapointing. I didnt like how small the maps were the most. The game was ok but kind of lame. No improvement over BF 1942.
1,Do not buy this game!,"I bought this game for direct download and received a CD key. After installation I tried to join a multi-player game but couldn't because apparently I have an ""Invalid CD Key."" I contacted Amazon and they told me that unfortunately they could do nothing about it. Some punk probably used a key generator and is using the CD which I legitimately purchased. I went through forums and every site I could find to correct this problem to no avail. Don't but this game."
3,old game very inaccurate guns,"One must remember this is an old game and you get what comes with a old game... poor graphics, rough feel, very inaccurate guns and no one to play online with."
2,I feel there is a lot of deception going on here,the game worked fine and it's a lot of funthe problem is that it doesn't include Euro forces and armored fury.I tried to contact a lot of peopleno one helpedamazon...not their problemEA...didn't answertried downloading 2 patches as it was indicated online that I needed them to get euro forces and armored furyit didn't work....pretty much a waste of timefor everyone around who is not aware selling a product and claiming that it's something that it's not it's illegalwe could all sue if we cared that much but we don't.AMAZON NEVER INDICATED THAT WE HAD TO DOWNLOAD A PATCH OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT TO GET THE WHOLE GAME..that's what i'm angry about.
3,Battlefield 2 Collection,Its fun. Its addictive. A better version of 1942 with unlockable weapons and gear (supposedly). Lots of hackers on the servers and whiny bitches too. Get good quick or it just wont be that much fun. Lots of admins get angry really fast over nothing.
4,To Check to see if it will work on your system...,"If you want to check to see if the game will run on your system, you should Google search the BF2 Demo. Its basically the same gaming engine, so if the demo is having issues on your PC, than chances are, so will the full game.Of course patches are released in order to address common problems, but its foolish to assume that a patch will fix a hardware problem / conflict.Bottom Line:Download the demo to check if it will run on your system!!!!!!!"
5,Great Classic Game,I bought this game a month ago. I liked it on Xbox and wanted to try it for computer. The best part is online play is free. Its a lot of fun would and I would recommend it to anyone.
4,Good,"Haven't been able to play at all with the key code provided by amazon, hope they help me fix this, register with ea and still don't let me play the game, invalid cd key!. Guess now i have to download from EADM and see what happen.Edit:After watching Steam Forums, the problem was with EA, they have several problems with the cd keys, one guy posted a fix in those forum and now everything works fine. Thank you amazon.com"
2,Love the game - not useful format.,"I bought this just to repurchase the expansion packs, which I had already bought online from EA Games but had stopped working.(Buying games online from EA was a waste of money - they didn't work when I tried to use them years later. Maybe because of the dreadful Origin. Buy fixed media!)I was unable to read the DVD on my gaming PC and was unable to install by copying the contents to my gaming machine from a machine that would read the DVD. In the end I discovered that the expansion packs are now free with the 1.5 patch to BF2 so buying this DVD was unnecessary since I already owned BF2."
3,CD Key Invalid?,"I purchased this game again to re-visit my account I played on for quite a few years. However, not sure if it's a Windows 7 issue or what. I got the error ""CD Key is Invalid"" I had to use a 3rd party program to get my CD Key to register properly."
1,it wont work,"unlike other people, i had no problem with the product keys. but it made me download game spy comrade, which stopped working soon after installation. the first time i played, i played campaign, and things with smoothly, but i had to get off my computer after less than a minute. next time i tried to play, things went smothly until i started the game. then it froze on me and wouldnt let me do anything. i had to shut down my computer and restart it, and when i tried again, same thing happened. i tried to get it to download on origin, but it listed it was a non-origin product, so it was in my games library, but still didnt work. any ideas on how to fix this?"
1,Broken,"Make now mistake this game is very good. I have and play BF2, Had to reinstall everything on PC and figured it would be easier to install Complete Collection instead of all the patches. Keep getting CD key error and cant paly online as previously mentioned by others."
2,Invalid Key,I purchased this and I cannot play online because I was given an invalid key. Now I am stuck playing single player.
5,From before EA started producing crappy games!,"An excellent game, though not necessarily realistic. If you've ever played the Play4Free version, it's like that, but there are more classes that specialize even more, and the weapon balance is actually good. If you want to really experience this game, though, you should grab a few mods for it."
4,"Outdated, but still good","This is a very outdated game. Everyone knows that. But being outdated does not mean that it is a bad game. This is an excellent game. The graphics are acceptable, although nothing like Battlefield 3. The gameplay is great and the maps are masterpieces. If you are looking for a cool looking, graphically amazing game, go look at BF3 or Black Ops. But if you just want to have fun, get this game."
3,Fun gaming for older computers,"I purchased this game to play with family because most of them are running on old hardware. It is fun and functional, but I have to say the developers spent a little to much time with their data collection screens and installation requirements. Other than that it's and oldie but a goodie. Graphics are ok game play isn't terribly frustrating and by now most if not all PC should be able to play it effortlessly."
4,"A comprehensive introduction to the concept of ""Democracy""","This book is quite short, but contains a considerable amount of information. It presents the basic history of democratic government systems and provides the reader with brief orientations on the many issues facing democratic systems, including problems of majority rule, methods of fair and useful representation, etc.Before someone really starts to dive into the science of decided what is healthy and unhealthy for a Democracy, they should take a day out to read this book, so they really know what they're talking about."
2,Disapointed,The really sad thing about this book is that I really liked the first half. We then entered the second half and I was full of anticipation because we were going to see Eydolon but then we entered and we learned almost nothing new. All we learned was that there was a prophecy about Ben and Ellie. Other then that we get introduced to a bunch of new characters that save Ben's life and the heroes foil the evil guys plans. There is no character development unless you count all the characters becoming flattened versions of their original selves. It just seemed that the author didn't know what to do and decided to just kept on adding characters until something clicked in her mind. Unfortunately the end is terribly rushed and everything comes to such an abrupt end you are left saying WHAT? But what's really disappointing about the book is that the book has such a good foundation and it just fails to deliver.
3,Necessary if you connect to a computer via USB,"If you plan on connecting the camera to a computer via a USB connection, then this product is probably a must buy, else you'll drain the batteries a lot. However, if you have some type of Compactflash peripheral (I have one on my HP 1315 printer), then you can copy directly from the card to your PC. Hence, no need to power the camera. If this is your situation, I'd just buy an extra battery, and possible the 12v adapter so you can charge the battery in the car. Unfortunately, the latter is not sold at amazon.com, at least not at the time of this writing..."
1,junk. it does nothing for you,"looking at canon's website and seeing this charger available on the accessories matrix, one would assume that it would power the camera. it does, kinda, the power goes into the battery compartment. so you can not chage a battery with this device. it only powers the camera if you are using the usb connector. it is practically useless."
3,my experience,It is listed as being adaptable to many types of cameras but in fact are not because when I purchased it it was not compatable with my camera.
3,A fun 3/5 worth $30.00 game,"I was actually able to pickup this game for $20.00 a week ago, and have been blasting through the missions. The flight controls take some getting used to, but once you know them, flying around is a lot of fun. Unlimited missiles and ammo is a bit unrealistic, but fine for this type of arcade title.What's lacking?- Multiplayer support (vs or coop would have been nice)- Next-gen graphics (the Wii's capabilties were not pushed at all)- A compelling storyline (Tie Fighter back in the day had an awesome story)Overall, a fun ride, and worth $30.00 if you can find the game for that price. Hopefully enough people will buy this game, prompting Codemasters to make a sequel incorporating one or more of the above points. Then we'd have a 4/5 or 5/5 title."
2,Your just doing the same things over and over again!,"I don't know where this game went wrong. Okay, its irritating at first but when I got the hang of it I was ready to blow up some planes.Its fun at first , but then I played some more levels and I was asking myself "" Is that it? ""I mean all the levels are pretty much the same. So you're in a plane , then other planes an start shooting at you and you're ordered to shoot them down.I did not even finish this game. So hey, maybe you should buy it[or rent it] and play it all the way through and possibly it will get better.But it just did not fly with me."
4,"Great action play! Simple, but not too simple!","Length:: 2:39 MinsMy only beef with this game is that it's very redundant and unrealistic. However, real life is boring, so they had to put in non-real-world scenarios and give your fighter endless ammo limited only by over-heating. I love the controls of the game, it really adds to the fun! Here's a video of how it all works!"
4,fairly good,This game is pretty fun. I got a Wii for my kids and got this game for me. I have played it twice and had fun both times. I am no game expert by any means so take this for what it is worth.
3,The fun doesn't last long...,"Edited: In hindsight, this game should have been a 2/5.The game has its merits, but it just doesn't last. Being a huge fan of the Wii remote, I thought this and many other games had great potential. This one could have paid off, but instead falls flat.The title of the game gives it away. You're going to be lining yourself up behind an enemy, launching a missile, rinsing and repeating. The variety of gameplay is so limited that it would only last for a very narrow audience. The graphics are rather poor, even considering the way the Wii's graphics have looked since launch. The controls aren't fun either, because while they could have implemented a joystick-style (like in a real cockpit) but instead chose to use a stupid control scheme that makes no sense.Essentially, I'd say stay away from this game unless you get a deal. The controls are interesting but not quite what I (and I'm sure others) would have hoped for, and the variety of gameplay just can't last."
1,the worst gloves ever .... :(,i have bought the same gloves 6 months ago from the maincompany CLC they were great and i'm still using it untilnow but when i bought the same from AMAZON they are toobad and i don't advice any one to buy it from here wheni opened the first valve the gloves started a rapture WTFFrom now on:It is easy: Google - CLC gloves - choose - pay = NO AMAZON Gloves
3,"Awesome, but....","Love the gloves, they do a great job at keeping your hands safe and have amazing grip for any type of task you set up to do.However, they do not last long at ALL. The stitching comes apart steadily and the outside layers come apart as well."
5,Excellent gloves!,"First I was amazed to actually find a pair of extra large gloves that fit. Then when I realized just how comfortable and well padded they were, I've fallen in love.Don't tell the wife. Please?"
5,great for plumbers!,I'm a plumber and have tried many types of gloves from many manufacturers. They all end up destroyed withing a week or so. I got these because they were the most durable I could find. I love them. Had them since a few days after christmas and they are still in good condition. They take a serious beating and have plenty of protection for your knuckles. Great buy for anyone in a trade that needs some good gloves.
1,"Has bought into ""media hype""","I had high hopes for this novel, but unfortunately found it ""echoed"" a lot of the media hype of the adoptee reunion where all ends ""happily ever after."" From learning about many of the bad adoptee reunions out there, I would say this is ridiculous pap for those who like ""romance fiction."" I mean, how many bmoms actually (many years later) ""marry"" the bdads? Very, very few.Only read this is you like ""escapsim fiction."""
3,No habla espanol,"Just warning other gringos that despite the ""product details"" listing the language as ""english"", this release is entirely in spanish - not even english subtitles.That said, it's not too difficult to follow what's going on. Enjoyable if you're a fan of the Luchadore vs Monsters genre. Pretty good prints too."
1,Overpriced and Dry Dry Dry,"This book is so dry I'm choking from the dust. Oh man what a miserable read! Where are the diagrams you would expect to find in a typical book on management. I feel sorry for the Southwest Airlines employees who were forced to use this book as a text. I learned nothing from this book. It's supposed to make you a successful manager, and help you rise to the top. Well, you know they say human waste always floats to the top...and this book was a waste of my money."
5,Excellent reference for any management question.,"Successful Manager's Handbook has been used as the text for all Southwest Airlines Leadership programs. Over 1500 participants have received this invaluable resource and reference guide. The information and tips are practical, precise and right on target."
3,Business Book,Purchased it for business. Of course it's not for personal enjoyment. It's instructive and descriptive as a handbook should be.
1,Don't do it!,"This was a BIG let down. We bought this for our daughter, brought it home and the picture is horrible, unviewable. It jumps and has lines. Tried all of the troubleshooting, brought it back thinking may be it was just that one. Got another from a different store and it did the same thing. Save your money."
2,Not a great purchase,"I have owned one for 3 years and it has done a pretty good job for clean up, but it has vibrated itself to a piece of junk. After the first year it began leaking oil, then due to the vibration it broke out the frame in two places where the engine mounts and the vibration got even worse. Now it is leaking oil from everywhere and is headed for the trash."
1,Not the best,I think I used this 5 times before I trashed it. It kept sliding off my blow-dryer which was frustrating.
4,introduces some pretty patterns and lovely colorways,"15 beautiful quilts featured, only let down is the layout and photography. Done by the author and her daughter, it lacks a little polish - the sort of design which makes Kaffe Fassett books stand out and the quilts zing!With emphasis on pressed flowers and quilts designed from garden views, book covers no new territory but introduces some pretty patterns and lovely colorways.The instructions are not as detailed as one could wish, but it makes a nice little book for browsing through."
3,easy to use but a warning,"I bought this program for my Samsung E317. While it is very easy to make your own ringtones, My phone did not wor. This program will not work with Samsung phones and the company for the software's ""help"" desk is no help at all. Otherwise this is a great item."
3,Cheap enough to try...difficult to work with,"This product is not user-friendly by any means. The instructions are relatively useless if you run into problems. I had to find a backdoor just to use the program as it kept crashing on me when I used the regular buttons.However, once I did figure it out it was smooth sailing. I was able to download the ringtones successfully & it paid for itself in the first 6 downloads.A fairly good value if you are computer literate & patient. If not, go with something more user-friendly."
1,Wouldn't buy again,"This software is not designed well at all. It requires an Internet read phone. Mine is a LG 8100 and it wouldn't get the file over the internet. It won't allow one to use a USB cable. I tried one that I had and it didn't work.However, the the price it wasn't worth sending it back."
2,Altimeter reading wanders,"On the plus side, the watch is easy to set and seems quite durable. However, the altimeter seems overly sensitive to changes in air pressure. Over the course of a few hours, the reading may rise or fall by 200 feet or more."
4,Terminator in South America,"This is novel about a robot designed to kill, but being effected by the emotions that surround him. This is very similar to Terminator 2 but only set in South America jungle.It's is a book that is readable and has lots of action which is forseeable in the name"
2,eh...,"I really enjoyed this book in the beginning. The whole AI aspect I loved and solo's developing intelligence/emotions. However, I did not care about any of the villagers and their lives. In the end, this book just didn't pull me in."
5,Best Fiction,"I enjoyed the book enormously. It is the best fiction book I have read in a long time. The description of the mine in the 1920's was the best I have ever read. Having read all of Tony Hillerman's books, I also liked the Indian connection. And the surprise ending was fun. I think it is an excellent book"
5,One to read,"The Sunnyside War takes the reader into the depths of Utah's Book Cliff coal mines. Here you experience not only the hardships faced by miners in the workplace but the never ending conflict between management and labor. Civish not only captures the struggle of miners to organize but weaves a story incorporating ethnic diversity, class divisions, young love and the passing of the old west The novel reaffirms that it is everyday people who embody the true spirit of America. Having first handknowlede of life in Utah coal camps, I feel Civish has caught the true essence of early Utah coal mining. A highly recommended read"
5,Nuriko,My daughter An and I love this video. It was so sad and disappointed when Nuriko die. He was so much fun and we him so much. We are looking forward to the Quest for Shinzaho video.
5,Untamed Country,Another good book to read in the Wilderness series.Hope to see more books in this series in the future.
5,Will change your life,"This will teach you more about our Lord than you ever heard anywhere. If your goal is to be like Christ, this will help you understand his time here on earth, and help you love Him even more!"
1,Free of Charge,"Probably the worst historical novel I have ever read. One half of the book consists of a syrupy faux-Victorian love story between cardboard characters, the other sounds as if it was lifted verbatim from one of the duller pre-World War I military textbooks. It would seem hard to make the Charge of the Light Brigade sound as exciting as the daily Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, but that is exactly what Ms. Stuart's does. Obviously the publisher is trying to cash in on the current vogue in 18th and 19th century soldier and sailor yarns by republishing this dud, but you'd do better to save your money and re-read the Sharpe series instead."
1,Not recommended,"Way too much romance and too little action. With that said, stuart offers one of the most complete explanations for the miscomunication that led to the ill fated charge of the light brigade. Read the last 20 pages and skip the rest."
4,Fully met and exceeded my expectations,"Just rec'd the chipper, opened assembled and fired it up in about 15 min. It fully meets and exceeds my expectations and requirements. It should be able to handle what I throw at it. I will burn any limbs over 2"" so most of my stuff is downed leaves from trees and is mostly about 1.5"" or less. It seems to easily handle these without too much pain (other chippers I've used in the pass require you to push the material into the shoot, this really vibrates your hand). This model draws in the material pretty well.It is extremely loud, but I expect it is the nature of the beast (chippers). I'm not sure how you could flail steels cutters around at a high speed while grinding hard wood to dust without making a huge racket. I'm sure my neighbors will not be happy I got I have a chipper . . . but I am."
5,chipper,This product met all my expectations and some. Worked right out of the box and after several days of use it is still working fine.
2,Ho-hum... back to watching the original El Hazard,"The original El Hazard had one of the most beautiful, touching endings that I've ever seen, animated or not. The only words I could use to describe this ending without giving too much away is 'abrupt' and 'anti-climatic'. Oh well. You win some, you lose some."
1,Keep Looking,"This documentary is a product of this generation's anti-hero and anti-English white man bent. Heroic, innocent Indians are the major theme, and their savagery is excused by every means possible. Major battles are left out, making room for more commentary on George Washington's self-serfving ambitions. How the producers could read his mind so thoroughly is beyond me. To their credit, or more likely because they were ashamed not to, they even allowed one of Washington's references to his reliance on ""Providence"" to be included. Keep your money. I threw this video in the trash can as soon as I had finished it."
2,A Bias look at a war often overlooked.,"A bias look at a war often overlooked. I hate that I am forced to give a negative review on this as I wish more videos were out there on the subject.Pros: Great video visually. Finally a video on the French and Indian War! It is an overview of the war.Cons: This production spends more time attempting to convince you that George Washington was a frightened fool with weak skills as a leader. This is unfounded and irresponsible. Why add something like this which is nothing more than an opinion of the author? This also discusses the Indians in a positive light, ignoring the atrocities they committed to focus solely on those of the English. One is left feeling that the English were lucky in victory when history does not support this. This isn't the first time a PBS production has tried to rewrite history to their views today. It's too bad as it had great potential."
3,action and movemet was varied and choppy,"This story, which held so much promise as a true documentary film was under-cut by the 2 directors who tried to make it into a docu-drama, and in doing so omitted and/or glossed over some of the finer facts and details of the tremendous saga that our future president withstood in his real trial by fire. The era, physical setting and the various film sets were much more deserving of a longer and more detailed (and more accurate!) development as to the true character and personality of George Washington."
5,"Guys, Take A Look","I picked up the book after seeing it on my girlfriends coffee table and I couldn't put it down. The author doesn't get overly scientific and she knows what she's talking about. Finally, someone offers an understandable and accurate description of how the ""g-spot"" works. The chapter on drugs and sex was incredibly informative as well.I highly recommend this book to any guy interested in receiving rave reviews from his partner, whether she's your long-term girlfriend or a one-night rendezvous."
1,More of the same nothing new,"More of the same sex talk. Not much new data. The pictures where cool, but not what I expected in general."
2,An alright book,This book is okay if you are just getting into Green Day and want to know more about them. But the information can all easily be found on internet sites. If you really want to know a lot about Green Day just go on Yahoo and search around. You'll find more that what's in this book. The pictures are good though.
5,mickey rooney foever young 4 movie pack,"4 good movies in one pack for a great price. Mickey Rooney fans would love it!! The big wheel, My outlaw brother, Quicksand & Love laughs at Andy Hardy"
5,an awesome cd,"these are the hymns that i was raised with and learned to cherish. on this cd the listener will hear the hymns that have sustained generation after generation to weather the storms of life.in this cd there are 10 different medleys,each containing a common theme. these hymns are a done in a smooth style that is condusive to meditation and to silent reflection. if this is your kind of worship[quiet and reflective] then this beautiful music is for you.also,there are orchestral interludes that emphasize the beauty of the entire musical experience. ------richard bennett-fitzgerald,georgia"
2,"Sadly, no illustrations as in the 4th edition","Probably one of the most helpful features of the previous edition was the illustrations. They showed stage by stage, tumor invasion, size, involvement of other organs, etc. Without the illustrations, you can get along fine with the AJCC TNM Staging Manual. I was very disappointed."
5,Fantastic resource,"This book is a wonderful guide to bike trails. It makes planning trips easy and fun, and it's very descriptive about the specifics of each trail (gravel, grass, paved, etc.)I thought I could just find this info on the internet, but to no avail, so I bought the book. I was nicely surprised that the book is exactly what I needed, good descriptions of each trail and a good map, AND how to get to the beginnings of each trail."
5,Great!!!,It's great. There are a lot of examples. I highly recommended if you are the type of person like to see examples!!
4,I like Mancuso's books! Another hit!,"Anthony Mancuso writes an excellent guide here on forming your own LLC. Step-by-step he takes you through the process. Even if you don't want to do all the groundwork in forming your own LLC, this is an excellent guide to understanding how one operates mechanically. Buy this book especially if you are a small business owner."
4,Great resource,"I'm currently in the process of setting up an LLC for a real estate company, and this book provided much information in the early stages. I also have an attorney involved in the actual structure, but I think that overall this book has made me more prepared to deal with him, and probably have saved me some billed hours because I was able to use some of the information, and also demonstrate to the attorney that I'd done some homework in advance."
4,Informative,The information is written in a way that is easily understood. Definitions are specific yet detailed enough to broaden the reader's scope on the subjects. Also the CD is very helpful.
4,Not for single-member LLCs,"I got this book from my library when I was considering starting a single-member LLC, which is a recommended move for freelancers, independent consultants, and people considering a sole proprietorship. I am adding this review to notify potential buyers that this book does not cover the topic of single-member LLCs. I would like to learn how to conduct my business the ""right"" way, but most of the advice here doesn't apply to me."
3,Your Limited Liability Company,"This book provides adequate background information and resources required for starting up an LLC. I was looking for a little more depth, so it did not meet meet my full expectations."
4,Excellent for forms,"Nolo's book on the operation of a Limited Liability Corporation will be an excellent reference work and compendium of needed forms of all types for small business owners. The book systematically covers forming a company, documenting meetings, loans, motions, ownership, you name it - any legal documents and some simply standardized forms that are generally useful for the administration of an LLC are included in both Word and pdf format, and the use of each is explained and detailed in full.As governments of all tiers demand more and more information on every last little detail in our business (and personal) lives, it behooves every business owner to be as careful and complete as possible, documenting thoroughly the actions of that business. This book is a rich mine of forms and procedures to help the owner do that all without the help of an attorney or accountant, and should be among the reference works of every LLC organization."
4,Helpful context,"I used a book on forming a LLC from NOLO, and was happy to see this book as a follow on -- an operating manual for the annoying paperwork that comes with being an LLC. It is a nice ""crutch"", and though I ignore a lot of things that I would do if I were a ""large"" LLC, at least I know what I'm ignoring.I recommend this book as a guide to let you know what you ""should"" be doing if your LLC was wildly successful, and for peace of mind if your LLC is just a tiny venture like mine...Recommended -- much cheaper than a lawyer, much less annoying than LegalZoom.com!"
5,No more authoritative book on the subject,"Nolo's new ""Your Limited Liability Company: An Operating Manual"" is part of their outstanding series for business owners that deals with the complexities of setting up and running a business. The key differentiators that make Nolo titles like ""Your Limited Liability Company: An Operating Manual"" stand out from the crowd are:* Plain-English approach - written for busy business people* Experienced authors - no academic ivory tower types here* Complete - Each book is comprehensive and leaves few stones unturned* Priced right - You can buy the entire Nolo Small Business library for less than the cost of a few hours of your attorney or accountant's half-hearted time.I've considered a number of LLC-specific titles, but none gives me the sense of authoritativeness that ""Your Limited Liability Company: An Operating Manual"" does. Highly recommended!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"While reading what the book had to offer, I was expecting everything I needed to know about starting and running my own business as an LLC. Well, not exactly.The features of the book seemed to concentrate on meeting declarations and other important aspects to consider, but had nothing about setting up and funding, hiring and taxes. Most of the forms that were tear out pages are on the CD, so this thick book almost is oversold. The operating agreement and the articles of organization are not even included. That is a separate purchase. I had high hopes for this, but this book is really aimed at a company that is started and maybe not running efficiently or has difficulties with scope or focus.This book was way too expensive for what it delivered."
3,Questionable quality and short warranty,"I am very satisfied with the versatility of the design of this charger. However, I have had two chargers stop working. I can't figuere out why they have stoped working because I have never droped them or abused them in any way! I recommend that you research any other optional chargers prior to purchasing this model. This charger only has a 30-day warranty!"
1,Never Recieved!,Quite simply I never have recieved the charger. The company when emailed told me to go find it (the email that gave me the tracking number) as they had too many invoices. See the message below.We have sent you a tracking number. You may check your inbox history. And you could check it on website of usps with the tracking number. I would like to find the tracking number for you but now we could not find because files are many. Thanks.I don't know that I would buy from Vast Mart again.
3,BEWARE THE BOOTLEG/IMPORT!,"A lot of anime selling are Imports or Bootlegs! Be careful who you buy from. Research your seller. ALWAYS send e-mails inquiring if it is an import. Ask how many discs there are, it's a tell-tale sign of bootlegs and imports as they will be much less."
4,A solid anime series,"I only give this 4 stars because I love Gundam Wing best. Sorry. It's a solid series filled with combat, drama, action, and philosophy. It's a good series to collect for your Gundam fans."
5,Best tiny knife I've ever used,"I make lots of apple pies, and last winter when I traveled around the country I made pies for about 20 different hosts. Compared to the many other knives I borrowed to slice and core apples, this one was so good that it was almost like I could cut apples just by holding the knife and looking at them. When I got home I bought one for myself."
2,And They Took It to Their Graves - 2 1/2 Stars,"I'd like to be able to give half star ratings on some of this stuff. 2 1/2 for this one. The title and premise of this book is that the witness and insider accounts of the early days of the flying saucer phenomenon accounted for these fellows disappearing and/or going belly up. And I don't doubt that in some instances that might have been true. I found the book interesting enough to buy because it was such an early account of the phenomenon and as such important because the information was still fresh and strategies for disinformation were still evolving. However, if ""they knew too much"" then they took it to their graves, because the author is unable to relate anything here that would have gotten anyone killed - let alone pestered. Slightly interesting because of its vintage, but if you want to read about the early days then read Donald Keyhoe, Edward Ruppelt, J. Allen Hynek, etc."
3,"Not bad, but not on the mark either","A fairly-good sequel to ATMOM, but not on the mark. From little things (such as the stereotypical authority figure being a villain and the free-spirits the heroes) to excessive emphasis on profanity instead of literary. Good for a beach paperback, but not worthy of Lovecraft.Plus, I have an issue with the book cover. There are no shoggoths in the novel! I want my shoggoths, dangit!!! :-)"
5,Another Winner from Curran,"Tim Curran is a master horror writer. It is criminal that he is not more well known.Hive is the fourth novel by him that I have read and I will be making my way through them all. The story is a sequel to Lovecraft's ""At The Mountains of Madness"" and Curran builds on that story, taking it in his own direction. Where Lovecraft's original story can be a real chore to get through, Hive is a real page turner with never a dull moment.The movie, ""The Thing"" is also clearly an influence and Curran acknowledges that film twice in Hive.I don't really get the negative reviews here. If I was to be critical I could say that I find it unlikely that a city could be in any way intact after several hundred million years, but that is Lovecraft's fault. The cover is misleading too.Strongly recommended along with all Tim Curran."
4,It's fine as a stand-alone novel,"I had very high expectations of book that is supposed to be a sequel to myfavorite H.P.Lovecraft story. My expectations weren't quite met. But, there's plenty of dread to make this a good horror novel, if you can somehow ignore that it's supposed to be a sequel. I've read the novel twice and I enjoyed it more the second time around."
4,Almost a really good book,I enjoy HP Lovecraft. This came close but just did not finish well. A good read for HP fans.
2,"Good Writer, Boring Book!!!","All I can say is, Grrrrrr! This book should have been so much better than it was. It is obvious that this Author can write but what he wasted his talent on was minute details, repeated from chapter to chapter to chapter. When he wanted to be creepy, he was. When he wanted you to feel a sense of awe, he did. When he wanted you to have an opinion about his characters, you had one. However, those were far and few instances and they could not carry the book. The only reason I finished it was because I thought there might be a great ending but I was wrong. Extremely boring and disappointing because you knew by the writing style that this Author could have done way better. I think he was more interested in teaching about something than creating a good read! I do not know if I want to try him again. All his other books sound good but so did this one!"
2,"Unoriginal, but still fun","Tim Curran's HIVE is a workmanlike science fiction horror novel, fun in parts but not earthshaking. Billed as a sequel to H.P.Lovecraft's celebrated novel ""At The Mountains Of Madness"", the book tacks on the entire plot (and most of the set pieces) of Nigel Kneale's BBC serial ""Quatermass and the Pit"", perhaps better known in the US in its movie incarnation as ""Five Million Years To Earth"". To this mix Curran also adds the central conceit of Kneale's last Quatermass story, known in the States as ""The Quatermass Conclusion"", and large chunks of John Carpenter's version of ""The Thing"". The resulting stew is quite entertaining, if heavy-handed in parts.This borrowing doesn't make the book a bad one, but it is annoying as Curran is obviously a skilled writer who - with a little more effort and a decent editor - could be a really good one. Hopefully as Curran continues to write, he'll become confident enough in his abilities to come up with his own plots in future."
2,overwritten Mountains of Madness II,"One of a number of novella sequels to Lovecraft plus ""The Thing"" (actually mentioned in text!) . It repeats several times over. Could see where it was going long before trailing off into completely predictable recycling of one explicit idea. Jones or Price could have edited manuscript into one of their compendia and made it worthwhile instead of hard to read. Not going to get Book II."
4,o.k.,i think there are better do it youself home sewing decorater books out there. this one doesn't have a lot of projects that i will use. nor does it have the great ideas that i've come to expect from waverly.
4,Good value,"Exceptional quality. Roomy for younger group (5th-7th grade), but my 8th grader must carry a 3"", and 2- 1 1/2"" binders plus books and misc. items. It's tough to fit it all in, but he loves the backpack."
4,Excellent and easy music book,Loved it. Easiest music book to learn and read while playing the keyboard. Would tell everyone to buy it today.
1,size problem,pump is too large to fit in the well of my down east lobster boat had to go with a (27d)1100 rule with a 40a rule-a-matic switch mounted fore&aft in ditch ! problem is the 3/4 in. additional width
3,He also did a few nude males.,"Reproductions are pretty good. Text lacks meat although the photos don't. Incidentally, Weston did photograph a few nude males although you wouldn't know it from this book."
5,Works with 4000 series roomba,"Perhaps the most reliable part of our roomba. Have been using for 6 months. Set up the program, push send all, and program the roomba and virtual walls."
4,Clymer Yamaha Shop Manual,"This manual appears to be well laid out and understandable unlike many other ""shop manuals"" that give you only enough information to get you into trouble. I would like to be able to report many successful repairs due to this manual, but after I bought it, I have only needed it for one minor carb. repair. The information was most helpful, though. I have been working on engines for 43 years and I appreciate good and reliable manuals like this one."
2,Tannhauser with Gwyneth,"I found the singing to be quite outstanding on this video. I also found the musical interpretation to be well done. However, I will be looking for another version for my personal library - I was disappointed that there was such a high level of partial to nearly complete nudity in this production."
5,excellent product,"I bought these dies as I couldn't find a reasonably priced set from rcbs (my normal brand) in this caliber. This was my first set of lee dies, and I must say they're much more user friendly than the rcbs sets-no changing seater plugs, and they stay put without the need for the allen screw. I use a single stage press, so the powder-thru-die feature wasn't that important to me, but is a good feature for you progressive guys. My next set of dies will definitely be coming from lee!"
5,Missionary Stories for Juniors,I was very happy first to be able to find this out-of-date book for my grandhcildren. It is even better than what I expected and came very quickly.
3,Dated but still useful at times,"This book contains a number of 'off the beaten path' destinations that are not mentioned in many other guidebooks. As such, that makes it pretty useful. However, the maps are pretty crude, there are no GPS coordinates, and the information is often out of date. For the very low price, however, it is still worth the money."
4,"Great Band, Great Disc!","The first time I saw these guys was almost three years ago (months before ""Rise"" was released) and they blew me away. I finally got to see them for a second time just a few days ago, and they haven't lost a step. I bought the new disc at the show, and I must say it is quite impressive. The standout songs on the disc are ""Long Time coming"" and ""Warning Bells,"" but it is a solid disc from beginning to end. Anyone that is disappointed with this release, my advice to you is to go see them live one time and your opinion will almost certainly change."
2,Disappointed,"The first cd was fantastic. Great upbeat songs. The new one is slow and depressing. If I didn't know better, I would swear it was a completely different band. I went from loving these guys to wishing I hadn't spent the money on the second cd. Very disappointing follow up."
3,WHAT A STEP BACKWARDS THIS IS!!!!!,"......and what an incredible disappointment this CD is. Rise was such a fantastic album, this sounds more like something that that horrible Billy Corgan from the Smashing Pumpkins would record. So many bands record one great CD then screw up what follows.....this is one more to add to that list. Uninspired, boring, dull, lifeless. Sad for a band that showed such promise with Rise."
3,The worse of the two albums...,"I loved Man's Myth, but Mutant, to me, was just okay. Twiztid said before either album was ever released that Man's Myth would have more of a rap sound and Mutant would have more of a rock sound, so I already knew which one I would like more. Even though I wasn't that big on this one, it does have some good songs, like ""Triple Threat"" and ""Respirator."" Even though Twiztid has the potential to do much better, this is still better than some of the crap that Psychopathic tries to put out."
5,i hated twiztid but now i don't,i am a huge ass juggalo but could never get into twiztid no matter how hard i tried. i love icp abk blaze esham and jumpsteady but i didn't like twiztid. but then this dropped. I think this is the best psychopathic album ever. very different. just buy it juggalos.
5,METAL,twiztid shows they can change it up and great they sould do another rock album all the rock songs on this cd are great family love whoop whoop
5,Individual release of disc #1 from the Platinum Blu-ray release,"This is only for the casual fan who wants a sampling of Looney Tunes on Blu-ray. This is a stellar group of titles sure to please all. If you can not get the 3-disc set then get this.Disc #1 from the 3-disc Platinum Blu-ray release is presented here as an individual release.HARE TONICBASEBALL BUGSBUCCANEER BUNNYTHE OLD GREY HARERABBIT HOOD8 BALL BUNNYRABBIT OF SEVILLEWHAT'S OPERA, DOC?THE GREAT PIGGY BANK ROBBERYA PEST IN THE HOUSETHE SCARLET PUMPERNICKELDUCK AMUCKROBIN HOOD DAFFYBABY BOTTLENECKKITTY KORNEREDSCAREDY CATPORKY CHOPSOLD GLORYA TALE OF TWO KITTIESTWEETIE PIEFAST AND FURRY-OUSBEEP, BEEPLOVELORN LEGHORNFOR SCENT-IMENTAL REASONSSPEEDY GONZALES+ 6 BEHIND THE TUNES (FEATURETTES)Wagnerian Wabbit: The Making of What's Opera, Doc?Twilight in Tunes: The Music of Raymond ScottPowerhouse in PicturesPutty Problems and Canary RowsA Chuck Jones Tutorial: Tricks of the Cartoon TradeThe Charm of Stink: On the Scent of Pepé le Pew"
3,Enjoyed,The product arrived very quickly. Was exactly as described in advertisement. Price was very reasonable. Would recommend to those with children.
1,"WB, did you ran out of looney tunes?!","Unbelievable... I just found out that this disc is the first disc of the Platinum Collection (which has three discs), double dipped in the same sauce, renamed as Showcase. Shame on you, WB, I almost bought this for my child - what a disappointment would have been for him!I suggest other different names for future releases of the same disc:""Looney tunes Prime""""This is Looney Tunes - Vol. 1""""This is Looney Tunes - Vol. I""""This is Looney Tunes - Volume One""Shame on you, Warner Bros. [please note, the second ""Shame on you has the name of the company spelled out, therefore it is a different statement]This is a case for the BBB."
1,Give us something new,Can't WB give us more unreleased cartoons? People who would buy a 1 disc Blu ray from the Platinum set will be perfectly happy with the DVDs already in circulation. You guys just can't get it right.
2,DeLorme GPS ..get ready for headaches,"I have been using this laptop DeLorme GPS program for 2 months..It is so user unfreindly....I got the basics down but all the other functions are a mystery..I am a ten year computer user and just feel the whole set up from the tiny fonts to the jumping around of the screen make this program no fun at all. Try calling customer service, if they answer within 20 minutes your lucky ..and the help is limited..look for other programs first."
1,Hands down the WORST option out there!,"I have owned the 2006 version of this program since it came out. I travel for a living and have used it on both coasts and in the midwest EXTENSIVELY. The ONLY thing it is good for is giving you a rough idea of how long your trip will take. THE MAPS ABSOULETLY STINK EVERYWHERE!!!!! There is a MAJOR 4 lane hiway near my home (Hwy 2 from Lincoln NE to Nebraska City, NE) that has been there for 5 to 10 years and it isn't even on the map (It still shows the old 2 lane hwy 2 and tries to redirect you OVER AND OVER AND OVER again). I have found this also in at least 2 other states. It has even directed me to the wrong TOWN!!! (In California when I was going to Stanford University)SAVE YOURSELF SOME HEADACHE AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!!!"
1,Very Bad Product,"I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad. The review by ""Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich"" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again. But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.The summary of this product is that it is ""highly unusable"". You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again. Yes, you can ""manage"" you way with this product. However it is not worth your time and money.And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on!"
2,Delorme Earthmate GPS LT-20,I'm not at all satisfied with this product. I also own Microsofts GPS and I like it very much. I had the Microsoft one first and wanted to try this to see which is better.
3,Wait for 2006 version,"I went ahead and purchased from Amazon understanding that a free coupon was included for the upgrade to the 2006 version - well it isn't really free - you have to pay $9.95 ""shipping and handling"".....wait for the 2006 version and save!"
3,Good product but new version coming,In August Delorme will be releasing Street Atlas 2006 and it will offer the optional bundle with the Earthmate GPS unit.I would wait till then. My version of Street Atlas 2005 is fine but the maps are a bit outdated. hopefully the new software will correct some of those things.
4,shame on Earthmate GPS LT-20 tutorial,The delorme earthmate GPS LT-20 works really well. I used it for navigational assistance during my vacation and it really works good. But the built in tutorial is pretty sad at best. I had to play with the unit for about 2 days to figure out how it works. I think delorme needs to do a better job of a tutorial....maybe if I had used another GPS unit it might have been easier for me but this was my first time using GPS. It really does work great once you figure it out.The website for delorme did not offer much help either on product use.
4,Great for aid to navigation,"Just replaced 2004 with 2006 Not much better but easier to use for windows junkies. Very accurate gps but sometimes the maping software, as with all, needs improvement. Use it extensively for back roads and it has saved us several times.Will buy again if needed."
5,Works well,"Don't forget to download the serial driver from the Delorme site so you can use the USB GPS with other programs.After installing the driver, Netstumbler immediately recognized it."
4,Its pretty good if you use it with different GPS software,"Its a great GPS once its starts and detects the satellites (sometimes it can take up to 5 mins). I used it with iGuidance and that software is the whole world of difference. I can actually hear what the direction are saying vs the software that came with the GPS unit (robotic sounds, need to subtitle that for me PLEASE!)"
3,not for truckers,"If you are a truck diver this is not for you, it help a lillte bit but it gives sometimes routes that are not good for trukers like , thru mountains even trying to choose just interstates."
1,Terrible Software,"The software for this system is so horrible, I doubt even the developers could figure out some of the features. I'm an experienced engineer, and I couldn't figure out how to get the thing to easily navigate to a Walmart once it was found on their database. Their database is also terrible, and doesn't include things like drug stores.I don't even want to waste my time on this review, it's that terrible...I develop software for experienced technical professionals, and if my software engineers gave me this they'd be out of a job.Good Luck."
1,Too bad he lowest rating is 1 star,"There's a reason why this stuff is significantly discounted. This is definitely one of the worst products I have ever bought. I did not do much research. I think the data may be in there, but I could not learn how to make it work. The interface is horrific - unusable. Don't do it."
3,GPS good Mapping lots of errors,"The GPS LT-20 is a great device and is fairly accurate. The problem is the Delorme maps, they have so many errors and interstare ramp data is inaccurate or sometimes even missing. The estimated time of arrival and time to turn is determined by the speeds that you set and estimate that you will travel on different roads and does is not determined by your actual speed which the GPS can calculate. I don't understand how a company that is a map maker can but out such bad street maps. I think they should get them from Garmin, Wish I could use this GPS with other mapping software. 2006 Street Atlus was some inprovement but still filled with street errors.Bob B"
1,Difficult to use,"We started with a Kenwood navigator with touch screen at $3000; liked it but the database was extremely poor and an updated DVD is $450. Tried DeLorme; not at all user friendly and had annoying, perhaps fatal, characteristic of showing a turn 1/10 mile after the turn--but then sometimes it would show the turn where it was supposed to be. Microsoft Streets & Trips is user friendly, intuitive, and works well--database is excellent."
3,Meh,"I was VERY excited to read this book. I LOVE the title and description. However, it was very much too slow for my taste. I'm very into focusing on the positive and verbalizing it as well as acting on it, but this book was simply too difficult to read and I wasn't able to finish it because it was so slow."
3,Good information but a little underdone,The indestructible book had a lot of very good information. I was riveted through each segment and even took notes the second time through so I could recall the information later. And the segments where each an hour which was a perfect amount of time for this deep of material.My only complaint is that I was expecting atleast American PBS quality and didn't see it. It looked to be made for British tv and the sound quality of the DVDs and the microphone quality of the presenter left a little to be desired. But like I said before it was all great information and I feel much more informed about the origins and content of the Bible.
5,"Excellent, Thorough & In-Depth Companion to the Video Series","I am especially delighted to have found a new copy of this now out of print companion book to the video series. It is a nice hardback book with multiple color plates and running commentary on how we got our English (and other modern world language translations as well)Bibles ... and what it cost the dear saints who have preceded us so long ago to get it to the ""common man"".I highly recommend running down a copy of the book to go with the video series of the same name, especially if you have children."
2,dissapointing :( hardly any cards,"Think I should have bought the regular version, this one is lame,you burn right through the cards and all the questions."
5,Fun Game,This was a blast for a bunch of teens hanging out together !!!We have played it on long driving trips. Its a great way to get the family together.
4,N64 controllers by nintendo,"I have had 2 nintendo-made n64 controllers for 2 1/2 years, and they haven't broken down. they're contoured, light, and precise. a year ago, i bought a toys-r-us controller... very bad. the non-nintendo controller broke in 3 weeks..."
1,Poorly Written Story Of Great Martial Artists,"This is a poorly written book about two great martial artists. I've been a martial artist and a Bruce Lee fan for over 30 years and have read many books and magazine articles about the legendary martial artist, and have to say this book has been a great disappointment. The book is slow and boring and I would not recommend it to anyone. Better to read one of Jesse Glover's, Dan Inosanto's, or John R. Little's books on the subject."
3,part 2 needs a real author,"this is a book that has been needed for a long time now. the early bruce, and a look back at how he developed. there's great stuff here...too bad it reads like a ""junior scholastic"" teen book! the authors are poor storytellers. this is bruce lee material we have all been waiting for, james yimm lee, jesse glover, wally jay, etc. the early years! fantastic! some great photos...and some not so great maps, copied from ""mapquest""? the book reads like a danielle steel movie-of-the-week potboiler...boring. fantastic material, horrible presentation. like a 5-star meal on a paper plate. bruce and james history both deserve a better treatment...5 star material served as 2 star writing! poor publishing from a company that usually puts out quality books. found quite a few grammatical mistakes...so o.k. get a real writer and a proofreader too! maybe they will make-up for it with volume 2."
5,the absolute best dark brown sugar!,"I have used Billington's molasses brown sugar for many years, it remains my favorite. Perfect in bran muffins and oatmeal cookies or anywhere you want a little richness in the sweetener."
5,Excellent quality and great price,"Excellent sugar, the taste of Molasses is strong and exotic. It comes with an excellent price too. Strongly recommend it!"
1,Sugar dried out and hard,"Unfortunately, when my sugar arrived each package felt as hard as a brick. I opened one package and had to chip at it to obtain a few crumbs of sugar. This is the first item ordered that I have had a problem with. I emailed Amazon customer service, and they promptly sent a refund. Thank you to Amazon for great customer service."
1,Hard as a rock,"My sugar arrived just fine, but when i opened a box i found the sugar to be literally as hard as a rock and not usuable. Yes, i know i can put a moist cloth over the top, try microwaving, blah blah blah but my time is way more valuable that than. the light brown sugar i ordered was fine, and the dark brown i ordered from another manufacturer was great. so word to the wise, you get what you pay for and i can't recommend this product (I threw mine out)."
5,You'll be spoiled forever,"If you are going to go to the trouble to bake something that requires brown sugar, do yourself a favor (it may actually not be a favor, now that I think of it) and try this sugar instead. It is (naturally) more expensive, but the results will justify the expense. This is a moist, rich sugar with strong molasses flavor. It will spoil you forever.I am accustomed to spending $3.00+ for this, so if you bake with any regularity, splurge on this package, store it tightly sealed in a cool place (not refrigerated) and enjoy it. In molasses cookies, this is unparalleled."
4,Molasses sugar,"It is what it says - molasses sugar. To me it tastes more like molasses than brown sugar, which I suppose is a good thing if one happens to like the taste of molasses. The label says ""NATURAL Dark Brown Molasses Sugar"" and it is indeed a very dark brown, much darker than the C&H; ""dark brown"" I am used to, but it would be a mistake to expect this sugar to taste like regular brown sugar only more so. Rather, it tastes much like molasses, perhaps with a hint of a brown sugar undertone. Not what I yearn to put on my oatmeal in the morning, but I AM fond of molasses cookies as I recall - guess I need to dig out my wife's recipe.The 10 1-Lb packages were nicely packed, the sugar inside each 1-Lb box wrapped in plastic film rather than wax paper. The shipment arrived in only a couple of days even though I selected the free super-saver shipping."
4,tv cart,This item came very quickly & was very easy to put together. the only drawback I could see is it isn't made to fit into a corner as I expected.
3,Reasonably Good,"Dead Line is a decent novel. It is not great and not very original.The hero in this book is a reporter, Jack Flynn. He is not a particularly credible hero who is in a story that is pretty much run of the mill.I bought this in a bargain book bin, for which I was thankful. I would not have been too happy had I paid full price for this hardback. It is much more suited to pick up as a used paperback.Mr. McGrory is clearly a good writer. The book is well written; it is just not particularly interesting or exciting. Although billed as a thriller, I would say that description is overly generous.If you are interested in a fast paced, exciting novel, I would not recommend putting this book at the top of your list."
4,The Colonial Experience,"The dynamic of the colonial experience that includes settlers, indigenous cultures, and religion is a fascinating mix. This book is memorable for its language and its symbolism -- it is a tremendous work from the continent."
5,Houseboy-Paper back school novel,"Bought the book Monday night, got it here by Friday. Incredible fast shipping and much appreciated! Thanks!"
2,It would be a great wrist rest if...,"...it hadn't started popping open at the seams about 1 week after I got it. Inside, there's icky gooey stuff that spills out. I ducktaped the opening shut, and that did it for a while, but now other parts of the wrist rest are tearing open, so I guess I'll just get a new one. I really didn't use this wrist rest very heavily and I'm surprised and disappointed it fell apart this quickly without heavy use."
2,Very poorly made,"I put in a lot of hours in front of my keyboard and a wrist rest is an absolute necessity.This is one of the worst wrist rests I've ever used. It only lasted 3 months before I had to buy a replacement.Almost immediately, the wrist rest deformed in the area where I regularly put my wrists, making the rest rather uncomfortable.After just a couple of months, the wrist rest's seams came open and the gel goo started coming out."
2,Very Poor Construction,"Received this product November 28. Today there is a 3"" split in the seam with sticky goo oozing out of it. Permanent adhesive doesn't repair the split seam. Your money would be better spent on another item."
1,the display image is wrong for this item,The image showing for this spoon set is not correct. The image is for Bendable Spoon which used to feed the baby before 12 month old and the description for the image is for baby after 12 month old. When you place the order they send you the set of spoon and fork with metal end for feeding the toddler not the plastic one for feeding the infant.
5,Problem Solver!!,We love the bendable spoon! We bent the spoon and told our daughter to look the dinosaur in the eyes when she took her bites and she was able to spoon feed perfectly.
4,slipping,"I have been a big Stephan Micus fan for quite a few years, but I have to think that his last three CDs show signs his musical inventiveness is progressively slipping. This latest effort retains his honest, commercialism-be-damned approach--for which he should continue to be congratulated--but not very much in the way of listenable musicality. Honesty and spirit are one thing, but entertainment, even in honest and spiritual terms, is another. Here, the koan has taken center stage, in my opinion at the expense of the music(al entertainment). I hate to criticize the plan, but perhaps the first, rather long, narration should have been stretched longer yet to embrace the entire koan (to twenty plus minutes, that is), leaving the rest of the program open to material of greater accessibility. I'm afraid I can only take so much in the way of Zen chants, and I have never considered Micus' vocal powers one of his greatest assets to begin with."
3,A spiritual rather than musical attempt,"Micus has always been a genre of his own, representing a unique way of musical expression in an otherwise musically dry 20th century. He dares to explore equipped with his vast knowledge of instruments and his never ending spiritual wandering. All these are more than enough to place him among the most important modern musical figures.Nevertheless, I tend to believe that his last work crossed a certain threshold: The spirit dominated senses. He uses (or rather, exploits) music to convey his spiritual and rather esoteric message. It would have been quite acceptable should we were talking about a purely religious effort, or about something more inspired like his ""Athos"" work. But Micus stands for more than this.I hope that soon we will be back experiencing the sheer magnificence of works like ""Towards the Wind"", ""East of the Night"" or ""Wings over Water"""
1,This book was terrible!,This book was awful! I mean come on! I'm 16 and I love TBs! I have one of my own and it took me 1 year just to get him to canter under control! No way she could ride for 6 months and be galloping him under control!And come on! Why does every one of Cindy's horses turn out to be a champion?! it does not happen like that! I can't believe Mike actually bought Glory! Glory bothers me. He's doesn't act like a typical TB! Mine was raced and he is still hyper even after we gelded him and got him off the track! I hate to think of what he was like as a stud on the track!
4,Save Thoroughbred!,"The Cindy and second generation eventing portions of the series were dark days for Thoroughbred. The plots have since switched back to racing and the newest few books have been exceptional. Just as we thought there was hope for the Thoroughbred series to be restored to its former glory Harper Collins has decided to end the series abruptly after #72. With such a dedicated following and online fan base with members from all over the world, this is a classic and beloved series that has inspired many people and provided horse fans with vicarious thrills and adventure. Ashleigh saved Wonder, now it's up to you to help save Thoroughbred. [...]"
5,Great book,The book was great. I cried in parts(I get very immotional). But something else. They've written Super Editons about Ashleigh and Samantha. So why not Cindy? They should write about what it was like for her when she was old enough to understand her parents death and how she escaped the orphanage. Just a suggestion.
4,SKYE NEEDS TO WORK ON STRENGTHENING HER BACKBONE...,"I found this book better than the one before (Murder of a Small-Town Honey), but Skye is so spineless at times that it is embarrassing. Come on, she didn't even struggle while being kidnapped by her ""loved ones."" It doesn't compute with her profession. That aside, the story is a fun quick read about her wacky killer family."
2,"5-star movie, 2 stars for not being in its entirety","The 2-star rating that I gave is strictly for how this Amazon Unbox rental ends abruptly at 86:36. Yes the product description says the movie is 87 minutes long so they concur - however, the movie is NOT over yet. Brilliant first movie by the Hui brothers, but you will not get the big payoff or an ending by watching this Unbox Rental.Still, given that currently (July 2007) this movie has been out-of-print in either DVD or VCD format (I've searched all Asian online retailers), 87 minutes is better than zero minutes.If you can wait, buy this movie in hard copy once it becomes available again."
1,Awful,"This goal served me well at first - it was easy to set up and put away, and I was really happy to have my own goal so I could shoot when I wanted. Then the pipes started to break. I'm no Paul Rabil-I don't shoot faster than 75-80 mph with any regularity, but my goal is now broken in 3 different places, from separate shots. The pipes are completely snapped, and the goal now collapses in on itself when I try to carry it or set it up. It's unstable and falls over easily from wind or shots once I finally get it set up, and due to the broken base, the net is now inside the main pipes, leaving gaping holes (the black ties can't hold it up on their own). If you want to shoot with any speed, either this goal is not for you, or be careful to avoid the pipes."
5,If you are in Al Anon...,"You know you should be reading Al Anon literature every day, and having a nice little reader like this is just what you need. Now, whether this is the one you will want is another question. It was ""the original,"" and may seem a little old fashioned, even sexist in places. There are other readers now, and I personally use this one plus Courage to Change. They blend well together, and keep the ideas of Al Anon before me every day.One great thing about almost all Al Anon literature is that you can look up your problem in the index and find something to help.I'd buy this book if I were you. Even if you are not sure Al Anon is for you, this could help you decide."
3,Packaging,"I'm not trying to say the product didn't, work or don't work because I didn't use them yet. But the way it was shipped to me made me afraid to use the product. It arrived quickly that deserved a star, packaging was neat and clean that deserved a star, quantity for a good price that deserved a star. The reason why I didn't give it the last two stars was because like all condoms you purchase are factory sealed, in this case these condoms were covered with a thin sheet of paper and sealed in an easy to open zip lock bag. Making me skeptical about using them. When you go to you local pharmacy and buy condoms and you open the box and you saw that all your condoms were individually sealed in a zip lock bag would you honestly use them or take them back because you thought they was defective? Just my opinion."
1,condoms in ziplock bags,"trying this swinggers thing out and won't go down on any new partners bare so i brought these cause they were a fair price but WHO THE HELL!!!!!!!!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ sells condoms in zip lock bags wanted to use them but can't trust that really shouldve took ""itchyazz"" advice"
4,Latex,"This item was not what I really expected at all. However, not the compaines fault just didn't realize that it would take away totally from the purpose."
5,Music that captures emotions,"I have to say I really enjoy Les Nubians,and their style of singing. The style brings it all the way back to Billie Holiday and the jazz age. The girls also seem to capture the essence of the whole African experiance as well. I noticed that their logo is that of a scarb beeatle,which is a sacred sighn to the Nubians and Ancient Egyptains. The other tracks like makeda tell the story about the black queen of Yemen known as Sheba. The favoriet track of mine is the Princess Nubieans. The vocals on that track is wonderful and also matches the production. The two singers hail from Cameroon and one I think is the result of a interracial couple,not that matters. There is one thing for sure these two women can sing their heart out and produce such a soulful album. The quality matched in this album is quite rare these days. Most singers don't have half the soul these two women have. Hopefully more will learn from them,and stop it already with the cheap bubble gum crap ."
1,Don't buy this book!.....,"I should have known better than to buy this book since it had very few stars to recommend it, but I decided to give it a shot andI truly regret buying this book!..A bit over 105 pages of VERY LITTLE information. What a ripoff!.... what surprised me is that when I asked for my money back,the dealer said: "" I don't do refunds!""...so, it looks like this book either goes into the trash, or I'll tuck it away in some pile of stuff soas not to remind me of what a jerk I was to buy it!..But, something good did come out of this disatrous purchase and that was: NEVER buy from any of Amazons ""sub dealers"" because Amazongives you no guarantee of any refunds when you don't buy from Amazon themselves...And, I see that there were also five, 5 star ratings from people who had purchased this feeble book. That sounds a bit suspicious to me!..Okay, I only hope that this lousy review will convince those interested, NOT TO BUY this terrible book!..."
1,Not worth the money,"This book illustrates photographic special effects that are sophomoric and aesthetically unappealing. It does not cater to the serious photographer, and it is poorly produced with mediocre photographic examples. After reviewing this book, I found it of no use and returned it."
5,a nice wrap up to the new tenchi series,"Ok, a lot of people don't like Tenchi in Tokyo (Shin Tenchi for you die hard otaku out there) and I can see why. It IS different tenchi fare) I however was one of the few who really enjoyed the story If you have liked the series so far you will LOVE the ending because everything finally comes together and you get to see who sakuya REALLY is. ^_^"
4,It's Tenchi... but that;s about it,"the only reasons I can give this DVD 4stars is 1) Ryoko basically gets TEnchi in the end. 2)the shocking way Yugi is fought. 3) it's a Tenchi DVD, and in my opinion that's about as good as it gets.Sadly, TEnchi in Tokyo, Shin Tenchi to some, isn't that great a series, but the plots are well thought out, even if the animation is lacking. IF you want good Tenchi DVD's check out the Tenchi Muyo OVA, that is the best of the best. This series is okay, but never will be as great as the original."
3,Original Imperial performances on this Japanese pressing,"This is a Japanese CD pressing with a price to match. It is well recorded and has great monaural sound. I bought it for the versions of 'Funny How Time Slips Away', and 'Sitting In the Park'. Along with these titles I wanted 'Ride Your Pony', 'See Saw' and 'My Girl'. I have the original U. S. Imperial LPs that contain some of these tunes, but I wanted a good CD version. I give it only three stars because the rest of the CD has mediocre tunes performed by Mr. Fame. I'd recommend '20 Beat Classics' as a starter CD for a new fan of Georgie Fame."
5,Amelia's War the best book,Well i am only 13 and i fell in love with this book i teaches you about what happen in Gettysburg and what the people who lived there had to go thougt so i think you should read it and i hope you do
1,This is not a foot valve; it is a pressure gage,You should correct this; it is not a foot valve. It is a pressure gage.
5,Eau de Toilette,I received the perfume as expected. The price is the best I could find. This is Eau de Toilette not to be confused with Eau de Parfum.
5,So glad I found this again,"I first bought this perfume in Frankfurt Germany when I was a flight attendant and when it finished and we stopped flying to Frankfurt I was without it for so many years. Well I am trilled to have found it here and still LOVE it , my youngest daughter smelt me and said she remembers when I used to smell like that. Will buy more when it runs out."
5,A fine visual survey of American religious architecture.,"This book provides a very helpful classification guide to the many architectural styles employed by Christians and Jews in the United States.There are LOTS of very helpful photographs. The photographs come from throughout the country, but several geographical clusters are evident among them, New England.I don't know of a better book for identifying the styles or getting a sense of the architectural diversity of American churches."
5,The ultimate Bowie album you don't know,"I can't imagine a TRUE Bowie fan not owning this album. Peter Noone (Herman's Hermits) ""Oh You Pretty Thing"" is superb and the one and only Billy Fury doing a rare recording of Bowie's ""Silly Boy Blue"" is simply great. Maybe this is a guilty pleasure, but it is another side of the Bowie coin - and come on it even has John Cougar Mellencamp doing ""The man who sold the world."" And Lulu's version is total fab as well."
4,Glad I bought it...,"I'm always wary about compilations, but I always buy them and am let down. However, I really enjoyed this! I thought the Peter Noone track was great, the Lulu's were great...the first few were hokey, but funny. The only tracks I didn't like were by Astro-something and John Couger Mellancamp's Man Who Sold the World. I LOVE ""Andy Warhol"" and I finally have the Mott the Hoople cover of ""All The Young Dudes"". Good buy."
2,Not very durable,I bought this for my 12 year old granddaughter for her birthday. The carrying case fell apart almost immediately upon opening. Definitely not worth the value.
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun!","This is a great maze book for kids, especially kids who love mummies! It is not too hard or too easy. It is just right!"
1,"Sorry, it was just bad !","I'm sorry , this was just a very mediocre book at best. No characters were likable or could evenbe identified with. Read Alan Paton to get a better insight on Africa at that time.A very laborious, unenjoyable read."
2,"OK, but doesn't answer the Qs","I agree with most of the other reviews here. This book does a fairly good job of distinguishing the differences between factions of Amish and Mennonites, but as far as answering the ""20 Most Asked Questions,"" the answers provided are either very shallow or the question is not answered at all in favor of the authors' own philosophical ramblings. Point in case, Chapter 4, Why Don't They Accept Modern Things? Instead of attempting a response, the authors answer with their own question: are we living a ""modern"" lifestyle that much better off? I suspect they didn't answer this question because doing so would have highlighted the many inconsistencies in the choices made of what technology to accept and what to decline using. The authors should have dealt with these inconsistencies honestly instead of ignoring them. Their shallow treatment of many of the other topics seems to indicate a lack of specific knowledge, or reluctance to talk honestly about them."
2,Take A Good Look,Take a good look at them. Anabaptist means rebaptizer. They were accused of being freeloaders on society.
3,meets the initial expectation,"This blanket is very light and does what it is supposed to do: creating a pseudo ironing board. But for some reason, I found the corner of the white surface turning yellow after the 1st time use. I haven't figured out why yet. But that doesn't seem to affect anything. After my second time use of this product, I wished it could have been bigger. Also, since it does not have an edge (like regular ironing boards do), it's hard to iron shirt cuffs, near the collar, etc. But asides that, I'm pretty satisfied with the product as it is light, foldable, and does not damage the table."
2,Not Satisfied,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase. It is not even worth the money it would take to return it! It is ""bunched"" up around all the edges and doesn't lay flat for ironing. Very lightweight and cheap. I would not recommend it for purchase."
2,Ironing pad,"I was disappointed in this product. the reason for purchasing it was that a friend had one on her dryer and was able to iron things quickly without pulling out an ironing board. she said she purchased it from Amazon and gave me the link. well, hers has magnets so it stays in place, this one doesn't so it doesn't work as well."
4,Make your own oversized ironing board,6 of these plus cotton quilt batting and waterproof outdoor fabric and you can make yourself an oversized ironing board to iron quilts on.
3,Great Finishing,"I believe the uniqueness of the screw pattern for this product. The gold color still remain like new. Good material.Bottom side, the opener need more quality finising"
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered a black Nintendo 64 controller and got a clear nintendo 64 shark controller like the one I was trying to replace because these are horrible. When I called the company they did not seem to know what they were doing and told me to read the product decription carfully because they havent had black controllers for a while. According to the site they have them and have very recent reviews from people who received them! I don't know what to think bad management?
4,Provocative,"This novel is provocative and compelling. You certainly do have to pay attention and follow as you go along, but if you hold the threads together on your own throughout, you will find that the author weaves them together in the end. I think the author was going for a provocative statement that challenges the reader to analyze the characters and fill in his or her own projections as to why the characters are as they are. Their development is not spoon fed, but is hinted at and suggested. By not truly revealing the protagonist until the end of the book, the author forces the reader to evaluate the changes in all of the central characters and ask themselves whether or not they are style changes or substance changes. In the end, the reader has done a good bit of exploring his or her own character as well as the characters on the pages. I think that was the point."
4,SOCOM 3 is awesome,"first thing i would like to say is that SOCOM 3 is a lot different than SOCOM 2. some of the weapons on SOCOM 2 can be silenced now and all the automatic rifles can have a scope also. the graphics are good overall, i would say SOCOM 2 has better graphics tho. Oh yeah i give this game 4 1/2 stars.THE THING THAT SUCKS: u need a credit card number for your friends list and a clan. if your parents won't let you use your credit card number, there could be a problem.Overall the game is very nice so far. i've only played the game for about 3 or 4 hrs so far, and i haven't tried the single player missions yet. yes, there are 32 players online at once, but 16 on 16 is pretty laggy sometimes. so its better if u do like 10 on 10 or less if u don't want any lag."
5,Hours of enjoyment,"I bought this game for my 10-year-old son as a substitute for Modern Warfare 2. We do not have an X-Box and will not likely get one until Microsoft pulls its collective head out of its rear end and starts making a product that does not break down five times a year. This game has provided hours of enjoyment for my son and myself.I suggest that you become familiar with the weapons and comfortable using them, especially the long and medium scopes, the grenade launchers, the rocket launchers and the flash bangs. Also, learn how to use the other guys on your team. You can have Team Bravo breach doors and toss grenades to take out enemy bots. You can also have them advance ahead of you to get into a good position before you advance and trigger the enemies to come out of the woodwork. Most maps and levels are enjoyable, but the very last one (Brewed Chaos) can be extremely frustrating."
3,"Good game, but enjoyed Socom II better.","Don't get me wrong, I think that Socom III is an excellent game for the Playstation 2. One of the best looking, interactive that I have seen in a long time, but I enjoyed Socom II alot more. I do not care for the large maps. It is not the producers fault, it is the players. Normally it comes down to the last person on the other team, and he or she decides "" I'll camp "". Well that means you have to travel all over the map, normally resulting in not finding the person. If you've been killed by the other team or even by your own team member you have to wait along time. In Socom II maps were small enough that gameplay lasted about 2-3 mins a round. That's my only prob with socom 3 really, besides the fact that you had to enter your credit card to access the ranking. I do not like placing my credit card over the internet.Other then the two things i've stated, Socom III is a really great game if you like army style games with huge maps."
2,Not as Great as Overrated Reviews - Socom II Better,"Socom 3 is the worst of the series. The previous series where more realistic in gameplay while Socom 3 is more arcade like. For example, you and your team is automatically healed at checkpoints on the same mission - how realistic is that? I enjoyed playing Socom 1 with the knowledge all it takes is one shot. I was real frustrated when I played the Socom 3 Poland episode because it was arcade-style like Syphon Filter 1. I cannot stand stealth mission (or earning a driving license) on video games and wish game developers stop putting that in! The vehicles are also unrealistic and totally unneccessary.People claiming this to be the best product ever are questionable at best. I'm a real Socom player and this has got to be the worst they put out in the series."
1,Amazon didn't get my game to me,"Amazon gets the 1 star, not Socom 3. I pre-ordered this game over a month ago. It hasn't even shipped yet. Now Amazon says December 13 for a delivery date. I'm very angry and disappointed, becareful about ording from Amazon. They don't deliver when they say."
5,AMAZON GETS A ZERO FROM ME TO MAN,I pre orderd it to and I got the same shipping date Dec 14 that is not good I agree with you Matt.
3,great game but relax,"The game is great, and I recomend getting it. If you are a novice player, and got frustraited with socom 1&2 you will like this one better. You can now save your progres throughout the game at checkpoints. Although I have to somewhat dissagree with the good reviews that the team AI for this game is getting. Jester or bravo will sometimes run out ahead of you only to messup a mission or get killed. Bravo sometimes will not follow you when you are in seperate atv's. So if they don't just mount everybody into one. I also noticed is is sometimes hard to kill the enemy unless you get a good head shot. Another thing is when you give them a voice command you have to repeat it 2 or 3 times. Overall though I love the game,and suggest buing it. The glitches you have to deal with, and it's not that bad once you get into the game."
3,Socom...please,"This game is not what I expected, it doesn't do much for me and the kids don't even play it anymore. I should have gotten a Dora game or something for my daughter."
1,What a piece of crap !,DON'T BUY IT !!!Socom I & II were the best ever... I mean that... THE BEST... but III is one of the worst games ever... AARRGG ! poor imitators of Valve's Counter Strike(which is bad as well... at least if you are above 12 and like the challenge of THINKING!!!)... its all about mass market.. forget the challenge of the first two games... Socom III is all about running and shooting... Zipper: either you go back to the old (good) formula) or Zip IT to YOU ! Bye-Bye...
1,"THE ONLY GOOD DAY WAS YESTERDAY, when I had my SOCOM 2","THE ONLY GOOD DAY WAS YESTERDAY, before I sold my SOCOM 2 to get this game.The only people who will like this game are unemployed couch potatoes. I tried playing the game and I swear I was sniped 15 seconds into the game, run over by a truck... basically I suck. I didn't buy the game to watch other people play after I get shot in the first minute. But, how do you learn by just watching other people play. The maps are too huge to memorize.The game SUCKs big phat hairy donky Ballz!!!"
1,Horrendous...and not in the way you want it to be...,"Guys, I love horror movies. I'm a fanatic. And with that admission, I have to also add that I love BAD horror movies with as much enthusiasm as the good ones......but not this crap.A nearsighted, intellectually challenged chimpanzee with a 1985-era video camera could have made better films than these with a cast culled from local convenience stores...I hate to be so harsh, but I'm telling you, even with MY penchant for b-grade tripe (LOVE films like ""Pieces"" and ""Seven Doors of Death""), I can't find one single redeeming quality in ANY of the vignettes in this set. The only reason I give it one star is because there is not an option for negative stars.Trust me folks...save your money on this one."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!,"I am a fan of horror movies but these has to be the worst horror movies ever created. Horrible acting(""I Hate your brother!, let's get him""), horrible special effects(The CGI is SO bad that the planets have visible sides, SIDES!!!), horrible directing. AHH!!!! everything about these movies is bad."
1,out dated film,Film date is expired . Quality of pictures were faded . Then again I knew what I was gettig As Kodak dosen't make this product anymore and any left are beyond expiration date . To bad as this is the end of a wonderfull era . All these cameras are now useless . I'll still hold on to mine as a collectors item. Bill from Mass.
3,Adequate,"The film is expired, but it seems to work just fine. Just make sure that your camera requires 1200 film like this because some cameras require 600 or some other type."
3,polaroid spectra film,"Film was ok. Price was terribly high, but I needed the film and I knew the price before ordering. I have since destroyed my camera so I will not be tempted to buy more film"
1,Polaroid Spectra Film,Want to return the three boxes of this film that I purchased. Two of the boxes do not say Spectra on it and I do not trust that the film is good. I have contacted the supplier. We are insisting that the return be processed through Amazon and they are reluctant. They have given me a return postage and I do believe that my girl returned it today. I am trusting that I will receive a full refund either from Amazon or from the supplier.
4,One shot deal,I gave to my dad as a gift since he has a polaroid camera. He needed to take pictures of all his children and grandchildren right away. This was a great deal although a little pricey for my taste.
4,A Retro Treasure,"I found this film on Amazon to be reasonable in price (of course I understand the limited supply drives up the cost), and I know the film is way past its expiration date, so I won't bash this item for not being up to my expectations. The film ended up being kinda yellow-ish green after taking, which as I understand, means that the camera itself or film has been too hot at one point. (Probably the camera I bought at a garage sale) Luckily the film worked with my camera and I now have some great old photos to show off :)Due to the price and practicality, I probably won't buy any more film, but I'm glad I got some, and I probably wouldn't have bought any if not for Amazon."
1,Way too basic and outdated,"I kept the book all of one night before sending it back. The information in the book was way too basic for my taste. If you are familiar with HTML forms at all then this book is not for you. Maybe if you are just starting with the idea of conducting online research then this book would be helpful, but I found it outdated already and somewhat elementary (i.e. a chapter on using search engines)."
3,Recommend Vista Survey over Websurveyor,"I purchased this book and found it overly-basic and frankly a waste of time. Make sure the survey provider you choose offers Correlation analysis, Confidence intervals, and Cumulative distribution are among the various statistical measures used to analyze your results. I found that Vista is the only survey tool gives you all of this crucial information."
5,light and super warm,the boot top are a perfect size for snowboarding. there is no bunching inside of your boot and this pant is super warm when it feels like your wearing nothing at all.
5,You don't have these?!!,"Dude! Quit sticking your long-johns INSIDE your snowboard boots! You're gonna get hot-spots and blisters.These are GREAT! This was my 2nd pair purchased. Now I wear one while the other dries out from the previous day.Always warm, always dry, and super comfortable.What are you THINKING! Buy some."
2,Overpriced undies,"These were warm and toasty...for the few times i was able to wear them. They quickly developed numerous holes even under easy conditions. I've worn them less than 10 days..on a trek in NE India and on work days when temps were under 10F (office work).UPDATE...mebbe I was a little harsh initially, but seeing holes after light usage is still pretty subpar. I added a star. I did just buy 2 more pairs (at just $34 each!) The sizing is off...(small)...they are the ONLY product I've ever had to order in XL (well except for the condoms, heh.) However they still are pretty snug."
1,More info,"I dont know whay they dont add more info....... CrazyHere is more info :Aftermarket Radio to Antenna Adapter for Select 1995-2005 Ford, Lincoln, Mercury VehiclesOnly one star because people have already wated money buying the wrong one due to lack of info"
1,Doesn't fit 2008 Ford Expedition,"Based on the ever so descriptive product specs, I figured I was set for my car's head unit upgrade. Save yourself some time, go to Metra's website and figure out which adapter fits your car before you order.Square peg, round hole. Thanks Amazon for taking it back thought."
5,Working great,"I put this graphics card in my super cheap ""off the shelf"" computer from Sam's Club. I wanted to play ""The Sims 2"" and ""Zoo Tycoon 2"" and it's working great! I think I need a bit more RAM to make the games run a little faster though."
5,Wonderful,"I was looking for a good simple romance story and I found it with this book. It had a little bit of every thing in it. I was sorry to see the end. Like with any book that I really like and enjoy reading, I want it to continue, I don't want it to end. I recommend this book to anyone that wants a nice clean romance."
2,Fantastic,"What a wonderful,spellbinding story full of love,adventure and betrayal. Loved the whole plot,it was a very well put together story. My thanks to the authors :)"
2,"Excellent wrist rest, poor quality","PROS:-The gel is the most comfortable feel I've used.-The nylon material is non-abrasive and comfortable for long periods of use-Wrist rest is heavy and will stay put-Cleaning up the goopy gel that leaks out is sticky, but leaves no residue on fingersCONS:I've gone through 3 of these wrist rests in the last couple of years. The nylon material keeps separating from the base and then the gel is squeezed out onto the keyboard/desk/etc. I've replaced it with a new one when I get tired of cleaning it up. The latest one I bought didn't last more than 5 months before the material separated again. I'll be replacing it with a different brand."
5,"Been using for 3 years, 3M - WR310MB","I was given this wrist rest at work with no other options, after using it I found no need for other options. This is a great gel pad, the material does not stick to you and does not tear or move around like others I've had. The bottom is a non-slip material that stays put, but does not stick to the desk. The size is 19x3x.75 and there is a sticker on the back with the exact model number, WR310MB. After 3 years it still works and looks like new. I like it so much I plan to buy one for home use."
5,Very Fast,"I was skeptical at first that this CompactFlash Card would 'really' be 'high speed', but our own test confirmed that my Canon PowerShot S50 would be ready for the next shot in one second as opposed to the almost 3 seconds we were experiencing with the small card that comes with the camera."
4,I am happy with it!,This is my second baby monitor purchase since my baby (now 15 months) was born. This is an easy to use monitor that displays a clear image of my baby (I can even see if his eyes are open in the dark!). Great buy.
5,See and Hear the Rascals..,Wonderful color during the afternoon naps or early evening sleep time. Extra camera to watch backyard play...when mom or dad are not standing there. Watch the to be three year old learn to crawl out of bed or the crib. I did not expect true night vision but sound is excellent. I purchased with the static suppressor recommended and I have no problems with Wi-Fi or microwave.
2,A great camera system if you have no other wireless devices,"This camera was an additional camera to the SVAT wireless monitoring system:http://www.amazon.com/SVAT-GX5203-Wireless-Portable-Surveillance/dp/B000TG6H6Q/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&s;=electronics&qid;=1234620239&sr;=8-15Once turned on we had great picture from the camera, but all our 2.4Ghz devices simply stopped working.We tried every possible setup - moving routers, phone bases, cameras - nothing helped. It felt like this camera was built as a 2.4Ghz frequency scrambler. We ended up returning this item in exchange for an older, 900Mhz type system that works great - even though a bit static-y at times."
3,Wireless Interference,"Purchased for an additional camera for my system. Camera works fine and I am keeping it. However, I discovered that the camera on some frequencies will override my home computer wireless network. It blocked all signals from wireless equipment. Unplugging camera and switching its frequency will solve the problem."
1,Chuck Smith leader of Calvary Chapel at his best,"Chuck Smith, speculates that Yasser Arafat could be the Antichrist. This book is great because it shows you the roots of Calvary Chapel and the crazy end times stuff and how it changes over the years. A must read for every Calvary Chapel attendee."
2,Game is okay,"Bad Graghics, The rides go down a big drop, but they don't go fast up the next hill? Roller coaster tycoon is ALOT better."
3,Sim Theme Park,"There isn't much I can say about this game. You build a park for people and that is really it. I mean this game is actually kind of fun. I mean making a Theme Park doesn't sound like much fun but it kind of is. But the bad thing about this game is that it is kind of hard because you have a limit amount of money, your workers go on strike and when your workers go on strike your rides blow up and other things like that. If you use a cheat though this game is fun because then you can buy all the stuff you want to. But then again like all games this game does get old after a while"
1,BORING!!!,"I hate this game, it's so boring! All you have to do is build your own Theme Parks, sure, you get to ride the rides, but, there not very graphic. ..."
1,Too easy to play...too easy to get annoyed with.,"I found this game fun for about five minutes. Then the little helper guy just got annoying. There's no challenge to a game when you are told what to do constantly. After I built three theme parks, I tried to build a fourth, but you have to delete one so only three are open. I decided the game was too frustrating and gave up."
4,Sim Theme Park is fun but...,I think Sim Theme Park is fun but there is this thing that always popping up and telling you something you don't realy care about.Other than that if you like sim games buy this one.
4,Easy To Get Into And A Challenge,"Sim Theme Park is a fantsatic game with so many different possibilities. There are four different themes to choose from (space Zone, Land Of Wonders, Halloween and The Lost Kingdom) where you get to decide what rides you want and you even get to ride on them. As well as choosing what rides you want in your park you also get to choose what shops you want in your park. This is a great game and you will get so much gameplay out of it, so its great value for money"
4,"OK, but not the best graphics.","Graphics- 2.5 stars (but what can you expect in PLaystation 1 ?)Fun- 4 starsease of use- 3.5Controls-4.5Overall- about 3.7 which rounds off to 4!This game is pretty fun, but the graphics arent too great, but what can you realy expect from a Playstaion 1 game? One thing that did get on my nerves was the little ant that would pop up and give you 'hints' about the game. Sometimes, while he was talking you just had to listen and could not continue playing. He popped up AAAALLLLLLL the time. It can be hard to build a custom rollercoaster, especially when you have to connect the last piece to the building its hard to get it positioned just right. But I would say overall- THIS IS A DECENT GAME AND I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING IT FOR YOUR COMPUTER OR PS2 INSTEAD BECAUSE OF THE GRAPHICS BUT IF YOU DONT HAVE A PS2 THAN THATS OK JUST GET THIS ANYHOW."
3,"its okay, nothing like the pc version","it being nothing like the pc version, to me, was the fun factor. The menus are confusion (you got to go up to go down sort of deal). oddly, there's rides and sideshows in this game that don't exist in the pc version--not even the expansion!!! I don't know, this version of sim theme park was just too... different, not fun. I didn't think it was fun--you other buyers might find it fun. I think it was just the menus that spoiled it for me. First you hit (if i remember right) the triangle button, it'd bring up a long list of options. You click on one option to bring up another long list of sub-options. Then hit it again to bring up 3 or 4 more options that'd have something to do with the object you want to edit or something like that. I bought this game a month ago so i'm a bit rusty on WHY i didn't care as much for it as the pc version. I think that's the basics of it."
2,Repetative,Its basically the same game over and over. I played it for 3 days and it was already too easy! Don't waste your money!
4,This game is pretty good...,"This game is great but it's a little difficult to get used to the controls. Once u are used to the computer version it's hard to find everything on the Playstation version. It's challenging and it kept me busy for weeks. The advisor guy gets annoying after a while but he's not too annoying. You can wander around your park but u have to buy a camcorder first. You can still ride your rides on here and there's nothing different about that. I'm not saying this is a bad game, it's really great in fact, but some things get annoying after a while."
4,Wonderful,"I played this on my friend's playstation, and It is awesome! I loved it. I feel that it is better then the PC version of this game because in the PC version, you can't actually walk around the park like you can in the playstation version.Another great thing about this game is that it is different. You don't go around killing people in a blood bath. My mom is always complaining about those type of games. Anyway, this is a must have for any gamer out there!"
2,"Low graphics, hard to do","I loved the Sim Theme Park game on PC, and when my brother got a PS1 for his birthday I went right out and bought the Sim Theme Park for Playstation1. Well, I was dissapointed. The graphics have been reduced greatly. It is also difficult to create a park (in my opinion), and the it takes a while for our version to load. However, there may be a scratch or so on it, since I did get it used (I am cheap lol). However, most Playstation 1 games have lower graphics so, it isn't that bad. But honestly, I like the PC version much better than the PS1 version.Pros:1) Fun creating your own theme park2) The great PC game comes to PS1!Cons:1) PC version better2) Low graphics3) Controls are difficult"
3,SIM Theme Park fell flat,"I had the PC version first and was very disappointed with this version. AFter you get the park set up and pass the first 3 challenges, there are no more challenges for you to meet which was a huge part of the PC version. I actually left the game running and left the room for 3 hours after setting up a park, and I had made $100,000 and everyone was happy.I guess the trick to this game is to not play it."
3,The stuggles and hardships students face during school.,"I think that the book just shows through many examples how Americas educational system is. The way that some students get over looked, are stuck in ""remedial"" and are unable to get out. Some students give up because they feel if they are in remedial classes why try."
5,Good read,Read this for a college class and was pleasantly surprised at how I actually liked the book. It really walked you through the life of an inner city teacher and the struggles they face. Highly recommend for anyone going in to teaching.
3,A personal account...with flaws,"Though the writing is solid and to the point, the story line of Mike Rose tends to come off as preachy. With a moving account of his educational background, the reader is often drawn to feel sympathy towards his cause. As an educator, it is useful book to read for the perspective, but that is about it. The account is extremely one-sided and doesn't take into account many challenges facing America's educationally underprepared. If you're looking for an easy read with some substance, this a good book. If you're looking for something trying to tackle social issues, keep looking."
4,Lives on the Boundary,The book was in very good condition and didn't have nothing wrong with it. The shipping didn't take long at all which I was really glad because I ordered it not even a week before school started.
4,A must read for educators,A wonderful text that gives voice to those adolescents who too often fall through the cracks of our educational system. A must read for educators and administrators who want to better understand the diverse realities that students bring to the classroom.
2,A lame substitute,"Well, after owning this for 5 years and using it as a backup only, I'd say its worth what you pay for it - less shipping. I bought it from ""Amazon.com LLC"" - supposedly the best source. It never had much capacity even when new, but it was so much less than the genuine Canon that it had its place - as an emergency only battery. Now, it won't hold a charge and the original Canon battery is still kicking. Consider these limitations if you buy one, just don't think its anywhere the equal of the original."
3,Does not hold charge well,"I purchased this as back up battery to my Canon compact camera due to its low price when compared to original Canon brand battery. I also found out you get what you paid for; in other word, it didn't hold charge well at all. Yes, I can use it to take photos but invariably, I ended up swapping the battery at least twice at any given time taking travel photos. The original? Only once.Do not purchase this battery if you're expecting that you can shoot equal amounts of photo compared to original battery."
2,Good first charge,"My battery will run out much faster than my old canon battery after the first month.... now after 3 months it's not even worth to charge it....I can normaly take 5 pictures with a full charge of this battery.... No intence use at all...just on weekends, barelly"
4,Works just as well as OEM,"I have a Canon TX1 hybrid camcorder plus digital camera (720p video, 7.1 MP camera). Taking video with this thing eats battery. I bought 4 of these (which equals the price of the the OEM Canon battery). After 4 months of use, 2 of the batteries lost ability to hold much charge. After 6 months, the other two lost the ability to hold charge. I suppose that, for the price of 1/4 the OEM battery, this is fine, but it can be quite annoying. The OEM battery, meanwhile, is still soldering on like a champ."
1,Stay away - no good,"The battery fits, charges etc., no problem. It claims a higher capacity than the original Canon battery, but I assure you that's not the case. Stay away from this garbage and by an original Canon batt - that's my advice anyway."
1,"This is not a good product, buy a different brand.","Bought this along with a new Canon SD1100 IS camera. The factory battery works well. The camera will not even power on with the CTA battery , even though it was properly charged. Returning it to buy a Canon battery."
2,Good for a while; then rotten for the rest of the time.,"I bought the CTA Digital DB-NB4L Replacement Battery at the same time that I purchased my Canon PowerShot SD1000 with its original OEM NB-4L battery. For about one year, the CTA Digital DB-NB4L held a fair amount of charge and I could use it for about 1/2 the photo shots that I could with the Canon OEM NB-4L battery. After a year and a half of using both batteries on a constant basis, the Canon OEM battery allows me to take about 400 pictures before it needs a recharge. However, the CTA DB-NB4L Replacement Battery only allows me to take about 18 to 24 pictures before it needs a recharge. The CTA Digital DB-NB4L Replacement Battery is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. I am going back to buying a Canon OEM NB-4L battery. I'll be using the CTA battery as a small paperweight."
4,NB4L review,For the price the battery is a good backup for Canon made battery. Would buy this battery again.
2,Battery Life short,After charging this battery and using it I found that the battery that came with the camera lasted much longer. This could be a fluke but I am not too pleased with its performance.
1,Battery - DOA,"When I received this battery I immediately tried to charge it as recommended by the manufacturer. However, when I did so, the charger's light did not illuminate. I checked the charger, I checked the contacts, all seemed to be fine, but still it wouldn't cause the charger light to illuminate. I placed it in the charger for 5 hours and then checked the output voltage of the battery - only 0.8 volts. My original battery charges in just a couple of hours, no problem. Clearly this new one is a defective battery. Too bad they don't check these things at the factory."
1,Why bother at any price? Doesn't hold charge,"This battery was purchased as a backup for the original factory supplied Canon battery. Even for the small price I paid, it wasn't worth it. The battery can barely hold a charge and is done after 10 to 20 pictures. Invest your money in something that will work, get a Canon original."
3,took it s time to have full capacity,battery is ok but the first 3 times it was empty after around 15 minutes of camera operation. apparently the battery need some charge circles to establish full capacity because now it works as expected
1,The battery sent do not fit in the camera,I asked for Cannon Battery Pack NB-5L - 3.7V 1120 mAh(Li-ion) and received NB-4L - 3.7V 1400 mAh(Li-ion)I can't used it.I am asking for the correct replacement or reimburse my money.Thank you
4,Extra battery for a Canon SD1000,I bought 2 of these. Both are indistinguishable from the OEM battery. Good value and product.
1,DOA battery,"I charged this battery for 10 hours after receiving it, but the first time I tried to use it, it only lasted for 30 minutes. It has decreased since then and now only last for about 10 minutes of shooting time. I've had it a month now and just tossed it in the local Best Buy recycle bin.Emails to the company selling it were never responded to."
1,Completely Fails as a Replacement Battery,"I ordered two of these as back-ups for my Canon Powershot SD750 and they're complete crap. The instant I took them out of the package I was worried because they were so light in comparison to the original battery that came with the camera and unfortunately my worries were well-founded.The life on these batteries is utterly feeble - I'd estimate it to be less than 50% of what a standard brand-name battery would be. Worst of all, they appear to lose their charge over time when unused - so I've had occasions where I've reached for them as the back-up only to find that they're virtually dead.I tried everything I knew of to boost the performance from trying to 'reset' the memory of the battery by draining it completely, to leaving them in the charger for 36 hours and nothing has worked.You get what you pay for with these - better to invest a few more dollars and get a battery that actually works."
4,Good replacement but not as good as original,"I bought this battery as a backup for a trip to Disney World. The original battery lasted several days without needing a recharge while this one only lasted about a day and a half. It works well, just doesn't last as long as the Canon battery that came with the camera."
1,Doesn't last as long as the original Canon battery.,I don't remember how much I paid for the CTA brand battery. I bought this as a spare battery. The original Canon battery is still going strong. I've had camera for about five years and this particular battery stopped holding charge after 2.5 years.
5,Great little back up battery,"This battery for my Cannon camera is a great little ""back up"" battery. My camera came with a Cannon battery and charging unit. The replacement Cannon battery sells for over $40.00 so purchasing this CTA battery at less than $10.00 is a very good choice."
5,Excellent buy,Good to have a backup battery available. Used it after other battery ran out of power when away from recharger.
1,Beware Cheap Off-Brand Batteries,"I purchased (3) CTA Brand ""NB-4L"" batteries about a year ago for a Canon Powershot SD630 camera. The CTA batteries seemed as good as my original Canon-brand battery at first. After about 10 or so uses and recharging cycles of the CTA battery, it began to hold less and less of a charge. All three reacted the same way. Now after a year of occasional use (maybe one recharging cycle per month on average), they now only hold enough charge for about 10 pictures on a ""full-charge"" while my original Canon-brand battery is still performing well. I don't know if this is a problem of the CTA brand, or of replacement off-brands in general. Given the cheap prices, I assume they all may perform similarly. I notice that a lot of the 4-star and 5-star reviews posted are posted by people who have just received the batteries and tried them for the first time in prime condition. They are not people who've owned and used them through many recharging cycles."
2,Doesn't work with Canon SD750,"This product was cross merchandised with the Canon SD750, which I own, so I bought an extra battery for my camera. It doesn't fit in it, so I had to return it."
3,Very Happy with Product Shipping sucked,I am extremely happy with the products I purchased. Excellent. I am no happy with the fact the company could not combine shipping so I did not have to pay twice. SHIPPING SUCKS. You would think companies would promote cheaper shipping for buying more than one item.
1,cheap price,"cheap price, but the shipping cost is high comparing the price of the item. I bought two batteries, but I was asked to pay twice the shipping cost, which doubled my buying price."
3,Cannon replacement Battery,This CTA replacement Battery for the Cannon compact cameras appears to be just as good as the Cannon Battery & at far less the cost. The charge last just as long as the Cannon Battery & the Physical outside looks just as good. My only problem with this Battery is the high shipping cost which appears to make up for the low published cost of the item. This is the case for a lot of items sold through the internet.LATERAfter using for sometime I will say that this battery isn't as good as ariginal & doesn't hold charge near as long.Break the bank & buy a Canon Battery.
2,Must be aware of when these were charged,"These never work as well as the Canon brand battery that came with the camera.They were pretty good when I first bought them, but they are very low quality batteries and don't have good capacity after a few months.If these were charged recently, they will work pretty well.If it has been 2 weeks or more since they have been charged, they will only take a few pictures before running out of juice.So, basically, you have to be sure they're charged close to the time you'll use them to get them to hold any charge."
1,Doesn't last...,"Bought this product 9/27/2007 (about 1 month after buying the camera) and it no longer holds a charge... Takes about 5 pictures on a full charge... Yet, the orginal Canon battery continues to take hundreds of pictures... Thus, the only argument here is that you can buy a new 'cheap' battery every six months to get the equivalent life of the OEM battery... Seems like more of a hassle than it's worth..."
3,Great battery but you actually are ordering 2 of them,As the title above states... this is a excellent little battery for your zen micro (at least in my case) but look carefully at the wording.... you're getting a great deal on TWO of them... (which may not be all that great a deal if you only need one of them...Other than that... good buy!
1,Waste of money,Less than 6 months later this battery would no longer hold charge at all. Poor quality. Avoid.
2,Horrible Sound on a Music DVD -- Inexcusable!,"I love the band, so I couldn't wait to get the dvd. After a first viewing, I actually exchanged it thinking that I had a bad copy or something. Then I read the other reviews here that told me I wasn't hearing things with the extremely poor audio quality and metallic ""clipping"". While I love the content and the videos are very cool, this horrendous audio clipping is simply inexcusable with any dvd, especially for a band that uses technology so proficiently in its music. Warner should fix this problem and offer to exchange the bad dvd's ASAP, but of course this will never happen."
3,POOR AUDIO,i returned my first copy of this dvd cause i thought i purchased a bad one. i love the band and the music but c'mon guys for a sonicly perfect band this dvd sucks!!! turn it down and play the cd is my best advise. L8R
1,Horrible self-serving brag video,I guess Richard Patrick's big ego showcased on this video left little room for a decent audio track. The sound quality is almost worst than streaming real audio!
1,Bad BadFilter,"I wanted to buy this DVD very badly because I bought all the domestic/import cd singles featuring videos that have accompanied their CD, TITLE OF RECORD, and am mesmerized by what I've seen/heard. I'm extremely disappointed that the band didn't make sure their DVD's sound quality was up to the high standards(""live"" or studio)as their cd albums before they released this DVD...I will NOT buy it cos of what I've read here...these fans must be telling the truth."
3,Should be better...,"This DVD has some great music, but the sound quality really sucks, which detracts completely from the experience. Also, the title of the DVD is very misleading, since almost all the music comes from their earlier work, not Title of Record. Still, if you're a fan, you're gonna wanna have it."
4,Content is the key.,"Content is the key to this Filter release. A hodge-podge of material (some new, some old) is cut together niceley providing an entertaining hour and a half of Filter madness. I was a little leary of this item as it recycles material from ""Phenomenology"" (which I already own). What I found was that only the ""best-of"" Phenomenology (at least I think) was cut into the DVD, leaving plenty of space for new material. In particular, The ""Electronic Press Kit"" which was very cool, as well as scenes with Rich and Geno hanging out in the desert doing crazy stuff with a convertable mustang. Funny. Worth the money just to see that. It's nice to have a copy of the ""Welcome To The Fold"" video too. I'm curious as to why they included the video for ""One"", and not ""Trip Like I Do"". Other than that, no complaints. The still montage at the end is a little lack-luster, but those things always tend to be a disappointment.Glad to have it in my collection."
3,Can't You Trip Like I do?,"I was very disappointed when this DVD didn't include the video for ""(Can't You) Trip Like I Do."" But it did include ""One,"" which is very cool. Overall the videos are good, especially the live ones. But the audio is HORRIBLE. Didn't Filter watch the video first, before marketing it? You'd think the band would fix it, after they heard how bad it was."
2,Not the real deal,"My grandsons love Disney books. We often read one and then I order the movie.I inadvertently ordered this version of Peter Pan. It is not a delightful asthe original Disney movie. I learned a lesson here. The Disney was more expensive, but worth the difference."
5,Wonderful Rubber!,These tires are real beauties! Smoother and meatier thanmy Murray originals. Makes my ride look even more stylish!Easy change out.........
5,ENTOURAGE FROM A DIFFERENT POV,"This show is over way to fast and is all to real. You want more and more of it. The only thing I don't like about the show is the annoying nerd, but everything else is pitch perfect from the fashions, to the women, to the gritty nature of New York, to the down right cool. If you are not watching this then why not."
5,Enchanting!,"Is it Chick Lit or fantasy? It doesn't really matter, because Enchanted, Inc. is just plain fun to read. I loved the frog kissing and the characters were fun. I can't wait for the sequel."
5,Very Fun Read!!,"I have to admit I first picked up this book and dropped it again after a few chapters...but I picked it up again and pushed through the first couple chapters and the book is wonderful!! Its funny in the right places, with a little suspense thrown in here and there, now add in some possible love interests and its perfect!! I loved it, and as soon as I finish I will be ordering the last 3 books right away!!"
4,More please!,This is the first in a 4 book series about a woman who is immune to magic. One day she sees all sorts of strange things and gets invited to join a company that is trying to keep magic users only doing good magic. The head of the company is Merlin from King Arthur's time. They need her to spot when someone is trying to pull a fast one. Keeping the secrets about the place she works is hard.
5,Page Turner,"This is one of the cutest stories I have read. It is definately a page turner. It is full of suspense, action, romance, and a fairy tale all wrapped together. I read this book within 3 days. I really hope the series continues because it is such an ENCHANTING book! I am definately addicted to this series."
5,Excellent and funny,"I just loved this book! It was well written (which is not the case with all books in this genre) and involving and most importantly to me, amusing. A young woman with no magical ability and a lot of common sense goes to work for Magic Inc. and becomes the glue that holds this wild and wooly place together. Romance is trying to happen but not running smoothly thanks to gargoyles and such. I've ordered all in this series I can find. So much fun."
4,Prepared to be Charmed,"Ms. Swendson has done a phenomenal job with this work of comedy/romance piece of art. This book is a sure fire success with any woman who has at one time or another worked for a boss you wish you could curse. And if you have ever dated someone and wondered if you might have been better off to have just kissed a frog, you won't want to miss this book. I am on the edge of my seat, waiting for the next book!"
5,Adorable,I loved this book! I am from the Buffy/Angel generation and of course the Harry Potter adults fan club and I loved this book! I would love to get a job at MSI!
3,Not to Bad,"This book was a cute little story but I didn't find the characters very engaging. While I finished the story - I didn't really care about how it ended. The main character was written a little too weakly and the ""hero"" was oddly ambivalent."
4,"Enchanted, Inc.",This is a great easy read. The story was fun and magical. THis would be great to take to the beach.
2,"Good plot, Poor execution","I was excited to read this story, the promo sounded fun and unusual. I was disappointed. The storyline is a fanciful, untypical, magical idea. Unfortunately, it wasn't told well. I couldn't bring myself the finish the book. It was very weak in character and scene development. The dialog was not interesting or engaging. I decided that it was a waste of my time to read it. I would like to see it re-written with much more creativity put into giving individuality to the characters and liveliness to the story."
5,omg good,My husband and I both love this series. It is unpretentious. It is consuming. Feels like you are right there and part of their magical world. Feels so real. The whole series is worthy of reading and enjoying. Keep writing please!
5,Enchanted,"Enchanted, Inc. is the first book of a series by Shanna Swendson (she also wrote some books as Samantha Carter). It is followed by Once Upon Stilettos, Damsel Under Stress, and Don't Hex With Texas (Coming around January 2008)In this first book Katie Chandler has been living in NY for about a year and finds out that magic is real when she gets a job offer from Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc because of her rare immunity to magic.Enchanted, Inc. is one of my favorite romance novel despite the lack of steamy scenes. If books had a age rating I would rate this book as PG. If you like cute-sy romances like IQ and Kate & Leopold with Meg Ryan or Mrs Winterborne with Ricki Lake/Brendan Frasier, I'd definitely suggest this book for you."
5,Cute and clean,"This is a delightful read from start to finish! The story is completely frothy, but has originality. I love how the magic folks find a totally non-magic person valuable---it's a great twist. The author keeps the tone light and witty, and never delves deeply into the dark side of things. What's more, both the plot and the language are clean enough that I can recommend this book to my teenage niece without worrying whether the content would offend her (or her mother). How refreshing!"
3,"Entertaining, not engaging.","The concept for this book was great! I really wanted more the entire time I was reading though. I kept thinking, oh, what an original idea, let's see where this goes......then nothing happened. I was entertained greatly, however, it was a very quick read, and left me only frustrated."
2,Just Okay.,"I bought this based on the reviews and was disappointed. I loved the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse series. This was just okay. Nothing really exciting ever happened and no romance. The writing was good so I got through it quickly, but I will not be reading book two."
2,Not as good as I wanted it to be.,The book was pretty predictable and forgettable. I bought it used on Amazon and at the very end I discovered that two pages had been torn out. I kept reading and felt like I hadn't missed anything as a result of torn pages. Very disappointing overall because I wanted the story to be fun and sexy and magical but it was really just blah.
4,Great cross over into adult books for teens,"I work at a library, and often look for books with appropriate subject matter for teens in the adult section. This book series is perfect. I pre-read it to decide if my 13 year old could read them. It was perfectly safe subject matter for teens. The books are witty and fun with enough to keep teens to adults happy. I have been putting this out on the staff recommendation shelf at my library for the past six months and it always comes back with a big ""Thank you"" from the library patron. Read it if you feel like something light and fun to lift your spirits."
2,This book wasn't that great,"I read the sample and liked the story enough to buy the book on my kindle. I wish I hadn't to be honest, what a waste of $9.99. Where the first chapter was decent, it really started to lag in the middle and toward the end. The characters were flat, the story ended ridiculously and where is the story telling? The author didn't go into details on anything. Also the magical fight scene at the end was laughable at best. I was very disappointed with this book and will not read any of her other work."
5,"A great, light read for girls!","I was completely skeptical about reading this book when I bought it. But I was at a local Borders and Shanna was there signing books so, as a fellow entrepreneur, I wanted to show my support. The book was super cute! I found myself wanting to read it nonstop. After I finished, I ran right back to Borders to pick up the sequel, which, in my opinion is even better. If you're a girl in the mood for some light, fun reading with a hint of romance, you should pick up this book."
4,Cute & fluffy,"This book was just what I needed after a particularly gruelling quarter at university. It's the perfect book for giving my mind a rest without having to shut it off entirely, sweet without rotting my teeth.I particularly liked the idea of the city ""weirdos"" as magical beings; I have a few of those in my own neck of the woods.I look forward to the sequel - here's hoping there's a third!"
5,"wonderful, angular music","Tansman was a 20th century composer whose most obvious influence might be the neoclassical style of Stravinsky. I found his orchestral music didn't make an immediate impression, but the chamber music on this disc drew me in immediately. In this music, Tansman creates dense chromatic harmonies, fascinating imitative counterpoint, and idiomatic writing for clarinet. The performances here are also superb. I will be looking for more music by Tansman and revisiting the orchestral music recordings with a better idea of what I should be listening for."
2,Superficial information,"This book does not offer what I was looking for, namely some in-depth information on the Axim PDA. There is a lengthy chapter devoted to the stupid games you can play on this device. But I was hoping to learn how (if at all possible) you can create a shortcut to rotate the display. Or how to always have Word and Excel start up at a predefined zoom level. Instead the book tells you how to play BallBreaker."
3,book is too old.,written in 2005 this book is seriously out of date. needs an update. but since Dell quit making the Axim a few years ago it's not likely this book will ever be revised.
2,Do Not Bother,"This book has a wealth of information, but I really would not bother. The new smart phones have surpassed anything this device will do."
2,right: Not the disney version,"Wow I just decided to buy this DVD only because there wasn't other cartoons on the rack with a familar story. However, certainly this isn't the disney version. It is rather old. I would say more Scooby Doo quality, or the old Super Friends quality.The only good thing about this old cartoon is that it was during the days of more lax regulations, so the story seems a bit more realistic. So for adults, it's probably more enjoyable. Without the story, I would say it's a dull DVD.I would recommend the Disney's Fox Robin Hood over this one. But that's only if you don't mind animals always playing a lead role in American cartoons. Sometimes its just good to see humans on cartoons."
3,"Returning to the roots of Robin Hood vs. cartoons and Disney inspired ""variations"" on the original story","I bought this DVD with the idea of introducing to my grandchildren the ""real"" story behind Robin Hood. I was able to not only show them the story but to discuss with them (9 year old grand daughter and 4 year old grandson) the idea of injustice, helping those less fortunate than you, what to do when you have a problem - gathering like minded people to form a group (""band of merry men""). Overall, they were entranced by the story itself: particularly parts like Little John and testing Robin Hood at the river crossing, the idea of the Holy Wars in Jerusalem (they are not yet old enough to understand a lot of this) but they certainly love the story. Introducing Maid Marion, the helpers that Robin had in Sherwood Forest, the naughty Sheriff of Nottingham and the good Prince John and Robin of Loxley. A compelling story with all kinds of life lessons for this and almost any age group."
1,Does Not Work on an ASUS Transformer,I bought this item because the description stated that it would work on my android device. It was a waste of money since it did not work. I bought a simple Mac Airbook E-Net adapter and that worked as soon as I plugged it in. The description for this device also stated that it would work with a Mac Airbook but I woudn't count on it.
2,Have to have a very specific sense of humor,"I bought this for my Monty-Python/Fawlty Towers/Fish Called Wanda/etc.-British-humor-loving husband. We've barely made it through two episodes. I'm not sure if this was considered wildly funny at the time it aired, but if so, it hasn't aged well. We will likely watch additional episodes, but it's hard to get through them."
2,Shallow and less then awe inspiring.,"After reading the ""Second Time Around"", I wanted to like this first effort by Ms. Wainscott. I wanted to like it but I was disappointed. An interesting idea that brought no strong characterizations to the characters. I didn't care about the people in the book. Jaimie DiBarto was handsome, and devoted to the idea of being responsible to his wife following her coma, but other then that, who cares? I didn't care about any of the characters and that was what was disappointing."
3,Interesting background,"I got this from the library, and I have to say I'm glad I didn't buy it, because once I read it I had no use for it. It's not something you'd want to refer to in the future, unless maybe you were doing a research paper. I thought some of the explanations of the different preferences were interesting. But the writing style was dull. It was a very scholarly book, and thus not particularly readable. It came across as a textbook, which I wasn't expecting for some reason."
3,"good book, explains the personalities","good book which explains the personality types, but ""What Type Am I?"" is a better book; this book focuses on percentages of each personality in each occupation but not as much on the characteristics of each personality type."
5,Very helpful!,This product is very helpful as a warm-up tool. It is meant for those who have already had (or are currently receiving) vocal instruction.
4,Good basic warm-up program,"This is a good basic warm-up CD for singers who want to protect their vocal chords from damage, by exercising the voice properly before singing. She offers a variety of exercises that get progressively more complicated. There are a couple things that make it work for a contemporary singer (mahs for a bright sound and counting seconds to limit vibrato) but for the most part, it is made for a classical singer."
4,west coast beatles,i love this collection of beatles interviews proving once and for all this band had its famous roots in L.A. rock.
4,Grows on you,"This CD at first didn't impress me as much as make yourself sick did. However, once I realized that the whole CD tells one continuous story (not as easy as you think when the songs are shuffled on an iPod) everything comes together. The disc means so much more. The lyrics aren't always obvious, and you're constantly discovering new parts to the story you didn't notice the first time round. Listening to the doctor speak at the beginning and end of the disc also sheds a more obvious light on the sometimes abstract ramblings of the patient. All in all, well worth the $10 I got the disc for at warped. It's worth it for anyone picking it up here too, just make sure you give it more than one listen before you judge."
3,Same BNO? Um...Not really.,"To be honest, I love BNO's older stuff much better. This cd seems to lean more to the more mainstream popness you see on MTV. It's not too bad, but not too great either. There's a couple songs on Trainwreck that really stick but even the highlights grow old a little too fast. Have a listen for yourself. It's just not my sort of thing, really."
3,bland,"the song composing got me to buy this album, that and armor for sleeps latest cd, both that and trainwreck were produced by the same guy. however upon popping this cd in, i found more of the same old crap, its another concept album, which everyone seems to be doing lately, thanks alot greenday but alot of the songs just arent nearly as catchy as composing. im a fan of a lot of kinds of music, it just needs a hook, and only composing and track 7 caught my ear the first time through. after a few more listens my opinion might change but so far the 12 bux i paid isnt worth it. its gonna be tough for this cd to stand out in an already watered down and over crowded genre."
2,shame!!on u guys,there first and second album rocked hardcore rockedand they follow up with this I'm so disappiointed I'm gonna stop write>>
5,Took some heart,"Boys Night Out are from near where i live and i have always ignored them. First of all the name, Boys Night Out,i found it cheezy and then when i herd there music it made it even worse, especially that stupid song ""i got punched in the nose"" For about a year now i have been seeing shirts and sweaters that say TRAIN WRECK and they were cool so i was curious to find out what it was, and when i found out it was BNO it laughed. But about 2 weeks ago a friend of mine told me i have to check it out because its a good concept album. Ha i said, crappy bands making concept albums. So yesterday i was at a used cd store and i found a copy of the cd and gave it a listen and thought, for 10 bucks, i can alwayse sell it back to them if my friend is wrong about this one. once i got in my car and played it though, i was really suprised, and then when i got home and read the lyrics, i was even more suprised that it didnt suck, it was actually VERY good and i have it on repeat. go but it !(...)"
4,Teaches Differences are Okay,My son loved this book so much after we checked it out from the library that he did not want to return it! It is a great book that teaches children that it is okay to be different from your friends.
4,"Family feud, western style","Blackie and Red grew up in an orphanage. Red is a naive young boy who tries to do 'what's right' and Blackie is a manipulative boy who is selfish and spiteful. They are united in their hatred of each other and yearn for the opportunity to fight it out.After running away from the orphanage the two meet an old miner who adopts them. After the miner 'strikes it rich' their REAL troubles begin.I really enjoyed Blackie and Red. At times I found myself driving an extra mile just to listen to the tapes. Brand manages to capture the essence of youth and the feud perfectly. Towards the end, I really had begun to hope the two characters reconcile. I had grown fond of them and wanted them both to succeed.. I found the ending a bit of a disappointment. 4 stars."
5,Excellent!,"(From Planeta.com Journal) - Subtitled ""Architecture and Landscape across the Mexico-United States Border, this book is tour-de-force that gives visual explanations of the great changes at the heart of the US/Mexico Borderlands. The book is expertly illustrated with maps and black-and-white photos, but the majority is space has been crafted by the author. It's a wonderful medley of observations, historical anecdotes and interviews with the architects themselves. Highly recommended."
1,DOA,"I purchased this item several years agok, and it was returned immediately. Wouldn't make a squeak, and was really cheaply built. I guess I should have not expected much out of such a cheap product, but had hoped that it might at least be a good practice amp. Nope. Don't waste your time."
1,disappointed,The Pyramid GA250-Watt unit does not live up to what I expected.It does not have very much power at all. Can't be used for my intendedpurpose. Joe Halber
1,READ BEFORE BUYING,"do not waste your money on this piece of junk, it did not make a sound when I plugged my guitar into it and there is no 'clean' or 'distorted' so it's all supposed to be the same sound I guess. The packaging was pretty good, I will admit, but it looked like someone dropped it or something because there was a dent in the front. Don't buy this amp unless you just want it for looks (though this amp does not look good, it looks old) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!"
2,Hi-larious hijinks with the Neo-Nazis,"I bought this for a laugh, and was not sorry I did so. To judge from some of the other reviews, some people took this seriously, but it's patently false ... something that doesn't need saying, as by now almost everyone knows that Simpson is guilty. Still, its well done, in that the story is twisted around to fit the known facts. A curious book that I'm glad to have in my collection, for novelty value alone."
5,Ivanhoe {Aminated Version),"I have a a great many titles of this set. As stories, they are very well done. I like the writings of Sir Walter Scott."
2,"looks great, breaks easily","While this toy is really great looking and was my son's favorite birthday present, all the pieces broke easily within several months."
1,Lost the touch,"Some of the moves are nice to look at and some are even awsome, but it doesn't have that same touch of reality and heart it brought from the veyr first mixtap in the 90's. Its like when wrestling was hot you had Stone Cold and the Rock and Undertaker and now its more fake and water down with garbage. Even the moves arnt as realistic as they use to be.They are some good things like Johhn Cina but this is just a comperissen I CAN MAKE WITH MIXTAP DVD THE OLD IS WAY BETTER THEN THE NEW AND IT FEELS LIKE ITS MISSING SOME THING"
2,Not so hot,"My kids, who are 3, 6 and 9, and all huge science/nature lovers, have just not gotten into this magazine at all. They LOVE the Ranger Rick/Backyard issues they also receive, as well as some other kid magazines like Amer Girl and SI Kids, but the youngest two refuse to even pause to look through Click. Not sure why, since all the other reviews here are so positive..."
4,Lively memoir of New England boyhood,"Perfect for reading to oneself or sharing with the whole family. Hastings manages to bring alive the past, sharing tales of a long-ago culture. My only complaint with this book is that I wished there'd been a bit more dialogue and less description. Do try the recipe for old-fashioned baked beans - it was popular in our house."
2,Brief Overview,"This one is a little thin on content. Gives about a paragraph on every topic, but no detail on anything. You'd be better off buying a 2-3 books that give more detail on different topics like lighting, business, models, etc. Though a bit dated, John Kelly's ""Successful Glamour Photography"" is more useful and cheaper. ""Part-Time Glamour Photography : Full-Time Income"" is also a better buy. The photos are good, but the same handful of models are used throughout - no variety. As if they went out and shot the whole thing in a weekend and threw together some text. Get this only if you want a synopsis, but you could finish it in 10 minutes at the rack."
3,"Get your ""walkthrough"" ready","So far, after playing about 5 Nancy Drew games this is my least favorite due to the obvious difficulty of it. The story line is great and this should have been one of the best games in the series but they made it so difficult and put in too many ""red herrings"". If you play this game, it is much more fun to have the walkthrough printed so you can follow along during the many impossible puzzles. It is also the longest Nancy Drew game I played so far. Her Interactive needs to understand the difference between being ""fun"" challenging and ""boring"" challenging as this game was at many times. Not a waste of money but should have been much much better."
2,Zzzzzzz.......,"I bought this game in a four pack. If that little girl asks me to play another stupid game with her I'm gonna tell here where to stick the pieces. Without all the puzzles it wouldve been OK. It wasn't near as scary as people made it out to be and I'm a wuss. Just a long, long game that leads to a stupid ending. Although when she got ate by the plant, that was pretty funny."
3,A little too hard,"I like challenging adventure games, but I think the clues in this game were too abstruse, even on the junior detective level."
2,Not one of the best Nancy Drew Games,"I've only played a few but this one is not nearly as good as the other Nancy Drew games that I have played. There's just too much walking around the same places in the house over and over...and over. At the very least there should have been some clues outside so you could have a change of scenery to wake you up, but once you go in the manor house at the very beginning you're not allowed to leave. I couldn't finish it... it's just too boring."
2,I'm giving up on this one,"I've messed around with this game for about three days now and only found one object I could pick up, and don't have a clue how to solve any of the puzzles. What a waste."
1,Dissappointing and likely not age appropriate,"I was hoping for a game that would be similar to Message in a Haunted Mansion, or Treasure in a Royal Tower. Boy was I wrong! This game was full of tasks! I was going back and forth and still progressing slowly in the game. The plot was boring and I wouldn't think that even a teenager would find it fun, much less a child. There was very little to explore in this game, and you ran back and forth and had to do mundane puzzles to finish the game. And the game was a bit... creepy. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. I have played 5 Nancy Drew games, and I loved them all except this one."
1,HATED IT,"I thought it was hard, if I didn't have a cheat sheet,I wouldn't have a clue. The dungeon is rooms within rooms and I kept getting lost. I wasn't fond of having to play a game everytime I needed a flashlight. I didn't like all the other games you were forced to play either. Unfortunately I am still chasing the 13 ghosts around in order to get my next clue. I am finding the whole thing monontonous and somewhat frustrating, not fun!"
1,Boring,I found this game to be boring and the graphics so-so. I don't recommend buying this if you're over 12.
2,It Was Alright,"It wasn't what i expected each nancy drew game is getting so much easyier and there getting shorter and shorter.It says 20 hours of game play but it is only like 10 Hours Not even. Nancy Drew Company does not spend any time on their games any more. They try to do it as fast as they can alot of my brnad new anancy drew games have glitches in them. For example in stay tuned for danger i bought it that day intalled it and i played if for a week i beat it so i wanted to play on master detective but when i clicked on the cabnit in Matties dressing room in the begining of the game i ended up in dwanyes room before the end of the game. I recomend buying One of the first 6 games those are the best. Thanks. Signed,Annoymyss"
1,Terrible Graphics - Not adjustable,"After reading great reviews on the Nancy Drew series, I purchased Curse of Blackmoor Manor, installed it and went to play. There is no option for adjusting screen resolution and anyone who has a monitor larger than 15 inches will be terribly disappointed. As this is the 11th game in the series, and fairly recent, it is a shame HerInteractive decided everyone probably has a 5 to 7 year old computer with an inferior graphics card. Even if the game is excellent, the graphics are totally unworthy. Their website offers no solution and does not even address the issue."
1,Disturbing gaming experience,"After playing four other EXCELLENT Nancy Drew games, imagine my shock and dismay after having tried to get into this one. Being in agreement with the other reviewer, I am extremely disappointed that HerInteractive, a company which has put out so many wonderfully family-friendly games, would infuse this one with so much dark and innapropriate subject matter, such as witchcraft, astrology, mysticism and the occult. Not at all what I was expecting, I am sorry to report. My recommendation is to stay far away from this game and the harmful content that it contains."
4,"Great Game, but creeps me out","This is a great Nancy Drew game, but because it creeped me out a lot, I haven't finished the game yet! I won't spoil any of the exciting and suspenseful parts of the game, but let's just say it was creepy and a little weird. It was still very fun, and I loved to play it. You probably don't want to give this game to a child younger than ten. Trust me!"
4,Very Challenging,"These games get scarier and more challenging with each release. This is one of the few Nancy Drew games I haven't finished yet. This one is REALLY freaky. If your younger child (8-10 years old) wants to try a Nancy Drew game, I recommend letting them play a few others before getting this one. This one is really, truly SCARY. If you are experienced with the Nancy Drew games, then you will enjoy this one."
2,nancy drew,i could not get the game to down load on to my computer at all. i even tried it on another compuertor won't work
2,Nancy Drew: Curse of Blackmoor Manor,"My first Nancy Drew mystery game; based on reviews I was very disappointed. Yes, graphics are great, but there is no direction of what I need to achieve; I fumbled from room to room repeatedly, then figured out I have to make my own checklist; no map to jump quickly from one location to another; I just gave up initially, but will try again later. Not thrilled with having to get a walkthrough from other sites just to play some of the games. I like to figure things out myself, not rely on a walkthrough."
4,Came without a case,"Just got this game in the mail today and the game is what I wanted -- since I had this game when I was little but the CD was scratched. The thing I wanted to point out was because the game was sold by SpaceBound, Inc. (if that has anything to do with it) but the game came in a plastic wrap with the CD and the booklet. Not even a case. I'm not penalizing the game, because I love Nancy Drew games, but it's odd the game didn't come in a case."
4,"Cool, fun, challenging!","The coolest storyline and graphics amongst the ND games, in my opinion, BUT the puzzles can be quite challenging. Took me a long time to finish the game. I had to use the ND website for many clues, but I am not the savviest game player anyway. Definitely worth the time and money."
1,Not a good first choice,"This is not a good first choice for a novice gamer nor is it a good first choice for a Nancy Drew computer game. The clues are so vague they are almost non-existant. Somethings can only be done at certain times and I would never have known anything without the ""cheats"" posted on the internet. Even the cheats are confusing. I am very sorry I wasted my funds on a game I am not able to play. No more Nancy Drew for me."
4,Great Game,"I'm an avid Nancy Drew Mystery player, and Curse of Blackmoor Manor was great. It was scary and fun and pretty interesting. The puzzles were really hard, though. This isn't HerInteractive's BEST game, but it is worth the money."
4,Creepy But Cool,"This game was good in a certain fashion. It was good in the scary way, but it just didn't seem to live up to the former ND games."
4,Awesome game!,I really liked this game. It was really scary at some parts.I also liked that it was in England. The puzzles were hard though. You should buy this game!!!
4,"Graphics Are Vivid, Good Mystery","Nancy Drew as an interactive game works because of the good mystery and graphics associated with the game. Enter Blackmoor Manor and you enter a labyrinth of detailed halls and rooms. There are ghosts, mysterious characters, and danger lurking everywhere you turn. Slower than games geared toward boys, but great for girls."
4,Scary PC Game,This is a great game. Never played Nancy Drew PC Games before. I had to use the cheat forums a lot because I kept getting stuck. This game gets scarier as it goes along.
3,good but confusing,"this game started out enchanting and fun but as I got into it it got confusing and the puzzles were challenging and the events didn't seem to have any affect on the crime. (I even sometimes forgot what the crime was!)if you want a really good nancy drew game I suggest danger on deception island, teasure in the royal tower or secret of shadow ranch!"
2,A review from a 10 year old girl,"I played this game with my dad and my cousin, we thought it would be a lot of fun, but it turned out to be close to impossible for us, even my dad. Getting through the maze, even with cheats, was incredibly hard and you need to do it many times. It says ages 10 and up. but it should say ages 20 and up , the only way to beat the game is with the cheats. Some of the game you play with the little girl are fun, but some just drive you crazy, and require way too much knowledge of astrology and chemistry and rune reading. for younger kids I would recommend a game like Shadow ranch which was easier and less scary. My little cousin (age 8) freaked out because it was so scary."
3,Such a Shame...,"Oh my, I really, really, REALLY didn't enjoy this game.When I play the games (and I've played them all), I like to start on the Senior level and play without help. I don't mind wracking my brain, stepping away, and coming back to something.But this game? I couldn't play without a great deal of help. I never really understood what I was doing or why or how. I really didn't learn much either. And that's what I've always loved about the games - walking away knowing a little bit more about something than I did going in."
5,A Game For All,"You've already heard about how great this game is from other reveiewers, so I don't need to say much. I'd like to say one thing though. Most people think this game is just for preteen girls. But, that's not true. Curse of Blackmoor Manor, along with all the other Nancy Drew Games are games that are for all ages. From children to elderly, including men! I promise you these games will become a part of you. Once you start it's impossible to get them off your mind. You will become addicted! Curse of Blackmoor Manor is no exception. I am a male, one of my friends had me try one, and I have become a huge fan! It doesn't matter if you're male, I didn't think I'd like it either. I didn't want to play this dumb little girl game! But I played it, and now I can't stop! Men! You have to try this game! It's for you too! Believe me, it will be worth your time!!!!!!!"
3,Aggravating,I have played many of ND games and I found this one to be the least amount of fun. The puzzles are extremely tedious and time consuming. This particular ND game is more focused on the puzzles than on the mystery itself. I became so overwhelmed with the aggravating and difficult puzzles that I didn't finish the game. This game is impossible without reading a walkthrough to get through it.
5,Pure Entertainment!,"The Curse of Blackmoor Manor offers hours of investigative fun and challenge. The game plot is intriguing and plausible--very well written. Graphics are unbelievable! The puzzles within the game that are presented to the gamer are extremely challenging, but workable. A support system is available on-line with Her Interactive. Some portions of the game are perhaps too scary for young players. Parent supervision would be adviseable."
3,Disapointment,"I have to say I thought this game was going to be really good but it wasn't. It was OK. I think it's very hard. Partly entertaining. But Her Interactive wasn't exactlly in it's finest hour with this game.AlchemySecret PassagesDifficultPuzzlesAstronomyFake ENglish Accents""witches""tricksplots"
2,It was OK...,"Ok I played this game and it was OK in the beginning but as you progress through the game it gets very boring and I admit the puzzles were kind of purplexing but not as hard as Her Interactive reported it being and it was also NOT as scary as Her Interactive said it would be either... So my conclusion is that The Curse of Blackmoor Manor was a cheesy game, and you SHOULD think twice before purchasing this game from Amazon or anywhere else... If you want a scary Nancy Drew Software Game than I reccomend either The Final Scene or The Message in the Haunted Mansion..."
1,Unreadable......,I place the blame firmly on myself for buying a book recommended by Essence magazine. The premise is interesting but the execution is HORRIBLE.I threw it down last night and just threw it down just now.This book is unsophisticated and corny.
3,Did I miss something?,"This book started off kinda slow, but it did pick up towards the middle. This author is very talented and I like her writing style. But as far as the story line it was kinda of weak. For some reason, I could not get into this book at all. I would not recommend it for readers who have a short attention span like myself. I tried reading this book like three times and just finally gave up and took back to the bookstore."
3,Funny but a little drawn out.....,"Acey and Lydia are in their 40's bestfriends successful in their careers; living in Oakland, California. Oneday while sipping their drinks they come up with a radical idea of opening up a spa, A Sister Spa.This spa will cater to the needs of black women everywhere. Svelte, muscle bound men of every ethnicity, shape and size are hired to satiate the desires of women. Distress surfaces when a preacher T. Terry begins to preach about morality dying and immorality being born.The beginning starts off slow, with alot of dressing and too many characters. After around page 290, the story picks up at a different pace and all the clues dropped earlier on are resolved. The novel was still a good read and do recommend it!"
3,Had the potential to be an insightful post-feminist novel...,"... but it's relegated to the pile of early 2000s pop fiction with its constant brand name-dropping.Jill Nelson makes some interesting and insightful points about the expectations of black women and black men with regards to sexuality and morality. But in another writer's hands, I think this would have been a more literary, more lasting work."
5,Off The Sexy Hook!,"This book is a TRUE work of art! Miss Jill thank you for chunking out the belief that we as black women can't or shouldn'tembrace or very sexual selves. The main characters are all me at different times of my life. You made me laugh so hard I cried. You wove the book with a smoothness but aggressive enough style that made it very difficult indeed to put it down. The sex is raw and uncut, and even if we all don't talk aloud in this manner about sex, we think about every single day. The ways in which we want sex! Who we to have sex with! How much we feel we need ""Sexual Healing""! I encourage every woman, black, white, or other to read this book and pass it on. There IS Power in Sisterhood!!!P.S. If you know any openminded men PLEASE give them a copy they will thank you for it, over and over and over again.:) :) :0 :)"
2,Not Great.,"I loved Jill Nelson's other works including Volunteer Slavery. I did not like this book. I read the whole bole. The subject matter was interesting and I was curious as to how it would be treated. The sex parts were boring and somewaht trite. The characters were one dimensional and could have been developed more. The actions in the book were so unbelievable that I thought there was going to be some type of trick at the end. I got this book from the library and I am glad I did. Jill, you got talent but the fictional writing needs some work. Keep at it girl. The one positive thing about the book is that it did make you think about yourself as a sexual being that has a need to be respected and cared for always."
3,3 is good,I gave this book 3 stars because it did have potential. It was a little too drawn out for me and I found my self skimming through some of the chapters. It was an okay book. Glad I borrowed it though.
5,"I LOVED IT (Anita Doreen Diggs, author ""A MIGHTY LOVE"")","SEXUAL HEALING is an honest, wickedly funny and vivid fantasy that kept me turning pages well into the night. I only hope that someone reads it and actually opens such a spa for the sistahs.A truly irresistible first novel. Brava!"
2,Sexual Healing? How about dysfunction.,"I was severely disappointed in this book. After reading the synopsis, I thought I'd be in for a delightfully, funny read. This book droned on and on and never caught my attention. The story line has possibilities, but between the one dimensional characters, the product placment overkill and the superfluous chatter between the characters, it was lost. Every other chapter had a poorly devised erotic scene and more banter between the characters. I gave up halfway through this book and took it back to the library."
2,Yellow Pages for a foreign resident,"Laid out alphabetically by subject, this book is of some help for the English-speaking foreign resident of Seoul or its environs. Much more detail would be helpful, as would at least one map of the city itself. Even directions of how to get to places are too general.There are many better resources for the expat in Korea, including basic guidebooks of Korea, The Expatriate Handbook does, however, have a niche and will come in handy at times."
5,Brilliant,"It's got it all - hooks, pop sensablities, rock bombast and Nashville rooted twang. All mixed together in a tasty stew and served with a side of wit."
2,the company 's business practices are terrible,I have requested information on how to get a return number several times and no one has contacted me. Very poor business.
