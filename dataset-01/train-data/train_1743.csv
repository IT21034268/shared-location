5,Advertizing,After What seemed a struggle the issue was resolved. The Advertising of a Boxed 939 processor and getting a OEM processor was not what i was expecting but after a few E-Mails my Money was refunded and the processor was shipped back. GOOD customer service!! Thank you very much.
2,GM Manual,I ordered the book because I have a window motor in my car that needs replaced and I've run into a few issues with it so I thought I'd buy the manual to see if there'd be any helpful hints or pointers. No such luck. The book told me everything I already knew I needed to do but no tips on how to make it easier or prevent myself from breaking the glass of my window. Oh well...i'm sure it will be helpful for other things down the road.
2,HORRIBLE REPRODUCTIONS,"I'm not sure if this can be said of all the versions being sold here, but I was completely disappointed with the print quality of this book (which was listed as ""Collectible""). The pages look like there were printed from low-res scans. It's distracting and absolutely do not do the fantastic art inside justice.Buyer Beware."
2,Sickening!!,"This work is sick! plain and simple. What also upset me the most was the seemingly plotless stories. The only good story is the final one where it seems the characters actually have some sense. It was obviously the author's intention to write the most sickening, depraved, bloody work possible with these short stories and in that sense he pulled it off.So, I'd only recommend this book to those who have seen it all and who don't mind feeling their stomach churn while reading (seriously).I only give this work a 2 star raiting instead of a 1 due to the well drawn illustrations.And so on that note I bid you...good day."
4,Better than the First Book,"Like the first book in the series, ""Well of Darkness,"" I enjoyed reading it. Overall, it was written somewhat better than the earlier work. Weis/Hickman dropped a lot of the simplistic/childish atmosphere in the first book and wrote this one more for adults (that could be a function of the main characters actually BEING children in the first book). There are several logic holes/disagreements that irritate me about this book. But, they're easily forgiven. Also, the first book tended to portray Good as stupid and Evil as clever. In this book, the authors modified that a bit so that Good was merely weak, but, unfortunately, Evil is both clever and overwhelming. I don't know if that's an improvement or not. I'll have to wait until I finish the third book before I figure that out. If you've read the first book, this one is definitely worth reading, too."
4,Book 2 keeps up the pace,"Guardians of the Lost keeps up the pace introduced in the first book of the trilogy. Freed from having to build a new world from scratch for the reader, the authors can devote their pages more to new plot and the resulting story flows much better. The book is a very quick read, and at times I almost feel guilty for sucking down this fantasy mind candy, but there is enough creativity in there to keep things honorable. My only complaint is that for a book that purports that good and evil exist in balanced harmony, the bad guys sure seem a lot more powerful than the good guys. As one example, consider the fact that the Vrykrl can communicate with each other over any distance by using their blood knives, whereas the Dominion Lords have no comparable skill. This small complaint is not enough to keep me from yearning for the publication of the third book, however!"
5,satisfied customer,"I truly recommend the HairArt 28"" Mannequin, the quality of the hair is there as the length and the density.I have already done few different haircuts, and different styles even using the curling iron and the result has been great. So the price is payable. If somebody need one long hair manniquin this is it."
3,Give me the professional version,Interesting. I'd like to see the professional draft. It's a great idea but a lot of the book is a nice college history paper rather the professional.Hopefully it will inspire more writing on Hypomania. Good job!
4,"A set of mini biographies, under a common theme","If you are wondering whether you should buy this book based on a desire to learn about hypomanics - Buy it! The time you invest in reading this book is nicely hedged. At worst, you will get a series of well-written biographies of extremely interesting people. More likely, you also will learn the mind of the hypomanic. At best, someone you care a lot about may be much better understood, and this someone may be yourself.The concept of the book gets five stars. The stories that compose the biographies are told very well, but only very well, which is what drops the review to four stars.If you are truly hypomanic, I'm sure you will rate it 7 stars!"
1,A character with no character,"0 stars for this flop of a movie,the story maybe made sense but the characters that played,did not have personality,no comedy,no romance,no action,no mystery,no character,no nothing."
2,What is her name?,"You will be asking yourself this by the end of the movie. In fact, you will be asking yourself why you bothered to watch the movie. Poor Julian Sands. We needed to see more of him. Max Beesley was quite good, but not enough of him either. Julianne Nicholson couldn't have been frumpier, more unkempt or unattractive if she'd had the House of Wax make-up crew all to herself. Most of the film made no sense, and the central characters lacked any kind of common sense. Jessica Fletcher would have a field day with this group. In fact, the setting might actually be Cabot Cove! It's anyone's guess."
1,Incorrect Year of Book. Do NOT Buy,"I was so looking forward to reading a historical book from a much different time period than the present. I was under the impression that I would receive one of the original editions from the early 1960s in a white jacket, as the picture shows. I was very disappointed to receive a book from 1974 (over ten years later), revise and with a totally different cover, etc. It's pretty important to be accurate when it comes to dates of books and this is absolutely inaccurate. Very displeased. Do NOT buy, it's false advertising."
4,Creative book,My 15 mos. old loves all the flaps and peek-a-boo's you can find in this book. There is so much going on in the book that some times he loses interest but it will be great a little down the road.
5,My Cockatiel loves it!,My Miki loves this food. She's a 8 year old cockatiel and has been eating this most of her life. I noticed her feathers looked better and she didn't lose as many after I switched her to Kaytee exact. She dives into it at every meal. I do add some sunflower and other seeds for variety. I like that is doesn't have the bright artificial colors that many bird foods do.Thank you for making a great product.
5,Delightful,This is a wonderful movie. I have loaned it to many. We need good movies like this. Thanksyou for having it available to us.
5,great stories!,One of the best sports writers of all time.Noserious sportsmen should miss one of the greatest classics of all time.
4,"It ain't a book, but it's Adventures In Odyssey!","Fans who were on the edge of their seats can rest easy now...we know who the wedding couple is. But I can't tell you! You have to buy the thing for yourself!Also included, besides the three Wedding Bells episodes, are some episodes with the Mulligans, and other, happy slice-of-life episodes from AiO.It's enjoyable, and it teaches lots of lessons. It's wholesome, and enjoyable. Buy it today!"
5,FABULOUS!,"Started blooming the day after I put it in the window (indirect Eastern exposure)! I guess I shocked the other one when I re-potted it... this one, though also re-potted, did not have any of the dirt disturbed...it is AS SHIPPED...WONDERFUL plant, I love it!!"
3,Does the job if it holds together.,"Peugeot Ternate Acrylic Nutmeg Grinder 11cm/4.25""We needed 2 nutmeg grinders. We had one much less expensive, perfectly adequate one but decided to buy the best -- at least the price of the Peugeot grinder indicated it must be the best, & the reviews were good. Within 4 months the screw holding the mechanism together fell out and the entire assembly lay in pieces. We figured out how to put it together, but the screw that had fallen out proved inadequate to the task (and holding the assembly together while reinserting the screw required incredible small motor coordination and dexterity). Went to the hardware store, bought a slightly longer screw & voil√°. An item this pricey should be assembled better."
5,Pink Floyd: A Classical Tribute,I love Pink Floyd and I love Classical Music. So nice that the two have met!!!
3,parents use caution,"This book starts with the gunshot suicide of the lead character's father.It has a reasonably entertaining plot, but I would be cautious about just giving this book to a child.Adult themes. Lots of slang and non-standard English. Thefts, threatened violence, plenty of secondary characters talking about sex, getting pregnant, and getting dumped. Police brutality.Death of the child's companion; hopeful homecoming.All that aside, if even one kid reads this book and learns more about Hoovervilles, and the misery brought about by Progressive policies, then it will be worth it. Hoover believed the economy should be managed by experts -- always a recipe for disaster."
4,Can't Put the Book Down or Call Anywhere Home,"Nowhere to Call Home takes you into a wonderful world of excitement. Main character, Frances, finds out she is suddenly poor and an orphan. Frances doesn't want to have to go to her aunts house and live with her. She is afraid that nothing will be the same. This books tells how she becomes a hobo and meets many friends. Her first friend on the road, Stewpot comforts her. Frances lies and changes her name to Frankie and acts like she is a boy. When Stewpot gets sick Frankie doesn't know what to do. Will Frankie face her fears and save Stewpot before it is to late? Will she tell Stewpot about her secrets? To find out and see what Franikie ends up doing read Nowhere to Call Home."
5,This makes the top of my favorite book list!,"This was a thrilling story that I could not put down. I have read this book many times and never grow tired of the captivating story. This book places you in the time of the Great Depression as a young girl who wants to live life as a hobo. The main character (who's a girl),Frankie, sets out to try life as a hobo after her father kills himslef after losing his fortune on the stock market crash. This book has you live the life of a hobo and is very interesting. From hoppin' trains to working for food, it's all here in this great book. I highly recomend this to all readers older then 10. This book will win a special spot on your shelf, too!"
1,Inspriation or something else?,"Don't buy this book! Many of the scenes, situations, names, places, and even dialog are taken from a 1934 book by Minehan. The author says she was 'inspired' by the Minehan book. When the dialog is copied word for word as well as the scenes or part of a scene from another author's book, one has to think of another word. Examples: pp. 67-69 in Nowhere and pp. 15-16 in Minehan, pp. 146-148 in Nowhere and pp. 8-10 in Minehan and many more, page after page, just compare the two works. This is how a best-selling author writes? I notice that *she* doesn't want anyone copying *her* work."
5,Nobody can't like this book!,Anyone who doesn't like this book must be crazy! That's all there is to say about this book because it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good!
4,No More Dead Dogs,"How would your life be if you never told a lie? Sounds good but it could get you in trouble! Wallace Wallace goes through life only telling the truth because his father was a chronic liar. Wallace Wallace doesn't let others make him lie even though the truth often isn't what others really want to hear. And why do the dogs always have to die in our books? ""No More Dead Dogs"" tells the story from many points of view. Read it!"
5,This book is funny!,"I read this book and it is so funny! It all begins with a boy named Wallace who can't tell a lie... he REALLY can't. So he has to write a review for a book, Old Shep My Pal. He writes a bad review, so the teacher makes him rewrite it. He winds up being temporarily kicked out of the football team and he starts helping the drama club out with their performance of Old Shep My Pal. Wallace winds up changing the whole play around.You have to read this book! It's hilarious! All of the characters are so funny, from the girl who keeps writing notes to her favorite celebrity, to Wallace's ex-friend!!"
4,Entertaining with a moral,"I am a parent and read this book to approve for our school library. I really enjoyed it. (Actually, I had a hard time putting it down.) The only thing questionable was a few uses of ""Jackass"" (in a teasing way). I worried about it, but finally decided that it's OK. Gordon Korman is funny, and the characters are interesting... both boys and girls will relate, since the narrative voice switches between several main characters of both genders. The story is very funny, but there are also some great lessons about friendship, loyalty, honesty, and doing the right thing.Age recommendation: 6th grade and up"
5,Hilarious and fun,"If you're sick to death of reading supposedly ""good"" books that have only dogs that die, parents that divorce, and children that are abondoned.... then you'll love this refreshing story of Wallace Wallace. He hates those kind of books, too, but when he writes an honest book report, he's in for all kinds of trouble. The characters are real, the plot moves along quickly, the dialogue is clever, and the ending even has a cute little twist thrown in. Okay so it's a bit predictable... but at least you don't have to mourn anybody! Read it and laugh."
4,No More Dead Dogs is the Best,This was a very good book. I think No More Dead Dogs is for all ages. It had me laughing out loud at least 10 times. The funniest part was when the doll for Old Shep blew up! This book is listed under football but it is more about Wallace Wallace's8th grade year. Better get this book soon!
1,No More Dead Dogs,We ordered 14 books of No More Dead Dogs and more than half of the books are misprinted. Pages are out of order.
3,Tyler's book review,"The book No More Dead Dogs, written by Gordon Korman is a realistic fiction novel. This review will help you decide if you like this book. There are many middle school aged characters and some humor. The book is about a kid who gets detention and can't play foot ball. He joins the drama club. The chacters are not that good. My rating of this book is a 3 out of a five. My reason for this rating is that the book was not that good and the setting was pretty boring and Where it took place was not that good."
1,A rare miss for Korman,"To be honest, I didn't finish it, it was that bad. I'm surprised that Korman, wrote a book as bad as this. I've enjoyed his others books and was looking forward to reading it.It has a very interesting plot. A boy is bothered that when famous books has dogs in them, the dog dies at the end. The school puts on a play from a famous book where a dog dies, and the boy re-writes it. Fine, great idea for a book. The problem comes in when each chapter is written from the point of view of one charter to another. I had to keep on going back to the start of the chapter to see who's point of view it was coming from. It was very confusing.Please don't judge Korman's work from this book. He's a good writer with a lot of great ideas, but this book isn't one of them."
3,no more dead dogs,"No More Dead DogsThe book No More Dead Dogs is mainly about dogs dieing in books. The main character, Wallace Wallace is a football player who was the best football player. Wallace Wallace gets a detention and has to stay in the drama club until he writes a proper essay on a book in this book, Old Shep My pal. Then he goes back to football after everyone at drama club accuses him of destroying their play, Old Shep My Pal.Wallace Wallace is prep but the book didn't say much about his looks. Wallace Wallace can never lie, he just but he does lie to Rachel once in the story.Yes I did like it and I don't normally like books, it was good even though I kinda knew what was coming up next. I would not reccamend it to a friend because me and most of my friends don't read books."
3,No More Dead Dogs,"Wallas Wallas is a football player that got on the detention list therefor he couldn't play on the team while he was on the list. After school was football practice and he knew he was on the list but he whant on to practice anyway because he didn't think it was a good reason to be on the list, because the teacher told him to give an honest opinion on the book Old Sheep My Pal . The teacher didn't think that he was honest so he got put on the detention list. So after they pulled him from football he got interested in the play. After a wile some bad things happened and the cast blamed it all on Wallas but come to find out it wasn't hit and he saved the play.Wallas is a teenager that likes football,he lives at home with his mom and helps his mom around the house allot.the book is real good in my opinion. It was very funny and dramatic I would recommend this book to all of my friends."
5,No More Dead Dogs,"The book No More Dead Dogs, written by Gordon Korman, is a realislic fiction novel. This review wiil help you decide if you like this book. There are many different middle-school aged character's and also some humor.Wallace Wallace played football for the Gaints, he also gets detention with Mr,Fogelman. He quit the playing foot ball to work on the school play. He gives suggestions about the play. When he guit the team, every one on the team hated him. Trudi sarted a rumor that she and wallace wallace where going out. I would give it a five out of five, because I love the book,I would recommedation to a yonger kid than me.I love the part when Rachel and wallace go out with each other."
5,One of the Best California Surf Recordings Ever!,"This is one of best compilations of California surf recordings ever! You get Surfin' U.S.A. by the Beach Boys, Summer Means Fun by he Fantastic Baggys, Dead Man's Curve by Jan and Dean, Surfin' Safari by the Beach Boys, Surf City by Jan and Dean and many more. This is a great summer album and brings back many memories."
4,the tragedy and wonder of Central American birding,"Maslow does a fine job of presenting his quest for the the magnificent quetzal, legendary bird of the Mayans. The book chronicles not only his search for the bird and aspects of its natural history, but presents encounters with many other birds of Central America as well. Home to some wondrous birds in the almost magical rain forests, Maslow shows though that the avifauna and the land they inhabit is threatened by instable politics, unchecked population growth, and deforestation. A must read for any interested in birds south of the border."
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"Wow... I was relunctant to write a review for this book, but its atrocities was too overwhelming to ignore. I would NOT recommend this book. Buy Barron's, it's harder, but prepares you much better. This book is just filled with too many errors. First off, some of the multiple choice answers don't match with the explanation. Such as this one problem on page. 83 where the explanation says the answer is A, yet the answer they give you on top is B. Other problems abound when they try to explain simple things such as Electron Affinity. I don't know what kind of explanation they attempt to give but whatever it is, it is far off from what I've learned in my Chemistry AP class and from what my teacher has taught (Also different from the Princenton Review Explanation). I would NOT recommend this book. If you do buy this book. God Bless you when you take the test."
3,"It's not coffee, but it's not bad (it's not great, either).......","I agree, it's pretty weak stuff, using a rounded tablespoon in 16 oz. of water. I think it's bland even if I use two tablespoons. I regard the drink as hot brown water. I'd like just a little more character / personality.I'm going to try some Pero to see how it compares.UPDATE: Pero had more flavor, but it wasn't good. It's hard to describe. Maybe like someone stirred it with a crayon? And raw white flour?Also, the powder didn't dissolve as completely as Caffix's crystals. I had a lot of foam on top.I like Caffix better if I mix instant decaf with it. A ratio of 2/3 Caffix to 1/3 instant decaf. Much better."
1,wrong product,I ordered the instant beverage crystals. I got the powder instead. I wanted the beverage crystals because they dissolve better in water. I was unhappy with the powder.
2,acfix,thought it would be a good sub for coffee but it tastes nothing like but i will try it again but add flavor to it
5,Cafix,"Excellent hot drink. It tastes a little like Postum, and without any caffeine. I would certainly recommend it highly for an alternate for coffee."
2,Missing Postum,I'm looking for a Postum substitue and this isn't it. It tastes nothing like Postum. I can't rate it has a coffee substitute as I don't drink coffee.
2,decieved,"Watch out for this buy. The disc that Amazon sells you is not the same as advertised on TV. I was very upset when I saw that there was only one CD, half of the songs you see on tv arent even included."
2,Buyer Beware,"Seller's do not disclose to the buyer that this is only one disc in the set. Many will think it's a great deal, but buying one cd brand new for $15 and not getting the whole set is not a deal. Buyer beware."
3,Beware of Radio Edit,"THE BUZZ is the mass retailer, single-disc version of the Razor and Tie label's two-disc tv offering. While it does not include some of the most influential artists of the nineties (no Nirvana, for example), it offers a solid representation of the decade, including such artists as R. E. M., Collective Soul, Sublime, Third Eye Blind, and Filter. Unfortunately, the disc contains the radio edit versions of Sublime's ""What I Got"" and Everlast's ""What It's Like."" These edits, as well as the inclusion of the pervasive Soul Asylum's ""Runaway Train,"" are the reason for my three-star rating for this disc. By the way, those looking for the second disc of the tv-offered version of this album should purchase NON STOP 90S ROCK, also issued by Razor and Tie and available from Amazon.com."
1,Buyer Beware Indeed,"They do not tell you that there is only 1 CD when there's supposed to be 2. If I would've known, I would've at least liked to have a choice of which CD I wanted. And $15.00 for one CD is NOT a deal afterall."
4,Nice tunes,"This CD contains a great collection of songs from the mid and late 90s. Definetely worth a listen to and it is highly recommended. I have to say that I am a little disapointed by the misleading music track list here on Amazon, the list goes up to 18 songs but the copy I bought here at Amazon only had the first 15 songs, specially and painfully missing ""All I want"" and ""Runaway train"". BUYER BEWARE this CD only has the first 15 of the 18 songs listed here on Amazon."
2,not as seen on tv.....,"I thought that I was getting the CD that is being adverised on TV with a ton of great songs....however, this is a VERY condensed version with all of the not so great hits...very disapointing...."
1,The Buzz,"I'm so unhappy with this CD. the songs are edited and I never saw anything telling me that it would be as such. Did I miss something? Just really makes one feel like they didn't get what they paid for, and was quite disappointing."
1,READ THESE REVIEWS AND BEWARE!!,"I have done a search on both Amazon and E-Bay for ""The Buzz"". All the search results are the same. This ONE DISK CD. The offer presented on TV (www.musicspace.com) is a TWO CD set, with 33 songs. This one (and the others on EBay) are a reduced version of the two disk set."
2,kew it was kew,"i rate this 9 stars because the songs were yellow.. not blue or pink, but yellow.. and yellow is my favorite color, and yellow is a good color for songs"
5,"A sassy, feel-good story. Well written with excellent characterizations","Don't be fooled by the age or size of this book - it packs a huge punch! Cute beyond description; sexy and romantic; full of magic; very likeable and highly principled characters; set against the backdrop of fighting for a worthwhile and compassionate cause; and best of all, showcases that true happiness and meaning in life is uncovered by all the little loving things we do and not by how much money we earn or how prestigious our career is. Vicki Lewis Thompson has a wonderful style of writing that made this story a delightful treat to read."
1,Broke my heart from the start...,"I am such a big fan of VLT books that this one really shook me up. I can usually read one of these books in one sitting, but between the pace, lack of feeling for the characters, and no interest in the so so plot this book was very easy to put down, for days at a time.I didn't find any of the things that make her books special to me, like, funny people, colorful descriptions, locales described in a way that made me want to be there. Usually, the characters in her books are so well developed that I not only know exactly how they look and act, I've picked the ones i want to be friends with; here, as gray and as flat as can be.I have never been so dissappointed in one of VLT's books before that in the middle of it I went back to make sure of the author I was actually reading. I still wonder, who really wrote this book?"
3,in case you dont know....now you do,"yes this is blaq poets first official release,the same one who reps queensbridge,the same one thats down with screwball.this cd released in 91 showcases the same poet you hear now.....gutter-as-hell.the beats get a little dated at times but for the most-part its still grimey.the producer name is hot day,i read in an interview with poet that he called hot day ""the marley marl of queensbridge back then"" i say you decide for yourself. oh ya one more thing....don't sleep on track 6 with poet rhymeing alongside a very young cormega!"
3,Took a while to recieve.,"Took a long time to get to me, but book was brand new and in perfect condition. Packaged nicely."
5,Excellent view of a bygone era,"Like one of the reviewers listed, I saw this for the first time on USA Network's Night Flight (an excellent music video show, superior to MTV) back when I was like 14 or 15, in a small town in Texas. It was amazing to see then because it was a view of something so far outside of the world I was living in, and I loved it. I bought a copy of it a few weeks ago and saw it again, and still thought it was great, though now for different reasons. In a world where ""alternative rock"" became mainstream, and now seems to have been superseded by other, darker forces (like the Backstreet Boys), it's fascinating to see the beginnings of what led up to everything from Lollapalooza, Grunge, to all the other buzzwords of the 90s. I'd love to know what happened to the various people in this film, who's now living quietly in the suburbs, who's still a punk, etc. PS: go buy Social Distortion's new live CD: Live at the Roxy."
4,Punk rock!,Great film about a great time in punk. The naive charm of this tour is hysterical. A don't miss for Social D fans.
3,slow paced but interesting portrayal of early cali punk,A little slow but it contains some good scenes with live music. The rare appearance by Minor Threat made the movie.
4,Another State Of Mind,"although they did leave alot out and it would have been even better if the directors where accually on the bus, they would have caught a little more of the reality. some parts of the movie are rediculous, (such as one of the roadies dying his hair about 5 times) all of the rediculous parts where because of the directors. it is definatly an amazing, rediculously funny film that caught how punks back in the 80's lived there life (watching TV all day and then going out and playing shows). i would recomend this movie to everyone and to get more of a grasp on things, watch the Youth Brigade, and the dicrector's commentary (i would tell you to watch the Mike Ness commentary, but all he can really remember is a gnarly fight that he got in while they where in New York.). Oh, and i totally agree with the guys of Youth Brigade, they should have taken out the stupid goth chick... D-U-M-B!"
5,Wouldn't want to be without it,"Absolutely love this book. So chock full of wonderful advice that is based on common sense and instinct. References and resources that are invaluable. This is my second copy. I read, reread, and reread my copy when I had each of my 5 children and now that my daughter is expecting, I knew she had to have a copy of her own. In my opinion, this book was even more important to me than What To Expect When You're Expecting. I have recommended it to many friends. Fantastic!"
3,Red Sox MLB Backpack,"The logo and size of the pack met the expectations of our 12 year old fan. The quality of the material was by far a failure. The second month in use and the entire lower corner has been torn away. The nylon was either caught on something or tugged free after being snagged on an item and tore.The features of the backpack such as organization and pockets were all great and it held a full size binder, two texts, a lightweight jacket and lunchbox with ease.I would not buy a backpack again unless the material used is a durable blend such as is found in LL Bean,LandsEnd or Jansport backpacks. The price paid, while in line with other MLB backpacks, has left me disappointed based solely on the lack of quality chosen for the material. I own another MLB backpack (happens to be Yankee licensed) and the quality of the material used is on par with the afore mentioned companies."
5,Jerry Vale is Jerry Vale.,"The CD cover shows Jerry Vale on the shore, waves gently rolling and pooling at his feet, intently gazing far straight into the vast blue horizon.The picture accurately depicts what this compilation is all about. Like the waves, Jerry's song delivery is as serene and peaceful; and like the horizon, his vocal range is as limitless in its range. Here is an artist in a medium that he knows best, a singer in total harmony with his song which is further reinforced by the soothing and quivering quality of a crystal-clear voice and the seemingly effortless depth and feelings that go into the performance.The songs that made Jerry Vale Jerry Vale are here: Go Chase A Moonbeam, And This Is My Beloved, Enchanted, Innamorata, Prima Donna, Solitaire, You Don't Know Me, Pretend You Don't See Her, all delivered with unequalled gusto by this maestro of song.If you want to know what Jerry Vale is all about, this album is the best place to start."
5,"Jerry Vale ""Greatest Hits""","I HAD ORDERED 2 CD'S OF JERRY VALE'S RECORDING. THEY WERE BOTH USED, AS ADVERTISED. THEY BOTH ARRIVED TOGETHER IN A VERY SHORT TIME, MAYBE 8 OR 9 DAYS. CD'S WERE PERFECT WHEN I PLAYED THEM.I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE PURCHASE AND THE SOURCE.I WOULD MAKE MORE PURCHASES FROM THE SAME COMPANY IN THE FUTURE"
4,Greatest hits???,"Some of his greatest hits are missing. The one hit I liked and enjoyed the most was ""Stay as Sweet as your are,"" and I could not locate this song on any of his ""greatest hits."""
2,Not The same Anymore...,"We bought this stuff on occasion (loved it) for quite some time, but now it has changed. Bought some recently and found it to be very mild and tasteless. Used almost the whole jar! Still no flavor. Thought something was wrong and bought a jar a few months later, someplace else. Same result. Won't buy again, have tried another brand (A Taste of Thai brand Curry Paste, available in 4 different flavors), will stick with that. Liked that this came in a nice sized jar, versus a packet, but without flavor, what's the point? Hope this is helpful..."
1,They changed the recipe,"I used to love their curry paste and so did everyone I'd cook for. It was spicy, flavorful and authentic. They've compeletly changed the recipe and it's now truly void of spice and flavor. So disappointing!"
2,Not spicy at all!,"I am so disappointed with the Thai Kitchen green curry paste. I used the entire bottle and it still wasn't spicy enough (trditional Thai curries are usually really spicy). I found that this curry paste was just salty. My friend, who is Thai, uses the more authentic curry paste in the cardboard carton. I just didn't want to pay $6 shipping. Thai Kitchen is an americanized Thai curry. I will not buy it again."
2,Not the same anymore,"After another failed attempt with this paste, I got frustrated. I've used it for years, and it worked fine. I thought I was doing something different, but after the 3rd time, I decided there must have been a recipe change. That's when I did a search to see if anyone else felt the same. It's good to find it isn't me but disappointing that I won't be able to use this paste anymore."
4,BBQ with a Thai twist,"The only drawback to this product is how hard it is to find. Amazon to the rescue...I come here and order several jars to keep on hand. Roasted Chili paste is a key ingredient I use in making a BBQ Tofu dish. I don't like tofu all that much, yet this dish makes it one of my favorites for guilt-free goodness. BTW, this product stores just fine in your cupboard, and when you need a kind of spicy, slightly smokey and unexpected ""kick"" in any dish, this will do it. Use in making your own BBQ sauce (I combine w/Tamari, lemon zest and sesame oil); add to stir fries, eggs...it's great."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CRAP!!,Used the entire jar to make green chicken curry. No flavor whatsoever.What a rip off. I love Thai food and this is an outrage...
1,"Used to be a family fave, not anymore",This product was a long time staple in my pantry. A family favorite dish using this paste used to only require 1 teaspoon for great heat and flavor. Now using half a jar isn't giving me even close to the great flavor we used to enjoy from this product.We are very disappointed that this long time favorite will no longer be a part of our recipes. Will have to find an alternative. It is no longer worth it when even a whole jar cannot give me the flavor I desire.
4,Good product like the capsule.,I was injured in 2005 and have to use a feeding tube. So everything has to be pulverized and mixed with water to be pumped in the tube. The capsule is much easier to use than a hard pill. The only negative thing is it turns a dark brown which is not very appealing. I've had very good luck with this company. Good prices and quality. That is saying a lot my general opinion of Pharmasutical company's is that they are just one step up from Hitler. So for me to praise one is something.
2,picture does no show content,"The Swanson multivitamin picture does not show content, the picture is blurred.Without seeing the content one cannot evaluate quality. if you go to Swanson directly you will see content clearly."
5,About Attitude: Nutcracker Noel,"Snappy dialogue and hilariously realistic body language bring to life a story that clearly illustrates the magic of a carefully crafted perspective. Generously sprinkled with subtle humour (for both adult and child), this is a year round family favourite."
3,A Collection of Audio Transmissions from the Apollo 13,"As is evident by its title, this Cassette contains some of the audio transmissions from the Apollo 13 mission. The Apollo 13 mission was the third attempt to land a crew on the lunar surface; however, due to an explosion onboard the Command Module, the landing was aborted and the crew returned safely to the Earth after many trails and tribulations. The tape presents the transmissions in chronological order and of course contains the most famous quotes from the mission. For example, ""Houston we have a problem"","" one whole side missing"", and ""Farewell Aquarius"". In general, I feel that most space buffs and those studying the Apollo 13 mission would find this tape fairly interesting, but the short length of the tape, 35 minutes, (plus a 6 minute speech by JFK) is hardly good coverage of a flight that lasted 8 days.This cassette is also available on Compact Disc."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a poorly researched and poorly written disappointment. I had hoped that it would be better than others by this author, but it was not. It is shallow, with characters that behaved in ways that were not at all believable, especially considering that the story is set in the Regency. I had trouble finishing this book, and do not recommend it."
5,Cd,Thanks got cd really fast works great. Thanks a lot nothing to complain about or much to say about product.
1,Do not waste your money!,"This book is very poorly written and an outdated mess that should not even be called a book. I was looking to learn some useful insights into the vision of Steve Jobs that transformed so many industries, instead it read more like a cheap gossip tabloid you find at the supermarket check out. The ending chapters read like the author was trying to cram everything in at the last minute and jumped from one thing to another. Made no sense. I am sorry I wasted my time and money. If you want to read a balanced and insightful biography definitely buy Walter Isaacson's book. I did and very much enjoyed the journey."
2,A Not So Insanely Great Job on Jobs,If you want juicy tidbits about personal moments with Steve Jobs - then this is a good fast read - if you want any insight into Steve Jobs - this is a even faster read because there isn't any. Don't buy this book if you want any depth - analysis - insight - anything other than personal moments with Steve Jobs.This biographical thing (let's not say a book) is a mish mash of accounts of Steve Jobs actions and non-action. There is the tyrannical BAD STEVE and the benevolent GOOD STEVE - but then there is the horrible writing of the author and lack of any direction - or any support to the conclusion of the book.My Positive Note: The one good thing I would have to say about this book is all the history on Pixar and Next that I didn't know about....other than that....stay away and wait until someone comes out with a book that Steve Jobs can at least admit has some interesting - fairly portrayed points about his life or he writes his own book.
3,"Not quite what I expected, but OK.","I bought this book after reading an excerpt on salon.com, expecting the book to be full of similar stuff. Unfortunately, I think that the excerpt was the strongest point in the book. The excerpt appears at the beginning of the last 50 pages of this book. I was hoping for more meat to cover events around and after the launch of the iMac, but the vast majority talks about the time period around the time he left apple through 1994, glossing over the rest of time up to january of this year. I have to admit though that I read it in 1 day."
3,"Ugh, reads like a 700-page newspaper article","This reads like a newspaper or like aStar Magazinearticle. But, it's a very very long Star Magazine article. It has a lot of good information about Steve Jobs, but I didn't like the style of this biography.I didn't know much about Steve Jobs, which is why I bought this, and so I accomplished my goal of learning about him. I didn't realize he was a vegetarian and a jerk. The picture this book paints of Jobs helps me realize why it makes total sense how Jobs has taken Apple where it is currently. Also, I listened to the Audible version, and the reader is great.Pros:+Spends a ton of time about Pixar, and I like Pixar+Has a lot of information about the early Steve Jobs+Gives a pretty objective of Jobs, anyone reading this book is probably going to conclude that Jobs is a megalomaniac.Cons:-Only goes up to the year 2000-Has an annoying writing style"
2,Not very good at all,"The author's writing style is atrocious. He doesn't make Jobs into a fun character to read about, instead he's annoying and the book is annoying to muddle through. It's a real shame because it could have been a blast. Thank God it had a story about Bill Gates prank calling Jobs or it would have been a total waste."
3,Ok book about a terrible man,"and let's not forget about the ""think different"" campaign. Jobs didn't even bother to get a linguist to check it and after he found out it was gramatically wrong, instead of changing it or at least admitting he was wrong, he cooked up some big idea of how wrong could become right, once again using his standard ""cool"" line."
2,The Pompous CEO,"I'm glad I don't own an Apple computer because after reading about Steven Jobs I would sell it. His treatment of employees just goes to show you that being ""smart"" doesn't mean a thing."
3,"Something Old, Something New","For the reader who wants to know how Steve Jobs turned Apple and Pixar around, this book is fine. The author hits all the points that need to be explored. The writing style is excellent, and the way the author moves from crisis to crisis in Steve's life keeps the reader hooked.If you are already familiar with Mr. Jobs' story, skip this book. The treatment of Steve's last few years is superficial and some of the sources are practically humorous. (His *building contractor*??)"
4,"Exciting and Interesting, but Perhaps not Fair","I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, but I do not feel it does Mr. Jobs justice. Deutschman always keeps things interesting, but he is almost certainly too harsh in his critique of Jobs. The problem with writing any biography on Jobs is that he is a fairly personal individual outside of his business persona. There is a general feeling throughout the book that Deutschman is captivated by Jobs but does not necesarily like him. However, because there are so few recent biographies of Mr. Jobs, this one becomes a must read. Worth the time for any Steve Jobs fan, not for its insiGHT, but for its insiDE information and story telling. If this book was written today, after Jobs renewed media darlingship, I think it would spin him more positively."
3,"Good start for beginners in the modern ""folk"" tradition.","Classic trompe l'oeil (""true"" and ""flawed"") is rarely understood by even seasoned contemporary artists. This book is no exception, but the attempt to share is certainly worth the effort for any novice."
5,A great resource book for beginners and accomplished artists,"My art teacher offered this book to students in my first class on painting murals and furniture. I found it to be an excellent source of ideas for beginners and those with previous experience. The step by step directions made it very easy for me, as a beginner, to get acceptable results the first time, plus there are fabulous projects for those with more advanced skills. Thanks so much for such a great resource book."
3,Content is of quality but with little diversity,"This book could be of no help or inspiration to me for the decoration projects I have which are more ""murals"" like. The exemples depicted are fun, well detailed and well explained but cover mainly household items on shelves all in the modern folk art tradition. These can look really nice in a home but I have trompe l'oeil windows, arches and blue skies in mind for mine and couldn't find any in there. Number of stars depends on needs... and I need another book."
4,Nice Math Refresher,I think this is a good book to go through before you jump into the official exam books. I really liked the Geometry section since that was where I was feeling the pinch when I started looking at the GMAT books. However I think you would get away by not doing the Algebra & Arithmetic since they were pretty simple.
1,"Its Very Basic Book, though it says refresher for GRE etc.","Its Very Basic Book, though it says refresher for GRE etc. It starts with 2+3=5 and continues with only very very basic details with the most complex formula in the book being ""Area of Circle=Pi*r**2""."
1,Unbelievable simple,I bought this book looking at the product details and the content. I was expecting it to have some tips and trips to save time in calculation or computation. I must say that I was very disappointed with it. 10th graders perform more complicated math than what is shown in the book. It is oversimplified and gives a false sense of confidence to the test taker. Returned the book immediately.
4,Good for the mathematically challenged,"I have always struggled in math. This book presents all the basic concepts you'll need for test taking. The main problem is that the book is not always detailed enough. Several explanations are not very satisfying, and sometimes leave more questions than answers. However, the book is a good way to refresh your memory on basic mathematic concepts. Despite it's lack of detail, it is still a worthy investment."
2,refresher: YES; time-saving tricks: NO,This is book is only useful for reviewing fundamental concepts. This book is NOT useful for learning and practicing time-saving strategies. Most of the problems are solved with a step-by-step process. Time-saving strategies that I learned elsewhere online allowed me to solve the problems FASTER than using the time-consuming step-by-step methods found in this book.
4,Very Basic Math Refresher,"I haven't had a math class in ten years. This book helped me review BASIC concepts that I haven't touched since high school (like adding and multiplying fractions, etc) in preparation for the PSB Nursing School Exam. I scored a 99% due to this book. I did find some of the word problem explanations to be lacking in clarity and had to hit the google for a better explanation, but this is a good place to start in your test prep for reviewing BASIC concepts."
5,GRE math refresher--great!,"The concept reviews and practice sets were easy-to-follow, focused and extremely helpful. I highly recommend this book."
5,Filling in the gaps,"It's been 30 years since I took a high school math class, and so when I sat down to prepare for the GRE with a Kaplan math workbook, I was lost. This book takes all those basic principles, breaks them down into clear and easy to understand parts, and gives you plenty of practice. I highly recommend this as a refresher for anyone preparing for the GRE."
4,A great warm-up!,"This book is perfect for those who have a) not had a math class in a while or b) little confidence in their math skills. As one of the mathematically crippled myself, I felt I needed a brush up on my skills. This is a great entry-level book with wonderful step-by-step instructions, both of methodology and practice problems.This is a ""leg up"" book, though. You definitely need to couple this book with more advanced practice to be successful on the GRE. Try the Barron's comprehensive study aid."
2,Not enough for GMAT,"I just finished my GMAT exam yesterday and not found this book helpful. I like the layout of all the contents and the exercises are great. However, this book is only good for ""refresh"" my rusty memory. I need something more advanced. Besides, this book was published in 1999 and GMAT has gone a little more difficult than it was before. So, if you are like me who is preparing for GMAT, you can definitely get this book for a easy start, but make sure you get aother book that is more updated and more advanced."
2,Very Low level book,"I bought this with hope to get my brain used to solving complicated problems quickly. However, the quality of excercises in this book is very very low. I could have made up any of the excercises in the book. Unsatisfied, I returned it in 2 days. Do not buy it if you are very good or even avarage at math. This will not help you."
2,This book is toooooo basic,"Don't buy this book - unless you are a complete zero in math. This book reviews stuff that you have in 3rd of 4th grade in school. I sat down and worked through all of the problems in this books, and it took me about 2 hours (with no difficulty). Believe me, this book is for PSAT or SAT rather than for graduate school exams such as GMAT or GRE!"
3,A little too basic....,"It gives an okay overview of the basics, but it is not challenging enough for the GRE."
3,Great,"This book provided a good refresher in terms of math skills that have not been used for a while. It had good explainations and questions, however I would use this early on and study actual math tactics in a GRE math book specifically, because you do not have enough time on the actual GRE to do the math questions as explained by this book."
2,"Too simple. Dwells on basics for too long,omits a lot of important material.","Dear Reader,It's been a while since I've written a review,but this time i felt compelled.The ultimate math refresher promises a lot and delivers very little to none. I bought it for an upcoming GMAT test. GMAT math is still substantially 'below' GRE levels, so I really don't understand how this book can claim to prepare for higher levels, when it doesn't even cover the full spectrum of GMAT necessities. While it will explain how to add fractions in almost painfull detail, proper treatment of nasty word problems, algebra- and ratio questions has been almost completely neglected.I was extremely disappointed. I read a couple chapters and discarded it in favor of an EZ solutions practice book together with the official orange book. Even the Kaplan titles bring more to the table then this thing. All in all disappointing."
3,Not very helpful,"I'm awful at math, and bought this book to help me prepare for the GRE. I was not very impressed with it. Since the GRE is multiple choice and you have limited time to finish, you need help on how to cut corners (e.g. work backwards, guesstimate etc), which this book does not provide. I found the math chapters in the GRE-specific manuals much better. That said, if you need a short refresher on math -and- have plenty of time to prepare for the GRE, this might help you out. For me, the Princeton Review ""Cracking the GRE"" and the Kaplan GRE comprehensive edition worked better."
5,Excellent review!,"I was faced with the frightening prospect of taking GREs again, some thirty years after the first time I took them, since I'm now applying to grad school for a second Master's degree. I expected that I'd have no problems with the written portion of it, but frankly the math portion terrified me.This book provided succinct and clear explanations of the basic principles I needed to do well on the math section. I am sure I would have scored in the 10th percentile without it; with it, I got a very respectable (for a humanities major) 650.I have since passed it along to my daughter, who was preparing for her SATs. Her comments mirrored mine. I look forward to seeing how her scores improved over her first administration of the test.I would recommend it highly."
3,Multilevel marketing is not for me...,"This is probably an excellent book for anyone who chooses multilevel marketing. To me, it was boring, and I guess I'm just not a sales person."
1,Not the originals,I wanted one song. The fine print sez something like all selections are new stereo recordings. Keep looking this probably isn't what you want
1,Instructors need to utilize a different text for beginners.,This book was a good idea but poorly executed. The authors slap some impressively technical definitions in the text without actually making an attempt to translate what the definitions mean. They provide numerous examples but instead of explaining the examples they add a formula underneath it without providing any real explanation of the formula. This leaves the student frustrated and painstakingly searching the internet for an explanation to the author's lack of explanation. This book is not worth the money they charge for it and will leave your students thinking that mastering the basics of statistics is impossible. This book does not provide a good foundation to act as a statistics book for beginners nor does it offer anything to those experienced with statistics.
4,good,"Im not much a reader , but im not so goof with math either and yea so far this book is good has helped me understand a lot of the concepts its very clear overall good. Helped me a lot on my first midterm so far :)"
1,Made for TINY TINY seats,"A previous reviewer noted that these were cheap and tore as soon as you sat in them. Sure, they're cheap. They're $20 seat covers! I figured they'd fit in the relatively tiny seats in my '90 Miata. No such luck. They were NOT meant for ANY sort of bucket seat, as there is no fabric allowance for the bend where your butt sits. They will MOST DEFINITELY tear if you sit on them in that state.Also, the red in the pictures is deceptive. It's a shiny burgundy velvet that does not match the typical red used on cars."
1,DISAPPOINTED!!,"I liked the dragon design, but that was about it. The seat covers were not universal!! When I put it on my seat it didn't fit. I stretched it as much as it would go and when I sat in my seat, the seat cover ripped! I was extremely upset. I wish I had never bought the seat covers."
3,got what i paid for.,"Color was very nice, its a pain to completely attach i to the seat, s i leave it on, but not totally tied down. I bought this product used, but i didn't expect a huge rip in the middle, and later on it started to tear in other places. if your thinking about buying this product, I subjest waiting it t lower in price, or find a new Idea for seat covers."
5,Very interesting!,"This book makes comminication fun and interesting. I am using this book for a speech class, but I find that it is an interesting read outside of school. The writing is very clear and examples pertain to every day life."
4,Easy to use coffe grinder.,"It takes a bit of effort, but the burr-ground coffee elevates the taste just that much more."
1,out of box failure,This coffee grinder would never have worked unless my husband was able to machine it. The rotating burr was rubbing against the bracket which the grind adjustment screw is mounted to. There was no way to adjust the grind.
5,Amazing Work,"This is definitely one of the best cds out there. Pax has matured so much since 217 lyrically and musically. Everything about this album is good. They combine rock,a little metal, rap and funk excellently. And yes I have heard all the bands out there so I am judging PAX against the best and they are at the top. I reccomend everyone going out and buying this incredible display of musical talent."
5,These CD is Great,"PAX217 has come into the market and I love them. They're music is in style while keeping the Christian lyrics. Engage is a great CD like TwoSeventeen before it. I cant wait for the next one. Also go to thier web page and check it out, ..."
5,Wow...,"This is truly an excellent cd! I liked their first one, sure, but it was lacking something. This cd picked up what they were lacking and brought it all together and just made it awesome! I especially like ""What is Love"" (no. 10) and ""Melody"" (no. 9). What is Love is definitely my favorite. It has a very good message and sounds awesome. When I fisrt listenned to the cd, I didn't even really listen to it, and then it came to 10, and I was wondering if it was really them because it was just so different... In any case, excellent cd! Get it!"
5,Well worth the CASH!,"This Cd has become a new favorite and since I got it on tuesday, I have been listening to it straight through. I loved PAX217's self titled CD back in the day, but Pax has seemed to imporve their ""tightness"" when playing together and are very comfortable on this album. TO explain it easy, its soemthing you can listen to and just move wiht, its hard, its musical, its sweet. FInd it wherever you can and get it whereever you can, and try to see them live cause in myopion, these guys are on the same level of talent with guys like POD and Incubus man. GOd Bless, rock on."
3,not bad but not great,"I'm not a big fan of pax217 because they are a little two heavy for my taste. They have some good songs like ""gratitude"" and a couple others. My suggestion is hear it before you buy unless you are in for some heavy music"
4,Good and cheap!,"The good news: these sheets are very inexpensive and look very nice - good color and subtle but visible stripe. The thread count makes them soft. The down side: they don't fit tightly onto the mattress, and they're so soft that they don't have that crisp feel of new sheets. I haven't used them long enough yet to wash, but I suspect they're going to need ironing. For the price, I feel that they were a really good buy."
2,sheet set,"I am so very unhappy with the sheets. They are flimsey, wrinkle and stain. Would never order sheets thru amazon again."
4,Expensive Plastic,"The first hotshoe bubble level I purchased survived a whole year and a half before it fell off my camera somewhere in northern Iceland (I did spend several hours back tracking but I was unable to find this bright green $30 piece of plastic in the snow). As far as tools go, this is one of the most frequently used item in my camera bag. I use it for the vast majority of my shots to ensure I have a level horizon (which makes stitching panoramic shots much easier). The only drawbacks are that the plastic may eventually wear away enough that it no longer fits in the hotshoe leaving it rather prone to slipping out without much force and the price: it's a $30 piece of plastic with an air bubble! In all fairness, it does hold up to abrasion rather well."
4,bubble balance digital camera,"this is a bit pricy for what it is, but useful for handheld shots and if your triprod doesn't have balance indicator a good thing to use. nice and compact and seems decent quality.."
5,Priceless,20 times easier than using the bubble on a tripod. Priceless when it comes to straight horizons. Definitely worth its weight in gold.
4,Does what it is made to do,"I find a bubble level to be a must with a tripod, even one with a built-in bubble level...and this one just works better than the built-ins. The level slides into the hot-shoe of the camera and does what is intended. I find it particularly useful when used with my Gorillapod and a small head. Anyone who has ever used a Gorillapod knows that it is never level due to the flexibility of the legs, so a small head plus this level make for a very nice package. Also,it is handy when hanging pictures."
1,Bait and switch!,"I ordered this item and it came form 47th Street Photo. However, instead of getting the Adorama bubble level they sent the Opetka version. I guess I should have known better since the Adorama is a more expensive item and the one advertised here is the same price as the Opetka. So if you think you're getting a good deal forget it, this is just a bait and switch deal--I won't ever trust 47th Street Photo again. That said the item is OK and probably worth what I paid for it, and it looks like it will do the job."
2,Bubble Levels,"This is my third bubble level. I have had two 2 axis levels both of which weren't accurate. This is the third inaccurate bubble level. This one can be put on in either direction and clearly isn't accurate. I fix the situation by using a ""Sharpie"" to mark the level lines on the plastic (and remarking as necessary as it wears off) once I have set up the camera focusing on a 4 foot level placed in a picture window sill. I suggest that everyone check the accuracy of their bubble level by a similar technique. You will probably be surprised if you bought a $5 to $10 bubble level. I have never bought a $30."
3,"good performances, only ok sound","This archival recording is more important for its rarity of material than its sound quality. The sound is mono throughout. It's very clear and precise, but the mono from the 1950s is unexpected given Stokowski's experimentation with stereo for the previous decade. The contemporary Grainger material (taken from English folk songs and morris dances) seems also a bit on the lightweight side given Stokowski's fame for heavy and emotionally pounding romantic material he's famed for.The Clare de Lune, also a mono recording, is only slightly above par of the Fantasia dvd extra (which is showing signs of age). The recent EMI Classics release of Stokowski conducting Debussy is in stereo and a better performance as well."
1,Online Market Research for Dummies,"At best this book is a very general overview of market research concepts that are not even specific to online surveys. For instance, don't ""lead"" the respondent.Its best isn't very good though. For instance, the authors repeatedly refer to Excel as a bona fide analysis tool. No professional worth his or her salt would use such a tool for this purpose.At its worst this book is full of misinformation about web development. Before I bought this book, I wish I could have read the review that points out the authors' total misconception about Tcl, or ""Tickle"" as they call it.Even more incredibly, there is an entry for ""Tickle"" in the index!If you are at an intermediate level or higher in either market research or web development, this book is completely worthless."
5,"Informative, Readable and Very Useful","I found this book to be very helpful in understanding a number of methodologies for devloping online products, and written in an accessible manner. In addition, the book provides the reader with the abilty to conduct their own online research. I also checked out the companion website to the book, provided by the authors, which I found very useful. It gives online access to updated research resources described in the book."
2,"Handbook means reference, and this is not a reference","There is some good information in this book but for the most part it is far too simple. For instance, almost no attention is paid to the critical topic of validating user data. I've heard this should at the least be done on the server, and possibly on both the client machine (using Javascript) and the server.Again, no useful information is presented on the matter of preventing respondents from going back and changing data once they have entered it. These are a couple of issues that have been encountered by market researchers who have already managed a web survey or two.While this book cannot be all things to all readers, it does claim to be a handbook. Handbook means reference, and I expected these topics to be covered better."
1,Most preposterous mistake I've seen in a computer book,"Check out page 46 of the 49 online. It shows the entry for ""Tickle"" in the index. Of course this should be TCL (Tool Command Language), but the authors are apparently trying to pass themselves off as being more knowledgable than they really are. This is the most preposterous mistake I have seen in any technical book, and I've read hundreds. Would you trust the authors to advise you on how to conduct research when they so miserably failed to research what TCL is? This mistake was pointed out by a previous reviewer, and now they demonstrate it for all to see by making the index available on this very site?! These guys need to TAKE some marketing lessons, not offer them."
4,Long Time Owner,"I am a long time owner having had one for 12+ years. This skimmer will work very well when setup properly.As others have stated it is a pain to get it going right, but pulls tons of gunk once running. I would buy again."
4,Good product/great price,"For the price, this is an excellent product. Took a couple of days to adjust, but it works just fine."
1,Average shopper,"Very disapointing, To be honest, this is junk. I wouldnt waste any money on this item. It is poorly manufactured, It dose not come with any instructions to speak of, and it falls apart after about 45 seconds of use. I spent a few days trying to get it to work, and my efforts were fruitless. Also be warned that this is a hang IN tank unit, it does not sit on the tank very well, the bottom keeps falling off and the resivor is tiny. If you do manage to get it to work you will need to empty the cup about ever 8 to 10 hours, and try not spilling any of the stuff back into the tank in the process."
4,A great teaching tool,"What I love about the both the book and the author is that he is willing to share the ""tricks of the trade"" as it relates to his craft. When it comes to voice-overs, it is such a tight, competitive, ""who you know"" market, and the fact that he is willing to share his wealth of information is beyond priceless for anyone looking to break into the industry. A must read for up-and-comers."
2,Not for the novice,"By the time you get to this book, you probably already know you should take classes, get a good demo etc. What you need to know is how to market yourself. To that end this book is a waste of time for the novice. Sure, if you're already a singer and have connections in show biz, why not switch gears and try out for voiceover? That's what the author did. This book irritated me -the author is pompous and the book is shallow at best. He doesn't spend enough time on how to market yourself, but encourages you to spend about $10K for an in home studio - if you REALLY want to make it in this business. This guy's condescending and as you take his advice, remember, HE's the only one doing any banking with this type of help."
5,Make your dreams a reality!,"You Can Bank On Your Voice is a book that I wish I had while a communications major in college. I would have chosen a very different career that aligns with my natural love of talking and entertaining. But better late than never right? You Can Bank On Your Voice is thorough, concise and inspiring. After reading it you will be many steps closer to making your dream of being professional voice talent a reality. It covers everything you can think of. Consider it your bible--read it often, apply what it says and you will save time, energy, effort AND have a great edge over the competion.Success in the voice over industry awaits you. Seize this book and seize the day!Reviewed by M. Lorraine for www.goodgirlbookclubonline.com and The GOOD GIRL Book Club"
5,"Inspirational, Informative and Easy to Read","This is why I love this book and have referred it to others, both established and aspiring voice talent: 1. Quick and easy to read. 2. Provides comprehensive overview of the ENTIRE gamut of voice work possibilites (there's a whole new world of opportunities out there). 3.

2,Missing something in the story!,"I found this romance to be average. Too many different parts of it were too hard to believe. While this is the way with many romances there is usually enough lightheartedness in the story that you forgive it.This is Marianne's story as she escapes a misunderstanding, which has her as part of her Uncles murder. As she is escaping she meets a widow who is on her way to marry a man as a mail order bride. but along the way the train she is on becomes and accident victim and mistaken for the mail order bride....I thought that the people chasing her (especially the one in the town she is in) would not pursue her harder."
4,fun series,One review on here states that this series got better as it went along. I agree. This series really does improve with each episode and the final conclusion is quite satisfying. This entire DVD set plays out like one big movie. I love the cast and the characters in this series. Cool and funny heroes and hot female warriors! What more could I ask for? This is great! Plus the low budget fx don't hurt either. Brian Yuzna produced this and nobody does low budget effects like Yuzna. I like cheesy fun and have a good imagination. Conan the series has provided me with hours of fun.
1,Dreadful this isn't Conan.,"Awful, what a joke. true Conan fans leave this garbage alone.Howard is probaly turning over in his grave right now.This made for tv trash is is not what Conan is about. Stick with the movies and the book."
5,Heart of the Elephant,"Short of reading the miniseries by Marvel....This is the best ""adaptation"" of the ""Heart of the Elephant"" that you will find...AND.....""Heart of the Elephant"".....is....what ""sword and sorcery"" stories..are all about.'nuff said.....buy it."
5,Great Service,Great service and quality and good protective packaging. Will definitely order again from this company. Everything was exactly as stated.
1,Wish I knew How Good This Book is...,"I would love to be able to review this book, but... Amazon (Still!!!) shows this as shipping within 24 hours. Don't believe it, I've been waiting since November and have approved numerous delays, just today I approved another. Just so you know, this book takes 2 months to ship (minimum!), and I still don't know when I'll get it. By the way, same deal for the Encyclopedia of 70s Music.Amazon, it is time to be honest to your patrons, change the estimated shipping date to something realistic!"
5,"Soothing, relaxing music to calm the soul","Wow! Great CD compilation of piano music. I was very impressed with each track and can't get enough of playing this CD. Surely one to keep on my ""Best"" list!"
2,NOT CURRENT MAP SOFTWARE,This does not have the current map software. Current software is an added $75 on the Garmin website. That makes this price $75 more.
2,Hard to input destinations.,"The navigation was fine, but I had a hard time inputting destinations while on the road (and yes, I did pull over). The screen is tiny as well, and it doesn't scroll, so you can't just point to where you want to go on the map the way you can on some GPS units. Overall it's the interface I found cumbersome. I sent the unit back after a couple of days of trying to read the screen and scrolling past my destinations again and again. Give me a touch screen."
2,Mounting problem,"Guiding the directions and other functionality is good. But I am very much worried with the mounting of the device. Initially I was mounting to the car mirror, but for every 10 minutes it was falling down. Later I mounted it on dashboard, still it remains the same problem. It loses the attachment and falls down.While I was trying to mount it again, I almost missed with an accident on an highway as I was concentrating for mounting. I really hate the mouting technology..."
1,Thoroughly lost,"The I5 is a miserable little device.I bought it for a road trip from NH to western PA.The first time I used it to find an econolodge in Wilkes Barre,it insisted on leading me to an empty parking lot half a mileaway.It didnt know half the streets in Franklin PA. I tried to get tothe Franklin airport. At the junction where one is supposed toturn right to get to the airport, it insisted that I must turnleft and head into the city!On the way back, it got me to the right exit for the Super 8 motelin Danbury, but after the exit it had me turn left instead ofright, and eventually led me to someone's house instead of thesuper 8.Basically, in every instance where I really needed it to work,it messed up. Im returning it for a better device.Unfortunately, there's no simple way to clean up the list ofrecent finds on it, so it must go in with a record of my travels.In addition to better navigation, a little ""delete all"" option inone of its menus would help."
1,Broke in 2 weeks!,"I can say that this device ""exceeded my expectations"" for 2 weeks, and then it died.We figure that the failure had something to do with the electrical system because it first faultered when plugging it in. When the batteries were replaced it worked, but then failed again and did not come to life with new batteries or with prayer or anthing thing else.I will not buy ""Garmin"" again, and I hope that you do not buy Garmin, either."
2,MSRP Way off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,Garmin has the MSRP for this exact model listed as $399.99 on their website. That is only around an $80 savings. Amazon needs to update their list price on this item.
2,My dog can play poker . . .,"The old joke goes, my dog can play poker. But he's no good - - he wags his tail whenever he gets a good hand.The StreetPilot is amazing. It really communicates with satellites. It can tell where you are, and find routes to other addresses.Of course, it's a slow and painful battle to enter the target address with the one-wheel-no-buttons interface. It has a tendency to choose nasty snaky routes with thousands of turns, presumably in an effort to save you 1/2 mile versus a sensible route on major arteries. Every now and then it directs you into a parking lot or a nonexistent exit. It's constantly losing the satellite signal. Then it falls off the window ... again.You can make the effort to use this unit and marvel at the things technology can do.Or, you can use Mapquest, print a nice map, and be ready to go in 15 seconds."
4,Great but go for C320,"This one brought a price-wise revolution in GPS industry.I5 is the cheapest GPS reciever available with the ability to hold all of North America.However, with SD card so cheap and C320 on sale, I do not see any reason for not going for C320 which has a bigger screen and touch screen which makes data entry a breeze wheras entring address from wheel can be frustrating.I am a lifelong GPS user and I think C320 is the best product for under $500. I used C320 side by side by Street pilot I5 and Neuvo and MS streets GPS. Garmin mapping functionality is almost identical but bgger screen and touch screen makes a difference.The only limitation with C320 was no preloaded maps and expensive external memory. Now a 2G SD card costs $40 and 1 G (which will have 90% of US) costs $25. So I do not see any reason for going for smaller Street pilot I5 or much more expensive C330."
3,Garmin StreetPilot i5,"Good for directions, but does NOT announce the streets as they come up. You have to constantly look at the screen for the street name. It just says ""turn right in 500 feet"" which is OK unless there a number of roads at about that distance."
1,Loses satellite reception on a clear day,"I've owned this unit now for about a year. While it doesn't always provide me with the best route, it does provide me with a reasonable route. When it can find satellite reception. Last night, it lost satellite reception for a full half hour. Possibly because it was cloudy? Today, though, it lost satellite reception under clear skies.Very annoying."
4,Good value,"Like it a lot ... small size is cool ... Does a great job mapping directions ... wish that it showed more street names, but given how small it is I understand the tradeoff ..."
3,go with the garmin touchscreen,"I have a garmin c320 and this I5. It takes me literally 10x longer to put in an address with the wheel on this than it does a touchscreen garmin. It is cute, small, and works. If you want entry level..go with it. If you plan to use it alot... GO TOUCH SCREEN!"
4,Navigator,"I purchased my Garmin in March and have given it enough time to write a reliable review.I think it's a fabulous item to have. I'm a wedding photographer and it's put my mind at ease.The minor problems that I have encountered are:On cloudy days, or if I haven't used in about a week, I have to go out to my vehicle and program the address about 30 minutes before I leave to make sure the satellites have been acquired.Suction cup doesn't like to hold.Other than those little things, I absolutely love it."
1,Do NOT buy this; here's why,"I'm writing this as of Dec. 1, 2006. If you are considering a portable GPS navigation system, do NOT consider the Garmin i5 or any other GPS that does not use the new SiRF III GPS signal receiver. (The only exception is Sony's NAV-U GPS systems, which use a proprietary receiver that's actually even better than the Indian-made SiRF chips).Any GPS you consider buying (except the Sony models) must have the new SiRF receiver. All the new Garmin models (e.g. all the Nuvi's) do, as do new Magellan and TomTom models. The better receiver makes a world of a difference in signal acquisition and retention. Don't settle for less, period, or you'll be quite frustrated at times.One more tip: stick with a dedicated GPS navigation from a reputed brand like Garmin, TomTom, Sony, or Magellan. Avoid PDA-GPS combos and avoid off-brands like Averatec, Mio, FineDrive, etc. The quality differences are huge. The namebrands are just much better investments, period.Good luck."
4,Garmin StreetPilot i5 Automotive GPS Navigator,"I wish I would have purchased the touch screen and the Garmin that provided me with alternative routes to my destination. I am very satisfied with this product, although i wish i would have upgraded this Garmin gets me where i need to go. I love it! I cant imagine life without him now!"
5,If you hate getting lost - order this ASAP,"A friend of ours had one and let us borrow it for a week - we had to get our Garmin - it was so helpful, and we truly love this little addition. Small/easy to read/program... Great product all around!"
1,"Straight Up, I hate this product and here's why","It worked fine in the start and then it couldn't stopped working. I checked the batteries and it still didn't do anything for me. I'm glad I brought this from a great company like Amazon though. I got my refund, so I feel good about that at least."
2,Street pilot I5,I did not like the street pilot. Everything was done with the thumb wheel. If you have large hands or a hard time with your hands it is not for you. It was not really user friendly. We actually had one that was malfuntioning as well which made it that much harder to work with.The screen was really small as well.As for Garmin products it would be nice to be able to program addresses into the navigator through the computer as well. This particular model would not even allow that to be done.
4,Does the job at a great price,"I had this unit for a little over two months now and I can say nothing but good things about it. The Garmin I5 sells for a great price for a pre-loaded unit with all the states on it and I believe it still ships for free on Amazon.I have used the Garmin I5 a lot in the time I have had it and it has always worked as it should. If you need to stray from your route, it will simply tell you it is recalculating and give you another way to get there..no problem...it even told me to make a u turn when I passed up my destination and we all got a good laugh out of that.We have friends that paid nearly $4,000 for a GPS factory installed in their Infinity and they can't take it with them when traveling and having to rent a car or when using a different vehicle..the Garmin can be taken anywhere and it will get you to your destination just as good as the $4,000 unit will.I would recommend this Garmin I5 or the I3 (which doesn't have the states preloaded)without hesitation."
2,Garmin i5,The Garmin i5 is reasonably precise but the size of the screen is very small.The voice feature on my i5 failed. Garmin has a limited technical service staff and the telephone waits often exceed 1/2 hour.
5,Great GPS,"I bought the GPS for my girlfriend who is a visiting nurse, she loves it and no longer gets lost."
5,GARMIN I5 GPS,"This unit is so easy to use and you just can't get lost. If you make a wrong turn the unit recalculates and gets you back on the correct route. I took it to Montreal Canada to visit a relative in the hospital in downtown Montreal. This unit brought me right to the doorsteps of my uncle's home. Since I couldn't get out of Montreal the same way I came in because of turn restrictions and road work, I set the unit on ""get me home"". I didn't even have to look for street signs, the unit directed me out of Montreal without any worries. It's so much easier to listen to the unit tell me when to turn then to keep looking for the next exit or turn. It's easy to program and even out of the car, it is small enough to fit in my pocketbook for strolling through the city."
1,I took one look at it when I opened the box and I returned it,"This product is accurately described, but the picture was deceiving. It is much smaller in person (the screen is only like 1.5 inches) and the plastic quality looks cheap. I wasn't pleased at all and opted for the NUVI 360, instead. Bear in mind, I did not actually use the product. It just didn't look like something my husband would have liked, so I returned it, unused. Not a bad buy for less discerning tastes."
3,I returned it,Not fair to rate it as I returned it. It was an impulse buy and really wasn't in my budget.
4,Great product for the price!,"I wanted to buy my husband a GPS for Father's Day. All the producta I looked at were so expensive that I was about to find something else. Then I found the Garmin and was so excited about the good reviews and lower price. So far it has been great. It has gotten us everywhere we have needed to go. I already recommended it to other people to buy. There are a few things that are a little strange. For example they are still showing FLEET banks instead of Bank Of America....I think the switch was a few years ago already. But as for directions, it has not gotten us lost."
1,Product great; amazon sent a lemon,"I tried this product over Christmas. My brother owns one and i liked it so much that i ordered my own right away. It arrived today, but unfortunately for me, Amazon sent a lemon. Unit would not start up. So i sent back and asked them to overnight one to me immediately. We'll see if they follow through. While I can vouch for this GPS, I can't say the same for Amazon's customer service department. By the way, they don't print the phone number on the website, so if anyone has a similar experience in the future, here's the Customer Service # at amazon: 800-201-7575."
2,Street Pilot i5,"I think the system is good. However I feel the screen is way to small. I wish I had gone to a store to look at this in person before I ordered it. If I had i would have spent the extra money and got the bigger screen. It is very hard to see the directions on top of the screen. It is also very tough to see the map on the screen. When I buy my next one, it will most likely be a Garmin but with a larger screen"
3,It's works for the most part,"I've had the i5 for about 2 months and it works for the most part. It's simple to use and transport bc of its small size. However, it doesn't work all the time. Sometimes it takes awhile for it to locate satellites or will lose satellite coverage. With mine, it has been acting weird lately. If I had to do it over again, I would buy a higher end one if I had the extra money. But if you have a limited budget, the i5 will do."
4,gave as gifts to two non-tech relatives,"I bought two of these as gifts for my sister down in DC and a cousin in NJ. Both are completely non-technical, but both were able to use the navigators painlessly. The rubber dashboard mount (optional accessory) is very nice for a minivan. If you're accustomed to the old-school full-size StreetPilots, you'll be shocked by how tiny the screen is. Works fine for basic directions and getting voice prompts, not so useful for situational awareness and getting a lot of data at a glance."
4,Good value in this GPS unit,"I already have a Garmin GPS (StreetPilot 2620) unit but purchased this because I wanted one that can be brought onboard a plane in carry on baggage. The 2620 I have is too big to carry with me on a plane since I generally bring my laptop, and I do not want to risk having it stolen from checked baggage.The i5 is a very impressive unit given the size (imagine if a baseball was a cube rather than a ball) and the price. I do find that it takes quite some time to locate satellites after you do not use it for a while, but it works. The directions are good and the screen, though small, is very clear.If you are looking for a basic GPS unit (really no ""bells or whistles"" on this one) that is easy to use, very portable, and affordable, this is the unit for you."
4,Garmin I-5 Street Pilot,"I travel alot for business. I wanted a small portable GPS unit that didn't take up too much room in my briefcase. The I-5 is perfect. Yes a larger screen would be nice, but then it would also take up more room in my briefcase when I travel.Highly recommend for business travlers."
3,Small display,"The display on this product is really small. I would spend the extra money to get a larger display and get a touch screen. It takes some time to enter all the information needed to get your directions. Not many catagories listed either. Once you input your info though, the directions are easy to follow and the ability to listen to the directions is good because you wouldnt want to be looking at the small display screen while driving."
4,Updates?,"I love the Garmin i5, but it does not recognize new streets in my subdivision or new restaurants in the area. I wish there were a way to update this information."
1,unfortunate garmin experience,"I wanted to like the Garmin Streetpilot i5. I found however, that the connection to the lighter was unreliable, and many frustrating times were required to reprogram the unit, which does not ""hold"" the destination in memory when the power goes out. After many frustrating experiences, I tried to contact Garmin, which was in itself a frustrating experience. I vote ""no"" on this unit."
3,Garmin Street Pilot,"It is easy and simple to use but it looses satellite signal and when it does come up it takes about 15 seconds to get back to navigating, and if the turn comes up at the time it has gotten satellite back it will tell u too late and u miss ur turn it can get confusing unless someone else is there to read ahead of time."
3,How to get from point A to point B,"For a relatively low cost point, this GPS device will get you from point A to point B. I bought this device because I never wanted to get lost again. 99% of the time, it has helped to keep me on track.The neatest feature is that you can change the language/accent of the announcer/ direction giver.The downsides are as follows1. Using the pin-wheel to navigate letters/ words is irritating and non-efficient.2. The Garmin easily becomes confused by roads that are parallel to one another and in close proximity - for example, a service road and its major highway counterpart.3. It takes, what I consider, an excessive amount of time to synchronize with its satellite system when first turned on.Even with all the downsides taken into account, given what I paid, I am happy with the product."
2,Way too small,"Although the text accurately described the unit size, the accompanying photo made it look like other Street Pilot devices. When I rec'd the I5 I couldn't believe how small it was. Perhaps good for pocket or purse, but not the car. I promply returned the I5 and purchased a 330. Amazon handled the return and refund promptly."
4,Streetpilot i5 user since October 2006,"The Garmin is easy to use. It doesn't always select the most efficient route, but it will always get you to where you want to go. I agree with other reviewers' comments on the software. I have noted one deficiency that appears to be common to other GPS on the market: It will let me enter the name of a nearby restaurant, but you can't tell it to go find ""Fogo de Chiao"" in a city 30 miles away. You have to locate the restaurant on the internet, then enter the street address into the Garmin.I have had two hardware failures since Oct 2006. (1)I left it on my windshield all summer and the rubber mount melted onto the windshield. A new mount is $30 and a paint scraper is required to get the rubber off the window. (2) Recently the USB connector stuck to the cable, possibly because of corrosion, and when I pulled the cable the whole assembly came out. I had purchased a warranty from NEW and they readily repaired the unit."
3,"Love the product, but defective","I ordered this product (Garmin Streetpilot I5) a couple of months ago. It worked great for a few weeks, but then the 12 volt cigarette adapter cord (for use in the car) broke.The Streetpilot still works with batteries, but they don't last too long. Rather than going through the hassle of returning the item to Amazon or trying to make a warranty claim to Garmin, I first looked into buying a replacement adapter from Garmin. To my surprise, a simple cigarette adapter cord is nearly $40 on the Garmin website.Fortunately, I was able to find a generic adapter that works with this particular model on ebay for about $11. But it was frustrating to have an essential accessory part completely fail within weeks of purchase."
4,Mostly a great product,"Happy with the operation of the unit from out of the box. Other reviewers on the mark about the windshield suction cup - it is ""touchy"" at best; I bought a mount for the dash from WalMart on line to keep it from falling on my lap while driving. Only other problem is with Garmin technical support. In spite of not checking the ""avoid car pool"" box under preferences the unit will not route me on I-66 HOV lanes into or out of DC from Fairfax County. I sent in a ""help"" message to Garmin over two weeks ago and have heard nothing back from them. Overall I'd recommend the unit."
2,bad signal,"Because it kept loosing the signal in the very important spots (like the exit from the HWY) I had to return it and replaced with Nuvi 350, which I very happy with. Also, 350 gives you the name of the street. What I think is very helpful."
4,Love the product but have some frustration,"I'll keep this quick. The product is very good and I love how simple it is to use. I do recommend buying this product but it comes with a warning. I live in chicago amongst the tall buildings and the device cannot pick me up to guide me until I'm in a place with few buildings around. It's OK when I'm in Chicago as I know my way, but it happened to me in Washington,DC."
3,Decent,"Decent for the money, basic, no fancy stuff. Not thrilled with scrolling wheel, but whatever~"
4,Great little gadget,"Small, accurate and easy to use.has all the basics you needcan highly recommend itThe only negative aspect is that the batteries are running out farely quickly"
4,Amazing little GPS,Who knew how much information could be stored in such a tiny form-factor? Now I can't live without this gadget. Just plug it in and go! The only drawback is the small screen (because it is a small device). Otherwise this makes the perfect travel companion.
2,Garmin StreetPilot i5 GBS Navigator,1. The screen was too small to use in traffic.2. It took too long to program. . .it's easier to print out MapQuest info.
4,Don't know what I would do without my Garmin,"I'm new to this area, my new home. I could make it across the country but had a hard time navigating near my new digs. Very simple to use and it even navigates me where I need to go if I make a wrong turn. All I had to do is take it out of the box and put in a few addresses and I was on my way. Nothing to load, it was all in the system. I bought this model as a result of the Consumer Reports very high endorsement. My daughter bought one as well, a little before I bought mine but she is experiencing a little problem with hers. Her Garmin has stopped talking."
4,Great Product,The StreetPilot is probably the most easy to use GPS I've used in quite some time. My father who isn't that savy when it comes to electronics is able to use it with no problem. The only down side is the preloaded maps aren't up to date as you may expect. I tried to put my friends address and it didn't know where it was located.
5,Awesome,"This product is simply awesome! It's a lot of fun driving around with it on. Easy to user, right out of the box - no instructions needed. Great usability testing was done for this product. The voice is clear and the display is crisp and clear even though it isn't a large display."
4,Very good buy for the money,"This is my first GPS and I already bought second one to give as a gift to my Wife.+ ponts:0) PRICE1) Locks on satellite quickly2) Never looses signal, even during heavy rain.3) Route selection is A+4) Finds popular places easily.5) Re-calculates route in seconds,- Points:1) Suction cup does not hold the unit tightly, it fallen off the windshld twice in 1 week. If you apply little water at the base then it remains. Garmin must fix this proble in their next version2)Does not speak street name as well as Exit name/Number.3)Design is not slick."
3,Good GPS,"I purchased this for my girlfriend recently and she loves it. However the one drawback I find with the unit is the thumbwheel which although it is handy, seems to be slower to input an address than with a touch screen. I would spring for the couple extra bucks and get a C330 or C340 if I had to do it over. She is in realestate and when you ahve a lot of addresses to put in, the thumbwheel gets tiresome.The power cord is attached to the unit directly - and so removal from the vehicle required detaching the suction cup each time which is not very fun.One other small drawback is that you have to select the ""State"" every time you put in an address. I would like it to default to my home state - but have not found out how. Documentation does not explain this.Otherwise it works great and takes alot of stress off traveling places. She wishes she had gotten one 2 years ago when she started real estate.Cheers!"
4,Small and Wonderful,"This is the first GPS I have seen thats so small and believe me, it works. It does everything necessary and perfect for the price. There is nothing not required and nothing missing. The wheel/button to input is not at all complicated, but could have been better. I am giving only 4 start coz I also bought a Nuvi350 to use on my motorcycle and Iam gonna give that 5. But for the price.. and for your car.. you aint gonna get lost no more. For its size, its gonna surprise you. Its a 100times better than Magellan. Buy IT TODAY!."
3,Get a newer model!,"Well, this unit will certainly get you there and I love the compact size (I have the almost identical i3), but I'd just like to warn people away from buying this older, and now discontinued model -- especially at this inflated price. There are newer and more advanced units available for less than 200 these days. Also, the baseball-like shape isn't too pocketable and this doesn't have a touch screen, which will slow you down when you're entering a destination. And since it has been discontinued a while, I doubt that it is loaded with the lastest maps."
2,Garmin BRAND mean NOTHING,"This Product is GOOD for $99.00...........Not for $325.99 as I bought for. There are Product from Mio c310x for $250.00 which do Amazing Work as GARMIN high end product which Cost around $600.00. Anyway DON'T Buy GARMIN i5 Street Piolot, this is ONE of GPS GOOD for NOTHING, You will be DEAD before You FIX YOUR DESTINATION, too TOUGH to KEY IN ""WHERE YOU WANT TO GO""."
4,street pilot,"The screen display is small but the device does what it has to, get you from point a to point b. I will be buying a new car and was thinking of having it equipped with a dealer supplied gps. After using this product and paying less than 400 dollars, I wouldn't think of having a dealer provided system."
5,"Great quality, runs big, good buy for the $","The size runs truer to size than most costumes so it was big on my daughter, but I was able to put a black undershirt underneath and pin up the length. I just used the belt to hide the bunched area I had pinned. Quality construction, I did have to resew the finger elastic on one wing but that's because my daughter was chewing on it, lol. And the jewel fell off the choker medallion, but I super glued it back on and it stayed on after that. She will be able to wear it again next year if she wants, and even if she doesn't I will save it in case she wants to wear it the following year!"
4,Cute,"My 9 year old has worn this to Boo at the Zoo, Costume night at a Pizz Buffet and is wearing it again tonight to trick or treat.It has held up remarkably well.The wingy things don't drape this well and they appear more solid black in real life.She complained that the collar was itchy.I recommend it."
3,Costume - large,"This costume was quite large for the sizing. Bonus, my daughter plans to wear it again this year."
1,Disappointing...,"Unfortunatly I didn't learn much of anything about Pit Bulls that I didn't already know. I guess if you had absolutely no knowledge of the breed you may find it interesting. Example from the cover ""Maintain your Pit Bull's optimum health with this essential diet"" The answer on the dvd was ""feed a high quality diet""."
4,I came late to the party,"but there is still a lot on the table.Don't know how I missed this guy, and am making up for lost time...Favorite 'new artist' category, for me, but this guy is solid...and no rookie."
5,Brown Color Story,"My students were (almost) salivating at the cover of this book - I was too! That chocolate looked so yummy! This book was another wonderful addition for the set of 8 I purchased for my classroom for ""Color Week"". The photographs are wonderful & the text is the correct length for the 3-5 year olds I teach. The pictures sparked lots of discussion about the brown items pictured & sparked lots participation while we made our own chart of brown items. I enjoyed reading these - & rhyming text is always good. Even if the children don't recognize it at first, I remind them about words that ""Sound the same at the end"" & we listen for them! This whole set is a great addition to my classroom library & I highly recommend them for any parent or teacher of young children."
5,"Zee Best ""indie"" CD around","Zee and Zoe's Piano After Dark is a great album. A nice CD to add to your collection. My Favorite tracks are ""Lua Nua"" (Naked Moon) and of course Paino After Dark. This CD defines Smooth Jazz at it's best. I can't wait to listen to the follow up album Piano After Dark II!"
2,"I give them a ""C"" for effort","This movie had an okay story line, but ultimately it was very low budget and poorly done."
1,HUH???,"Not sure what movie the other reviewer watched, but all I can say is the movie was pointless. One word sums it up GAWBAGE!"
1,"Not an ""Echo""","I agree with 'Jason and Lisa' who gave this CD 5 stars about Ms. McCall's talent. In fact, I bought ""Slumber"" after buying her 1998 work, ""Jana McCall"" and liking it more and more with each playback. Sadly, Slumber fails to echo the earlier work. The only tune that worked for me (if I may be just a bit too cute about it) is a re-make of Echoes -- originally by Pink Floyd. From the credits, it looks like Ms. McCall did less work with Aaron Lundborg on this CD. She definitely has great talent but he may be more in tune on how to use it."
1,Not Worth the money or time,"This movie was the worse 11.67 that I have ever spent. It is a low budget movie, Poor acting, boring and absolutely NO plot whatsoever! It centers around a ""so-called"" Beat Master who is supposely comprising the ""Dopest"" beats at their so called Battles at various clubs. In the movie you hear about 1 minute of the beat and then a winner is determined. The title gives the illusion of a Step Dance Theme when in fact it has NOTHING to do with Stepping at all. I was so disappointed that I fast forward in hopes some action was going to appear. Whoever produced this movie needs a serious butt kicking and should be ashamed that they are duping consumers out of their money with false titles as ""Step Off"" This butthole probably doesn't even know the meaning of the term ""Step Off"". I wasted 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back not to mention 11.67 on this piece of crap. Run don't walk away from this one!!!"
3,David Lanz in typical form,"I've just recently started listening to his playing and I do wish he would branch out a bit. This is not as good as His ""Christmas Album"" but he does a creditable job. He does need to branch out more and do some less known work than these old standards."
3,This cd did a good job of highlighting christmas carols,This cd has really been a joy to listen to. I puts special emphasis on our most holy songs for the season. This cd is a must for solo piano fans. It is perhaps one of the better Christmas cds around.David did a marvelous job with this cd. He knew when to play and when to pause the song. His feel for these songs was real genuine and heartfelt. I feel like David really knows about the meaning of Christmas and the need to perform these songs in a special way.The only thing I didn't like about this cd was the original music that David used. I have never been a fan of comtempory music and this cd is no exception.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd. It really fits the spirit of Christmas.
2,Too Much Filler,"Out of 300 pages, not more than 20 are filled with the casino war stories, behind-the-scenes glimpses, and interesting anecdotes that are Vegas. Martinez fills most of the pages with odd sideline stories and flashbacks that have nothing to do with the real Las Vegas. My guess is that he spent all his time in Vegas partying instead of writing and upon returning to NY, not being able to remember many of the salacious facts, just filled in the pages with fluff.The ""Man with the $100,000 Breasts"" is a better read if, like me, you're looking for the fun casino war stories."
3,"Read it for the experience, not how to gamble","As a certifiable Vegas junkie, I got a kick out of this book. The author takes a $50,000 bankroll supplied by his publisher as an advance to write the book, so he goes to Vegas to gamble (research) and write the book... with me so far? Not bad work if you can get it!It's rather fun to follow the highs and lows of this gaming novice as he starts to catch on to the comp system, games offered (good and bad), and the general casino scene, all related first person.OK, so the author doesn't have H.S. Thompson's biting sarcasm, but the prose flows smoothly, the anecdotes are amusing, and, to no ones surprise given his limited gaming knowledge, looses most of the advance. It's just so much fun having him tell it.Again, not a gaming ""how to"" book, not a ""how to get comps"" book, just a gool ol' wild west experience."
2,24/7 : Living It Up and Doubling Down in the New Las,"I was very eager to read this book when I first heard about the subject matter. What a great idea , go to Vegas with $50,000 and write about your gambleing exploits. We get about 40% of that in this book and the rest is devoted to history lessons or the author and his wife having dinner with friends or visiting the hoover damn. What a great concept that failed to meet my expectations in the gambleing and casino department."
4,A Great Read for a Vegas Junkie,"As an inveterate Vegas junkie, I could hardly put this book down. Mr. Martinez captured the heart and soul of modern Las Vegas and blended it with just the right amount of history, all the time keeping the reader enthralled with the mystery of just how well he was eventually going to make out. The best book about Vegas I have ever read."
4,Almost a winner!,"From a guy like myself who will never gamble beyond the paltry allowance I allow myself to loose per day - I have always wondered what it would be like to experience Vegas as a high roller or ""whale.""24/7 gives the reader a chance at this, following the ""nice guy"" author with $50,000 through Vegas - he takes us not only to the best hotels but also the local areas and clubs. Quite the tour. Along the way you experiene with the author the ability to get ""drunk"" with the gambling, trying to recoup the lossed until you realize you've been up all night! I'm glad to experience this through Mr. Martinez instead of with my own cash!The only downfall for me was the book lost steam near the end as the author looked for an ending."
5,Kudos from New York,"While I must admit that I'm not the gambling type, 24/7 had me completely addicted. It's a highly amusing chronicle of the author's adventures in Las Vegas and of the colorful characters he comes in contact with along the way. Martinez portrays the people he meets with respect, regardless of their position in life. You end up really liking him, with his humorous, down-to-earth style and his quirky references to his cat Trotsky and his practical wife Kathy back home. The book also has suspenseful moments when Martinez gets more and more into the gambling himself. After reading it, I'm actually thinking about going out to Vegas myself sometime to check out the mega hotels he describes so vividly and to experience all else the city has to offer."
5,Almost as Good as Scoblete,"Martinez is almost as good as Frank Scoblete. What is the difference between the two? Scoblete knows how to play to win! He doesn't waste his time just relying on luck but actually knows techniques called advantage-play techniques so that when he writes his diary entrees in his books Guerrilla Gambling and Best Blackjack you know you are getting a glimpse into a master gambler. And Scoblkete really knows how to handle dialogue in a way few authors or even novelists can. However, Martinez is a really fine writer as well and his book does make Vegas come alive. I do not, as other reviewers who have panned the book, think that Martinez's book is a waste of time. On the contrary, it is a fun journey. It's just that Scoblete has been over this territory before and has done it much better. But I do recommend the book nevertheless."
5,Fascinating!,"This book is great for a nonfiction account of the powers of Las Vegas. It's perfect for those who the city and often daydream about the concept of lving in all the hotels with seemingly unlimited money. It touches upon everything-the intricities of gambling, and history, with some stories of natives interspersed throughout. And all along there is a great writing flow that makes you root for this guy. Beware though, this is not a guide, there are enough of those out there."
5,The Best YET!,"This book could not be better! I have been to Vegas only once but,Andres told the story of casinos nation wide.This book could have took place in Biloxi,Atlantic City,Reno, etc.,etc.,I hope they make a movie about it.The author is from a background that is foreign to me but, I felt like I knew him."
3,"Great Premise, great Writing, but story drags on.....","I just read this book after it being recommended by a dealer. I play pretty high stakes baccarat and BJ and when in Vegas live those crazy hours. I was extremely excited when I first bought the book and read the plot outline and the first few pages. However it begins to drag on far too long when he spends time with people like conventioneers. It is pretty surprising that he had such wild swings in his bankroll, at times he'd be down 10-20 grand and come back with a couple thousand dollars left. There wasn't enough about a ""wild time"" in Vegas in my opinion, it seems his stay while nice because his free bankroll, was fairly dull in many ways."
5,Absolutely Amazing!,I loved the heroine and hero in this book they were so perfect for one another and I totally fell in love with Derek Craven! :)
5,best romance ever!,best romance I have read to date. she does the tortured hero better than any other book has done. you will not be able to put it down. would give it more stars if i could.. definitely will keep forever.
4,Thoroughly Enjoyed it!,Wonderful read for a cozy afternoon. This was my first book by Ms. Kleypas and for sure I'll be buying more of her novels.
2,could not finish it,"this book started out really really good but then it just fizzled.i can't even remember the last third part of the book even though i skimmed through it yesterday.if you are reading the first chapter on you kindle,you will be tempted to buy it but don't."
1,"Where's the action, where's the story?","I bought this book because of all the positive reviews, but I was very disappointed. I like a story line, more than just two people finding each other, and doing it. I thought that Sara was vain and immature and Derek missed the mark with me too, by sleeping with the woman that looked like Sara, therefore showing his love for Sara, PLEASE! Add stupid to Sara for believing that zinger.There was no real story appeal here, just primping, posturing, drinking and other immature, silly attention getting stuff that made me not like either Sara or Derek."
4,Another Winner By Lisa Kleypas!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the story of Sara, a simple country maid who is also a published author, and Derek, the scandalous owner of a very successful gambling club.After Sara saves his life, Derek reluctantly agrees to allow her to visit his club to further her research for her latest novel - as long as she agrees to stay out of his way! Needless to say, Sara's is a much noticed presence as her sweet, charming ways manage to captivate the staff...and Derek.This is a beautiful story with many interesting secondary characters such as Derek's scorned mistress, Sara's coddled fiance, and the inhabitants of Craven's.I highly recommend this book!"
5,A great read!,This was my first Lisa Kleypas novel and I enjoyed it so much that it certainly won't be my last. Loved the characters and the story.I highly recommend it.
5,I don't tumble house wenches but I'll take this one...,"To sum it up: A very entertaining read featuring one of the most endearing male protagonists and an awesome heroine.Read this book if you haven't already!Lisa Kleypas excels in this novel in creating a story that will draw you in and make you smile.I did (smile) when Derek gives in to the teasing of the house wenches and pulls his wife from amidst them and says ""I'll take this one""Five stars!"
5,A one-day read!,I bought this book based on the fabulous reader and author recommendations. I don't see too many Kathleen Woodiwiss (the all-time best) recommendations on book covers so for that reason alone I was intrigued with this book. I am extremely happy to report that the hype was well-deserved. Derek and Sara are perfect for each other. My heart ached for Derek's past life and I felt a kinship with Sara. When they finally got together I felt all mushy inside. :) This one is definitely going on my keeper-shelf.
5,Too Good!!,"This book might possibly be too good. I don't think I'll read anymore romance for awhile because I'm afraid all other books will suffer in comparison. It will be hard to find books that top this one. I never write reviews but every once in a blue moon a book comes along that stays with you forever. After the hours of enjoyment this book gave me , I feel it deserves applause. I hope I can find more incredible reads out there like this one!! If anyone loved this book and knows of similar books to recommend, please let me know. I'd really appreciate an email (...)Thanks!..."
3,Not very memorable,"This is a book that you read and forget in the next moment. There is nothing about it that makes you remember it. And honestly, I don't even remember enough to write a decent review :("
2,What a boring book!,"Is it just me or is this book genuinely boring? I'm glad I read Ms. Klepas' Suddenly youSuddenly Youbefore this, otherwise I'd never have given any of her books another chance!"
3,Don't know what everyone liked about it,"I read quite a bit and I will have to say I bought this book because of the high reviews. I am very disappointed.It Starts of good but as you continue to read it gets too drawn out. Yes, I got the point how Derek couldn't say "" I love you"", how many times does that have to drag on. Yes, he thinks he is not good enough for her.And I got the point that they loved each other in the bedroom, everytime the book went into that it hadto explain how he unbuttoned her top, felt her skin, etc. I get the picture! Where is the depth of the story. It is written like a bad ""B"" rated movie.Sorry everyone Hated it!"
2,dont buy this book . waste of money,the love story began halfway thru the book. and cant imagine that sarah was beautiful. it made no sense why derek was in love with her.didnt really feel that derek and sarah had chemistry. im dissappointed.
2,"Boring book, who says that it was difficult to put it down?","For those who read and told that it was a highly exciting book, I really want to wring their necks, I spend money and read a very boring story. What was so good in this story anyway? The only thing that I was interested in, was to know what happened later to that annoying mother-in-law to be (she is very realistic). Other than that, I will not recommend this book, nothing unusual there that kept my attention. I loved Lisa Kleypas's Again the Magic (wow, you need handkerchiefs, that story was like one of Judith Mcnaught books).I expected too much from this book and nothing, no chemistry here."
2,Don't waste your time....,"I don't know where to begin. I bought this book looking for a new author because of all of the previous good reviews and have never been so disappointed in a read. I am a huge fan of Judith McNaught, LaVryle Spencer, Sara Donati, Diana Gabaldon, Shana Abe, JD Robb, Julie Garwood..etc and I guess I have pretty high standards after reading their works. This was the fist book I have read by the author and I don't plan on reading any more. The plot was thin and the characters were barely even developed enough for the reader to form any kind of opinion of them. I'm a romantic at heart and enjoy a great love story but this book was not worth my time or money."
5,A masterpiece!,"I reread this book again recently and all I can say is this is the best love story I have ever read in our modern Historical Romance genre. All of Lisa's books are wonderful but this one can simply not be touched. There is something about the characters (especially Derek) that touches the soul. If you haven't read it, buy it. You will never forget it."
5,If I could I'd give it six stars!,"This is one of the best romance novels I have ever read. There's no way I've read anything better, and believe me, I read constantly.Derek Craven is the most hopelessly charming romantic hero I've yet to encounter, simply by virtue of the fact that he thinks he has no virtue. He's classically tortured, and Sara is perfect for him. The plot doesn't move too slow or too fast, it doesn't drag in the middle or during that dangerous last quarter of the book. Unlike with some romance novels, at no time is the impression given that the relationship between Derek and Sarah is based on the physical. The attraction is always a matter of one having what the other needs and yearns for--emotionally--and it goes both ways.I loved this book.READ IT!"
1,Poor Customer Service,"If you got the package on time or earlier, then you are lucky.I told the Customer Representative that I haven't received the package, since it was supposed to arrive last week. He then questioned me ""are you sure you didn't get it""? And even told me to ask all my neighbors (I have 100 neighbors) if they got my package & call him back!! He keeps on saying to ask my neighbors and check, as if it is my fault that the package got lost!"
1,I it not good,"I thought its will be nice but it is not good at all.It is just one day then you have to tied it again , one day more then swing again. Its never be good until you through it away. If you did bought it yet then dont buy it."
1,The coat tree instructions don't make any sense.,"There are so many pieces! I'm pretty smart, but the end product eluded me. I'm returning and hoping to get a refund including shipping both ways. I'm not sure but I think it's missing some pieces. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone."
4,Great product,This is sturdy and nice. I like that it has many hooks. The top looks different than what was portrayed.
3,Not bad,"Looks nice, plenty of hooks, all in all it is satisfactory for the length of time I plan on using it for. However no matter how I arrange the coats or tighten the bolt it leans to the side. Shipping price and length was a bit ridiculous and unexpected when just looking at the rack on the website. If you are Amazon Prime member just beware that the Prime not applicable to this product!"
2,Black Coat Rack,"Although attractive, there is a design flaw in the connection to the base of this coat rack. Once assembled, it is unstable, rocks, and does not stand straight. I am very disappointed and am hoping my son-in-law can fix its instability."
4,coat rack as promised,"This coat rack is just as described.. Great finish. ... Love the ""arms"" that are lower down so my grandson can reach them."
4,Why I liked it,"This is very handy, light weight,easy to move and you can purt any corner of your house and I like the material it made of."
2,Meh,"This coat rack does the job, but in a wobbly way. It could not accommodate my partner's heavy army coat (it immediately started leaning to the side and has been crooked since.) It can hold lighter coats, but I don't expect it to last very long. The instructions are also not very clear, at least as far as the base is concerned. The manufacturer could have put 5 more minutes of thought into coming up with a design that wouldn't collapse as easily."
5,Love it!,Love the coat rack! Been looking for a reasonably priced coat rack. Needed something metal because I want to use it in the house during the cold months and outside by the pool as a towel hanger during the swimming months. I love the design on top. It really gives the coat rack a decorative flare.
1,Stay way from this...,"Poorly built, the stand has no stability whatsoever. For a couple of overcoats, jackets and overalls, mine just fell off and broke into three pieces. Definitely not safe around kids."
1,"Horible, dont order from ATHOMEMART","I recieved my coat rack about a week after I ordered it, which is fine, but there was no hardware to put it together in the box. I contacted Athomemart and it took them a long time to get back with me, When I did finally get a response they said they would send out the hardware immediatly but they didnt and i waited thinking they are already sent but it never came. About a week goes by so I contacted Athomemart and they said there was some kind of mistake on there part and they are going to send it out right away and give me a refund on the shipping I paid. well another week goes by and i finally get the hardware, but they never gave me a refund. I waited 3 weeks for the coat rack after it was all said and done and they didnt compensate me for it one bit, after they said they were going to. I really doubt they even check there packages before they send them."
3,a little rickety...,"I really like the look of this coat rack, however it is very wobbly and threatens to tip over if the coats aren't hung evenly around the rack."
4,Yep,It was inexpensive and keeps the coats off the floor. :) I would recommend this if you're not looking to spend $50+ on a temp coat rack of sorts...
4,Worth the Price!,I have searched online for a nice and affordable coat rack and this one was perfect. I especially like the lower hooks so that my son can hang up his own coat (6yrs old). The only thing I don't like is if I hang most of the coats on one side it tilts over. I have seen more expensive coat racks with a wider base in which case that would not happpen but you get what you pay for and overall I am happy with my purchase.
1,Too Tippy!!,"The coat rack looks nice, was very reasonably priced, (saw same item on another web site for $119.00) but is way too tippy, it will and does fall over rather easily, even when balanced with only a couple light weight items on it."
2,not a fan,"We just needed a temporary coat rack while we lived with my in-laws. While it never did tip over, there were a few close calls after we piled all our coats on them (only about 6 coats). I didn't like my son playing around it as I thought it was going to come crashing down on him. It now resides in a room awaiting disposal as we don't know what else to do with it."
3,coat stand,"Assembly was not difficult, however, the coat stand is quite flimsy. Coats cannot be too heavy or off balanced. If so, the stand will fall."
5,"Great Product, Great Price!","I am fully satisfied with this product. It was easy to put together and holds all my purses, hats, scarves and jackets without wobbling or falling over. It is a really exceptional coat rack for the price."
5,Nice coat rack for the price,"This coat rack went together really easily and is holding TONS of my son's jeans and shirts ~ No problems with this product, and it is on wobbly carpet in our basement... and I was pleased with its affordable price."
3,not so impressive,"while the buying experience had no issues, the product did. The round stubs at the end of the arms of the rack do not fit tightly. in fact they are useless. One may see that as a cosmetic issue. But for such a simple product, I would expect things to be working as expected."
2,Decorative cap pieces are a choking hazard!,"The rack itself is pretty good. Easy to assemble, has 12 hooks. However, the small plastic decorative pieces are a serious chocking hazard. They are the size of unsliced, pitted olives, and look close enough to olives that an adult might even try to eat one. And to boot, they don't stay on well at all... about 1/2 of the times you go to pull a coat off the rack, one of these ""olives"" goes bouncing around my living room. Terrible design in that regard. As they fall off, I am just throwing them away. They don't really add much to the aesthetics of the coat-rack anyway..."
1,it is not stable!!!!!,"No matter what I do, I can't make it stable. It wobbles and wobbles.Read other reviews and don't buy this piece of junk!"
1,A Piece of Junk !,"This was assembled with some difficulty and we found that the top part did not fit properly. The paint was chipping all over the top part and the frame was unsteady. It seemed like a used and returned item to us. But since we had gone through the trouble of assembling the whole thing,decided to use it for the holidays to see if it would at least serve its purpose. But after using it JUST ONCE to hang a couple of jackets, the top hook is breaking and is about to fall off. Not sure how people have rated this 5 stars and given such great reviews. So far I always trusted the amazon reviews, now I am beginning to doubt the authenticity of the "" Amazon Verified Purchases "" reviews !!!Want to return this and get my money back, but the prospect of taking it apart is awful !"
5,Very Sturdy,Great for the money. I have hung so much stuff on this and it hasn't even tried to tip over. Even if I don't have it balanced. The only negative is that the balls on the ends of the hooks always fall off.
3,does the job but not flawlessly,constructed this a few days ago and found that the areas where the 3 rods that give it height attach together are not very secure. They are pretty wobbly at those points. The base is sturdy but I couldn't get it to be sturdy at the mid-points.
2,Nice looking product terrible quality,i read all of the reviews on this and decided to go ahead and order this coat rack. We put the rack together and it instantly broke at the bottom stand. We did not even get the chance to hang any items on it to see how it would handle. I DO NOT recommend this product for anyone. The style is really nice and modern but the quality of the item is TERRIBLE!
2,Rusty,This is a poorly made coat rack. Two pieces were slightly rusted when they arrived. The legs were slightly bent. The top knob is crooked. There are parts that were not completely painted. After assembly it wobbles. And it just looks cheap. I question how many coats it can actually support without collapsing under the weight.
3,cheap,Price reflects stand. Looks great but does not stand level. Using duct tape on one leg to keep it standing.... luckily we put it where the legs are not viewable. Should have returned it.
3,Ok for the price,"One part was missing, which was not that big of a deal as it was one of the caps on a hook. It does hold a lot of coats though."
3,kinda Janky,easy assembly... but was missing few knob protectors. Still gets the job done. Has a jankey look to the piece.
4,Very Nice,Coat Rack/Stand in Satin Black Metal Spider StyleThis is really nice with the exception of the balance. It has to have a fairly equal amount of weight on each side to keep from tipping. What I am really impressed about is the customer service. I received defective hardware for the tips of the hooks that didn't fit correctly. I contacted the seller with the problem and in about 2 weeks received another complete package of hardware via Fedex. I will absolutely continue to do business with this company for my needs and recommend it to others. The product is just as important to me as the company. Kudos to the customer service and I recommend the company work on a better design for balance.
3,ok,"The rack is ok. You have to make sure the jackets or coats you put on the rack are even, if not they will topple over. I can't see paying more than what the price is."
2,Unstable & Damaged,"Some paint was chipped off the metal. The metal had a dent in it. The coat rack itself is not very stable. Ok for the money, but I would not recommend this product."
2,Shoddy workmanship,"Has lots of little parts, a pain to assemble. Parts are shoddily made and don't fit properly. For example, the plastic ""caps"" for the arms fit loosely and keep falling off.It's a functional item. Order if the price is very good. For $24, this isn't really worth it."
5,Very Nice,"Very nice,elegant looking product for the money. Very easy to put together. My 17 year old son put it together in 10 minutes."
5,"Useful, nice, easy to assemple","This coat hanger is quite nice and easy to assemble. You can easily hang a dozen coats on it. It's sturdy enough to stay stable on wood/carpet floor, yet can be carried off easily as needed."
4,Metal Spider Style Coat Rack,Perfect for the space available in my office and it blends in with all types of decor.
4,Missing a piece....,Missing a small piece. The customer service gal was so very helpful trying to find another part but to no avail. Instead she gave me a discount. It is a little wobbley on my tile floor but it has not fallen over. What do you expect for $25!!!! Thanks for a good product.
3,Adequate,"This coat rack looks good and it was easy to assemble. It's also quite sturdy. I'd say I got a pretty good deal for the price. I currently have two jackets, two belts, and four hats hanging on it. I live in Arizona, so there are no winter coats. But it works exactly for what I need it to work for.So why do I only give three stars?It didn't come complete. It was one screw short, and one of the bulbous covers that go on the ends of the hooks was missing. I was able to find a screw that fit perfectly without having to go to the hardware store, but the only way to hide the missing hook cover is to permanently hang a hat that I'll never wear on it.But you get what you pay for, right? And I think this was a pretty good value at about $23."
3,Coat Rack/Stand in Satin Black Metal Spider Style,Love the style but it is top-heavy and falls over very easily.
4,Great buy for a great price.,"Don't let the light weight of the rack fool you. This thing holds a ton. Rack went together in less than 15 minutes, and has been holding all our winter gear, including a GIANT leather winter coat, multiple parkas sweaters, and bags ever since."
2,Missing pieces,"We received the package in good time, and amazons packaging was good as normal. Though we received the package and it was missing the 4 middle curved bars. I have emailed the company, Coaster Fine Furniture but no response yet. All of the screws and bar toppers for the 4 missing bars came."
2,Unstable,This coat rack is very unstable. The legs don't sit evenly on the floor so it wobbles back and forth and if you put anything on it it falls over.
3,"Looks good, but...","...it's not exactly the most stable thing on the planet. Although assembly was rather straightforward however the small ball things (for the hooks, to prevent damage to your clothing) refused to stay on until I hammered them in place by smacking it into the ground. Other complaints include what seems to be an inherent instability in the design. Skewed weight distributions will be very much reflected in a worrying tilt. I'm quite concerned it'll fall over soon enough (though it has yet to do so).Otherwise it's quite an attractive work, and was quite cheap which might speak for the quality of the stand. A good deal nonetheless. It does serve its purpose, even if it seems unstable."
3,As expected,"This coat rack is fine. Because the top hooks aren't very long, it's hard to hang things on the second and third hook without being compressed, and it's hard to access them. Not good on uneven floors because the base is not very wide, but it will do. Just make sure you balance out the coat rack."
3,Good Rack for a fair price,"This rack is a nice rack and fairly stable. However, the rubber caps that cover the ends of the hooks could be better. They don't fit snuggy enough and are prone to be slipped out. However, with the price, I think it this is a nice rack to have, especially for casual use."
2,unstable,I ordered this coat rack for my living room. It was much lighter than I thought it would be and with the decorative top weighing as much as the rest of the coat rack it is very top heavy. Unless I carefully balance out the coats hanging on the rack it will lean and easily tip. All in all I would not recommend this item and I am trying to replace it.
1,Super Wobble,The coat rack was super wobbly due to one of the legs being half an inch shorter then the other three. We decided to toss the legs and find a flat bottom base instead.
5,LOVE IT!,"Extremely easy to put together, looks amazing, CHEAP, and very sturdy. I am very impressed! I would recommend to anyone and already have to some family and friends."
4,It is a tin sig/metal sign,I actually wanted a poster. This turned out to be a metal tin sign. It is very good quality and nice. I just feel they need to edit the description and clarify it is tin/metal.
5,An Exceptional Acoustic Guitarist!,"Billy McLaughlin has that rare combination of technical ability and musicality. Unlike many instrumental guitar recordings, McLaughlin's pieces hold up well to repeated listening. The pieces go beyond the usual rhythmic intricacies and state memorable melodic lines - something all too rare in this genre of recordings."
4,Pure Acoustic,What you will love about this album is the pure acoustic sound. There aren't any other instruments to weather the songs down. It is guitar picking alone that makes this awesome album sound so good. With just the guitar picking it doesn't feel over produced or fooled around with. Just pure acoustic talent. You will lose yourself to this music and before you know it...you will be at the end of the cd. I played this outside today and it just replayed over and over again. This will be one of my summer albums that I keep close at hand. I will be getting more of his music in the future.
4,Great Scanner,"I found this scanner easy to use. I was capturing police calls in my area within 15 minutes of turning it on. The service search feature is super since you don't have to program the channels. Just search the POLICE band and when you get a call push a couple buttons and this frequency is now in scanner memory. Heck, I have been listening in search mode and catching alot of action all around DFW. Of course once you find and store all the channels you can enter scan mode which is faster and you wont miss any action. I am a novice scanner user and recommend this product."
4,Hand Held Scanner,"I enjoy using this product for it`s clarity, ease of operation, and the fair price I paid for it. It involved free shipping and arrived before the projected time. Very satisfied and would recomended to anyone interested in a good product from Uniden and sold and shipped from Amazon.Sincerly, Skokie."
4,"Works really nice, BUT too hard to program","I read the manual over and over but still is hard to use. The reception is not that good but if you use a better anthena, works like the best. Now that I've know how to use it, I'm very happy with it!"
3,Scanner,"This is a good product, but does not measure up to it's advertisement. many services use relay systems that this scanner can not track so you lose most of the call you initially hear."
3,Not for the technologically challenged,"The manual that comes with this is far too difficult for the average person to understand. Even though I have a master's degree in English, I still can't figure out how to use this product. Buyer beware!! Perhaps when my grandchildren come to visit, they can show me how it operates."
3,uniden bc92xlt,Very difficult to understand directions . Programing is hard to understand . The scanner works very well for the knowledge that I have of it . It seems to be of top quality performance wise and works well . Still have problems performing basic functions by following the directions . The scanner reminds me of the early computers that only computer geeks could understand . This would be a great product for the price if the programing were more people friendly like today's computers . Eventually I will master all of it's functions but it is like pulling teeth . If you have a friend that already has this scanner definetly buy it . Let the friend set it up to get you started .
2,For engineers and serious radio geeks only,"If you always thought listening in to the cops and fire departments might be a fun hobby, you don't want to start with this scanner. The included manual assumes an EXTREME level of familiarity with radio technology and scanner terminology. I've read the manual 4 times now, and I still don't know what half the functions on the (poorly designed) keyboard do. If you're sure you want to get into scanning, buy something simpler, and cheaper."
1,Very Easy to Use.... I have changed my tune..,"Its very compact,easy to program.I am gald I purchased this item..I have had different scanners with this one you can't go wrong... At first I liked this but now after having it awhile I have changed.. I can't pick up much.. I thought it was my location but that is not the case where ever I go I still can't pick up anything."
1,Demands hard work.,"If you are looking for a tool to aid you in activating your language, this is not it. Its order is nothing short of chaos. A simple search for another word for ""walk"" set me on a fruitless 10 minute journey through several pages. So complex that it consumes all the time you should be using at constructing your text."
3,Psychological Study guide for YOU!,"Anastasi's orignal textbook is a difficult text book for any graduate student. Ms Urbina simplifies and gives examples of typical exam questions. It reviews the nature of psychological tests, statistical concepts in reliability, validity, item analysis, ability testing, personality testing, and finally a good section on the application of testing.A must for any student of psychology!"
3,Flawed but pretty good,"Overall, I enjoyed reading this book. But what was the point of the ""dead"" rabbit? Why *was* Angel so upset? Do we really need to be reminded every other paragraph that Zack turns Charlie on against her better judgment? And I guess my biggest gripe is that there seemed to be very little actual detection...the murderer confessed before Charlie and co. figured it out.Still, overall, I liked it. I doubt I'll put this series very high on my list of reading priorities, though."
3,Not all there,It seemed like the performers were performing from thier instruments and not thier emotions.In the shadow of thier release HONORABLE SKY it is also good to add to the collection.But it isn't as soulfully impressive.
3,well...,The only reason I bought this book was for a class and even then it wasn't very helpful. Not the book's fault just so you know.
1,Untrustworthy Seller: Portions of Book Completely Unusable,Condition of the book was grossly misrepresented by the seller. On the outside it looks like a gently used book. On the inside from page 47-71 there is a large hole ripped out of the middle of the pages. This damage makes most of these pages unreadable. It looks like a previous owner tried to tape the pages with limited success.
1,Do Not Use,"Ordered and paid for 5th edition, this seller sent 4th edition. Would not refund difference."
5,Very great condition.,Good timing with the delivery. Great condition. My philosophy professor recommended this book and his incredibly knowledgeable. Looking forward tot his read.
3,My mistake,"Make sure your professor wants you to purchase this OR the non-concised version. I ran into this problem, and ended up having to get both because in the beginning of the semester the Bookstore only told me ""Ethics: Theory and Contemporary Issues"" just watch out. Clarify before you buy."
4,A great text for ethical issues,"As a student, I found this text to be very confusing to understand, especially the section about ethical theory. This is where supplemental material is essential to have. Some of the articles in the text are very academic as they were written at an upper grad level. Also, the author kept repeating the same things in different ways, which would further confused me, and the issues could have been labeled better. The positive aspect to this text is that it does a great job covering many issues. I'm going to keep this book for the section on ethical issues alone."
3,Good for the price.,"Avon Glimmersticks is affordable, comfortable and lasts well. It glides on thick, so the product won't last super long, and the product is also a bit fragile and prone to breakage. I was a bit disappointed that something called ""glimmer""sticks didn't have any glimmer or shimmer to it. The color is mostly matte with a slight, slight sheen, maybe. But if you want a product that is affordable and feels nice and are OK with a basic color, this is a good product."
4,My favorite Avon product,"I tried this eyeliner when I was 19. That was, um.... a while ago. Since then I've tried many other brands, and this is still my favorite. It glides on nicely without poking or pulling. I had Lasik a year ago, so I really appreciate that now! This liner is good for a soft, natural, smudgy look. If you are looking for a black liner or a defined line that stays put, I would go with a liquid eyeliner instead. I have dark brown eyes & medium skin, and my go-to look is a gray or purple smoky eye and an understated lip gloss. Their gray and purple blend into the shadow well to intensify the color without making it harsh. And it makes my eyes themselves look pretty darn good, too. As far as wear, I think it does pretty well in the northern US, but not so much in the humid south. To be fair though, I couldn't get anything to stay on my face during a Hot Springs summer."
2,not very good,"I bought this for the convenience of not having to sharpen. I have a similar product from Clinique, but this pales in comparison. This eyeliner was too dry. The color didn't apply well so it wasn't dark enough. Even if I use more pressure, it results don't improve. Liquid eyeliner is better than this. Otherwise, if you opt for a pencil, get the kind that you have to sharpen."
1,Avons eyeliner gimmick!,"I was introduced to Avon through a friend who sells it. I really wanted a superior product and there prices seems fair, checked out reviews and made purchase. I purchased Avon Glimmer stick in black and brown. I bought it from an avon store. I must say Im disapointed. I mean the stick breaks off easy (im gentle and dont even use it everyday), didnt even last 6 months. I had the SAME experience with the mascara, all of a sudden one day I went in to use it and it was broken.(how does mascara break) Not even 6 months of use."
4,It's nice,This is like any other eye liner that I've ever used. But this one really makes your eye liner with a deep color.It's easy to apply and works fine for me. It doesn't last the whole day but what eye liner does? I am satisfied with it!
2,Glimmershit,"Doesn't ""glimmer"" or ""shimmer"" at all its flat black. Right when I recieved it I rolled it all the way up to see how much eyeliner I actually paid for. It was 2 inches. Not that much eyeliner for 5.00 plus shipping. I like my maybellene regular wooden eye pencil and will be sticking with that for a while. Not really worth it, if you like this product just find someone who sells it in your area and get it while its on sale for like 2$ free of shipping. :)"
3,Average,"The price is great, but the liner tends to smudge and wear off throughout the day. It does go on very smoothly and it's a great basic addition to your beauty supplies."
4,"its nice, doesnt glimmer","because of the name, i thought it would glimmer but it doesnt. its still is good though. im happy with this product"
3,Avon Eye Liner,"Okay, I bought this eyeliner awhile ago, and I rarely use it. It's relatively cheap, so I guess I shouldn't have asked much.I look like a panda putting on this eyeliner. Just a heads up, it runs. I don't know how it's able to make the claim of being smudge resistant, but by merely blinking I get dark circles around my eyes. I feel like that matchmaker in Mulan.Anyways, I don't really wear make-up that much, but taken into perspective, maybe I just have slippery skin, or maybe I need to learn how to apply eyeliner properly. This is an okay product, I would dare say, considering its price. After all, you get what you pay for. Even though it's not smudge resistant completely, it definitely adheres to your skin for quite awhile. The only downside is when it smears it gives you this disheveled look, like you didn't get enough sleep the day before.I defintely like the twist to apply feature this eyeliner has, and it's slim design is perfect for application. Kudos to that."
3,It all depends,"So I have used eyeliner for a few years now, I have always had issues with getting the eyeliner to stay in place. It always runs on me. So I bought this in black and brown. It was okay it went on smoothy, but it didn't last, after a hour or so it was gone. I also just resently just bought this in a gold. Thinking I could use it as a line on top of the eye lid. Nope, but it works great as a sparkly eyeshadow. Sadly it breaks even if you use it as a regular eyeliner more often then what it should. So over all its okay, it really depends on how you plan on using it and what color."
3,Good,"I bought this in brown and it didn't last all day for me but I have yet to find one that does. Otherwise it was easy to use, glided on smoothly, and the price was very reasonable."
2,Not Impressed,"I'm not a big fan of this product. I love the ""smoky eyes"" look so I thought this product would be exactly what I need. I could barely tell I had it on, which was not the look I was going for. It also smeared a little too much without giving me the look that I wanted. With so many eyeliners on the market, including others from Avon, I wouldn't put this product on my ""must get"" list. However, to be fair, I only tried it in the black so if you are using another color, you probably will want a softer expression - meaning you notice the color without REALLY NOTICING the color. In that case it may work well for you."
2,Avon Eyeliner,I'm giving this product only 2 stars because it made my eyes water really bad. It also doesn't go on as smooth and isn't as dark as I hoped. I also wear contact lenses so having this make my eyes water sucks. I usually wear Revlon or Palladio and I will be going back to purchasing Palladio from Sally's for the same price as this. I don't recommend this to anyone with sensitive eyes.
2,"Not so sure what's so ""Glimmer"" about it.","This eyeliner isn't any different from your local drugstore eyeliner. It pulled on my lash line during application. I'm not completely satisfied but if all you're looking for is a BASIC eyeliner then this is for you (along with all the other ones at your local drugstore). It also dispenses quickly and doesn't seem like it'll last very long.One up point for the stars? It doesn't smudge throughout the day (but again, neither does all my other eyeliners)."
3,Definitely not for me,"I saw that these were inexpensive so and received high reviews, so I ordered. Was very disappointed with it, and I don't use it at all. I won't purchase any again."
2,never came!!!!,"I know that produc is good, but I never came, may be the fault of the mail, but I wrote them to know I could do for do for me to come and they answered that, I spoke with the mail and I really think should be the ones to be communicated not me."
2,Not impressed,"I had worn this color ( Saturn Grey once) when I was in my 20s and unless the formula has changed , I just didn't find it had a very good staying power. Nice colors thou. The idea of not having to sharpen was great but it does not last all day and it does bleed. I bought it once in my 20s and haven't bought it since.To me , color should last and I am talking more than an hour or 2. Try the Make-Up For Ever liners. They are awesome and boy do they stay."
2,size was awful!!,The actual liner is the size of a sample and it looks very pretty on your wrist but does not show up on eye lids.. i would not recommend this. i was referred to this as a cheap alternative to the mac glitter liner but the quality and size was awful!!
1,Is that peanut or mushroom?,"This stuff is terrible. It didn't taste at all like peanut, actually it tasted more like mushroom. Highly not recommended."
5,Best guitar instrumental,"I purchased this CD in 1997 in San Francisco. I love the guitar tones, the arrangements and the performances. After 10 years of not knowing where it could be, I repurchased and still love!!"
5,Stop calling me damaged!,"As a professional who works with young adults who have survived challenging childhoods, and as an adult who has experienced these challenges, I can only say, ""Bravo!"" We've all heard quite enough about the damage done, and not near enough about our incredibly well honed survival skills - what the Wolins named ""resiliencies"". The resilience model gives us a language to use; naming the resiliencies evidenced by a young person is incredibly powerful. Reveiwing my own childhood through this lense is an affirmation and an honor to the child I was and the adult I have grown to be."
4,Complilation,A nice book to add to your library that has most everything he wrote.Having died more than 25 yrs ago makes it all outdated but nice to have all he wrote in one book.
5,Excellent Serice,"Price was very fair, service was excellent, delivery prompt, and merchandise in absolutely perfect condition. What more could I ask for from the seller? Only downside to whole experience has nothing to do with or is the fault of the seller but Amazon.Com persists in sending multiple messages wanting feedback. They ought to recognize the fact that if I'm not complaining I must be happy."
4,Don't be misled by the title!,"This book deals with much more than the title suggests; this is truly Elmer Keith's masterwork, and after reading it you will understand why he was part of the pantheon of America's great gun writers. His laconic & direct style is easy and a pleasure to read. While this book *is* largely about the sixguns the title suggests, there is much more breadth and depth contained within than just that seemingly narrow topic might suggest. To be blunt: I'm an unusually cheap b@st@rd, but consider this book a classic work that belongs in the library of any true firearms aficionado."
4,Informative and historical,"A terrific book. It is still very informative (despite the fact that it is fifty-five years old) and contains useful information on everything from shooting techniques to care and maintanence. Some of it is dated and some of his ideas are not politically correct in 2010, but the book is very readable. In addition it is now a great historical book. It gives you a look at a different time. Highly recommended. Finding it will take some effort and it won't be cheap, but you won't regret buying it. An excellent edition for any shooting library."
5,Nominate Producer Marty Munsch For a Grammy Award,"The New York Rel-X have one of the most outstanding lineups since Becky Bondage joined VICE SQUAD and The Avengers opened for the Sex Pistols at Winterland in the 1970's. The production on this release is so top notch; that you can not find audio quality like this caliber on most recordings post 1989. This is a definitive punk LP representing New York's (and New Jersey) massive and sometimes overwhelming punk arsenal. New York City's premier Marty Munsch has done it for so many bands; I own almost every LP he has dedicated his involvement to; he really knows how to draw the poison out of a venomous animal. A must have for anyone who is serious about punk. He is Pushing the Grammy Awards this time this time and should be at least nominated for one. No wonder they call this guy the ""Phil Spector of Punk-Rock""."
5,Best CD in the last 10 years of punk.,By far the best punk CD in the last decade. Sounds like the Avengers but better.
1,A collection of trailers with truncated films,"This is the oddest DVD: A collection of trailers for various film noir works, weak narrative connecting them, and some VERY truncated pieces of ""DOA"". Unless you want to watch a bunch of trailers, or a VERY edited version of DOA, don't bother."
1,one star is too kind,"Derived almost exclusively from trailers from the worst source prints imaginable, the accompanying serious narrative includes such gaffs as: Raymond Chandler is the author of The Maltese Falcon (a mistake that is made repeatedly); and the plot of Notorious described as: ""a man in love with a scientist's daughter - the scientist is held captive by Nazi collaborators."" I kid you not."
2,WRONG FACTS!!!!!!!,"This video is good for those of us who love Film Noir and want a listing of films that fall under this category. HOWEVER - they got some facts wrong. For instance, in the video they talk about the movie ""The Maltese Falcon"", based on the book of the same name, and how it's central character, Sam Spade, is the quintessential detective. They stated that Raymond Chandler wrote this book. WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dashiell Hammett wrote this book, thus creating the detective Sam Spade. Raymond Chandler created the detective Philip Marlowe, in books such as ""The Big Sleep"". Who edited this movie anyway - did they not check their facts????"
3,the last heist s/have been more!,"""the new jazzy film noir film"" The last Heist""should make quentin tarrintino sit up and take notice!"" he should veiw this good one and take notice and notes! THE CAMERIDERIE AND DIALOGUE IS REAL REAL AND HOMOROUS & GRITTY. VIOLENCE DRAMATIC AND DIFFINETLY NEEDED!"
1,it sucks,This was junk and was missing the pieces. I was to busy with work to send it back. This was the most dissapointed I have ever been with an amazon product. dont waste your money or time
1,All our guns jam with these,We have 4 different guns that these cause to jam. 3 of these are very good quality electric guns and all work fine with other BB's.
1,Be wary of these BBs,So these BBs don't work in my gun. I bought a good AK-47 all metal and metal gear box. Basically because they are not highly polished when the BBs try to feed into the gun from the magazine they get stuck and won't be fired out the barrel. They also don't work in the pistol I have unless you cock it upside down. I would suggest getting Bio BBs that are highly polished. They are the same price and will actually work. If you are interested there are highly polished BBs on [...]
4,A great start to what looks to be a great series!,"I just finished reading DoSF and it is once again a success for Weis and Hickman. I definetly recommend reading the chronicles and legends trilogy before reading it. I give it a four out of five because it is clearly not their best book, it is slow in parts but what book is not? Prepare for a book that almost completely consists of setup for the next two books. Don't expect another Dragons of Summer Flame. It is a different time and a different feel than any of their other DL books. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to more War of Souls."
4,A good read.,"Good plot with lots of room for development in the rest of the series. The characters are not as deeply explored, suplemented by a lot of fluff. Sometimes, from chapter to chapter, you get the sense of the cookie-cutter style of the overal structure of the storyline. But, still a fun read. The ending leaves you a bit in the lurch without much really being resolved. But, I look forward to reading part two to see where the story goes. I would have also liked the story better had the previous heroes/characters been integrated a bit more thoroughly....PS1 Mina = Raistlin | PS2 That's my guess. What is yours?"
3,Good but backstory lacking,I am a big fan of Weis/Hickman and was not disapointed in this book. The only complaint I have is that there is not history or explaination for the Fifth Age in this book. Having been burned by non Weis DL books more than once I had stopped reading anything not writtenby Weis and Hickman. So going into Fallen Sun I had no idea of who these dragons were or what was going on. A timeline or a compacted synopsis of the Post Chaos War years would have helped.
1,"This bit, put simply.","I read the first and second series when it came out, and visited this series with excitment... only to be disappointed.This is a lukewarm rehashing of some really great books. It has none of the oomph, and instead reads like one of hickman's crusade against the occult speeches.Do yourself a favor, and instead just reread the first 6."
4,a good book,A good book one of the better of their books. I like jow they bring back tas.Their are alot of unexpected turns in this book.
4,"Very good, when is the next one comming out?",I was very impressed with this book. I have been reading these books for about 8 or 10 years now and i never seem to get tired of them. As it stands I'm on my third time throuhg this book its self. I like the fact the uncle Tas is back and the intro of those new charcters also is done quite well. Even those who walk the path of darkness will be happy to know that their buddy Rast is even hinted at a come back. I can not hardly wait until the next installment is released.
5,"A good start, requires some background","I just finished this book inside of two days and enjoyed it immensely. It definantly lives up to what have become my expectations for the masters Weis and Hickman.On the other hand, it would no be a good introductory work into the Dragonlance Series: I would not have found it nearly as enjoyable if I had not read some of the other series before this one (the only ""must read"" beforehand, however, is Chronicals Trilogy).All in all an excellent read, highly recommended."
4,Delightful.,"I was suprised, no..stunned, to find a well-written and very enjoyable book in the Dragonlance series. I'd never read Dragonlance before. I've always assumed it's low-quality hack-and-slash advertures. Boy was I wrong.This Dragonlance book is well-written, exciting, and best of all has fascinating characters. I loved reading about the kender, Tasselhoff Burfoot. Page 377 has delightfully offbeat descriptions of a gnome and a hedge maze that reminds me of Douglas Adams. Hilarious.I enjoyed this book more than any other book I've read in recent months. And I read a lot. I've read so-called serious books by Patrick O'Leary, John Barnes, William Gibson, Tom Holt, Neil Gaiman, etc but this was better than all of those. I could go on and on about this book. I loved it and will certainly be keeping my eyes peeled for more Dragonlance in the future."
3,"Good, But also bad","THis is a great book, but Krynn in this book reminds me of a house you have moved out of. All the walls, doors, and windows are still there, but the furniture is moved around, and different people live in it. Krynn has the same geography as it did in the chronicles pretty much, but without the gods to influence things and most of the characters we know gone, its like I said, the moved out of house. The part that especially saddened me was the Tower of HIgh Sorcery formerly of Palanthas. It was surrounded by the shoikan grove, housing the most powerful wizard who ever lived. Full of Potential. but now, all the artifacts inside the Tower drained of magic, the shoikan grove gone, and the tower in disrepair, it is just saddedening. ALmost nothing can happen from there. But I have read lster in the trilogy and it gets way better. My advice, tough it out, and get to the good later books."
4,mina i've crossed oceans of time...............,Love the new story to an excellent epic saga but I was left.... wanting . Which is good but i felt the first 2 books should have been one BIG book. Would have made more sense.
5,Dosn't reach the usual Weis-Hickman standard,"This book isn't as good as the rest of the Weis and Hickman Dragonlance Saga. In the matter of fact, most of the time it doesn't reach the standard of any of their books that I've read. Why 5 stars then? Well, it's Dragonlance and it's Weis and Hickman. They are still great storytellers that make you eager to turn the page, even when the plot is relatively weak. Another thing that's puahing you forward is, as I said, the fact that Krynn is your favorite world, and you enjoy just being in it. I do recommened this book, even if only as a bridge to the other 2 books in the series, which are great."
3,Good but not up to the quality of Legends or Chronicles.,"Though this book is a must read for any Dragonlance fan that wants to know what happened after the Chaos War, it lacks a number of elements that earlier books like Chronicles, Legends, The Doom Brigade, and even The Soulforge contained. Most of the characters come off as dry and one-dimension, though a few interesting exceptions do exist. There is very little action and suspense, which means the book focuses mainly on plot - a plot which, I should add, goes mostly unresolved. Margaret Weis' writing style makes this an interesting read, but people that have never read any Dragonlance before would be better of reading the Chronicles and Legends books first (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, Dragons of Spring Dawning, Time of the Twins, etc..).Rating: Better than Dragons of Summer Flame and Jean Rabe's horrible trilogy, not as good as Chronicles, Legends, The Doom Brigade, or The Soulforge."
3,"OK, but not as good as Chronicles","If you're REALLY into Dragonlance give it a go. I found them to be really long, repetitive and boring. I still read all three because some of the characters were interesting and you get to find out the final fates of some characters. It just really lacked the magic that the original Chronicles series had of a group of adventurers tied together. Here you get a bunch of adventurers all experiencing different (and somewhat boring) adventures, and maybe one or two of them bump into each other along the way."
3,Novel doesn't quite fit in(Caution very very slight spoiler),"When I heard that Weis and Hickman had released a new novel detailing the times after the fifth age, I was at the very least excited. Maybe it was the lack of action, or the inconclusive ending, but either way this novel left me wondering whether or not I want to read the rest of this series. I have read all of the ""Dragons of..."" books and this one really did not fit in. I can count on one hand the number of action sequences. And a jumpy story line made it quite hard at times to stay interested. The novel takes a very long time to get going, and once it does it flows like molasses. Don't get me wrong, Weis and Hickman make an extradordinary writing team, but it seems they didn't know how to end this one.(Goldmoon underwater with a gnome? come on) On a brighter note it was good to see some old heroes like Tas, Caramon, and Goldmoon come into the picture."
4,Continuing Classics,"I found this book to be an enjoyable reading experience. I have several hundred science fiction/fantasy books, and am quite sure that this one will be read again and again. While most of the story stays along with the major charicters, I enjoyed the indepth introduction and compatability of new ones. Most Dragonlance fans will be pleased with the cohesiveness of Ansalon with the growing population of heros. New readers may find that they have stepped into a fast paced world of WATCH YOUR STEP OR DIE fantasy, mixed with good humor and memorable people. ENJOY!!"
2,HER GREEDY RECORD LABEL .SHES HAS NO CONTROL,"THIS IS TRULY A CASE OF GREED BY THE FOLKS WHO ALREADY PUT OUT 3 OTHER BEST OF CDS WHILE SHES BEEN GONE .THIS CD CAME FROM HER 86 LONDON TOUR AND A DC CONCERT WHEN SHE WAS RAW AND UNPOLISHED ,THERE MESSING UP HER GOOD NAME FOR THE SAKE OF A DOLLAR. HER NEW ALBUM SHOULD BE OUT SOON AND SHE MIGHT PUT OUT HER OWN LIVE CD. I RECENTLY SAW HER LIVE AND SHE SOUNDS TEN TIMES BETTER ,IM SURE SHE HAS PLENTY OF BETTER LIVE MATERIAL THEY COULD HAVE USED"
3,Expendable.,"If you (like me) owned the VHS tape from which this CD was made--you'll undoubtedly be disappointed. Anita Baker is undeniably one of the best female vocalists of our time but this CD's release was unnecessary and unwarranted. Stick to the ""Rapture"", ""Compositions"" and ""Giving You the best That I Got"" CDs--these are timeless masterpieces (whereas this Cd is expendable)."
2,Something Old - Nothing New,"I have always loved Anita's voice as well as the music it can produce. But I am sure this project was released in an attempt to introduce what is to come and that is her next studio project. I didn't buy this cd because I had the honors of downloading it from a site first and let me tell you that there is nothing new/origianl about it. Even if it is live, it still is a dead product. Same ole songs, same ole tired lyrics. Buy the originals and you will get your $$ worth. I can't wait for her new cd which is due out in September I think. Until then, stuff the money you were going to use to purchase this cd in your piggy bank and save it for the new one. There is no Rapture to be caught up in in my opinion."
3,For Anita Completists ONLY!!,"Please, don't be fooled by the title of this CD, 'A Night Of Rapture...Live!'. Instead of getting an Anita Baker CONCERT, you get a collection live versions of songs from 'Rapture', complete with nagging fade outs & silence after tracks. This CD does not flow like great concert albums are SUPPOSED TO! Rhino/WEA needs to be smacked hard for this crap, and once I get the original VHS tape, I'll make my own Anita Baker Live CD.The packaging/liner notes are very good, and the bonus footage is nothing but a weak teaser (can we get an 'Anita Baker Live' DVD PLEASE ??)There's no continuity on this CD, and I can't wait to get rid of it!!!! I gave this CD 3 stars because Anita is in good voice (for the most part), and the band is acceptable.F.Y.I. - Anita's rendition of the jazzy 'Moondance' made me feel a little better about this lame CD, but it's still headed straight to the first used CD bin I can find!!"
4,SPLIT SECOND,"S cary situation for Maggie O'DellP risoner escapes, makes her life hellL evel of horror rises as he homes in on his preyI t's Maggie, the profiler, who must save the day.T ension mounts, he's a monster, a heartless killerS eems nothing can stop him, makes it a thriller.E very second's crucial as the body count growsC an only be one target as Maggie well knows.O ccasionally, this book becomes very gruesomeN ot only the murders, but the unlikely twosomeD on't miss it if you're a fan of heart-in-the-mouth tension"
4,An Exciting Read,"First if you have not read Kava's A Perfect Evil do so. The people who are the main focus of A Split Second are introduced. Once you have the book(s) make sure you have a lot of time to spend reading. This is an exciting suspense story, one you will not want to put down. Kava does a wonderful job taking you as the reader on a climb into the intrigue of the story. There are several characters introduced; some having subplots. Kava has done a nice job leaving the possiblity of using these people in future books. The only reason I did not give 5 stars for the book was the way it was ended. Though all loose ends were tied up, I felt dissppointed on the ending. It seemed as though for what ever the reason she had to hurry the ending. It had a let down effect as a whole on the book. One page we are engrossed in a search of a house that is on fire, the next everyone (that matters) is out. Not much written on how they got there. All in all I still recommend that you read this book."
3,A Notch Below,"Prior reviewers have already divulged more than you need to know about this book before you ""Just Read It!"" Clarice (er- FBI Agent/profiler Maggie) is back and Hannibal (er- brutal serial killer Albert Starkey ) has escaped from custody. I strongly urge you to read Kava's first book, *A Perfect Evil,* first and then *Spit Second* second, as these books are as interwoven as daytime serials and are ""To Be Continued"" in the next episode: *The Soul Catcher,* which lives up to * A Perfect Evil,"" which are both much better than this perhaps transitional episode. Stay tuned! See what happens to Harvey (no, he's not a 6 foot sometimes-invisible rabbit this time.)"
4,Perfect Follow up!,"This one reads just as nicely as the first novel featuring these characters. Once again, our heroine is back, fighting internal demons as well as nasty seriel killers. The characters here are more developed than in 'Perfect Evil' and you can really feel the anguish that Maggie is going through. The reunion with Nick Morelli is nicely done and not sappy at all. The ending is truly creepy and lives up to the title of the book. I am highly recommending this one and can't wait for the next :)Thanks for reading!~Pandora"
4,a great sequel,"This was a much better book to the first, ""A Perfect Evil"". It reminded me a little bit of ""Kiss the Girls"" and thank goodness Maggie O'Dell hasn't fallen into the ""I'm-so-perfect-you'll-end-up-hating-my-guts"" Kay Scarpetta niche. You'll see just how fragile and strong O'Dell can be.It's a page turner - once you pick it up, you won't want to put it down."
2,Sloppy about the details and an unconvincing main character,"I'm about 2/3 of the way through this book and trying to decide whether to finish. It is not a compelling story, and it seems very derivative. I've noticed several places where a small amount of research would have helped get the details straight. For example, Tess's boyfriend rejects the Californian Bordeaux and asks for a New York one. I believe that, as with most French regional wines, the label Bordeaux can't be used unless the wine comes from Bordeaux. Therefore, there's no such thing as a Californian or New York Bordeaux.The interactions among the various law enforcement personnel don't seem very convincing to me, either, but I can't believe at all in Maggie O'Dell as a convincing agent. A woman who leaves her gun in the desk drawer for the movers to find? She is so terrorized that if she was a responsible professional she would have taken herself off the case to begin with."
3,"Hmm, Thomas Harris is this you?","Wow, Kava sure didn't put much imagination into this book. This book just turns my stomach with its unorigionality. The killer escapes, has a favorite female fbi agent, who just happens to be a greatly dedicated agent, that he teases with his killings. He even has a hole that he keeps his victims in until he kills them. Didn't even finish this book, the woman in the hole was the last straw. So dissapointing as I enjoyed A Perfect Evil."
2,not very good,this book at lest i think is so munch like hanibal but it just falls flat. It was o.k but i would not ask anyone to read unless you had a lot of free time.
2,Ridiculous follow-up,"At the end of A PERFECT EVIL serial killer Albert Stucky escapes police custody after getting assistance from the Platte City kidnapper. Profiler and FBI Agent Maggie O'Dell is given menial duties in order for the Bureau to find Stucky. This book introduces Agent R. J. Tully, another profiler sent to work on this case alone and later with Agent O'Dell's assistance.Ms. Kava expects the reader to dismiss many leaps of logic in order to enjoy this book. Maggie is recently divorced from her husband and is now living on her own. Stucky tracks her down and stalks her endlessly avoiding detection. Every woman that interacts with Maggie becomes a victim of Stucky and wind up completely brutalized. This is a bit hard to swallow since the author also has Albert performing tasks. He makes him seem a bit ubiquitous and ever knowing. This is not how she portray Stucky at end. This book was a big let down."
3,Deipnon kunos,My only complaint about this otherwise excellent dictionary is the lack of a proper English - Greek section: only 65 pages as opposed to 365 pages of Greek-English.
3,Okay...,"Pros:- good, easy to read format- selection of ancient greek names- comprehensive greek section- map of ancient Greece- good alphabet table in frontcons:- the english to greek section is VERY short and not very comprehensive.- the section on grammer/pronunciation is only three pages longAll in all, an okay buy."
4,"Continuing in the vein of Portishead, this band delivers.","I listened to them on a compilation CD, and I knew I had found that ""new band"". Their smooth, smoky sounds will remind you of Portishead, but there not as blue, making them more listenable and they retain a freshness and originality that Morcheeba didn't quite capture on their debut album. If you like the media dubbed genre ""trip-hop"", then Smoke City is the band that delivers and continues in the vein which Portishead started but didn't quite follow through on in their second album. I know it's only a single, but I have that feeling you'll hear more from these guys real soon. Highly recommended."
5,Gorgeous,"Fabulous CD with an interesting mix of Brazilian and Techno sounds. I will also recommend the album ""Flying Away"". The singer's voice is absolutely charming and it just creates the right mood for an evening with your lover."
2,Dimension Master Plus,"The product did not work. I basicaaly wasted my money, which was $50 plus about $5 for shipping. I took a risk buying used, but the product should have a least worked out of the box."
2,It spent more time on the bookshelf than off.,"I did not like the approach to parenting presented in this book. I did like What to Expect when your Expecting, but found this book lacking. It spent more time on the bookshelf than off. It does not address the parenting problems that I encountered. The food guidlines are unrealistic at best. I am much more of a Dr. Sears approach parent."
4,Great book,Although this is an older version of the book and a few things are outdated I am very happy with it. The shipment came quickly and in good condition.
1,Don't touch this book with a ten foot pole!,"I would have liked to give 0 stars!While the basic idea behind the book is great(easy references for each month) I would recommend that anyone who get this as a well intentioned gift thow it out the window! The information on sleep, crying and feeding is incorrect and borderline abusive! Try Dr. Sears instead!"
1,"For ""mainstream parents"" of today","Although there is some useful info in this book, I found it to be very cold on the issues of breastfeeding, co-sleeping, and attatchment parenting. I'm sorry, but I can't agree with anyone who suggests to let your baby ""cry it out"" so you can selfishly get more sleep while traumatizing your child."
1,Full of misinformation and misdirection.,"There are so many quality books out there that it is a shame that people buy this one. Things are stated as fact that clearly are not. I was given this book as a gift and after reading it, I threw it away rather than pass it on to someone else."
3,Buy the Sears' book instead,"I really didn't like the parts in this book about baby carriers, crying it out and co sleeping. Some of the medical advice conflicts what is given in other books written by doctors. I also found this with ""What to Expect when You're Expecting."" The Q&A format was not easy for me to follow at all. There is some good stuff in this book but after reading their comments about the above things, I wondered whether their advice was accurate or not."
1,WTE Disappointment,"WTE was recommended to me by many friends when I was expecting my first child. I received WTE as a gift and avidly read every word. I was very disppointed by many of the recommendations regarding breastfeeding and introducing solids. WTE has bad information regarding both breastfeeding and weaning. WTE's recommendation to introduce solds at 4 months and to wean at 10 months contradicts the AAP's recommendation that breastmilk should be the only food for the first 6 months and babies should be breasfed to at least 1 year. The WHO also recommends breastfeeding until at least age 2. Unfortunately, WTE is an example of a popular book that is spreading misinformation. Readers beware!"
1,Terrible!,"Inconsistent and poorly thought-out advice for the new parent. I won't list all the details, but for example the section on 10-month-olds has an entire section on weaning, when most doctors agree that babies should be breastfed for at least one year, and preferably longer. No 10-month-old self weans, and sending the message that a parent should be forcefully weaning a 10-month-old is absurd if both parent and child are happy with the relationship. The monthly ""milestones"" are haphazard, with a ""Your baby will probably be..."" one month, then two months later that same activity is in the ""Your baby might even be able to..."" section."
3,Some helpful info,"As the mother of 2 month old twins, I have found this book helpful for medical advice ... my boys have had some minor problems and I first referenced the book before calling the pediatrician. In all cases, the ped gave the same advice as the book.Now that we're entering the third month, however, the books advice is not that great ... for example, one of the suggestions to get a baby to sleep through the night is to NOT change their diaper during the night unless absolutely necessary (meaning if they've pooped). I just think that's stupid advice. Wouldn't a baby sleep more comfortably if their diaper were not full of pee? Just my opinion.I'm also disapppointed in the amount of information about multiples ... two whole pages. All of the information about getting baby to sleep, etc. is geared toward single babies. It's a WHOLE new ball game when you have two little ones to handle."
1,Too much bad info,"It's too bad that this series is so popular, because it just serves to reinforce a lot of worn-out myths about parenting, particularly about sleep habits and ""crying it out"". Further, some of the breastfeeding info is just plain wrong. Please don't let this book be your only source of information. Sears' _The Baby Book_ would provide some balance on sleep habits; Huggins' _Nursing Mother's Companion_ gives *accurate* breastfeeding info."
1,One Sided and insensitive,"This book means well but when children are concerned meaning well isn't enough. The book treats parenting as though there are answers to all the questions. It offers quick solutions to serious problems such as sleeping through the night. It advises parents to let their infants ""cry it out"". While this solution may be a choice for some, the book offers no alternatives. Other issues such as breastfeeding is made to sound stressful. I found that while looking for support this book makes you feel like quitting is best. Parenting is hard work with no easy solutions. If you are a first time parent this book is not the best option. It encourages you to follow the book rather than trusting yourself as to what is best for your baby."
2,Disappointing,"I found this to be a disappointing follow up to their very good book on pregnancy. My biggest complaint is that their advice on language and how to talk to your baby is simply _wrong_. They suggest NOT speaking a second language to a young baby, and give a laundry list of ""how to talk to your baby"".Other complaints: The format does not work well for a busy parent trying to get quick information. They don't give a good sense of overall development."
1,Don't even open this book!,"There are many things I dislike about this book, but the final straw was the section about using the ""cry-it-out"" approach. In reading the section, the author actually made me feel like a bad parent for not being able to leave my baby to scream alone in his crib! Luckily, I had other (and much better) resources to turn to!!"
2,"good general information, bad parenting advice","I agree with most of the other reviews. This book has good general advice on what developmental milestones your baby may be reaching and the symptoms of various illnesses. However, the parenting advice is very outdated and harsh. They want you to treat your baby like a puppy that needs to be trained to behave, instead of as an individual with wants and needs of their own. They are very oppossed to extended breast feeding, co sleeping and responding to a babies signals. I'm sure people who follow this advice have well behaved babies, but at what cost? Are these the kids that freak out in high school because they have never had their needs met? I would recommend instead The Baby Book and First Feelings for good advice on parenting a baby."
5,Simply the best series. Answers virtually every question!,This series is the best. Simple and practical advise that new mothers can easily reference and even fathers will find it extremely helpful. I recommend it for every expecting and new mother. I just got another copy for my daughter in law.
1,"Very anti-breastfeeding, very anti-cloth diapering.","I was very disappointed in the seemingly anti-breastfeeding attitude in this book. If you plan on breastfeeding, this book is not for you. Also, we have chosen to cloth diaper our son, and this book makes it sound like the worst thing you can do for your child. The only people who will like this book are those that formula feed their babies and diaper them in synthetic diapers."
3,Too much reading for new mom,"I prefer the week by week book instead of the q and a format of this book. I find myself using it as a reference tool sometimes, but have barely used it! The week by week book Dr. Curtis was much more informational. See rating on that book."
2,Very hard on fathers,"See all the other comments about What to Expect In the First Year not being up to modern parenting. But on top of that, it's very hard on fathers -- it assumes that they're incompetent around babies and around the house, and will only be useful if mom teaches them how. For instance, one of its suggestions if mom is feeling overwhelmed after the birth is to teach dad a feel tasks around the house -- maybe with help he could learn to do the laundry!"
2,Buy Dr. Sears' book instead,"I obsessed over the information in this book for the whole of my first child's fist year of life. I anxiously turned to the listings for each month to make sure that my child was ""normal."" I fretted when my parenting style didn't match the one emphasized in the book. What a waste of time! My second child is about to turn one and I realize that I didn't consult this book once during his entire first year. The information (like the information in ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"") tends to feed, rather than alleviate, worry about your child's development. Dr. Sears' ""The Baby Book"" is a thousand times more useful."
1,Parenting Misinformation,"Much of the breastfeeding information is incorrect. As strict as the ""What to Expect When You are Expecting"" book was about EVERY bite being important during pregnancy, I'm surprised this book is so supportive of feeding babies artificial milk. In addition, exactlly why do I have a problem if my baby sleeps in the bed with me? I believe babies need daytime and nighttime parents. Seven month old babies manipulate Mom for attention? Maybe seven month old babies need attentive moms."
3,"A nice reference, but leaves something to be desired","As the mother of 2 (ages 3 and 6 mos), I've found that I only reference this book when I want to review what my infant will probably be doing at at each stage. Otherwise, I've found that the book often doesn't contain the info I'm looking for. I also dislike the tone of the book -- it tends to make me feel like I'm doing the ""wrong"" thing, and I think it feeds into the notion that it's possible to do ""everything right""."
1,Outdated and used!,I thought I was purchasing a new book but apparently not. The information is outdated and I recently found a page with a coffee stain on it! Soooo not happy.
1,No wonder modern parents are so uptight,"I hate this book. It is needlessly alarming and makes parenthood sound like a burdensome chore. They make it sound like breastfeeding is a major nuisance. It's not. Just playing with your kid is presented as having a right and wrong way to do it. A typical example of weirdly alarming advice: they reccommend don't leave kids alone for even one second because ""a house fire could start at any minute"" I mean, there are plenty of good reasons not to leave kids alone, and yes families should have a fire escape plan, but house fire danger is *not* the primary reason to keep an eye on your kids. A friend gave this to me as a shower gift and said it was great. It's not. If lots of parents are reading this kind of nutso advice it's no wonder so many of them seem so uptight."
1,A Waste of Money,"This book is filled with outdated, culturally biased, and poorly researched information on co-sleeping, breastfeeding, and infant nutrition. The most glaring example of this is that this book advocates weaning (from the breast) at 9-10 months...never mind the fact that the AAP recommends breastfeeding a MINIMUM of 1 year and that the WHO recommends breastfeeding a MINIMUM of 2 years. Buy the Sears Baby Book instead."
1,Waste of time,"This book is a ridiculous waste of time. I used it for the first few months, just for the milestone charts. Everything else in this book was of no help whatsoever.The breastfeeding information is pretty bad. It makes one wonder if the author even has any experience with nursing a child.Spend your money on The Baby Book by Dr Sears instead. It is so much more informative, from diapers to breastfeeding, to formula feeding, to illnesses. The What to Expect book doesn't even come close!"
2,Frustration...frustration...frustration,"A friend had gotten this book for me because she saw me reading the ""What to Expect when you're Expecting"" (which was a great book by the way). But ""What to Expect the First Year"" was a great disappointment. I found the Q&A format in the book totally confusing and frustrating. I could never find any answers...nor can I find the questions! I stopped reading the book after 50 pages cuz I was getting a headache from trying to find what I was looking for."
2,As I become more & more experienced I like it less & less.,"I found this book to be very helpful as I struggled through the first year with my first child. Now, having a broader experience (I'm now a mom of three) and having read others, I am actually offended by some of the ""advice"" given. I recommend ""The Baby Book"" by Sears & Sears."
3,"A fine reference book, but shouldn't be your only one.","In principle, I have found the What to Expect Series a usefulif not always authoritative reference. Taken on a whole however, I admit togrowing tired of the holier-than-thou tone of much of their advice.Maybe in some parallel universe there are mothers who go through their entire pregnancies without eatinga few pints of Ben and Jerry's ice cream (not the low fat forzen yogurt) andgive birth to babies who manage to grow up not knowingor craving the taste of brown sugar on their oatmeal, and whocan be placed in their cribs awake, but sleepy, and manage to fall asleep just fine on their own.In my world however, those things are more the exception. And I justwish the WTE books cut parents just a little more slack."
1,"Rotten, misguided information","I threw my copy out. What a waste of money. This is a book for parents who don't want to be bothered with parenting. The advice on getting a baby to sleep is horrible, almost bordering on abuse. This book actually gives tips on how to ignore your baby's hysterical cries. Ouch! Also the advice encourages fear and paranoia in a new mom. The bit on what the baby should be doing every month is enough to drive anyone to the nearest shrink. Talk to your doctor not this book... Read Dr. Sear's The Baby Book and boycott this abusive, non-caring approach by these wacky authors. Believe me, your precious little baby will thank you."
3,"Not bad, but there are better options","This book is the logical continuation to the ""What to expect when you're expecting"" book, which all expecting parents get, whether they want it or not (I mean, it's almost inevitable to get a copy of it -we got it through our gyno-obstetrician!) However, with the follow-up book, the nice organization and logical structure breaks down a bit, and wanting to cover too many things, it becomes hard to follow. Sure, there is a chapter corresponding to each month of the baby's life, but then after that, there's mention about the first six weeks (yes, after the twelfth month, the first 6 weeks pop up!) Now, what to do? Go get a copy of the EXCELLENT ""Learning Early"", by Dorothy Einon. It's got a great organization and it's also packed with color pictures to help you through the first months of your baby's life."
2,I just hate her TONE!!,"I have to say that What to Expect When You Are Expecting was helpful, and this book was at times, but I can't get past her tone!! Sometimes she comes across like all-knowing and you just have to shake it off and go with your own parenting wisdom--believe me, you DO have some of your own that's better than what's in this book. I will give it credit for helping with some basic questions, but I don't agree with everything. AND if I read the words ""Best Odds Diet, Recipes"" etc. one more time--I will scream! I won't be buying the Toddler Years book--I am looking for a friendlier book or simply a medical/developmental facts book."
3,Just okay,"Boy is this book thick and heavy! One-third could (and should) have been edited out. The information, once you got past the chatter, was good but with a baby in the house, I didn't have the time or patience to read the nonsense. Also with this book (and all other books on child development), take it with just a few grains of salt. Not all healthy children develop at the same speed and you might be getting nervous for nothing abiding by ""experts"" calendars for what should happen when. All that said, I still recommend it as much of the information is quite good for the first time parent."
5,This is the Owner's Manual for your baby's first 12 months!,"I was surprised at the negative reviews for this book, it made me wonder if they had read it. I've used it through both of my children's first 12 months. I bought it after I asked 5 ""mom"" friends, ""If you could only afford to buy one book for baby care, what would it be?"" 4 of the 5 offered this book, and I completely agree. It's thoughtful, well laid-out, comforting, and informative. It gives you ideas, takes away your fears, and ENCOURAGES that all-important parental bond. I look at it for a checklist of items to cover with the pediatrician before every well-child check-up. I peek ahead to see ""what's coming,"" so by the time my child hits a development level, I'm ready with appropriate toys, activities and attitude! The best thing about it: it lets me relax and enjoy my child, without undue worry. I LOVE THIS BOOK, I give it to every expecting friend. It truly is the ""owner's manual"" for your little one. Enjoy!"
1,what to expect the first year,really pissed that this guy sent me the old edition when he labeled it as newi tried to return and he never got back to mecrummy
5,very helpful for a first time mom!!!,"with all the questions i had in my head, this book was the perfect thing to answer them all. love how it's broken down to each stage/month of your pregnancy. it was a lot of fun to follow along during the 9 months!"
4,Expect First,This book is great! It is informational and on an easy-to-read level. I used the information to help incorporate myself into my son's development.
2,"Too biased, opinionated","It's obvious this book is full of helpful facts, but I couldn't get past the constant insertion of biased comments from the authors. In the Six-Month-Baby chapter they call parents ""week nerved"" (mispelling is theirs) because they don't use the Cry It Out method. There is also a constant use of negative adjectives like a babies ""pathetic"" hand wave to get parents attention (also in the Six-Month chapter).I may refer to this book occasionally, but I will not recommend it to anyone. It will probably collect dust on my book shelf."
3,A reference - plain and simple,"I find WTOTFY to be a helpful reference in raising my children. Sometimes I have a question or a concern about my child and I go the book and try to find an answer. Sometimes the answer satisfies me, sometimes it doesn't. This is a subjective book, using other people's opinions about raising children. Some of the things in the book I don't like, for example, the diet, the ""crying it out section"", but I think that you are going to find that in any book of this kind. Some things you take to heart, somethings you don't. In general, I think it contains many useful bits of information that may put a parent at ease or help them solve a particular problem. I also use other references, like the Sears Baby Book. Between the two books, my own common sense and mother's intuition, I think that I have what I need to be a successful mother. I guess what I am trying to say is that you don't have to do everything by the book."
2,Okay-but opinionated and sometimes lacking accurate info.,"I have read dozens of books on parenting (what can I say, I'm a bibliophile and a concerned parent <g>); this is not my favorite. It is fine for basic medical advice, basic hygeine care and basic dietary requirements for an infant. However, I found it lacking in addressing the issues of long-term breastfeeding (which is supported by MUCH recent medical research), co-sleeping, nightwaking, parental instincts, etc. It's an adequate book for basic baby care. It is NOT the book that I would recommend as a primary reference for new parents (I would wholeheartedly recommend _The Baby Book_ by Sears & Sears for that!)."
3,"Be careful giving this book, it might be the fifth copy!","This book seems top the list of books to give an expectant mother. I was given 5 copies, after I had bought one for myself! When I went to return them the woman behind the counter said ""This happens all the time."" The information in the book is well organised and easy to refer back to, but also quite strict. When exhausted from taking care of a newborn, a little forgiveness goes a long way."
2,"Takes a tough, not tender approach","Advice promotes not letting a child change your life too much, which is ridculous. Babies need a lot more attention than this book would indicate."
1,sad,"I was shocked to see that the authors think that a baby banging her head against a crib and rocking herself is normal. This shows that the baby needs more holding and love. They do say that maybe you could hold your headbanging self-rocking baby more,--but they caution you not to hold her too much!! A baby can never be held too much!"
5,what to expect book,this is a must have book for every new mom. great information that is easy to understand
4,Fantastic,It helped me alot as a father. I recomend this book before any other ones.Pick this up as soon as you know you are pregant.
2,Scares mothers to death!,"What To Expect When Expecting was good info for being pregnant the first time. However, when I found out I was pregnant, I felt confident that I could be a good mother. By the time I had read What To Expect The 1st Year, I felt like a paranoid idiot. NOT ALL BABIES ARE THE SAME!!! In this day and age of EXPERTS on everything, I think we need to remember who the experts are here--the MOTHERS. We know our kids better than anyone. I went and bought Dr. Spock's revised ed. The first sentence is TRUST YOURSELF. I don't feel like such an idiot anymore. Not all babies start on solids at 4mo or can put themselves to sleep, or want juice, etc. Only mothers know what their babies need."
2,The Easy Method of Parenting,"""Don't worry about it,"" is the prevailing wisdom of this book. Extremely reassuring, but a bit condenscending, I found this book to offer a pat on the back when I really wanted more thoughtful, researched answers. This book is the bible of childrearing for those who don't like to read, don't have time to read, or just want to make it through the first year as easily as possible. I do not even recommend it as a quick reference book since the format is question and answer, divided up by month, so, without subject headings, it is difficult to access. Do yourself and your baby a favor by reading some more complete and up-to-date authors such as William Sears and Burton White."
2,Go to Dr. Sears!,"I used ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" while pregnant, so I thought it a natural step to buy this book. I tossed it aside in frustration. Its advice is fine if you have a machine for a baby, but for the rest of us...I was so glad to discover Dr. Sears' series of books. These are the books people need for advice on raising people."
1,Not a good choice for new parents,"Material is dated, one sided and offers little if any information as to sources of recommendations made. This book is less than credible and a waste of money!"
1,Not even worth 1 Star!,"These books sell so well, you'd expect more people to speak up! The first one, What to expect when you're expecting is good. The others are horrible. The first years and toddler years are full of mis-information and are too far out there! I've given up on even using them. Everytime my son would get sick, I'd look it up in the book, and follow the directions or warnings. I realized instead of being a comfort, the book was only causing more worry (and I am not the type of person to read all the problem sections and worry about each problem mentioned). The solutions to behavioral problems were way too lax, I suppose if you're tyring to abide by the ""don't hurt the child's psyche"" idea, they might work, but whatever happened to sincere, but loving discipline? I don't want a 2 year old to run the house, but that's just about what this book leads you to think should be done.This book is a waste of money. I'm ashamed to say I ever used it! The authors are out of touch with reality."
3,"It's a book, not the Bible. Use YOUR intuition!","I have both the Sears book and this book, given to me before and after my son was born. With BOTH these books, you have to DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR YOU AND YOUR BABY and don't feel guilty if you don't want to or can't do them. Breastfeeding, unfortunately, did not work out for me, and co-sleeping wasn't for me, either. I hold my baby a lot, talk to him all the time, rock him to sleep, and I never let him cry it out (too harsh for me). He is happy and well-adjusted for 3 months; he doesn't cry except when he's hungry and he laughs, smiles and coos often. I found parts of the Sears book made me feel guilty as hell for not practicing what they preached, and parts of this book to be too cold and unfeeling. It boils down to: DON'T RELY SOLELY ON BOOKS TO HELP YOU RAISE YOUR BABY. Use your common sense. If your baby is happy, you know you're doing the right thing."
4,Great Book!,"Great book with lots of information. I would get it before the baby is born and read up then because after the baby is born there is no time for a while. I like to see how advanced my baby is and each chapter has things that your baby should, might, or may even; be able to do."
1,Not reccomended reading,"I really liked ""What to Expect When You are Expecting"", but was very disappointed with this one. The authors (who are NOT doctors, or even in the medical field) present their inaccurate information as fact. They advocate the ""cry it out"" school of thought, which does not take into consideration the baby's needs. The breastfeeding information is incorrect, and could easily sabatoge a new mother's nursing relationship. ""The Baby Book"" by Dr. Sears is a much better alternative."
2,full of lousy information while posing otherwise,"Does the typical presentation of breastfeeding as a lifestylechoice and formula feeding as 'just as good'. Ick. It fails topresent any of the very real information on the health risks of not breastfeeding, and does very little to reassure mothers who may be a little hesitant about breastfeeding in public. Pump to go to church?! If you believe in God, why shouldnt' you believe that God made breasts to nourish babies?The sleep information is a rehash of the tired Ferber, cry it out theme which runs counter to almost every mother's instincts of what her child needs. The authors seem to think that mothers dont' have any intuition or ability to follow their heart when nurturing their babies. Read ""the Baby Book"" by William and Martha Sears- a much better reference and more compassionate to our next generation.The only thing good about it is the breastfeeding preeemies information, and that it isn't as bad as Baby(un)wise."
5,Great resource for new moms (and dads),"This is a great resource for new parents. I find myself going to this book often when I have questions about my baby. I have not sat down to read the book through beginning to end, but rather use it as a reference book when I have a question about something. I highly recommend it."
5,Such a value!,"This set contains all four of the masterlife book series and not only is it a blessing but the price is truly a savings! When I purchased the entire set I was able to save so much ( I only paid for the price of two books by buying the entire set instead of each book individually). The books themselves are lifechanging, it is a long course- 24 weeks total (6 weeks each book) but you learn so much not only about yourself but what it really takes to be a disciple for God. If you commit to it, it will definitely bring you into a closer relationship with God. Side Note: these are workbooks so I would purchase them new only!"
5,Amazing Story,"This is a story about an amazing man who refused to carry a gun, was persecuted for it over and over, yet never gave up his conviction. And as the story unfolds, the very people who persecuted him, not only come to love and respect him, but their very lives are saved by the man they tried to get booted out of the army for his beliefs. What an amazing story."
5,Great American Hero,"This is one of the all time best movies I have ever seen. It's a little slow at first, but if you're interested in inspirational stories, this is for you. The man this movie is about has to be one of the most amazing people I've ever heard about."
3,"great songs, but totally not what i expected","I had the pleasure of being blessed by Farley's mixing abilities in person, this man can get it goin!!! So naturally I was excited when I found a cd that he mixed. When I put it in my player, those thumpin, bassy, get down and dance tunes came through. I am naturally a lover of vocals on tracks, especially house music, but Farley was showing a much different side on this cd. I am not going to say it is bad, it is not, and I respect Farley for his beliefs, but if I had know this cd is mostly a comfirmation of Farley's belief in Jesus, I probably would not have purchased it. I Love Sounds of Blackness, their message is uplifting, but this cd was alll vocal's praising God. So if you want an awesome Christian house cd, BUY THIS CD! If not stick to seeing him live. He is still one of the kings of house."
4,Gospel House!,"I partied to the music spinned by Farley, Frankie Knuckles, and Ron Hardy just to name a few, back in the day. I am a Born-Again Christian now, just like Farley, and to hear the LORD being praised through this GospelHouse compilation is very refreshing. Farley still has the skills! Keep praising HIS NAME!"
3,Gospel Feel,"If you like ""Gospel House"" you'll like this one. It's a collection of some of frankies and Farley's original warehouse pumps, mixed with today's feel. I bought a copy in Chicago a few years ago, but now, it collects dust. There's also an ""Interview Disc"" included, with some british bloak interviewing some of the legends of house. The interview of course is centered around the old question: ""Where did House Music start."" It's a silly and tired question these days....most house music lovers know the answer to this now rediculous question: House music was was originated in ""CHICAGO""!!!! Not a bad CD!!"
4,FARLEY'S NEW PHASE,I REALLY ENJOYED THS CD-THE RELIGIOUS OVERTONES DID NOT DISTURB ME-I ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CREATIVE HOW HE BLENDED IT IN-I HOPE FARLEY IS WORKING ON A NEW PROJECT-HE IS ONE OF THE FEW PURE HOUSE DJ'S LEFT-HE IS THE GODFATHER OF THE TRUE HOUSE SOUND--
4,Noise for speed and performance,"Ok, so I've read pobably 30-40mreviews about this drive. I bought thism drive before I read anything, but the price and timing were right when I bought this. I run a PIII 750, 256RAM, several HDs. Mind you I'mrunningna full SCSI system, no IDE equip what-so-ever. I've tested the drive on 2 scsi controllers, (1)PCI Buslogic Flashpoint adapter (2) Symbios Logi 896 (22910 PCI adapter). I've gone through probably 100+ disks, 1 or 2 miswrites due to data error (typically files in use or not available), note NOT BUFFER UNDERRUNS. The drive is noisy but expected, most noise comes from internal fan or mechanical gearing to guarantee drive spinning at 16x for duration of burn. Also using Nero Burn for all disc creation, ranging from Audio CDs, MP3 CDs, Video-CDs, data backup, direct disc copying and basically anything else one can do. To reduce noise try mounting drive away from other components and using drive rails to reduce external vibrations."
1,SCSI Interface Trouble,"There is some general interface issue with Yamaha new CRW2100. In Adaptec EasyCD Creator under CD Information I get ""Bad media"" error. After rebooting first CD is read fine. Reinserting CD causes the error. I tried different media (Verbatim, Memorex, Maxell, HP, Sony, Yamaha), different OS (Win2000, Win98SE). I upgraded Easy Creator to version 4.02e (Yamaha patch) and 4.03 (Adaptec patch). I was so desperate that I downgraded my Tekram PCI DC390 (which works fine with Toshiba DVD-ROM and HP DDS streamer) to Adaptec AHA1542CF. Nothing helps, still the same error and it is impossible to burn CD. I saw very similar problem review about IDE equivalent (CRW2100EZ).Still I did not receive any respond from Yamaha support.If somebody is going to post a god review about CRW2100SZ, please let us know your configuration (OS, motherboard, SCSI adapter)"
5,Yamaha 2100SZ CD-RW 16x10x40 SCSI Internal Kit,wow...this thing is really really fast...but also kinda expensive but if you have da big bucks go for it =) easy installation and comes with adaptec no problems so far
5,Touch,"Excellent very relaxing music. I have several of Michael Jones music.Really enjoy relaxing music, great to listen to in the car, when in traffic."
5,Toy Biz Does It,"This is one of those great Marvel characters who nameless, clueless execs would have considered only after Skateboarding Wolverine and Wolverine Shaving were made. Kudos to the guys at Toy Biz for taking a chance and promoting non-A-list characters. This is a memorable comics character who makes a distinctive and formidable action figure. He comes with lots of great accessories and looks great. The face could be more skull like, but over all this is a keeper."
1,Vonage run by computers not real people!!!!,"I called vonage to cancel my service, it was 3 days before the 2 year contract expiration, told them to just waive the fee. Would not do it, the rep said that the systems are run by computers and nothing could be changed, ridicules!!! So, told them to not disconnect me, since I could wait the 3 days. They disconnected on that same day and charged me $40, these people are crooks."
1,Vonage - the worst thing that happened to communications,"I'll tell you why I hate this service so much:1. Major downtime - I lost service for more than 10 days within the past year2. Sound quality - very loud static, especially when bandwidth is consumed (like when someone is online)3. 15 minute or longer wait time to get a service rep4. Penalties - $40 to cancel within 2yearsI canceled this service and bought the Ooma. $250 one time cost, NO service fees and no downtime. I've been using it for 2 months now. Plus Ooma has far better sound quality and all the features of Vonage."
3,very bad service...,"Hi, all though I oardered it through vonage's website. I am having problems with talking to someone that I can understand. Also, if you are not so knowledge (like I am on technical things) you better get help. I thought since I already had a modem through my cable company that I didn't need to get theirs well turns out that I do need to get their cable modem thingy. Plus I paid for overnight, they are shipping it to me in two days...plus I have to pay for the wrong one to be shipped back to them and not only that since I haven't been able to use it my free month well doesn't change since they know this...I ordered it on the 1st of feburary and know its the 7th and I lost 7 days already and another 2 days till I get the new device. This is stupid. Man make sure you also have no back ground noise like kids or tv or radio because you cannot understand them. sorry but just so you know. But on the other hand it does seem to be a good thing ....if it works ....when I get it ....."
4,Solved my VPN connectivity problems with my VoIP service,"Recently bought this item to go behind my older router and it is working excellent out of the box. If you use a VPN connection to work from home I would recommend this solution instead of buying a all in one VoIP Wireless Router. I was using a Linksys VoIP Wireless Router that Vonage was providing and had nothing but problems connecting to my work's VPN. Lots of wasted time, which adds up to lost productivity (CASH)."
3,Not work with 2-line Panasonic cordless,"Doesn't work with my Panasonic 2-line cordless phone.When the adapter is connected to line 2, that line is always shown as being in use. And there is a loud 60Hz power-line hum noise when you use line 1 as a conventional phone.The Vonage part of it works well. There is some echo on occasion but I understand that that is normal and was prepared for it.If I disconnect the D-Link box from the phone, the problems go away. Returning the D-Link box."
2,Hard to use,This phone adapter is hard to use. It does not come with instructions and does not have a way to put in a static IP. You cannot hook up a computer to it so you better have a router.
3,Songs And Artists That Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11,"I bought this CD mainly for one song, ""The Revolution Starts Now"" by Steve Earl. Yes, I love that song for some reason. Another great track on here is ""Boom!"" by System Of a Down."
1,Researches?????,He Researches before filming LMAO. That is hilarious his movies are pure fiction. I'm a Dem. and voted for Obama. But I still think Moore is a douche and the unfortunately good but liberal bands gave their support to him for some strange reason. HeHe That guy is out of his mind lol.
1,Worthless...just like the movie.,"Don't waste your brain space; no intelligent person would actually enjoy this album. I would elaborate, but it is not even worth wasting my time. I'm keeping this one short...God Bless."
1,Im gonna hurl,"What a schitzo album. Um...Dylan and then Timberlake? While there are a couple great artists on this album, they are not the best tracks ever. While there are many sorry excuses for artists on this album, many will want it for a sappy sentimental reliving of the ""cut and paste"" so-called ""documentary"". If you fork over the cash for this, you definitely wasted your money on the movie too."
1,"Please, get real.....","Not only do I think the mixture of artists makes me want to barf, but I would also believe that the only reason most, (most) people would buy this album because they are politically inclined too. I would only hope you could give this album a good review simply because you enjoy the artist/song.Again, the mixture of artists, the songs, the garbage that pours out of Michael Moore's mouth, all silly myths, there is no reason for me to buy this album, or give any money to their rediculous cause. Like someone else stated, I only gave it one star because that is as low as their ratings go!"
3,"A good anti-war album, however...","This is a good anti-war album, but for those of us who prefer a bit heavier music, this album has a tendency to have songs on it that will likely be to our distaste. For those who prefer more country-oriented music, etcetera, you will likely find that some of the more heavy songs might be a little bit irritating. This album will likely only be enjoyable to those who remain biased to all types of music.For me, personally, although this album may be inspiring, I'd rather create a CD containing a mix of stuff I only enjoy, rather than music that's not to my preference strewn about its various tracks. I suggest listening to the audio files yourself and deciding from there whether this CD, for you, is worth the money."
5,Spoken Word Poetry led me here...,"I was attending an underground spoken word Slam in Philadelphia. This group called Quiet Rage who are supposed to be these hardcore spoken word demons were screaming at everyone who didn't see Fahrenheit 911. They said that anyone who didn't see this movie were ostriches sticking their heads in the ground like cowards. They claimed we were all cowards afraid to face the truth. Afterwards they did this blazing piece that they said was inspired by Michael Moore about pharmaceutical companies being the real drug cartels and drug lords of our country. My grand father is a staunch conservative republican, my father is and I WAS. I accepted Quiet Rage's challenge and watched the movie. This soundtrack captures that movie so perfectly it's almost as frightening as the movie itself. I never felt so stupid and deceived Thanks Michael Moore for this incredible movie and soundtrack and Quiet Rage for leading me to you."
3,"good, could be more balanced","It is a good,thorough book, which is very good to read if you are firmly condvinced that circumcision is great for your child. It tries succesfully to expose some of our preconceptions. However,it is biased towards the ""Don't do it!"" attitude which does not give people a balanced view.Otherwise, a great insight into the problem. Certainly should be read before taking your decision."
1,Steffi Rath,"This is about the worst DVD I have ever bought. Unless you love old-fashioned Italian slapstick - with hardly any real singing by the advertised great tenors - then don't hesitate to buy it. On the other hand, if you want to hear these great singers, just get something else - anything else.I grew up with most of these tenors and can only repeat how terribly disappointed I was in this DVD."
4,If you were born Italian,"If you were born Italian & grew up in a community like this one then you will love this film. It is so funny in the Italian style - it makes me smile & laugh outright. I will bring it with me to NY & share it with my family, they will be delighted!!! (Incidentally, on each Sat afternoon at !:00pm, during opera season at the Met, we had to stop whatever we were doing & gather 'round the radio to listen to Milton Cross & opera ensemble. Mom's orders - capisco?)"
2,NOT Compatible,"This headset does not seem to be manufactured to standard. Bought 2 sets for my iPAQ 6920 with 4 conductor jack. Only got sound from one bud. Gradually pulled out plug and got sound from the other bud. So, both buds work, but not together. Received a set from HP that worked, so it wasn't the jack on the phone. Will cut one bud off and use it for phone calls only. Not worth the shipping to send them back."
2,Good sound but very poor quality.,"These sound good. I use them with my Juke (and sometimes use the headset feature too). The problem is, this is my 2nd pair (just ordered a 3rd), and they are very flimsy. They short out very easily, the wires seem to be very poor. I use mine every day, I don't think however that I am harder on them than the average music listener would be, but they just don't seem to last.. The problem is, too, these seem to be the only headphones I can find that are compatible with the Samsung Juke cell phone. Bummer."
3,A good reference book...excellent Reader for students!,"...an interesting book and worth having in any library. However, those with experience and knowledge of Moroccan internal matters may find this work more of a useful reference document than a thought provoking look at current affairs. As a life-long student of the region I would have enjoyed more detail(s) on the Makhzen. Likewise, there are other factors at play in Morocco that warrant examination, most notably, access to foreign media broadcasts and the internet. I would opine that these new elements in the internal equation are moving that society in unpredictable directions. I look forward to Azzedine Layachi's next work and hope that he'll provide more insights into the country and region."
1,Morocco? I dont think so.,"I own this book, I bought it as a refrence for a term report, I did not enjoy reading it at all. I needed to write a report for class on Morocco, I have family that lives in that country and I wanted to do research on Morocco due to that interest. I was dissapointed with this book. It drags on and on, and you cant see where the author is going with his point of view."
1,No Longer Supported,LearningCo no longer supports this software according to their website. I could not get this software to install on a DELL Windows XP machine.
3,Typing motivation for sports fans!,"As a computer literacy teacher I have tried several learn-to-type programs in the classroom. This program was successful in getting some of the sports minded people to practice their typing with no complaining! It maintained their interest even in the typing of long paragraphs which highlighted interesting stories about great names in the history of basketball. As a teacher however, I found the recording of their progress not as comprhensive and accessible as other programs."
2,Still trying to use this on Vista,"We just bought a new computer which came loaded with Vista (not the one I would have chosen form myself, but oh well). It has a feature that allows it to run older programs on it, but I can't get that to work until I get a glitch fixed that seems to be linked to outlook express.I haven't given up on Slam Dunk yet. Has anyone had success using it with Vista?P.S. I gave it two stars because I had to put in some number. I'll update this review if/when I get the program to work"
2,More of the same...,"This work is typical of Emerson and, more broadly, what I call American poetry's School of Homey Reminiscence: poetry that cannot and really never tries to transcend the particulars of the poet's biography, be it real or imagined. This sort of poetry takes as its measure and standard of reality the poet's own ""poetic sensibility."" There is no larger vision. Necessarily, given their ontological retardation, the forms and language of Emerson's poems must be stiff, respectable and, above all, ""correct."""
4,Kostia's daring compostions brings a new approach to new age,"Kostia has one of the most skillful and daring pianos I have ever heard. I first heard him on a Narada sampler, and it was as if all the other musicians were mere amateurs. While his russian heritage overflows in his compositions, his repertoire does include imagery that is beyond comparison. A definite must have for piano lovers out there. Kostia will be a welcomed addition to your CD library."
2,Heavy going,A difficult read with laborious language and an inconclusive ending. Still gave an insight into the period of writing compared to modern thinking and attitudes.
5,This book is excellent,My wife and I recently adopted a child from another country. We choose the This Is Me Book because it contained information about our childs native country including maps and a picture of the flag. When we received the book we were pleasently surprised. We like the fact that you can add or remove pages to suit your needs. I would recommend this baby book to all adopted parents especially those who are adopting children from out of the United States.
2,Good thing I missed this PPV,"This is the BATMAN & ROBIN of WWE PPV.It is that bad.The only good matches on that card were the CM Punk-Rey Mysterio and the Tag Team Championship match.The rest were CRUD.The DQ ending to the World's championship match was just a big middle finger to WWE fans.The Double count out to the Randy Orton-Edge match was a big rip-off for Egde and Randy fans everywhere.The ending to the ""I Quit"" match between John Cena-Batista was so predictable you could see coming 10 miles away.not only that,it was also overbooked & excessive.Don't get me started the show's many stoppages for blood thought out the PPV.I rather watch WCW Bash At The Beach 2000 again & again,that is how much I hate this PPV.I give this event a 5 and a half out of 10."
3,A little pricey,"While these loofah mitts work well, they are pricey compared to those found in my local stores that have a full mitt."
3,Good but expected more,"I purchased this VHS version to transfer to DVD to add to my extensive DVD opera collection.Because of the rave reviews this video received I conceded that I would have to endure a blackand white version. What I didn't know, and what I wish other reviewers would have commented on,was the lack of subtitles in english. It may be that the other reviewers are multilingual, but a'heads up' would have been nice."
3,"A Nice Try, But...","I really love Romane's music - he never gets stuck in the Gypsy jazz rut, he's always looking to extend the music's boundaries and I always look forward to his new projects. But, for me, this album just doesn't cut it. The style he's chosen (organ trio) only really works properly on one track, Anouman, probably because it's one of the Master's later Bop-ish tunes. The other Django numbers he's chosen to play just sound awkward - they're just not suited to this style. A real shame. Let's hope it doesn't stop Romane carrying on the good work."
4,Very Impressed,"I have been very impressed with this book. It covers the Bible in more detail than I expected. The stories, based on chapters in the Bible, are a good length for bedtime reading. The book is written on a level that my 5 year old can easily follow, yet will be able to absorb even more of the meaning of the stories as she gets older. The artwork is very attractive as well."
5,We LOVE this bible!,"My ds6 & dd5 LOVE the stories in this bible and so does mommy! The illustrations are beautiful and at many times moving. The writing is wonderful and holds their attention. They ALWAYS ask for ""one more chapter pleeeease"". What an improvement (for me) from their previous bible with the cartoonish illustrations (although it served its purpose when the children were younger, it was driving me nuts to read it to them every night, sorry). The chapters are a perfect length for a quick but interesting read before bedtime and if needed a few more minutes can be spent for discussions on the chapter. Our family is almost half way through and have enjoyed each and every chapter!"
5,The Children's Bible in 265 Stories,"I like this book a lot. I have four year old grandson, who before taking his afternoon nap requests that Iread about Jesus to him. He remembers quite well some of the charcters. I am very pleased with the book andthe results it brings. Thank you"
3,"Cute, but some questionable writing","Some of the stories are told in a way that could be misconstrued. Not bad, just little things that may confuse kids, and, since its a childrens bible, I thought that was a bit of a problem."
3,Not bad. Might be a little difficult to unde for young kids,"I like the look of this book over ""365 Read-Aloud Bedtime Bible Stories"", but not its content. While the stories are virtually the same this author seems tries to be more poetic in describing the stories. I found she used words my 4 - year old did not understand. I found myself reading ahead and replacing some of the words I felt my child would have difficulty with.I suppose when my daughter reaches reading age she will like this book more. The illustrations on these pages are nice."
2,Not exactly...,"I bought this to read to my children because it had so many stories. It was the most complete collection I could find. Some of the major stories are broken up into two or three stories, so 365 isn't exactly acurate, but it does cover most of the bible without the lists of who begat whom. It is a good starter, but I don't enjoy reading it aloud, and need to find another. They just sound contrived when read aloud. I've also found subtle changes from what is in the Bible. It seems to me that a book of Bible stories could be written to exactly follow the events that happened, in normal, non-sticky language. Also, I had to, um, simplify the story of David and Bathsheba, because, in my opinion, children don't need even that much detail. It wasn't that bad, but, jeez! Anyway, if nothing else, I can go through it and pick out the less known stories to supplement the books that just have the top ten stories."
5,Children's Bible in 365 stories,"I encourage all parents to purchase this children's bible. It is beautifully illustrated and written in a way that keeps the children's attention. I have Bible study time with my grandchildren and they really look forward to Sunday afternoons! We not only read the section from the story book, but then follow up with the Bible Scripture. The stories are condensed, but quite accurate (with author's discretion to add interest)"
1,Graphic Art and Translation Not Accurate.,"On the third page of this bible it shows Adam and Eve Nude. There are ways of explaining this without being so graphic especially for young children. The Art throughout the bible is beautiful. It is too bad they couldn't leave that out. Also, as other readers, I found the accuracy to be off. If you're going to get God's Holy word you want it to be all truth. If that is important to you, I would not buy this book."
5,Excellent and Speedy Service,"I had ordered the book as a Christmas present, and received it in plenty of time. The book came in excellent condition."
2,The Children's Bible in 365 Stories,I use this book for teaching Sunday School. I'm planning on giving a copy to everyone that teaches Bible Stories to our kids at church because it edits the stories and gives a paraphrase that is accurate to the text.
5,THE BEST Bible Story Book,"Our family (we have 8 children) has read a number of Bible story books. This one stands out to us as THE BEST. It is clearly written so that even the younger ones can follow well. Also, it is written in an interesting manner that the children always want more. A sign of a real winner! With the stories being so short there is always time to read at least one."
5,great,It was better then I thought. Good quality and good shape. Easy to read & understandable. My Grandchild and I are enjoying it.
5,Children's Bible in 365 Stories,"After looking online for an easy to read Bible storybook to read with my 8 year old son, I found the Children's Bible in 365 Stories. I read reviews for other Bible storybooks,but decided on this one. I really like the easy to understand format. It has some pictures on each page also. It holds my sons interest and I'm glad I ordered this book. The stories are short and we actually read more than just 1 story a night. I have also recommended this book to other family members & friends. I'm very pleased with it!!"
3,Okay - but not suitable for my kids,"I bought this bible for my children( then 4 and 7) who were way past the bibles for young children that they had. My problems with this bible were:The book is too thick for small hands to hold easily.The spine is too tight for young children.Vocabulary is really simple - might be okay for three year olds being read to. Really simple for what I wanted - my children to read it for themselves.Each bible story had been shortened so much it lost impact.Pictures, whilst colorful, are not very inspiring."
5,The Children's Bible in 365 Stories,Our church purchased these books for children who we were helping and they loved them. I haven't had a chance to read this one yet but a gentleman at the church said that he checked it out and it was very accurate.
2,A Good Primer,"This book is OK for someone starting out on the path to self realization. In other words, who is the Self??? Ramana Maharshi was a great soul, and he asked, ""Who am I?"" This book begins to explain the difference between the ego and the real Self. I was hoping to find something new, but there is nothing unusual here. Maybe I should stop reading these books on enlightenment and just ""be"". Then God appears. If you are starting out, this book will help you on your journey to unlearning. There is nothing Biblical here. This is for people who want to grow spiritually."
4,Good Chairs,"The wood and quality of the materials seem very good.I've only had this for a week so time will tell.There is a neutral pattern on the seat but it didn't bother me.Took about 30 min to install the first chair and one of the screws didn't go in all the way (my fault).But be aware that one of the legs may end up slightly uneven after you're done assembling it. (one leg is not touching the floor) I tried to adjust and reassemble but there is just a slight ""wiggle"" if you pay attention. It's okay once you sit on it. The weight flexes the chair enough so that all legs touch the floor. Maybe it just needs to ""set-in."" 3 of the 4 chairs I got was like this. Again you wouldn't really notice it and it doesn't wobble if you sit on it."
4,"Great look, a bit uneven","We bought two sets of these stools (4 in total), and they look great. However, out of four stools, only one was actually level (not rocking) when we set them on the floor. I guess this is a risk of any furniture you assemble yourself, but it was a little annoying. That said, it was a pretty easy fix and the stools have stood up well to our every day use of them (which isn't exactly gentle), and still look good. They are great value for the money, and I'd buy them again."
1,Unorthodox Mysticism,"This is not ""biblical truth simply explained,"" this is deceptive new age thought mixed with Christian vocabulary.Gal. 3:13Christ redeemed us of the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written, ""Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree."" Nothing can separate us from His love (Romans 8). Our words have power, but the key is whether they're rooted in sin or the Spirit. If you are in Christ, fear not of any man made curse."
1,"Lost, a perfect title..................","Perfect title becasue that is what should happen to this book. Like most of the reviewers here this was not my first experience in the world of Gregory Maguire and like most here I walked away extemely disappointed. The story telling was dry, sometimes baffling, and the characters never developed into anything more then names on paper. If this is your first taste in Maguire's world don't be discouraged, gived Wicked and it's sequel a shot, they are far superior books."
2,I made a mistake,"I picked up Lost expecting it to be like Wicked or Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, it certainly wasn't like either of them. The plot wanders all over the map, none of the characters were interesting, least of all Winifred Rudge. I spent most of the book completely lost(Okay, bad pun). The end was better than the rest of the book, Maguire seemed to have decided by then where it was going, and it tied up some loose ends, but overall, it just wasn't as great or as thought provoking as his other works."
2,Lost me,"Be warned, Lost is a huge blunder by the author. It features a very unlikeable main character, Winnie Rudge. Winnie is a female Scrooge and the book starts out with her doing a remarkably mean thing. Later--much to late--in the book we find out why Winnie is such a mess but by that time you'll no longer care. People don't behave normally in this book. The characters make speeches instead of having converesations and the plot wanders all over the literary map. Is this a take on Christmas Carol? Is it a Jack the Ripper story? Is it a classic ghost story? The author can't seem to make up his mind and so he fails. I didn't like Winnie. I didn't care about her feckless cousin and I just couldn't embrace the story."
1,Lose Lost,"This book stinks! I'm so irritated -- Two hundred pages in and I can 't figure out where the book is going. I not even going to finish it, I don't care how it ends. I was conflicted about the protagonist, Winnie, are we supposed to like her or hate her? This book is all over the place -- adoptions, ghosts in the walls, a missing cousin and Dickens. What is this nonsense? I was so disappointed because his previous two books were SO good. I read about 100 books a year, Wicked is up there in my top 5 all time favorite books. Even Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, not as gripping but still one of those novels you just gobble up. Bypass this one and read his first two books you won't be disappointed"
3,Not what I expected,"I waited eagerly for this book, bought it upon release. This is great writing, however, I was not very prepared for how dramatic a change from `Wicked' and `Confessions' it was. With Lost I was disappointed that Winnie was SO mundane, even when she came so close to almost being engaged is some potentially exciting stuff; the contractors, where's John, Jack the Ripper, and Old' Mr. Scrooge...all just things you find yourself disappointedly rubbernecking as they slide past with out further mention. I am and will continue to be a fan of Maguire's' work. I will eagerly await his next book. I just hope will be satisfied with his next story rather that simply satisfied that I finished the book."
1,Lost in Lost!,"Lost was the first book by MacGuire that I've TRIED to read. Unfortuneately, it will probably be the last. I found this was a difficult read, and I didn't care what happened to the characters. If you've never read MacGuire, don't start with this book!"
4,"""Lost"" is no Hum-bug","At first I was disappointed with ""Lost."" It has a slower start than Maguire's other novels and, at first, it did not seem to be a revision of a classic tale. The book concerns Winifed Rudge, a children's book writer and distant relative of the man claimed to be the basis for Dickens' character Scrooge. When we first meet Winifred, she is a fairly dislikable character. She has no sympathy to spare for anyone; there is no generosity in her. In fact, at one point in the book, another character refers to her as ""Winnie-the-Scrooge."" This is the point of the book. Rather than retell the story of Scrooge in Victorian times, Maguire has placed his Scrooge in modern times and asks some pertinent questions. What makes a person a Scrooge? What is it like to be a Scrooge? How do you stop being a Scrooge? As usual with Maguire's books, the answer to these questions is very interesting and unexpected. It is a novel well worth reading."
3,Not his best.,"I first read Wicked and thought it was an absolutely fabulous book - our entire book club did as well. So, like other reviewers, I was excited about reading his new book. While I agree that there were many plot threads, and things wandered a bit, I was also extremely curious to finish the book and find out what was going to happen. Gregory Maguire is still an excellent writer and the book, while not anywhere near as rich as Wicked, was worth reading."
1,Lost: A Novel by Gregory Maguire,"I was looking forward to reading this book, as I have enjoyed other books by this author in the past. This book was a grave disappointment."
2,mostly forgettable,"Just so you know, this book isn't at all related to the hit TV show Lost.This is just a flat out boring book. After I finished reading it, I'd realized I never even got close to any of the characters, especially Winnie. It was like the whole time I was watching over other people interact with other people, but nothing memorable seems to happen.Another problem- I can't quite figure out what happened in the end. Was Winnie truly a normal person? I don't know and I'm not going back to find out."
1,That's several hours I will never get back :-(,"I haven't read or seen Wicked - i came into this novel with no expectations set by that apparent blockbuster. This looked like a whimsical, imaginative and potentially slighty spooky read - perfect for kicking back with for some light reading on a summer day. well, it IS imaginative and it IS whimsical and, yes, it even IS slightly spooky (in a grotesque sort of way). So why didn't I like it? It never really gets off the ground. The plot itself is decent but the author seems too busy making sure the prose is clever to actually tell the story well. The characters are all, to a man, awful - unlikable but they really know how to turn a phrase. The story is told in a meandering and pointlessly circuitous manner, where better than half of it never develops - and THAT'S the part that is supposed to pull it all together. Yawn!"
1,Awful writing - I just couldn't finish this book,"I'm a passionate and avid reader, and it's not often I choose to abandon a book without finishing it ... but that's exactly what happened with 'Lost'.Other reviewers have already commented on the problems with the storyline(s) and the unpleasant, emotionally detached characters. For me, it was the writing style that really grated - Maguire's intent when writing seems to be to show how erudite and learned he is ... rather than concentrating on what's really important, communicating the story to the reader.I consider myself neither illiterate nor uneducated, but when I have to reach for a dictionary to check the meanings of three separate words in the space of two pages (gelid, cess, emphysematous) - well, all that serves to do is take me out of the story.I can't think of any way in which I would recommend this book (which is a shame as I bought it because I thought it looked like an intriguing tale) so I can really only suggest that you avoid this one."
1,Lost should be considered lost,"I thought this work was pathetic compared with Maguire's other works. I had become a big fan, but I had to struggle to get through this novel that had so much potential. Several teaser plot lines were set up, but none of the interesting ones were followed. What a shame."
4,A THINKING PERSON'S BOOK,"Maguire""s LOST can easily be looked at as having a mixed up story line . After reading this book and thinking through the main elements, it is a great story that brings out the ways guilt is often dealt with. Our thinking often brings out ghostlythoughts that disguise the truth. Read this with some thought and you will appreciate what the author is trying to say."
2,Disappointing,"After WICKED and CONFESSIONS, I bought this book without hestitation. Unfortunately, it failed to meet the expectations created by the earlier books. While filled with Maguire's characteristic delightful prose, the story felt forced and incompletely developed. I never gained that willing suspension of disbelief. The fine prose carried me along, and my positive feelings about the earlier work left me hoping that the book would improve. In the end, I felt dissatisfied. A friend asked, ""What's it about?"" All I could say was, ""I dunno, exactly."" I fear Maguire didn't quite know either."
2,"""Lost"" lost my interest","Undoubtly Maguire is an amazing writer but this novel surely did not captivate me. I couldnt get through it i was so bored with it. I held out farther than i should have thinking it might pick up and become interesting. Much more of a mystery novel than any of his other books which are much more fantasy based.However, to his credit, i do believe that this style was based on another book or writer's style of writing. I do not have the book beside me to verify, but i would not recomend unless you like a novel that takes a long time to piece together and rather slow process of character/plot development."
1,Something went very awry,"Like everyone else, I LOVED WICKED. I bought this book at full hardcover price (silly me!) because of that.I couldn't get interested in the plot of John gone missing, nor Winnie herself as a character. I tried 118 pages, and just gave up because I don't care how it turns out. One of the worst books I've ever attempted to read, and only the second that I've been unable to finish. Buy something else!"
2,Lost,"Gregory Maguire's books 'Wicked' and 'Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister' were wonderful, great reads. However, I found 'Lost'a gread disappointment! It was uninteresting and boring.crc"
3,"No spoilers, interesting, but not memorable.","I loved Wicked, and his next novels were good, but not as great. However, this was interesting, good characters, good mystery and lots of action. The plot seemed to weave along like there was something fantastic going on and then fade into nothingness. I was disappointed that there not many memorable quotations or insightful expressions, but it had it's moments of fun and intrigue, none the less."
2,Lost is simple Lost,"This book was a big let down!! If you are a Gregory MaGuire fan and loved his other books (Wicked, and Confessions...) you will be very disappointed after reading Lost. The main character, Winnie is not likeable and Maguire takes the story all over the place and it never really catches the reader."
1,What happened?????,"I completely agree with the other reviewer who also bought all three of his books in hardcover because his first was so good, and the second was so good, but this third one...WHAT HAPPENED??? I was extremely disappointed. This book was not the caliber I am used to seeing from this author. I hope that whatever went wrong fixes itself before he writes a fourth book."
1,i love maguire but i hate this book,"this book was attrociously written. i am a big fan of maguires works with wicked, confessions of an ugly stepsister, and mirror mirror. this just sucked though.it was boring and incomplete. there wasnt a steady plot for you to follow what the goal or the climax of the book was. it just kept jumping to other things. its like he wrote this book in two minutes. scrooge had nothing to do with the plat and neither did jack the ripper.to top it off the ending was incredibly ridiculous. i mean what was all the run around for? if u read the book youd probably understand my harshness but by all means i was really diassapointed by this work."
1,If only he had lost the manuscript....,"Lost disappoints on every level. From the scarcity of a plot (200 pages of Winifred Rudge feeling sorry for herself, the rest of them everyone telling her she feels sorry for herself), the failed attempt at a convincing tie-in to the Dickens Scrooge character, fluffy, contrived dialog, shallow characters with comic-book level histories and cliche tragedies, to an ending that is...well, not an ending. Instead, the last page happens to arrive before the climax. What is labeled as a ghost story contains 15 pages of actual ghostings.Maguire attempts in Lost to leave behind the fairy-tale parodies that made him famous and offer a book where the characters are more real. Ironically, he offers a book where the characters are less real than their fantasy counterparts.For better novels with a similar tone and subject matter, find a John Irving novel and leave this one on the shelf."
2,"Not ""compulsively readable""","I enjoyed Wicked, and my daughter and I like those of Maguire's children-oriented works that we've read, but this one ""lost"" me. I took a few stabs at it, but it just didn't hold me enough to even finish -- and I almost never give up without finishing a book I've started. Other reviewers have commented that Maguire keeps the reader too distant from the characters and the story, and that he brings in perhaps too many elements to keep the story well focused; I must agree with that. He brings in (jumbles together?) many things and, though I'm generally tolerant of picking through the strands of complicated knots, I wasn't held enough to see the possible payoff as worth the effort. It wasn't terrible (as far as I read), but if I'm going to do the work of slogging through a tough read, there needs to be enough I like that it doesn't seem too much of a chore."
2,So Many Loose Ends,"I'll admit I read this book cover to cover, but it wasn't an enjoyable experience in the end. So many questions left unanswered -- so many dead ends to the different plot lines. I'd write a longer review, but I have already forgotten much of it (it was that unremarkable) and it's only been a week. Winnie's character and the haunter herself (Gervasa) never really let their stories develop fully. It's like Maguire got tired of writing. I am reading ""Confessions"" now -- I'll let you know if it's any better. I don't normally write these as ""anonymous"", but don't want to get flamed -- maybe it was such a ""deep"" book - I just missed something."
2,A writer writes about a writer writes about a writer...,"Unfortunately, Gregory Maguire is no Italo Calvino.He seems to be caught up in a search for cleverness; his multifaceted plot with literary backdrop just never comes alive on the page. The prose is dry and if the story goes anywhere, it hadn't by the time I reached page 163 and gave up. To address some of the praising reviews I noticed -- I think Lost: A Novel is one that only a literary critic could love. (Think David Mitchell's Booker short-listed Cloud Atlas.)"
2,"A Good Read - If You're Not Looking for Another ""Wicked""","Gregory Maguire has a fascinating command of the English language, and a real knack for developing deep and complex characters - something that alone makes this book worth the read. However, this is not the ""Wicked"" or ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"" treatment given to ""A Christmas Carol"", despite what the cover (and familiarity with the author's other popular works) might suggest. If you go into this expecting that, you'll be sadly disappointed.On its own merits, without the context of the rest of Maguire's works, I would probably give this a rating of ""4"". However, I felt betrayed as a reader. There were teasing elements to suggest that this might be a twisted fairytale of sorts, like Wicked, but ultimately any fantastic elements in the book are just red herrings.I think a disclaimer is warranted to warn the unwary reader; I felt deceived, hence a final rating of merely ""2""."
2,Is this really....,"a product of the same author who write ""Wicked""? It doesn't seem so, but it's true! I am not a regular reader of fantasy, but I could not put ""Wicked"" down! ""Lost"" really lived up to it's title--too much meandering, unlikeable characters...read Maguire's other three novels before you turn to this one!"
4,Good Premise Falls Slightly Short,"I have to admit, the cover of this edition is what first caught my attention when I saw this book. Then I read the description on the back and the premise jumped out at me as being very original. I picked this as my first Gregory Maguire book. The premise is this. The main character is supposedly a descendant of the man Dickens based Scrooge on. She returns to England to her great-great-grandfather's house to visit a cousin. Once she arrives, the house is haunted and the adventure begins.I really like Maguire's style of weaving in various legends and fairy tales ranging from Dracula to Peter Pan to Jack the Ripper. I also like how multiple storylines criss-cross the chapters. I was disappointed in the second half of the book though. The merging of the storylines almost seemed like an afterthought, and the story ended with a ""pffft"" instead of with a ""bang"". I would recommend this book to others. Just don't get too worked up during the first part of the book."
2,Not what I expected,"What happened to the Gregory Maguire who wrote ""Wicked""? Surely, this book wasn't from the same author ... but, of course, it was. This book was erratic ... it almost seemed like an amateur wrote it grasping for a storyline. I kept thinking that this book would have to get better or at least make sense, which it never did. The main character is a reporter, then there was something about Ebenezer Scrooge, a ghost in the wall, an orphanage in middle of a snowy desolate area, loving cousins ... I mean, what is going on? If you want a good book by this author, read ""Wicked"" or ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"" but, please, save your time and skip over this book entirely."
3,One step closer to greatness,"I enjoyed reading Lost. Although, I must add that I enjoyed Wicked and Stepsister much more. Maguire has such an interesting writing style; his lead characters so complex. This book with all of it's plot lines past and present, fictional and super-fictional definitely leaves enough room for interpretation. Maguire has such a talent of making us feel something for even the most unlikeable characters (as anyone who read Wicked would know).I tend to be very linear and don't like gaps. That is probably why I did not like this one as much. I like a beginning, a middle and an end, and want to understand everything by the end of the book. I don't have the same feeling with this one. I am looking forward to reading Mirror, and what else Maguire has planned for us in the future."
1,Why did I keep reading?,"I muddled through ""Lost"" for a month before finally finishing it, thoroughly unsatisfied. The main character is so idiotic that I couldn't sympathize with her. Her actions and the actions of the surrounding characters are not the least bit believable, given the course of events. The big interesting question - What is the knocking behind the wall? - is the central and most driving plot point for a short while. It is then ignored for most of the rest of the book, only to be offhandedly explained away with little enthusiasm."
2,Not the best Maguire,"I fell under the Maguire spell a few years back with Wicked and have since managed to cycle through the rest of the ""fairy tale"" novels, with adoration for both the books and the author. Lost, however, isn't quite up to par with Maguire's other tales. While a darker tone didn't bother me, the storyline itself was very slow to develop and diction wasn't optimal either. The quality of Maguire's normal writing just didn't seem to be there. If you're like me, and searching for one last Maguire book to read, pass this one by. It doesn't quite pass the bar."
2,"""Lost"" lost its appeal","I have read both of Maguire's other books and found them both particularly original and refreshing. Upon seeing a new publication, I was ecstatic. That, however, did not last. I feel the book was way too deep in how many storylines were going on at once and that subsiquently made the book hard to follow. I also found it to be a bit of a downer and not at all exciting and attention grabbing, as his other books were. All in all, I was extremely disappointed."
4,My first Maguire book...,"Left me wanting more! Perhaps it was to my advantage not having read any of his previous books, as I found ""Lost"" difficult to put down. There are indeed many layers to the plot, and more than one lost soul involved in the story. Part of the enjoyment for me was untangling the plots and sub-plots, to form a total picture of Winifred's reason for being the way she is."
1,If you love Mirror Mirror and Maguire's brand of fairy tale,"then his will be a huge disappointment Don't waste your money on this book because you wouldn't even know it's the same author. The plot is slow and doesn't even manage to develop by the end of the book. Don't bother. It will leave you saying, ""that was it?"""
2,Lost Me,"Unfortunately Gregory Maguire tried too hard. For two hundred and fifty pages I couldn't close this book. The subtle intermingling of supernatural with plain coincidence left me dying to find out just what would happen to Winnie Rudge. Unlike many other reviewers, for me the fault came not with the intertwining of Scrooge mythology or the narrators fascination with children's literature as both themes were masterfully handled. The problem with this book is that the author,much like his main character, didn't know where the book was going when he started. The last one hundred pages were unbelievable and swiftly undecided. Rather than choosing between the supernatural and a character's dementia he went after both. The result is a good idea poorly executed. To the reader it seems as though Maguire couldn't make up his own mind and the book suffers for it."
2,what a change compared to his 2 other works...blah,"I have read both Wicked and Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister. I found them both unbelievably good and quite entertaining and well written.When I read this book, I was profoundly dissapointed. The story dragged and dragged, the settings were indistinct, and it seems that the first 40 pages served absolutely no purpose. The characters are dry and work against their 'personalities'.I struggled through reading this book. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I like the author."
2,Lost......wish I'd have lost my copy before finishing it...,"Ugh. This book took me almost 4 months to read. It wasn't because I'm a slow reader, it was because I had no interest in the story. None. Zero.As always, Maguire finishes up the story with just a few pages left. But NO, like his other novels, you can't just skip to the end of a Maguire book to catch the end of the story. You have to read the whole dang thing for it to make any sense (which Lost barely did anyway).I'm being generous with the 2 stars, ONLY because the Rudge/Dickens story line and Ritzi (the fruitcake fortune-teller) kept me slightly intrigued. Other than that, Lost went on and on and on about mind-numbing subplot after mind-numbing subplot.Back to the same recommendation I had after reading Confessions: READ WICKED INSTEAD. Sorry, Maguire, this story doesn't get an A from this reader."
2,Lost - I'm lost!,"Gregory Maguire is a very compelling and interesting writer. I loved Wicked and will read it again and again. Ugly was not nearly as captivating. Lost I can't quite get through. I've been reading it for quite some time and it just hasn't enveloped me - dare I say, yet? I'm still reading Lost and if my opinion changes I will write another review.Plea to the Author:Gregory - please go back to your 'Wicked' style!"
2,"Not his best work, go read Wicked again =;)","Lost: A Novel (2/5)Gregory MaguireI was so rabid about Wicked that I was a bit trepidatious about reading this one... unfortunately I was right.Frankly, it wasn't horrible. It wasn't great either. The beginning reminded me of that dream (that everyone has) where you are in a situation that you have no clue what is going on... then slowly you get clue after clue to the situation. Finally you realize that you've forgottennsomething so important (like: you are taking care of the baby (anyone's, not necessarily yours) and you have forgotten to feed it for several days. OR you are in high school again and you can't for the life of you remember your locker combination and you are also late for the exam...well, there's all my neuroses out on display.) and the adrenaline rush wakes you up.I plugged away since Wicked also took a bit of time to get into, but once I was there, I was HOOKED and then I read it again but this one didn't drag me in."
3,Meh...,"Like many others here, I was a let down with this book. The whole Jack the Ripper and Scrooge references felt forced and I was expecting more to come out of those parallels. The story itself held no real surprises and by the end I was hoping Winnie would go through with her plan at the cloister, but of course I knew she wouldn't. Maguire still has a flair for words though; there is no doubt about that. There as some well done passages, and I especially liked the scene during the power outage...very vivid and spooky. So for that I will round UP my 2.5 star rating to 3 stars."
3,Mirror Mirror : A Novel,Good idea but the story was choppy and hard to follow. The constant switching made a lack of flow. I usually read a book in a few days but this took almost two weeks due to the lack of flow. But I love this writer's previous books.
1,Callous toward Adoptive Parents,"As an adoptive parent, I realize that I may be a little sensitive toward the portrayal of the adoption process- a long and agonizing wait for a potential child. The adoption process and some-not all-adoption agencies have much that should be changed (bribes in foreign countries, high prices here in the States, red tape, emotional manipulation) but I was really put off by the author's presentation of pre-adoptive parents as all being disfunctional. Once again, I realize this is only a novel (and not a very well reviewed one, either) but it reveals a certain callousness about and/or unfamiliarity with the heartbreaking process of adoption. Where are the bounds of good taste today? in the cancer ward or the neonatal ICU unit? Needless to say, I didn't read very far. We sent this book and the others by this author back to Amazon."
1,"The fun is ""Lost""","I bought ""Lost"" hoping it would be as clever and interesting as ""Wicked"". I ripped through the book looking for the fun, but finished before it appeared. Best to choose a differnt book."
1,Lost is the right name for this book!,"Let me first start off by saying that, I am usually a Terry Maguire Fan. Everything about this book was Lost, the main character Winnie, the plot, me, and the usual Terry Maguire spin. He touches up Jack the Ripper and Dracula, but really the focus should have been on the haunting of Ozias Rudge how that paralleled Dickens and Winnie herself. Winnie would almost become endearing then act completely out of character. Few other characters were formed the way Terry usually allows. The only thing that really fit was the title.I think if you skip this book you won't be Lost for it."
4,Lost,The book actually came a lot quicker than I thought. It was in good condition and the packaging wasn't bad. I'd definitely buy from this seller again.
2,Disappointing,"I had a very difficult time getting into this book, and the pay off in the end just isn't there. The language is pretty good, though, and there are a lot of original ideas- I could not predict what was going to happen next at any point."
2,Unfortunately disappointing.,"Yes, yes I have read Wicked & Stepsister. Yes Wicked is one of my favorite books. But this review is about Lost. And that is exactly what it is.It wasn't until the last 1/10th of the book that I got interested in the story at all. And even that didn't last, as I thought the ending was dreadful. This book does not live up to the storytelling and writing that Gregory Maguire is known for. The story is halfhearted and not fully explained. Many of the long, rambly descriptive paragraphs in the book are confusing and leave the feeling that Maguire has either lost his mind himself or has lost grasp of the English language all together.I finished Lost feeling cheated and disappointed. Lost does not live up to it's own author."
1,"if there was a ""no star"" rating...","this book would get it from me. Like many other reviewers here, I too read ""Wicked"", and ""Confessions..."" and found them to be entertaining and creative. ""Lost"" however has to be the worst book I have ever read to date. I found myself getting increasingly annoyed just trying to get to the torturous end of the story, and when I was done I wanted to throw the book away! I actually feel I lost brain cells reading this book!"
3,LOST--GREGORY MAGUIRE,"""Lost"" is a novel about an aspiring author--Winnie Rudge--that travels to London to write a novel about a woman who is being haunted by the ghost of Jack the Ripper. Her ancestor is supposedly where Dickens got the idea for Ebenezer Scrooge. But she herself gets caught up in a mystery... While staying at her cousin's house, she hears somthing behind the walls. And where is her cousin? Could the tapping be his dead spirit? Or maybe even the ghosts that haunted Scrooge? But when she tears down the wall, she finds something suprising...This darkly humorous novel had a great plot idea, but with a confusing ending and hard-to-understand prose, it made the book fall apart. Don't read this if you are expecting a fun read or a happy ending. But don't give up on Gregory Maguire--""Confessions of An Ugly Stepsister"" and ""Wicked"" shows he really does have a true talent!"
2,Truly LOST!!!!!!!!,"I had a lot of hope for this book when I started. With the cover art and the description, I expected something more along thelines of a ghost story with literary connections, etc. Well, lets just say this piece of ""work"" does not know where it is going. The ghost story I was hoping for was incomplete and garbled. And what is the point of the whole Scrooge storyline?Maguire could have just as easily left Scrooge out of it and it wouldn't effect the plot a whole lot. I guess Maguire just has to have some literary gimmick.I was left scratching my head at the end of it. I felt a little cheated or perhaps more accurately, mislead. The book isn't horrible but it just isn't worth the effort."
1,Disapppointing ......,"I loved Confessions and think Wicked was brilliant- so much detail, passion and suspense. I couldn't wait to read Lost! What a disappointment. It reads like a romance novel at times. I felt like he had to get something to the publisher and wrote this the weekend before. He is a better writer than Lost! Read Wicked instead (or again) and skip this one. It will only turn you off to a great writer that needs to get back to what he is good at."
2,Not in the same league as Wicked and Confessions,"I was terribly disappointed in this book, which comes nowhere close to the pleasures offered by Maguire's two excellent previous novels. With its hodgepodge of allusions to Peter Pan, Jack the Ripper, A Christmas Carol, etc., all painfully forced, the story goes nowhere interesting, and the central character never comes into sharp focus. She was neither likable nor dislikable. And the author's attempt to inject English flavor into the narrative seemed very self-conscious. I still regularly recommend Wicked and Confessions of an Ugly Step-Sister, but it was obviously a mistake to assume that Maguire's future works would necessarily reach the high standards set by those two books."
1,Gave up.,"Wow, this book stinks. I keep telling myself to ""hang in there, it will get better."" but it hasn't, and I'm tired of being bored. Finally made it to page 100 and I'm a fast reader. I have not been the least bit captivated, I give up!"
1,Cannot finish this book,"I have been trying to plow through this book for awhile; I think I purchased it close to 2 years ago. Although Maguire wrote one of my very favorite books (Wicked), because of books like this, he is not one of my favorite authors. The story drags, it is boring, and simply fails to draw the reader in. This is one of the very few book I've started adn never finished. Just awful."
2,Disappointing,"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Having read ""Wicked"" and ""Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister"", I was looking forward to reading another of Maguire's imaginative works. However, ""Lost"" seems to be just that. Nothing really fits together in this novel, and Maguire had the opportunity to develop the Scrooge storyline wonderfully, but instead chose to go with an unknown ghost and theme of incest. It was, by far, the worst novel I have read this year."
3,Mediocre at best,"I usually eat up Gregory Maguire books in a day or two. _Lost_ took me longer and I don't think that it was because I was busy. This book plodded along and I kept on hoping it would get better or at the very least pick up.Others have discussed the plot, so I won't bother doing so.This book is slow and you'll find yourself trudging through it hoping maddingly (haha) that it will improve.Read _Wicked_ or _Mirror, Mirror_, which were both excellent."
2,"""Lost"" is aptly named...","""Lost"" is aptly titled, because the reader feels lost for the first two thirds of the novel. In the final third, you discover some answers, but find they weren't really answers worth knowing. This novel is written in the third person but the point of view is first person, which leaves the reader feeling confused, muddied, and, well, lost. While I realize this may have been the point, it really doesn't work here. Finally, I don't think the author really understands women, which is unfortunate, since the protagonist and many of the characters are female. They all end up feeling underdeveloped and stilted, caricatures of real women. Their dialogue is inexplicable in some cases, and often downright rude for no apparent reason. Frankly, I was very disappointed. Get this one from the library if you must read it, or wait for the paperback. Better yet, take out your copy of ""Wicked"" and re-read that instead."
2,Don't really like it,"I LOVED ""Wicked"". Liked ""Son of a Witch"" ""Lion Among Men"" really wrapped it all up. ""Confessions of the Ugly Step Sister was wonderful..Loved it. Lost??? I was disappointed. I tried. I read it all the way through. I really didn't like it. Sorry"
2,I got 'lost' with this book,"I had a lot of trouble with this book, and only finished it after three-false starts. Every time I picked it up, I quickly lost interest in the characters and the meandering story that seemed to go nowhere over the course of a 100 pages.It starts well enough, with a rapt car crash observed by the protagonist followed by an interesting scene in an adoption agency. The main character leaves for England to visit a relative, only to find him missing--sort of. Then, the story stops and wallows in itself for page upon endless page.I purchased this book along with Wicked, having loved the musical adaptation of the latter. And though friends' tell me they've loved Wicked, I'm worried about investing any more time in another Gregory Maguire book because of Lost."
2,"difficult to follow, not wonderful like other Maguire books","Similar to other reviewers, I started this book with high hopes since I have enjoyed all of the other books I have read by Gregory Maguire. Sadly, I came to the conclusion that he was under a deadline to write it (projecting that feeling onto the main character who has writer's block) and just wrote the book as a stream-of-consciousness brainstorm. It never solidifies into a cohesive storyline.My recommendation would be: don't let Lost turn you off from other Gregory Maguire books! I've loved Wicked, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister, and Mirror Mirror. I've just picked up Son of Witch and I'm already caught up in it."
1,Skip this for Wicked!,"I didn't realize I had grown so attached to my Kindle! I got to the airport and almost cried when I realized I had forgotten it by my bedside. Chin up; I rushed into the bookstore looking for something to read on my long journey. Having read Wicked, I figured Lost was a good bet. Well, it was... lost???... from beginning to end! It just rambled and rambled! Eighteen hours of flight and no Kindle to move on to something else, I had no choice but to read on in hopes that it would get better. It didn't! Skip this, go for Wicked.One star for the illusion that something was going to happen and make the suffering through worth the effort."
3,Average...looking for all the fanfare.,"This was the first Maguire book I've read (halfway through What-the-Dickens, prereading it prior to giving it to my 9-year-old daughter). I must say that it does not live up to the fanfare that Wicked and others (e.g. Ugly Stepsister) have received. From reading those reviews, it seems like Lost was a different kind of book, i.e. not laced with so much fairy tale. The relativity to the historical/literary characters was hinted to, but not developed very much. I guess that's what I was expecting. The first 3/4 was better than the last bit, which seemed to drag on a bit. It was okay, and a good read, but simply not what I was expecting."
3,mildly entertaining,"I like the way this author writes, absolutely. I like the story, I like the setting... but what happens when the main character annoys the CRAP out of you?She's a writer researching her next book, which has a lead character with a similar name to hers, only very stupid sounding. It's almost like this isn't Macguire's fault. He wrote the character with so much realism that I actually believe this main character is at fault. She's just STUPID. Maybe he meant her to be that way?Either way it was a decent book, just be prepared to find Winnie to be very pathetic and annoying."
3,Crazy,"I don't think this book was bad, nor do I think it was Gregory Maguire's best. I liked it, though. He, as usual, makes interesting points in his writing. This book is about how ""lost"" we all are in the world, and about a trying to lead the little lost souls of children to some sort of home. The only way one can accomplish this is by finding him or herself. Deep, which is par for the course for Maguire. Many people will be put off by the style and plot, though. In a word, the book is crazy. It's been a long time since I read the book, but I remember it being very, very weird. But, give it a chance. You might miss something if you don't."
2,Mad at myself for buying this book,"Wicked was good, not great, just good, so when I saw this book on sale for $4, I thought, why not. I wish I would have just thrown my money away. This book is shallow and unimaginative, written as if the author hurrily threw it together to ride in the wake of Wicked. None of the characters, especially the main character, are given any personality or depth. The book starts off at its zenith, then falls quickly. Do not read this book."
2,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!,"First of all, I always use neoprene seat covers in my daily driver and I have always payed as little as possible for them. The last pair I got at Wall Mart for $45 bucks (a pair) and they lasted 6 years. When I ordered these (Allison 65-8736RED Neoprene Seat Covers) I thought they'd be comparible.Surprise!! Where do I Begin?Pros1 Low Price2 They look good the first day.Cons1 The back and sides are made of thin nylon (one grade above pantyhose) that runs when you stretch it.2 The fastening straps are too short (so you have to stretch the nylons) and are so thin the slip out of the buckles.3 The best part is the ""Neoprene"" is already wearing out. (It's been 2 weeks!)Unless your car has a ""For Sale"" sign in the window, run screaming from this product and Allison in general."
5,Hours and hours of delightful music,"Anyone who enjoys listening to classical music for relaxation in the evening knows how disappointing ""classical music"" radio stations can be. Sometimes it seems that their post-drivetime playlists are devoted to the ugliest and most avant garde compositions ever to assault the ear -- even (or perhaps especially!) here in New York City. For precisely this reason I recently purchased a 5-CD changer and several of these Philips CD collections of Mozart's works. It is an investment I would heartily recommend to all lovers of good music. What a pleasure it is to put five of these CDs into the changer, push the ""Play"" button, and enjoy one's evening hours listening to these beautiful divertimenti. If you're looking for quality recordings of Mozart's works at an affordable price, look no further than the Philips Collection. You won't be disappointed here!"
3,some questions in assembly were not clear,Once we had it assembled it was nice. Instructions are not as clear as they could be. It is sturdy. Overall recommend.
1,Crib is not flexible to assemble.,This crib has got lots of screws and bolts.Its not friendly to assemble it. It is taking hell lot of time to assemble it. Once you assemble its very difficult to dismantle it.I would recommend to go for wood type of cribes.
2,Would be a 5 star drive except...,IT'S TOO FREAKIN' LOUD! Try using software that requires a CD to run and this drive will drive you up a wall. I almost filed an extension when using TurboTax so I could go get a new drive.
5,LIGHTNING SPEED,IF YOUR GONNA BY A BURNER AND YOU HAVE THE MONEY. BUY THIS. YOU CAN RECORD A CD IN LESS THEN 5 MINUTES. ALSO WITH THERE NEW WRITE PROOF TECHNOLOGY U WILL NEVER WASTE TIME WITH COMMON UNDERUN ERRORS. THAT MEANS EVERY CD YOU MAKE COMES OUT PERFECT.
2,Firmware bugs still a problem,"I read the reviews here but hoped that by december Yamaha would have resolved the firmware bugs that are causing the drive to not work well on many systems. Well, not yet, I got a build from November 2000, downloaded the December firmware update and the Adaptec software update, but at least on my Win2000 system, the drive had problems reading some CD's (including 2 of the 3 software CD's that came with the drive), would spontaneously ""unplug"" itself, and could not write a CD. This was not a problem with the IDE settings or DMA. So best to wait for another firmware update unless you're prepared to take a chance. I returned it and am very happy with the replacement, a Plextor 12/10/32."
4,It works great for me,"I bought the Yamaha 16-10-40 even after reading the bad reviews that some people gave it. Some people said that you need a supper computer to run this thing, and that it is terribly noisy. It does get louder than your average drive, but only when it is doing certain tasks. Other than that it has been perfect. I have a 2 year old pc with an intel celleron 400 processor and I have burned discs at x16 speed, plus I did not even have to upgrade any drivers, or firmware. I was burning my first cd within 30 minutes of opening the box."
4,Not too bad at all...,"I have had good success thus far with this burner. It is indeed fast, burning at 16x no problem. Though I had nothing but trouble with the adaptec software that shipped with it -- could not burn a thing, so I uninstalled it and went with Nero and haven't had a major problem since. With the rebate, this is definitely a good deal."
3,"Save your money, get a Plextor","I read the reviews on this and took my chance, wish I would have gotten a Plextor instead. It's fast to burn mp3 music to a cd but when you want to copy a disk, it goes down all the way to 4x recording. Just downloaded the drivers to see if that improves. Like I said, get the Plextor instead"
2,fast but...,"I had a mostly bad experience.The Good: It is the fastest drive for sale at the store. It was pretty easy to install the drive, Adaptec software, and make CD-R and CD-RW data discs.The Bad: When I tried to use the CD Creator tool to record a new audio CD-R, an error told me the drive was already in use by Adaptec DirectCD. I tried to stop and uninstall DirectCD. Eventually I went to the Yamaha support web site and downloaded the latest firmware.The Ugly: When I ran the firmware upgrade, it hung half way through and left my system unstable. Since the drive was no longer recognized at all by Windows 98, I decided to return it for a refund.Maybe I did something wrong. It was my first CD-R drive. However my next drive will not be a Yamaha drive."
2,Worked well for first few months,"My CRW2100E drive worked pretty well for first few months. On around the 7th month, I started to experience some problems...the drive would not read/write CD's occassionaly. On the 8th month, the it failed completely. I do not burn alot of CD's. I burned around 80 CD's only during the lifespan of that drive.In the end, found out that the problem was with the laser unit of the drive....which was probably caused by the drive not being well-balanced. I would not recommend this drive to a friend."
3,Average CDRW at a resonable price,"I was shopping around for an internal cdrw with many known brands in consideration. After reading the review here and taking the current huge $... rebate into account, I finally decided to buy this product. At first, not to mention the huge noise coming from the drive and it sometimes makes me feel like something is not right. Sometimes the copying works with no problems but sometimes it doesn't. Then when I restart my pc and try again, then it works. Sometimes it just gives me strange error when my original and recordable media have no problem at all. But about 80% of the times it makes a good copy. So at around $... after rebate, it's still a good deal."
2,"Noisy, miss-burns, DAE not as advertised...","The drive performs as advertised in very few scenarios. I have not gotten my drive to work well with Win 2000 and Roxio, however works perfectly with NERO 5.5 The drive does have the annoying habit of spinning up with a lot of noise for the slightest task. I did not reach DAE of 40x, I didn't break 10x with the software supplied with the drive. However benchmarking software put the drive in the 27x range something I have not been able to come close to with any ripping software.Closing: The drive can perform very well when tweaked correctly, however it is a pain to get there..."
3,It drove me crazy!!!,"I bought this unit about two weeks ago and it drove me crazy. I read some bad reviews about it like software and firmware problem . So, as a computer guy, I said to myself, I can fix it. I bought it because I like its speed. Let me tell you, I was in for a surprise. I had so much problems installing it. I tried all posibilities. Finally, I had to return the unit to exchanged another one. On top of that, I had to load the WIMme in order to make it work. I went through hell just to make it work. It's working fine now, and I must say it's fast. The question is, do you want to take this chance to see if it would work on your system? If you have to get a fast drive, this is it. However, I would suggest a slower drive on other brand."
4,"Great, but not the best!","This rewriter is very good in terms of for your basic CD copying and so on. It says it offers buffer underrun protection with 8MB of memory but if you do a copying directly from disc-to-disc, you would still get buffer underrun error. I had some failed copying due to this error. The best way I found to be successfully making copies would be to copy to harddrive first then copy to your blank disc. This way has proven no problem to me so far, although it takes longer to do it. This device does sound very loud but it shouldn't be a big problem if you don't mind it. It's all-around above average rewriter and it's good for its price. The new ones with faster speed should be a good buy with decent price."
1,Avoid this one,"This product is plagued with problems. The very loud sound is the least of it's problems. I have Win2K. Using the drive just to play CDs freezes the system for several seconds any time you insert a new CD.The CD burning software is very flaky. It has lots of bugs and does not recover well from abnormal shutdowns. Have to reinstall it. Occasionally, while buring a CD the whole system crashes halfway through the process."
1,Don't get it! You know better!,"Bleeding edge technology == BAD!This drive doesn't hold up, it doesn't work. I have installed the updates, but it's been showing up saying all my media is bad (including the cd-r it came with). So hours later blah blah blah... same old story, it doesn't work. It reads just fine I know it's setup right I setup the software off the drive, it does not write.I have owned a 2x CD-RW drive for nearly 2 years up until I sold it a year ago. 1 year has gone buy and I felt the need to have one again, so I chose this one.Do not get this product! Yamaha does NOT have a good name in the CD-RW industry... instead try plextor or HP. Reliability is extremely important, too bad I have wasted my time, I hope you can save yours."
1,Not recommended,"As many others have noted, this drive is extremely noisy, not very well balanced, and mine failed 1 week after the warranty expired. I would not recommend this drive."
1,Pay attention to the reviews.,Those who say this Recorder is great DON'T mention it's rewriting capabilities.THIS RECORDER DOESN'T REWRITE AT 10X EVEN WITH PROPER MEDIA.I don't care if it's a firmware problem or what. I've seen Goldstar recorders performing better that Yamaha's. I'm returning mine as soon as possible.
5,Works for Me!,"I have read some reviews where people have had problems with this drive or the software/firmware. I recently purchased this drive and I have had NO problems. The Adaptec software it comes with makes CD-making a breeze. I made my first Audio CD from a collection of my favorite CD tracks by ""clicking and dragging."" The program even automatically opened the CD tray and told me when it was time to insert the CD with the next track for recording - what could be easier than that? I did the self test as suggested in the documentation and the drive met or exceeded the advertised 16x/10x/40x speeds. I installed it in a relatively new DELL 1GHz PIII system and it was plug and play all the way for me - no software, hardware or compatibility problems whatsoever. I REALLY like this drive."
2,I've Seen Better,Well i had no luck with this Burner... I think i recieved a defective one. It screwed up my system and wouldn't read blank CD's as being Blank. I was not impressed with it's 8 meg buffer either. I was getting buffer underuns while only running the burner. I have a pretty powerful system and it shouldn't have been doing this. I returned the burner to amazon. maybe it will work better for you
3,Decent but could be better,"I installed this drive thinking it would work well to begin with, but had problem with DMA with win98. It always froze when reading a cd. Tech-support gave me the run around. Eventually, after a week, i bought winME. Drive works perfectly now. Burns cd's in less than 5 min. Wish Yamaha had some better support for this. Oh well."
2,Very loud!,"I bought this drive thinking I was getting a quality product from Yamaha, what a mistake. It installs without any problems & the software bundle is slightly above average but this drive is incredibly loud. It played & burned cd's as advertised but I couldn't get over the noise. High speed cd players don't need to be this noisy. I returned it & got a Plextor PlexWriter. This drive is whisper quite. In my opinion, go with the Plextor even if you must buy a slightly slower model you won't be sorry with Plextor's quality. Their's a reason Plextor's the most popular."
1,"Brand New Computer, Brand New Burner, Brand New Problems.","I have a Dell Dimension 8100 which we had gotten for Christmas last year. Soon after I bought the 2100EZ. Installation was nice and easy, but it decided that it didn't want to burn at 16X. It would only do 16X. So when calling tech-support they told me that I was doing a lot better than most people were with this product and that I should be happy with 12X. You make up your mind whether you want this product. Especially with the new 24X burners costing the same price."
4,Great Drive...Fast...but alittle bit noisey,"I have owned this drive for about a year, and has never failed to burn a CD-R at 16x. Even with CD-R's that were rated for 12x, they burned at 16x.The only thing that bugs me alittle is that the Drive can get alittle bit noisey when spinning up, and reading CD's. If the drive was quieter, it would diffenitly get 5 stars.If your a new person to Burners...the software that came with it is good for average use...but like another person said...for serious Burning go and buy Nero Burning Rom."
1,hardware tests,No burn-proof ! Dont buy this one !- Not true 10x re-write drive Failed to read 10x HS RW written media - Bad packet writing performance - You need fast PC for enjoy it! - Noise when reading at max speed
2,Disappointed,"I've had this burner since December, and I'm not impressed. Ii'm running windows me, and the software is very touchy. I get a lot of system freezes and some long waits. The drag and drop features for audio CD's is great, so long as my system doesn't lock up. It's not terrible, but I could've saved a lot of money by buying a slower one that doesn't lock up my computer."
1,This Drive Is A Waste Of Time AND Money,"I bought One of these drives and after six calls to tech support they told me to take it back becuase it was defective, but since they have told me my problem is six different things I am having a hard time believing tech support. The problem I had they kept telling me should never happen on Win2K, hey guess what it was and they can't figure it out. Well I am taking it back and NOT getting another Yamaha."
5,Excellent drive,"After ordering this drive I read some of the reviews and was a little concerned, but this was unfounded. Following the instruction with the drive I had it installed and burning at 16x in about 10 minutes and have not made a single coaster yet. This is an excellent drive and I highly recomend it!"
5,Stable and Fast drive,"We've been using two of these drives here at RTKL Digital Solutions for about 6 months ..., with nothing but GREAT results. We have never had a bad write yet, and we write a whole lot of CD-R's. When I saw ... unbeatable price, I jumped on it to replace my ageing 4x Yamaha drive at home. Great drive at the BEST price I've found. I have to say, ""buy it!"""
1,Yamaha burner a piece of ...,"I bought one and then returned it 2 days later. I am very experienced burning CDs - I have 3 burners (2 EIDE and 1 SCSI) and have and use both Nero and Adaptec software. I was unable to make a copy, or create a music CD compilation from .wav files. I tried everything. A dozen coasters later I returned it. Get a drive with Burn Proof. My 12x Lite-on CD-R with Burn Proof is blazingly fast and very reliable. I own other Yamaha equip. and like it but was very disappointed with their CD-R."
5,Dream Work - an enlightenment to show you the way!,"If Dream Work was composed only of one poem - Wild Geese- it would receive 5 stars! In this poem alone Mary Oliver captures the heart of our souls. It is my ""mantra""."
5,Touching reality,"I will be teaching language arts. I plan to use Mary Oliver in the classroom to get students interested in poetry. She writes in such a down to earth manner that she can be understood and discussed by people who aren't really ""into poetry"". Oliver gives us a new angle to look at the world with - but one that can be related to easily."
2,Very introductory and lacks consistency,"This book tries to be ambitious and all it accomplishes is to convey scattered, imprecise and shallow information to the beginner. There may be a few handy topics, but it is all there is. It lacks consistency. The CD-ROM contents are ridiculous. If the reader is interested in learning Oracle and UNIX, I would suggest buying specific books on both products, or even attending some courses."
1,Don't waste you money,"Since I am only a novice to the Oracle Database administration, I don't suggest anyone to take this book. It just summarizes the concept of Oracle database very roughly, let alone the UNIX. To my regret, it seems there is no much choice to find another book dealing with UNIX AND Oracle at the same time.Hope there will be such a great book that can really help."
1,Section on Backup / Recovery is wrong,"The section on Backup / Recovey (one of the most important tasks of a DBA) is wrong. It is stated that during a recovery from cold backup, data entered between the time of the last backup and the time when the database was restored is lost. If using archive mode (which most production systems use), you can recover up to the point of failure with a cold or hot backup."
2,Scratches the surface of the DBA knowledge base.,"A quick glace through the book will quickly reveal how lightly it treats the complex issues of Oracle database administration. Not a serious reference. Unfortunately, the CD that is included with the book is hardly much better. Save your money."
3,Useful book; leave the CD in its jacket,"It is thin but useful. If you can believe the first bullet on the cover ""Requires no prior DBMS experience"", and you feel confident that you can install, configure, and administer Oracle by using this guide only, then you're a fool. If your Oracle resides on UNIX, and you're the DBA, yes, add this to your book shelf if you're not UNIX savvy. Otherwise, expect to get half of what you pay for and only use half of what you get."
4,Remember The Alamo,"Cutting Horse film is filled with beauty. Beautiful landscape, gorgeous horses and very well shot. I don't know how many people like me sat through the Big budget, overpayed actor filled film The Alamo. Now that film to me was torture, because I expected ""something"" that wasn't delivered. If you're looking for a fast-paced MTV-generation Western, then you need to buy a Hollywood movie like The Alamo. But if you like old spaghetti Westerns about ""Real character"" set in beautiful landscapes then this is your film."
1,Awful!,"This was possibly the worst film I've ever had to sit through. The plot was ridiculous, the acting was terrible; the horses were the only things worth seeing. The editing was so bad, it made the cutting scenes not even worth watching. Do not waste your hard-earned money on this one unless you have people you don't like over for dinner."
2,There's very little cutting,"If you don't know, cutting is a great sport and a good cutting horse is a true athlete and as smart as they come. So with a title like this movie has, you'd expect to really see some good horsemanship. Unfortunately, there isn't much here. This is a B-rated movie that I would have been happy with if it showed some good cutting and lived up to its title. It didn't. There's very little actual cutting, very little about cutting, and on the whole it was a big disappointment. If you must see this, rent it, don't buy it. You won't be watching it twice."
2,Pure torture.,"The only decent actors in this movie were those of the equine variety. Sitting through this movie was like a session of Chinese water torture -- I was just too embarassed for the actors, and disgusted by the generally disjointed film sequences. If you can tolerate choppy and unenthusiastic acting, incredibly lame sound effects, and lingering scenes that have absolutely no significance in the overall scheme of things, then by all means, buy this movie."
2,Beautiful California,This movie is very pretty to look at. It shows California landscape at its best. Trying watching this film with the sound turned off.
4,Entertaining,"There are other books that make the argument for a Planetary Superorganism better, for example, Peter Russell's The Global Brain Awakens and Gregory Stock's Metaman, but this one makes the argument in the most entertaining manner."
4,Quintessential literature,"I'm working my way through the entirity of Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse series, and I must admit that Dexter really has a talent of working his words into reality. One will sit in a chair, reading a Morse novel, and will suddenly find oneself in the scene, with Morse, with Lewis, with the excitement that comes with any Morse novel. Dexter brings you to quintessential England, Oxfordshire, the whisky that so many of his beautiful characters enjoy, and the life of the curious genius Inspector Morse.If you like detective novels, but want to be brought into a state of utter reality, having forced upon you the very scene that the fantastic write Dexter is describing, go for a Morse novel. This book will aid you in finding out about Morse and the scenes, and I hope that any willing reader will enjoy reading these exciting novels.4 stars with a smile."
3,Great content but. . . .,"I like this book a lot. We are stone Morse fans in our house and David Bishop's ebook gets plenty of re-reading here.Since this is a reference book (for us, anyhow), we need an annotated interactive table of contents.We can do word searches of course but it is tedious to find a particular book or episode without bookmarking every one. Especially if we don't remember the exact title.Amazon, you can do better!"
1,Better Software is Available--Keep Looking,"I was truly dissapointed with this software. If I could have rated it negative 5 I would have. I expected more from Sesame Street. Not only did this CD interfere with the proper operation of my PC--causing it to lock up, freeze, and distort my monitor screen, I found it totally ineffective. The games are difficult to interact with, and there is NO ABILITY TO INCREASE THE SKILL LEVELS. There is no assessment of my childs skill, but rather, a stupid assessment of the ""games."" After my son (age 3) had mastered the concepts, there was no way to increase the difficulty level to keep him interested. I feel it was a waste of my money. My son loves Jump*Start's Preschool CD which gives me as a parent, more control over skill levels, and it's much easier for my son to navigate through the games. I'd say if you're considering Get Set To Learn! you should keep looking. Sign me--Ripped Off By Seasame Street!"
4,Book served it's purpose and more,"Used this book for a college level writing class on technical communication. The book has a chapter on everything you need to know from writing a memo to creating a formal report. Along with a good APA/MLA reference book, you'll have no trouble creating impressive documents in any line of work."
3,Servant bounces back but this ISN'T the live album we wanted,"Following the disappointing WORLD OF SAND, Servant returned to what they do best, power pop rock songs. There had been rumors at the time that this was going to be a ""live"" album because of the title, and when it was released, most were pleased to have an album of brand new studio tracks. Maybe next time for the live release? (It never happened.)""Tied Down"" ""Burning Bridges"" ""Heart to Heart"" ""Holding On To You"" and ""Fall Out""are probably the ""best"" songs on this impressive 4th album, with Servant attempting to incorporate more of the new wave/keyboard style into their music. The sound takes them away from the rock foundation they had built but they certainly had the 80s sound down tight. Sandi Brock's vocals are the best of all the albums--she really is allowed to ""sing"" on this one and her vocal shading had some much needed nuance to this tracks."
3,Ultron Displeases,"In addition to the overall body and head being different than the classic Ultron of comics, the elbow joints are unusually stiff and in some cases unable to be moved without breaking the arm. It's too bad b/c Ultron is a great villain."
5,Companion for EWTN programs today,"Many people think modern media and Pads signal the end of books - not so.While I love EWTN and the DVDs they produce, at times I want to stop and dig into a particular issue:The Pictorial History of Catholicism, 1962 Philosophical Library by Marian Mckenna (assistant Professor of History Manhattanville College) is one such book. The Pictorial consists mainly of photos from museums, however, the text - The Apostolic Age .... in the Twentieth Century - is the meat of this book. Note: carries imprimatur of Francis Cardinal Spellman.Got book (8 5/8 x 11 1/4) with DJ in Good condition for under $ 10 from Amazon in Feb 2011."
1,"Right idea, but not too sturdy...",I bought this to support a couple of small bird feeders on my deck rail. Come spring we had a minor storm with some wind and the weld for the clamp broke. The clamp is only spot welded in one place and is quite weak. Now when I replace my hook I can buy a couple of new bird feeders to replace the two that broke when it fell apart...
4,Music as relaxing as it is diverse,"The various works included in ""Acoustic Sampler #5"" range from the gentle piano of ""Secret Garden"" to the multicultural music of ""Opal Moon"" to the evocative guitars of ""La Couronne"" (my personal favorite). For those who consider beautiful music an antidote to the stress of their hectic lives, this CD is recommended."
2,Struggle to the end,"I bought the Pitchers story at half price books for around $5.50, after scanning it I thought it might make a good read. The reality was that at times I had to labor to get through to the end of the book, sort of what David Cone's last year as a Yankee was. The book had some good moments but Angell who wanted to write about Cone's craft as a pitcher ended up instead being a recount of his last season with the Yankees and a reflection of his childhood and baseball life up to that point. Angell like Cone did the best he could and struggled to the end.When I returned the book to half price books they gave me a dollar back. So I guess you can say it was not a complete lost."
3,AN OK BOOK,THIS STORY OF DAVID CONE IS A DECENT READ. I FOUND MYSELF DAY DREAMING DURING SOME OF THIS BOOK FOR IT DIDN'T HOLD MY INTEREST ALL THAT MUCH. MR. CONE HAS OVERCOME A VERY SERIOUS BLOOD CLOT AND A VERY EMBARASSING LAST SEASON WITH THE YANKEES. (ALTHOUGHT HE PITCHED SOLIDLY FOR THE RED SOX LAST YEAR. HE HAS HAD SOME GREAT SEASONS AND IS ONE OF THE BETTER PITCHERS IN THE 80'S AND 90'S. BUT THIS COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER. TOO MUCH TIME WASTED ABOUT HIS LAST SEASON. TOO BAD MR. ANGELL DIDN'T SPEND MORE TIME RELIVING HIS DAYS WITH THE METS AND MORE OF HIS GOOD YEARS WITH THE YANKEES. CONE DESERVES BETTER THAN THIS SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE BOOK.
3,Could have been something special,"The original premise of the book, in which the first few chapters dealt with the emotional chess game between pitcher and batter, and who better than from an emotional pitcher out of New York. But once Angell, got away from this, and wanted to write about the twilight years of a great clutch pitcher, he ended up with just another jock bio. But I must admit I did walk away from the book with more repect for Cone, and I really have no affiliation with the New York Teams."
2,Late Innings,"Aging veteran writer Roger Angell spends the 2000 season with aging veteran pitcher David Cone. Cone struggles with injuries and mechanics to produce a sub-par 4-14 record. Angell struggles with the project in general, producing A Pithcer's Story. Anyone who's enjoyed Roger Angell's previous baseball writing knows that his forte is explaining the game through it's players, relaying anecdotes that give us a sense of being inside the game, and putting the current events of baseball in their historical context. When A Pitcher's Story allows for these moments, Angell shines (see chapters Normal Pain and This Statesman). Unfortunatly, the format (following David Cone through a season) doesn't really allow for this. Maybe David Cone wasn't the right head to get into, maybe Roger Angell wasn't the right guy to try. In either case I hope they can both put the 2000 season behind them and give us one more good year."
5,Blue Ribbon Winner,"I loved this book. It helped my 10 year old friend win hir first ribbon in a county fair. She was able to do the recipe all by herself. Have bought 2, am buying more for my grandchildren."
3,"Creative and Fun, but Ms. Crespo keeps her trade secrets to herself.","There are loads of beautiful photos and great ideas in this book. However, the instructions are vague and in some cases, just don't work as planned.The jello fish bowl is a great example of this. The recipe calls for Berry Blue jello, which is too dark and cloudy to see through. You will never have something that looks like the photograph. Time and again fruit salad does not sink to the bottom to create the gravel.In this book as well as Hello Cupcake, it seems that certain secrets to making photo perfect treats are left out. While you will find loads of inspiration, you may also find frustration with these recipes."
1,Tankograd's new Leo 2 book is a better value,"There is nothing wrong with this Osprey title if you are paying original list price or less and you just need a short well written general history of the vehicle through 1998. However, you would be insane to pay the current lowest new/used price of close to $50(as of 7Aug09). A 2009 Tankograd book by Frank Lobitz ""Kampfpanzer Leopard 2: Leopard 2 Main Battle Tank Development and German Army Service"" covers the Leo 2 in much better detail and includes the most recent variants. Frank Lobitz's new book lists at $85US, which maybe more than some can budget, but at 320 pages with 679 photographs, 97 graphics and 2 four-view 1/35 scale drawings and with coverage from the earliest prototypes to the latest A6Ms + future modernization efforts as currently displayed by the Demonstratoren and the PSO/UrbOps, the new Tankograd book is a better value."
4,Not Black,I just ordered this item and received it and find it interesting that the frame is NOT BLACK. It is silver. I am a little disappointed since I wanted to put it in a room where I have tan cabinets and black hardware so the silver isn't my first choice but I think it would be more pain to return it rather than just keep it and see if I can live with it. I haven't started using it yet but thought it was important to share that information with anyone else trying to purchase this item.
3,Love one but not all,I really love the first track of this CD and was stunned by its ambient tones and feel. However the rest of the CD was a bit of a flop in my opinion.... nothing more needs be said.
3,I like it: Good for what it is.,"I was given this CD as a gift and I definitely enjoyed it. There's no ""ground-breaking"" music but it is nice for background music. The musicianship is very good and there is a nice variety of styles. I like it better than what I've heard of Nancy Rumbel's work with others.At times it is relaxing, at other times, uplifting. As is the case with much of what is called New Age, it's a bit full of itself as to its importance.Don't let that scare you off. At least preview the music. It is is done well."
5,A wonderful gift book,"So many friends and relatives have gravitated to this book (which is always on the coffee table in my home) that I'm going to buy several copies and tuck them away for holiday gifts. We're planning to have a vacation house within the next few years, but this book seems to appeal to just about everyone because it's fun and relaxing to look at and all the places have decorating ideas that work in any home. A good friend borrowed the book for a few days and used one home as a guide to creating a ""nautical"" scheme, including using a boat paddle as a curtain rod, which one of the waterfront homes in the book shows. Thanks to this book and ( ) great prices, I'm getting some holiday shopping done right now."
5,A gift for us,"This is a gift we bought ourselves. Just having this beautiful book on the coffee table makes me feel that we're that much closer to our dream. Next year, we WILL have a second home. We have decided that we won't wait any longer. (Did 9/11 have something to do with that?) I came across this book, and I couldn't believe it because it was just what we wanted and needed. We love the houses and all the different locations, we're getting lots of ideas for what to look for in a location, and the book is a pleasure to look at. A wonderful package. I may even get an extra copy as a Christmas gift for friends who have talked about wanting to find a second home too."
1,For interiors (furniture) Not Interiors (space),"This book is a decent resource for a person furnishing their first or second home, but it's not a good manual for creating your second home. The photograph angles capture walls, windows, and furnishings, but fail to show the quality of the living space. There are very few exterior photographs and many of them appear to be from the 3/4 angle. There are no floor plans or building details. If you're looking for interior decorating ideas, this is a decent reference. If you're looking for creative planning ideas for building your first or second home, you'll want a more comprehensive reference."
5,soul satisfying,"I looked forward to receiving this book and knew it would be a soul-satisfying experience. I was struck by two things that set this book apart from others like it. One is the delightful way it lays before the reader the myriad options out there in terms of setting, activities, architecture, and so on. The photos do a great job of bringing all that to life and getting the reader to try it all on for size. The other thing that makes this book extra special is the personal touch of the author. The introduction is heartwarming. It's clear that the entire book was put together lovingly by someone who knows the subject intimately. Thanks for providing me with such a wonderful antidote to a bad case of late-winter cabin fever."
1,"Simple, Ordinary Decorating","The homes and interiors all look ordinary, in simple, few decorations. I didn't get any interesting new ideas from most of these photos. I mainly saw different building styles and wood colors. At least 50% of them look just like first homes, I just couldn't tell any difference."
4,Always Something to Learn,"I have a lot of Wing Chun and TCMA books and videos and I would rate this above average. I am closing in on my third decade of practicing Wing Chun, and my second of teaching. Although Tei Sifu is stylistically different from my sifu, he still has some interesting takes on drills and applications that I was able to adapt to my teachings."
3,The genius of JLP with a fair band performance.,"I'm a huge JLP fan since I was 15, when I first met his music with the LIVE album now released on CD. I gave the DVD 3 stars cause the show at that live album and of many more live albuns and presentations here in Brazil are far better than this one.There was so fantastic presentations with great drums, guitar, keyboard and bass musicians with amazing solos that the show at this DVD just look like a free sample of that anthologic ones. He performs just fine like he always do, but just listen to the Ralph Armstrong's bass solos, the Ray Griffin's drums solos and the Scott Hendersons guitar solos and you will find the real JLP deal. I'm still expecting a great JLP (band) live presentation on DVD besides this one is very good."
1,One of the worst books I ever read,"I am not sure how this book managed to get published. It is badly written, boring and nonsensical. The author, I am guessing must be over 60 as she refers to being educated in the 1960s, gives us a rather old-fashioned way of ""making friends."" The lifesyle of ""ladies who do lunch"" has long gone. She even talks about having a ""salon"" where people come and mingle. This book is ideal if you are a female over 60 who lives in a very large city who has more money than sense, needs never to work, has too much time on their hands and uselessly fills it by gathering strangers in a ""salon"" and feeding them - this is what she calls ""the art of making friends."""
5,Paradox,Musical taste is so personal. I like this New-Age stuff and Davol is very good at it. If you like easy listening New Age music you will like this album.
5,Awesome,"I tend to agree with the other reviewer thant this set is great. The performances are good (as always better ones could be bought seperately but that will take a lot of time and money) and the design is great!The only problem with this box and all the others that feature vocal music is that they don't have the librettos printed. Some of them you could find on the web but some are a real challenge to find (eg. Va, dal furor portata. I could not find the libretto of this piece from Vol. 12 of CME. ) The librettos of the operas are not hard to find but I would like to have them printed and supplied with the CDs."
2,Clinical Examination: A Systematic Guide to Physical Diagnosis,"The book i have read before.the condition of the book was poor !it is a (poorly)maintained book from a public library that has been re-sold with stamp marks blacked out. Poor cover, poor spine and marked pages. Not what i expected from the rating or the price. Not happy Amazon.com - not a good deal at all ;("
2,Disappointing Book -- Tintoretto Deserves Better,"Nichols' Tintoretto has the makings of a great work. The text presents a wealth of insights into this underappreciated painter. The biggest drawback is the book's small illustrations. Aside from the reproductions of several portraits (i.e. Portrait of Procurator Antonio Cappello, Portrait of Procurator Jacopo Soranzo) and a handful of other works (i.e. St Louis, St George, and the Princess), the plates are disappointingly small. This is particularly problematic because Tintoretto's works in the Scuola Grande di San Rocco were painted on a large scale. It is impossible to appreciate Tintoretto's technique or the details in larger works because the reproductions are so small. Tintoretto deserves better. Unfortunately, this is one of only a handful of available works on the great Venetian master."
5,A fine pick for any aspiring artist who would go pro,"Now in a newly expanded and updated fourth edition, The Business of Being an Artist provides a fine instruction manual on the 'art' of business survival, expanding on Daniel Grant's classic reference for developing a career as a successful artist. New sections on how to market and sell art in a weak economy supplement tips on marketing online, creating a website and blog, and more. A fine pick for any aspiring artist who would go pro, this is filled with art-specific business practices."
3,interesting,This is an ok boook for artists. Not as good as other books I have read. A book for the beginner in the Art world.catherine www.catherinefoster.com
2,Extremely Simplistic...boring,"I am very disappointed in this book. The quality of the designs & line-art is child-level, the paper is not sturdy enough to paint on , almost all the designs were so simplistic as to have nothing to color; for example, many have just 2 blank sections sections only such as yin/yang.IMHO, skip this book & get ""Power Mandalas"" instead--its pages are suitable for painting, framing, repeating without boredom & contain a wide variety of complex designs, meditation and color tips, etc.Gina"
2,This Old One Still Lingers,"As an old gasser myself, I was immediately drawn to this book. With the notable exception of Scrooge, there's just not a lot of fiction out there centering around cranky curmudgeons. So imagine my delight when this Vantage title graced my doorstep!And then. . .disappointment. Tedious writing, uneven plot development, glaring editorial glitches: the gaseous bane of subsidy publishing! At least I liked the chapter titles, all named after baseball innings, and I'll give the author two stars for trying to spin a romantic comedy about a corporate accountant and his attractive, ambitious coworker--a story that ultimately turned out to be neither romantic nor funny. I did, however, manage to finish this book in the bathroom.--D. Mikels"
1,Too late,Arrived well after when needed for patient -- company blamed UPS when questioned. Will donate to Soroptomists for their equipment closet to recoop my loss.
4,Words of Wisdom throughout history.,"A delightful collection of witty, humorous, and insightful quips, quotes and notes about writing, writers, publishers and editors. It's content is timeless, though some of the references date it. Nicely illustrated with classical clipart."
3,I've seen better..,"The lip ink hypershine lip gloss does create a very pleasant sheen to the lips, almost glassy, however, it requires more re-applications than I care to apply. The stain that came as a complementary gift, however, is wonderful, as long as you're conscious of applying it evenly. I'd recommend it. You might like it more than I did! :)"
4,Good Start For A Great Artist!,"This is a good cd to listen to for relaxing, yet it won't put you to sleep. Steve has a talent for writing pretty melodies. ""Victory"" is a simple yet pleasing song; he developed a more lenghthy and viverant version of it for his 'Bolder Boulder' cd. My favorite tracks are ""Victory, Seperate Ways, Begining Again, Change Of Seasons, In Another Time"". The only track I don't care for ""Journey Through The Night""; yet, it features sounds of a train using instruments; which is a creative touch. Piano, flute, drums, chimes, are featured on the cd. Indeed, Steve's music is relaxing, melodic, warming, refreshing, and cheerful, not spacy or weird."
4,Pretty Good,"This book by Bill Hybels does an excellent job of inspiring people to become volunteers and encouraging leaders to ask people to volunteer. This work also encourages leaders to support and encourage volunteers. This book is packed with one testimony after another of people who committed themselves to the work of the Church and found fulfillment. The chapters are short and this is an easy read. The testimonies are inspiring. The weakness of the book for me was that there was not enough ""how to"" information. There was some at the end, but any discussions about what kind of volunteer programs are best in church and which are not are missing. This is a good book in that it is inspiring, but I wish that it had been a little more pragmatic."
3,"Good Idea, Bad Execution","The subtitle of The Volunteer Revolution is ""Unleashing the Power of Everybody."" When I picked up the book, I thought it would be chock full of suggestions for pastors about how to lead a volunteer revolution at their churches. But this book is long on inspiration and short on information. What this book did very well was cast vision for leading a church of energized volunteers. It communicated the importance of mobilizing people to meet needs. What the book did not do well-in my opinion, anyway-was to show how to make the vision a reality. There are suggestions scattered throughout the book, but what I need is a plan. So,thanks, Bill, for showing me why the volunteer revolution is necessary. But next time, please write a book with step-by-step guidance."
3,Worth the price - I got it for free,"I received this book as a gift when it first came out. While the book gave a lot of inspirational messages, I thought it read like a commercial for how great Willow Creek is and that a lot of the examples didn't seem to apply for non-Willow Creekers. Most of the book seemed to focus on the inspirational aspect, but by the end of the book you are left without a concrete example of how to do it, or how to even start to do it.The book wasn't that long and I think Bill Hybels could have added a little more on how Willow Creek accomplished a volunteer revolution. Was it by requiring volunteer hours from members (which is an ongoing requirement of membership at the church)? Seriously, how many churches have armies of volunteers? What would your church look like with an army of volunteers?"
3,"Good product, but sized small","Not that I have a big head (!), but these are sized smaller than others for some reason."
5,Under a War-Torn Sky,"Wow! What a page turner! From the start, I was pulled in and felt like I was right alongside Henry, feeling what he was feeling. Henry was a ""boy"" who was a fighter pilot that was shot down during World War II behind enemy lines. Due to his perseverence and with the help of many strangers(including French Resistance fighters)who risk their lives, Henry makes it back to his family's farm in Virginia--as a man. This war story includes everything that anyone would want-danger, suspense, adventure, even romance! Don't miss it!"
4,very good but I think ''All Quiet On The Western Front'' blows it away,"This is a very good book about a 19 year old bomber pilot named Henry Forester. He is shot down and some of his crew is killed. What I like about the book is that it is very suspenseful and historically accurate. Some people say that it shows what war is like. NOT TRUE, L.M Elliot didn't ever experience war, she got it all from her fathers stories. There is another book called 'All Quiet On The Western Front' by Erich Maria Remarque that completely blows this away in terms of how realistic it is. Remarque was a German soldier in the trenches during WW1. His book shows how war really is. However, his book isn't a teen novel its adult. But I am 14 and was able to understand it. This book is very good but it doesn't show what it is really like in a war. Before someone says that I don't know what I'm talking about, read ''All Quiet On The Western Front""."
5,The Best Book EVER!!!,"This is the best Book i have ever read!! I couldnt put it down and i HATE reading! It is very exciting and suspensful. You may think it is on war so a girl wouldnt like it, but i think that is wrong i think any one would like this book. By far it is the best book i have ever read! So if you want a good book i recommedn this one."
5,History as a Story,"Under a War Torn Sky deserves a place on the bookshelves of all history lovers. Always historically viable but never dry, the plot follows a young American pilot, Henry Forester, whose plane has fallen under Nazi gunfire. With nothing but his wits and the derring-do of the French Resistance workers aiding him, Henry must find a way to return to the United States. His journey takes many unusual turns; to hide from the Nazi officers who haunt every town he visits, Henry must assume many roles, ranging from that of a long-lost relative to the chauffeur of a wealthy French woman. L.M. Elliott tells her story with sincerity, compassion, and a careful attention to detail that places readers in the middle of war-torn France. I highly recommend this book to every fan of historical fiction and to readers looking for a new genre."
5,A Great War Story,"""Under A War-Torn Sky"" was great. A great page-turner, and very suspenseful. It's a good read, and the author has done a great job of drawing a picture in people's minds of life during World War 2. A book for all kids and teenagers."
4,Under A War Torn Sky,"The book UNDER A WAR TORN SKY is a good book for children (around middle school age) who like war stories. It's a book written by L.M. Elliott. Henry (The main character) is a pilot for one of the B-24's from the United States Navy air force in WorldWar II. When the Germans shot down his plane, he has to trust people he doesn't know.When the Germans find him, will the German commander's hungry dog tear up Henry?Or will Henry be a friend to the dog? If you want to know I would suggest you read it."
5,If the title doesn't get u then the book Definately will!,"This is by far one of the best books I have ever read! Her descriptive words bring every part of the book to life, to the point where these characters are no longer fictional, but they become a part of you. I thouroughly enjoyed this book, it doesnt take long to read and to tell the truth I wanted it to last longer! It is based on the true accounts of WWII, and the trials our men went through. This book grabs you with its emotion, and factuality. Extremely well written. It is definately a book that a non-reader would fall in love with instantly. Not a second dull, and keeps you turning the pages. The chapters end, leave a suspenceful pull for you to continuously start the next chapter. A must read for readers young and old! You should check it out and see for yourself what I am talking about, the love, the faith in people, and learning of how precious each and every day is. An eye oppening novel that never stops amazing."
5,Under a War Torn Sky,"This fictional book is about a 19-year-old American bomber pilot serving during World War II. He is shot down over Nazis occupied France. He escaped only by the help of a league of curious characters who were part of the French Resistance. I loved this book it really touched me by showing the struggles that were faced in Europe during the war, and of the personal struggle that everyday people went though to be free. The book also used historically accurate information on the portal of the people that were part of the French Resistance. I hope that I have helped you to see my view on this book, but remember that they are only my views, so check this book out and see for your grab your self the book Under a War Torn Sky, by L. Elliot."
5,THE ULTIMATE IS RIGHT!!!,"When I purchased the 1998 version, I found that I skipped through most of the center tracks. From start to finish on this one, though, every track is a winner!Unfortunately for me, LA's dance music station was pulled from the air (a moment of silence for GROOVE RADIO, please...............). This 17 song disc is like the best of Groove. In fact, the song selection is so great they should put out a 1999 1/2 CD."
1,Overlook this one!,This CD features songs beaten to a pulp - you may listen to this disc twice after buying it. Maybe you are buying it for one or two tracks only! Forget it - get something different.
2,"Except for some exceptions, this CD bites.","Most of their songs have been overplayed on the radio until the station's cd copy disintigrated, but there are some exceptions.Monica's First Night Remix is the best I've heard in a LONG time. I just wish that version was included in the single. Oh well."
3,Decent brass hammer,"Brass Hammer 16 ounceAs of this writing, Amazon sells this hammer under three listings, as though it's a different product; by Northern Tool and Equipment, Boston Industrial, and BT. The only apparent difference between the hammers is the handle color. I ordered the one from Boston Industrial because of the black rubber handle shown in their ad. Unfortunately, they sent the one pictured under BT's listing, which has a red handle and yellow shaft (click on Customer Images).Quality of this imported (China) hammer is actually quite good. The all brass head is securely attached to the handle, the fiberglass handle seems strong, and the rubber grip is OK. The only quality issue is that I had to scrape away a sharp ridge on the handle where the mold halves join.I gave it three stars because of the handle ridge, and because Boston Industrial didn't send the one pictured in their ad. No one wants a ""different"" product than the one they ordered."
5,GREAT Kundalini yoga DVD,"""The Awakening"" instructs you in a vigorous yet relaxed workout in Kundalini Yoga. Kundalini has sometimes been called Yoga of the spine"" and for me, this has certainly been true. Kundalini has improved my flexibility, posture, and as a bonus, my breathing. This DVD in particular has helped me keep up my practice when I was not able to study with a teacher.The teacher on this DVD has a lovely, soothing manner, and her instructions are easy to understand and to follow. The music is very inspirational, too.I highly recommend ""The Awakening"" for anyone beginning the study of Kundalini yoga, and for those people already versed in the practice."
5,We don't need the Titanic to enjoy the Gaelic Storm,"The entertaining immigrant band ""steerage band"", or in most circles known as ""Gaelic Storm"", appeared in the award-winning film ""Titanic""...can only say they were a big hit in the film, but this latest release ""Tree"" from Higher Octave, shows many sides of this talented group of musicians.This West-Coast group made up of Shep Lonsdale(djembe/doumbek/surda/percussion), Patrick Murphy(harmonica/accordion/vocal), Steve Wehmeyer(bodhran), Samantha Hunt(fiddle) and Steve Twigger(bouzouki/guitars/mandolin), give out with blends of Celtic shading each lyric with International flavor, this is part of their charm.A stand out has to be ""BEFORE THE NIGHT IS OVER"", can hear everyone joining in with voices loud and clear, this would be a great sing-a-long, very catchy...the entire CD is an ""A Plus"", need more of the same...looking forward to their next project ~ GAELIC STORM!Total Time: 59:41 on 14 Tracks ~ EMD/Higher Octave OMCD-10247 ~ (2001)"
3,"OK, But Not Super Like Their Others","This CD continues Gaelic Storm's move away from the more traditional sounds heard on their first two releases. With each successive CD, they sound less raw and energetic and more Studio-ized. While I would highly recommend ""Gaelic Storm"" and ""Herding Cats"", ""Tree"" is a little bit tame and world-beat for my taste. It didn't help to look on the back of the CD and see that Rod Stewart had produced it; that guy drives me nuts. If you like Gaelic Storm's previous work, give this one a listen before you buy it."
3,This album has nothing you would want to see.,"If you want good music check out the previous 2 albums. I have no idea what happened but with the exception of tracks 1, 3, 14, and 5 this is utterly worthless."
2,If you think the title is dumb,"I'm having a real hard time with the title of this CD. One, two, tree? It doesn't say much for the musicians.I bought this CD after I met some of the band members at a pub in Northampton, MA. I have to say, it does nothing for me. There's a lot of fun, good, passionate Irish music out there, but you won't find it on this CD.Is that a real Irish accent put on by the singer? It sounds made up."
4,Gaelic Storm plus Kathleen Keane,"This new Gaelic Storm cd has many songs on it that are just as great as the first two cd's, including many that they play in their concerts like the favorite ""Black is the Color."" If you are already a huge fan of the Storm, you'll probably love this cd too. However, if you have not heard their music yet get one of the first cd's before this one. The major downfall of this cd is three tracks that are ENTIRELY Kathleen Keane playing, which as you might know, is also the most boring parts of their concerts. In two tracks she is singing, in one other she is playing various instruments. However, I still think it's a good cd, I just would not rate it as high as the first two."
5,To the contrary! This is a keeper!,"I was fortunate enough to be at the House of Blues to see the band debut this album. Believe me, they've lost none of the fire that their fans love them for. This is the most schizophrenic band on the planet--and I mean that as the highest COMPLIMENT. In person they are a kick*** bar band, but when you listen to their CDs, you realize what FINE musicians they all are too. Much of this material has been written by the band--it shows real growth as artists & people. The more I listen to this CD, the better I like it. Thank Gaelic Storm for having the courage to GROW!"
1,I have to agree with Mr San Fran down there...,"What happened, indeed.The only other Makers' album I have is Hunger, which kicks butt.I saw Strange Parade in the used bin today and thought ""A new Makers CD. Cool!"". I put it on when I got home and, after about five songs, had to take it off. Just plain bad."
3,WWE X-Rules,"Although I do like the quality of the matches,the event still failed to live up to it's name mainly because WWE's no blood rule,it's ban on chairshots to the head and it's PG rating.Not to metion the event's lack of weapon useage.The best matches on the card were the Swagger-Orton,the Cena-Batista and especially the Rey-Punk match eventhough Punk won and I would have loved to see his hair get shaved.The worst match was the ""Extreme"" makeover match.The rest are O.K. I give this PPV a 5 out of 10."
5,Wonderful,"A truly great addition to all my other holiday music. Be sure to skip the Donald Duck song... a waste. Otherwise it is a well-recorded beauty. The ""Respighi: Ancient Aires and Dances"" track is so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes. This is a very fine disc."
2,The Donald Duck Imitation Just Doesn't Do It...........,"The Donald Duck imitation takes quite a bit away from this otherwise great cd. Without it, I would rate this a 4 star disc. The song just seems so out of place. I'm listening to great music performed by talented musicians, and then I hear a Disney character singing on one of the tracks? Not for me....."
3,Place to start for SAT but not great for GRE,"The words are very basic even for the SAT. Words included are things like ""sever"" and ""enhance"". I am studying for the GRE and am finding the Barron's GRE prep book much better for the vocabulary work.The technique of giving a brief description and sample sentence is good but can be found in other places as well.The other good point is the words are not in alphabetically order so you don't end up just learning words that start with ""A"" but never get to ""V""."
2,There must be a better vocab book for standardized tests out there.,"I was immediately disappointed when I opened this book. Each page has 4 or fewer vocabulary words on it. The publisher could have used some of the empty space to put pronunciations of the words. Sure, just the word and definition is all that's needed to learn the word for a test, but I can't incorporate the word into my general vocabulary if I'm unsure how to pronounce it.Also, some of the words have other uncommon words in the definition. Not putting the definition in simple English makes it difficult to get a grasp on the meaning. On the opposite token, I would expect there to be many words that I recognize in the book. That is unavoidable. Yet some of the words are so commonplace I cannot imagine anyone about to take one of these tests that wouldn't know their general meaning. Some examples are the words ""stereotype,"" ""component,"" ""dimension"" and ""renegade."" These are just a few of dozens."
3,Verbal and Vocabulary Builder,"It is a good book for someone who has an average vocabulary and would like to improve upon it. If you are looking to improve upon an already extensive vocabulary, this book would not be of much help. This is the reason for the rating that I gave this book-simply average."
2,Moderate,"This book was good, however in terms of improving my score on the GRE it really didn't help at all. It is difficult to study something like vocab anyway, so I wouldn't waste too much money on books like this to do so."
5,"Powerful, Moving, Stirring, Haunting",This is the most powerful and moving Native American/Contemporary blend CDs I have listened to yet. It is far better than Cusco's light and airy Apurimac III. It touchs your inner emotions. It is one of my favorite CDs.
5,Gather round the fire now!,"Hard to believe this is the product of some folks from Austria..in fact, this could well be the last item from them as I understand, as the main brain behind this is now dead :( Really though, this is a wonderful statement of combining Plains Indian music and chants with some more western interpretation. I assume that a lot of it is authentic field recordings, complete with the crackle of flames and popping of coals in the fire and a huge thunderstorm that you better watch out for, as it will about blow yer speakers right out of the cabinet when it Kabooms!! Beautiful images of Indian civilisation are present in the soundscape, you feel like you were there for an hour or so. A really lovely armchair trip to the past, not in the same league as say R. Carlos Nakai, but very, very satisfying."
3,interesting sounds,this album is full of interesting sounds but I missed some special ideas in melodies...
3,Memorable music deteriorates into annoying sound effects,"This CD fares better than ""Sacred Spirt"" in attaining a blend of Native American chants with contemporary music. While the early tracks are excellent, the synthesis is not sustained over the entire CD. Sound effects of an entirely too crackling fire and later a extremely harsh whistle from a winter wind signal the deterioration."
5,Urban Folksongs,"This CD by Ellis Paul and very good, just like all of his music and his unique voice make it very good."
3,Good book but not my favorite,"I just finished this book and I am torn about what I feel about it. On the one hand, I really loved the characters and the character development. On the other hand, I felt it was a bit depressing and melodramatic. Especially when it had to do with Kate. I felt the descriptions of her ailments were a bit much. I would recommend this with hesitation."
2,Plods along,"This book does not live up to others written by Faith Sullivan. The story plods along with much repetition as the story moves from viewpoint to viewpoint. I finished reading this short book, but much determination was required!"
4,Luminous and Lyrical,"This is the first book by Faith Sullivan that I have read, but I will definitely read her previous works. Set in 1952, this story about three distantly related women of three generations was beautifully written. Althought it is ultimately about loss- the loss of parents, the loss of a farm, the loss of a husband and youth, it is well worth reading because it speaks so eloquently to the common feelings women bear and share. I loved this book. I'll definitely recommend it to friends."
3,Decent book,"I found this to be a decent book but nothing over the top. The best chapter is the second, which deals with buffer overflows. The rest of the chapters are quiet basic intros to networking and crypto. If you are completely new to the security scene, this is a great book to start with."
3,So basic,"Book just describes some basic ""hacking"" techniques. So basic it hurts.Every developer should know this basic tech.SQL injection in web pages? Jou must be joking. Buffer overrun? Ever tried that on an unknown app?Easy reading, but better spend time leaning assembler. I will find out more about hacking.It is not that easy anymore in 2010."
3,"not bad, but...","I like the idea of the book. But it gives only an overwiew or better an introduction into some hacking techniques. There is far more to tell about buffer overflows, for example. I fully agree that its contents isn't very new and that most papers are a little bit overloaded with printscreens or other stuff like that. But if you can live with them, it is not that bad."
3,Good book for basic concepts,"The Book give a good explanation of the concepts, however, the book kind of fail on the illustrations and samples base on general knowdleged"
3,A fine example of descritive writing.,"This narrative story of an English working class teenager is set in the late 1940's/early 50's and is reminiscent of Salinger's ""The Catcher in the Rye"". Sillitoe combines several themes in one short story,which can be read within 2-3 hours:a gifted youth struggling against social disadvantage,an insight into the reasons for the rise of socialism in post-war Britian and most impressively,a wonderful evocation of what it means to run,alone and across country."
1,Review from Holland,"Hi, I'm from holland, and I think that this book is very boring, That because we listened to a cassette and that was very monotonous. I was almost going to sleep under the story, I think it is the worst book I have ever seen.Thaty's my opinion about it, so you have to do with it whatever you want.I wish you all a good 2004 and a further live.Domin"
2,Interesting...,"Alan's Sillitoe's novella, ""The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner"", features a teenager who is able to express himself and find freedom in the isolated activity of running, with the theme being honesty and staying true to one's self."
4,The Loneliness of the Long- Distance Runner,"It was a bit difficult for me to understand the book bacause English is not my native language, but I think the book will be really great if you understand this kind of low-class colloquial English. It is very philosophical and makes you think about the moral question of what is right or wrong and also about honesty and cheating. The race that Smith loses on purpose at the end is very interesting, I always thought he would change his mind and win the race, when he was thinking about his father's death and the possibility to have a wife and children and a ""honest"" work. Sometimes I wished he would change his mind because he is an intelligent guy but most of time I think it's good that he goes his own way and doesn't do what other people want him to do."
5,I really like Mary-kate and Ashleys new video!!!!,"I think mary-kate and Ashley are two very intresting people ,they may look the same but their really not!I have seen all of their videos but my favorite is ""BILLBOARD DAD""!!! P.S I love your guyses fan club!!!"
5,This is an OUTSTANDING book!,"This book strikes an amazing balance between humor(it is incredibly funny)and uncomfortable truth. Example: On page 267, the author and her mother are talking about those two trapped whales from 10 years ago--""'Hanala, look at dis! To save two vales, da whole world comes. But to save six million Jews, nobody came.' I put down my danish. 'Sure Ma. The world likes whales.'"" That is a truly sad but incredibly insightful comment. I think the author has a fantastic sense of humor, and I think she should have her own national TV show; I know I'd watch!"
5,A must read,"I had heard some of the hype regarding the book, then was fortunate enough to meet the author at a holiday party that we both attended as guests. After talking to the author I was more determined to purchase the book when it was released. I'm glad I did. Although I did have a little bit of trouble with the format of the book at the beginning, once I got into it, there was no putting it down. It is full of so many different emotions. While reading one chapter I would be in tears and in the next laughing hysterically. Knowing it is a true story makes it all better. Some of the material is disturbing (at least to me), but it's life. I've recommended the book to friends and family."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.,"Stadner's book is well written and fun. She tells her stories in writing even better than she delivers them in person, and this book is loaded with all kinds of memories, each one tugging at a different heart string. She hits home over and over, and that familiarity makes it even more entertaining. At times, I found myself agreeing with her out loud, or calling my sister to remind her of something I hadn't thought of in years. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed every minute of it."
3,Fair,"I received the book quickly and it was in good condition but the book is strange and very long, but I'm getting through it."
2,Classics but not good ones,"Bought his for my collection of early classics but was disappointed with acting, direction, and special effects even for its time."
3,"Ice,Ice Baby","The Kalevala is the Finnish national epic. JRR Tolkien enjoyed reading it- indeed,it inspired ""The Lord of the Rings."" Little did he know, but the Kalevala also inspired the cheesy Soviet-Finnish epic ""The Day the Earth Froze.""In ""The Day the Earth Froze"",an evil witch (her look clearly inspired that of the wicked queen in ""Willow"") wants the all-powerful Sampo (""ask for it by name!"" to quote the great Joel Hodgson) The Sampo is a magical machine of sorts that makes gold, flour, and salt. There are some hilarious struggles between her and the good guys. Of course,the leading man has the requisite B movie Prince Valiant 'do. As for the earth freezing, it doesn't happen until the last 20 minutes. If you want iced earth, watch ""Day after tomorrow"" instead. In ""Day the Earth Froze"", good triumphs over evil playing easy listening music.""The Day the Earth Froze"" is hilariously bad. Mystery Science Theater 3000 skewered it wonderfully. They grilled it--making it good viewing on a cold night!"
2,Sword and Sandal flicks,Poor quality special effects and wooden acting.Not much better than an amateurish school pantomine.Possibly due to dubbing.
1,Situated Learning,This book is a must read for anyone wishing to understand the complexities of learning within contexts. You will find the author's explore many areas that people are involved in acting in and account for how they learn to function in these groups.
3,Interesting Concept,"This was an interesting concept for a movie ""Then They Came For Me"" which is still very relevant in this day and age. What I didn't care for in the movie was the very inconsistant audio quality. I found myself either turning up the volume or turning it down. This is still very relevant, but the look of it is very dated. Wouldn't mind seeing an up to date version of this reflecting on how Germany is doing now in 2012 vs. the 1990's.Till glad I viewed the movie."
1,Emo or Emu or whatever---it's now purged from my collection,"I think this ""music"" falls into the genre called Emo or Emu or whatever---it's now purged from my collection, regardless. Looks like I'm not alone in jettisoning this one---more than 5 dozen folks here on Amazon are trying to banish their copies as well.I gave ""There Is No Beginning to the Story"" more than a fair chance by suffering through it several times. It's as though bleating about one's inability to take charge or follow a course has now become fallow material for song-smithing, but this sort of meandering ""woe-is-me"" musing has been done before.The music and the words sort of mesh, not necessarily a good thing. Well, because we are free men, we do not have to listen to this sort of stuff, now do we? And who thought the so-called bonus track was worth sticking on here. Talk about self-indulgent gibberish.I need some Ray Wylie Hubbard blasting through the floor standers, shake some walls, and drive this drivel from my mind."
4,Good introduction to CF,"I picked up this book for a class project in ColdFusion. It served as a really good introduction - I read through it in a couple of hours. Good book for readability, I wouldn't recommend it if you need a reference book.Doesn't have all the features of the latest ColdFusion MX release but has all the essentials for a simple CF project."
5,Excellent.,A must have for your resource library.Great for the first time Cold Fusion User and an excellent tool for the advanced users to have in their resource library.
4,Important book on identity and morality,"Little to add beyond what has already been written by others. The writing is dense, as is common in the analytic tradition of Anglophone philosophy of the past century (almost). But this is an important book.Interesting note: I bought my copy in 1987 for $13.95. The edition being sold now is EXACTLY the same. No change, no updates, no additions. Same size, same everything. But now the list price is $50 and Amazon's price is $27 -- what a sad commentary on book publishing."
3,uneven is vexiing,"Service and packaging from provider were excellent. Quality was amiss in that when trying to sit said plates on a flat dining surface, evidence of uneve3n finishing on bottom is produced. Not too happy with that, joseph abboud."
3,Baby didn't seem to care much,"I thought the ball looks fun, but my baby didn't think so. Didn't get a lot use out of it."
1,Not lightly scented,"I purchased this product in hopes of finding a ""lightly scented"" natural soap. When I opened the box I was completely overwhelmed by the almond scent. I am afraid to even try it because it smells so strong!"
1,Don't Care For,I was looking up all natural soap and i came across this soap. It was cheap and seemed legit when it came to being all natural. At first i wasn't going to buy it because i could not find the ingredients to this soap. So i thought maybe if i buy it then it should have the ingredients on the soap somewhere or with the pack of soap......Nope! So really i have no clue whats really in this soap so i'm not using it. I threw mine out. Waste of money for me.
1,Terrible.,No wonder the author got this book out so soon after Enron's fall. He filled the book with the work of others and then threw in old essays on the failures of capitalism that have no connection to the Enron scandal. Don' waste your money on this book.
4,Pretty good DVD,"Well, this DVD was pretty sweet, except there wasnt as much dribbling as i would like to see...tho the dunks more than made up for it, and i'd liek to know if anyone knows who was the rapper that rapped 'la di da di, we liek to party...' during the section when they showed all the girls butts, thanks"
4,Dis DVD iz so so def,"40 minutes in total, 20 minutes of bs, 20 minutes of sick moves n' plays. Ball above all, sick dvd or vhs for ya'll. Skip to my lou feature is just trash, while the steve francis feature deserved my cash. Ballaz from around the way, with a section on white boys who can play. Future of flight feature iz so so def, James White's windmills, through the legs and free throw line dunks left me trying to catch my breath. If you put ball above all den dis be the dvd or vhs for ya'll."
3,Ball Above All,"This could have been a great video except for the fact that it was a short video. some of the spectacular plays were shown over and over again. Replaying the same plays just made the tape seem longer than it was. I have to admit though, there are some eye-popping plays on the tape(especially by Stevie Franchise), but if you want to buy this tape don't expect too much since it doesn't live up to it's expectations."
2,Amateur production with too much advertising for a DVD,"What could have been an awesome video turned out to be more of just a one-hour advertisement for hoopstv.com. The production is quite amateur and could have probably been done by anyone with a nice PC, digital camera, and access to some good hoop games. The action to talking ratio is 50/50 which just seems like too much talking and not enough ballin'. Borrow it from a friend and practice the cool moves. I haven't seen them, but from what I've heard, the AND1 video sound a bit more promising."
1,CAUTION: SUPER LAME,"LAME with a capital ""L""! To everybody that is a serious baller, don't even touch this video. You will find no pleasure at all from this DVD! LAME!"
5,You'll Be Breathless After Seeing This!,"This is a real ""dark horse"" video. I purchased it on a whim and now watch it over and over. The Steve Francis segment should be in Springfield Mass. at the Basketball Hall of Fame. This is right up there with two other great sports videos bought on Amazon, ""48 Championship Basketball Drills"" and ""The 59 Minute Baseball Practice"". Being a basketball & baseball coach it was a pleasure to watch a video and not have to jot down notes. Just enjoy and keep your remote handy with the rewind button ready to go."
1,WHAT A RIP!!!!!!!,"oh my god i want my money back......... i used to go on hoopstv.com all the time.. it was the dopest basketball site on the net.. and they started hypein there video sayin oh this is the greatest video ever blah, blah, blah... guess what i bought into the hype and but this peice of crap..... it is lame as hell..... half the video is celebrities sayin ""your watchin ball above all""... i know Coolio I bought the damn video.... there are two good parts in the film..... a small segment on the greatest Rafe""skip to my lou"" and there where no highlights of his magic but it was still cool that they was givin him love.... the second good part is at the end with 'Future' gettin buck wild on the court after he ripped apart the D and thats what i was expectin from the whole video.... anyways the whole video was a bunch of highscool dunk highlights and other stupid stuff and i repeat do not by this video..... go out and buy the And 1 Mix tapes or something else instead...."
5,Two of the Best Game Boy Advanced Games,"The Game Boy Advanced Castlevania games are some of the best in the series. With two games on a single cartrdige, this is a steal. They've perfected the 2d portable adventure game. Leveling, items, maps, magic, and action. What more could you want?"
4,It was really worth a purchase,"I never played a castlevania game in my life. But when I completed Dawn of Sarrow on DS, I started to look for another castlevania game before playing Portrait of Ruin. Aria of Sarrow was one of the finest castlevania games."
3,Castlevania Doublepack,"This game is too hard for Mom but the Husband and kids hooked it up through the gamecube adapter and they love it .I can't get past level 1 so its very chalenging.It.s about vampires and people with swords and stuff I am stuck atthe candle part and yeah I have gone on the top of the screen.Oh well not all is lost as other family members will get use of this.I on the other hand will stick to Donkey Kong,Horses 1&2,Cats 2,Hamsterz Life,Cakemania 1&2,and Diner dash,oh and Under the Knife I can do those and maybe the new MArio Bros. is more my speed"
3,Looks good enough for the front hall--but tippy,"Our front closet is so loaded with our own coats that, when we have lots of company, we have to empty our coats on the bed or take our guest coats to a bedroom. So we found this solution, and it works well (sort of). It required some assembly, but nothing tricky (just some time). It fits in with our traditional decor, and there is plenty of space to hang coats and scarves and hats. But it's a good thing I took aircraft loadmaster training several years back, since I am always having to rebalance the thing around its ever-shifting center of gravity to make sure it doesn't tip over. Still, it's much easier than hauling coats up and down the stairs."
2,Too expensive for the short content,"The DVD is too short. The techniques are not shown in a didactical, instructive manner. They are shown in order to impress, in a dim lit room with silver nunchaks. Also, I do not consider the double nunchaku techniques to be that advanced. There is an interesting material in the DVD, but I think that overall it has low quality/price ratio. It seems that the price is relatively high because of the computer graphics between the demonstrations."
2,not what you're looking for,"for those searching for enlightenment or a good piece of original composition on traditional instruments, look elsewhere! Sadly I must state this was a good idea gone wrong. The music quickly changed from what sounded like a good thing into noise and piano-ish sounds. Not what I was after! I find this happens so often with ""native"" sounds, whether it be North Americal, australian aboriginal, celtic, etc. You're probably looking for something more along the line of Nawang Khechog's work - a real ex-buddist monk. Skip this and move on."
2,Not What You Expect...,"Nothing like his previous ""Quiet Heart / Spirit Wind"" CD Set, which I loved. A letdown, and only 47 minutes - I'm glad. I'll go back to enjoying his previous effort - I'm listening to ""Spirit Wind"" as I write this! Calming."
1,About as close to Tao as Yanni,"More pleasant sounds than music, just one more disc of junk in the never-ending stream of new age, anyone-can-make-a-few-noises-and-call-it-music avalanche. Save your money, go for nice walk."
4,An excellent childrens story of faith and courage,And excellent little book about several children whose parents become Anabaptists. The book is written from the perspective of the childen. And has a fabulous story line. It is good reading if you want your children to have a deeper faith in God.
3,Great Book. Out of Date.,"This is a useful book. It would be an extremely useful book if it were more up to date. It was published in 1996. Given how fast this industry appears to be changing, much of the most useful info (publisher's data, agent data, etc.) is suspect. For instance, there is an imprint discussed in the book which no longer exists. There is a note on the copyright page which reads ""Attention Booksellers: This directory is published every two years by F&W Publications. Return deadline for this edition is December 31, 1998."" I really wish they had kept that up. There would be a 4th edition by now. That said, it still contains much useful info about the publishing industry in general and the insiders view from editors is great. Writer's Digest puts out good reference books. I would likely not have bought it, however, had I noted the pub. date initially."
4,Great summary! Lots of information in this book.,"This is a great book. It covers Primary Short Fiction Markets, Other Short Fiction Markets, Primary Novel Markets, Other Markets, and Agent Listings. Each Market contains what categories they specialize in. Lists on how to contact, when the publication was established, size of circulation, frequency of publication, payment rates are also included.. Even includes pictures of some of the editors. A note of warning: it is three years old and some of the information is out of date. Some markets have been added and some dropped since publication date. It is still a great reference for the writer."
3,Marvel Legends Legendary Riders Figure: Wonder-Man...,"i like wonderman, im not really a fan of this toy.I picked it up for my son, but as a collector its okay."
4,Looks good but could have been better thought out.,"I've been waiting for a Wonder-Man figure for awhile. I have one based on the short lived Avengers cartoon but while fairly cool it does look quite different from all of the comic book versions.Anyway, on to the figure at hand. The figure itself looks pretty good but I thought the choice of his vehicle was a little odd. If he had to have a vehicle to ride on I would have thought it should be more like the sky cycles that were used in some issues of the West Coast Avengers.The Yellowjacket figure is a nice inclusion. Unfortunately mine is defective. I can plug him into the back of the WM figure but only upside down."
3,A matter of taste?,"It is something unpleasant about the sound here; it is resonant, yes, but not like the Takacs quartet. Comparing to the Takacs' take on op.76/1, 2 & 3, which I love, the Angeles' makes me think of a grey substance, sterile, antiseptic, of no life. Is it the sound quality? Or is it the way the quartet is playing? I think the latter, but it is difficult to figure out what is wrong; in fact I don't find any serious miscalculations. The problem is that the playing feels calculated; it is some kind of contrived perfection, it all feels too concious; I feel something wrong about the accent, the stress of the phrasings... but I give up: Suffice it to say that I regret I bought this collection of boring performances. Three stars for professional playing. If you like some human touch, go for the Aeolian quartet, less perfection, more life."
1,Poor stereo mastering on this set,"This recording is marred by poor stereo imaging. The left channel is consistently weak, with the result that the players are heard to be spatially to the right of center. This is an embarrassment to Philips and Polygram. They should remaster the set properly and offer replacement sets to those who made the substantial investments."
4,Informative,This book was written very well and I beg to differ with the people who didn't like it. It was very informative when tying in the ghost stories which I like. Although the first part was a little boring and didn't hold my interest real well. It is a book that I think people should read if they like history and ghost stories combined.
5,The Haunting of the Presidents: A Paranormal History of the U.S. Presidency,Great book! Interesting read. All of the previous stories I have heard about paranormal events relating to US Presidents PLUS new information is located in one convenient volume.
5,Jock Jams4 special review,"I think this is a great cd. For people who are into this type of music. I think it was probably the best Jock Jams CD yet. If you like Jock Jams or Jock Rock or slam Jams you'll definately love this CD. Some cool songs: were in my opinion: Gettin' Jiggy With it, Backstreet's back, space jam,unlimited megajam, though most of the songs were great."
1,DON'T buy for Space Jam,"I bought the Space Jam track because it was the only place I could find Space Jam and not some s****y cover. It ends in the middle of a phrase and the instrumentation sounds really shallow. It was only $0.89 so it's not a huge loss, but for the best movie ever, this is a pretty disappointing showing."
2,Not as good as 1-2-3,"This CD came out too quickly, they didn't let enough good songs get on it. Instead, it is filled with too much cheerleading, a mix that just contains too many songs, too much Dickie V., and oh baby, too much Austion P! Most of the songs on this are songs that weren't good enough for previous Jock Jams, this is a collection of wannabes."
3,"Its ok, but not the gratest","I've first bought this when i was 14yrs old. you know back when this cd was hot, but 10 yrs. later, its not all that, i have better stuff to listen to."
4,This one gets your body movin'!,"This cd kicks butt. It has a lot of high energy sound and it is mixed with some good slower sounds like Mo' Money Mo' Problems. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is that I never thought that Chumbawumba's song would be considered a jock jam. Same with the Backstreet Boys; their music is weak. All in all, it is still a groovin' cd."
2,Had to Put it Down,"It's rare when I don't read a book straight through but I had to let this one go. I found the writing stilted (especially the dialogue) with too much exposition. A lot more heavy lifting is required to move this plot forward, especially with the ambitious number of characters involved. Barely two hundred (widely spaced) pages wasn't enough to develop the story line or the characters."
1,"Disappointing. Poor quality Image, poor for price","For the price $16.99, it was disappointing. The tape was almost unviewable. On one VCR, it wouldn't track, on the other, poor quality image. Tape jacket says Cha Cha & Salsa, but contents was actually Rumba & Cha Cha. 5 routines each dance, and I would say intermediate level."
3,It was just okay,I guess I was expecting more but it was something that I wouldn't read again and that is how I know if I like something. I kept waiting for something to click and it never did.
4,Tell me no lies,Liked the book. A lot like lowell's other titles. You just need to remember written in another time.before cell phone time
4,Wonderful book,I would definitely recommend this; slow starting and must pay attention or one can get lost. But Lowell is a great writer
3,"I loved this book the first time I read it in print, but ebook has a few mistakes","This is one of my favorite Elizabeth Lowell books, and with so many hard to find in print I decided to buy the ebook version. The story is as great as I remember, but there were a few spots I really had trouble reading because of missing print or mixed up print. Otherwise I still love this book!"
5,Loved this story,"Having read a ton of Elizabeth Lowell novels, this was one of her best. I thought Lindsay and Catlin had hot, explosive chemistry together. The background information on Chinese bronzes was just enough to interest you. Sometimes, Ms. Lowell goes a little overboard with info in other books. The tension as Lindsay fell deeper into the seedy world of forgery and stolen art and international politics was so high that you could personally feel her pain and wondered if she would ever be the same. Great ending!!! Overall: A."
5,Excellent.,"This is my all time favourite Elizabeth Lowell book. it's such an interesting story about a Chinese woman and her skill in identify antique jade artifacts, and the ties that bind you to a family. Elizabeth Lowell tells the story of Chinese Jade in great depth, and it's really interesting to read. In amongst that it's a fabulous love story. Top Read."
3,An Okay Storry but...,"Tell Me No Lies by Elizabeth Lowell is an okay story but I did not like the borderline race implications. Don't get me wrong I love this author and most of her novels, just not this one that much."
1,What An Awful Book - Unreadable,"This book was recommended to me by my librarian, whose taste I've trusted up until now. This book was unreadable, and in point of fact I didn't finish it. This is apparently part of a new sub-genre; the bodice-ripper-thriller. Over 100 pages in and still nothing has happened. All we know is how attractive the two protagonists are. Yuck. This is the literary equivalent of a chick flick. If it hadn't been a library book I would have chopped it up and buried it in my garden for fertilizer.I am not a misogynist; there are many female authors that I read, enjoy, and esteem: J.A. Jance, Sara Paretsky, Faye Kellerman, and Janet Evanovich to name a few. But I think Ms. Lowell should stick to books with illustrations of Fabio on the cover."
5,"Steamy, Sexy, and a Plot!","I only wish all of E.L.'s books were this good. (I've only read a few.) It's rare in a romance novel to find realistic, well developed characters, an interesting and well researched plot, AND incredible sexual tension that keeps going until the end. Two thumbs up!"
3,Last Word Game,We love to play games in my home and this one sounded like fun. It's ok but I wouldn't reccomend it for avid game players. We played it once and no one really wants to play it again.
3,Just okay,"We played this game with a large group of people, including adults and children. While the idea of the game sounds like fun, it quickly became a shouting match with 12 people shouting out answers at one time. It was impossible to keep track of what everybody said, so people were repeating each other's answers which led to some arguments. For the sake of family peace, we had to switch to another game.I do think this game would have been more fun if we had less people playing, or perhaps a group that did not include as many children."
4,Good for some fun and laughs,"I got this game as a Christmas present from a friend. I've played it a couple of times. The one thing some people complained about is that anyone can put a subject card and start the timer. So I changed the rules where every player puts their subject card down in turn. That seemed to make the game work a little better. We still keep the rule where a player can change a subject card if they don't like it. Once the subject and letter are announced, the timer starts. Players call out answers till the buzzer sounds. The person giving the last accceptable answer gets to move ahead on the board.The timer definitely keeps everyone on their toes. Overall, a fun party game that makes you think."
3,It's okay,"It's not a very creative game. I think you could create it on your own. We love games, but got bored with this one."
2,What's with all the hype?,I ordered this game based on the reviews and was disappointed. My family played it one night and switched back to Balderdash! Now THAT'S a game! Wouldn't recommend this one.
5,It's About Time,It's about time for a greatest hits cd. I haven't bought it yet but I'm sure it is 5 stars. I love their songs.Update: Bought the album and I love it!
2,Average at Best,the Group had talent&also Keith Sweat gave them a good launch but on a whole they were always a 2nd tier Jodecci to Me.they had a few cuts that were alright but they never showed me much Musically growth&when you talk about Greatest Hits you gotta show more overall.vocals were cool&they were better early on than there later stuff to me.
2,Sesame street has better activites than this program,"I wouldn't recommend this program, there are better activities on the sesame street website. Not worth your money..."
5,Elmo's Great!,I bought this for my 3-year old son and he loves it! He actually found the other games and demos on the CD himself. I can't keep him off my computer. This CD is great!
1,"Too Small, Too Clumsy","This ice crusher has got to be a joke. The tiny cup that receives the crushed ice constantly slips out of position, sendiing crushed ice everywhere. The entire contraption is very small and clumsy to operate. This product is a total waste of money."
4,Can't stop crushing ice!,"Not unlike a previous reviewer, I was also smashing ice in a ziplock with a hammer. This is definately a step up in the world.I have yet to smash my knuckles because of the poorly designed handle- but others are right, there could be greater clearance for the crank. Also, it is a manuak ice crusher, so you've got to use quite a bit of force to get the job done. One negative, the nut popped off once when I got a little overzealous is turning the crank the opposite direction. The nut is supposed to come off for cleaning purposes, and since I tightened it, it hasn't come off again.I am addicted to chewing ice and this does make the perfect sized ice bits for chomping.I haven't had any problems getting the ice out of the cup and the stainless steel components are nice: easy to clean and sturdy. The unit looks good, too.Expect to deal with the manual operation, but overall this is a great little tool for the kitchen or bar. I love mine!"
4,This is a neat little retro gadget,"This is one of the gadgets from the past that should be in every home. Crushed ice makes drinks colder. This ice crusher works without wearing out the blender. It also makes a nicely sized chunk, rather that the slush made by a blender. The only problem is that it periodically jams. I would recommend this item."
4,A very fine piece of equipment for your bar,"I love this ice crusher. It works well and although I agree that it can be hard to operate, it yields fantastic results, beautiful ice chunks that are perfect to quickly cool down any drink, and ideal to prepare drinks in a shaker, where you are looking for maximum surface of contact from your ice.It will fit more than 2 ice cubes as claimed by other reviewers, I always get at least 4 in (regular cubes). Note that it is not required to close the lid completely before starting to crush. Once you've started turning, try to keep a good momentum and you will have you ice crushed in 5-7 seconds."
4,Very good for a manual device,"Bought this product for my wife (was on her wish list). The unit looks much better than shown in the photos. As for crushing ice, it does a fine job. Yes, it takes effort and some strength (you will, after all, be crushing ice manually), but the result is very nicely crushed ice. I've been able to load five large ice cubes into the bin. The cover does not immediately close with this much ice, but, while holding the cover down and with a slight turn of the crank, it will fully close. Only two complaints. First, the difference between fine and course ice is not discernable to me. Second, the unit could use a larger, heavier base for stability. Otherwise, I enjoy using my wife's(!) Ice-O-Mat."
3,Sword and Sandal flicks,Fair quality considering the age of these films.The usual sword and sandal antics.Certainly not the best of this genre but nevertheless quite enjoyable.The second film is slightly more enjoyable although not set in the mythological age.
2,Itty Bitty Hick With an Itty Bitty (You Fill in the Blank),"Alan Jackson represents the very best in snipped singers with no talent. This is moron country at its worst. Listen to songs like ""Itty Bitty,"" and you think you've reached the nadir of how low country has sunk?No! Then he comes back with such lyrics as....""That's my houseThat's my carThat's my dogIn my backyard.""Pure genius! Why listen to garbage like Willie, Waylon and Johnny when you've got this second coming of Hank. :p"
5,extraordinary contrast and clarity,"I replaced a very good Princeton 19"" lcd monitor with this one (20"" 204T) for the additional resolution but got an unexpected bonus in the visual range displayed. I have been used to large (20-21"" crt displays - NEC) which are great for photography work but lousy on desk space... I have not viewed this 204T next to a crt but I will not be surprised if I find them comparable. Well done Samsung !"
2,Good but not great in the long run,"I have owned this monitor for 4 years. It worked fine until recently, but now I have a problem with the monitor flickering. After hunting on the web I found that this was a common fault with the 204T. Due to faulty electrolytic capacitors - there is a fix that is easily found by searching on Google - but it does involve dis-assembling the monitor and removing the faulty capacitors and replacing them. It's not difficult, but not for the inexperienced either. I think next time I will go with a manufacturer that doesn't use the cheapest components they can find."
2,Not Awesome...,"Ordered on 12/3. Arrived 2 weeks later. Ok, that was bad, but the product came used, tangled, and full of leaves. Not new!?!? Its already too late to send back,since the kids wanted to decorate the house to make sure Santa doesn't miss it. Wont be using these guys next year. Enjoy the coal in your stockings."
4,The firebird takes flight again,"This volume of Phoenix is made up of two stories.""Yamato"" is a great story about finding immortality though what we leave behind, not by trying to live forever. This was one of the most touching of the stories.Unlike ""Yamato"", which takes place in the past, ""Space"" takes place in the future. This story is not as touching as ""Yamato"", but the storytelling is amazing, the panel-to-panel transitions blew my mind. I have read a lot of Tezuka, and every time I think I have seen the peak his genius, I find some thing like this story telling. Unfortunately I felt let down by the ending."
2,I Didn't like this book,"This book was about two young children in the quest of finding a young prince. I think that there was too much characters in the book and I personally think it wasn't as good as the rest of the collection. And if you want to understand well what role every character plays, you have to read the whole collection of the Chronicles of Narnia."
5,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS. I GIVE IT ALL THUMBS UP!!,"I think The Silver Chair has a little mystery in it. I like the characters Jill, Scrubb and Puddleglum.. I have only read the first four stories of the series. So far my this is my favorite one. Many of my friends have read this series and said it is their favorite one. I totally agree. C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors. I would suggest this series to people who like fantasy and intriguing stories."
5,This book is full of adventure and edge-of-your-seat supense,"Through reading this book, I have found myself plunging headlong into a world of fantasy and wonder. C.S. Lewis' unique way of twisting and turning the plot has made me expect the unexpected and chalenged me to reach new heights in reading. I have found myself joining in Jill, Eustace, and Puddleglum's hopes and struggles to find the long-lost Prince Caspian. This book's detial and realistickness makes one think that they are realy right beside the heroes and heroinnes all the while. By Taylor Boston age:10 years"
4,Expect the Unexpected,"Jill, an ordinary school girl, can not stand being picked on. Then her friend Eustace tells her of a magical place called Narnia and how he wished he could be there... Jill and Eustace are planning thier trip to Narnia when the bullies come to fetch them. In a desperate attempt to flee Jill and Eustace find themselves in a place they thought they would never be, Narnia.But in a silly boast on the edge of a cliff, Jill makes Eustace fall.Then she comes face to face with a talking lion! How will she get out of this mess? What became of Eustace?I liked Aslan's steps and ideas. The fauns and centaurs are cool two! The scenery is deseptive and the places are beautiful.The actual prince Rilian and how he came into the story was pure brilliance. The great snow dance and it's rythm was graceful.I didn't like the children's arrogance. They were too arrogant about beds to trust Aslan. In turn they had a whole lot harder time trying to follow the remaining signs."
4,Another Wonderful Story,The Silver Chair continues the traditions of the other Narnia Books. The children are the heros. The villians are vile. The ending is happy. And there is a moral to the story. I love it and so do my Grandchildren.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"None of the original group of children are in this book, rather you get the annoying cousin, and one of the girls he goes to school with.Most people's reaction to school bullying is not to get help from a supernatural big cat, but there you go.Once in Narnia, they end up on a quest to find a prince, the offspring of the now aged Caspian."
1,ARRIVED DAMAGED,"Arrived in a timely matter, however book was damaged. The last few pages of the book were missing. It appears as though those pages had been torn away."
4,The Silver Chair,"The Silver Chair is one of the best books in the Chronicle series. If you love adventure, fun and worry, you'll love this book.I loved the dialogue alot. It has a good amount. You might need an adult to help you with the big words, but it still is a great book. I read it for school. My mom and I loved it. I liked the movie a little bit better. Sometimes C.S.Lewis uses too much description in his writing. You will probably not want to read it again, because there wouldn't be much suspense. This is the sixth book in the Chronicle series. Do not read it first, you will be confused.It has some cool characters, Jill, Eustace and Puddlegum.(He is my favorite.)He is always bringing them down in a funny way. They come in to Narnia to find the lost prince. It is a great story."
3,More fun to listen to than to read,"Had trouble opening the audio file. The path to the file seems a bit complicated.Didn't have any such problems with any of the other 4 audio CD books I have purchased from Amazon.In any case, the technical problem was overcome with the help of my son-in-law without too much difficulty, and I have been enjoying the 'performance' quite a lot.There are probably many books that are more fun listened to than read."
5,An Amazing Story!,"No one can capture the heart of children and adults alike quite the way C.S. Lewis did with the Chronicles of Narnia. The movies that have been are great, no doubt, but nothing compares to the actual books. The Silver Chair was actually the first Narnia book I ever read and I loved it so much that I went hunting for the others (to them all in order). Who doesn't like stories of heroes, and of enchantments, and of good vs. evil, and of death defying escapes?"
3,"Good, but a low point in the series.","I re-read this along with the rest of the series after having read them several times as a kid. They're definitely for kids, but still fun to read as an adult especially being able to remember reading them as a kid.Without any of the original characters from the first book, this one suffers. The plot also is not terribly exciting. The new characters introduced in this one aren't all that interesting. The marshwiggle is likeable and ok, but the giants, the earthmen, and the new witch aren't terribly compelling. The Prince also isn't as impressive as the Narnian royalty from other books. Having said all that, it's still a decent story, it just doesn't live up to some of the other books in the series.If you're reading this series for the first time, be sure to read it in the correct order (starting with The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe) instead of the stupid order they are currently marketed in, as they will be much more enjoyable."
5,A Book to Savor,"Platero and I is not a book to read in one sitting. I read it slowly, each little story over and over. It's lovely images and haunting emotions stay with me for a long time. Wonderful!"
2,"Well, this was interesting","Im not really sure who the target audience was for this film. Gays? Well if having a gay guy sleep around and make out with every guy walking is what gays are into these days then sure. Females? Well this girl sleeps around (as most girls do) and gets pregnant, gils dont like seeing their life on TV so they wont like this. Guys? Way too manu guy on guy for straight men to enjoy this film. It had some funny moments and the lead acctress is beautiful, but I guess if you have nothing else to watvh this would be ok, but I'd browse around a little longer."
5,"Wonderfully written, compelling, great character development","We got this book at the library and loved it so much we have recommended it to all of our friends who read, and some who don't. The characters were so well developed you felt like you knew them. I was astonished that a man could write the strong, lead women characters so well. Great book"
4,One Heart Wild,"Danny Heines is in my opinion one of the best light jazz guitarist out there. His music allows you to paint a picture in your mind of something peaceful and beautiful. It's very relaxing way to calm down after a long hard day. Although I do like other types of music, like country, christian, classic and modern rock. This is surely an alturnative to the other."
4,Mmmmm....coffee.,"My Grandmother really enjoys her coffee. And she particularly likes this coffee. Once we purchased a k-cup brewing system and she saw how easy it was to use, the big item is to find a flavor/type that you enjoy. She's found it, but then finding a price she can tolerate was another issue. We found it here. Thanks for making my life easy!"
5,Smooth Morning Blend,Best cup of morning coffee; no bitterness and great flavor. Exceptional price for this amount of single serve. Highly recommend.
2,Still more to come after vol 8,"I bought this for 43.99 on Feb. 5 2013. I jumped with the price drop because i really wanted to get the artbox where if i waited for a used copy with a lower price it wouldnt be guaranteed. Its advertised as volumes 5-8 in a series artbox. NOT episodes 5-8.I got 4 episodes Thats it, 4 episodes. The original 1-4 volumes had 3-4 episodes PER VOLUME. and GET THIS according to the Hellsing wiki page there are 2 more episodes to come which makes this artbox useless as an enclosure for the complete series. Very disappointed I didnt learn all this before. Here is the link: [...]"
2,Not what it seems,"WARNING!!!!!! It is a box that has space for two dvd cases, with only one case and a cardboard space filler that tells you, and this is a direct written qoute, ""Replace this box with your copy of Hellsing Ultimate I-IV, *subscript: Availble online and in stores"". Which means that to not have empty space in this box you have to buy the combined collection of 1-4. I am extremely disappointed in this packaging. I honestly feel ripped off, and I can't even enjoy the OVA because of how angry I am. I purchased the limited editions of the first 4 episodes, and was expecting an art book or something with this, but no, its an empty box saying ""Replace"".I know its not about the packaging, its about the OVA, but I was expecting it to be something I could proudly put with the rest of my collection, and instead its...basically a half empty box with a normal plastic Blu-ray case."
5,Excellent Experience,Item as described. Shipped and arrived on time. One of my son's favorite Christmas gifts. Will be more than happy to shop with again.
4,"DVD case poor quality, and just...wow.","Was happy to receive this product since I loved the series! But...the DVD holding case came broken. Not to mention the holding case held the DVD case & a paper box where you're supposed to put the first half of the season (seperate order). Why they didn't just sell them together and call it good is beyond me.Now the other half...The jap audio is amazing, and gets you right into the series. Feels darker as well!English audio....I usually give dubs a chance but wow, this was hit and miss! Some roles were played perfectly and others just made me cry inside. Also they change a lot of the script, for the worse and give it a ""corny"" feel.Overall great series, and a must own for vampire/alucard fans! But terrible presentation with the packaging, and damaged DVD case on my end.5 stars for the series!3 stars for the overall faulty product."
5,Awesome!,Can't wait for the other volumes! Great stuff cannot get enough of it. Recomending this to everyone i know. Great stuff!
5,Fantastic,"If you even just liked the first 4 volumes, then you will love to see the next 4. The story gets even more intense, and, not to be a spoiler, Seras kicks ass."
5,At Last it's here!!!,"Ordered this last friday and it was so freaking good to watch this whole series all over again!The blu-ray is beautiful.Now, i just hope the conclusion of this series does'nt take another 3 yrs. to get released.Alucard is THE best!"
3,Quality of disk solid. Story is meh,"I received this set within two weeks. It played with high quality and no pirate bootleg to be seen.As for the story itself?I adored the first four and couldn't believe my luck at the price, but not only does the animation look different, but the tone of the series, the characterisation and voice actors are different. It had some awesome moments, though plot events and characterisation had me scratching my head at some points (it might be explained more in the manga; I'll never know). By the end I felt kind of dissapointed, but I'd get the newer installements to see what happens next.It's a pretty decent series and definately worth checking out."
4,Creative house music,"The trio is now a duo but the creativity has just lept on another level with this second album. Still features a lot of hot deep house grooves but with more research behind the music. More complex than 'Cafeteria' and thus less immediately grabbing. A wonderful listen for fans of Daft Punk, Rin√©rse, Chemical Brothers, Basement Jaxx or house music in general."
1,"This book is the exact same thing as ""Env Eng Solved Problems"" so do yourself a favor and buy it instead of this book.","This book is the exact same thing as ""Environmental Engineering Solved Problems"" only it is older. Buy ""Env Eng Solved Problems"" by Schneiter, 2006, Professional Publications Inc, instead of wasting your money on this old edition with a different name. ISBN 978-1-59126-071-4."
3,DigiRoller Plus II,"We use these for work, and over the years have purchased about 20 of them. They work well and are accurate but they are not very durable. The handles are weak and always eventually break off. They used to come with a 2-foot circumference wheel, which was light and about 8-inches in diameter. They now come with a 1-meter wheel, which is about a foot in diameter, is heavier, and is less convenient for our purposes. Don't use the even larger 2-meter wheel; as the manual points out, it is too heavy for the handle. You also have to be carefull when changing the batteries; there are four AAA cells in the handle but only two are readily apparent when the cover is removed. You have to pull out a paper sleave to access the inside two."
3,Needs improvement,This should have been a 5 star product. It has the features I wanted but!! you must be careful not to roll it to fast or it will not accurately measure a distance. In the directions they tell you not to go over a certain speed but I do not get any where near that speed and it does not count accurately. The result is I must make several measurements of the same distance to insure it did not miss some counts. Another thing that is bothersome - it is not balanced. All the weight is on the side the handle attaches to. This means it is uncomfortable to use because your wrist is always in a slight strain to keep it from twisting away from the line of measurement. Other than that it is a nice machine
1,Major Disappointment,"Have had the unit for under a year and several problems have arisen. The back cap for the battery cracked and then finally broke off completely a few weeks later and now the screen will not work but the buttons will. Went to customer service to get a new battery cap ($5.00) and a screen but they will not just sell a screen unit, you have to send it in to be fixed ( around $70.00). Will not buy another one of these units, will try to fix myself or go back to a manual read unit."
3,Digi Roller,This is a great wheel. I reinforced the handle with a strip of aluminum because it is a weak point they need to fix. Other than that its great.
2,No longer believe,"After spending several years with the organization and being left in the dark on legitimacy and authenticity of the style lineage and history, I left. this book only works if you take the classes. Otherwise it is useless. On another note, it is filled with ideas and ideals that conflict with the teachings of the style's Shidsohi(modern Bujinkan term) and is laced with improper use of japanese terms and language although what they are trying to get across actually is in english for you to read. I have lost my faith in the system and its head but anyone planning to take this should inquire all the appropriate questions, who's your teacher, when did you start studying, where can I contact your teacher/master, may I see your certifications/credentials? If you can be supplied all these items by your teacher and his teacher etc etc... then give it a try. You have to decide for yourself if you think its a good system,... or a joke."
1,Is this a joke???,"Not only is the content laughable, the author seems to have no clue that Konigun is not a Japanese word, and neither is Seija (who he claims to be his ""master"") a real Japanese name. Furthermore, the title ""Konigun"" is written in Katakana on the cover. Had it been a legitimate Japanese Ninjutsu name, it would have been written in Kanji.As mentioned earlier, the techniques in the book are ineffective, and seem to be intended for the gulible high schoolers with too much time and money on their hands. Bryce Dallas is a total fraud. A google search with the name Bryce Dallas + Bullshido will reveal everything you need to know. A little bit or reading from Miek Skoss and any decent MA historian will disprove the rest of Dallas' b.s.Keep far away from this one if you value your time, money and intelligence."
3,"Better than average, but more average than good","Shidoshi Bryce Dallas undoubtedly has a lot of experience, which he transmits in this book. The text by itself, no doubt, is excellent, but the illustrations/pictures are simply lacking. There is no breakdown of techniques except in the first few pages. You must have previous experience of Ninjutsu to use this book, which is intented solely for the purpose of reference (which the author states in the first few pages). Do not buy this book unless you are very familiar with martial arts terminology, for even if there is a glossary in the end of the book, it refers mainly to things that aren't even in the book. Overall, I think that this book could have been made excellent if it had more illustrations, and if it an effort had been made to translate more japanese words."
4,Interesting mixture of fantasy and historical fact,"A friend recommended this book to me and I was glad she did.The focus was on female characters and heroines and I especiallyenjoyed the changes in time sequences. Mr. Reilly writes withthe authority of someone who has studied history and with theimagination of a very ""free thinker"". There were many surprisesin this book, but I won't give them away to any perspective readers. Suffice it to say that I'm now going to read his well-liked first novel ""Shenanigan"". All in all, ""Through a Dark Passage"" was an enjoyable read and a pleasurable experience."
4,Science Fiction and History with a lesson.,"A beutifully written eclectic tale that combines science fiction, history, and karma in a novel that can not be completely categorized. Reilly breaks away from the pack by telling a story of redemption of one man, as he perhaps reincarnates over time and distant places. This novel speaks about human nature in a way that captures your attention, intrigues your mind, and sometimes makes you laugh. The personality in its most base form, lives on to make amends for past deeds, while remaining true to their characteristics and talents. Reilly has hit a home run with his hard earned insight, a talent for thinking outside the box, and a writing style that leaves you wanting more, more, more."
1,will not do anything,i needed this for a newsletter for my job .i would not do anything . I tried to use it on about 6 different types of machines and it was useless . a waste of hard earned money
5,Wow!!!,"After messing around with two video cards from another Mfg (that I could not get to work, my Quick play arrived today and it is a Great little product. It's quality is better than expected and in combination with Avermedia's PCI 350 TV tuner, I have my own PVR at a fraction of PVR/TiVo prices.One word of caution, make sure your Display settings do not exceed the max. I made this mistake and took me a while to figure out why it was not working-Pilot error."
5,This does exactly what I need it to do,"This product is very easy to set up and does exactly what it should do. I have a brand new apple macbook pro and need to get video on to a standard television set. After I purchased the mini display to vga adapter from apple, I then needed a vga to standard composite video adapter. This one is perfect. Good quality at a reasonable price. No nee to spend hundreds of dollars on other converters. Until apple makes a direct adapter for their new macbooks, This is the one to get."
1,Disappointed,"POC! This product is a complete disappointment. It is made out of very cheap materials, the picture & text quality is almost unreadable, and I could not even get the video to work. Shame on you Avermedia for such a poor quality product. I returned mine after working with it for a few days."
1,Do not waste your money,I bought this so that I could use my brand new Sony Wega as a large monitor.Pictures and Video look fine. Text is unbearably hard to decipher.I went to AverMedia web site and found this FAQ when troubleshooting the image issue. ...Even they tell you that it is not going to be perfect.So unless you are going to use your PC as a DVD or Picture player don't waste your time and money.
5,Loved it...,I bought a whole bunch of Aurora plush toys for my nieces and they just loved it. These toys are very soft and kids just hang on to it forever...
5,Cute toy!,My 4 year old daughter loves this tiger and sleeps with her every night. She is really into tigers and loved getting this for Christmas. It is really soft and just the right size.
4,Righteous cool raunch without the dressing,"You've got to love this one. Most rock or metalheads had either vaguely heard of Danzig circa their 2nd album, but this one came through the pipes quite cleanly, and deservedly so. In a summer that was full of schlock, this was a diamond in the rough.When you've got a lead throat that blends Jim Morrison (unfortunately), Roy Orbison, and Ian Astbury, you can't really go wrong. And on the best tunes (Dirty Black Summer, Left Hand Black), the hardest metal tune you could ever think of suddenly slips your mind, and brings you back to the beach.This is one of those rare, elusive albums that is best played in a long convertible down a stretch of highway. Booming and at times (How the Gods Kill, Anything) too beautiful for words.When we needed to be rocked afresh, this was the album that came through in the nick of time. Thank God it's still here."
3,Sistinas is the good song...,"...on this record. Everything else is so-so. But Sistinas is amazing. It's a little touching moment with everyone's favorite weight-lifting ex-misfit freak. I tell my girl-friend if we ever got married and decided to have a serious wedding for the family and all that ""Sistinas"" would be the Danzig song we could get away with with out freaking anyone out. It's a beautiful spooky classic by Danzig. Well worth the price of admission. Seriously though."
1,Disappointing test prep,"Unlike the CAHSEE Math prep from the same publisher, this book contains no diagnostic pre-test to help the student determine which chapters to study."
1,Don't buy Napoli,"I can only echo what so many others have said-- the Napoli dishes chip even with the most careful handling. Additionally, the dinner plates are so large they do not fit into my cupboards or my microwave. A waste of money, and Pfalzgraf will not stand by its product. Several emails resulted in their best offer being half-price to buy replacement Napoli dishes-- and a warning that I should not used chipped pieces. I was a loyal Pfalzgraf customer before Napoli; now I will no longer buy this company's products."
4,Hidden treasure,"When I bought this c.d. several years ago, it immediatly became one of my favorite c.d.'s. I found out about Davol on a program called ""Currents"", and there was no question that I had some catching up to do, not only with this c.d. but with his two previous releases. One of my favorite tunes from Davol is on this c.d., called ""Gates of Ishtar"". It is just absolutely magical and inspiring. Davol covers musical territory that no one else has come close to matching."
2,buyer beware: anti-mite feature comes from embedded chemicals,"This is not my area of expertise, but the chemical which is used to give this fabric its anti-mite properties (didecyldimethylammonium chloride) is a suspected neurotoxin. While I'm sure the amount absorbed through skin contact is vanishingly small, its safety in a product like this hasn't been well studied, and this gives me pause."
2,Not as advertised,"Here's the bad thing about this product, it is advertised as a mattress ""PAD"". If you place your index finger together with your thumb you will see exactly how much of a pad this product is. I'm being serious. I was putting it on my mattress and my thumb went through it. The good.. It's a nice snug fit and it's advertised as ""anti dust mite"" who knows... I guess this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for. If you just want a simple barrier between the mattress and your sheets this product will do. I was expecting more, no, at least some padding."
5,A true gift for music,"I really can't express it any other way. The talents of Peter Kater and R. Carlos Nakai are really amazing. I have many CD's from Kater and Nakai, and this CD is one of the best. Its emotional involvement and passion are present when you totally involve yourself into the music. The range of musical instruments, and the fire of the Native American spirit make this a CD that will be greatly admired."
4,how the west was lost cd,How the west was lost.Great delivery and good quality cd.highly recomended.this is a fantastic cd for relaxation and quiet times.thank you kindly
5,A fine limited edition collection,"This is the first poetry collection by Robert Morgan (author of GAP CREEK) since his excellent 1991 book GREEN RIVER: NEW AND SELECTED POEMS. Printed in a limited edition of only 500 copies, WILD PEAVINES contains nineteen previously uncollected poems published in magazines from the early '80s through the early '90s. Like most of Morgan's work, these poems are set in the Blue Ridge Mountains. They deal with subjects such as Cherokee history (""Signal Fires""), the southern Appalachian landscape (""Wild Peavines""), the traditional culture developed by the white settlers (""Thrush Doctor""), and the poet's father's love of work (""Mowing""). Some (such as the already anthologized ""Honey"") also deal indirectly with the nature of language and poetry. It's a very fine little book, and beautifully designed as well."
2,"If you don't habla espanol, just keep walking","I am a huge fan of Carlos, and have been for years. Ever since the release of 'Take a Joke, America', I have eagerly awaited the next album. So, imagine my joy when I saw this album.I was disappointed.Usually, Carlos' comedy is peppered with bits of Spanish, mostly well-known words or stuff you can figure out. This album, I'd say about half of the album is in full Spanish. And it's mostly the punchlines to his jokes. He sets them up in English and then goes into Spanish, with no explanation.There's nothing on the CD to denote that large portions of the contents are in Spanish, so there was no warning of this. Not even so much as an SAP button.If you don't already have it, grab 'Take a Joke, America'. It's a great album from one of the funniest men of our time. But not this album."
1,Worst CD by Mencia,"This sounds like an attempt to gain the George Lopez audience. Hell some of the material sounds almost the same. Personally I know Mencia for his political stabs & off the wall comedy and this is just bland ""point out the Mexican stereotypes"" CD. Pass on it if you're not into this."
1,Expected more,"I read all the reviews before I purchased and I was so excited about this activity book. Do NOT waste your money.It's poorly illustrated and every ""activity"" in it unimpressive. Seriously Mom's, you can put together simple crosswords, drawings and ""activities"" just as well or MUcH better than what is in this book."
4,language and the brain,"Donald Loritz's book ""How the Brain evolved Language"" was an excellent review of language as it evolved from the beginning. It was technical but interesting and it was a great review of different language processes. I would recommend it to any professionals who work with clients wiht any type of language difficulties."
5,essential Carmen LIVE!,"at one with her trio, an inspired set, flawlessly recorded, Carmen is in top form and as present as ever. BUY IT!"
3,Not A Good Choice,My only complaint about this CBC-TV special package is that too many of the songs performed during the program are not complete versions of the songs. I'm glad I didn't purchase this during the PBS fund raising drive. I sure would have been pissed. The Running Thru Canada disc is a better choice.
1,a piece of trash,Dice is one of the worst so-called comidians ever.he is a Racist Scum bag.what a bad joke that he ever blew up?
3,Not the same Dice Man,"Great seller: ice man , well lets just say i should have left it as i remembered him.. not what i'm hearing now..."
3,Great Book for Beginner's to .Net and programming,"If you are new to programming, I would definitely recommend this book. I thought Chapters 1-9 were great and easy to understand. There were some errors in the later chapters in the practice code.If you are a programmer I would recommend picking something else..."
1,WORSED ALBUM EVER!!!,"THIS ALBUM IS WACK, THE REAL N.W.A. IS EAZY, CUBE, DRE, REN, AND DJ YELLA...NOT ONE CAN REPLACE THEM NOT SNOOP OR FAGGET ASS GAME. GAME IS WACK, HIZ FLOWZ ARE WACK, AND I DUNO WHY HE CALLEZ HIM SELF GAME BCUZ HE AINT GOT NONE. DONT BUY THIS ALBUM PEOPLE ITS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY. I ONLY GIVE THIS ALBUM A 1 SINCE ITS A CALI ALBUM GIVE IT LOVE BUT IT DOESNT DESERVE MORE THEN THAT."
1,who would of guessed,"g-unit was 3 for 3 befor Game. 50 cent, lloyd banks, and young buck all had great cd's but Game's cd is not good at all, it bad!!!! don't buy this cd don't even burn it from your friend! its not worth the 20 cent cd. good luck next time Game!!!!!! you'll need it ggggg g-unit LOL HE SUCKS"
4,sweet story,Touching story that engages the reader and partner in fun conversation that can build lasting routines for bedtime.

2,You get what you pay for,"Well this case serves its purpose well for the very light user, the case itself is sharp in appearance and fits the V710 well even with the extended battery and case cover. Unfortunately, I an not a light user, and access my phone often and am active while wearing it on my built. The belt clip lasted about 2 weeks for me, before the disk that is atached to the back of the phone used to clip into the built clip broke. I recomend getting the WIRELESS SOLUTIONS Premium flip style case with swivel belt clip, it costs twice as much but it won't break and if it does it has a lifetime waranty and can be replaced."
4,Fit E815 well,"I purchased this case for my E815. It fits very well. However, I don't like the clip, which makes the case bulky."
2,Way to expensive on amazon,You can get this cheaper anywhere even with shipping. Ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty.
1,SCAM,"I bought 5 bottles of oxi stain remover spray advertised to clean tough stains, however I was shipped EMPTY BOTTLES with no cleaner. Spent more than store price for convenience of delivery, boy what a mistake this was. Contacted seller for return and refund for this ridiculous transaction (who pays 50 for empty bottles)."
4,Insightful study of one of history's greatest generals,"While the text itself is somewhat dry and analytical, this rates as one of the great studies of military tactics and provides a facinating glimpse into the mind of one of history's great generals. Attacks! is Rommel's first person account of his experiences in WWI. As was his custom, he recorded his military exploits and summarized his findings for his own personal study and the benefit of those military students to follow. Anyone interested in gaining insight into Rommel himself or interested in what makes a great platoon/company level commander should read this book."
5,WW1 wasn't all trenches,"Rommel's WW1 memoir shows the Great War wasn't all trenches. It also shows why the Germans used so much infiltration in WW2 - Rommel did it in WW1 (the Germans tried infiltration in France too), and this book was very influential."
5,A Guy Called Dad,"""A Guy Called Dad: A Daughter's Journey"" is a intimate and revealing documentary that explores how mental health (schizophrenia) effects a father / daughter relationship. The complex array of affective, behavioral, cognitive and perceptual components makes even the simplest of tasks a real challenge.Producer/Director Kacey Arnold sheds light on the realities and complexities of mental illness with sensitivity and humor. This documentary is a ""must see"" for anyone who is impacted by a psychological or behavioral disorder. Stigma and discrimination add to the suffering associated with disorders. I feel that this film compliments the greater social movement towards increased awareness and acceptance. Well done."
1,worst gaspard ever,"I don't understand why she is famous. These two pieces are two of the greatest piano pieces ever written and I would even say that ""Gaspard"" is the greatest. This means that the pieces are so well written that they, for all practical purposes, play themselves. Until you play these pieces, you don't get the full sense of their greatness. I guarantee you, that Ms. Argerich has no idea what she is playing during ""Gaspard"", she sucks all of the life and sensuality out of it. Did she read the three poems that ""Gaspard"" was inspired by, which are printed on the first page of the Durand edition. Probably not. It is not that difficult. I will give her more credit for the Schumann, there is less opportunity to screw up.Bob, R, Seattle"
1,"If it doesn't work, take it back DAY 1","I bought the a320n on the last day of the year for my business. Good thing I had a weeks worth of vacation and some slack time because this lemon became my new hobby! I got it all booted up and yes, uninstalled all of the HP ""let's sell you something"" software. I then tried to install my new HP printer (4110). CRASH, CRASH, CRASH. After 14 hours on customer support (OK, I'm tenacious) to Nova Scotia and India, I received 8 different reasons this might be happening. The last one was what made me bring it back and swear off HP products. Customer support told me that I had getten a virus from my Internet use. Ya know those viruses are REALLY tricky when you can get them without ever being able to connect to the net. I can laugh now but beware. I am writing from my new emachine. Easy set up, so far so good and with luck, I'll never get to know tech support.One thing I can't get back is the tax break for '03."
4,"Good Deal, he says!!",I had taken this lens for my friend when I visited the US in 2004. He is a die hard photographer and makes good use of this very very very very big lens! And he seems to be very satified with this investment so far! Great results in the photos that he has taken with this lens! Also the price which had paid for this was almost a steal! :)
5,Just right,"Really clean, simple design and well constructed. And it's just the right size to hold what I need and not get lost in my bag."
5,Crash Proof,"If you are the least bit paranoid about something happening to your Flash Cards and the precious images you have on there, then this is the perfect carrying case. I took a couple of these down to central America because of my concern with the jungle humidty, rough handling and the possibility of getting submerged while traveling by boat. Fortunatly we didn't get the ""dunking test"" but all other concerns proved to be valid. These are cheap insurance and I won't travel without them now."
3,Not great,"Solaray is a good brand, but I did'nt notice that the quercetin helped my hay fever like the Olive Leaf does."
4,Can't Give It 5,"If you are a fan, you would buy anything Julia puts out, even if it were just her singing in the shower. So this, of course, is a must buy. But I can't give it 5 stars.The synthetic sound from the keyboards and drum machine brings the album down a grade. I don't know if Larry Klein's production is intended to be more interesting, commercial, hip, or just different... but it doesn't do her justice. It is like substituting imitation flavoring instead of pure in a potentially great batch of ice cream.If you have heard the buzz about Julia Fordham and are just checking her out for the first time, I would go to ""Porcelain"" or her ""Collection"" to sample her at her best. Then, when you are hooked, add this one to the collection."
5,So Glad I Found Her!,"I found Julia Fordham by accident. I was on the telephone, on hold for a long time with Sony tech support; you know, music in background to soothe you as you wait. This wonderful voice started singing and suddenly I no longer wanted tech support to pick up for fear they'd interrupt. I jotted down the phrase I kept hearing, ""Concrete Love"" and did a search on Amazon[com]. Luckily it was the album title as well! I am so happy I found this CD...I play it over and over. How could I have missed this wonderful voice until now??"
5,Julia Fordham-Concrete Love,"This woman's voice, words and overall consistency to create such inspiring music is incredible. What I regret is that very few people I know have heard of her and that is a shame. Julia's music relates to life and its changes. She is my favorite and always will be."
4,Cool Tunes For a Hot Summer!,"I heard about this disc via NPR, but I rember seeing the video for ""Happy Ever After"".This is a great disk for simply popping in on a hot summer day (a common problem this summer in South Central PA) and chilling out!But I'm sure this disk will get play once the weather cools off too.I recommend ""Italy"", and ""Something Right""."
5,Julia scores again...,"An outstanding effort, she's back in perfect form. The album is a classic ride, an intelligent effort by a gifted singer, songwriter who deserves much more attention then she has ever gotten. I believe this record is her best to date. The only thng better would be to see her live, she is not to be missed. Her humor onstage belies her dead serious takes on love and loss. A unique balance, and one I hope to see for a long time to come...Go Julia."
3,Second Time's the Charm,"It is an exact replacement for the battery in my Tracphone, which was still running on its original battery after several years.The bad news: the first battery shipped to me was dead as a doornail. I left it in the phone plugged in to charge overnight and got nothing.The good news: the shipper included a toll free number for service, and the service people were very helpful.I did have to go to the trouble of shipping the bad battery back to them, but they quickly sent me a second one which started charging immediately and is working fine."
4,Nokia BL-6C Battery,"After reading all the reviews, even though most are negative, I still bought the item thinking for such a low price it was worth the risk. I am completely satisfied with the product and the seller. Bought Bluetooth previously from them and i'm happy with their products."
1,Does not work,Used this product for over a year. It does not work at reducing under eye puffiness or dark circles. It made my dark circles look darker.
1,This isn't DesignCad it's the Tutorial,"If you're looking for Design Cad 2000, this isn't it. It's the tutorial ! This product has been advertised wrong in the catalog."
2,"Thin, not well organised.","As a civil war fought in quick campaigns, Hicks explains that far less documentation survives from the Wars of the Roses than from other period conflicts, such as the Hundred Years War. Even given this lack of historical information on the combatants, their numbers, their equipment, and the exact sites of the battles, Hicks's volume still feels thin. It's also poorly organised, out of chronological order. One chapter lists the outbreak for each of the three phases of the war, even though these phases were ten to fifteen years apart. Then a later chapter lists the other details of each campaign. Overall, it's far less complete a general reference than some of the other Osprey Essential Histories, such as Anne Curry's _The Hundred Years War_."
2,The Cliff Notes of military history,"The ""Essential Histories"" series from Osprey could easily be compared to the Cliff Notes series. They'll give you a nice introduction to a topic you are not familiar with, but no real depth. Most volumns are under 100 pages; therefore, don't expect many ""man in the trenches"" stories.This is one of the more difficult reads in this series. It does tend to jump around too much."
3,exciting story of the man who was poe,the book was tuff to follow it had so many twist and turns in the book.It was a good book and i like the way that avi wrote the book.It is a great book to read when you have extra time.If you like scary and twisted with a little bit of confusion.
3,the man who was poe review,"I think the man who was poe was ok. I think that it could have been more scary than it was.It would have been good if Throck went bad at the end and crashed the boat killing himself,badly injuring Edmund and Poe . Then Poe would have to save Edmund and help himself to shore.I also think there should be a sequel."
2,It was okay,This book was okay. There was parts that I absolutly hated and some that I liked. I would not recomend it to many people. if you like books that that you really don't understand this is a book for you! Also The ending is not that good!
5,"This is a wonderful, suspenseful book.","This was a simply wonderful book! It was wonderfully written, had good descriptions, and kept my interest. I couldn't put it down. It also informed me about the life of Edgar Allan Poe, and encouraged me to read Poe's works."
3,Poe Review,"I think The Man Who Was Poe was an excelent book for adults and Pre-Teens. When you are reading you don't want to put it down. As you are reading there are some spine chilling moments, but there is a mysteries around every corner. I don't really like scary books to tell you the truth, but this was spectactular! Every chapter you read there is at least a couple new mysteries. I addmit some of the people in the book are a bit odd, but they also would act very smart in some situations. Even though I said this book was great I would only give it 3 because sometimes the book gets a bit scary , and sometimes it was hard to keep track of what was going on. Other wise I would give it 5 stars. I would not reccomend it for little children one because it would be too hard for them to read and two because they might get frightened. And, that is what I think about The Man Who Was Poe By: Avi"
1,Inaccuracy Kills Book,"Pardon my diatribe, but this book is the worst historical fiction ever written. Anyone even vaguely familiar with Poe's life with be appalled at the grossly negligent treatment of him as a drunk without a single moral in his being. Avi can't ever seem to hold a thought together, and relies heavily on the descriptions of Poe, appearing every other page, emptying a bottle. ""Poe"" in this book should not be confused with the real Poe. And I suggest for better reading to check out something written BY Poe."
5,The Man Who Was Poe Review,"I think the ""The Man Who Was Poe"" was a great book. Infact it was one of the best book I've ever read! To me Avi is pretty smart to atempt to write the book like Edgar Allan Poe would have written it.One of the reasons i enjoyed this book so much was that it was mysterious and at times frightening. It sometimes gave me the chills!If you like books that freak you out and mess with your head, this is the book for you."
4,The Man Who Was Poe,"I really enjoyed this book! There was a lot of turning points, but made you think about what you just read. It made you go through all of the clues, and figure out the mystery yourself. This was the best mysery book I read!"
3,POE REVIEW,"The book, The Man who was Poe, in my opinion was a pretty good book with the style of edgar allen poe. The story is about a boy named Edmund in search of his family but meets a man, Poe. Avi did a exceptional job writing did this, adding many twists poesh words. I gave this book 3 stars because though it was good, the material was kind of complicating because they kept on introducing new characters and conflicts. But I still think it's a good story."
4,The Man Who Was Poe,"I thought this book was great! The only thing though, was that it a really depressing book. I liked that it was mysterious and it made you want to keep reading more.Throughout the whole book I was wondering where all of the people were, AVI just talked about the characters and that made it seem more depressing.I really liked this book, it makes me want to read more of AVI's books.I gave this book four stars, because it was a book that I couldn't put down, but it's probably a book that I wouldn't buy."
1,I'd Rather Eat Rusty Nails For Dinner Every Night For a Week,"I had to read this for a school book report. It was the worst. I wrote on my book report that I would prefer to eat rusty nails for dinner every night for a week rather than have to try to read and understand this strange, difficult book. I hated it!"
1,Poe,"This is the WORST book i read, i would advise you not to read it and just through it away, if you get it! (...)"
4,Slutton Rievew,"The book The Man who Was Poe, had a unique theme. It gave the reader an eiry feeling of helplessness, provoked by the idea of a youg boy(Edmond)eight years of age all by him self, without any one to protect or take care of him. It makes you want to read more just to make shure this child makes out all write.When Dupin comes on to the seen you find a story take on sucpence. As you hope for trust or freind ship in Dupin. Is this man going to help, or will this misterious drunkerd leave Edmond to fend for himself? He has an unacountable spiret of a wondering sole. On his very next binge his memory could be slerd, and drive demotivated, or will he just forget his perpose for helping this youg boy all together? Will they find his sister in time, or will this strang mans own demons of the past, come back to hunt him, and hindering his sole once again?!!!The story is great, with an ever biulding susspence, whichI have never experianced in any other book I have ever read."
4,It made a difference to have read about Poe himself.,"I think that this is a very good book. By reading his stories and poems I think that it would make a differnce for me to read about Poe himself.The way Avi wrote this book, it was like I was in that real situation in the story. The style of writing was very realistic. I would definitely recommend this book to a Poe fan."
5,The Man Who Was Poe,"The reason why I rated this book this way is because this is the kind of stuff I like to read. I like the books of suspenseful story of murder, dark deeds and diappearance. I don't usually read books, but when I was in 7th grade I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. Since 7th grade I have been doing this book, as a report for four years. The real reason why I read this is because I like to read Edger Allen Poe books. I told my teacher that I liked Edger Allen Poe and he suggested that I should read The Man Who Was Poe. Thats how I got started on this book. This book kept me in my seat every second."
4,Okay,Reading this book in English class last semester was great. Avi did a great job with showing what she thought of Edgar Allen Poe. The book is a real page turner. I was suprised at how it ended. The only problem I had was when it was revealed who kidnapped Sis and what happended to Auntie. It was a little confusing.Penny Lane
3,What I thought about The Man Who Was Poe,"...I read The Man Who Was Poe.This book was a mysterious book.It is all about solving problems of murder and mystery.I gave this book 3 stars,because I prefer action;adventure,or suspense books.This book was kind of suspensful,especially when I read it at night.Overall I thought this book was preety boring and dull.I guess this book was just not for me."
1,BORING,"I am sorry fo all the people who like this book, but I thought it was very boring and that's all I have to say sbout that. It needs more excitement."
1,This book wasted my time!!!!,"This book is one of the worst books I've ever read. I'm not a nutball who's just writing this to take up space. Trust me! The book is bad! It's boring and has a confusing plot! There are many different sub-plots witch never get solved! The basic storyline is a homeless boy who meets a man named Poe. Yes, that Poe. Poe is a drunken idiot who still manages to help the boy through life. Bo - ring! This book is a waste of time and also a waste of money. Do not order or buy this book. You will definatly be sorry."
4,4 When you're Hating the World,"It's raw, attack the audience, evil mischief. Delicious if you've just had enough of people, yuppies in particular....who wear sweaters. Just take a look at the picture of Clay on the cover. It somehow seems to explain what happened in this one here. Crude, Rude, very Angry. This is the opposite end of the spectrum from Cosby, Seinfeld, Blue Collar, etc."
3,Not That Great.,"I pretty much have all of Dice's albums, and this one happened to be on sale so I got it. I loved the Day the Laughter Died Part 1. That is a great album. It was in my opinion a genius comedy preformance. The humor was in him trying very hard to not be funny at all and being a character of himself, essentially giving people an exaggerated version of himself and kinda sending a message to them about how stupid they are for liking this idiocy.Dice tries it again on this album, but I felt it wasn't genius at all. It was just words. There was a couple things that made me laugh, but the whole preformance was just so-so. I would recommend this only to hard-core Dice fans."
1,The end is here...,"Dice never got any worse than this album, although I've yet to hear his latest. It's an attempt to follow up on his classic 'Day the Laughter Died' double LP, but it misses by far. Only a few good bits on the whole thing, and they're funny by accident. His timing's shot, his raunch is no longer subtle, and he wastes too much time on unfunny bits."
2,Dice's lowpoint,This album is almost sad rather than funny. The jokes are very recycled. The album has some very funny parts which make it a must for the completionists. Overall the jokes are weak yet the material is just as raunchy. The album ends with him getting into a heated argument with an audience member. Those are the last moments recorded from Dice. It's very mediocre.
1,Dice hits rock bottom on this!,"Just as I thought Dice was getting better ..."", he goes and releases this garbage?!I always thought Dice was funny, but his jokes about women could offend quite a few people. Regardless of that, ... so naturally I thought the sequel would be much better. WRONG!Dice does nothing but yell, insult the audience, repeat the same stupid stuff over and over, goes off completely over his trademark ""dirty nursery rhymes"", says some of the nastiest things to ever fly out of a human being's mouth, then, to top it off, throws the mike down and goes out in the audience to pick a fight with someone. (Personally I hope Dice got his ... kicked).The man's career seemed to go downhill from there, and it was after that that he decided to reinvent himself as a TV star ..., but he soon after retook the stage as the ""Diceman"" we all knew so well.All I have to say is, save your money on this album. It'll leave a bad taste in the mouths of even the most die hard Dice fan."
1,"If you have to buy this, at least get the others first!","This is by far the worst Andrew Dice Clay album I've heard. I've listened to Dice for twelve years, and I LOVE most of his stuff. But this one was horrible. Of the sixty-sum minutes, probably about 15 are even remotely funny. Mostly he just fights with members in the crowd. This isn't a bad Dice album, it's a bad album period! If you MUST own every Dice disc, make sure this is the last one you buy. Only tracks worth a listen are Gas, Deaf & Dumb, The Wedding, Pink Spot, Wife Tells All, Surprise, Chinese Restaurant, and Greeting Cards. The most worthless ones are The Argument, Mad Max, and The Contractor. Absolutely pointless."
3,I didnt know Jack,"I bought this CD without hearing anything on it. Based on the Poco connection and great reviews, I thought I couldnt go wrong. I could not get it out of my mind that I was NOT listening to Don Henley!!! There is not anything really wrong with it, but the voice and style is not my cup of tea. Bottom line, if you like Don Henley, buy it. Otherwise, forget it."
1,Well-dressed grizzly hunters,"This book is certainly NOT one you can't put down, in fact, you can hardly get through it! Is it the totally uninteresting characters? Is it the fact of a complete description of the dress of each character as a fashion statement supposed to enhance one's understanding of the character? It it the attempt to be a nature mystery when it feels more like a romance, or a trade magazine for the fashion industry? Is it the continuous descriptions of everything that leads nowhere? I am half-way through and considering giving it up as a lost cause for it to even get anywhere."
5,A good reference book for a forgotten war,"As the back cover suggests, the books in the Men-at-Arms series are not history books in the normal sense, but rather cover the uniforms, equipment and organization of various military forces of the past and present from around the world. In covering the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (or Abyssinia, as it was known until modern times) this book sheds light on the forces that fought this largely forgotten war.While not a history book per se, is most certainly a good addition for anyone studying the conflict -- where else will you find an illustration of the Camel-Mounted Artillery of the Italian colonial forces that fought in Somalia?"
2,Not the best guidebook for the area.,"This seemed to be a decent guide...and then after using it, it was found to be lacking. The routes are sometimes awkward, and missed better routes that are easier to trek, and thus safer. Some of the trails are either poorly noted, or have changed since publicaton in 2001.This is a guide that can be greatly improved upon.There are locals in the area who can give far more accurate directions, and better yet, guide you to the places safely, if you are not experienced at hiking this terrain. This optionis highly recommneded to photographers or those hiking with children/teens and weekend warriors/older folks.Kelsey's Canyon Guide is thought of more highly by those with both books."
2,Poor storytelling even poorer scholarship.,"We learn nothing new in this book (everything in this book is public record) nor do we get an interesting POV from the author. I hoped that at least the author would somehow have more info regarding clandestine operations/covert ops policy using NSC or personal the notes of the president's. But nope, just easily compiled research with weak supposition; makes me think if the publisher was duped by the author that the text would be either a comprehensive text or a critical study. Instead they received about 200 pages of recycled poo.Abridged literature review: The author wishes to convince the reader and the general public that the CIA acts only when the President orders it to do so; and intelligence work is becoming more and more politicized, which compromises integrity from the DCI, down."
2,Executive Secrets,I ordered this item over a month ago and have no confirmation of shipment to date. I am beginning to wonder if the item will ever arrive. I would not recommend this seller unless you do not care when your item arrives.
4,Good recording for serious musicians.,"This recording is Chung's first Vivaldi 4 Seasons recording.She looks beautiful, She sound beautiful, and she is still very passionate.But this recording is too hard to understand for non-musicians. She is performing it with a lot of thing in it but you can't notice it fast.To hear a refreshing and powerful Vivaldi, I would recommend Anne-Sophie Mutter's second recording with Trondheim."
2,Go elsewhere,"I am a great fan of Kyung Wha-Chung in things like the Beethoven or Brahms concertos, unfortunately her Vivaldi is as boring and old fashioned as I Musici's. Great things have happened in the last 40 years regarding baroque music. At this point it is quite simply impossible to ignore what Harnoncourt, Leonhardt, Gardiner and several others have found about period performance practice. If you want a lively, interesting and very well played Quattro Stagioni go for Fabio Biondi and L'Europa Galante in OPUS111 or Il Giardino Armonico on TELDEC. May Kyung Wha-Chung look for the Elgar or Korngold concertos next time or learn how to play the baroque fiddle."
2,Aa misfire,"If you were to hear this performance live you might be mildly pleased,but that does not explain adding another thoroughly mediocre performance of The Four Seasons to the catalogue.Simply a misfire."
1,Women over 50,The book is almost totally irrelevant to a woman's experiences in changing careers late in life. His only view of women is as a support system for a sucessful male. He has nothing to say about moving from being self employed to being in the job market. He has nothing to say about reclaiming your life when you have been the beneficiary of a medical miracle. He spends half of the book trying to teach men how to balance their lives. Working women are by definition expert on balancing life priorities. He has a chapter on learning how to communicate with people. Most women already have these skills. He assumes the subject will have an emotional support system in place. Single working female parents have to be their own support system.
5,Excellent Father's Day Gift - buy it!,This book is ideal for anyone considering a career change or wanting to get more fulfillment out of their work. It's very motivational. I thoroughly enjoyed it. And even better - it spurred me into action!
3,Too fragile!,"My son got this for Christmas - and enjoyed playing with it, but it just falls apart if he gets too exuberant - and this is wrestling! I do like how the case folds up into a sturdy carrying case, however. It would be much better if the whole item were sturdier."
4,Timex Expedition Watch T47512,"It's a Timex...good watch, fair price. The digital compass is pretty good, wouldn't use it for precision work but it's good enough to get you close for more macro tasks, e.g., general navigation. The compass is one of the main reasons I purchased the watch coupled with the Timex name, overall I'm happy with it so far."
5,Study the Sacraments,"An excellent resource for studying the sacraments. A down-to-earth workbook, probing the symbolism of communion and baptism, drawing on the reader's personal experiences in life and worship, and describing the services in ""The United Methodist Hymnal."" Each of the 12 chapters (6 on each sacrament) concludes with workbook style discussion and reflection questions. Can be used individually or in a group. The author is one of the ""deans"" of worship in the United Methodist Church."
2,a bit disappointing,"A meandering journey through the world of seafood and the American way. It's a decent book, and an addition to my kitchen bookshelf, but here's why the two-stars: the author has virtually nothing to say about sustainability and a fair number of the hard-working American fishermen she references use destructive methods like bottom-trawling, or things like seine nets that frequently trap marine turtles. The sections on preparing seafood seem rushed through and the author uses terms, utensils and techniques that are never defined - a real pain-in-the-arse for the novice seafood cook. As if this weren't enough, most of the recipes are portioned for serving 6-10 people, making it one of the last books on my list to whip out on a Tuesday evening for a quick dinner idea for the spouse-unit and myself."
1,GROSS!!!,"If you live in a part of the country where your only options as far as seafood are concerned are nasty old and stinky or frozen for three years then by all means cook some of the travesties presented in this book. If you have access to decent fresh fish then do yourself a favor, respect the creatures that gave their lives so you can eat, and don't smother them with cheese and heavy cream. With a few exceptions (butter and shellfish) heavy dairy products have no place on fresh seafood and this book asks you to to mask and violate the flavors and textures of quality fish with piles and piles of cheese (cheese and fish? GROSS!!) Like I said, if all you have is stinky, old, nasty fish then this book will provide you with great ways of disguising their flavors. If you have access to, and enjoy the flavors of quality fresh seafood please don't ruin it with these disgusting recipes. If this is ""Great American"" then this nation is in a sorry state."
5,I hope this book will be available again,"Dr. Boylan is a noted psychologist, anthropologist and college professor. The American UFO community has already paid the ultimate respect to his accomplishments in the field. Dr. Boylan was the first scholar and ufologist to elaborate on the concept of ""Stars Visitors"" that caused its influential mark on serious research in the paranormal and UFOs domains. I read this book years ago. And I found it to be a rich compendium both at a metaphysical and scientific levels. I hope a new edition shall be made available soon. Worth mentioning that the author has conducted extensive survey and research on Area 51 and the alien reverse engineering. Perhaps, a visit to his website will be beneficial to all those who are sincerely interested in expanding their knowledge of exterrestrials and their impact on humanity."
3,Not enough info,"I am sure I can use this guide in Vancouver, but I wish it had more detailed info, some pictures, some prices."
3,Compact,"Good compact guide book. Has nice maps. The organization of the topics are a little odd. I wish there was more than a few pages on Victoria. Great if Vancouver is your main destination. Some of the ""see page xx"" references are not correct, the editor messed up on the cross referencing of topics.Updated: Just got back from our trip to BC. Did not use this more than once! Had better info from the internet. And better maps too. If I could change the rating I would. Look at it a book store before buying, Good price at Amazon if you decide you want to buy it."
2,Dated even for a 2012 update,"I purchased this before a July 2012 vacation to Vancouver, encouraged by the good DK Eyewitness guides to European cities (which I've used and swear by).This guide for Vancouver claims it was updated for 2012, but there is a lot of dated and completely incorrect information on hours, restaurants (some of which listed apparently closed or changed policies long before the revision date and those changes are not reflected), and attractions.While this may be useful for the obvious highlights, I would not recommend it for the details."
4,The Sioux (Reviewed by Don Larson),"I found this book at an Indian Store in Escondido, California while attending a Pow Wow there in May 2000.I have been a follower of Red Cloud for over twenty years now and feel a great affinity for the Sioux Indians for some reason.My previous thoughts about what is was like to be a Sioux member were badly mistaken. This book takes the time to lay out the fundamental aspects of this tribe's, history, land movements, and cultural elements.The cultural elements include their beliefs and are quite profound. Descriptions are given to how an individual is treated as an infant, young child, young adult, and adult. The distinctions between male and female roles are explained fully.By the reading and absorption of the book's various chapters, I now have a much better appreciation for the difficulties the Sioux population experienced preceding the 20th Century.Anyone who truly desires to understand one of the most powerful Plains Indians tribes should read this book."
2,Good Idea,The idea is good-but the knob is hard to turn and it grinds up the cereal before it gets to the bowl.
3,needed more editing,"Author tries iconoclaism for its own sake. A valuable and largely accurate perspective on Unsoeld. Book is disasterously edited. Work is in what should have been only an early-stage draft. Leamer couldn't even be bothered with checking minor details and getting the spelling right. Leamer was on the right track, gunning for a big guy...but could've used another year to finish the job. Still, Unsoeld remains mysterious, extraordinary and respectable, despite all. Somebody else will have to do a more credible job..."
1,"I say, dash it!","Reading this book, one phrase kept floating to mind - dash it all. I think..... well, I don't know. This book, er, doesn't do justice to the concept of intercounty by-elections, what?"
2,Unreliable Foward/Reverse Switch...,"Had this screwdriver for several years with very light use. Its got a lot of torque and the pivoting handle is very handy. It held a charge very well through the lighter jobs I used it on. However, despite my limited use of this tool, the Foward/Reverse Rocker Switch went extremely intermittent on me with only one random firing of the Forward direction every 20 attempts. Reverse continued to worked fine. Very frustrating as the screwdriver was hardly used and otherwise worked great. Tried to pull it apart to see if a contact was dirty, but that was hopeless. Had to pitch the screwdriver and just bought a Black & Decker version instead... Perhaps I had a lemon, but why chance it?"
1,Pray the screw is not tight,One speed forward or reverse. Pray the screw is not too tight or risk injury. I have learned to hold the tool loosely and allow it to spin out of my hand rather than injure myself. I wish the people that designed the tool would have tested it before subjecting the public to potential injury. Had it been variable speed and had a clutch I would have given it top rating.
4,"Simple, Easy, Reliable",This cordless screwdriver is super simple and easy to use (duh).Does what it claims.
2,Disappointing,"For what used to be such a reliable and excellent brand,this is really a disappointing product.The grinder simply does not work properly, and requires a lot of effort for very little output.It seems that the pepper is not falling into or engaging as it should in the grinder.What's more, the pepper is ground too fine.I do not recommend this product."
2,Not worth the money,"Just finished taking NET,did not need Kaplans book, and neither will you if you prepare properly.Test is not that difficult,bone up on % and decimals and you will be ok with math.Kaplans book is loaded with two much useless information."
4,Kaplan Review Book,"This is a good book, but there is SOOOO much information! I recommend buying it WAY before you have to take the exam & becoming extremely familiar with the material before going to take the exam b/c the exam is really hard! I felt the material in the book was a bit overwhelming, but it was helpful. There was a lot of marking in my book which also wasn't the most helpful, but oh well, what can you do? Anyway, I would recommend the book for preparation!"
2,old messed up book,"the book is in a very bad shape, it is not supose to be sold to any body. Beside it is a property of a library, was it stolen?"
5,Well Built!,"I know that most of the reviews posted complained about how hard it is to get the cards in and out of the tight compartments, but that is what you want in a product that is shock-proof and waterproof that also floats. This way you know every card that's in it is definitely staying put and will be in its place.That being said, I would say, by the darn thing. You'll be glad that you did. I know I am. Hikers and nature photographers truly need this product. You can play catch with the dog with this product. Try it, but I would read the product disclaimer first before doing so. hahaha."
3,Vista drviers and Neximage magnification,"This does not ship with drivers for Windows Vista, and Celestron are not planning on releasing any. However if you login to Yahoo user groups and search for the Neximage group, there is a folder in the files section called 'Neximage vista' which provides drivers for Windows Vista which worked great for me.Also the magnification that you get from the Neximage is the same as what you would get from using a 5mm eyepiece on your telescope, so the length of your telescope divided by 5."
3,Celestron NexImage Solar System Imager,"this camera is basically for planetary viewing ... this is a starting point camera in my opinion ... and that's what i wanted ... once you get familiar with your scope and camera you can then decide if you want video or photos ... then the real money must be spent ... so i spent 100 bucks .. it saved a lot of money,,, if i had bought the wrong camera to start with i could have spent several hundred or thousands and wasted good money .. so its a great begging point.. i have a c-11 scope"
4,"Does what it's supposed to do - don't expect Hubble pics, though.","This is a great, affordable telescope webcam for images of the Moon, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Fair warning: you'll need to download the Phillips webcam drivers from the Phillips website if you want to get the camera to work with Windows 7.Also, you'll need to download a newer copy of the RegiStax photo-collating software. The one on the included disk is out-of-date, and a lot of new abilities have been added to the more current editions of RegiStax.I've had great results taking .AVI movies of the Moon and combining the images with the RegiStax software. Modeling and resolution are fair-to-good, with best results close to the terminator. The major downside of a webcam is that you can't create images with a resolution better than 640 x 480.As a beginner system, this is a great choice to dip your toe into video astrophotography."
3,Intial use,"This is a good start for a beginner in my opinion. The software included is laughably outdated, but locating updates is fairly simple. The device provides an acceptable image, however the resolution is very low (Unless it you have traveled back in time and 640x480 is the norm) and may put off more advanced users or those wishing higher quality images. I can't see this device used on a telescope without a motor drive unless it is used to observe land based objects or it is being used for live viewing on a laptop. The field of view is pretty tight, so it is important to insure that motor driven telescopes are configured and set correctly.No review on extended viewing or image stacking is available at this time due to seasonal high humidity and condensation forming on the lens of the telescope itself. Short tests were inconclusive.If your looking for a low cost way of trying CCD before investing hundreds or thousands into a higher resolution device, this appears to be a good choice."
3,Fair performance for the low cost,This device is a low cost (cheap) web cam so don't expect miracles. I am a beginner at astronomy so I am still in the 'frustrated' zone. You will not get the great images you see advertised. You will want to use a Barlow lens with it too.It is probably better to get the adaptors for your SLR instead of buying this imager.You will need to spend a lot of effort to get RegiStax to work nicely.Astronomy is more about enjoying the walk than getting to the destination. You should do some homework on astronomy forums/groups and rather buy the high quality items that will last you a lifetime than leave a trail of cheap and nasty accessories behind you.
1,Celestron NexImage,I was very disappointed with the nexImage. The barrel was crossed threaded and I could not remove it to insert the Celestron Neximager reducer lens. I called Celestron and they cofirmed that that is a problem with this device. They were to get back to me in a couple of days to resolve the issue. A week went by and no one called. Overall the product shows signs of poor workmanship. I returned the product back to Ace Camera. I am waiting on a refund. I would not recommend this product.
1,not a good camera,from the good reviews on here about this product despite the bad reviews I went ahead and purchased this camera. I was disappointed. I was able to get a vista driver off of a forum and the camera operated correctly but the results were less than spectacular. I used this with a orion xt10 telescope and the images that came through were fuzzy and blurry. I took better pictures by just placing my digital camera up to the eyepiece.
1,No Windows 7 Drivers,"Celestron really needs to catch up with technology. More and more people are running x64 operating systems and more and more people are upgrading from the very poor Vista OS to Windows 7. Celestron has no drivers for either Windows 7 or x64 systems. My camera is now a paper weight until I can find someone to ""dump"" it on."
1,"Works on Linux, but not in Windows 7.","I bought it on eBay long time ago.When I used it with my old laptop with Windows Vista 32:The camera worked, but since it is like an eyepice of 5mm it used to be very hard to keep the the image in the center of field. Maybe because I have no motor drive. The image was a disgrace, the RegisTax version old, and AMcap is a very bad program.Now with Windows 7 64 bits: There is no drive from celestron. Their web site tells us to get the phillips drive for SPC 900NC. But with it the AMcap no longer works. Other programs are working, but in 176x144 and not anymore in VGA.Now I will try any webcam with an adapter I just bought. Do yoursef a favor. Don't buy this. Try something else.Update: Ok. It is working now. but not in windows 7. It works in ubuntu Linux. Just get the movie with ""cheese"", save it as .ogv and then use ""devede"" to converte to avi."
3,Needs a little work,"Installation was a little bit of a chore. Error messages when installed on two different computers.Tech support from Celestron was no real help. Eventually I got it working on my laptop but not desktop (which is fine)Haven't been able to do any star gazing yet. Too cold outside.Just by playing with the software, I can see it will be a challenge.But that's half the fun."
1,Not for live video,"I bought the NexImage with the hope that it would give great live views of the Moon and planets. Images of the moon were sort of OK. But the images was too small, a 3'x3' window, on my netbook. When expanded up to ""full screen"" it became too pixilated. A live image of Saturn was just a fuzzy blob, no matter what I tried. I didn't try capturing and processing images as that's not what I wanted to do. It may work great for that, but I wanted good live views for public outreach events. Returned for a refund.Telescope used was a well cooled and collimated 6"" Celestron SCT."
1,Virus !,"When I tried to install the software, My antivirus said it was infected. I tried to install on a different machine with a different antivirus program and got the same result. I e-mailed Celestron over a week ago and no reply."
1,Very disappointed,I could not even install this camera as it is not compatible with Windows 7. I tried the patch but it still did not work.
1,wasted my money,This camera is not compatible with Windows Vista 64 bit operating system. If you're running 32 bit Vista you're fine except you have to download and install the new driver. I'll gladly sell you mine. It's never been used.
3,Less than expected,"I really enjoyed the show Stella, so I decided to purchase the Live in Boston DVD. Although I did enjoy seeing the guys perform live, I would probably pass on the TV show had this been my first impression of Stella. Some skits seemed to be nothing more than awkward segues into the next. Maybe I'm not hip to all the intricacies of Stella, but as a casual fan of the show, I was left wishing I would have bought a season instead."
2,Do not trust it.,"Do not trust any of Anti-Spam software. they just give you more Spams, include this one. After installing this software one week, i got double spam emails than before....Just use your email provider's filter tools and do NOT click the Spam emails. you will be safer. (This is my third Anti-Spam software)"
5,Great Book,"I love this book i read it when i was in grade 7. Justine is a 15 year old girl who just wants to be a ""normal"" teenager she meets Heather and her annoying brother Mike. she starts hanging around Heather and loves the attention she gets hanging around Heather. she finds out Heather is just a snoty teenager and likes to hang out with Mike more they have a lot in common and have fun together.they soon find out they are attracted to each other.its a story about how age does not matter and to look at the person from the inside and not care what others might say.....i think every girl should read it to find out how love could be...."
5,A rEaLlY CuTe sTOrY,"Another fabulous story by Ellen Wittlinger. Justine is a loner, and she prefers to be alone to read, write, and do what she loves most and that is see movies. And when her family moves to a new city Justine's mother wants her to make friends, hopefully with the girl who's family moves in next door. But that doesn't happen. First of all, the girl next door, Heather, is drop dead gorgeous, secondly she is popular which leads to the third problem, Heather ignores Justine. That doesn't sound like to good of friend material. So instead of making friend with Heather, Justine makes friend with Mike who is Heathers little brother by 2 years. Mike and Justine have many things in common and he is very fun to be with. But Justine is starting to fell things for Mike, she starts to become attracted to him and she starts asking herself this question, "" Is two years all that much difference?"" Very good book, if you loved Ellen Wittilinger's other books you are sure to enjoy this one."
4,This is a good book,I thought this book was very good. It is mainly about a girl social life wasn't very good for about a year until neighbors move in across the road where the girl named Justine met a boy in 8th grade named Mike and a girl in her grade of 9th named Heather. Justine and Heather don't really get along at all but Heather's little brother Mike and Justine get along like a couple. As the book goes on the story get more weird. As the story went on Mike and Justine start to make a movie about a girl and talking computer. When Mike and Justine are making the movie they start to get in like a relationship. Well that is all i can say about the book to not give the rest away.
2,HIghly Akward,"To begin, I am relieved that neither Spike nor Joie are in front of the camera like usual. I will give him one star for his creativity. He always brings that to the movie. I will give him the other star for tackling such strong content. Another character in his favor. However, he loses me with the whole flow of the movie. It seemed to be ""cut and pasted"" . It doesn't settle down into a story line. The editing is chaotic, the thought pattern is muddled. So there's no chance to really indentify with or connect with the character as with the other movies. As a result, it made the film hard to follow and just a screen full of Spike Lee going wild. This was far below of that he is capable of. This seemed to be a rushed project with issues that could have made two good projects versus one confusing one.The only redeeming quality comes from the alluding in my opening statement, the fact that Spike himself wasn't in front of the camera."
3,The inconsistent Lee strikes again,"After getting the shaft from his bosses because he blew the whistle on some corporate misdealings, a once up and coming executive accepts an offer from an old girlfriend to father her a baby (as you do!). This becomes a money making exercise when it is suggested that he do this for a number of other women.Some excellent moments, as you would expect from director, Lee, but this now standard mix of the sublime and the ridiculous has a little too much of the latter (even somehow fitting in the 'watergate' scandal to its convoluted ramblings!?). A number of good actors get precious little screen time and Spike regular, Turturro's, role is indicitive of the unnecessary tangents the film takes.Under the circumstances, Mackie, as the stud, does very well.......and don't worry, this is the kind of movie where the boy does get the lesbians! Maybe 2 1/2 stars is more accurate."
3,One of the few Spike Movies I like.,"I have to admit I am not that big of a Spike Lee fan, because a lot of his movies start great and end less than. Case and point, ""Mo Better Blues"" I loved that movie up untill the sappy ending, but I enjoyed ""Crooklyn"" all the way through. ""She Hate Me"" is a off beat movie that I enjoyed watching it was funny,deep, and had a raw sexuality to it. I the scene's between ""Alex and John"" and the scene between ""John and Mafia"" were left on the cutting floor, but should have be part of the picture. I even liked Jim Brown's low key and small part. So overall I would give this flim a B+."
3,Different,"I really had to pay attention to the movie, it was different just like the rest of Spike Lee movies."
3,On the Fence,"This movie really tried to take on too many subjects. had Mr. Lee focuses on just the relationships it would have been more interesting. I do, however, give him props on showing a loving monogamous relationship between two beautiful women. I just don't think that lesbians who are really gay and committed to one another would want to have affairs with men, even if it is to have a baby. But that is to be expected when you have a straight man writing about a subject he has no insight about. To me, the movie begins when he introduces the main female characters (fatima and the Dominican woman). Their story held my attention. The rest of the movie just went all over the place. But it's worth a buy based on that storyline, just fast forward through the rest!"
4,Interesting Moral Decision,"I thought the movie was very interesting,funny and well written. It forces you to think about choices in life when you are pushed to the edge like the main characacter."
3,Cool,"This movie was about as odd as any Spike Lee movie. I don't understand why one critic said it was all over the place. The plot was about a man who refused to keep a company secret that ended up getting him watched by the CIA (or was it the FBI?) and in the mean time, he slept with lesbians for money. The lesbian part was more comedic, but the situation with the secret behind the AIDS cure and the job problem went into how corporate America works and was a really important topic. Anthony played his part well."
1,"Very, very,very, bad!!!","Not only a horrible movie, but with out a doubt in the running for the worst movie of all time. Please don't waste your time. This is 2 hrs I'll never get back, and that makes me very sad."
5,Above Average Action,"I like Asia Argento & took a chance on this movie. I wasn't disappointed. I've rarely seen an action movie that is totally plausible & this was no exception. However, if you like action flicks with enough of a story to support the episodes of violence & mayhem you should enjoy this."
4,Asia is not just eye candy!,"I like this film and found it fresh and entertaining. Reminds me of the Transporter and thats not a bad thing.The mother in this movie is one evil hag, makes Cruella De Vil of 101 Dalmatians look like the SpongeBob.The whole darn cast is great and the action is non stop.You should check out this thriller."
5,"Lyrical, rich resonance!","What a gift this CD is- a perfect complement to the shifting shades of color outside my window. Soothing, warm melodies evoke a real lightness of being even as shadows fall earlier and earlier in the day. Whenever I play it, someone invariably sticks their head in my office and says ""what's that great music?"" Works for me!!!"
4,Very great!,"Came in good time, and I am very happy to own this! Overall is a great book for the beginning jazz pianist."
4,Pleasantly surprised!,"Works like Its supposed to, the wiring harness is a little flimsy, the connector didn't make proper contact at first. However after it was installed and working, the item actually works decent. Some minor glitches but it still sounds better than the radio modulator or the cassette adapter I had in the past."
2,Not so great,"iPod worked fine with the radio, but the unit caused my vehicles security system to go haywire. Random lights would flash on my dashboard, and everything on the right side of the gauge cluster would go dead. Very odd, and all caused by this unit. I have a 2003 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD. According to this products literature, this item should work fine with my vehicle. It does not."
4,Money well spent,"I recently got an ipod because the CD player in my truck no longer accepts or ejects CD's. I wanted the ipod to be able to be played through my OEM stereo to basically replace my CD player. This interface was the perfect thing for what I wanted. Sound quality is great, far better than the FM transmitters I have used in the past. Being able to change songs with my radio controls and charging the ipod battery is a definate plus. I give it 5 stars for everything execpt ease of installation, only because the directions could have been a little clearer. The installation took a total of about 45 min., including finding tools in my messy garage and soldering two connections. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who whats to play their ipod through their OEM stereo."
5,"I agree, great card!","I purchased this card for my new Garmin Street Pilot 2610 GPS unit. I wanted to simultaneously load the map/address/routing information for the entire western half of the United States into the Street Pilot. This was almost 400MB of data and it took only about 60% of the time to load for this SanDisk card as it had done with another brand of card.The speed difference really shows and I recognize now that this speed and quality is worth the extra ten or fifteen dollars! If you have a mega-pixel digital camera this is the card for you, too."
1,ordered on april 21 -- delivery estimate in june,"i placed this order a long time ago on april 21st, and i have yet to recieve it. the description said it usually shipped in about a week, then they changed it to a later date, then they changed in again. Now the description says the item is not in stock. This is too bad because i ordered my Canon Digital Rebel on april 20, and UPS came to deliver it today. Now i won't be able to take pictures until i get this card, and who knows when that will be.. hopefully this card will work well for me, and even though i am complaining about the poor service now, i will rate the ""true"" product when i recieve it... whenever that is. I have ordered from amazon in the past and this is my only negative experience so far."
1,can't be worse,"I have my nikon coolpix 5400, it comes with a start memory card from lexar media 8X (1.2M/s) speed, which has about 2 seconds delay on each shot. I bought this sandisk ultra II as it claims 9M/s writing speed and 10M/s reading. However, it tooks about 4~5 seconds for each shot EVERY TIME!!. I can't believe how they can put such brag in their ad..."
5,Works great with my D70,"I've used this card with my camera for about 6 months. No problems here, it delivers as advertised. As for the poor reviews directed toward Amazon.com (plug for amazon), I've purchased from them many times over the years, and as usual, it's always troublefree. Keep uo the good work!"
5,Great card!,"Bought one of these cards and I love it. I have a Canon 300d/Digital Rebel.I originally used a Canon 32MB card which performed horribly. It would take on average 10 seconds to write one JPG at the highest resolution.With the 512MB Ultra II card it takes from 1-2 seconds to write the same image. It also allows you to shoot continuous shots longer.With 6+ Megapixels--I think the 512MB card is the perfect size for a full day of shooting. I can get about 165-170 shots on a card. I am glad I did not get the 256MB card.Lastly, it also allows quicker image previewing from the camera, flipping between images is so so much faster. I think the extra money for this card is well worth it."
3,Lasts for a couple of years,"The card gave up on me after a couple of years of moderate use. A memory card doesn't have many moving parts so I thought it would last forever. Fortunately it broke when I was at home, it would have been a disaster if it was on a vacation on a small island somewhere in Asia.SanDisk only have one year warranty, even on these higher end cards. My next card is a Lexar Media 512 MB 80x Pro Series instead, they offer lifetime warranty. Makes more sense to me and it is faster too."
1,Totally disappointed,"I brought the card brand new, used it less than 5 times and it died during my own wedding.To make it even worse, pictures were not recoverable.My tips:*Think twice when buying this card*Buy couple small cards (say 256Mb)instead of one big card."
4,Enough memory for frequent download,"512 MB is enough for one batch of hi-res images downloading from my Nikon SLR camera to computer to process, modify, resize, and etc."
4,Almost as good as the first...,"I LOVED the first of the Lady series, but this one was also very good. I love seeing a different side of the regency women. I enjoy a good governess plot or heiress who tries to find true love in the midst of fortune-hunters typical romance novel, but this was more action, more daring, more sensual. These women are so much more in a time when they were nothing more than ornaments. I loving reading about characters with substance and inner struggles while surrounded by intrigue and adventure. I highly recommend Samantha Saxon as an author and encourage everyone to read this series!"
3,Hero's should always look cool....,"Nothing wrong with the actual story, but Daniel would have made a very good hero - he had the looks, integrity, and wealth- but he didn't come across as a very cool hero in spots. For example, he lost his 'ride' home and he's standing there wondering how he's supposed to get home. I REALLY don't want the hero in a helpless predicament. Another example, the author wrote - ""...wide shoulders covered by an ill-fitting russet jacket."" Now, why would I want to envision the hero looking ridiculous? And yet another example is when Daniel showed up at the costume ball. The way the author described him standing there - I don't know, it was just a turn-off. And afterward, we had to read about how Daniel had obtained the costume - it just wasn't what a hero would do, in my opinion. It didn't matter to the overall story, of course, but it definitely interfered with it."
4,This cartoon rocks!,"This is a cartoon about four planets (fire, rock, ice and bone) coming together as one to defend their solar system against the beast planet. This cartoon has great animation and action."
1,No a Happy Camper,I was not happy with at all with these clams.When I received them all the ice was melted and the clams felt warm to the touch. I put them in the refrigerator right away.We were having friends over the next night to cook them.When I went to open the bags and cooked them the smell was hard to miss. It smelled like they were spoiled.I ended up throwing them out fearing that they would make us all sick.I will never order from this seller again.
3,left wanting,"Yes, this is a good book for the most part. I agree with some other readers that it should have been a supplement to the compiler texts but maybe it came out before the better ones? I forgot BASIC and FORTRAN many years ago and this text does not help me recall the old language very well(maybe my IQ has slipped a lot)! My only complaint here is that it is way overpriced for what it delivers: I would have guessed it to be sold at maybe $35 not $55. Since Microchip have a new motor controller series out, perhaps I'll write about it myself if I discover something clever I can do...Geoffrey Campbell"
4,Very Good Resource,Hard to imagine being very productive with this techonology without this guide. Good textbook type technical explanations and good meaningful examples.
5,"Noticeable performance increase, but need to Dremel your cap.","This system fully replaced the old-school points and condenser on my Mercruiser 120.The installation instructions were clear and concise: my 20 year old daughter was able to retrofit the ignition system, including Flamethrower coil, in 1 hour. And she has fingernails and long hair.The unexpected part was the need to grind out a 1/8"" groove in the distributor cap for one of the new wires. I had a Dremel, and it took a minute or two to get it just right. Now YOU know.The engine fires right up and has no misfire at low speed like the original breaker point system. Top end has improved.I highly recommended this modification."
4,Pertronix Electronic Ignition,This product was an easy install that took about 10 minutes to complete. Directions were easy to follow and straight forward. This kit was installed into my boat and it has been operating fine on the original coil. I wish I did this years ago!
5,A great book for all,I bought this after watching an interview with Kathleen M. Cox. Found this book simple to follow and practical. Also highly recomended for those who always wonder in the scientific reason behind certain things. I highly recommend to all.
5,Surprisingly good,"From the liner notes:""'Calling Rastafari' is an anthology of Rastafarian roots reggae recorded primarily during a three-day period in early February '81 at the Harry J Studio in Kingston, Jamaica......When Culture arrived (at the studio), lead singer Joseph Hill looked broadly about and, seeing the Gladiators, Wailing Souls, Mighty Diamonds and Itals, said ""Dis yah a roots session.""That's all you need to know. Every cut is a previously unreleased, yet amazing version. The three Culture tracks alone make it an incredible album.There are some pretty cheesy reggae compilations out there, but this CD is one of the best roots albums I've heard."
3,Bookworm fails to deliver,"The copy of Bookworm is different than the download we used to learn the game. There are no ""bonus"" words. The definitions for educational purposesare accurate but rarely show up."
2,Old Mac game,"I purchased this game for someone that has an Apple (Mac) computer. When they went to down load it, it said it was an old one and was obsolete.I wish they had advertised for older Mac's."
1,wouldn't open on my Mac,This game would not open on my Mac. I play the game online and was looking forward to a more in-depth version. I didn't return it to Amazon because they have a big charge for returns.
5,Great mail box,"Very well made, heavy duty, and the magnetic door catch will make sure the lid never gets blown open in the wind/rain. Made in the USA!"
5,durable construction,Very heavy duty constructon. We also bought the matching newspaper box that was very easy to attach to the bottom of the mailbox. The mailbox is high quality. I like the unique handle on the door and there is a strong magnet which keeps the door securely closed. The flag is also very heavy duty and moves up and down smoothly. It has a very nice durable textured powder coat paint finish. I am very happy with the quality.
1,NOT Worth the money,"MAP 330 is NOT for street navigation as it does not give turn-by-turn driving directions, as advertised. It draws a straight line from start point to destination point and YOU have to figure out which streets to follow to reach your destination. The software has outdated database and failed to locate my house and some other locations which were successfully located by other softwares. Even software does not give turn-by-turn driving directions, but draws a straight line from start to destination. That leaves you fully dependent on printed maps to work out your route. I found free services (...) better than this expensive product."
3,Good basic guide,"There is a very condensed but fairly thorough introduction to color theory, pigments, paint, etc. in the beginning of the book. The color test swatches are useful, and I like that the book is organized by media. This is a great book for the painting one student or beginning painter. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a guide to mix browns from combining complements or mixing blacks. It is useful to see a brown formed by adding red to umber, but why not mix various reds and greens to get different browns, for instance."
3,Bunch of Charts,"This book is just a bunch of color charts showing how one color mixes with all the others such as how cadmium orange mixes with particular reds, yellows, blues etc. It is great for traditional media such as oils, watercolors, and ink, but is completely useless for digital art. I like the book, and it's great if you do oil painting and are looking for just the right color, but I think it's a bit on the pricey side. Still if you don't want to waste a lot of money buying colors you don't need this is a good book to buy."
4,"Not what I expected, but still good","Thought it would be more about the basic theory, but this book is very specific about how each color interacts with another. Great charts, but not sure how useful it will be for me. Still searching for a good theory book."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was simple to understand and quite interesting. I'm sure it's not the end all in color mixing books, but it is not a bad one at all."
3,Excellent mood minus memorable melodies,This work almost attained a 4-star rating because of the excellently conveyed mood for the tragic (and rather grisly) folk legend/love story upon which its based. More memorable melodies would have kept me listening.
3,Very good music for lovemaking!,My wife and I had a very enjoyable evening while listening to this CD
4,40 Too Long,Got what I paid for. Received when promised. No defects or scratches. One of Dices best CDs. Not for everyone but if you like Dice you will like this CD. Highly recommended.
4,great album,great dice album. very funny.not is best but still well worth the purchacegreat jokes. good old fashioned racism
5,simply.......HILARIOUS,"my god, this is funny!!! what a cd, just hilarious, non-stop laughter!!! if you are a fan of andrew dice clay, and have not heard this cd yet, get it!!!! one of the best, very funny, highly recommended!!!"
5,Exciting and inspiring story from Ireland's history.,"Red Hugh Roe O'Donnell, with the help of the MacSweeny, O'Neill and O'Toole clans fights for the freedom of Ireland in the late 1500s. This true episode (one of the greatest in Irish history) is recounted with verve and wit. Even though billed as a ""young adult"" book, I believe everyone will enjoy this exciting and inspiring tale. If you are looking for a way to interest anyone (young or old) in European history, give them this book -- I guarantee it will whet their appetites. Excellent all around!"
4,Pretty fun read.,"Red Hugh is a book set back in time, about a prince and what he went through before he became the king.I really enjoyed the book, but my sister thought it was too boring.The first 7 chapters or so are about his life and how perfect it was, but after that things go downhill fast.Red Hugh O'Donnell is kidnapped, and spends much of the book after the 7th chapter in captivity.He is a brave prince that always manages to do the right thing."
3,sorta works,in the forums people have trouble with the '96 because cadillac wired it stupid so the factory stereo got 17V. you can use this adapter but you'll have to run a new ACC wire. I used the pink wire powering the passenger side window and ran it behind the glovebox. this way it still has the retained power
3,Not much control.,I guess this is better than nothing at all. It has been down for two months with heavy mulch. Grass and weeds are popping up everywhere.
3,"On his own, this CD was a disappointment, for me.","I can appreciate his desire to play jazz and there are several songs that are very nice and I suppose worth the cost of the CD. However, after listening to years of his collaborative works with R. Carlos Nakai, I was disappointed with this CD. It is probably great for jazz enthusiasts, of which I am, which is why I don't understand why I couldn't really get into this CD. Perhaps it's just the band of instruments with him. Think I'll sell it as I've tried to enjoy it since 1994 but still, it doesn't move me."
4,Give Us More!,"Both tracks are extremely dancable. Full of enough high energy to keep you moving. Both tracks have an extreme high beat build-up with an eventual release into some serious sound. Orgasmic is the only word. But I need more - 2 tracks just isnt enough, after a long search I found something. A cd titled John Blair Party - Volume 1, DJ David Knapp. Both songs are featured on this dance compilation, along with 10 other artists. If you would like a good dance cd, I suggest you check it out. Search for album title - John Blair Party here on Amazon.com."
3,"Weak... or maybe ""Average"" at best.","I'm sorry but I don't see anything special about this track. It feels very dated and unoriginal. Although it is not a ""bad"" track, it definately does not have anything that would set it above the rest. Yes, it has a hard beat, it has build ups... but it's much to formulaic for my taste. From the reviews that I read here, I was expecting something more."
4,This CD is awesome!,If you love to move to good music then you will absolutely love the trip. Great groovin song with awesome beat..
3,MORE SPACED OUT THAN PREVIOUS EFFORTS,"Wolf eyes seem to have veered away from the harsh digital industrial machine poundings of burnt mind and slicer and instead moved toward a more crushing and epic form of ambience on this album. All of the tracks are echoing and cavernous, creating a feeling of the listener being lost in a large dark and cold space where your breathing is amplified in jet black tunnels. the terror you feel is your own, this music is a rorschach test asking you"" what do you fear? . does it sound like THIS??????"""
