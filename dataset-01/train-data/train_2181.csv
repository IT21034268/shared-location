3,A Great Woman's Book,"This is a fun read -- perfect for the plane, beach, or rainy day. It's about marriage, motherhood, and redefining oneself. And just because it is fun, does not mean it cannot tackle big issues: the impact that technology has made in our lives, what happens after instant success, and the importance of self-discovery.Caroline Preston has crafted a great story, tackling big issues with a light touch."
1,one of the worst books I've ever read,"If you didn't see the ending to this story within the first 40 pages, you're in serious denial. This was the most contrived, laughably bad book I think I've read since Sweet Valley High. The stereotypes of the characters are sophomoric, and the storyline has been done, done, and redone. I read it like you watch an awful made-for-TV movie - it's so bad you can't tear yourself away. ugh."
4,The Anatomy of Courage,"As a mom of the military, I found the book written by the WWI physician fascinating. However, I couldn't help wonder if Lord Moran would come to different conclusions today if he could read new research and medical findings concerning Traumatic Brain Injuries and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder."
1,Worst Buying Experience of my Life!,"The product was cheaply made and had a foul odor; the car charger did not fit; the price of the product (as well as the shipping charges) was exorbitant. My correspondence was ignored until I filed a formal complaint with Amazon to get a refund!After reading reviews for this company, it seems the problems arise when trying to return products. Don't be willing to take that chance. Take my advice...stay as far away as possible from this company. Believe me, there are many other reputable companies out there that value their customers and have great customer service."
5,Works great,This product really protects your nintendo ds lite and has a small net pouch in the top to store a few games and an extra stylus!! Very handy - and the car charger is great to use when traveling by car!!I really recommend this one to everyone who owns the ds lite!!
5,An Absolute MUST for the true Sooner Fan!!!,"This book gives you a game by game account, with stats, of every game the Oklahoma Sooners played from 1970 all the way through 1979!! A MUST have book for the true Sooner fan!I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOVE THIS BOOK!!! I DO!!By the way when amazon asked me too rate this book in either 1 to five stars..I LIED!!! THIS BOOK IS 10 STARS!!"
4,A Neat Toy.,"This unit is a neat little toy. It works well and is fairly accurate. The only thing I noticed is it takes a decent launch to activate it. So sorry to all you kids with the 4 cylinder imports that have trash can mufflers with 60 horsepower, you may not be pleased with this unit :)"
5,No guessing with this compass,"I'm a Sr RF Engineer and in need from time to time to 'shoot' the azimuth of wireless cellular antennas. I've used this compass for over 7 years and, with practice, you can get to within 1 degree of accurate confident reading (+/- 5 degrees being the standard). With adjustable magnetic declination, there's no room for error and no need for calculation since it's a 'direct reading' compass. Whether from the front, the back or even 90 degree offset, this compass should be in every RF Engineer's bag."
1,husker13,The anticipation for installing this faulsely advertised product was great. The ad work says it will install on a Windows PC or Macintosh. My iMac running OS X 10.6 is apparently not included as it cannot be used on this new version of the Macintosh computer. Do not purchase this item unless you have a 10 year old computer. Complete waste of money. The supplier indicates that there is no refund available.
3,CREEPY BIO OF SKATER WHO FELL HARD,"Skatebarding phenom Mark ""Gator"" Rogowski's rise and fall is chronicled in STOKED (Lions Gate). Helen Stickler's compelling film begins with an almost benign look at California's skateboarding revival in the mid 1980s then tightens on Rogowski, a cocky half-pipe performer who collected fame and fortune as an endorser. But when the spotlight moved off him to the more radical street stunts by new players, his life, ego and mind apparently imploded into a dark hole. This creepy true-life parable includes a jail interview with a now thirty something Rogowski. Thus scary bio about a skater who fell badly hits hard and is memorable. A unique film by a talented filmmaker."
4,"Great Film, But Don't Pity This Monster","This movie is a fascinating watch and I thoroughly enjoyed the history lesson and watching the not so unexpected capitalist takeover of skateboarding. It happens with everything that can be considered ""hot"" and ""marketable"" to young people who spend money.As far as Gator himself goes, he bought into the hype and you could see what a joke he was in the latter stages of the film. He may have been a great skater and a nice guy but the most telling interviews are those conducted with the police officers and the court footage. Gator murdered this poor girl w/o even knowing her very well. He incapacitated her head with severe blows which caused massive bleeding. He then proceeded to take her to his room and cuff her and sexually assault her for 3 HOURS. Then he stuck her in a surf board bag and strangled her before dumping her body in the desert.REAL NICE GUY"
5,satisfied,I highly recommend this movie to anyone that skated during the late eighties. Especially if you lived in southern Cal at the time. Very intense!
3,"Good book, but doesn't interest me.","I know the book Obsession has met with rave reviews. John Douglas is the king of FBI profilers, but I didn't think the book was all that. It didn't hold my interest and I found myself skipping pages."
5,book,i love reading john douglas books. the book was very interesting and i loved reading it. and i learned a lot from it.
3,Didn't quite hit the mark,"I read this book as a follow-up to ""Mindhunter"". The bar was set pretty high with Mindhunter so it was inevitable that I'd be disappointed. It's not bad, just not great. Again, I was expecting another Mindhunter, but I didn't get it. And I don't think you will, either."
3,Less that what I had expected to educate the reader.,"I found this book did an excellent job at profiling the various criminal types but did not do as good informing the reader how to avoid them. The advice appeared limited to being aware of your environment and to remain calm. Ihad expected more concrete advice, perhapsfor each crime senario described what might have worked for the victim(s)."
3,Not his best work,"I've read several other John Douglas books, including Mindhunter, Journey into Darkness, and my favorite,The Anatomy of Motive. Obsession just seems weak in telling the stories in a compelling fashion. I'd recommend one of his other books, particularly for first time readers."
3,Not nearly as good as Douglas and Olskaker's other books,"I have read Mindhunter, Journey Into Darkness, and Obsession. And I must say, Obsession was not nearly as interesting as the others. I don't know if it's that John Douglas is running out of things to say or if the crimes of serial rape and stalking are just not as intriguing as serial murder. I personally hope that his next book, Anatomy of a Motive, is more similar to his first two."
3,you're right...not as good as the others,"This book seems to lack the detail that made Mindhunter and Journey Into Darkness two thrilling books, however, I'm half way through and I still feel compelled to read it through to the end...."
2,Mostly Repeat of Mindhunter,"Love the author, loved Mindhunter....but...if you've already read Mindhunter, don't waste your money...a lot of the same stories and material. If you haven't read Manhunter, go for it."
4,Stalking The Monster,"Having read all of the books John Douglas has put out regarding his time as an FBI profiler, the first thing that came to mind is why he didn't crash and burn from the constant drumbeat of depravity. To say that we need someone of this level of commitment to stand between us and that kind of immorality is an understatement. I thought I would not like grim and graphic descriptions of his work. I was wrong. The book is taut, enlightening and scary, all at the same time. He cites specific cases including the preppie murder case and brought to the surface aspects of the case that I had been previously unaware. It is tough to make such a narrative read as a thriller but I think that Douglas and his co-author Mark Olshaker have done the best they can with the glut of the material. I highly recommend it to any and all who desire to make sense out of the senseless. Douglas and Olshaker do their best to make it understandable."
3,worth reading.. but not Douglas's best,"This is the fifth John Douglas book I have read. I have found Obsession to be the least interesting of the five. I love reading about actual cases and the hunt for criminals. This book lacks a lot of that and instead focuses more generally on the types and behaviors of offenders. The best part of the book focuses on the three real-life serial killers that were used as a basis for Buffalo Bill and Hannibal Lecter in ""Silence of the Lambs"". Overall, I would have to say that ""Mindhunter"" and ""Journey Into Darkness"" are definitely my favorites. This book, ""Anatomy of Motive"" and ""Unabomber"" were not quite as good although the unabomber's manifesto is really interesting."
2,Rambling presentation,"The most interesting information in this book was found on a few pages near the end- a description of the bizarre case that inspired the ""Buffalo Bill"" character in Silence of the Lambs and the famous movie Psycho. The rest of the book was a long presentation of classifications of types rapists, details of some cases, some law enforcement programs to work with victims, and some advice for victims- both past and potential. Contains editorial about how certain types of serial offenders cannot be rehabilitated- the ones who enjoy what they do and repeatedly decide to do it. Overall there was some intersting information here, but you have to labor to get to the end of this book."
1,"Long on preaching, short on teaching","I bought this book after reading John Douglas' first 2 books. I have to say this book was a huge disappointment. The actual substance of the book could easily be boiled down to less than 100 pages. I suppose the authors felt that this wasn't enough so they rambled on and on about some woman named Fairstein who works in New York (one of the authors seems to have some sort of 'crush' on this woman) and other barely relevant and mostly uninteresting topics. At one point I started to wonder if this book was actually about Miss Fairstein and not about profiling at all. The details of actual cases and methods for profiling and solving the cases (for the ones that were solved) was as interesting as ever, but the long winded philosophizing about controversial subjects that did not relate to the cases or the process of solving them was extremely annoying. Each chapter could be cut in half by simply deleting all the long sermons and pointless rambling."
1,Obsession...of what?,"This book started out to be a really interesting book, but it was almost like reading a lecture. What could have been a real page turner was repetitive, dry, and boring. Actually, I got so bored with the book (unusual for me) that I didn't even finish it. I was prepared to not be able to put this book down, and I'm sorry to say that it was a real disappointment."
2,Profiler preaches more than he probes,"This book fufills the title's promise in that it provides an interesting if disturbing look at obessive and violent criminals, it fails to fulfill the promise, however, of telling us ""How to Fight Back."" Instead, the authors spend far too much time preaching about how shamefully we treat victims in this society (a premise with which I wholeheartedly agree). The authors' sharp and stilted writing style only serves to make this preaching feel more like an angry attack and less like an informed persuasive argument. I bought this book primarily for the ""How to Fight Back"" part the title promises and I was seriously disapointed as I read on and on, through all 384 pages of it, and never found more than the common sense instructions to be aware of my surroundings and to hopefully wait for society to take more responsibility for both victim and criminal."
2,Repetitive and disappointing,"This book is filled with repetitions, long wined prose, and the oversize ego that marred Mindhunter. There is less insight and interest than in his book Anatomy of Motive. Motive is a far far better book; read it and pass on this one."
5,A must have!!,"I recently started stamping cards and was so happy to have this book as one of the first in my library!! I loved the unique, classy designs - easy and fun to do!! The step by step instructions are great and the color pictures are very helpful. I shop at a local Impress store and love it! Each time I go in I have to control myself - they've got more great ideas in the store!!"
4,Satisfactory starter ideas-Exclusive product use is imminent,"I live in Washington, and spend more time than my husband would like in ""Impress"", whose owner penned this book.It is a great book for style and substance..but most of all, starters. The designs are not too complicated for the early - medium crafter, but will require specific tools.Ms. Perkins has great creativity (or a fabulous design team), which is evident in this book - but the suggestions also utilize several items exclusive to the ""Impress"" line of stamps and products. This fact wasn't as helpful to the friend I sent it to in Hawaii. She really loved the designs, but was apprehensive about spending so much on products and shipping from the author's web store.All in all, I do use this book, and add my own sense of personal style to the building blocks she has laid before us in ""Stamping with Style"". Worth a look. ~*~"
5,WONDERFUL IDEAS!,This book has easy to follow instructons and great ideas. I created beautiful bridal shower invitations using a technique from this book and the raving comments are non-stop! I even have potential orders for future invitations and cards! Ordering this book on-line saved me from paying full retail at my local rubber stamp store! A+++++!
3,Stamp with Style,"has a lot of card projects, but not for beginners or someone who doesn't want to spend a fair amount of time making cards."
3,Paperback version is ONLY a workbook,"Please note, if you order paperback, it is not the text of the hardback version, but only problems to work on."
2,Not worth the money,"I have great admiration for the parent text (Options as a Strategic Investment), however this study guide smells of a publisher's naked attempt at milking the brand for a few more quick bucks. I found it to be lazy in its inception. Like some summer intern was assigned the job of putting it together. Is it just me or are some of the answer key entries wrong? I found that very frustrating. I strongly recommend the text. You'll miss nothing by skipping the study guide."
1,wrong book,"I thought I had ordered the book not the study guide. I ordered the book as recommended reading of an instructor of mine, so I was very careful about my selection. I live in Mexico and it has taken over a month for the book( a study guide to the book) to arrive. I am completely dissappointed and at a complete loss as for what to do...If anyone from Amazon reads this review, please consider this my request for you to send me the correct book, at the same address as before.thanks ???"
1,boring,"I could barely finish it, it was so dull. I am a documentary nut and I love fashion so I thought this would be a good fit. Nope. Skip it and get The September Issue instead - that one's great."
5,Packed with excellent suggestions,"This book and tape really got me through my surgery. Many wonderful suggestions for preparing yourself mentally and physically. I used the tape on the way to the hospital and post-surgically to relax. It is also really helpful for falling asleep even after you have healed. A great, great book and tape."
1,What a disappointment,"I didn't realize I was getting an audio cassette, but decided to try it out prior to my major surgery. It is totally useless. The woman's monotone voice repeats the same few lines over and over, saying the same things one can say to oneself in medication. ""Relax your left toes."" ""Go deeper."" ""Now relax your left knee."" I was expecting at least some instructional narrative about PREPARING FOR SURGERY! Maybe it was necessary to buy the book and tape together,..."
1,An RN's review,"I coordinate a cardiac rehabilitation program and use this tape as part of the stress management education. Although the title refers to surgical healing, there is no mention of surgery during the tape. All my patients report a relaxation response from listening to the tape in class, and many have requested the title and source for home use. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Not the best,It's awful 80's dreck. The only thing saving it is that Carl Palmer is on drums - at least there's no drum machine! It won't find my CD player again for a long time.
4,"Bloc Party's best song, and their worst remix","""Tulips"" is a non-album single from Bloc Party. If you're a fan of this band, you have no excuse not to own this, as it is possibly their finest song to date. I gave it 4 stars because its only B-side is a lackluster remix of the A-side."
3,uneven work here.,not a bad album. Boutte is a much better singer than this album portrays. Choose another one by him. It's only fair.
4,Classic NOLA tunes,John Boute is great. He has an array of styles true to the region. Full of soul and life. Paints a picture of life in this great city! The title song is my favorite on this disc.
3,Disappointed,"After seeing John Boutte' at French Quarter Fest 2006, I had to have his CD. This CD doesn't have any of the passion or verve I saw on stage and I find that disappointing."
1,Self aggrandizing,"If there is a Donald Trump in the nanny business Ms. Kline would surely be hosting the next Apprentice show except that she does not seem to have the same gravitaz that Mr. Trump demonstrates. Name-dropping and full bragging of how important she is to the ""over achieving"" parents who are basically folks trying to integrate work and family lifestyles does not make Ms. Kline a likeable decent person. (Whether you agree with how the parents are spending their time or not)Instead of being empathetic, Ms. Kline comes across as a self-ordained I-am-a-very-important person in Washington. She brags about the fact she can choose you as a client and gets more important clients than she really cares for.The book is a quick easy read, but there is no substance and a lot of snide remarks on Ms. Kline's clients make her a character that any parent should stay away from."
1,Just plain dumb...,"When I saw this in the library, I guess I was expecting another version of The Nanny Diaries, which was cute. This ""novel,"" however, was poorly written and jumped all over the place; there were no smooth transitions at all. It was basically one big promo of her company--any time she mentioned a ""horror story"" she was quick to add that it wasn't one of HER nannies. Basically, I thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders I teach. It took me about an hour to read, after which I thought, ""How did THAT get published?"" If you want to read a nanny book, try the Nanny Diaries. This book is stupid."
2,Poor payback for clients,"We have used White House Nannies and they did a fine job. After reading this book, however, I would be reluctant to use them again. I own a business and would never dream of violating my clients' privacy the way Kline does in this book. She is quite nasty, and unnecessarily so, as many of the stories speak for themselves. Sure, it's easy to mock power couples, but this is Kline's main source of income -- shouldn't she show a little more class?Some names are real, others (I think) are not. Given the highly sensitive nature of the book, some clarity on this point would have helped.For those not bothered by the ethics or the tone, there are some interesting stories and genuine insights into the nanny-parent relationship. Still, I'm rather sorry I contributed to the author's profit for such a mean and self-promoting book."
5,Read This Book Now,"If you ever had, or were, a baby, a baby-sitter, a parent, or a nanny you will LOVE this book. It tells the truth about how hard and how important it is to find quality child care. Many scenes and vignettes seem unbelievable but I know from long experience that they are all true. The most memorable is the mom who pours M&M's like cereal for her child. I give this book 5 stars but it really rates 10!"
1,Don't waste your money--,"I checked this book out under the new section of the library, and found it to be just an awful read. The whole nanny thing is becoming a bore, a re-tread topic, and Barbara Kline is no P.L. Travers. Still, I don't know what was worse--the ""exposure"" of these women/couples who give birth and then turn their children over to surrogates to raise--or the reality that the nannies themselves are ""maxed out."" The best part of the book was the Caitlin Flanagan quote (she's a fabulous writer) at the beginning. I'm not surprised that Chris Matthews and wife allowed themselves to have their ""nanny"" situation included in this book."
5,She nailed it!,"Barbara Kline has penned an extremely well written page turner that absolutely nails the nanny industry in the U.S. today. I should know, I own a nanny agency myself. She has been fair to both nannies and the families who hire them and her sense of what works and what doesn't passes the test of time and experience. You root for her families who are trying to have it all--career and family, and you cheer for the nannies who make it all happen. There is not a slow page in this fast read. Barbara is a caring, competent agency owner and it is great that someone of her intelligence and ethical standards has taken the time to share her experiences, her common sense and her humour. If a good book makes your day, this is today's read. Karen Walker Ryan, President, Heartland Caregivers Inc."
3,Cute Read,"While the title of the book is kinda misleading (I thought this was a book about actual nannies of the White House) it is a cute read. I personally wouldn't have wanted to be the families picked in this book but then again, she had to get their permission to write it!!"
1,Enough name-dropping already,"I bought this book because Kline was signing copies in a bookstore in Baltimore. Everyone said it was funny. I'm 50 pages into it, and I have to say that I am already so sick of her exposing the private lives of her clients and dropping names left and right (one of THE most annoying DC traits, I must say). She is clearly trying to ride the wave of the popularity of The Nanny Diaries. It is NOWHERE near as funny or interesting, and at least Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus had the decency not to name names. As one of the other reviewers stated, this is just an advertisement for herself. I actually considered returning to the bookstore and asking for my money back. What a sore disappointment."
3,Meh,"There were some entertaining stories but overall the book was too disjointed, jumping around and never seeming to tell a complete story"
2,A book with 2 personalities,"This book gives the impression of being 2 books pieced together. The first part is a somewhat cursory account of Archerfish's famous exploit of sinking the Shinano, a story recounted elsewhere much more comprehensively. Once that part is out of the way, the remaining 3/4 of the book deals with the boat's later history, or more accurately, the hijinks of the various crews, which all sound like the submarine equivalent of McHale's Navy personnel. This is probably entertaining to ex-USN enlisted types but didn't entertain me much and I started losing interest fast. I think that the bargain price reflects the true value of the book."
2,this book was NOT all that!,"this book wasn't all that great and I didn't like it all that much! it was pretty funny, but I thought it was pathetic that everybody liked harvey because he sounded like elvis!"
4,7-outlet surge protector,"I chose this particular unit because of its capacity and shape; it had to fit behind a dresser and provide at least 3 outlets, plus coax protection. I have had good results from Tripp Lite products in the past, but have no hard data on this one. It appears to be of good construction and is a good shape for my purposes. I believe that it will provide adequate protection in this application, which includes 22"" LCD TV, VCR and cable box."
2,not very practical,"Everyone seems to buy this book as a reflex, but I hardly have used it in the last year I've had it as a PMR resident. It can be helpful sometimes when preparing a brief topical discussion, but it is not specific enough in terms of what should be done clinically. It's so big it's difficult to take it anywhere with you if you need to study for the boards."
4,a lot heavier than braddom,Some excellent chapters in the new text make this a good reference to have handy. Odd but important little topics on vestibular rehab and so forth.
1,Awful-most uncomfortable shoe ever had!,Do NOT and I repeat - Do NOT buy this shoe unless you're into torture of your feet! This shoe is not worth it even if they gave them to you FREE.
2,"In the class of documentaries, this is pathetic","I enjoy historic documentaries of places that have been lost to time and nature. The details of their heydays and history should be at least a little educational. This was nothing but the film of old advertising, some home movies (set to a soundtrack) and a musical slideshow. I've seen at least one other documentary on the Salton Sea that did not insult one's intelligence. I recommend everyone save their money, this wasn't worth the price."
5,Irritable Male Syndrome Cure,"I got this book after reading an article on Irritable Male Syndrome on AOL/WebMD/MSN. First, this book contains a wealth of information about men, testosterone and the effect of foods on the levels of testosterone in a man's body. It is written with a lot of ""female"" related humor, which is why most men grab the book from their wife as she falls to the floor in hysterical laughter. Not only did my gladiator shed 10 pounds easily, but our relationship became much better because he wasn't as ""irritable"" from work stress."
3,Not For Men,"While the principles may be sound, this book is an annoying read. It is written for women who want to change their men, not for men interested in nutrition. It is not very technical, and is sprinkled with cutesy little sexist remarks like ""Afraid he'll think you're serving him a portion fit for a sparrow instead of a vulture? Use smaller plates. (Men are so easy to fool!)"".Very disappointing.Update:While I stand by my original objections I would like to change my rating from 1 to 3. First of all, the information provided in this book is important for those who don't know it.Secondly, I have found that I consult the book more frequently than expected. I have recently heard positive news about the author's expertise and willingness to help people. I would have preferred to see more of that expertise in the pages of this book (more science, less fluff)."
2,"Useful information, poorly presented","The good doctor has useful information, but you have to wade through some unnecessarily technical nutritional jargon to get to it. Add to that the stilted attempts at hip humor, and you have an awkwardly written book.The recipes are also tough to live with (what in the world is steel cut oatmeal?)I recommend that you skip this book and buy Testosterone Advantage Plan in paperback. The nutritional info is easier to understand, much more useful, and the diet is something you can live with."
3,Cellphone Battery,"It is difficult to love or like a battery! It was as expected.............. The battery worked just fine, but the cellphone still was unusable even after a Tech from India told me to get a new battery. The phone had to be replaced."
1,stay away from this vendor,"worst experience ever with an on-line vendor. sent bc50, and it doesn't work, and bargaincell has not tried to resolve the issue. amazon has not been of help."
2,THESE ARE EXTREMELY EARLY 1950s RECORDINGS,"Customers should note that these songs, mostly taken from old 78 rpm discs, date from Petula's earliest recordings in the late 1940s and early 1950s. They do not sound at all like the mature Petula from the mid-1960s forward, when she began singing with a sexy and swingin' sound."
2,huh?,Why are the costs of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment not called into question from the point of view of the corporations that benefit from this system? Maybe some industries are too important to allow profiteering from?
1,do you really want to read a 208 page whine?,"This starts well, the car jacking is horrible and superbly written. However pre and post the jacking Brad Land simply whines. He whines about not being as good as his brother, about not getting the girl he wants, about not know where he is going in life. He then gets to college and whines about fraternities and whines about....well everything.Any patience you have for him dies by about page 120, it is just none stop whinging. And what happens to him that is so bad? To be honest his 'hazing' experiences seem about as harsh as a boys night out on the beer. So he drinks a lot? smokes a lot? gets laid a few times? feels socially uncomfortable....who doesn't now and then.Not recommended at all unless you, like Brad, like to whine - maybe for his next book he can tell us how horrible it is to go shopping or how terrifying it is to use a public toilet."
2,Did I Miss Something?,"I am a recent college graduate, so the premise of the story was definitely intriguing to me. The beginning of the story was written in such a choppy and direct, yet appealing style that I was excited about the possibilities of where this book would take me. As the story went on though I found that the ""twist"" or ""spin"" that I expected the story to take never occurred. From the first chapter this book gets progressively worse until you are left closing the book in disappointment. I love Land's style of writing. That was the only thing that kept me interested just enough to finish this book. I would pass on this story, but I am interested in seeing Land's creative technique combined with a worthy story to go along with it."
5,dealing with deamons,"In this book, Brad Land, does an outstanding job describing what he went through. I felt that I was standing there on that same ground beside him. ""The Thing"" as they would refer to it was life shattering and his dependancy on his yournger brother to help him through it. Family and brotherhood are shown to be quit different. In the frat house, Brett, Lands real brother realized what they were doing to the pledge class is somewhat similar to what Brad had gone through a year ago. Brad and Brett's love for oneanother is what gets them both through ""the Thing"". Awesome book."
2,Zzzzzzzzz,"Ok, the random attack is kind of freaky, mostly insofar as it sends this writer into a sort of depression that certainly comes across in the writing. His description of fraternity life didn't seem that scandalous or revealing; perhaps the violent attack made such an environment more ominous than it actually was. The writing is whiny and kind of drags; I felt that, heavily edited, this would have made a much better magazine piece. If you're looking for a great account of walking through hell in a gasoline suit, I'd tell you to check out James Frey's ""A Million Little Pieces,"" but you probably already have."
2,reader and liker of memiors,"...Is the prose ""amazing,"" and the narrative ""uniquely hip."" Sweet Christ on crutch it is not.The subject alone is powerful enough to carry the story, and does not need I don't think a melodramatic, bad nickname-giving, grad schooly nonfiction voice to stand between us and the stuff that went on. There's the sensitive-observer-in-a-harsh-world approach, and in that case the observer becomes important. JT LeRoy's work is a good example, but the problem is that almost no one is anywhere near that good, including Mr. Land, who even with the help of Random House's editors, sounds like a whole lotta other memior-writing-at-the-time-where-memior-sells writers, whose pasts are self-inflicted, and whose talents are not proportional to the number of zeros on their paychecks."
2,Sour Grapes and Imagination,"After reading the book I found myself to be skeptical of what Mr Land had written. His writing style was trite with a ""poor me"" tone about it. Attending a small liberal arts college, Hillsdale with a student population of 1000 about 70% of the students were at that time affiliated with the Greek system. Many were sons, nephews and grandsons of alumni affiliates. Our members were never met with the violence,degradation, lunacy and the like Mr Land describes........how long was he an active member? Not only do I not commend his writing style it seems apparent that he's written a very one sided piece of fiction set to further damage the Greek system. Don't waste your time on this drivel. And should you, remember to tell yourself that this man has one hell of an imagination stemmed from very obvious resentment."
2,Boring and Pathetic,"I love the cover - that goat would make a cool tattoo!The book itself was very boring, lacked purpose, and came off as quite pathetic. I have no problem with a 'cloudy day' book...but I really missed the point of this one. I mean it's terrible what happened - but shocking things happen everyday - just pick up the paper. This book was not shocking, not interesting and definitely not inspiring in any way shape or form."
2,the Passive-Agressive Handbook,"i wasted my time reading this book. while Mr. Land has a remarkable attention to minute detail, i am left at the end of the book unmoved. in short, i find his indictment of Clemson University to be wholly unfair. in addition, the horrible events detailed in this book? he caused them by his own actions.this book seems like a passive-agressive way to get back at people whom the authour was unable to stand up to while the events unfolded in real-time. throughout, i'm convinced that trouble started for him and his brother long before the events of the book (child abuse? maybe?) but are never touched upon. maybe Mr. Land is saving this for his next book?"
2,Style over substance,"As a former fraternity member, this did nothing to capture the essence of fraternity life, or hazing for that matter. Also, the writer tried so hard to have a distinct writing style that it interfered with the storytelling."
5,Survivor of Violence,"Brad Land's Goat is a book about violence and one man's response to it. First, Land was savagely beaten by two car thieves and then later he was subjected to a mindlessly violent hazing ritual at a fraternity.Land, to his credit, refused to either break down following his ordeals or to claim victimhood. Instead he wrote this book about how the violence of the thieves is outlawed while the violence of the fraternity is legally and socially sanctioned even though it is the same kind of violence.Goat is a thought provoking book that deserves a wide audience."
5,A Clemson alumni,"I thought this was a wonderful, though haunting book. I was a fraternity member at Clemson around the time of this story. The facts are not hard to believe, but that is not what this story is about. Land's description of the years right after high school speaks to anyone who has had trouble figuring out their own darkness. His writing is engaging, his story is interesting, and I think this book is certainly worth reading - it is about far more than ""fraternities""."
1,Dont Bother,Terrible book. End of story. He can't write and the story was not very believable or interesting.
4,"Heartbreaking and, perhaps, inevitable","Goat is the story of a college Junior who, kidnapped, terrorized and humiliated a year and a half before, is now faced with the daunting prospect of pledging a fraternity in order to feel a part of the lives of others. Written as a memoir, it reads more like a novel, and provides an interesting perspective on what it means to feel like an outcast, a victim, in a community to which you're supposed to belong, a community of ""brothers"" whose souls are as lifeless as the debris the protagonist collects to prove he exists. Touching, if chilling, and steadfastly non-redeptive."
5,Best anime series EVER,I was so excited to see all of these episodes! I am not the emotional type but this anime series made me feel so much for each of the people in the story! This was the best use of my money ever! I think everyone should watch Sekirei!!! I hope they make a third season!!!!!
3,Better Pace and More Compelling,"Hopefully you have seen season one and know what to expect from this series. You get more of the same with the over the top fan service, bulging bust lines and short skirts. However this time around we get more fights more story and more tension. Now that our hero has assembled quite the harem, you would expect for him to be less and less concerned with teams from opposing Ashikabis, however that's not quite the case. When it suits the story, previously nearly all powerful single digit Sekireis become quite vulnerable and limited in power. It is a tad annoying and disconcerting but the story doesn't stay ""down"" for long. There is one fluff episode full of fanservice and humor which is not to say it is all business otherwise but definitely more focused then the first season."
5,Waited forever for this,For those that have not read the manga (myself included) I thought the story line was a good continuation from season 1.I watched season 1 on Netflix and I am waiting for season one to be released in blu ray format.I dont know why but I thought some of the characters were animated a little bit different from season 1 not sure if it was because I watched the blu ray discs.Hopefully season 3 wont be a long wait.
5,Better than Season 1,"Just finished watching the 2nd season over the weekend and was super impressed with it on Blu-ray, looked really amazing. The story i think continues to improve as the episodes move forward. Minato is slowly growing up and realizing how important his relationship with each of his Sekirei is, and that they all have things to offer him and he them. The fan service is almost stepped up a notch (Kazehana) but the story and characters make this an excellent series in my opinion. The OVA is really funny also with 2 short tales. Poor Benetsubasa.....Hahane is a great foil for her."
5,Great 2nd season,"Skirei is better than the typical harem anime. It's got great action, character development, and plenty of laughs. This season picks up where the 1st left off. After the fight on the bridge. Even though the competition is thinning the danger isn't. MBI has it's eyes watching Minato and his Sekirei's 24/7. Minato also gains more Sekirei's in season 2. The end of season 2 is as climactic as the 1st, and leaves plenty of room for more to come.The animation in this series is top notch, as is the voice acting and music. If you like season 1 this season is awesome too. I accidentally bought and watched this one first, and I was able to follow it pretty well. You will enjoy it more watching it the proper way though. I recommend Sekirei to any mature anime fan. It's a lot of fun."
5,Bufa without being buffoonish,"Excellent recording for a newcomer! If you can only have one Barber I'd reccomend this one unless you're a history (opera) buff, in which case you probably can't just have one anyways! Alva and Berganza do a fantastic job (Bartoli who?) and Prey lives up to his reputation as the best Figaro ever recorded."
3,Male leads don't live up to Berganza,"Teresa Berganza sounds amazing here, as do the orchestra and chorus. However, Prey and Alva as Figaro and the Count were a disappointment as they labored through the difficult coloratura passages that make this opera so much fun. I have heard that the ""standards"" back then were not as high as now, but then that wouldn't explain why Berganza is so terrific. The sound quality is surprisingly good considering the recording's age."
5,Great Bracelet,I love it! I think I've worn it every day since I got it! And it stood up to my 1 1/2 year old niece playing with it!
4,If you only want One BTO CD,This is a very good collection of their hits. The remastered sound is a revilation in itself. It's very crisp and clear allowing you to fully enjoy the songs. Also BTO is great driving music. Cruising long distances are no problem with songs like these. Pop the CD in the player and Roll Down The Highway.
3,its okay,the remastering is not that good and some of the song have a harshness to them however it does bring back memories
4,B.T.O.,"What can I say,classic Rock'n Roll They played GreatStuff. Ther're still out there and want to see them!! Hope they come to Boston!!!"
3,Since when is Rock N Roll responsible???,"I've read the first review of the BTO collection and I have to ask the reviewer a question. How is a musical group from the '70's supposed to know of a disease that will hit ten years in the future?? Rock n Roll isn't about being responsible, it's about commentating on the here and now you idiot. And the lyrics to ""You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet"" are great and catchy. Sure, it now seems a bit immature and contrived, but that's '70's rock in a nutshell. I can see you not liking the album but your reason puts you head so far up your *** that it's amazing you were able to hear it at all!!"
2,Very AVerage,Catchy Material For The 70's But Very Dated Sounding Now.Takin'Care Of Business is One Of the Most Over-Played songs ever.They Sound Like A Backing Band for Bob Seger.
2,Dispensable but vapid.,"Take a loud guitar and some passable playing, add an unattractive singer (notice that the group is never on the album covers) and some truly disgusting lyrics (""Now I'm feeling better, 'cause I found out for sure ... she took me to a doctor, Baby, and he told me of a cure. He said that 'Any love is good love, so I took what I could get ...'""), and you have BTO's formula. Not exactly ready for prime time in the Age of AIDS (nor even good fare for you, Dear Listener.) Avoid this junk."
3,defective blade,looks to be a high quality blade but the one i received was warped i would've exchanged it but it was sold out. amazon was great when it came to refunding my money.
2,inefficient,"Bought this from walmart to heat our living room. After putting it to use for more than 5 hours, we still had to use blankets - this heater does a squat in heating up medium to large rooms.Returning this and try to go for a oil filed heater."
3,Fairly decent heater,"This heater seems to be a good choice to take a ""chill"" out of a room, rather than totally depending on it solely to heat up a large space. I worked on my car a number of times in the winter, and depended on this heater to keep me from freezing...given that my garage was 400 square feet and uninsulated...this heater did surprisingly well enough to get through my winter car repair projects...I had this heater cranked up to the max to get by...while the outside temp was in the mid 20s to 30 deg. Again, to recap...this heater is a decent performer as long as you do not expect it to be your only source of heat, especially for a larger space."
4,Good Dictionary for Kids,"This is good for older kids not yet ready for the big, adult dictionary. (Probably there are fourth and fifth graders who can deal with this, but it would serve the average reader well through Junior High).Although you won't find etymologies anywhere, some might prefer their kids to see these uncomplicated entries that consist of pronunciation and definitions, with the rare sentence example. There are barely adequate little illustrations, and not always close to the definitions and words they illustrate.All-in-all, a fine kids' dictionary that could use improvement."
4,The story of how one man's fanatcism ruined lives,"This is a very well researched account of how one man's dissatisfaction with his life and the influence of the Posse Comitatus resulted in the deaths by torture of a five year old child and a gentle, easily influenced man. The way that Mike Ryan was able to use those disenfranchised by the farm crisis to join him in his paranoid fantasy and live according to his rules is a study in abnormal psychology. As someone who came in contact with this group who lived by stealing from isolated farmsteads while purportedly carrying out God's will, I still find it a frightening story of how many ways religion can be twisted into evil deeds.I lost my copy of this book because a friend from California couldn't put it down before he had to leave!"
2,I question his facts.,"The title of this book has the word TRUE in its title. I fully expected the title to be a true account, and for the most part I think it is. But on page 187 of this book it is written: ""Unfortunately, support from his family and friends was beginning to dwindle."" Unfortunately, that was a statement that was so far from the truth. That was a statement that was never checked out nor confirmed by Mr. Colvin. That was a statement that could make people who know Lester's family, question the validity of the whole book. I wonder just why he would make a statement unless this was a book of fiction?"
4,"Freedom Call, but with less vocal power","For their second album, Freedom Call decided to let the choir drive most of their songs. I found this disappointing given the raw power of their first album, ""Stairway to Fairyland"". This does, however, put more focus on the guitar playing, which is epic power metal at its finest. Still a very solid offering from FC and typical of their style of heroic sounding metal; just don't expect it to continue in the same vein as their first album.You can find my full review of the album here: [...]"
1,Kurtis Blow is lame,"This guy can't rap for beans, The breaks is so stupid its not even funny, Plus he sounds like one of the Muppets."
4,REALTIME RAPS IN THE NEW MILLINEIUM,"THE ALBUM IS HOT. IT BROUGHT BACK A LOT OF GOOD MEMORIES. IT MAKES ME LAUGH WHEN I REMEMBER THE DANCES WE DID IN THE CLUBS I MISS THAT KINDA MUSIC,THOSE GOOD DAYS."
3,You had to have been there for this,"Since Kurtis Blow's vocal talents were considerably limited, this CD will appeal primarily to people who, like myself, were teenagers at the time who grooved to this the first time around. ""Throughout Your Years"" sounded great when I was 15, but the Bullwinkle-style delivery makes it sound unbearably corny today. One listen to this makes it clear why Run-DMC were more successful with their version of ""Hard Times."" Fortunately, the full-length version of ""Christmas Rappin'"" (arguably his best record) and the second-runner up ""The Breaks"" is here. Both of these tunes are/were a lot of fun, but as for the rest-you've been warned!"
2,where is my CD Olivers-shop?,"I believe this will be a great album if it ever gets to my house. I ordered this over three weeks ago. My amazon account says it has shipped, however I don't have it. Placed order through Amazon to Olivers Shop...sent Olivers shop where are you notice, no return...be aware Ron your album is wanted but your distributiuon is lacking."
3,Ehh,"They are cute and they look great in your car. However, they get REALLY dirty really fast and its impossible to clean them. Hello Kitty wasn't white anymore, she was gray :("
2,Elton John collectors only!,"I am an Elton freak and so I love having this collection; however, if you are looking for great covers....keep looking. I will say, that ""Spirit in the Sky"" is an amusing version. If you want an album that is more indicative of why people knew he would be great, check out ""Empty Sky"". Sorry Elton; I love you. Your latest (with Leon) is the best!"
3,"Great mic stand in theory, but breaks too easily","I bought this mic stand and loved it at first. Now I just like it. It is lightweight and the easy adjust for height is great. I also liked the flash base to be able to quickly collapse the umbrella legs at the bottom either during performance or during transport. But after only 3 shows, the flash base is broken and I can not collapse the legs down. Which really makes it a [...] to transport. And its not like I'm knocking the thing around, this happened with just nominal rock and roll use. Sure, the thing is under warranty, but since I can't collapse the legs down to fit it back in the original box to send back to the company, I would have to buy a bigger box, pack it and that would cost more to ship. So I have to weigh out if it is worth spending 25 bucks to ship back a mic stand that I paid 50 for. I will be using it as is until I have enough extra money to buy a new one. But buyer beware."
5,Great dog treats! 7 POUNDS!!! YUM! :D,These treats are awesome little hard Milkbones!! A 7 pound box lasts a long time!! Wonderful product! My dogs love these treats! The different flavors are always nice! My dogs love all the flavors! Thanks for a great product!
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"BEWARE! The item is NOT as pictured. I received a box of the standard beef, chicken, sausage, bacon, etc flavors which is NOT what I wanted at all. So be careful! This item is NOT returnable.UPDATE: The picture of the box has changed. It now corresponds with what was sent. The previous, incorrect picture listed the flavors as: Vegetable, Peanut butter, bacon, beef, and chicken."
5,Great Value,I've just ordered this for the 2nd time. It's a good value and my dog loves them. I just have to try and not feed her so many.
5,Brings it all together,"Outstanding work, far reaching and insightful. I've read a lot of books on meditation and this one shares a place at the top.Interesting combination of biology and physics that I have not witnessed before. Must have an open mind reading this book."
3,"I'm a big fan of punk remakes, but....","My roommate ordered this cd and I stole it from him to listen to it because I like remakes, but I was dissappointed. This cd lacks mojo. The songs seemed to be just thrown together for this cd....they lack character and most of the bands just slug through power chord rendetions of the original tunes. Saving songs: Bracket- My Boyfriends back, Good Riddance- Leader of the Pack, and the Grieving Eucalyptus song Bee-Bop-a- Lula has a really nice opening riff.I advise to borrow this cd from a friend, don't waste your cash. Go pick up the Before you were Punk 1&2 instead."
3,Good bargin.,"I don't like all the songs but there few albums recorded that I do like all . It's like pizza, you might like what I don't and vice versa. I think reviewing music is useless, it's to one's individual tastes, so don't go by this and buy what you think you'll like. This of course will be my last music review."
1,oldies but goodies should be oldie but badies,"should be described as various terrible, not original artist. this was the worst so called music i have listened to in 56 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Poor Taste,"This was a gift and the recipient disliked the product. Basically, a waste of money, as the 5 remaining cartons were never opened."
1,YUK,don't waste your money this tastes awful I thought it would be a good quick meal to take to work but it has this werid taste and its rubber texture is gross...I can't beleive I paid $12.00 for this
1,Feed It To Prisoners,"Never again will I assault my mouth with a product from this company. I'd rather eat a box of fermented jockstraps. Maybe that's going a little far, but this... filth isn't fit to feed to my dogs. I think that the federal and state governments need to buy this wholesale and feed it to prisoners. You want reformed inmates? Make them eat this and the US's prisons will be empty.1.) Empty noodles into the box.2.) Gag.3.) Separate noodles with a fork.4.) Pour sauce over noodles.5.) Gag.6.) Heat for 2 minutes.7.) Stir concoction, gag, take a bite, spit it out, swallow your pride, and throw it away.8.) Eat something else.""What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?"" That it tasted terrible. Specifics: the noodles were rubbery, yet tore like parchment, and that the sauce was made from the condensed secretions of dung beetles and slugs."
1,"taste is bad, noodles were all stuck together","The instructions for this meal indicate you should empty the noodles into the box, and break them apart with a fork. I did that. Then it tells you to add the sauce (this doesn't taste anything like teriyaki sauce), and microwave it for 2 minutes.I followed the instructions, and when I opened the box, I got a clumped up noodle meal with poor taste. I threw half of it away. Out of all the microwave and frozen meals I eat, this one rates as one of my lowest."
3,Great Collection of Steve Martin Movies,"The idea was really good....all three of the movies were good inthe theater. However,when I recevied the DVDs, Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid was defective. This is the only reason for the 3-star rating. Had to return the collection. However, could not be more pleased with Amazon's return policy...they were very prompt; I had no trouble at all. Have ordered many items from Amazon, and will continue to to so."
4,rand mcnally atlas,Excellent atlas. A lot of information. Covers almost anything from population to colleges. Very useful for sales reps and high and college students.
4,Good book for Serious Chemical Engineers,I wish I had this book before I took my CHE Modeling class or CHE Fluids class. It's a pretty good book at a undergrad level. It gives a basic intro to basic Chemical Reaction engineering (CRE). You might want to get Octave Levenspeil's Omnibook as a reference also.
2,"Typos, Typos, Typos...","At about a 5th grade reading level, this book does a decent job in explaining the basics of chemical reaction engineering. Way too many typos in it, however, and that really annoys me..."
5,An Excellent Book on Reaction Engineering,"The beauty of Fogler's book is the numerous real-world problems it contains. It's coverage of RTDs in Chemical Reactors and Catalytic Reactions remain the best I've come across in any chemical engineering textbook. The book is easy to understand yet, challenges the reader into serious thinking on problem solving. It is up-to-date with numerous references to state of the art computer problem solving techniques and programs. Fogler is a must for every student of Reaction Engineering. In combination with Octave Levenspiels book (which is rather theoretical and less real-world and computer-problem-solving oriented compared Fogler) a reaction engineering course would be well grounded."
2,Words of caution . . .,"Make sure to order the most recent printing of the 3rd edition when ordering this book. There are currently 6 printings as of 4/23/03, and there are SUBSTANTIAL differences between the printings!!! (Different questions, rewritten chapters, updated examples, etc.)Also, if you are not familiar with Polymath, you will not understand most of the examples in the book. Fogler relies very heavily on this program. While it is not a bad program, there are some quirks that make it difficult to use.Fogler has an odd sense of humor, and has a number of cheesy references (if you didn't know that he taught at the University of Michigan, you will be well aware of it by the time you are done with this book!). He tries really hard to relate to students, but it comes off as being really corny.PROS: Well-organized tables/flow charts to help with problem-solving.CONS: Over-reliant on Polymath, confusing examples, chapters ""skip"" between topics"
2,Not for me.,"Let me first say that I have a lot of respect for this guy. I can see that a lot of people love his music, and he does have some truly unique and neat music, but I guess this album's not for me. I'm not finding the beauty, which is pretty disappointing for me. I'll give it another shot another day, but I'm really not liking this too much. Something about his sound doesn't appeal to me.Again, I do have tons of respect for this artist, as Animal Collective are brilliant, but this just isn't for me."
3,"Great album, horribly packaged for shipping","Shipped in flimsy packaging. Upper right hand coner was bent. Everything else was in perfect condition, and the album itself is spectacular, but I do not intend upon ever buying from this seller again."
1,Panda Bear V. The ghost of Robert Palmer,"Panda Bear:This administration has got some nerve--Robert Palmer: You're lights are on but you're not home.Panda Bear:Hey who said that I was about to lay into my analysis of this country's impending cultural decay.Robert Palmer: You see the signs but you can't read.Panda Bear: Oh how lame, you're singing in key.Robert Palmer:You know you're gonna have to face it your addicted to love.Panda Bear: You call that artfully obtuse, you sound like my dad imitating Bryan Ferry.(Robert Palmer takes the form of a panther and lunges at Panda Bear)"
1,Makes me hate pandas,"Uuuugghhh this album is terrible. When will you hipsters stop listening to such awful garbage? Each time I think you've found the weirdest, stupidest and most obscure nonsense to obsess over, you find something even worse. How anyone can listen to these boring, whiny, wannabe Beach Boy songs for one minute, not to mention 12+ is truly mind-blowing."
1,Total GARBAGE,"AND I DON'T MEAN THE GROUP GARBAGE! If you want a detailed review, go somewhere else. I heard one song on this CD, ""Take Pills"", on internet radio. I liked it enough to take a chance on the entire CD hoping the other tracks would be as good, or nearly as good as ""Take Pills"". So, I got my delivery from Amazon at work and popped it in my computer for a listen. EVERY SONG BUT ""TAKE PILLS"" WERE GARBAGE. I learned an expensive lesson I should have learned long ago: Never buy a CD based on ONE song. Garbage like this is why people download music illegally. $13 bucks down the drain!"
4,'Person Pitch' by Panda Bear,"'Person Pitch' lays down sonic planes a mite distanced from its verbal units: either could change a bit, the other has already consented. This in comparison to 'Sung Tongs' and 'Feels,' where on tracks with verbal presence these parts are one through distention. (Yorke ran into a similar problem when his 'Eraser' was compared to other Radiohead stuff.) The first exception on 'PP' is the lead track 'Comfy in Nautica,' where the sonic is sparse enough to keep from planing, and so dovetails in flight with Panda's voice. His vocals deserve a dove's tail for the entire album."
5,one of the best albums ive ever heard,im a huge animal collective fan and when i seen that noah lennox had a solo album i bought it without hesitation this album blew me away a perfect album genius production its like brian eno and the beach boys made an album together and i mean come on do you get any better than that one of the greatest albums of all time
5,Panda Bear is in the building!,I got person pitch today in the mail. Its a fantastic album by Panda Bear. Never ceases to amaze me at how insane his music can get and yet give you a feeling of peace and comfort. To know that minds are working like his and the other collective out there gives me hope for humanity to know that our creativity isn't confined to the newest radio hit by artists that don't even write their own music and were put in the music business just to look good and make money. This album like Young Prayer is wildly entertaining and constantly changing. It feels like I'm in a ZOO! :)
3,Unusual practices,"I saw another reviewer's comments about being bumped up to a two year contract on purchasing a one year contract. I called up verizon before purchasing to make sure that they honor amazon's 1 year contracts. On getting an assurance, I purchased this plan and found out that I was also credited for a two year contract.After a few phone calls, this was finally corrected, but just be prepared on wasting time being on hold and transferred.I'm hoping the coverage lives up to its reputation even though it's one of the rare plans to charge for roaming."
2,don't let 'em getcha,I have been a customer of verizon for over 5 years and the only reason I have stayed with them is I get service everywhere and I dont use alot of min. or any of the addon features. They have many hidden or misrepresented charges and practices. You are charged airtime min. to check your voicemail and for their crappy VCAST service too above and beyond the $15 a/mo. just to access VCAST. They deactivate parts of their phones so they dont have the same features as their Cingular/Sprint/T-Mobile counterparts. And their customer services... SUCKS! be prepared to get it coming and going.
2,roaming?,"Seriously, who charges for roaming these days??? 69 cents per minute roaming? Please. For that alone I'll never go with Verizon."
2,Volume 2 is better,This album is good. But I was more familiar with the songs on Volume 2. I much prefer it!
2,Review of Pure Funk,"As a white Boomer of 51, some of these songs were very familiar to me. But most of the artists were 'one hit wonders.' This is why I ordered the compliation. The one song I really liked was ""Kung Fu Fighting."" Remarkable that the lyrics in ""Shaft"" were so very limited. The movie was much better."
4,Fun!,"This CD is the original artists bringing their soulful, funky sounds to life once more. There are a couple lesser known or lame songs, but the majority of music is a lot of fun and gets you dancing."
5,What you're looking for,"Quench the craving for good 70's funk...but hey, I called it disco back then. :-)These are the real artists, not recopies of them. Various artists=the sound you are looking for!"
5,Great Family BBQ cd,Great music. Appropriate for kids and old people. The whole family can party to good familiar hits.
5,My son loves it!,This was a present for my 14 year old son. He loves it. He shars my taste in music. You can not go wrong with this one.
4,Omit two songs and this gets five stars.,"Ironically, if this CD did not contain ""Early in the Morning"" and ""Don't Stop the Music"" it would rate five stars, because a good case can be made that the other 18 cuts are the cream of each particular artist's crop, and even the few one-hit wonders are time-capsule relevant to the essence of 70s funk. I bought it because it saves me the trouble of burning my own greatest funk hits CD,and believe me, anyone with even a modest collection from this era probably has the majority of these songs in their CD rack already.This CD is also a perfect introduction to 70s funk for younger persons who are just discovering the joy of tearing the roof off the sucka. My 15 month old daughter can attest to the fact there's just no way to not dance to this stuff. Word up!"
3,very good not the best recording value,this cd is great...the recording value is not the best but it contains great music
4,Great Forgotten Music,"I bought it For Clarence Carter's, Strok'n, but there are many more great songs that I haven't heard in a long time. Great dance music."
1,"Wow, just wow. Awful.","I couldn't make it more than 10 minutes through this movie, ""10 Dead Men."" It's about a man [Brendan Carr] looking for revenge on the two men that almost killed him. The video is shot with a CAMCORDER - NOT Panavision or similar cameras! The film quality is super cheap, and the soundtrack is awful and the actors are college rejects. I couldn't believe it made it on DVD. Like I said, I wasted 10 minutes of my life on this film. RUN, DON'T WALK from this. You will be greatly appreciated."
1,Headache-inducing,I don't know what Previn and Finck were trying to do here. Fortunately I got this out of the library and did not waste money on it. After the first half-dozen or so tracks I took it out of the CD player. It was absolutely grating - dissonant and cacophonous.
2,SHORT STORY... NOT A BOOK!,"Giovanni's LightI was so disappointed with this Phyllis Theroux book as I'd read her memoir excerpts and enjoyed it so much! It was like a magazine article or short story as the characters weren't developed in full and the story itself was so predictable. Couldn't believe it was offered in digital form for the exorbitant price of $13.99! The book was 2% over before starting the first chapter. Very, very disappointing. When I buy a book I want to read a book, not a short story."
3,An old one,"A good supplement to another program focusing on hearing and speaking the language, this book does offer some valuable lessons. However, it teaches an old way of speaking that most people don't use anymore."
4,I thought it to be good,"If you like books with good attorney drama you'll like this one. Jake is a good character, split between his wife and Mrs. Daren, it gets more complicated by his employer. Sage is a good opponent. The Daren family, the spoiled brat Chip and his sister Gussie add to the plot. If you like Grisham you'll like this. I recommend it. It's not overpowering, but a solid 4 star book."
1,Misleading,"I didn't feel that this was a bad book - It wsn't Coughlin's best, but...The jacket and the review keep talking about an afair between lawyer Jake Martin and client (about to be wealthy) widow. They never as much as kissed, or discussed a relationsip, or went out together. There was absolutely no personal relationship. It was surely put on the book jacket to make one feel that there will be exciting sexual tension and moral delemas - but I waited and waited for that plot twist and it never started. It was completely fraudulant and an absolute lie on the book cover and I'm seeing it in one of your synopsyses. I never vote for more Governmant regulation - but, out and out lying to sell a book - you should be ashamed."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"The maps that come with this unit are wortless. If you want good maps, be prepared to shell out $100. My biggest gripe is that my GPS WILL NOT talk to my computer! That makes it IMPOSSIBLE to load my $100 maps. I tried to connect to both of my PCs at home AND my PC at work. All came up with the same message - USB Device Not Recognized. My friend in Utah has the same problem - and a bad temper. He threw his Garmin against the wall and killed it. He bought a Magellan and is very happy with it.I would have rated it ZERO stars if the option had been available. I will NEVER buy anything from Garmin again!I've contacted Garmin NUMEROUS times and they are no help at all - and have completely ignored me for the past month or so."
2,Not effective for me,"This actually made my acne worse. When I switched from Cetaphil to this product, I went from very light acne to moderate acne. Cetaphil was actually better for me."
2,Not that great,"In my experience, Nivea is one of the best products for skin care. However, I was greatly disappointed after trying this wash. My main complaint is that it dried out my skin terribly. Maybe my skin is too sensitive, but it took a few days to recover from the redness caused by the wash. It made my skin blotchy and irritated. Other face washes seem to be more gentle, even ones with medication in them. However, the smell is pleasant. Bottom line: I won't be buying this product again."
3,"is a good face, I don't think is better then most","It's good, it does not dry your skin and cleans pretty good. I'm not a person who uses alot of facial creams or anything but in my opinion it works.good price"
4,Good stuff,This is a cheap but effective product. I have oily skin but the Nivea Face Wash put it under control without over-drying my face.
3,Just started using these,"When I opened the box these came in, it looked as if 10 gorillas had packaged them! They were all over the box in a busted package with no spindle and some were CRACKED. I called Amazon and true to their wonderful reputation, they made it right for me."
2,Toss and Ship,I thought I was the only one. I purchased 300 of these and I ended up with a big box of scratched up cds. I had to laugh when I opened the box. All 3 packs of cds had exploded from their wrapping. They had no spindles and the plastic wrap on my candy bar is more sturdy. Shameful. I did write and fuss and received a refund. I tossed the entire box. Just some truly shameful shipping.
1,I can't believe it's Amazon.com,"I received my cd's and they were packed so badly that half of them were cracked and the other half were scratched. The next week, I received an email with an apology about my order (I didn't even have to complain.) I received a second shipment and it was packed just as bad as the first shipment. I should have believed the other reviews, but I had to see for myself. MY ADVICE TO YOU IS: DON'T BUY THESE UNTIL THEY IMPROVE THEIR PACKAGING. What a mess!"
3,Good not great,Got the CDs but the plastic was broken and they were all over the box. No bad disc so far at 50%.
1,WTF?!?!?!,"My CDs came, not on a spindle as expected, but thrown into a box!!!! Many of the CDs were scratched by other CDs, on the data side, and I had to throw them away!! This was deplorable packaging!Amazon should really do somethign about this. Amazon should not let this company sell any of their wares on the Amazon.com if they are going to rip people off for shipping $ and then completely mishandle the product! I am P I S S E D _ O F F!!!!!"
1,packaging beyond bad,"these 100 discs were thrown into a box that was two feet long by a foot wide and six inches deep. you could fit 1000 in there, so they rattled around, got scratched, AND 4 were sticking out through the tape when they arrived-- and this is not available for free super saver shipping! I paid almost 9 bucks for MIS-handling!"
1,The CD Packing was awfull.There was no case,"Hi,I bought this item from amazon about 1 months back.The delivery came to me in a Big box and when I opened it, I strangely found that there were no case for the CD's. The Cd's were lying all over the place and probably during shipping it would have got collided with each other. I have never seen anything like this in my life.Such a poor delivery, no case and lot of CD's do not work. I will strongly advice you guys not to take this.ThanksHappy Shopping"
2,Whats up,this product came quick but all the cds were all over the place as if they were all just stuck in the box and packed some were damaged and some were broken so i lost about 10 CDs due to their careless packaging...i thought they were shipping the CDs in a case but i was wrong...i think it would be better to buy CDs from a store instead
1,Beware! Send your business elsewhere! X-Treme Scooters are X-tremely BAD,"Check the Better Business Bureau for further complaints. ZERO STARS, ***THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS***We did only after falling for these thieves. The x-360 was delivered with both a broken storage compartment and a faulty electric charger. The plastic storage compartment COULD have been caused in shipping, but doubtful by looking at the box. BUT reference the charger, X-treme ""customer service"" and ""tech support"" are a joke. Be prepared for ringing phones, unanswered email and poor warranty definitions. Their warranty is a joke, don't bother upgrading if you do buy them, but my advice is to STAY AWAY. They like your money and not your business. I now have an almost $300 paper weight. Merry Christmas son!"
3,Not really worth it,"Kendall presents here what is basically a common-sense introduction to the use of Strong's Concordance. Look up the word in the Concordance, get the word's number, look it up in the dictionary. Pretty simple, really. Unfortunately, though, he acts as if the root of a word is the same as the definition; this is not quite true. Getting the root does help with a deeper understanding, but it's not the ""true"" definition of the word. A few of the examples (ref. John 1:1) are also flawed, as he throws in his own explanation (along the lines ""but of course that's not what it means because of X""). The coupons in the back are a nice value, though.If you've never done even the most cursory etymology, this book might be useful for about five minutes. Otherwise, it might not be worth your money."
1,not a workout,"Although these are ok pilates moves, this is not a challenging workout. I don't think this offers anything over standard pilates DVDs and is a bit slower than the ones I already own."
2,Overall disappointment,"Considering the calibre of the writers from whom Marilyn Sewell requested memories, the low quality of both the writing and ""storytelling"" in this book is abysmal. Most of the memories had little substance, and the tone of many essays was so poor that I had the impression the authors had scribbled them on cocktail napkins in a rush.With few exceptions (Thomas Merton's section, for example), the recollections were boring and lacked any sort of bite. Neither humorous, nostalgic, nor thought-provoking, the tales would leave one constantly turning the pages, hoping some substance would follow. The quest for the Holy Grail would be less futile than that for any wit or charm in this book.The promise of the title undoubtedly would prompt people to order this book as a gift for a Catholic friend or a hope of memories for oneself. I strongly suggest that potential readers at least take a glimpse at a copy on a library shelf first."
4,A Twenty First Centry CD,"Open Source Music captures the essence of musical expression. It meets all needs for music lovers. With its combination of dance, hip-hop, lounge, jazz music, Walking on Pennsylvania Avenue is truly inclusive cd - satisfing all the wants and needs a listener could ask for.For the first time, I've heard music that combines a 21st Century orchestra that pleases the Generation ""X""ers & ""Y""ers. Absolutely a MUST HAVE!"
4,Walking on a cloud,"It's not difficult to understand why this album is being talked about so much. With a diverse lineup of artists, Walking on Pennsylvania Avenue is an eclectic collection of fresh beats, perfect for just chilling out or dancing the night away."
2,Unfortunate CD,"I can understand how folks can find this cd interesting - IF you are one of the artists. I listened to this & while it has potential - it is noticable that it is a CD which was produced by a bunch of amatures. Much to their credit, it is a good starting point - I just found it not too worth wild. Turn on an AM station - you'll get the same affect."
1,NOT GOOD!!!,"this game was so [dumb]. it has no damage meter. heck, i beat it the 2nd day after i got it! DONT BOTHER WASTING 13 BUCKS. KEEP IT AND BY SOMETHING USEFUL!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Tastes great if you figure out how to brew it,"Like the other reviewer, I did not receive any instructions or recipes with my order. I read some other recipes though and I think I figured it out. For anyone who needs to know, it seems to work best if you boil about 2 quarts of water and drop one tea bag in, and continue boiling for about 10 minutes until the tea is a dark green/brown, very strong looking. Remove from heat and let stand. Add about 3/4 cup sugar while still hot and stir in. Let cool, add water until youre back to 2 quarts. Now add more sugar until it tastes medium sweet. The condensed milk or half-half. will sweeten it more when served. Serve over ice and slowly add a some evaporated/condensed milk so it sits on top. Half-half works too, but use less.-Sean L"
3,A little disappointing,"Contrary to the description given for this thai tea, the company DOES NOT send instructions or recipes for this product. Although the tea might have the potential to be good, I do not have the instructions to brew it correctly. I'm still experimenting but wish I didn't have to."
2,random observations about kayaking,"This is a collection of suggestions rather than a systematic discussion, not worth the money or time."
2,Agitation Free - 'The Other Sides Of ...' (Garden Of Delights) 2 1/2 stars,"Apparently, this ten track CD was recorded just before Agitation Free disbanded in the fall of 1974. Looking at a list of about a dozen musicians on the back cover, the only two that I recognized were bassist Michael Gunter and guitarist Gustav Lutjens. This is NOTHING like the other Agitation Free CD's. Turns out to be decent quality 'progressive jazz', something that most of our parents might like. Notable tracks are ""6th Floor"", ""Latino Catherine"" and the well written ""Offstage"". As with most of Garden Of Delights releases, 'The Other Side...' comes with a nifty 36-page CD booklet with rare band photos and memorabilia. For completists only."
3,"Easy vegetarian lunch, bit salty","I keep these in a shelf on my desk for an easy hot lunch at work. Following the package directions always turns out right for me. (add water, heat for four minutes)Actually a decent amount of broccoli, but you could make it healthier by adding even more. I know it's a convenience food, but even so, I find it a bit too salty. I'm always thirsty after eating it. But, it's yummy and my other coworkers always ask what I've made because it smells good, too."
3,They call this cheese?,"I didn't think it possible, but the cheese used in this product smells and tastes worse than the processed semi-kinda-sorta-maybe processed cheese used in some lowbrow burger joints. The product actually has potential, but you may want to overlook this one if you want more of a decent cheddar taste."
1,Bad After Taste,This particular food item left a lot to be desired. The powdered cheese left a very bad after taste. I will not be purchasing this item again. The only positive plug I shall give is that the serving size is generous.
1,There Is No Excuse For This Kind of Crap,"I love the sy-fy channel just as much as the next guy, but someone needs to bring an end to their ridiculous ""sy-fy original movies."" I came across ""Dinoshark"" on the sy-fy channel and allowed it to play while I sat on the couch and did some work on my laptop. I expected little from ""Dinoshark"" other than some mindless entertainment, but I was truly unprepared for just how craptacular it really was.Do the people who make these cheap movies put ANY thought into them at all? Understandably, budgets are tight for this kind of film-making, but that's no excuse for the unbelievable horrendous dialogue in this movie, the absurd parallels to ""Jaws,"" the stupid special effects that don't make any sense in a logical world bound by the laws of physics, or the just plain overall bad movie-making.Avoid ""Dinoshark"" at all costs. It WILL make a victim of you!"
3,Solid monster movie,"Dinoshark had nothing ""big"" in terms of quality either way, although there were small things I enjoyed. The characters get considerably more focus than the Sharktopus cast, the attacks are more ambitious than most Syfy films while showing some restaint from reaching ridiculous levels like Sharktopus, Corman acting in his film demonstrated he's still enthusiastic about filmmaking after all this time and hopefully will produce many more monster filmsDinoshark has much more replayability than Sharktopus actually, it's pretty fun while not getting over-the-top. Sharktopus meanwhile has more spectacle but once you've seen that there's not much motivation to watch it again."
4,Without a Trace,"As BIG shark movies (of a prehistoric nature) go, this was pretty standard. I don't fault it for that. I went by the endorsement: Roger Corman Presents, and snapped it up. Roger has a good sense when it comes to cheese. He is, unfortunately, a terrible actor and should have taken a cue from Hitchcock: don't speak, just occasionally wander through.I love monsters with enormous appetites and/or a bottomless pit for a stomach. I immediately lost track of the number of folks it chewed up. How they all fit in there I'll never know!Of course, there was a dopey cop, there always is, that, and a doomed sidekick, plus a damsel under dressed. It was pretty much what one could hope for in a movie of this type. Another keeper!"
3,Dinoshark,It's a different twist on Shark Movies and can't beat the amazon rental price. Just make sure you have a nice dowload ability as 4mbs is barely doable as I had to endure.
5,The Defintive Book for Analytical Chemistry,This book is the definitive guide for anyone who is taking a course in Analytical Chemistry or just wants to learn about Analytical Chemistry. The language and examples are straight-forward and very easy to understand and format is easy and progressive without being intimidating to anyone who may find chemistry to be a difficult subject to understand.
2,Not enough volume,"I bought these headphones to use with my ipod while I work out and go for walks. I don't want the volume so loud that it blows my eardrums out but I want enough to hear my music over fitness equipment and average traffic noise. With the volume all the way up, I still had the music drowned out by outside noises. I have other earphones and ear plugs that deliver a higher volume so unless you're using these in a fairly quiet enviroment, these headphone won't deliver.They do fit comfortably on my head and ears but I can't hear my music."
2,Careful when trying it in the car,I couldn't get the cassette to stay in the player in my 2004 Impala.I finally stuck my finger in there and let it run for 15-20 seconds.Be careful.Can't really blame the cassette. Might be that it sucks on certain models of cars or something.
2,Wow,"I was pretty disappointed in this product. When I received it, it was a ""refurbished"" computer - BUT IT STILL HAD FAMILY PHOTOS AND PROGRAMS FROM ITS PREVIOUS OWNER ON IT! Scary thought huh? It also had an issue overheating and randomly shutting down. So...I got a MAC! :)"
1,A complete lemon,"I have had this laptop a little over a year. About three weeks after my warranty ran out, my wireless stopped working. After contacting HP support with no success I received an email from them offering free repair since there is a known problem with this model. Do some googling and you will find forums full of the exact same problem replicated in user after user. Buyer beware."
3,Quite possibly the WORST documentation with a product ever,"The printer itself is decent. Not the greatest, but you get what you pay for, but the documentation from Xerox that comes with this product is HORRIBLE. Completely and TOTALLY useless. Xerox should be ashamed of themselves. It's not for beginners to set it up on a network. I suggest laying aside a lot of time for installation"
4,Good Textbook for the Lazy Professor,"This is a good textbook for an advanced undergraduate class or a graduate seminar--lots of helpful facts, plenty of information to stimulate in-class discussion."
5,More Easy Impossible.....,"As i said in the title...,This is the best automatic feeder, you will love it.., its extremelly easy to set up, just adjust the hour, and done, you can setup 4 times to feed, you can also can adjust the feeder to feed 2 times for every turn (with 1 minute of difference), also it have a ""force"" button, to feed manually, without disturb the programmed times.The compartiment is regulable so you can adjust the amount of food, that will be released in every turn..., its powered by 2AA batteries.I didn't found at the time something bad, or any problems related to the humidity or moisture."
3,Ehiem Auto Feeder,Product is nice but would have been much better if they had also included a method to clamp it down on aquariums with no ledges or light with indentation to set it on. Had item a week and it fell into the tank due to being unstable and now is unreliable due to saltwater getting into system. Item must be kept away from humidity to work best and keep food dry. Could have been thought through a little better for use with more traditional aquariums.
4,Tension and Tears,"The author cleverly describes the passengers on the fatal flight without telling whether they lived or died. This creates suspense and curiosity, pulling the reader along. He includes a good amount of technical and medical information, but manages to make it understandable and interesting--no mean feat. He tells his story from the viewpoints of people involved in the prelude, actuality, and aftermath of the crash. He is wise concerning how much detail to relate about each of these people--except in the case of Robin Fech, the stewardess. He inflates her role, as, apparently, have the media. He also lapses into bathos: we get too many accounts of prayers, tears, and hand-holdings. Nonetheless, the book is a real page-turner. I read it during an airplane journey, and found that it distracted me quite well from flight nerves. Summary: educational and absorbing, if not as moving as the author seems to want."
2,"Not Nearly As Good As ""Crash""","I must admit that I was more than a little disappointed in this book. It is very similar in structure and plot as the 1978 book, Crash, by Rob Elder. That book covered the story behind the 1972 crash of an Eastern Airlines L-1011.If you are interested in this subject matter, I recommend trying to dig up a copy of Crash from a used book store."
5,Read This Book,Want to read about real heroes? Read this book. A powerful account of what most people may consider their worst nightmare. The way ordinary people are capable of extrordinary actions is truly inspiring. Appropriate now more than ever.
3,The Order of the Deep,"I knew the author personally. He told us (my husband and me) many of the stories in the book. Knowing Dr. Barak, I could ""read between the lines"" his fears and anxieties being in the war and witnessing the horrors of it. He always tried to make light of his war experiences, but I knew he had nightmares about a lot of the things he saw and participated in. He was a delightful person and made a huge contribution in his post-war profession. He loved his family and was a really good friend. I may buy his other two books just to see what they revealed about him."
1,This is NOT a book by Berke Breathed!!!,"I've no idea why this ""book"" (5 pages?!) is listed under my name... and what an incredible price. This is a phantom book and I don't want my fans to be confused. Bizarre to say the least."
4,Solid advice with examples,"If you have ever tried to write a complaint letter and did not receive satisfaction or even a recognition of your complaint you know the importance of getting it worded correctly the first time. Now attorney Janet Rubel has put together a collection of the standard complaint letters she uses. To make it even more convenient all the letters are also on the included CD. No matter what your need, if you want to write a complaint letter then you will find one in here that will give you the format that gets results. 101 Complaint Letters that Get Results is a recommended resource for everyone."
4,Pokemon Legendary Birds Promo Card Set,Bought this for my grandson. He can relate better than I can to the purpose of each card. He enjoys putting the cards in some sort of catalog order (which only he understands). He carries his folder of cards with him and interacts with other card holders. Overall he enjoys sharing his collection and trading with other card collectors.
5,Great voice - huge talent.,"Taylor is a great singer whose nac for writing potent love/longing songs makes it difficult to turn away. His sincerity comes across in his lyrics, his creativity comes across in his music, and his passion comes across in his voice. He gives you exactly what he wants you to have - and you love him for it."
1,Too basic,"Useful only for somebody who's never noticed that a speedboat has a different shape than a fishing trawler. I was looking for some more technical, that would be guide to design a powerboat hull, so I'm very disappointed."
1,Only for the beginner,Save your time and money and go by manufacturers pamphlets. You will gain more information that is more accurate and save money too.
1,all about powertboats,If you dont know nothing about....maybe this the book for you.Very basic and superficial.
2,I was not able to obtain the information that I needed.,"I brought this book because I needed to work out if a particular boat with a particular outboard would meet certain performance parameters under certain sea conditions.I was not able to do this with the information in this book.I found ""Propellor Handbook"" by Dave Gerr much more usefull."
5,Kame--my favorite crackers,"I love the Ka-Me seaweed flavored rice crackers. Until now I could only find them when I visited Florida. Now that I can order them on Amazon.com, I will be doing it regularly. As a bonus, they are less expensive ordering them than purchasing them in the grocery store."
2,"Bose in-ear headphones - good sound, poor design","The sound quality of the Bose in-ear headphones (earbuds, actually) is excellent. I use these earbuds with my iPod and find the audio quality far superior to all other earbuds and portable digital media ear/headphones ever owned. That said, I am disappointed with these ""headphones"" for the following reasons: 1) the tips are removable and they come off too easily if caught on anything in your backpack, car, etc., and 2) the cord is very long, which may be good for home audiophiles, but it's excessive for something like an iPod that you may carry in your pocket or backpack. The previous comment about these earbuds being ""high maintenance"" is unfortunately true. Try spending 10 minutes looking on the floor or between the seats in your car for one of these errant tips and you'll get the picture.At close to $100 a pair, it's a lot to pay for good sound wrapped in a flawed package."
4,"Decent sound, but not the best","These are decent headphones for $100 bucks. The sound is a little bass-heavy and a some of the highs and little details are missing. The phones fit a little awkward and don't actually go into the ear canal. The cord is designed well and the gel earpieces feel good once the headphones are in. Considering the popular alternatives like Sony, Shure, and J-Moda, these are a good buy. If you're looking for amazing sound like some of my fellow reviewers claim, better step up to Etymotics, Weston, UE or higher end Shures.Personally, I expected more from Bose and realized that I just bought into the marketing. I returned these headphones and bought UE triple.fi 10, which would not be fair to compare here since 1) They're $400 and 2) They're magnitudes better than Bose headphones in every respect."
1,Don't expect a fast shipment,"I ordered this item for a Christmas present on December 12th with a promise for a December 25th delivery. They just arrived yesterday, January 10th."
2,not that bad,was not happy with them did not live up to the products name boes sold them to a buddy the next day.
3,Thought much better than ipods but isn't,"Kept on switching between ipods earphones and these while listening to different kinds of music, I didn't hear much of a difference. They're better but not alot better to warrant paying $99."
2,Poor Quality and Durability,"I purchased these earbuds about two months ago, thinking that the Bose name would carry with it quality and durability. I was wrong. First, the sound quality, for the price, is nothing special (not very good bass response, and an almost 'tinny' sound). I own a pair of Sony in-ear buds that have better sound quality (they produce a much richer and life-like sound) and bass reflex and were only about 40 dollars. Secondly, after only two months of light use, one earphone just stopped working all together. Now I am stuck with a broken pair of expensive earbuds. Not recommended. Take some time to find a better pair than this for the price."
2,Excellent Sound -- Poor Fit,"The audio quality is second to none with these Bose in-ear headphones. Unfortunately for me, the silicone ear pieces didn't fit well. The small silicone ear piece was too small and the medium too big. I can't use the ear buds that came with my iPod or anything designed like them due to the discomfort I experience after having them in for a short time. I recommend Skullcandy or V-moda for a more comfortable fit. The silicone ear piece is a very flexible flap rather than a solid chunk of silicone. They flex better to fit the ear canal and I can keep either of those in my ears all day and not have any problems."
2,Only good for sound,Yes the TIPS again for a product made by Bose you would think the tips will not fall off so easy and once they fall off it's inpossible to find then.Second they do not cancel out any noise and I live NYC I take the subway everyday. The sound is the best but not loud. If you like bose buy them but ready to spent money buying the tips more then once
4,"Great sound, but eartips sometimes fall off","I like the sound on these headphones (for the price at least!). Unlike most other iPod headphones, these last for more than a few months. Theseear tips fit pretty conformably in your ear and don't fall off much while they're in your ears. The only problem I had is that the rubber ear tips on the earphones don't attach securely, and as such they sometimes fall off, especially when I pull them out of my pocket. I've already lost 4 for various reasons and have had to buy replacement ear tips. Not a huge problem, but it's something Bose could easily fix."
3,Not what I hoped for from BOSE?,"Pros: Bass response, Fit & ComfortCons: High and Mid Range Response.They have descent bass and a comfortable fit. The sound if full and wide. But the highs & mids are fairly flat & kind of muddy sounding? You have various size silicone earpieces to help you get the best fit. These do not go inside your ear canal the silicone tips just rest on the rim of the canal. So if you don't want that ear plug feeling of a pure sound isolation set of phones these are pretty comfortable. So with that they are a noise reducing option phone not a isolation one. They do reduce outside noise allot more than the standard earbuds though. If you are very active (ie: you want to use these for running or jogging) they maynot offer you a secure enough fit. For me they're fine. They sound better than the standard buds but with less highs & mids (a little muffled). I think I'm going to have to spend more $$$ to get something GOOD! :("
2,Bose Tri-Port In-Earphones,"This has to be a product of the BOSE-interns, This is my first time being dissatisfied by BOSE and I own allot of Bose products. Whats wrong with this product is that if you are an active person going to use this at the gym DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT buy this earphones, most of my workout is spend trying to plug back into my ears with the free accessories provided by Bose it still doesn't help just frustrating. The sound quality is great but you wont be able to enjoy the sound as it falls out of your ear.Linked to free accessorieshttps://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_HEADPHONE_SUPPORT_EVENT"
2,NOT designed for gym use or running!,"Love Bose products and really like the customer service. However these earphones are horrible to use for exercising! Once you start sweating, the earphones just come right off! YES, I did try all the pads they send. Unfortunately, there is no way you can wear them and exercise. I would suck it up and buy the Bang and Olufsen earphones (expensive!) or be economical and buy the Vmoda. They both work great."
2,3.5 sound 1 for losing all the ear pieces in a month,"I really wanted to like these... but losing all six of the ear pieces in a month is NOT a ""feature"" one wants to enjoy after dropping a C-note on them.Very Good sound but not great. My 41 year old ear drums appreciated that these were more ""bassy"" than other buds that tend to be too tinny for me to stand for very long.I've had better sound from the Koss behind the neck Active Noise Reduction headphonesKoss QZ50 Stereophone."
2,Poor product design,"After losing the tips repeatedly and untangling the cord each time I use these headphones, I was only pacified by the excellent sound. However they broke after 10 months of regular use last week. Way too much money and hassle. I wouldn't buy them again."
2,Old Bose???,The Bose in-ear headphones I received were either two generation old Bose headphones or are knock-offs. (Bose did little to help me determine which it is.) I know they are not last generation Bose because I had the last generation headphones and these do not look the same in several ways. Also the picture of the item was not correct because the item arrived in a cardboard box and not a see through plastic package.
1,FAKE,"Had these headphones a little over four months and the left ear piece went out. Called Bose to ask if it was covered under warranty and was told that they are counterfit. There is a number under the left silicon earpiece and that number corresponds with all black cables. When they switched to the black and whit cables, they changed numbers. Do not purchase these headphones on amazon, unless you buy directly from amazon."
3,Sometimes I just dangle them in the air and try to get my ear up near them,"The sound quality on these things is very good, of course, so congratulations there, but one does have to wonder if the Bose engineers ever tested them on actual live humans, as there are some serious design issues. First of all, the cords are unusually heavy and have a tendency to entangle themselves in snarls that take mariner-level knot expertise to unravel. Secondly, and more importantly, the ear buds come in three sizes (S, M, L), even the smallest of which are a tight fit for anyone with remotely normal-sized ears. The medium buds are suited only for people with unusually cavernous auditory canals. If the large buds fit you, it might mean that you are Frankenstein."
5,We love this book!,"This is a delightful story with outstanding illustrations. My grandchildren and I still laugh at the story and pictures even after many, many readings. I wish there would be a sequel where they continue with French food. The inside of the hardback's dust jacket is a special treat as well, and the recipes that follow are fun to make with kids. This book is a real winner!"
5,Chicks who love Salsa,"My daughter is 6 years old, and this is one of her favorite books. Some of the key ingredients of the book are:- chickens who are very tired of eating the same feed every day- ducks who are tired of fish- pigs who are tired of slop- a garden without foodThen introduce some spices and salsa, shake and stir, and you have a fiesta of flavors which no animal or human could pass up."
4,Funny book!,"Chicks and Salsa is funny. It is funny because the chick is wearing a big hat. I like it because the rooster was doing a pose that was funny. It is also funny when the pig eats a hot chili pepper and it's ears went up. I like it because the bull was wearing a sombrero and did a really funny dance. It was hilarious when the rooster was laying down and pretending to be dead. In the picture the rooster's eyes were squiggles and I thought that was really, really funny. This was funny because the girl chickens were wearing earrings - everyone of them!Written by a Colorado 3rd Grader - C.L."
3,Very smooth!,I bought this album after a friend recommended it to me when he got back from London. He knows I like world music for practicing my yoga. The problem with this album is that it doesn't really fade into the background like some other new age type songs. I was really looking for something a little less jazzy sounding and lyrics that were more indistinct so it wouldn't distract me from my practice. I can't recommend it for yoga but I enjoy playing it in my car on the morning commute. It helps to keep me from getting too stressed out.
5,Very Mozez!,"One would expect Mozez's solo album to be much like his previous work with Zero 7, as the cover suggests but it's not. It's every bit as good, but the new sound is unique. The music is mellow and smooth but the vocals are more precise and crisp. In short, it's very Mozez."
5,As good as chill music gets!!!,"Smooth groove in the vein of Hed Kandi Winter Chill compilations. If you like chill, it doesnt get better than this!"
2,just couldn't get into it,"After reading all the positive reviews, I purchased a used copy. I gave up on page 13 because there are just too many other really good books out there!"
5,Best Glimpse into Ethiopian Adoption Culture,"I'm writing this as the mother of an adopted Ethiopian child- I bought this book after a random search and it has been the most valuable book of our whole adoption journey. It's loaded with helpful background info on the AIDS & Orphan crises in Ethiopia, history of Ethiopia, insight into the cultural perceptions of adoption (especially by affluent, white Westerners!) and the very moving perspectives of the orphans themselves, and their Ethiopian caretakers. The heroine of this story is very real, and her character development was deep and insightful. I laid the book down several times to have a good laugh (or cry!) but could hardly keep from turning the pages. Whether you are adopting yourself, supporting someone who is, or just interested in learning more about Ethiopia and this heroine's story, I know you will come away inspired."
5,Great book!,This is such a great book. It gives a very detailed look into the lives of children fathers and mothers in Ethiopia Africa as well as the struggles that locals face to care for the children that are left orphaned. It also gives details of the different research done on aids and the theories that scientists have come up with. Great book would buy again! Package was shipped fast and in perfect condition would buy from this seller again!!!
5,"Heartbreaking, powerful & moving","For years, I have thought about adopting a child from Africa, and this book confirmed for me that this is something I will, and need to do in the near future. This book was heartbreaking, heartfelt, and also showed the power of what simple woman with endless love in her heart can do. Haregewoin Teferra is a true angel here on earth - she took in orphans, some of them infected with HIV, in a country where such a disease is stigmatized. She overcame her own personal heartbreak over losing her husband and daughter and transformed that pain into something amazing and beautiful. She is a true inspiration to me. To hear the statistics of poverty and disease in Africa is mind-boggling. It humbles me and makes me want to do more. We should all want to do more."
5,A chance for us all to know the real Christa...,"This book by Robert Hohler is a well-written, very personal look at the life of a very special woman whom most of us only had a chance to know from a distance. From her childhood to the last few days of her life, Christa McAuliffe was constantly giving gifts of love, insight, advice, friendship and understanding to her family, friends, and students, and the last few months of her life to the rest of the world as well. I Touch The Future gives us all a chance to realize what a huge loss we were dealt on January 28, 1996. If only someone would write equally good biographies of the rest of the Challenger astronauts, we could all realize the full extent of this tragedy."
1,OWWW They hurt!,"I wanted to buy some cheap-o headphones to wear at the pool with my old CD player...you know, something that I could have and if they got wet and ruined, I wouldn't be completely devestated. Unfortunately, you can only wear these for about 5 minutes before they hurt your ears. So I bought alternative headphones and put these away. Stupid me, I brought them out when I needed some in a pinch and they actually have been shocking my ears! They are not molded to fit in any ear and they have this nub on the side of each that kill! The sound quality isn't so bad but the fit is. Spend the extra money for comfortable ones. I'd even be so bold as to venture to the Apple store and buy the $20 earbud headphones that come with the iPods. Those things are great!"
1,It should be illegal to sell these.,"I am shocked by how terrible these sound. It reminds me of listening to an AM station on a portable transistor radio, if you're old enough to remember that. I'm surprised Maxell would put their name on these. I won't look at Maxell products the same way again."
1,Garbage,"don't waste money, too bad there is not zero stars. picked up for my kid, she actually took care of them, but they blew out after a week or so"
1,Lacked scholarship,"I differ from most of the other reviewers. I read this book as part of a requirement for a doctoral seminar. I think the book had much potential, but fell short. Dr. Roberts failed to articulate who her audience was intended to be or what she hoped to accomplish. She clearly was biased against whites. Notably, she always capitalized ""black"" but never white or any other race. She uses data, but never frames it in any type of context. Data that cannot be compared is of no value. Further, she did not use good scholarship in some of her statements. Early in the book, she states that Thomas Jefferson and others were racists and footnotes it by referring to what someone else said about Jefferson. In good scholarship, if you want to know what someone thought, you go to the primary source, not what someone else said about what they thought. The book could have been very good, but I couldn't tell where she intended to go, so I will never know if she arrived."
4,"Strong, compelling, repetitive","This book was indeed eye-opening and had a profound affect on me. Still, her initial thesis is simply reinforced and repeated again and again, and this 300 page book could have been 1/3 the length."
5,Excellent book on reproductive health from a woman-of-color perspective!,"Although it is bittersweet (I wish there was no need for a book on this sour subject), I absolutely love this book! Dr. Roberts' thorough analysis of reproductive health as it relates to Black women is outstanding. As a medical and public health professional, I often refer to this book as a resource for various projects and research. I recommend this book to anyone who is entering the field of reproductive health, medicine, or health care. I also met Dr. Roberts and she is truly a gem - sweet, down-to-earth, and very knowledgeable."
5,Great Book,This book was new and It come within one week of purchasing it and it was in great brand new condition
3,Ouch! Earman is Wrong about Hume.,"Earman attributes to Hume the view that ""the probabibility of a miracle is flatly zero."" (p. 23.) This is a serious misreading of Hume. As any undergraduate philosophy student knows, Hume would never say that the probability of ANY matter of experience is ""flatly zero."" Hume's most notorious trait was his epistemic fallibilism, which arose from his skepticism about induction. Sadly, Earman is so bothered by some of Hume's strong anti-miracle language that he fails to view these passages in the context of Hume's most central claims.Before one gets overly taken with Dr. Earman, I would suggest reading Robert Fogelin's ""A Defense of Hume on Miracles"", a short book that demolishes Earman's claims about Hume."
3,"Hat is nice, plastic clips for chin straps are not","I purchased the Yukon Tracks Russian hat two years ago and I like the hat. It's the plastic clips that hold the chin strap together that I don't like. Not because they don't work, but because they BROKE !!IF THIS COMPANY CAN SEND ME A COUPLE OF NEW PLASTIC CLIPS, I WILL WRITE A MUCH BETTER REVIEW FOR THE HAT !!!"
4,One of the best figures Todd Mcfarlane has created!,I purchased this spawn charater about a week ago and i love it. The Samurai Wars Series 19 is now my favorite serie Todd Mcfarlane has created! I have it on display and everyone who comes over think it's the most detailed of the Mcfarlane toys i have. I love it! It's the coolest Mcfarlane Series I'VE Purchased!
4,Cooling is becoming an art in overclocked PC's,"This case cooler is sort of robust, being made out of hard plastic and the ability to tilt the fans in various directions. I liked the idea of being able to tilt the fans, in case you want to suck hot air from your hard drive area, or do you want to point it down and take heat away from a particular I/O card.I could not rate this item at 5 stars due to the fact that I had a difficult time ""aiming"" the fans in the desired direction, as they are a bit limited to where they can point. This may be just in my system, since I have a mini tower and everything inside is crammed.I can imagine in mid to full tower cases, the case cooler would work better."
4,Good case fan.,"I've installed the Antec fan in several systems, and have found it to perform quite well in all instances. The fact that you can direct the fans towards specific components was a bonus, and I installed it next to my (hot) video card to remove waste heat. For the price, this is an excellent componet that will help extend the life of your system."
3,Runs large for a child,Read the reviews prior to purchasing and knew it ran large. Too bad my son looked like a bobble head. Not very comfortable.
4,way better than boppy!,This pillow is so much better than the boppy which I used with my first son. Now with my second son I use the breast friend pillow and love it. Only complait is that it is a pain to fasten and unfasten but it really helps it stay in place which makes it worth the few extra seconds!
5,Necessary item for all brestfeeding moms,"After pain in my neck, back and arms, sweaty baby, sweaty me and frustration, pillows under my arms, under the baby, behind me. Brest friend came along to save us. A baby can lie down on the pillow, it has a special raised pad for his head on both sides to fit perfectly for facing a breast. The material is soft and washable, doesn't shrink in the dryer. A nice pocket fits a diaper, wet wipes and a pacifier. The color of this blue brest friend is light blue, not as bright blue as on the picture here. I liked its actual light blue color. The back pad on the brest friend envelops around my back and it all feels comfy to brestfeed using this product."
2,Same issue as the boppy,"This breastfeeding pillow is nice, but I have the same issues I had with the boppy, I still need to stuff a blanket or pillow to keep it up high enough when I am sitting down. The whole reason I bought it was b/c the description said it would stay up higher. I have not found that to be the case at all and so now I am still stuck stuffing a blanket under it to keep my baby's head at breast height. Had I known I would have just kept my boppy."
5,Love it!,"I have been using the My Brest Friend pillow for three months and I LOVE IT! It is so secure and never slips or slides like the Boppy pillow or traditional pillows do. The cover comes off and can be machine washed, but does have to hang to dry, which is annoying, but still not enough for me to take a star away. MBF is also nice and firm, which I find a big advantage over the Boppy. I cannot recommend this pillow enough-I will be buying it for all of my friends who plan to breast feed!"
4,Color pictured not real to life,"In real life the color of this blue pillow is much lighter and more of a baby powder blue. I haven't tried it out yet but it looks to be very convienent for a mom of more than one because I'll actually be able to stand up while using this pillow. I bought 2, one to keep in the car and one for home. I didn't like the boppy because I felt like baby fell between me and the pillow. Hoping this pillow solves that problem this time around. Bring it to the hospital with you ladies! You'll be glad you did."
5,Gentle Facial Cleansing,"I have been using Avalon Organic Botanicals Lavender skin products for quite a while now and they are wonderful! The Lavender Cleansing Milk is very gentle and smells great! After cleansing with it my skin feels very soft, supple with no dry, itchy, tight feeling. Also, I have never had breakouts with Avalon Organic Lavender products. I also use the Lavender Toner and Moisturizers and very much like being able to use products from the same line for all of my skin needs. And natural!"
1,"nah.,..",too oily... like lotion.... cant get rid of oil in my face.. not recommend this product... get lever 2000 soap much better
5,cleans and smoothes,"I love this clenser; it feels very smooth going on and cleans easily and gently. The lavendar scent is also 'soft"""
4,Love this cleanser,"This is a soap free liquid cleansing milk and on top of that organic. What else not to love? It's gentle enough for my oily skin and it doesn't dry my skin compared to the other facial cleanser I have used in the past, love the lavender smell too. I totally recommend this cleanser to anyone who have a sensitive skin. You'll love it!"
4,No complaints on this one ;),"Clearly I needed a hanging lantern to complete my exterior. See my reviews on these other matching products:Kichler - 11004RZKichler - 11005RZEasy to install, easy to change the lamp, looks good etc. Just too bad it's a little too expensive..."
3,I miss Charlie Bradshaw,"I liked this series as the Charlie Bradshaw series, and I feel it went downhill when Victor Plotz took over as narrator and main character. The author took us from a character (Bradshaw) who had substance and struggled with his life to a cartoonish character (Plotz). The last three books smack a bit of buffoonery. Read the first seven books and enjoy them."
2,Not much you haven't read before,HOUSE CAT: HOW TO KEEP YOUR INDOOR CAT SANE AND SOUND had little new infomation and was a bit on the dull side. I suggest only novice cat owners give it a read.
2,Misleading Title,"I bought this book because of the title. I have 2 indoor cats and hoped this book would have suggestions for activities that would help keep an indoor ""Sane and Sound."" No way. This book contains only generic basic information on how to care for kittens/cats. If you are looking for information strictly about indoor cats, save your money. This book ain't it."
5,House Cat,"This was a very informative, entertaining book that will help us to spoil Lizzie, our very special little four legged friend, even more than before!"
5,Timely gift,Received it before the date and works great. There was no problem or hassle in buying or receiving the product.
1,This product do not fit my vehicle. List provided has a mistake.,"According your ""Find Part that fit your vehicle"", I ordered and received the wrong product for my Grand Cherokee Limited 2000, the Monroe SC 2929 Magnum Steering Dumper, which is not the one that really fit the vehicle. The correct one is the Monroe SC 2962 Magnum Steering Dumper. I got not idea if if possible for you to send me the rigth one."
5,Great book,"Although a quirky title, do not discount for it has a lot of great historical information. A must read if you are a serious about learning more details about why certain pieces of furniture were once used and not now."
3,framed,I like this poster very much but the color seems less intense than pictured on web.You might want to check out framing costs before purchasing posters and/or art prints. I priced three framing places. Two were offering 50% off. The cheapest was $175 for a simple chrome finish strip frame w/ plexiglass which upped the cost of my $30 poster!
1,Warning: these are Stoneware not Corningware Grab It Bowls.,"My old bowls were corningware and indestructible. The only way they could break is if you dropped them on a granite counter or a tile floor. These bowls are stoneware and breakable. They look like the old bowls, but they have a rough bottom. You need to be careful when placing them on a surface that could scratch. You also have to avoid sudden temperature changes. If the stoneware is hot, you cannot add liquid, place it on a wet surface or handle with a wet or cold cloth or they could crack. You did not have to worry about any of this with the corningware bowls. I should have sent them back, but did not want to pay the shipping cost."
3,CorningWare Grab-It's,"Good, but not as good as the originals. You can not use these on the stove top. the old originals I have can be used on the top of the stove. Good for oven or microwave use."
2,Not what I expected,"Many years ago, we bought four Grab-it bowls and they have served us well. They are white, _Pyrex glass_, and were made by Corning here is the USA. These ""new"" Grab-It bowls come from a factory in China and are not made of Pyrex. They are _stoneware_ and as anyone knows stoneware eventually chips and cracks."
5,Very handy to use.,"It is very handy to use anything such as cold cereal, salad, soups, vanilla ice cream with fresh fruits, and many others."
4,Oh.... these are NOT for stove top?,"I heated soup and chili in these on the stove top for four years until I got a microwave. I thought ""It's Corning... must be for stove top too."" I just read reviews and learned they are for IN the oven, not ON. Guess I was lucky that none broke. I bought 4 at different times: two with opaque plastic lids, two with clear. The opaque lids were too darn hard to put on and remove, so I gave them to a thrift shop. I think the plastic lids might not be microwave proof. Minus one star because these handy dishes are not for stove top."
2,Grab-It Dish with Cover,"Have to be careful when microwaving. Lid pops off and creates spills, if left sealed. If not liquids still seap out over the edge and spill."
3,handle gets hot,"This is a nice little dish for warming up small amounts of leftovers and storing them (15 ounces isn't much!), but I find that if you need to heat something up for longer than a couple of minutes or so, the little bitty handle will get hot.The handle is also quite short and stubby, so it's hard to carry the dish around by it...especially if it is full. They probably should have put some ribbing on it or something to make it less slippery, too.One more thing...I must question WHY the lid also covers the handle...? It just makes it more awkward to fit the cover over it."
5,corningware,The items were just what I ordered and the delivery was faster than normal. I am very pleased
4,"Durable, Practical","These bowls are very durable and practical, however, the lids are somewhat hard to remove. I hope they loosen up with use. These bowls are great for microwaving soup and leftovers. I own 2 sets. One set I've had at least 16 years and still looks like new."
4,Good substitute for original,"It was great to find grab-its again, after failing for many years. The new ones have only subtle differences and are a bit heavier than the original, but do the job nicely. A terrific addition to any kitchen that uses a microwave!"
1,Don't buy it from Dynadirect,"The Corningware dish is great, my 1 star is not for the item, it is for Dynadirect. They are HORRIBLE! Item was backordered, but they never told me and charged my credit card. When I called they finally told me it was backordered and I ask that they cancel the order and refund my money. Bad, Bad Service"
5,Love these bowls,"We use these bowls everyday. They're the perfect size for soups, cereal or that small amount of leftovers you need to heat up in the microwave. I especially like the grab-it handle - it's perfect for the kids."
5,Awesome,"I had 1 of these my mom gave me and have dropped it, etc and it's still perfect. So my husband and I bought 7 more to have a total of 8. We use them for EVERYTHING! Freezer, Fridge, Microwave, Oven, Dishwasher, etc. They're like the perfect dish. Very durable, lids fit great. Haven't stained one yet. Dropped them more than once, still look great. Highly recommend these for anyone."
1,Lesson learned,"Amazon shipped the product in a timely fashion as is Amazon.com's reliable practice.I was dismayed with the product received, though. The Corning grab-it was NOT the Corning USA that I remembered, it was Chinese Corning Stoneware. They are not bright white, but have a grey tint and they are heavier and unglazed on the bottom. Can't blame anyone , but little ole me because I could have paid more attention to the product's description. Salvation Army will become the -4- grab-its new owner. Thanks anyway Amazon, it is not your fault, I should have remembered that ""Reading is fundamental""."
4,"Shore fishing, clambakes, beer, sunsets, murder and vacation","The sleuth lives a lifestyle I relish and admire. An ex-cop living on Martha's Vinyard spendind his days fishing, digging for clams, and walking the beach. His nights are spent with his beautiful wife, sipping on cold Sam Adams while watching the sun go down over the Nantucket sound. Everthing is how it should be until they're asked to hide the President's daughter from would be assasins. The plot is nothing special, but ""Craig's"" descriptions of Island Living and contentment made me wish I was in a hammock with an ale in my belly. Craig will take ten pages to describe the beauty of the shore at sunrise while you're fishing for Bluefish, ""oh by the way, the killer is in his car watching from across the street"". A wonderful lazy-day read."
1,cracked and stale,"These taco shells arrived in good time, but they were cracked and stale. I ended up throwing most of them away."
2,How is this an helpful item?,"I bought two of these, first two times using them, everything stuck to them. In both cases I was making cookies (with a lot of butter). I didn't add any additional spray/lube/butter to the mat, because I thought that was the point of using them. Theoretically cleanable in a dishwasher, but they're so floppy and large that it's impractical. I left them soak in the sink and the dough did come right off after a few minutes of soaking. But... how is this better than a regular cookie sheet? I can put that in the dishwasher. A cooking salesperson today told me she had the silpat (or similar) and they worked great. I told her mine stuck and she said, ""Oh, you must have the Kitchenaid ones.""Buy something else."
2,Not useful for languge study,"If you already speak both English and Spanish fluently, then you might enjoy this book. But most of us read bilingual books to increase our language skills. This book often pairs up English and Spanish proverbs that are quite different from one another. ""Abril, aguas mil"" is translated as ""April showers bring May flowers."" There is no literal translation of either the Spanish or the English. What is the point of a bilingual book where the ""translation"" is that creative - if not just plain wrong?"
5,Wonderful Solid Ring,"I ordered this ring and was amazed by the quality of it. It is very heavy silver - though not heavy on your hand. The ring spins freely and I often find myself deep in thought, spinning the ring. It truly is a high quality ring and I recommend it to anyone who is looking into buying a spinner ring."
3,A Good Source of Primary Documents,"Using people's letters to illustrate historical points is an effective way to learn history (and to learn that througout time, women have felt the same things and written to each other in the same way) and Kenyon's book is an excellent source in that respect. Of particular interest are the letters on illness and aging as well as friendship. I'm particularly glad she included passionate love between women, but find other aspects of diversity sadly missing. She does include some letters from Islamic women, but other cultures are sadly excluded (my suspicion is that this is from lack of ready resources at Kenyon's disposal rather than a conscious decision on her part). Some of the letters are enthralling, other's somewhat boring, and therefore similar to what you might uncover in your family's attic. This book is definitely worth the read, but I'm uncertain as to whether it's worth a purchase."
1,Disappointing,"I've enjoyed several of Hiaasen's books -- especially Striptease, Stormy Weather, Tourist Season, Sick Puppy -- but this one has been a disappointment. I'm about halfway through it and hope that the story and humor would improve has long since faded. I hate that I wasted a gift certificate on this book, so I'm determined to finish it. But you'll be much more satisfied buying one of the previously mentioned books than this one."
2,Nah......this one was not for me.,"Since he is the famous writer and I'm just a reader, it must me be. But I find stuff written in the first person and the present time a nuisance. Having read almost all of Hiaasen's books, this one was like a cold shower. I sometimes actually doubted that he had written it himself 'cause often the phraseology is so totally not the Hiaasen I got used to."
3,competent Hiaasen silliness; he's done better,"Carl Hiaasen's latest novel, 'Basket Case', is yet another comedy-mystery by Florida's most funny and cynical writer. In this installment we have the suspicious death of former rock start being investigated by an obituary writer from a local newspaper. It is silly without being stupid, and it comes with many funny one-liners. However unlike Hiaasen's better works (such as 'Skin Tight') the book's satiric bite is somewhat lame, and the kooky characters aren't particularly memorable. So it seems 'Basket Case' doesn't rise above the middle ranks of Hiaasen novels. But it certainly is enjoyable enough.Bottom line: okay, but perhaps best left to true Hiaasen fans."
5,It only hurt when I laughed,"This may be my favorite Hiaasen book to date. It's not quite as manic as some of his others but the bizarre characters, adventures and methods of demise do not disappoint. The romance seemed a bit too pat but this is similar to his other stories. I can't stop chuckling about the lizard.My husband got me this book to read while I recovered from surgery so it's definitely not too hard a read but thoroughly entertaining!"
3,Not the usual Hiaasen,"I am a big fan of Mr. Hiaasen. That being said I was pretty disappointed in Basket Case. It took me over two years to read this book, simply because I didn't care. It turned into the book I picked up and read a few pages in between the next thing I would read. The characters weren't as interesting as in Hiaasen's previous stories. The humor, which usually has me laugh out loud, was weak. Basket Case also lacked the pro-environmental undertones that he has become known for.This is the first novel that I've read in which Hiaasen uses the 1st person point of view, which is the hardest, and I'm not sure if that is what caused this one to be so mundane.Skinny Dip is next in line and I look forward to it, just not as much as I used to look forward to the next Hiaasen since reading Basket Case.James A. Forrest -Eye of the Storm"
2,Still on the way down,"For me, Hiaasen's work has gone downhill steadily from the awesome standards he set with Tourist Season and Double Whammy. I still very much liked Skin Tight and Native Tongue, even Striptease had its moments, but from then on I got the feeling that even the author wasn't really enjoying himself. Lucky You was pretty silly, Stormy Weather and Sick Puppy a pair of interchangeable bores, so with Basket Case he has made an effort to freshen things up by adopting the first-person, present-tense approach. Nah. Didn't work. You get the feeling he signed a lucrative 10-book deal with his publisher and is cranking them out so he can go do something else which he enjoys."
4,A Basket Case Too,"For a Hiaasen-novel this one is rather restrained and low-key. No wacko environmentalists, militiamen, ex-Governors, etc., even the most hateful fast-buck operator is not a resident of Florida but California. Hardcore Hiaasen fans probably will ask themselves if next he'll admit to actually liking Disney World ...Almost all characters are likeable, with the exception of some people on the fringes of (post?) MTV fame. The hero is a journalist with an obsession about death - probably a kind of workplace hazard for an obituary writer. But still, it damages one's social life if on learning someone's age the famous people who died at that particular age become the topic of conversation. Talking about a basket case ...Still, the book has the typical Hiaasen-touch: the evil in it get punished and the cynics who read it get to enjoy it ..."
4,Amusing and Entertaining,"Basket Case is an amusing read full of offbeat characters. Hiaasen has a breezy style that is easy to read--he's funny in a cynical kind of way. Basket Case's protagonist, Jack Tagger was once a promising journalist, but he got into trouble with management and is now banished to writing obituaries, which he somehow manages to make amusing for the reader (of the novel, probably not of the obituaries). He learns of the death of a former rock star, and the fun begins. Tagger sees a story in the death, sees that the story being told is not the truth. He digs deeper, believing that this may be his ticket back onto the front page. His experience makes an enjoyable, amusing read."
1,Worse than 'Sick Puppy',"I've been a Hiassen fan from the beginning. When I read "" Sick Puppy ', I could barely get through it. I'm sorry to say that I gave up on ' Basket Case ' after around 70 pages. I only laughed once during those long, long, 70 pages. I have to admit that I do miss his other regular human characters. However, the character I miss most of all is Florida. In all his previous novels, you could get a sense of the Florida feel; the heat, the rain, the oddball people, the ocean, etc. Not in this novel. Except for a few bland references, the novel could be taking place anywhere. Very disappointing."
2,"Carl, take a break for a few years","Don't get me wrong, I own everything this writer has published in hard and soft cover. This novel, however, is not one of the high points on my bookshelf.It's like Carl on low wattage SlimFast. While it's an easy read, it seems like it was also an easy write on the part of the Hiaasen automatic writing engine.Sorry, Carl...it is indeed a basket case. Throw away that dictation software and get back to the paper/pen/hand thing. You're talking too hard."
2,Disappointing,"I think too many of the other reviews are biased by Hiaasen's previous work. This one was a real disappointment. The plot was weak, there was only one decent character (Carla), and there was a gratuitous frozen lizard to give it the Hiaasen trademark. I've read and enjoyed Hiaasen's other books so his name alone was enough for me to buy this one. The next time I see one of his books I'll be more careful."
3,It was good but not what I expected,"I guess I should have read Carl Hiassen's other books before I read this one. I understand from some of the customer reviews that a good book to start with would have been ""Tourist Season"". This novel was predictable and a little slow for me. I did enjoy Mr. Hiaasen's descriptive writng when it came to characters and events. I was particularly ""tickled"" by the gal who used the Internet to make money by dressing in different costumes and ""talking"" to men. I think the banter between the protaganist and his boss was akin to the movie ""His Girl Friday"". I do agree with other customers in that I think (even though I have not done it yet), it would be agood idea to read his other novels. I have read excerpts and beleive that his other books outshine this by a mile."
3,average Hiaasen,"Carl Hiaasen is one of my favorite authors and Basket Case is the ninth book I've read by him. His books are fun, easily digestible ""beach reads"" that are often page-turners. But this one rates as just okay. His other books are more fun and manic. Skin Tight is still my favorite but Double Whammy and Sick Puppy are also a bunch of fun. Basket Case follows a death-obsessed obituary writer as he investigates the suspicious death of a bygone rock star who leaves behind an opportunistic low-class wife. It was a quick read but I was hoping for a little more entertainment value. Hiaasen can do better."
5,A must-read for journalists,"If you've ever spent more than six months working in a daily newspaper's newsroom, you must read ""Basket Case."" Carl Hiaasen has crafted a wacky and wonderful story about the search for the truth about the death of a rock star, but beneath that excellent layer are the all-too-familiar newsroom quirks and frustrations that any journalist will identify with."
4,A BIZARRE CASE!,"""Basket Case"" is another bizarre, witty, raw, graphic, clever novel by Carl Hiaasen. The plot has more twists and turns than a roller coaster and are just about as thrilling or gut-wrenching depending on your point of view. A wannabe investigative reporter trying to revive his writing career uses his obituary column to link himself to famous dead people. He stumbles into the quagmire of some horrific calamities and weird characters and the chase is on.This is vintage Hiassen. Those who have enjoyed his previous books will like this latest caper. All others, read at your own peril."
5,Rock 'n' rolling fun,"This was my first Hiaasen book and it surely will not be the last one I read. Not only is the author hilariously funny, but his view of the world of journalism is dead on target. As a reporter myself, I was amazed at how well Hiaasen describes the office politics, the infighting, the incompetence, and the odd love/hate relationship that journalists have with their profession.The mystery is a good one, although fairly easy to figure out, but it's the method in which he tells it that makes ""Basket Case"" worth reading. He creates a vivid portrait of the current rock scene, and leaves a bit of nostalgia for the rock 'n' rollers of days gone by.Read it when you're down; it's bound to pick you and get you laughing."
5,A Crazy Mystery in South Florida,"If you like Hiaasen's stories, set in the never-never land of south Florida, you should enjoy this one. I thought it was going to be a straightforward mystery, but that sly devil, Hiaasen, couldn't keep from being funny, and I laughed from beginning to end. The plot is simple. Jack Tagger, an aging, investigative reporter, is banished to writing obits for a south Florida newspaper when he humiliates the smarmy CEO of the newspaper chain. But he runs across the death of Jimmy Stoma, front man for the musical group, Jimmy and the Slut Puppies, under suspicious circumstances, and he romps off to investigate. Emma, his editor, tries to keep him in check, but he burrows into an increasingly smelly coverup of Stoma's death. As Tagger digs, Slut Puppies die like flies until he nails the murderer. It's vintage Hiaasen."
2,Few and far between glimpses of genius,"You know those non-descript concrete tiles, with all the pebbles encrusted onto them? Every once in a while there happens to be a pebble in the mortar mix with a different color, a special shine, something that makes you stop and look at it again. This is what happened to me with this book. Overall, it is quite dull and predictable (although I have to admit I didn't imagine Cleo's final was going to go down the way it did). Scattered here and there are proofs of Hiaasen's genius. This is the first book i've read by him, and I am not terribly impressed. For this genre and background, I think Elmore Leonard does a better Job. Nonetheless, this is the perfect book to take for a trip, for waiting rooms, for the side of the pool."
5,Who killed Jimmy Stoma?,"Once again, Carl Hiaasen takes us into the odd but appealing lifestyle of Florida, and the assorted oddballs that seem to abound there, at least in his books. An over-the-hill rock star dies in a boating ""accident"" in the Bahamas, and the obituary writer for a small newspaper begins to suspect that there may be more to the story than meets the eye. That being established, we have a spaced-out rock widow, assorted ""hard cases"", a young college intern at the newspaper, and a dead and frozen lizard, resting comfortably in a freezer on a bed of Dove bars. It's a wild ride from beginning to end, and holds the interest of the reader completely., It's not great literature, but it doesn't pretend to be; it's just good time passing reading, and worth every minute spent on it."
2,unconvincing music business mystery,"Hiaasen is convincing when he covers the newsroom, but his music business setting and ersatz rock lyrics ring untrue -- a real outsider's look. And my feminist hackles were set off by the triple cradle-robbing of the 39-year-old rock star and his 22-year-old bride, the 83-year-old newspaper mogul and his 36-year-old wife, and worse yet, the 46-year-old obituary writer and his 27-year-old hotshot editor? A perfect book for readers who like hoary old plots and horny old men. You'll see the plot twists driving down A1A."
1,He mailed it in,"I'm working on the assumption that Hiassen is on contract and he ""painted by the numbers"" and then mailed it in to get his check. It took me a month to read this pap -- couldn't put up with it for more than a 1/2 chapter at a time -- the irony is that he trashes the work of popular thriller novelist in this book. The only reason I finished it was that I paid full price at a bookstore chain and I had to justify the expense. It is really to bad because I could not put his earlier books down -- especially Stormy Weather and Skin Tight. Hope I have better luck with Hall's new book.If I could be so presumptuous as to give Mr. Hiaasen some advise it would be to take a year off and bring the Governor back!"
3,"Sorry, Carl","Oh, Carl, you have so disappointed me. ""Basketcase""was read just after Bill Fitzhugh's ""Fenderbenders"". Bothhad to do with singers, both a big disappointment. Maybethe rock/country singer mystery genre is not my bag.I guess I'm more into the ""Pest Control"", ""Lucky You"" kindof humor. Oh, well, maybe next time. Will still stay adevoted fan."
2,Uneven,"As a fan of Hiaasen's books, I was especially looking forward to reading his latest.In ""Basket Case"" the Hiaasen we know and love from ""Strip Tease"", ""Lucky You"", and ""Stormy Weather"" is hampered by clumsy (and unrealistic) rock-n-roll references. This is intended to lend an air of credibility to the book and its characters, but IMHO it was like a VH1-watching Hootie & the Blowfish fan trying to write about the Strokes or the Breeders or the Replacements- not believable.And when the dead rock star's posthumous anthem is described as ""early Buffet"" - please! Jimmy Buffett is NOT rock-n-roll!"
1,Hiaasen Bad,"As a northerner for real but a south Floridian at heart, I read everything Hiaasen I can get my hands on, including his twice weekly column in the Miami Herald. This was certainly not the Hiaasen we all know and love. The book had a few funny moments but all in all I was very disapointed. It was an OK read but not the vintage hilarity that Carl usually creates. A ""Tourist Season"", ""Stormy Weather"", ""Sick Puppy"" or ""Lucky You"" it surely isn't. Bring back ""Skink"" and the old South Florida cast of characters."
3,Loved it,"This book was one of the funniest that I have read in a long time. Carl hasn't let me down yet, i got hooked on his books arter reading skinny dip. This deffinatly was not a hard read but it was VERY entertaing. I would recomend this book to any one looking to have some laughs and kill some time. Later on this book becomes a real page turner and you dont want to put it down. I loved this book."
3,What's the big deal?,"Maybe I got a dud, but after hearing so many people rave about Hiassen I read this ... picking it totally at random from his other titles. Anyway, the humor is not dark. It's sort of lame, much like the Stephanie Plum books. Just 'wacky' enough to not offend.That said, this author is perfect to read while on a plane or beach. Nothing to think about, no characters to really care about. And, color me shocked, in ""Basket Case"" a 47-year-old man starts dating a 27-year- old woman. Please.I will try another of Hiassen's books, hopefully the next one will have the ""dark humor"" with which other reviewers commend him."
4,"My first Carl, of many","This was my first exposure to Hiassen's work. I first read about him on guitarist Pete Huttlinger's website/blog, where he compares Hiassen's writing to singer/songwriter Antsy McClain's work. Since I love McClain, it seemed like reading a Hiassen book was the right thing to do. Perusing the local library's holdings, I blindly chose this title. I'm glad I did. It's humorous, suspenseful, and provocative. He has a way of creating interesting characters, making them believable, and convincing the reader that these characters are worth following around for a few hundred pages.Though I'm reading one of his more 'serious works' - Team Rodent - I'm looking forward to reading his other novels."
3,A bit disappointed,"I have to agree that Hiaasen's early novels were so refreshingly hilarious that his later works pale by comparison. Basket Case, unfortunately, is no exception. While there is humor and mystery, to be sure, it just isn't up to Hiaasen's former standards. If you are thinking of reading Hiassen for the first time, start out with Tourist Season or another of the earlier books.Having said all that, most readers will probably find Basket Case a likeable little read."
2,"You gotta read Carl Hiaasen, ya gotta read Carl Hiaasen!","Well, maybe you do but this sure aint the place to begin that journey.What can you say, this book is a total mess. Its not interesting, its sure as hell notfunny. I had read Strip Tease several years ago and thought that was one of the bestexamples of pure caustic wit I'd seen since Dan Jenkin's Dead Solid Perfect, but thisthing.....got to be a ghost writer. There's a lot of that going around these days. Bad,very bad. You've been warned."
3,Below par for Hiaasen,"After reading Skinny Dip and Skin Tight, I tackled Basket Case. I had to force myself to finish it and often skimmed pages at a time to get through it. Predictable from the start. Certainly not Hiaasen's best work. I'm not giving up on the author, though, just being more careful about which books I read. Plan to read Stormy Weather next."
4,Fantastic,"I love Carl Hiaasen's mystery novels. This one was a thriller worth a second read. Its light enough not to make you bite your nails or keep you up at night, but will keep you wondering whodunit. This would make a great beach vacation read."
3,Big news conglomerate = bad,"After much repeating, we get the message. More characters are less cartoonish than usual, and we do care about them, but we have less fun than usual. The hero-reporter has a mid-life crisis going, that's resolved by falling into the arms of a woman who could be his daughter. The story seemed to go through the motions without the passion of earlier works."
3,This Basket Case is A Little Jumpy,"If you are interested in the life of a beat reporter in Florida, the music world or mortality in general, you should like this one. Hiaasen is obviously knowledgeable on the workings of a daily newspaper (he is currently a writer for the Miami Herald). At times he is laugh-out-loud funny and his character development is wonderful (I want to meet Emma). Where I lost him was the syntax and the organization of the book. The sentence structure sometimes made me feel like I was dyslexic and there was so much jumping around between the multiple thematic levels, I got dizzy. I still stayed up until 2:00 AM reading it so maybe I am just as lost in life as Jack."
1,This can't have been written by Carl,"I kept trying to get involved in this book. I tried to like the characters, the situations, the plot. Couldn't do it. Gave up on it a fourth of the way through. Gave it a ""DF"" (didn't finish) in my ratings chart."
1,Is Hiaasen being held by the taliban,"after waiting with bated breath for each of Hiaasen's new works,I was so terribly bored by this book I returned it unfinished fora refund. no humour no action Not Hiassen"
2,This is one Sick Puppy..............,"I'm a big Carl Hiaasen fan, but to be honest, this was not as enjoyable as say Sick Puppy or Stormy Weather. The humor is sporadic, and the characters fail to take on a life of their own. If anyone has read any of his books with Skink in them, you will understand what I mean by that.The main character, Jack Tagger is a reporter who has been demoted to the obit section of the paper and becomes a walking almanac of who died at what age. It's a running gag that is funny, but again, it's not enough compared to his other works. The plot is boring, a rock musician (Jimmy Stoma) dies in the Bahamas, and during the course of writing the obit, Jack has a lot of questions surface. He investigates and speculates Jimmy was murdered.Sadly, this just is not a very good effort from an author I thoroughly enjoy. Hopefully he'll get back on track. Bringing back Skink always seems to work."
3,Surprisingly conventional,"After all those rather outrageous and screamingly funny thrillers by Hiassen, this one comes as a surprise. Very conventionally written,it details the adventures of a veteran journalist who is in disgrace at his paper because he dared to stand up for good journalism and against corporate greed. These sections can be quite preachy. Hiassen is an investigative journalist himself and this stuff probably is very close to his heart, but very entertaining it is not (the environmental issues in his other books were a lot more fun to read). The thriller itself is rather conventional, there's not too much twisting and turning (I'm wondering what the other reviewers meant by that).For another writer, this would come across as a solid thriller. From Hiassen, it's a mild disappointment. There are a few interesting characters and a few good jokes, but if you want to start out with hiassen, start with Sick Puppy. Or Strip Tease. Or just about anywhere else."
4,as good as the hiaasen,"Hiassen's first few novels were so fresh and funny that he became a victim of his own success and kept failing when he tried to top them. for a while he was unreadable, zany just for the sake of being zany. with basket case he's back in great form and has written a very funny, dead-on indictment of american newspapers all while keeping the reader interested in the plot turns and characters. it's a wonderful accomplishment and laugh-out-loud funny. anyone interested in how newspapers work, forget all those self-serious reviews of the business that have come out lately and read this. it's better, more accurate and a hell of a lot more entertaining."
4,Not Up to Par,"This was an OK mystery, but it didn't even make me smile--let alone laugh out loud--like his other books. I missed his usual whacky characters and situations."
3,Past Glories,"Carl Hiaasen must be tired. His earlier books were SO much better. I used to find myself howling at scenarios and now I find a plot that just muddles along. His last three books have been the same. None of the new titles match Double Whammy, Tourist Season, etc. in wit, character development, or story line. Yes, I'm disappointed!"
2,Did Carl Hiaasen really write this?,I find it hard to believe the same writer who wrote the crisp and hilarious Sick Puppy wrote this book. There are elements of the amusing moments and eccentric characters I known and loved from his previous books but I found myself rushing to the end not because I wanted to see how it all worked out but to put an end to the book and move on to something else ... anything else. I admire his ambitions of moving to different areas of his writing but this book was not even close to his best work. The story was pretty obvious without any truly tense moments. One thing I admire about his books is his way or wrapping everything up in the end through creative means but this books ending was seen coming almost from chapter two. It is almost as if someone else wrote the book while he was out on sick leave. I hope he gets well soon.
4,Good quality,"I've been using these lights for a few years now and they've held up very well. I've dropped the stand a few times so they have some scratches, but they still work just as they did when I bought them. Easy to control settings on the back too. :)"
4,Introducing African Music,"Very interesting and original mixture of good music. I found clasic masterpieces (Ismael Lo, Cesaria Evora, Oumou Sangare) and many auochthonous melodies, perhaps only enjoyable for local people."
3,JP in JC,"I knew I would receive this damaged from the other reviews. It did arrive with cracks (about 10) and one of lower right panel glass was broken in three pieces which were still in the box. I decided to keep it since if I saw this at a flea market in as in condition I would buy it. I crazy-glued the three pieces together , and unless you really look, you cant tell where it was broken or cracked. I am pleased with this purchase. I did buy the peacock window and not the dragon fly window where my first review is."
2,paacock suncatcher,"The item was received broken as all the others, it was bowed in the middle and cracked in several different places and the frame was pulled apart it would have been beautiful if it were in the right shape still kept it anyways will count my losses"
5,Outstanding book which helped me feel relaxed and prepared.,I read this book prior to surgery. It helped me relax about the surgery and recover more rapidly. My doctor commented several times on the fact that I did not request pain medication. I believe that was due to using this book. I highly recommend it for anyone facing surgery. It should be a part of the lending library of every physician.
5,Take charge of your surgery,"Peggy Huddleston's 5 step program to prepare for surgery made all the difference for me as I underwent a modified radical mastectomy with reconstruction recently. Just reading the book convinced me that I would come out of this surgery with easily managed pain as well as an early discharge from the hospital. Her program is easy to follow and it works. It asks you as a health care consumer to take an active role in your health and work as a partner with the doctors and the hospital. Very powerful stuff, and so easy to implement, once you gather the nerve to do it!"
4,Prepare for Surgery;Peggy Huddleston,"This book provides ways for dealing with surgery that are useful and effective, easy to learn. There is a lot of repetition and it could be condensed to good effect. Taking control of how to get through a procedure and learning how to master one's reactions is affirming. Staff at the major hospital I used were familiar with this approach and cooperative, supportive and encouraging. Dealing with and in-control patient is much easier for hospital personnel."
5,Helped so much!,"I have to say, I feel so lucky that I was given this book before my surgery. I was so nervous leading up to my surgery, I could barely eat. Even though I got this close to my surgery date, it helped immensely. It really makes you become more aware of your thoughts, and the tape that came song with it was wonderful. I couldn't believe how relaxed I felt. I am already an anxious person, but on the morning of my surgery, I was feeling very positive. Afterwards, I did not need to take as much pain meds, and I was able to move around more than expected. This book really made me realize how powerful my thoughts and way of thinking can make a difference in how I experience life. The mind/body connection has been proven, and it really worked for me!"
5,"Yes, It Helps","The book is both reassuring and helpful. It gives very practical tips on how to make your surgery successful - actions that can be done from the time you get the book to after surgery.The audio tape takes you through relaxation exercises that will at the very least help you to get to sleep at night. More importantly, the tape will help you to learn to relax so that you can think better during a stressful time.I took the tape into pre-op. The surgeons said they wished everyone would do that because I was so relaxed and confident about the surgery.Most important, I got out of the hospital early and healed quickly. I give the book and tape credit in helping me accomplish this."
5,"Read the book, used the tape, had a great recovery!","This is an important book! Peggy Huddleston tells you how to use relaxation methods and visualization of your outcomes (for surgery and recovery - or chemotherapy) in a very straightforward, practical way. She also tells you how to approach your surgeon and anesthesiologist before surgery, what kinds of questions to ask them, and how to get them to help ensure a positive outcome/recovery by using healing statements during surgery and post-op. Most of the pieces of Peggy's method may seem familiar, but no one has put them in one place as such an easy to use guide. I used the book and tape prior to major surgery, got out of the hospital (my choice) in 1 day, and took no pain meds after 1 day at home because I felt so good. It worked for me."
2,Never Heard How it Was,"My mother really wanted this book because she had her hip replaced, so I got it for her. She powered through it but never really said anything one way or another about its contents. My guess is that it wasn't particularly helpful because my mom is big on gabbing about what she's reading."
1,"Prepare for Surgery, Heal Faster","I feel hard-pressed to give this even one star. I bought both the book and the CD--neither of which were any help whatsoever. In fact, absolute rubbish! I think there are probably some relaxation techniques that could be useful, but you won't find them here. Taking a few Zoloft before surgery will go a lot farther than anything in this book/CD. If your doctor has given you medication to deal with your pain, take it! I cannot stress how strongly I feel about this swill."
2,Not what I expected,"Thought this was about building guns. This is another reality show with set up guests. Also when they do actually build a part or edit a gun they don't show you what they did. Its a ""secret"". Save your money until you can pick it up for $5 used/new"
4,Co. Aytch review,"pretty interesting views, stories are always best when told from aperspective of a low man on the totem pole."
2,Just not the same,"No one will ever capture the sound that Skinny Puppy produced over so many great years. This album proves this. It may have the same words but certainly not the same feel. The only song that closely resembles the anger captured by Puppy in the origional recordings, is the track produced by Leatherstrip. Yet, even this falls far short of expectations. This album is only too pay tribute to the true masters."
4,pales in the light of true puppy,"well, this certainly has a few good remixes of Skinny Puppy songs, but the sounds don't capture me as well as the originals do. However, i thought it was a good effort and couldn't rate it under four. Although it isn't orderable through Amazon as far as I know, I reccomend Dystemper, the new remix album, above this one."
4,"Poorly Titled, but fair remixes","This album is getting ripped to shreads and honestly it's time some gave it a fair shake. Okay, so it isn't Skinny Puppy, nor would I take it a a 'tribute' album. It is a remix album much like ""Dystemper"" (which also gets ripped into alot). If your a fan of Puppy and the more b-side/experimental side of them, as I am, than you might enjoy this album for that whole reason. I look at it as a tribute/remix album. This album is mostly good, with a few dull tracks. I wouldn't suggest picking it up at full price, but if you can get a discount than add it to your Puppy collection. I like it."
1,Pure insult,"Well, I've only listened to a small clip of this tribute album, thanks to RealPlayer, and I can already tell how much I would hate it. If you haven't had the sheer pleasure of listening to Skinny Puppy before, this isn't the way to go. Cleanse, Fold, & Manipulate is my personal favourite followed by Bites. The next best thing having lunch in the cemetary is listening to Skinny Puppy."
4,"Good fights, first and last event were only so so though","Here are the matchesMARVIS EASTMEN VS TRAVIS LUTTER-man eastmen sucks.TONY FRYKLUND VS IVAN SALAVERRY-2 TOUGH guys. One proves to be way tougher on this day though.EVAN TANNER VS ROBBIE LAWLOR-really good match, Robbie Lawlor seems to be learning.CHARUTTO VERISSIMO VS FRANK TRIGG-Verissimo had a battle with Matt Hughes that went all 3 rounds. Matt Hughes won but I honestly thought it was a tie and couldn't figure out how they gave it to Hughes. This is a really good match, but both fighters don't appear to be great by any means.MATT HUGHES VS ST PIERRE-the fight you have ben waiting for. I was dissapointed but it is still a good fight.RICH FRANKLIN VS JORGE RIVERA-this was a truly epic battlePATRICK KOTE VS TITO ORTIZ-Kote is tough but really needs to learn the ground game, BADLY!!!!"
1,Patrick Cote?,"The only thing that could have possibly saved ufc 50 would have been if the original main event of Mezger/Ortiz had actually taken place. Instead the ufc decided to put in some no-name Canadian 185lbs fighter to take his place. In typical Tito-like fashion, he takes the Canadian down and lays on him for 3 rounds. The only bright side on an otherwise dull night is the St Pierre vs Matt Hughes fight. But one fight is not anywhere near good enough to save this night from total and complete disaster.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, as can be seen from this event, the UFC is far behind."
4,Good Quality - new design,"2/13/2013 I use these headphones to listen to audiobooks. I use them continuously for 10 or more hours per day as while I work around the house. They are excellent quality for speaking sound range. For $6 I do not mind replacing them as needed. I buy 2 at a time so I have a back up when one ear goes dead . Fussing with wires will work to return sound but once they go out they stay unreliable. This is the 3rd time I have returned to this great value. Each set lasts me for about 2000 hours, so if you do not use them continuously like I do they may last quite a while.UPDATE 2/16/2013. Fast delivery! They have changed this product. It has a Better design. Same quality of sound. There is now only a single wire coming from one ear rather than having wires to both ears. Since this design will have less tangling issues I expect the lifespan will be longer. It is very unusual for a company to change a design and use the same model number but in this case I am sure glad they did!"
5,Great!,"The book I got was in great condition, no marks, and I got it right on time, in time, to use for my class!"
3,"Beautiful, highly-detailed figure is a definite keeper","This figure is magnificently designed, with highly-intricate and flexible armor and accessories. Points of articulation include neck, chest, one shoulder, one bicep, and one forearm. Swords are attached to hands, and with the solid, unarticulated lower half of the body, makes this toy somewhat limited in poseability yet more durable than other Spawn female figures. Spear inserts through loop in back, while leggings are removeable into front and back halves. Though not exactly a toy for kids, this figure is a must-have for anyone who appreciates wonderfully crafted fantasy figures."
1,Showstopping Glamour Girl,"This Spawn toy is one of my favorites! It is VERY hard to get. I got mine from Amazon.com when it first came out, and I love it!It was so hard to find in stores that I ordered 2 of them! Like all Spawn action figures, it doesn't move but is very detailed. Odd that it is considered to be an action figure! I recommend this toy because it looks exquisite. It isn't educational because the only information you learn is what's on the box! it isn't durable because it doesn't move and if you force it, it will break.....that's just my thoughts on that, I haven't learned from experience, but I have heard stories! It can be fun if you make it fun by the way you display it, but playing with it is NOT an option! It looks great on display! She really is a ""showstopping glamour girl""!"
1,Company AND product ranked below 1,"Ordered two braille watches (Reizen) for my granddaughters. When I removed them from the packaging, I found 1)Neither(!!) watch was working 2)there were no operating instructions for us to give the girls 3)No local jeweler would touch them. 4)I contacted customer support and I had to pay for the call!! That was adding insult to injury. 5)Now I will have to pay exhorbitant shipping fees to see that my precious granddaughters get the watches they want in time for Christmas, PLUS I have to pay to send the watches back!! Very poor quality control. Every order should be checked BEFORE leaving the company.I will NEVER order from this company again."
4,The enigma of the orator,"This well-written account of the abortive coup of 1923 is not listed among the sources for the wikipedia article, perhaps because of the lack of footnotes. Although it is to be expected, it is still somewhat annoying to see on almost every page a study drum-beat of belittling adjectives such as shabby, shoddy, turgid, etc., when speaking of Hitler and his followers, whether one is talking about their clothing, their literary style, or whatever. Here we are dealing with a man who deserves to be mentioned in the same breath with Attila, Genghis Khan and Tamerlane, and all we get from the author is a petty throwing of verbal spitballs at him."
2,Lacking real world implementation examples,"Not a bad book if you want to understand the behind the scene details of the fiber transport technologies, but if you are wanting to take the details and apply it to real world implementation, there is a lot to be desired.I would not recommend this book to someone who is trying to implement FTTX, but its a good book for someone who is really trying to dig into the technology itself."
5,Great asian movie,"When i saw the cheap price ($10.00) of this movie i thought it was going to be a bad bad movie but i was very surprised to find that this is one of the best films i have seen and i have seen many. the acting was top notch, if you want a good drama/action movie about asian mafia, romance and friendship then this movie is for you."
5,Writing that's exquisite - smooth as cream,"Cleaning out a bookshelf recently, I found this book. As the snow fell outside, I discovered exquisite writing, characters instantly opened to the reader, intensely felt. The stories, full of detail to just the right degree, still unfold as smooth as cream. The pain of loneliness, illness, abandonment, death coming unfairly to the young, pulls the reader into remembrance, yet there's a hope and nobility and innocence to it all. This is an author of great talent. Reading this is a privilege."
5,great foot toy,My senegal loved it! tore it up in just a few days...Perfect! I will definitely by more for her! thanks
3,clear heart pendant,"looks so pretty in the picture, not so in reality. brought it for a friend, almost didn't give it."
2,pendant,I ordered a Swarovsky crystal pendant which I thought was clear like one I had purchased once on a visit to a Swarovsky factory. The one I received is clear but not like the first one. It is transparent but has a gold tint which keeps it from being as transparent as the first one. I was disappointed.
4,Roedelius - 'Snapshots / Sidesteps' (Psychonavigation),"Unofficial title: 'Roedelius & Friends, 1995-2005'. Ten track CD collection with remixes of previously released material. Has Roedelius working with other artists like the Fratelli Brothers, The Orb, fellow Cluster player Dieter Werner Moebius among others. Personally, I liked the epics tunes the best - like the eleven-minute ""Claire Obscure"" the weird eight-minute (yet upbeat) ""Hoc Volo"" and the artsy-fartsy ""Juste Milieu"". Overall, not a bad pick. Listen to the sound bites where provided and then make your decision."
3,ok not great,"I got these from a small shop in an airport and wasnt expecting too much to tell you the truth. They are really loud, in fact i dont think i have had headphones go this loud from my laptop. The sound is very tinny (no bass whatsoever). For the price they work and they come with a carrying case so not so bad but i wouldnt recommend them for everyday use."
1,Garbage.,"These earbuds aren't worth the price. They are uncomfortable to wear for any amount of time, as the tips are quite hard, contrary to what is stated in the product description. These headphones also will not properly stay in your ears unless you hold them there. Don't buy these. Spend 5 more bucks and get something that will sound and fit better."
2,very....very basic,"You must know that you're not going to be getting much for the price you are paying. The bass is nonexistent and the sound is bad. I only use my pair to listen to podcasts at work so it doesn't matter to me. The cord's a bit short, but overall they're perfect for what I use them for and I can leave them on my desk without worrying someone will take them."
3,"Okay, but short cord and flimsy","Not bad for the price; however, the short cord makes it difficult for computer use, since my computer is not too near my monitor. Furthermore, after a few months of using it, the right earpiece is starting to die. The sound quality is okay and the fit is surprisingly comfortable for hard plastic earbuds; however, you probably will want these out of your ears within an hour!"
4,Does what it says it does ...,"This product does exactly what it says it does. The only thing that it does not say in the overview is that it has a chest strap. I like the fact that it is water proof, and is very comfortable. I use the alarm on the watch every day. It is very easy to use. This is a very good deal for the money."
1,Difficult,"This was purchased 2 months ago and has already cratered! It is extremely difficult to get the battery in place on the watch. After hours of trying to pry the back off, finally able to get the battery in but in doing so the spring was no longer able to keep the battery in place which in turn rendered the whole thing useless. If it hadn't broken it would have been great as it's needed for keeping track of heart rate during exercising."
1,Heart monitor suckfest,"""Another company that has the consumer does the quality control. It worked if you believed that your heart could go from 125 to 170 and down to 140 in less than 5 seconds. I have bought three heart monitor this year a Nike ( awesome except someone wanted it more than me and Nike doesn't carry it anymore but I was able to find on eBay for the same price of the Oregon brand new and a 99.9% favorable rating with over 21,000 sales. It originally cost twice as much but it worked great.) A Garmin that never worked and this Oregon. Welcome to the suckfest."""
2,Readiness Review?,"I found this book to be less than adequate. I ended up looking to additional resources for the items that I knew were on the test (ODBC Errors) This book did not even touch those areas. I have used the Readiness Review books for all of my exams and passed every one but would not have passed this test without additional help. The book has a few good points, the questions explain the right and wrong answers which aides in the learning process. All in all, get some other book if you want too learn from scratch!"
4,Good Test of Knowledge.,"I found this book to be a good test of my IIS4 knowledge.This is not a study guide of any sort, it is a book full of sample questions and detailed answers to those questions.This book is not intended to use as a learning tool, but rather as a knowledge test. And as a knowledge test, I found it to be pretty good."
2,"Save your money, don't buy this ....","I attended the exam for the first time this afternoon and passed. Before the exam was started I was pretty confident about myself cause I almost got all questions answered correctly in this Readiness Review, but what I found out was that the real exam questions are so different! Of the 55 questions, I'm not sure about my answers for almost 40% of them, ..... and at last I only passed with a slight margin. If it were not for a little bit of luck and my previous background on ODBC and TCP/IP, I'm sure I would have failed. So go get another better book instead of this one to get you prepare for the IIS4 exam."
1,The book is uesless for studying or reviewing IIS.,Save your time and money. The book is poorly organized and gives you a lot of reference books wihtout telling you where the point is. I don't understand the reason MS let it published.
1,Typical Microsoft collaboration with Self Test Software.,Practice exam questions are poorly articulated and answers are frequently incorrect. This book is helpful only in the same way as a physician who wants to amputate a sprained finger: you are forced to seek a second opinion and may learn something useful as a consequence. Poor students will be further perplexed. Alert students will want their money back.
4,Sturdy and practical flatware set,"I really like this set, the plates are large (I thought they might be too small) however the bamboo pattern does not look as nice as the pictures online. I still love the set which has not chipped thus far."
5,Corelle is great for the outdoors,I bought the Corelle dinnerware for use on our patio and it is just great for outdoor dining. It is very durable as well as very pretty. I am going to add the glassware to my collection.
3,corelle plates,Decent for the price. One plate was chipped but overall it is a nice inexpensive set that will not break in microwave. We in past had a nice ceremic set but did not hold up in microwaves--so decided to try this set.
2,A tough read,"Translated from the French of the authors, this book suffers from the unsuccessful results. The translation is choppy and the text subsequently hard to follow. Several of the authors have backgrounds in geology so the rocks of Britanny figure prominently in a book you would expect to be about ancient sources and archaeology in the ground, not the ground itself.The subject matter is very interesting regarding the Dark Age migrations of the British to Britanny. The major written sources, their limitations and silent periods are discussed in detail.The authors assume the reader has a working familiarity with Britanny's geography and its post-Dark Age past. I could only give the book two stars due to its various difficulties."
5,Reading the Bible to Study the Bible,"Great book, get it! It helps you cross reference everything, checking Scripture with Scripture is a great study tool."
3,Exhaustive in Cross References,"This is an good resource that is used as that, a resource. It is a book that Torrey ut together to give an exhaustive use of cross references within Scripture. This does not always take the context of the word in how it is being used so please be sure to check the context of the passage when using this resource. Overall through this is definitely a helpful tool for studying and teaching Scripture. Use this as one of the last resource though through the study and teaching portion."
2,very confusing and overwhelming,"I thought this would be a good, easy to use reference book. I was wrong! I still don't know how to use it and dread opening it. I much prefer my concordance. This book just seems to take me in endless circles and I do not enjoy using it."
2,Don't Bother,"Poorly laid out, hard to use. They go way off into the weeds by referencing even the most mundane words."
4,Understanding,"Pornography invades your home now wheather you want it to or not. Little by little by little. It's in commercials, movies, TV shows, children's toys. It's subtle and it's blatant. You don't have to take a chance on being seen going out to buy it. Women are involved too. It is an addiction that you can't totally stop like eating. You can totally stop smoking or drugs. There are books with lots more information, but this is a beginning. All addictions are cured spiritually, and you need the help of others who have done it. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Talk with a pastor or go to AA."
5,a great endeavor,"A clear concise ""matter of fact"" textbook with excellent editing and no mistakes. Teaching is both a combination of knowing a material or subject AND being able to successfully explain and show it to others. I was fortunate to have Leonard Russikoff assigned to me as a guidance councillor and Allen Sherman as an instructor for a general chemistry course, and to have used there text book as material for a basic chemistry course at Middlesex County College, Edison, NJ"
3,No good songs :(,"I'd never heard of this group before but I'm always willing to try new things so I picked up a copy of this CD and popped it in my car's CD player. It was just a bunch of weird beeping and some voices talking about it being ok to take this out now. I can't believe what is passing for hit music nowadays. I popped in another CD after this one and went on my way, but I feel like I got ripped off."
3,Did the Job,"Did the job I needed to clean all discs components, very handy and use ful to have, for all cleaning"
2,Didn't fix the issue,However I dont know if this or anything like this would have fixed the issue with my Cd player to be honest
4,Worked on my Apple Macbook Pro (even tho not supposed to),"I was having problems burning DVDs in my Macbook Pro SuperDrive. Bought this and didn't realize it said ""not for use in laptops"" until after inserting disk and it getting ejected without being recognized by the drive.BUT...it worked! Tried burning a DVD afterwards and it worked. I guess it spinning in the drive trying to be recognized did the trick.How 'bout that..."
2,Questionable benefit,"I am unsure of the benefit of using this CD lens cleaner. It MAY have solved the problem of a dirty/dusty lens, but it may not have, as the problem on one CD player was only temporarily resolved. Another CD player that otherwise worked fine could not recognize this disc at all, and on all of my players that did, it could not advance to the third track, which contains only music. Significant skipping was noticed on all CD players, including those that never skip on other discs. If nothing else, this cleaner may provide a superficial and temporary fix, but if your CD player's lens needs cleaning, there are likely better and more effective ways of solving the problem."
4,Great product.,Perfect shipping and delivery. Product is exactly as described and works perfectly. Effective in stopping the frequent skipping often seen in older CD's such as the ones from the library.
3,Maxell - oh well.,"It's just another lens cleaner. A used one works as well as a new one. It knocks the dust off the laser tip in the guts of your machine, nothing more. It won't clean grease off anything. It won't repair broken parts. It won't make any sound. It won't make termites move out of your equipment.It's the same as any other brand. Only the name ads another dollar or two to the price, but it's still the same as any other brand. Actually, I'd prefer buying an unknown brand, as long as I knew all the guts were built into it like it's supposed to be.If your house is as dusty as mine, sooner or later, you'll need to use a lens cleaner. Just buy the cheapest you can find because there's not much to them....can I have a dollar for this review? Please?"
2,LATE LATE LATE,This is taking FOREVER. It's been over a week and the damned thing hasn't even SHIPPED yet. PFFT. Order from elsewhere if you want it within a reasonable timeframe.
1,Worthless,"I tried using this product to clean the DVD drive on my Zenith Surround-Sound system, and it wouldn't run at all. It was a complete waste of money."
3,Soap Soup,"I loved SOAP and wanted to find some videos of episodes. Why are there never any reruns of this popular show?? It was not clear that this video was a ""review"" of Jessica's life (while talking to Bea from Golden Girls as the greeter in heaven). While it was good to see my old favorite characters again, I have never liked seeing brief snippets of scenes that were really good and leave you wanting to see the rest. What I had hoped for was a video with several actual episodes. The video seemed very short. Concidering the price, I expected it to be as long as a movie. As a ""review of Jessica's life"" and ""SOAP Soup"", it was good and worth watching. However, I will probably not buy the other ""best of Soap"" videos available."
3,Just Snipits,I didn't enjoy the snipit version of this video. I would have rather seen whole episodes.
5,This book is now available for shipping in the U.S.,The only authorized biography on this amazing group of artists. A must for not only the music community but also the art world.
1,Evenflo has horrible customer service,"We had the version of this carseat that was recalled. I had JUST bought the seat when it was recalled a few days later. I got the replacement part and it was not a solution at all. It required you to strap the carseat to the base completely rendering the base useless. In fact, if you didn't use the base you didn't even need a new part. Anyway, I called the company and told them that this was not acceptable. They refused to take the seat back and said the only thing they were offering to the consumer was the strap. I refuse to buy anymore products from this company because they do not stand by their products and obviously don't test them well enough before they are put on the market. Luckily, Walmart took it back because it was a defective product. I would not buy Evenflo products."
1,Angel Food Pan----NO,"This pan will bake your cake but when it comes time to cool it you will be disappointed. I turned my cake upside- down to cool and it fell out onto the counter. There is no way to keep it in the pan to cool in the proper way, so I had a flat cake. Will never use this pan again."
1,These headphones sound just horrible!,"Please, don't buy these headphones. According to the quality of their sound they should cost half a dollar only. I've been searching for a vertical headphone during weeks and finally, after checking a lot of models and prices I decided and purchased this crappy little garbage. They sound just awful. Terribly awful. Also, they lie in the package since the package boast a frequency response of 16Hz-22000Mhz and the online info regarding this model says it's actually 20-20000. So, unless you wish to hear your music as coming from inside an empty Coke can, do yourself and your ears a gracious favor, and stay far, far away from these headphones which don't deserve that name."
3,Head bud is too high for my head,"I have a normal size head, but the headset sits above my head, it doesn't hug the top of your head & you can't make it any smaller. The cord was a great length & the sound is fine for working out at the gym, just wish it wasn't so high on my head. Was bummed because I have looked all over for a foldable head set.&#128513;"
1,Did not fit well for people with small ears and not large heads.,"They didn't fit, sent back, refund was quick. Thought the idea of folding headphones was a great idea but they just don't fit."
1,Awful,No bass. It really *does* sound like you are listening to a (distant) transistor radio through a coke can. I can't believe they put these on the market. Back to Walgreeens.
4,If you like salty!,I received the product in good condition.The quality is excellent although a bit salty to my taste.Recommended.
3,Only for mindless relief,"This is pure comic relief, Hong Kong style, with a so-so story line bolstered by a few 'twists' here and there. Excellent with Chinese take away or times when your mind needs a good break."
4,Brandilyn Collins is a master storyteller,"Known mostly for her seatbelt suspense, Brandilyn Collins also pens haunting women's fiction. Cast a Road Before Me could almost be classified as a coming of age tale. Deep, complex emotions characterize Collins' writing. I loved Cast a Road Before Me and give it a high recommendation."
5,Great Christian fiction!,"I enjoyed this book tremendously!! A really good story, and great examples of how God answers our prayers!"
4,Good stuff,"This is good stuff, my face is clearer, softer and better overall. I would recommend this to anybody out there looking for something like this product"
4,A solution to the marriage mess,"Great art by Fred Carter! The story is about some people who go to church but don't really completely practice the values the christian church teaches. But lo and behold their missionary relative just back from a long stay in Africa arrives and stays with them awhile and teaches them by words and his own selfless deeds what a ""real"" christian should be like. They resent it at first but the whole family become ""true"" christians towards the end with everything wrapped up in a nice neat bow. Typical Chick stereotypes with perhaps a little more practical truth in it than the usual Chick publication."
4,My elderly mother loves it and so do all her out-of-state children!!,"My elderly mother is in an assisted living facility and was having great difficulty distinguishing between her television remote control and her cordless telephone. She was frequently disconnecting the calls, lowering the volume of her phone, or not ""hanging up"" her telephone at the end of calls.This telephone is a ash in color (as opposed to black, the same color and size of her television remote), ""looks"" like a telephone, has no extra buttons to cause confusion, and the quality of the sound is excellent on both ends of the conversation.It has been a God send!!!"
1,poorly made phone,"I ordered this phone for my mother-in -law that refuses to wear her hearing aid, so she cannot hear the new phones and will not pay for a phone that has a better ringer for her to hear the phone ring. This phone does not even have the switch to change from pulse to tone, and when you plug it into the phone line it won't even work. I am in the process of sending it back because the phone does not work at her house or at any house for that matter. I was very disgruntled with this order and this phone. I wouldn't buy another one like this one for the life of me. The black one I ordered works, but this one does not. I guess I will order another black one."
4,Evenflo Booster Seat,"I like the extra 'secret' compartment and the arms that can be raised or lowered. They are a little wide, so three seats for three kids do not leave a lot of room for the seatbelts, even in a roomy back seat. Once buckled in, however, they are very comfortable."
4,nice grill,"Love the grill, it give my truck more style and it was easy to install. i would purchase another in the future."
4,Beautiful colors warm up the room,"We already owned the matching runners to this area rug and enjoyed the geometric shapes and modern design. The warm autumn colors in the 8x10 size coordinate well with our Spanish tile and the terracotta chairs in our living room. The edges curl up a bit, but I'm sure they'll flatten out with use."
3,High grade did not mean quality.,Bought these at a great price & thought that high grade meant excellent quality. Not so! Almost half of the tapes do not work properly and had to be thrown away. Won't be buying Maxell again. Very disappointed.
2,Gay for Physics,I found the character development to be the tome's finest quality and the randomly sprinkled double entendres left me weak in the knees. Definately the last great American/ British epic novel.
2,A waste of time and space,"A massive letdown. And the twist ending? Pathetic! Not a scratch on his previous effort ""Wet Street: Diary of a Croydon Rentboy."""
5,Unintentially one of the funniest movies of all time.,"I happened to catch this movie on the Action Network one night and laughed myself to tears. It's absolutley ridiculous, the stunts and ""special effects"" are horrifically hilarious. Not that this movie is terrible, its horrendous, its aweful, is gut wrenchingly funny. I've showed this movie to about ten people and all of them have laughed their arses off. It's worth the rental or the purchase:)"
3,Good for some laughs.,"If you've ever enjoyed watching cheesey martial arts flicks just for the laugh value, this is definately one worth checking out. It has some of the silliest dialog, action sequences, and plot devices (including ninjas that turn into piles of grass that scurry away) I've ever come across.My friends and I enjoy pulling this movie out from time to time just for the comic effect."
2,What a disapointment!,"We were so let down when we received this tiny little board book. Though most of the (6) illustrations are sweet, they are much too small to be appreciated. The text is terribly dull and silly, and the book does not ""flow"" at all. Our 15-month old (who LOVES both books and birds) has no interest at all in this book, and neither do we.My advice is to avoid this book and instead go for ""About Birds: A Guide for Children"" by Cathryn Sill (also for sale on Amazon). Unlike this book ""About Birds"" has lots of beautifully illustrated pages, and interesting text that holds our toddler's interest and keeps him wanting more."
5,great for little hands,"This is a wonderful little book for my daughter. It is a little book, but than again, so are her hands."
2,So small,"I'm not a fan of mini books. I must have missed that in the description that this is a tiny book. Maybe it's good for travel? But my 15 month old son loves big pictures. The book itself is quite cute, but it's just so small. Maybe a couple inches tall."
5,"Tranquil, Soothing, Heaven!","If you want to let your hair down and sit down to total and complete tranquility, this album is perfect. It is so soothing that when you close your eyes you feel like you're floating on clouds"
2,Frustrating 'Music',"Becareful about buying this cd based only on hearing the sound clips. The basic sound of the album is soothing and appealing but all of the songs go nowhere. I kept expecting to here the compelling opening sounds of each song go somewhere but instead was continuesly frustrated by the lack of development. I can't even tolerate it as a background-drown-out-the-noise-while-I-am-at-work-cd. Obviously there are many people who find this to be exactly what they are looking for but I have discovered I prefer artists like George Winston, Secret Garden, and Jim Brickman for my background ""ambient sound"". If you have a trained ear and can't stop using the left side of the brain to hear music, this cd will drive you bannans. Others may find it suits just find. In any case try to listen to one or two complete songs before making a decision."
4,Fine Product- Warranty listed wrong,Product looks fine. Bought this one to get Maxell quality item backed up with a lifetime warranty. Only problem is that package says 90 day warranty. I am hoping for Maxell quality because I could have gotten other chinese made ones for a whole lot less. Fix the listing please.
5,best I've ever used,"This is a great product. The tape noise is very quiet. You hardly hear the tape spinning, even with the volume turned down. The sound quality is great (for a tape adapter), I've had no distortion at all (I'm connecting mp3 player to my car stereo). I've been very pleased with it."
4,Lasted 2 years before the wire gave out,"I'm actually a bit shocked. I've been using this cassette adapter for the past two years. The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes. The cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well. In cold weather, it sometimes sticks a bit. But overall, it has worked quite well. I don't leave my mp3 player in the car, so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging. It managed to last 2 years, which is excellent considering how quickly 8mm stereo cables can develop shorts."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"Bought this unit to use with a Sansa E280. Really great price of $10.49 but the sound quality really lacks. Guess I shouldn't beef too much considering the price. It is useable, but as another reviewer said, it sounds muffled. I have an infinity deck with 10 speaker infinity sound system, so I really don't think it's my system. I guess my next move is an FM unit. Hope it sounds better."
4,Sounds good to me,"These things cost around $20 at most B&M stores, so this is a great deal. Maxell is also a great brand name. I've had 2 others for my car cassette player, both of which worked well, but broke after a year or so. Sound quality is good, the cord is not too long, and so far no issues. If this lasts more than a year for me I'll upgrade the review to 5 stars!"
2,Buyer beware,"I purchased this unit to use in my 1997 Ford Explorer with factory radio/cassette. Unfortunately, it will not work in my cassetee deck: the unit is constantly ejected."
2,Worked for one trip,"This was nice while it worked. Something keeps the internal gears from turning continuously in the tape deck. Not sure what, but the tape player in the car rejects the adapter as soon as the gears stop turning. It thinks the tape is stuck.Will have to find another solution."
3,OK for the Price,"I use this to listen to audio podcasts, so sound quality is not most important. For the price, it does an adequate job, but produces a soft, plastic rubbing sound, about every 3 seconds when in use."
4,Cassette Audio Adapter,"Works well, purchased as a replacement for another that just wore out over time. Sound quality is very good with no sounds or squeaks from the cassette player."
2,Works as advertised except sound quality is low in my car,I used this to play my Creative Zen MP3 player in my car (Toytota Matrix) tape player. The sound was very muffled and I have to turn my stereo volume way up to hear it at a good level. I would not recommend this device for this combination of MP3 player/car.
2,Very Dissappointed. Loud Humming and NO lower end Bass,"I've owned a Monster, Panasonic and a Radioshack cassetter adapter and I just bought the maxell adapter and here's my review. First off I also have a LOUD HUMMING sound coming from the adapter that I don't get from the other 3 adapters. Not so obvious when you have the music turned up but definately obvious when you are in between tracks. I was pleased to see that it has dual magnetic heads like my Monster adapter but it produces very low pre amp volume thus requiring you to turn up the volume and getting the loud humming. There is absolutely no lower end bass unless you crank up the bass on the tape player. The mids and the treble sound fine though."
2,Click Click Click,"The cassette, as other have said, makes a clicking noise as it runs. I have it in a 2001 Rav4 OEM stereo. It will also cut out when tracks change on the music player. Very annoying. I would not have bought this except for the Maxell name. Disappointed."
3,Hummm,"It seems to work OK, except for a hum, which isn't too noticeable when the music is up. I wouldn't really expect much more from this kind of device."
1,Maxwell cd adapter,"Should have listened to the reviews instead of chancing it. Horrible, I'm sorry, did you hear me, HORRIBLE product! The cord began to go out the first day we used it. Even no music is better than spotty, in one speaker then out the next music. We purchased another one at a local store. Don't waste your money."
1,le sigh,Most of the time my cassette player spits it back out after it has a mini seizure and when it finally does accept it there is an incessant clicking noise. In order to have the music play at an audible level I had to max out my phone's media volume and then practically blast my radio's.
1,Piece of Chinese junk,"Works for about two seconds until it does the whole reverse tape side thing a couple times, and then spits it out. Not worth the money. Do some research and invest in one that works."
2,Maxell CD-330 Adapter,"Can't turn up the volume too much or I will start hearing some distortion. Not very pleased with overall sound quality. Sound seems muffled. The product does get the job done, but not the way I would have hoped."
2,Go Sony instead.,"I got this because I thought my Sony cassette-to-3.5mm adapter was broken--turns out it was my mp3 player that I had attached to it that was malfunctioning.So once I replaced that, I figured I'd go ahead and keep using this Maxell adapter. Bad idea. Even with my ipod at max volume, I had to have my car stereo volume at about half (twice as high as it is for the radio or my old sony one), and when everything is turned up that high, the quality is just bad.Also, I like to leave my ipod plugged in in the car now and then, especially on long road trips. But this? The audio cable is very poorly shielded and charging it and listening to it at the same time is a no-go--unless you happen to enjoy that incessant buzzing sound.So I've been using my old Sony one and it all works just fine--and I suggest you save yourself the time and hassle and do the same."
2,Wannabe,"This book tells the story of two people whose careers took totally different paths - one to success and one to near complete failure. The author of this book, Edward De Leo, worked with Al as a mentor very early on in Pacino's acting career, and probably helped him a great deal, but once Al became successful, De Leo was little more than a nuisance to him, hitting him up for movie parts and money over the years. The story of Edward De Leo's life is really pretty pitiful and the introduction of little bits of information about Pacino, although somewhat interesting at times, fail to disguise this book as anything other than one more attempt by a man who perhaps feels entitled to a piece of Al's success, to exploit it. Kudos to Pacino, who, by all accounts, treated this ""old friend"" with kindness and generosity. For Pacino fans, there are some interesting tidbits..."
3,WereWolf Reborn..for a half an hour film..,"Ok..well..I saw the movie(duh)..i rented it..it was ok..not of what i was expecting..the story was good..they could have made it a little longer an better..the werewolf effects were advrage..better than the howling 2,3,4,5..atleast werewolf reborn showed the werewolf..but it is an entertianing movie..i say make your 5 (possibly 4) year old to 7 or/& 9 year old watch it..(an the ages inbetween)..i think those ages would get frightend out of it..but ages that are older..would either hate it or rate it ok."
2,"Gypsies, Pentagrams, and Silver, Oh My!","They claimed to have tried hard, yet, they did so little. ""Werewolf Reborn"" is a hackneyed attempt at a werewolf movie, using the old cliche of gypsies, and pentagrams (though no wolfsbane). There was nothing original about the movie, not to mention that the werewolf looked lousy (just a guy with big, furry ears)."
4,THE WEREWOLF REBORN!,"This is a truly entertaining movie, especially for those new to the world of classic horror, though this is new.It stars actors from popular tv series. The makers of this movie are true horror fans who love wahat they're doing. The story is about right for a werewolf movie. A girl is visiting her werewolf uncle in a faraway village. She learns he's a werewolf and tries to help him - until he turns on her and she knows what she must do. The werewolf itself is scary(not too scary), and the transformation is wonderfully done. Not destined for fame, THE WEREWOLF REBORN made me remember that there still are people who still appreciate the good ol days of monster movies."
5,"A must have, even if it is not on sale","Probably the *best* rock opera I've ever heard is ""Eye of Wendor"" by Mandalaband (this was an one- album wonder band - an amalgamation of The Moody Blues and Barclay James Harvest members). If you like albums like ""Journey to the center of the earth"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", or other rock operas, this is sure a must buy. You <b> should </b> get this album, even if it is not on sale."
4,very cool looking ....,why pay over $100.00 for similar 'metallic' looking briefcases? when you can have one that looks over $100.00 but only you'll know what it really cost!! * * * I have two myself & use them all the time.
5,Soul As Healer,"""Lonnie Joseph Nichols has presented us with a text that is as multifaceted and holistic as his philospphy.

2,Not what was expect,"Although relatively well produced, this video is not for someone expecting light pornography with frontal nudity. Nor does it lend itself for teachers of nude or tantric yoga."
4,Beautifully done,A wonderful devotional you can use again and again! Amazing how it seemed some days were written just for me!
5,"""Jesus Calling""","This is a wonderful book that speaks to each of us exactly where we are on any given day. I keep several on hand to share with friends and family. I highly recommend ""Jesus Calling""."
5,More than very pleased,"This daily devotional is a personal encouragement from our Lord Jesus Christ, spoken to us directly from the holy Scriptures in a way that is intimateand very precious. I recommend it highly for your own daily reading or a wonderful gift."
4,I like it,I did the Kindle version so I cant really write my thoughts down with out another book. Its a good pick me up.
4,"Good, accessible devotional...","This daily devotional is very accessible--written for the lay person, with two to four scriptural references each day. The power of the message for me is the perspective the writer has taken--Jesus calling to me each day."
5,Great Book,This is a great book to lift your spirits and help bring Peace when you really can't seem to find any in your life. Totally recommended.
5,Absolutely amazing!,"This book is the most amazing book for daily devotions that I have EVER come across! I have given it to several people and they have ""paid it forward"" by doing the same! I have it on Kindle now and LOVE IT!!! Each page is divinely inspired by the Spirit of God and speaks directly to MY spirit everyday!"
5,Love it,I love this devotional! It is always what I need to hear on that day. I've bought several and given them to friends as gifts.
4,Great addition to my Morning meditation time,"I really really enjoy starting my day off with a little guidance from above, and this is a great addition to my morning meditation time. It is as if Jesus is speaking to me.I would recommend this to anyone seeking a little more divine guidance in their meditation time or to anyone seeking to start doing so."
5,Written as if Jesus is talking to you.,Written as if Jesus is talking to you. A great easy devotional about 2-4 paragraphs long with some scripture references. Excellent!
5,An Amazing Book-Read and purchase for others!,"My boss and her husband read this devotional together each morning. She gave me a copy and I love it! Some mornings we share how the Lord spoke to us through his Word. I bought one for each of my daughters for Christmas and they are now loving it. I just found out my brother-in-law has stage four cancer and am sending one to my sister to read to him during this difficult time. Sarah, thank you for sharing and having the Lord use you in such a marvelous way!"
5,This was a gift,I bought several and used them throughout the year as gifts. They were a hit. Ordering & price was great.
5,Jesus Calling,"This book has met and exceeded my expectations so far. Her devotionals are short, to the point and always something I can apply to my day.I would reccomend this to anyone."
5,Best Devotion Book,This book has been such a precious way to be in the Word and here from our Lord. I am a Christian therapist and I purchase these usually 10 at a time to give out to clients and to give my family members. I am always amazed at the very personal way God uses it to speak to me each day. I thank Sarah Young for allowing God to use her personal journal to speak to so many hearts.
5,What a blessing,The devotionals in this book go day by day but I find myself wanting to keep reading. One of the best devotionals I have ever done. I feel like each message is written just for me.
5,Jesus Calling,"If you are ready or desire to move your relationship with Jesus into deeper waters, the words in this daily devotional will send you down that narrow path. I've given this treasure to over 40 people and each person that is reading it has raved about the blessing they have received from it."
2,Shallow,"I found this book to be rather shallow. Does the author really believe that Jesus talks to her every day while she listens? Yes, I'm sure Jesus does sometimes tell us things through the Holy Spirit if we take the time to listen, but I sensed that too much of this book was out of the author's own mind. We have to be careful when we attribute thoughts to God. Some have fallen into error because they think God has told them something, but really it has been their own thoughts. For instance, I was at a meeting where someone spoke and said that God had told him something that was absolutely contrary to scripture. In Jesus is Calling, nothing is contrary to scripture, but it is fairly trite.I would have been more comfortable with the book had the author said it was thoughts she had had. The Jesus I know is neither trite nor shallow."
3,"Jesus, or a middle-aged lady?","I purchased the audio book of Jesus Calling. The devotional is to be read (or heard) on the premis that it is actually the Lord speaking to us. Imagine my surprise when I popped in the CD and found I was being spoken to by some middle-aged lady.In my opinion, that TOTALLY unravels the context of this devotional. Somebody dropped the ball BIG TIME on this one. =( I'm sadly disappointed."
1,"Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling""","I initially gave Sarah Young's ""Jesus Calling"" a great review, mostly because I had never encountered a devotional that had Jesus speak directly to the reader. At first, this concept was intriguing to me. As a born again Christian, however, I have become increasingly convicted when I pick up this book. Why? Because the words written on each page are not Jesus' words, but are portrayed that way. Even though the author *may* have felt Jesus saying these things to *her*, how are we to know for sure? The only words that I trust as Jesus spoken words are directly from the Bible. I don't feel comfortable reading this book anymore. It feels like heresy. I feel the same way about the final ""Left Behind"" books that write in dialogue from Jesus. I don't think anyone should put words into our Savior's mouth. As a Christian, be wary of trusting any words attributed to Christ that aren't in the Bible."
1,New Age spirituality,"I had been recommended this book by 2 highly regarded acquaintances who have had a long history of solid Biblical foundations. The book contains many Scripture references, but when I finally got around to reading the introduction I was struck by the New Age-type viewpoint expressed. Too much of a mystical sentiment is expressed.I would recommend extreme caution in reading this devotional."
1,Nice sounding but speaking for God is unsettling...,"Of course there is nothing really offensive in this journal; however, all the text is written in the first person as GOD HIMSELF speaking -- in other words, prophecy I suppose? Truly I believe in all the Gifts of the Holy Spirit but prophecy or God Speaking messages need to be judged and confirmed. It is a little troubling for someone to just start talking and speaking directly as GOD HIMSELF. At the end of the day, God can speak for Himself and has already in the Bible. I suggest a daily reading of the Bible would be more beneficial since Christ's words are Spirit and life. I don't know where untested prophecy comes here? Overall, what is said is not offensive; it is merely just another book that takes the Christian away from reading the Bible itself. I consider that fact a loss to us all."
1,"Not Christian, it's New Age!","As I read through the book, a red flag instantly popped into my head. This reminds of the channeling books that I read when I was deeply into the new age, like Conversations With God. I am NOT comfortable with this as a Christian. She is putting words into Jesus' mouth! This is heavily liberal, progressive, new age propaganda!"
5,God is good,"This book was bought byu my husband, beore he went into surgery to remove a cancer on his pancreas.He was in the hospital for a month and each day he read these pages of this book, and he was humbled,strengthend and felt the love of God.Great book."
5,A Positive Way To Start Your Day,"Jesus Calling is a positive way to start each day. By taking a few minutes each morning to read the daily message, I find myself much more peaceful and centered. This book is a wonderful tool to renew my mind (and spirit) as to what is really important in life and helps me to be more joyous and positive in addition to living a more faith-based life. I would recommend Jesus Calling to anyone wanting peace, joy, and comfort in their lives."
5,Excellent book,This is a most inspiring book. I haven't read a book Sarah Young has written that IDid not love and connect with. My friends are all buying and enjoying them as well
5,Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace In His Prescence. (Daily Devotional),This is such an awesome devotional. I have shared it with many and all feel the same. It is very personal and very powerful.
4,Jesus Calling: 365 Day Journaling Devotional,"This devotional is very good, short but thought provoking. And I like the opportunity to be able to record my thoughts below each page. It was recommended to me and I would also recommend it to everyone."
3,"Great book, not so good eInterface.",I have a print copy of Jesus Calling and love it. I thought that having it on my tablet and smart phone would be good (it is) and that having the convenience of a journal on the go would be good. Unfortunately the journal feature is not as easy to use as I had hoped. Otherwise the eBook version of Jesus Calling is great.
4,Jesus Calling Book,This book is very good. I would recommend it to everyone. I bought it as a gift and my friend loved it.
5,5 star~the BEST devotional I have ever read,"This is by far the best devotional I have ever read or owned. I LOVE it. It keeps your attention, and if you are a person who struggles with always being in control, and not giving God the reigns of your life...then this book is for you."
5,Jesus Calling,Excellent Amazon service and price. This book is ideal for a daily devotional. I use it during my quiet time with the Lord. It is pertinent to daily life and has scripture to go along with each piece.
5,This little book is a treasure!,"A friend gave me this little devotional and it has spoken to my heart in such a tender, encouraging, embracing way. It truly has a God-inspired message for me every day. I have given copies to several friends and to each of my five grown children as well. I recommend this little book with all my heart. You will be blessed by it!"
5,The best Christian journal I've ever owned,"I read Sarah Young's journal each morning--just before I delve into my Bible--and it's simply uncanny how often she seems to be writing about me and how I'm feeling that particular day. She reiterates focusing all of your attention on Jesus, and for very good reason: He is the only One Who can give us peace and carry our burdens. I heartily recommend this book to Christians and non-Christians alike. It will bless you beyond measure.Gary LombardoAuthor:My Friend Jesus"
4,Wonderful help-book,"Insightful, varied, succinct- and easy help for daily living. It's also a managable and portable sizeI recommend it for people young and old."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,I look forward to the devotion everyday...feels like the message is written directly to me. Best devotional I've every used.
4,Delivered what it promised,I enjoyed the feeling of intimacy and closeness .to Christ so often evoked by this book. This is what the book promised and it hit the mark.
5,Jesus Calling,"This devotional was given to me by my brother right after our dad passed. The words were perfect each day, just what we needed. Three months later one of our other brothers passed unexpectedly at a young age. Again, the words were there like a healing balm. I believe the author completely sought the Lord when writing this devotional, and that He is present at our need. I love the highlighting and journaling features. They are very organized. I recommend Jesus Calling to any believer seeking to know Jesus more intimately."
5,Love it,I had already downloaded Jesus Calling on my kindle & love it! Ordered more for the ladies in my Bible study and for gifts at Christmas...each days reading seems to speak directly to you.
5,Jesus Calling: Excellent,"Totally, totally pleased with this book. Is just like a special word from Jesus Himself each morning to start the day."
4,Devotional,"I'm always on the look out for a good spiritual book. This one was recommended to me.While I totally agree with the premise the author is writing about, I don't feel that there is enough variety- kind of repetitive.I guess I'll give it as a gift to someone. Anyone having a birthday soon?"
3,"Hey, Jesus Got a Ghostwriter!","Our Lord has a lot on his plate--it's a busy born-again world down here, especially here in the USA. The ugliness and hate-mongering of Christians may be pleasing to Him, but His Blessed Mother has been on His back to make them tone it down. You know how mothers are. She thought that something like a new set of gospels might be in order. ""Alright, Ma,"" He said. But he pulled a fast one and hired Sarah Young to do the job. In fact, they went into business together and have been cranking these out for a while now. ""Just keep it sappy and we'll be up to our halos in cash,"" He advised her. And so she did. Young was indeed a godsend, piling on the treacle in an endless trail of pious drivel, basically two or three wispy little hooks repeated endlessly in slightly different wording.So, three stars for reeling in the suckers."
1,"Ugh, bible thumper crap",Someone [Who didn't know me very well at all] gave me this crap. What awful propaganda and a load of crap. Tossed it in the trash immediately. I already hate bible thumpers - let alone bible thumpers who feel the need to recreate and try to throw some new innovations on their bible interpretations. Ugh!!
2,Jesus Calling CD,"I purchased this item for my 97 yr. old care receiver, but it keeps skipping all around on the tracks. I thought it was the first disc, but the others did it too. It may start on track 8, skip to track 32, and then back to track 14. This doesn't work for her or me. I thought it was my CD player, but when I tried it elsewhere, it was the same. I will return it.Thank youJanet Herzog"
3,Not bad,"Not bad, but devotions are too short and not very practical. Readings are too short as well. Would also like relevance to daily challenges"
5,Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence,Reading this inspirational messenger is a great way of starting my day. The message is simple and definitely has had an important in my connecting closer with Jesus
5,Jesus Calling,"I have read many books in my life, and Jesus Calling is the most treasured book I have ever owned. It is so personal and meaningful every morning to start my day. It is as if Jesus is right there talking with me, comforting me and preparing for my day with him at my side.A friend suggested that I buy and since then, I have given it to many friends.There has been a peersonal turmoil going on in my life and this book has helped me cope in so many ways.Jesus Calling is the most wonderful way to start a day!"
5,A must buy.,This is the best devotional book I have laid hands on. So relative to my needs and jump starts my every day. Highly recommend it.
5,Great Book Too!!!,I really really enjoy this book alot. It makes my day go very special. Can't start my day ubtil I read mit first.
5,Outstanding devotional book!,"I love this book. I especially like that it has the dates on it as you never get behind. This is one you can use year after year as it doesn't matter about the year since it's not printed on each page. Also, the length is just right, not too long, not too short...just right. Love it!!!"
5,Jesus Calling,I read everyday......because it is the BEST....the gift that gives everyday....next year I just start from the beginning again....it keeps on Blessing you.
5,Great gift,"Used as gifts, which were well received and appreciated by all. Best daily devotional guide in a long time. Higly recommend for great start of each day."
4,Great book,The service was good. Came when I expected and it was cheap. I wish I would have known that there was writing in it before I bought it...
4,Needs more of the Gospel,"I've never read a devotional that sticks with me like this one does! Sarah Young does an amazing job with this book. However, I wish that she would incorporate the Gospel more -- interweaving the miraculousness of Christ dying for sinners into her beautiful messages. Christ's death on the cross for me is what enables me to live for him. Without that motivation, some of the days just fall flat for me. I love to read all the Scriptures she posts at the end of each day."
5,Five Stars.,The daily passages are very uplifting to one's spirit. I look forward to reading it each day. It's a wonderful book!
5,Priceless and reassuring.,"Such a neat little book, small and cute. It easily fits in a purse and goes with me on many outings.This book has helped many of my co-workers. We find this useful when helping our clients and their families. it's almost like God is speaking with you and guiding you through the day, sometimes preparing you for what is to come and how best to handle it."
5,A profound book that all believers must have,"This is a profound, deeply meaningful book. It has changed my life almost as much as the Bible. Every believer should read this devotional each day upon arising. Must have."
5,Great Devotional,Jesus Calling is a great way to start your day no matter your age. This is a must devotional for everyone. What are you waiting for?
5,start your day peacefully,I found very rewarding to dedicate 5 minutes to the reading before I start my day. I start my day with a peace of mind and trust in the Lord.
4,jesus callng,Excellent. I have been touched many a morning and have offered a days devotion to needy members of my church.
5,Excellent in every way...,"I received this book for Christmas from a friend. I have many of these types of books and few really get to me. This one is different. It is truly inspired. Even my 9 year old daughter picked it up on her own and said, ""Hey mom, let's do this together."" That's a first! Even children can appreciate the simplicity and depth of the days devotion combined with the relevance of the scripture. I love this book and now have made it my mission to buy it for all my friends and family."
3,Jesus Calling,This is a wonderful book. There is a page for each day of the year. Each page has a very supportive short paragraph about how letting Jesus into your life will strengthen you for meeting the problems of each day. There is a listing of scripture at the bottom of each page too.
5,Great Book!!,This book is very encouraging. I read it every morning and have given it for gifts. There are tons of great verses!!
2,I guess...,"It was ok, but I swear I heard Carlton Heaston's voice the whole time. Kind of preachy. This book is best digested in small chunks, otherwise it all blends together."
5,Wonderful devotional book,"""Jesus Calling"" is written as though God is talking directly to the reader. Scripture references for each entry are included. After using this book for several months, I purchased copies to give as gifts to friends and family. I find it to be encouraging as it reminds us who we are in Christ and all that we have in Him. I highly recommend this book."
5,Highly recommended,This book has been so helpful to me on a daily basis. I also love to give it as gift.
5,I love it,Sarah YOung brings the Bible to life and breaths life into a poor souls weary heart with her words. YOu should buy ten. !!!
2,Jesus calling,"I ordered two new books. One was new, had been somewhere damp and the pages were all wrinkled. They came in the same plastic lined envelope. I gave the good one as a gift and kept the wrinkled one. I did not try to get a replacement, good one, because in the past the other than Amazon seller gave me a hard time."
1,wonderful books sent in disgusting condition,This book Jesus Calling is a wonderful book. It is the manufacturer that sent the 3 copies to me in terrible condition that I have a problem with. I am trying to leave them a review but not sure if they will see this.
2,Do not read books written in the first person concerning the God Head,"A friend recomended the book so I ordered without knowing any details. IL just read the introduction, enough for me"
5,Very satisfied,It was just what I thought it would be. Got for a friend and she is really enjoying it. She requested it so i am sure it is fine.
5,It's God Speaking,"I usually don't review products unless there was a problem, but am making an exception. I have used this devotional book for the last 6 months. I have used many books over the years, but this one is unique. It's written in the first person, as if God is talking directly to you. The readings (messages from God?) are very short, but every word counts. It speaks to me as I would expect God to speak--encouraging yet challenging, coaching, guiding, unconditional acceptance, loving, no reprimands, no guilt. My countenance toward myself and others has been so improved by the peace reading the passages each day provides to me, that I am giving 20 people on my xmas list this book. I'm 50 years old and have never given anyone a devotional book before, but this one is too special to keep to myself."
5,New Christians would benefit greatly from this as well as mature Christians,"New and mature Christians would benefit greatly from using this little book. I keep it at my desk at work and find it a fantastic way to start my day. The daily readings are short, scripture supported and referenced. It speaks to our daily lives and is so very relevant.I am buying 12 for Christmas gifts. What a great way to celebrate Christmas!"
5,Read it!,We use this book at work every morning in our prayer group. It's a great way to get your day started off in a positive way.
5,Excellent devotional,"Brings the Scriptures to an even more personal level than ever. Nearly every day, the message is just what I need."
5,Wonderful,Wonderful little devotional. Great for any time of day. Size makes it easy to pack for travel. Highly recommend this one!
5,Jesus Calling,This little book has been such a blessing to my life..The Lord continues to speak to me through the message each day. I have given the book to many friends and they then have given it to many more. It continues to touch each life.
4,Thrice read,I haven't read the book. My wife likes it. She loans it to friends who don't return it. Then I have to re-order it. That might be the sign of a keeper.
5,Jesus Calls Daily Devotional,"I start each day reading the daily devotional for that particular date. The way it's written, it is like you are actually having a conversation with Jesus every day."
5,Jesus Calling,This book was given to me by a friend last year and I have in turn given out over ten of them to friends also. It has changed the way I pray and brought me closer to Jesus.
5,Can not stop talking about this book!!!,"This book was given to me by a co-worker. Each morning look forward to reading the devotion for that day. This book encourages me and helps me to keep life on the right path focusing on God. A friend was diagnosed with ms and i purchased this for her. She told me the book had meant so much to her. Very gifted author,that will truly touch your daily walk with God."
5,Life changing...,"This daily reading book is the greatest one I have ever read. I give them as gifts to all who are interested.Each day, there is a personal message just for you. Sure helps through the hard times and helps celebrate the good times."
5,Scripture Personalized,"I am writing this review on behalf of my mother, Kathryn, who uses this book every morning for her daily meditations. Even though my mother is a well-versed in Scripture, she finds new understanding from the way the scriptures are presented with personal pronouns. She has found this devotional book so helpful to her spiritual life that she has given copies to her best friends."
5,get out your paper and pen.,"this beautiful book, small in stature, but big on Spirit is the perfect devotional for anyone, male or female, no matter where they are at in their lives.get out your paper and pen.sit down and pray.listen to what God says to you.write it down.That's the premise of this small in size daily devotional. you can hear God speaking to the author, as she writes down the very thoughts He gives her. Then you can apply them to your own life.A very moving book that stirs you to tears when you find how each Word God gives Sarah fits right into your life too.I heartily recommend this to anyone who is truly seeking the face of God and His knowledge, for anyone who wants to hear God speak directly to them. For anyone who wants to hear God's kind and loving words, as a Father speaks to His child."
5,Jesus Calling,"This is a beautifully written daily devotional book. Written as if Jesus is talking directly to the reader. Sarah Young creates a very individual personal experience.It is not filled with personal experiences and quips, or long passages to read. You will be surprised at the sparseness of the daily reading and yet the message is powerful and personal.This is a devotional that will endure time and be fresh year after year.Thank You to Missionary Sarah Young for a timeless treasure."
5,touching,"While I have not had the book long enough to read it through, I think I am going to enjoy it. The book itself arrived in excellent condition.This daily devotional book is written in the first person as though Jesus were in the same room with you and you are having a personal conversation; reminding you that He will never leave you, and encouraging you to look to Him for the grace and strength you need for that day. This format can help you to ""practice His presence,"" and keep you focused on the solutions rather than the problems."
4,Pleased,The lady that we gave it to has repeatedly indicated it has been a help and blessing in her devotionals. One area I was discouraged about when I reviewed it was that it used a variety of the translations of the Bible. Would be more benefical if it just used the Old King James Version. The lady did say that she reads the verse in the King James Version and often sees a difference.
5,jesus is calling,"I am not a religious person but I considered myself spiritual. This book was given to me as a gift....and I thought ""oh boy here we go"". I LOVE THIS BOOK! I read it every morning and have given it as gifts. It is written in a way it speaks to me so clearly I have no doubt as to what God/Jesus is saying to me that day."
4,Great Way to keep your life God centered,I love the author of this book!! Sarah Young through her books keeps my walk with God real and relevant. Her other writings are just as powerful and Spirit filled. I will continue with SEEKING PEACE in 2013!
5,Drawing closer,This is one of the most enjoyable devotionals I have ever studied with. I haven't missed a day since I purchased it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to draw closer to our loving Saviour and realize His constant existence in our lives.
3,Not what I expected,"I thought it was going to be the book size and not a minature. After looking back in your info, I was unable to see where it said smaller size."
5,Uplifting and an easy read.,"This devotional is, in my opinion, one of the best I have found. It is easy to read and very uplifting. Gives you a good start to your day!!"
5,HE Speaks,Have you ever wished that Jesus would audibly speak to you or write you a personal letter? Well this book is written in a way like Jesus is talking directly to you. And I like how it is scripturally based. It has ministered to me in so many ways at so many times. I'm definitely looking forward to giving these books to others.
5,The gift of peace,"My cousin found this book and I'm forever grateful to her for sharing it with me. Jesus Calling has brought peace to my daily life, especially during difficult times."
5,My preferred book together with The Bible,"I have read this book almost three times. I start every year on the 1st of January to read it. It is really encouraging and useful. Regardless of how you are doing in life, it is an extraordinary book that teaches us how to remain close and linked to God. I have have shared this book with my children and they also love it. It has a daily reading which has enriched my life over the last years. I am sure that you will enjoy and learn a lot from the Bible as well."
5,Great gift!,"This was given to me as a gift, and I have since given it to 4 more people! Wonderful meditations that seem to meet you where you are!"
5,Jesus Calling Is Peace!,"Jesus Calling Is Peace! Knowing that each day's devotion is Bible-based gives me great comfort. I read it and hear Him speak directly to my heart with love and clear direction. I've given more than ten copies to other people, who say the same to me that the book is changing their lives, bringing them in closer relationship with Our Lord Christ Jesus."
1,Not what I expected,"I first saw this book on a kindle and like what I saw. I ordered two books to give to seeking friends. When the books arrived, the printed version removed the scripture verses and shows only the references. My seeking friends will never look up the verses since the scriptures are unfamiliar to them. This destroys the value of the book from my perspective."
5,Good read,Everytime I read from this book it is applicable to my life at that time. Gets you hooked on reading the Bible for each days guidance
5,Fantastic and Relevant,"I highly recommend this short, daily devotional. Each day will inspire you. It honestly seems as if the book was written just for my family. An intimate relationship with the Lord is what this book promotes. Very Good."
2,Good review of this book to consider...,"By Kathy Keller, wife of pastor Tim Killer of NYC Redeemer Presbyterian Church[...]Basically what I would say in a review if I was as smart and articulate :)"
5,Excellent devotional,"This is a go-to book for me. I have the nook version and the hardcopy. I like having the hardcopy in hand, just something about it but the nook version has it's pluses also. It's a devotional that I can read quickly and get a real sense of Him speaking to me but also when I take the time to sit and be still (which this encourages me to do so) the words are scripture based so I find it really easy to enter into prayer and really talk to Him because I know they are words He speaks to me. There are verse references at the end of each devotional in the hard copy and in the ebook the references as well as the verses themselves are included for you. I highly recommend this book. It's also a great gift idea or a stocking stuffer"
5,Comforting Devotional,"I received this devotional as a gift and have been reading it daily for about 6 months. It's a quick read, and the tone is comforting and loving. Although it seems light-weight at first read, this book has given me a new understanding of what Jesus wants from me in our personal relationship. I'm giving it as a gift to friends for Christmas this year."
5,Jesus Calling,This daily devotional will be enjoyed and shared. It's timeless and can be used over and over for years to come. This devotional is all about God speaking directly to you and how He desires this personal time with you. You'll never regret buying it.
5,A Very Well Done and Inspiring Book,"What a neat book. You have a page for every day of the week for a full year. On each page is a devotional that is written from Jesus' point of view, so that the I, Me or Mine refer to Christ, and the ""you"" refers to you the reader. Therefore, the perspective of the devotionals make it seem like Jesus is speaking to you.Following each devotional are Scripture references, and after that you'll find about 10 blank lines for you to journal in. I suggest reading them in a quiet place, so you can reflect on the devotionals more effectively - and then jot down any thoughts that come to mind.All-in-all, I found it to be a good layout, and I really liked the fact (with my busy schedule) that the devotionals were short and easy to finish. Just a great tool to help you search for a deeper experience of Jesus' presence. Can also recommendThe Prayer Project: How Each One of Us Can Make The World a Better Place to Live - In a Few Minutes a Day."
5,Everyone Should Start Their Day With This Book,"My friend sent me this book and I just can't tell you how uplifting it has been for me. I've never enjoyed Christmas - yup! I think it goes back to my childhood but that's another story. I started using this book to start my day and for the first time in my 65 years, I really found JOY this Christmas. I feel as though God is talking directly to me and reminding me to put my troubles in his hands and stop trying to control life. It has been so helpful to me - so helpful that I ordered it and gave it to a younger friend of mine who is struggling with life's issues. If you have a friend who is struggling, or if you yourself are struggling with life (and who isn't, right?), I totally recommend having this book by your bedside and before starting your day, read a passage. Its amazing how life can get ""Joyful"" if you just let God in."
5,Beautiful!,"This is a beautiful book, Jesus is talking to you! Very different from any other devotional. I feel the joy, peace and love of every word written. A must have for every Christian."
5,wonderful service!,"Ordered and received VERY quickly,, all in good shape....Thank you for great service I can always depend on.... wonderful inspiration especially for critically ill people..."
4,Great Devotional,"This is a great devotional written in the first person as if God is speaking right to the reader. Note: not genuine leather, but a nice substitution since our bookstore was out."
5,Great Devo,"I really enjoy this daily reminder of Jesus walking with us through life. It is encouraging to read Sarah's writing for each day and then the verses that she applies to it. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a daily devotional that promotes our continual walk with God, with Him leading the way."
5,Great Daily Devotional,I give these books as gifts!!!! This book has brought me closer to God and continues to do so. Thank you Sarah Young!!!
5,Jesus Calling,Love the book/ devotions so much I wanted to share it with my friends. Is God speaking to me on a daily basis.
5,great gift,"My mother loved this. Large print was perfect for her. Lonely book, feels good to hold. I would recommend this book to everyone."
5,"Excellent devotional....Sara Young has really heard ""Jesus calling'!",This book is currant and relevant. It is amazing how each day seems to fit exactly what is happening in my life!I love the scriptures references each day which are helpful and keep me grounded in God's Word. This is an excellent compliment to any bible study.
5,Wonderful!,"I read this version daily as my personal devotional, and we also have the kids' version that we read as a family. It has truly touched us all and makes a difference in how we face our days. Highly recommended!"
5,Magnificent!,I included this book into my daily schedule.....It is like Jesus Himselfspeaking to my heart and soul with His love...Truly uplifting!!
5,AWESOME,"This book was a birthday gift to me. It is as if Jesus is speaking directly to me. It is awesome. It has been such a blessing to me, I have gifted it to others."
4,Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence,"I bought this devotional because I like to do one each year. Though I did not know my circumstances in life would change so drastically at the time of purchase, most of the daily readings have been hitting right home in my present situation.I also like the fact you can read it in a minute, look up references and then take as long as you want to meditate & pray.My only criticism is that sometimes the scriptures referenced are a bit of a stretch or not taken in full context.Overall I would recommend this book."
5,Speaks to me directly,God speaks to me through Sarah Young's writing. Each day's devotional speaks directly to an issue or concern I am having in my life. I have bought this book for everyone in my life because it is so powerful. I want to get the kindle version now!
1,Not for a true Christian to even entertain,"While I see why a seeker would be interested in this, and unfortunately likely be led very astray, a true believer would recognize immediately that God speaks to them only through His word. While books can open our eyes and help us to take our relationship with Him deeper, they themselves cannot connect us with The One and only Truth. Tim Challies has an excellent review on his blog is you want more specifics. Belongs on the heresy shelf..."
5,Sara Young's words seem inspired by the spirit,This devotional is a little different than some because it brings to our attention something very important for Christians to know.It's how we manage our minds and our thoughts moment by moment that makes the difference between success and failure in our spiritual lives and realizing the blessings that are there for us right here and now through Him who died for us on a cross.
5,Wonderful!,"The best daily devotional I have ever seen. It pulls you in, provides support and direction, brings each day into focus. Helps you participate in each day, staying out of the past and being clouded by what may happen in the future."
4,A good book,This book deserves all the good things said about it. I hope all the readers pick it up and enjoy the read!
5,Jesus Calling,I have purchased several dozen of these after receiving mine as a gift in 2012 I highly recommend these devotionals for anyone who wishes to draw closer to the Lord in their daily readings. Thank you for making them affordable
4,Jesus calling- deluxe edition,I enjoy the daily readings a lot. I wish this particular edition had the bookmark the hardcover comes with. The daily readings contain a message that allow me to let go of the mental holdings and relax into what is.
5,inspiring,"I love the contents of this book. Beyond the contents thebook is a nice size to hold, good for an older person, notbig and heavy. Also, the print is easy to read, a good sizeand color. I would reccommend it to everyone."
5,Balm for the Soul,"I have found this book to be just what I need to help me move through this life. The words are direct but comforting and help me to keep my focus on what it needs to be on. I find that I can let go of many fears and much anxiety after I read the daily readings. I highly recommend this book and hope you find it to be the balm for your soul, as well."
3,Jesus Calling,"Some one had given me the book of Jesus Calling and I love it. I ordered it for my daughter, but somehow got a CD instead. I hate that I did that as she cannot look up the scripture that is referenced as she reads. But the book is wonderful."
5,Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence,"Excellent, uplifting, insightful daily readings. Written as if God Himself is speaking. Easy to read and to apply to one's everyday life."
5,Listening to Jesus Christ,I have the book and purchased several to give as gifts because it is an excellent way to interpret the holy word as Jesus speaking directly to you.
5,Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence,I have loved the hardback copy of this book for several months now. It is so much better to have it with me electronically on my Kindle. I would love to give this to all of my loved ones who need to really hear Jesus' voice calling.
5,A Must Buy,This book was given to me as a gift. I can't stress enough how much everybody needs this book. I have since bought numerous copies of this book for family and close friends.
5,New reader...non church goer,"I am not a church goer. This devotional was given to me by a friend last year. I often say as I walk my dog ""I talk to God"". This book gives me a lift every day. I read it every morning. It's the shot in the arm I need. It allowsme to reflect through the day. I have given the book to a few friends who seem to be at a crossroads. I ask them to please read these two small paragraphs daily. I'm certain many would enjoy this easy read. Reflect as you'd like ."
5,AWESONE!,I bought this book for myself and have since been purchasing it for friends and relatives. It is awesome!
5,Love it,"Such a great reminder that we can faithfully trust in our Lord, even in the times of trials. Also a great reminder of the comfort and peace we can find in Him alone"
5,Excellent,Jesus Calling is an excellent devotional. A quick and to the point message everyday with scripture references. I also have it on my Kindle and the actual scriptures are included at the end of each devotional reading. Well done.
5,Beautiful book to strengthen your relationship with our Lord,This book has become my signature gift to people who want to become closer to God or who are going through difficult times in their life.
5,Great daily devotional,A friend recommended the book to me. I love it. It is a great way to start my day. I also purchased extra books to give as gifts. There is a message for everyone.
4,"Great tangos, but not interpreted as such","When I bought this CD, I knew already what to expect - I am a long-time fan of Óscar Chávez, and had heard some of the tangos already. The presentation of the album is top-level, with the full lyrics and a good explanation of the sociopolitical circumstance that led to them being prohibited. Now, however good a singer Óscar is, he and his musicians... Are not tango interpreters. Most songs sound as his other Latinamerican songs.But the CD is still very much worth having!"
2,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"I've only worn these slippers inside the house (tiled and carpeted)since I got them at the end of April this year. The bottoms are rubber and the back heel edge is already wearing through on both slippers. Much too soon ! Yes, I am disappointed."
1,Poor quality - poor customer service,"I have been buying this same brand of slippers for my dad each Christmas, and he normally gets a full year of wear out of them. This year I purchased them from an Amazon seller for the first time, and they did not hold up. After only three months, the leather completely peeled off one side of the left slipper. I contacted the seller for a replacement, but was told that it was more than 60 days since they were purchased so they could not replace or refund. I will go back to buying from Zappos in the future!"
5,L.B. Evans Black Men's Slippers,"Bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas. Boy, did he love these! The minute he tried them on he said it felt like he's been wearing them forever! So, so comfortable. Also, the quality is superior. A little expensive, but so worth it. Highly recommend this slipper."
2,Did not hold up,"I purchased these for my father less than a year ago based on the many positive reviews. They were used only indoors on carpeting, but the heels are now so worn that the interior of the shoe is beginning to peek through. I would not purchase them again."
4,Husband approved!,"Got these for my husband and he wears them all the time! I didn't think they were that special and the price seemed outrageous for slippers. However, when they arrived, I liked them too and since they make him happy, they are worth it!The leather is very supple and the slipper's padding is nice too. These are for in house wear, and I wouldn't recommend them for outside. My husband wears them with and without socks and hasn't made any complaints yet, which to me is a very big deal!I am sure that we will be ordering this brand again the next time he needs a new pair of slippers, very comfortable and classy."
5,Did she sell her soul to write this well?,"I admit to being insanely jealous of Lisa Carver. In the first place, she is getting a lot more sex than I am. In the second, she writes better than I do, too. Even though we grew up at opposite ends of the country (she in New Hampshire and me in Alabama), my own rural upbringing makes it easy for me to relate to her tales of the White Trash subculture. I know those K Marts and ''Lawrence Welk Show'' reruns too well. And what makes me even more jealous is that she has no formal training as a writer. She has only the hard-knocks experience of producing a 'zine. Her chapter on the difference between K Mart and Wal-Mart alone is worth the purchase price (even if I'm a Wal-Mart partisan, myself). The insanely brilliant discussion of the sado-masochistic undertones of Lawrence Welk is just an added bonus. I came away from ''Dancing Queen'' with a newfound respect for Trailer Trash -- even if I still have no intention of dating any."
3,Is this the cable I need for my Olympus digital camera?,"Trying to figure out whether this is the cable you need?Here's hoping the following excerpt from Olympus document entitled: ""DOCUMENT NUMBER 2039 -- EXTERNAL FLASH OR STROBES NOT FIRING WITH OLYMPUS CAMERAS"" may help you as it helped me!:Olympus Cameral Models: C-2040/3000/3030/3040 Zoom, C-2100/C-700 UZ and E-100RS:The above cameras utilize a 5-pin TTL connector for the external flash connection. The 5-pin TTL connector is designed to control the Olympus FL-40 dedicated flash unit (p/n 200596). To use the FL-40 with these cameras, the optional Olympus FL-CB01 cable (p/n 200 664) and FL-BK01 flash bracket (p/n 200 666) must be used.The 5-pin TTL connector can also control a PC Sync flash or strobe system by using the optional FL-CB04 flash cable (p/n 200 661). Since this type of flash/strobe is non-dedicated, the photographer will need to manually match the flash output with the camera."
5,WOW. A storyteller in our midst,"The characters, whether good guys/girls or bad (and sometimes it is hard to tell who is which) are beautifully presented. The reader cares about them, while knowing an inevitable conflict looms to explode their lives and their community. Lyrical, terse writing meshes with a dramatic, tense plot to keep the reader engrossed. What a find!"
5,What a find!,"It's always a treat to find a writer who can tell a good story, but to discover one who can also weave magic with words is doubly so. But perhaps what struck me most was the author's social vision, not a simple idealistic dream or a cynic's rant but a carefully crafted picture of the complexities of life in our multicultural society. An excellent read."
5,Great for a Halloween costume!,Purchased these ears for a Halloween costume. They are durable and fit nicely on an adult.
2,Choose another pair of bunny ears,"I know these are just an inexpensive novelty item, but they should be better than they are. The plastic support inside one ear was not attached to the headband upon arrival, and the plastic inside is black. You can see it through the fabric. There were several to choose from on Amazon when I bought these and if I'd seen them in person, I would have chosen another pair."
3,CENTERFOLD MEN 2,"Totally waste of money. Don't buy it because no love scene, just good looking guys posing, exercising, and sleeping. They're not even masturbating."
1,Slow........,"Although tastefully done, I found this CD to be slow and not able to hold my attention.I would use this video to get someone whom you're interested in being with possibly in the mood.It's not he most erotic Gay CD I've seen. Men aren't that "" HOT "" and scenes short in duration with a lot of repeat scenes."
3,Centerfold men 2,"It was kind of short. I think the edition is good and the photographs great. I would not recommend it, though"
2,This is SO much money! Try OpenOffice before buying,"...If you're an intense Access or Excel macro user, you might want to go with this.Anyone else can get go to openoffice.org and download that office suite instead. Or get StarOffice here. You can do so many of the same things. Open or create Word files, do all the stuff you can do in Word, save'em back as Word format or not. Make web pages. Do mail merges, hooked up to any database you want. Do presentations. Impress is the PowerPoint equivalent and reads those file formats. It's got good effects and animation. Do all the spreadsheets you want. The Excel equivalent handles Excel formats and lets you save back out in that format or not.And the openoffice and staroffice file sizes are tiny. If you've ever been really annoyed by bloated MS Office file sizes, you are going to love openoffice or staroffice. Really small files.Put the money in your 401k. Skip MS Office."
5,"This is the, er... stuff!","I agree with D. Moritz - this is the best. I originally got into latin music through Trios Los Panchos and the ""Boleros"" genre that they did so well, but for the past few years Huasteco has really grabbed me. Relentless, pounding, dissonant, and soaring, simultaneously dark and light, it's an amazing musical style. And as D. Moritz says, I don't think anyone does it better than Xoxocapa. I wish more was available from this incredible group. Amazon has Sones Huastecos 3 and IV, so where's 2? And is there a 1?"
5,Beautiful Bracelet!!!,"I've had this bracelet for a week and I absolutely love it. It lays on my wrist well and is really easy to use the sterling silver hook to put it on and take it off. I've searched here on Amazon for this type of bracelet as well as ebay, Overstock, and various on-line sites and this is by far the best bracelet and at the best price. It shipped out quickly and the sellers sent me another bracelet with the one I ordered as a free gift."
3,Entertaining But Limited,"Pros:A very detailed and technical section on strokes.Enjoyable reading.Cons:Dated.Much information specific to ""British"" kayaking.Not a single mention of how to tie a knot.Many nautical terms not defined."
5,It gets better every time I hear it....,"Clean & intelligent - this CD's definitely worth a listen. If you're lucky enough to live near Seattle, these guys are incredible live!"
3,New thresholds of faith,the book was good but a bit on the dirty (not clean) side and was not at all as this picture shows. It looked very old
4,New Threshold of Faith,I was happy with the fast response from Amazon and from the vendor that I ordered my merchandise from. And I was very satisfied with the product I purchased. A great book to read. Thank you.
4,Nice inexpensive moisturizer,"I'm trying a couple of different moisturizers because I don't really see a difference in my skin with Cerave. This one smells nice, has a sunscreen and is not too heavy. If anything, it might be too light for those of us who experience various skin conditions in the winter. Good for the price."
5,Great product!,"The shipping was fast and it was in good condition when I got it. I can't rave enough about how much I love this face lotion! It's light and it sinks in quickly, leaving you without any build up within seconds. Protects daily against the sun. Great!"
3,Nice feel but too much fragrance,"Not sure why everything needs to be so perfumed these days. I would especially expect a product advertised as 'natural' to be just that, natural w/o perfumes. Not the case. I won't buy it again just because of that factor."
2,For me,I do not know. I think I just do not like the feel of this product on my face. I have worn it a couple of times and can not get use to it.
1,The Worst Amazon Buy,"I am very disappointed with this buy, because i received a half empty tube, dirt and dried up lotion all over it and the box. It was sold as ""New."" It EXPIRED 4 month ago, in August 2010. I don't even know if it was refilled with something other than alba lotion. So go figure."
5,Great daily moisturizer!,"I love this moisturizer! I have oily, sensitive skin, and this moisturizer is perfect for the daytime. A little dab goes a long way, it absorbs quickly, and it has a light, pleasant fragrance. Whats not to love? :)"
3,Alba Sea Moss spf 15 review,"I should have gotten a moisturizer with a higher SPF (30-50), but this one will do on overcast and rainy days. It looks like sunscreen (texture and color wise) but smells good. It keeps my face moisturized for several hours so I don't need to re-apply it constantly."
2,Should have listened to Amazon reviews,Read reviews about how fast the ear pads wore out. Should have paid more attention. Mine developed a small hole the first time I wore them.There were other issues as well. These were not a keeper for me.Pros- Decent sound quality- in-line volume control- comfortableCons- Ear pads fragile- Volume control heavy and moved around a lot while walking- Adjusting volume caused static. Concerned that this might fail at some point.Going with 2 stars not 1 as some user might have their own ear pads or just not care about the pads.
2,Too bad.,"I find these headphones very comfortable to wear, but after only 3 days, the foam ear covers began to shred and are now completely missing."

5,Great humor,"Situational humor from start to finish, with a lovable character that has you rooting for him all along the way. A great read anytime.J. Peter Yakel, Author, The Legend of Juggin Joe"
4,Flower Gardening 1-2-3,I bought this book for my son who is a landscaper This gives him helpful information for his business. He can look up what type of plant will go with the clients landscape and also is used as a good reference guide. The price was very good too and I saved on time and money by saving on gas driving from bookstore to bookstore to find the perfect book and time by looking at the books content in the comfort of my home.
1,Elegant doorstop,"Worked fine until just past the one-year warranty's expiration, when it just died. Wouldn't turn on, nothing. An expensive mistake that I won't make again."
4,All is not lost.,"My Maxtor died with many hours of good stuff on it.Think, think, think.I had an old 85GB installed in one of the case-only sold by Amazon, so ---Installed the Maxtor into the case-only instead and --- all was well.It wasn't the hard drive that failed, it was the Maxtor case.Simple solution, no-brainer to install. Case has a switch, lights and is quiet, no overheating."
1,It's junk!,I purchased one of these drives a year ago and it has worked well so I bought another one 6 months ago. Within a couple of weeks it began being very noisy and it got noisier each week so I send it back to Seagate. The replacement was noisy from day one on start up but would get quiet after a minute or two so I kept using it. Two weeks late it failed and I lost about 160GB of video. I called Seagate and requested that they do data recovery free of charge and send me a different model. The answer was an unconditional NO to both requests. Just for the fun of it I send in the failed drive and received a replacement two days ago. This morning on start up it was making the by now familiar mechanical noise. I won't bother to send this one back since by now not only did I spend the $200 plus for the drive but an additional approximately $60 to ship the three defective units back and at best they would just send me another one that would fail.
4,500 Gigs at a reasonable Price,"BACKUP - BACKUP - BACKUP. Don't blame me if you lose your data. That's what I tell my clients if they don't listen to me and backup their data. It's as easy as pusshing a button before leaving the office or going to sleep. What could be easier.Should you also make a DVD of your important data and place it in a safe offsite. Yes, but that is what my clients hire me for. You should do both. The DVD's can be done every once in a while, but the usb attached storage can be performed whenever you have changed data that needs backing up.Just Do It!."
3,Good drive; bad software,"This drive has huge amounts of space on it and works well when used for backups and storage programs included with Windows XP. However, the person who designed the included software package should be tortured to death and his/her remains thrown to the dogs. If you are looking for a lot of space, this is your drive. Just do yourself a favor and don't even look at the enclosed software. You'll thank me later."
1,No customer service...,I am writing this review as I pass minute 42 of being on hold with Seagate customer service. The installation CD arrived without the Mac software and no phone number to call for help. After a week of waiting on the web request I was sent a link to download the software. Once downloaded the software would not install with out a license code. After another day of waiting I got an email giving me a phone number to call for the license code. After initially being told that Maxtor didn't support the Mac I now continue to wait on hold with the faint hope that eventually I will talk with someone who can actually help me and I will be able to use this drive.
1,Attractive drive but incredibly unreliable,"I purchased this external hard drive because I've always liked my 250 GB Maxtor One Touch although it gets a lot hotter than the physically larger Western Digital drive I own. I was hoping to use the 500 GB Maxtor One Touch III to backup 3 computers. Unfortunately it failed in the first week. Maxtor (Seagate) replaced it with a ""refurbished"" drive that was DOA. Replacing the ""refurbished"" drive will take several more weeks, and I'm wondering if I could trust another ""refurbished"" drive."
1,Died in just five weeks,"The drive died just five weeks after purchase. The minimum cost for data recovery was $1400 in 4-6 weeks, and started at $2400 or more for faster service. Seagate/Maxtor will replace the item with a...refurbished drive.Sayonara Seagate/Maxtor. You'll get no more business from me!"
2,Not a reliable product,"I am currently into one year with my drive bought from Fry's electronics. The Maxtor is starting to make more grinding noise and vibrations from a cold start up ... being switched off a period of four days.This was a cheap drive and seem to be a bargain, but if you use the HD to back up data ... then make sure this Maxtor has something to back it up for sure. Don't use it as a final reliable back up device. Spend the money and get something built to server quality. Not the Maxtor products."
1,Do not buy this product.,Do not buy this product. My first Maxtor failed after three months. The replacement was free but did not work due to a bum drive. The second replacement was free as well but the replacement should have been sent to Europe and the power supply is incompatible with US requirements. The service and product have been very poor. I would like a cash reimbursement for the postage and time spent on this. As well as a reimbursement to purchase a storage device from a different company.
2,Noisy drive,"I've had this drive for 3 months. I've stored around 28GB of data on it and last week it started making that tell-tale noise of a head crash. It still works but I hear that noise several times a day. I immediately backed all the data on it up to another drive and contacted Seagate about the warranty. Their website lets you request an RMA so you can return it for replacement with no questions asked, but from other reviews I don't expect a replacement that will last very long. I'm researching what drive to buy and it looks like it won't be Maxtor (Seagate). I've always had good luck with Western Digital - maybe I'll go with them."
3,Inside your horse.,"A wonderful mag on diseases, chronic problems, basic health and nutrition for your horse. Not much on the conservation of the horse, future of the horse or current practices of the horse. But great for health."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR HORSE PEOPLE,"This magazine is a must have for anyone who loves horses and wants to learn more about their care. Highly educational and enjoyable. As an Equine Science student, this magazine augments my studies."
5,Equus as needed as an apple-picker for horse owner,Equus magazine provides quality information on horse health plus other equine related topics. I have subscribed for several years and purchased subscriptions for my daughter and a couple of horse owning friends. Each issue has valuable information. I file my read issues.E. Eagly D.V.M.
5,equis,great information my daughter and i enjoy it .took a little longer then what was told for delivery but worth the wait.js
4,For All Thoses That Still Owe Tapes......,It was so hard to find this product in the stores. But one sales clerk refered me to this site ans here is where I found it! I'm glad to have it so I can clean my fathers tape player like it needs to be done.
1,Cleaning fluid container was cracked,"This product arrived from High N Low Trading with a cracked cleaning fluid container, and all the fluid long gone and dried up. It was functionally worthless, and not worth the cost to ship it back for a refund. I might consider buying one again, but not from High N Low Trading."
1,Cleaning Tape,I used the cleaning tape in my truck and it didn't work. It was a waste of money to order it.
3,I am not sure if it cleaned,"I did not have any problem using it but my cassette player (in car) is still showing ""clean player"" message. It is playing the tapes as before and I cannot tell any difference in sound quality, but I should say that the quality was never that bad. I used this product because the player started showing me that message and that problem is not solved. I really don't know whether the cleaner did not do its job or simply my player is faulty (or have other issues)."
1,I wish I knew whether this would work....,"I haven't been able to use this product for it's intended purpose because the fluid is completely impossible to get out of the bottle, so far as I can tell. The bottle is so small and so stiff that it can't be squeezed. No amount of shaking or gravity seems to be able to pull the fluid out, either. Even if it were an issue of just squeezing hard enough, it'd be impossible to squeeze that hard with one hand while holding the tape with the other. Total bust."
4,I enjoyed it from start to finish.,Very good book by Cassie Edwards. I have enjoyed every book she has written. END
1,Not worthy of HALF a star!!!,"I cannot believe that a book this poorly written, unintelligent and unrealistic would even be considered for publication. The dialogue in this pathetic excuse for a novel is simple and dull, the plot is ridiculous and unimaginative, and the characters are childish and unintelligent. The only reason I even finished this book is so I could claim to have read the stupidest book ever written. I'm starting to wonder if my pain and suffering was worth it."
1,ummmm....boring?,"OK, I usually like this author, but this was a ridiculous book. I really can't bring myself to finish it yet, although I'm nearly done, because this book was, well, just not so great. And my standards for light fiction are low. A whiny crying sniveling-but-perky and ignorant heroine who eats all the time. Everyone is rich. All plot issues are resolved without much work. A waste of my time."
3,Enjoyable with a slight annoying touch,"I love Ms. Davidson's books. They have humor, they're sexy and great romance. The only thing I did not like about this book was how very naive Stephanie was and it was pretty ridiculous that she and Eric were afraid to say ""I love you."" Good grief they were all over each other, what do three little words mean when it should have been obvious how they both felt. But it was the heroine's actions that were really hard to take. How could anyone living in the 21st century be so unaware of what men and women do in bed. These flaws gave the book 3 stars otherwise I would have given it 5."
5,Sweet little charm,"I owned a Jack Russell Terrier named Scarlett for over 15 years. Sadly she passed away. When I wear my little gold charm, I think of her. I love it!"
1,Don't buy these headphones,"It's difficult to tell from the photograph, but the actual speaker on these headphones is quite bulky, and would not fit into my ear, leaving the headphone jutting out at unlistenable and uncomfortable angle.The rings in varying sizes included for adjustability cannot fix the fit problem, and, at least for me, added another one; they are flimsy and snap in so tight that when I attempted to change a ring, it broke off, leaving a tab stuck in the slot so that no other rings could be inserted.From the little testing I managed, the sound quality was also not impressive. In short, do NOT buy these headphones; while not ill-conceived, they are poorly designed and flimsily made."
1,Don't buy unless you want to be part of the class action lawsuit,"Purchased two separate units, both of which have failed in exactly the same way as detailed in the CNET discussion forms. Works for a few months, and then one day *poof* your data is no longer accessible. It's not a coincidence - it's a crappy, flawed product which is eventually going to have a class actions suit filed (as evidenced by the Sklar lawfirm's website and numerous discussion boards)."
4,Maxtor 300 GB,"The Maxtor has been graet for back up files. The software that came with is not as good ,but is usable for most people."
1,Died after 8 months - lost all my files,"My 320GB external OneTouch III maxtor drive failed. I have lost my life's work for trusting the namebrand Maxtor. Seagate bought them out. So far, Seagate can replace my drive but cannot recover my files free of charge. In fact, they charge $1,400 to do so. Therefore, I have had to resort to joining a possible class action lawsuit. Be forewarned - there are no guarantees for any hard drive on the market. If you must get this particular drive I highly recommend backing it up to DVD or another drive as often as possible, unless you intend to use the drive for temprary scratch files such as video editing, which it is capable of doing so with the extremely fast data transfer speeds, given its 16MB cache. I experienced 40 megs per second transfer rates at times. Overall, I do not recommend this particular hard drive due to reliablity issues."
2,Gets the job done,It's your basic compact flash/PCMCIA adapter card. Great for laptops when all you want to do is transfer digital pictures from your compact flash to your laptop.Too bad this an Office Depot product that you can't pick up in the store. The shipping alone pretty much kills this product as a good deal.
1,This book was a disappointment -- not enough useful info.,"While home exchange sounds like a great idea, this book gives very little practical information on how to arrange it. If the information is buried within the numerous, rambling accounts by previous home exchangers, I missed it - probably because I was too bored and irritated to read every word of their very personal and detailed accounts of their vacations. Good grief, I just wanted to know the legal protections, if any, tips on finding suitable matches, etc.I believe this author has enough expertise to craft a quality book on the subject of home exchange."
1,"Very general overview. Lots of anecdotes, little info.","I got the book before my 1st home exchange (which was GREAT!). I found it to be very shallow. Lots of little stories, but little useful info. Sorry, but not recommended."
3,NICE SLIPPER,I bought these for my Father and he say there super comfortable and my Mother is so glad that has stylish slipper to replace the old battleships that he use to wear.
1,NO LONGER MADE IN THE USA...NOW MADE IN CHINA,"I had bought several pairs of Evans Deer Slippers over a dozen years. They were made in the USA and wore real nice. This last pair I bought for $75 started falling apart after 6 mos. The piping became delaminated showing an ugly dark grey woven chord. The fluffy inside wore out even sooner, flattening out to nothing after a while. The rubber sole started coming unglued and cracked. Very disappointed at the quality control and I will not buy Evans anymore until they are made in the USA again."
4,soft and comfy,"A good-looking, comfortable slipper. My only reservation is that the size 12 I ordered was a tiny bit smaller than a 12 usually is."
2,Quality Decline,I have bought this slipper for several years. This newest one has started to flake off the brown surface coating of the leather piping.
1,"Bald interior, stiff exterior","The acrylic ""fur"" on the inside is too thin, so the slippers are definitely NOT cozy.Even after several weeks of wear to break them in, the stiff outsole does not flex enough, so every time I take a step my heel comes out of the back of the slippers and when I step down, it's on the bent over back of the deerskin upper.Nice-looking, but worst slippers I've ever bought."
3,Didn't quite grab me,"I absolutely loved Plants and Birds, and liked Interbabe Concern. This outing hasn't really found its way into my pantheon of greats...there are some decent tracks, but everything feels slightly bitty, with hard pointy edges and little flow, at both the level of individual tracks and the album as a whole. I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for the Family."
2,Doesn't do the job,"I purchased this particular disk cleaner based on the reviews I read. It cost a little more but I know Maxell to be a good brand. The directions are not clear enough for me - they assume you already understand how the thing works. Then, I couldn't get it to work. It was supposed to go in and then start talking. Of the 4 slots I tried it in it only worked inone AND it wouldn't come out without tweezers that scratched the disk. I have a Bose player withthe extra disk player which is a very good machine. I had some minor problems with one slot and I was assured the cleaner would take care of it. I never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything. I am afraid to put it in anything for fear I won't be able to get it out again. I don't know if this was a problem with my player but some disclaimer about not working with some players should be added more clearly and should list the brands it doesn't work with."
2,Ineffective,"I tried this with a CD-ROM player that was not recognizing the CD. Initially it seemed to help a little bit. But the problem returned quite soon. So I tried using the cleaner again, I think three times in a row. The problem really never went away."
3,Lens cleaner,Evidently my cd drive is not spinning which is what is causing my cd's to not play so I really don't know if this product works
4,Runs on my player when others didn't,"This one actually ran in my dvd player/writer, when it rejected a similar cleaner. I can't tell if it does what it says yet. I let it run for a few minutes, since my dvd player has been skipping with a certain movie. And now I've forgotten which disc has the problem, so I can't test it out."
1,CD Laser Cleaner,This did not work on our cd player or dvd player and we could not get any of our cd's or dvd's to work until we bought a new cd player and tv/dvd player.
4,Doesn't Beat the Badger Brush,"While this is a great product, I enjoy using myMerkur Futur 4 Piece Shaving Set - Polished Finish-#751- Made in Germanywith a badger brush. My prefered shave is a pre-shave oil Anthony Logistics Pre-Shave Oil and then application of a rich cream Proraso Eucalyptus & Menthol Shaving Cream 150 ml.. With that said for quick(er) shave, or when you are traveling and don't want to take a brush, oil and cream -- this stuff is great -- smooth shave with total convenience."
5,Great Costume,"This was a great fit for my 5 year old, and the material was better quality than I expected. My son had lots of fun and was comfortable all day at school...Worth the cost.Thanks"
2,Short,"The pants part of the outfit are very short. i bought it for my 10 year old for his sience project and planed on him using as a halloween costume, but it is too short now, there is no way it will fit him by October. So it was a very expensive outfit that was worn for about 30 min.Not overly happy with that."
5,Great!,"Very pleased with this item. It fit well and was sized well and very sharp looking. My son wore it to a Halloween party and got grass stains, frosting and some chocolate smeared on it. I was worried that it would be stained forever, but I followed the washing instructions and it came out good as new! It's so cute, he'll get to wear it again next year if he doesn't grow too tall by then!"
4,Future Astronaut Approved,"I bought this for my ""future astronaut"" for his 8th birthday. He loves it and wears it frequently while playing. He even wore it for his birthday party. (A space theme, what else?) He was rough on it, but it held up and washed beautifully.When we received this, the flag patch was upside down. The manufacturer sent us a call tag on Friday and the new one arrived on Monday! They were wonderful to work with."
3,Nice looking but tore on first use,"First time we put the costume on my son the crotch tore about 3 inches. We didn't have time to return it before Halloween so we just sewed it back and used some safety pins for extra measure. It ""looked"" great and everyone loved it but for the price I expected better quality."
5,Fantastic!,"This looks great and is of high quality. I bought the 4/6 size and it fit my slight 4year old son (he normally wears size 3) and was a snug fit on my tall 6 year old daughter. Even though the legs were too long for my son, there are Velcro straps around the ankles which keep the cuffs off the floor and means it fits great. Highly recommended."
5,very nice,"My son is very happy, so do I. A good choice, good quality, good price. A good present for kids."
5,Perfect for learning about and pretending to be an astronaut,"Exactly what my 4yo son wanted. We got it for Halloween but he has had a fantastic time dressing up in it and pretending to be an astronaut. It has facilitated his learning about space travel, our solar system, and different jobs."
5,Perfect!,"This is by far the cutest Halloween costume I have ever seen. My 2 year old son LOVES IT! We are going to see the shuttle launch right after Halloween, so we thought this would be perfect. I searched for days to find the one I liked the best. This is very good quality, the patches are real and the material is perfect for a south florida trick or treating night. It's thin enough that he won't sweat too bad, but still good quality. It is true to size as well!"
4,Great overall costume,This costume is a very good quality. The only negative is it runs small. I would say the size 12/14 fits more like a 10/12.
2,Astronaut's Suit Fabric A Disappointment,"Some of the detailing is good. However, the fabric used was very thin, transparent and not durable. For that price, I would expect some kind of vinyl material which would make the suit look more authentic. My daughter had to wear a white outfit underneath because you can see through the cheap cotton fabric. What a disappointment."
5,Out of This World,"Great buy... Suit was such good qaulity. A little pricey, almost didn't buy it but compared to all others on the market it was far better. True to size but I got a size larger so he can enjoy it for play for a few years. I washed it 3 times and it is good as new. (follow instructions)The hat is adorable too.I would reccommend it definately!"
5,wow great quality,great quality. Well hemmed. Patches are sewn on and really my 3 yr old could walk into NASA and start working ! I purchased this for Halloween but he has worn it 8 days and it is holding up very well. Buy the talking helmet too....it is worth it !
5,Great Costume!,We bought this Jr. Astronaut Suit for our son's Halloween costume. We visited Kennedy Space Center last spring and he was very excited about the space program. He is 8 years old and the costume is a great fit! And looks very authentic. He can't wait to wear it!
2,Astroaut Suit,"My grandson needed a astronaut Suit for a school project he was Neil Armstrong. The suit looked nice on him, but it was a one time thing. It is nothing he will ever use again."
5,ASTRONAUT SUIT REVIEW,"The product is awesome, well made and it looks great. My son loved it and it was a real hit. Especially when we added the helmet (additional product purchased seperately on amazon) It looks authentic and there was no other child with the same costume so it was a real crowd pleaser. One note: If your child is close in size and you are not sure pick the larger size. My child was almost too small for it. The legs have velcro at the bottom so you can adjust the fit."
4,Adorable and realistic,The size definitely runs in the middle of the zone. A 6-8 is more like a 7X. The suit and shoe covers were very nice for the price and my son loved them. He wore them for several days after they first arrived.
5,Excellent Costume,"This is by far the best Halloween costume I have purchased. It is a great fit for my almost 5 year old and looks authentic. It is costly but seems to be a good value, given the quality construction and details. I also bought the space helmet and returned it, since it is too big and has few features."
3,Good but not great,I bought this costume for my son to wear to school for future career day. It seemed really well made and was a very cute costume. It looks just like the picture and was what I expected it to look like. The only problem with it was the seams were not sewed together real well and my son didn't make it half the day before the sides busted out. I'm going to try to sew it back together but it's ripped pretty bad. I like the costume just don't think I'd pay the 40+ dollars for it again.
5,Great Astronaut Costume!,This is a great costume for any little kid who wants to be an astronaut. Just because the US isn't doing shuttle missions anymore doesn't mean kids can't dress up like their dream career! This is wonderfully detailed and even has NASA patches.
5,a great costume,It is well made and seems very durable. The three zippers on the leg are all for one pocket. It does not come with shoes. The strap across the waste unbuckles. The two straps on each side unbuckle. The four paches are well made and sewn on well too. The hat is well made like a normal baseball cap.written by Zachary
4,"Good quality, looks great","After reading the rave reviews on this site, I was a little disappointed to find the fabric not be as heavy-guage as I'd expected, and it seemed see-through, but once on it was great and not as see-though as I'd feared.It looks absolutely great on my 3.5 yr-old. I should point out that he is just growing into a 4T, and this fits him about the same as most of those things, maybe just slightly larger, so buyer beware. If your child is larger than a 4T (maybe a small 5), get the next size up.He really looks like an astronaut, very professional and he loves all the patches. I love that it will last past Halloween and provide dress-up fun. It is definitely decent quality and would last as part of a normal wardrobe if your kid, like mine, seems to want to wear it every day.Oh, and the hat is also ok quality and looks good, and could be worn alone as a regular hat. A bonus!"
5,Great quality and fast shipping,"The costume is better than I expected and the shipping was amazingly fast. It is an exact fit for a size 8, so he will be giving it to his little brother after wearing it."
5,awesome for the beginner astronaut,"I bought this for my 4 year old son, Tre, and he absolutely loves it. It is going to be his halloween costume but he wants to put it on every day and get into his imaginary space shuttle and do the countdown on his mission to Pluto, he says he doesn't care what the other scientists say he still believes Pluto is a planet and he's going there to prove it. I would recommend it in a heartbeat."
5,Just like a real astronaut,"I bought this astronaut suit for my son for Halloween. Not only did he where it on Oct. 31st, but he was a little astronaut for months after! It is very good quality and has a nice fitting. I would recommend this product."
2,Size 6 - 8 Too small for my 6 year old,"This is a great product. The material is fairly thick (unlike the adult version), it is well made and looks great. My only problem with it was the size. Other reviews stated that it fitted 7 year olds well. The hat is really well made and could be used for everyday use. The price reflects the quality and is worth it for the costume to last. I would have given it 5 stars but my son is average height, but it barely fits him and we got it for a gift on his 6th birthday. We are reordering the next size up."
2,poor stitching,"This is a poor quality costume. My son wore it twice (around 15 minutes each time) for presentation rehearsal for school and the side leg just ripped. If I had more choices, I would have looked into it but it looked like this particular costume ""looked"" the best and my son was Neil Armstrong for his school presentation."
5,super cute costume,"We got this costume for my son. He's 22 months and it fits him very well... It's a little big but you don't notice that...The material is durable, it's very well done."
5,"Native Tongues, Portland Stylee?","If you love the campy vibe of Seventies Blaxploitation movies, or the goofy humor of the first De La Soul album, or concept albums in general, this new Lifesavas joint is highly recommended. Portland, Oregon is a now-practically-legendary creative mecca for independent music -- anything goes, boundaries between genres are porous, rent is cheap, so many of the most exciting artists working today are based here: The Shins, The Decemberists, Modest Mouse, Laura Veirs, Stephen Malkmus, The Gossip, the late great Sleater-Kinney. Hopefully this album will bring the hip-hop side of the equation into the limelight as well. Portland is a pretty pale town, knowutimsayin, so it's great that there's still such a vibrant hip-hop scene here.Check it out -- this is the party album of Summer '007 -- it's a license to chill!"
4,Cool Watch,"I like the ease the you can change the face. The watch was clso easy to adjust the band size. I did think that the band would be wider. But, overall, it's a decent watch."
3,Alba a good summer cream,"This daily cream didn't work so well for me during the dry and winter seasons it left my skin sort of dry and chappy (skin peeling in dry areas). I do think that it is a suitable summer cream since I didn't have this same experience as the winter season. It claims that it has a large percent of organic ingredients makes it worth the summer ""use"" only for me. The product smells good and it is not oily."
4,Feels nice,"This cream feels very nice on my face and neck. It's not going to make me look younger and my skin doesn't glow after putting it on, but it feels great and I like the smell"
2,Scent too strong,Definitely a day cream. I was hoping I could use it as a night cream. But not moisturizing enough for winter. Scent is really strong and gives me a headache.
3,Smell is atrocious,"The cream feels nice and I like that it uses natural ingredients. It has a decent feel on my skin, not too heavy, but I just can't get past the smell. Sorry if I ruin this for anyone, but it needs to be said that it has the same scent as the scent they use to cover up the smell of an outdoor restroom (I know this because I just got back from a camping festival). :(I really like the cream, I just can't get past the smell. It lasts for a few hours until I can no longer smell it anymore. I'm wary of getting too close to my boyfriend when I have this on my face because I don't want him to smell it on me."
3,Not a heavy cream,"This is a very lite facial cream and the smell is not too bad. It goes on evenly and smooth and I imagine one could wear this under their make-up without it feeling heavy or greasy. A little bit of this does go a long way, perhaps a pea size or a bit larger is all one needs. Again, the smell is not bad, more crisp and clean smelling with a hint of perfume. After using this all up, I most likely won't purchase this again."
5,Love this product!,"Goes on so smooth and smells great and leaves my skin so soft - this is my new staple, already ordered another one! Love love love!"
3,not bad,"product is light, absorbs well, smells nice. not bad for the price, though it did make me break out a little bit. my skin is particularly sensitive, though."
3,Too much fragrance!,"All I notice about this product when I use it is how heavy the fragrance is. I suppose it's doing a decent job moisturizing because my skin does not feel dry (although it's August and humid, so who knows?). But, my goodness, the scent is so heavy that it's distracting. I feel like I'm putting some cheap garbage from Bath and Body Works on my face. Really wish Alba hadn't been so heavy handed with the ""parfum""."
5,Klingon Civil war,"Worf has resigned from starfleet to go and help prevent a klingon war from erupting. The Duros sisters are trying to take over the empire with the help of the Romulans.Picard, meanwhile, pursuades Star Fleet to help in the Civil war indirectly. Picard takes charge of a fleet of ships, and sets of blockcade at the Klingon-Romulan border, with tachyon beams suspended between each of the starships, and puts Data and Riker each in command of a starship, If a cloaked ship passes through the tachyon's, that ship will show up on sensors. As the Captain orders the fleet to move away, Data saves the day, by disobeying a direct order, and fires energy beams, uncovering Romulan Warbirds entering klingon space.Once discovered, the Romomulans retreat back to their space, deserting the Duross sisters. Once the sisters find they are abandoned they escape, and Worf helps Chancellor Gawron stay in power. Worf returns to duty on the Enterprise."
2,Stupid and totally predictable!,"The writers of Star Trek TNG cleverly find a way to bring back Lt. Yar (well, her daughter anyways) and then totally misuse the potential. As with many of the season finales, this one is a good story yet nothing really great. Even the ""Borg taking Picard"" season finale was made into a disappointment,with everything wrapped up neatly at the conclusion of the second part of the episode so that the series goes on as always. The writers of this series certainly didn't ""Boldly Go"" anywhere in the majority of this show's run.My suggestion- don't buy this- it's probably on today anyways on the reruns. Save your money instead and use it on one of the Lord of the Rings dvd's."
4,Decent Toothpaste,"The one thing I don't like about this toothpaste is tastes terrible and if you don't rinse your mouth out well it leaves a gritty residue in your mouth. Otherwise, it does leave your teeth and mouth feeling pretty fresh after using it. I don't use it often enough to know how well the whitening formula really works because I use a lot of different brands of toothpaste but overall I'd rate this product highly."
1,incorrect listing (per Fogdog),"Don't buy these, this deal which states $3.99/dozen is incorrect, it is per ball. Speaking from experience"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"What you get is not what is in the description. It says that you are buying a ""One Dozen"" balls, but they only shipped me one ball."
2,They serve a purpose,"Bought these balls for winter baseball practice. They have tiny wrinkles on the covers. Not a high quality ball, but they are serving a purpose."
5,awesome,"exactly as described. I ordered 3 dozen, minor imperfections on a few balls but perfect for training. the wilson A1030's have nothing on these balls."
4,"Useful, but perhaps a bit biased","I recently spent 3 1/2 months in Australia as a student, and I took this guide along for the few weeks I had to travel around. Everywhere I went, this guide pointed out pleasant places that ordinary travel guides might not bother with. The lists of accomodation and restaurants in every city or town were especially useful. Interspersed throughout are historical and cultural notes that allow the visitor to enjoy each place just a little bit more, and Gareth Powell's dry wit makes the guide very readable. My one disappointment was the comparative lack of attention to Brisbane (where I spent most of my time). For instance, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Perth all have detailed, color street maps at the back of the book, but Brisbane does not. Overall, however, this guide was well worth its price."
2,Boring,"I didn't care all that much for this movie. Its a superficial look at being a widow and remarriage. Unless you are a fan of the actors I'd give this one a pass.As far as performances I really can't say too much positive about any of them. Bachchan has played this role a million times before and has done so better. Rani doesn't have the depth or the sensitivity to portray these types of characters. My opinion of her performance here is the same as with KANK. I don't find myself sympathizing with her characters despite the bucketfull of tears she's shed in both roles. Salman was playing Salman. Seriously, why do directors keep casting him. His relationship with Rani's character had zero credibility with me. John Abraham was okay but besides looking good, he really doesn't bring much to the character. He can't even dance and that's a no no when your a Bollywood actor.Overall, this movie was one big dull experience."
5,Adult women and adult humor.,Finally a sitcom about adult women who act and talk like my adult friends when we get together for lunch.
5,can not wait to watch,we used to watch on television but the channel is no longer available to us and this will catch us back up.
5,Drawing Outdoors,"Drawing Outdoors is a very helpful book. I was especially interested in the detailed, energetic drawings that can be achieved with felt-tip pen. I have always enjoyed Henry Pitz's work, anyway. The book is well written. I found it to be motivating and enjoyable, building anticipation in me to want to get outdoors and sketch whatever looks interesting, finding the possibilities in each subject that appeals to me.I certainly enjoy Henry Pitz's methods of drawing trees. He gives them personality."
5,Amber Waves,"Was skeptical because it has one setting, but.... works great. Hair smooth and straight. Works wonderfully on ethnic hair. Not too hot... just right and dosen't damage hair."
3,"great for thin hair, does not work for course hair.",This product does not come highly recommended for women with thick hair. It does not provide nearly enough heat if your hair is course.. only recommended for short thin hair.
1,Worst Flat Iron I have ever used.,"Simple does not work. Maybe I received a unit that does not get hot enough or maybe it has something to do with the plates, but the product did not straighten hair. I have had many brands and irons over the years and this was the worst. Either way there is not a heat setting to adjust so for me this was useless. I ended up returning the product."
5,All I can say is cute...,"This little dog shirt is absolutely adorable. I also purchased one as a gift for a friend with a pug. The fabric is lightweight and washes well. Seems to be very comfortable for the dog to wear, too."
2,Interesting film,"But that's about all you can say. Yes, it makes its point 3000 times over, that's easy to see, but it's also sloppy. It can't decide if it wants to be softcore porn or slasher film, and in the end fails on both counts. Most characters are too caricateurish to be taken even half-seriously. The whole thing just doesn't hold up as a solid story. The poorly-translated subtitles provide some unintentional laughs."
4,Riordan Gets it much better,"This time Becka and Scott, and Ryan, too, are off to New Mexico to help a young Native American in a fight against demons, evil, and misunderstanding. This could be their toughest assignment ever and one of them may fall.James Riordan does a much better job with this one (yes, he is the author and not Bill Myers). Very little in the way of facts to get wrong like in his earlier contributions to the series. There is the standard question of what is going on with the kids and their school that they never seem to attend anymore.My real disappointment this time comes from the author's insistence on using the term Indian and not Native American. If we are to truly love our neighbor, should we refer to them by a derogatory word? I think not.While this is Riordan's best effort in the series, it is also his last. Bob DeMoss will be taking over the series with the next book (The Wiccan)."
1,didn't get what i ordered,"I ordered this book from New Chapter Recycling, Inc and did not get the book that i saw on the computer. I ordered the entire series and having one book that doesn't match the other one looks off. When you order from them make sure you get what you are buying. I contacted them and so far nothing, they should send me another at their expense not mine. Very disappointed!!!"
1,Annoying shortcomings,"While the pieces are appealing, the playing surface is marred by the company logo and other irrelevant markers. A chaturanga playing surface was traditionally made of non-chequered cloth (although you can use any kind of 8 x 8 playing surface). I would therefore have preferred a playing surface without logos and other markers. What is worse, is that I received a copy of the game where the black colour had two kings and no horse. Returning the game to the US would have been an expensive exercise, and writing to the supplier and producer asking for a black horse did not help. No reply, no service. So, although the game is interesting in itself, this version and the service behind it are not recommended."
3,Second Act Trouble,"This is a wonderful idea for a book, but many of the ""failed"" shows that were discussed were not the most choice considering the wealth of shows that could have been discussed. Some were not even entirely ""bombs"" and if fact made or didn't lose that much money. I would have enjoyed it more if the book had dealt strictly with shows that were complete flops and more rationale as to why they failed. However the book does have many interesting tidbits and generally was a good read. However, I felt they didn't mine a lot of the treasure to be had."
2,How did Suskind get authorship credit on this book?,"If you are looking for a fresh look at some of Broadway's bomb, do not stop here.Suskind wrote very little in this book of previously-published material by other people. This book is more accuratly ""compiled by"" than ""by"" him.I refrain from entirely discounting this book because it publishes (more or less) in their entirety sources that were used by much better authors by their much better books. It may be a reference for theatre students, but there isn't much else to recommend this book.And don't get me wrong; flops are a source of morbid fascination for me. This is why I am so disappointed with this particlar volume -- there's nothing in it that you can't get in other, better written, better compiled, and better organized tomes."
2,Very disappointing,"Compared to the wit and flair I had expected, I found this volume boring and dull. It is largely a compilation (with Suskin providing brief notes) of theatrical reviews. Approach this with care if, as I did, you searched on a star's name and found a mention in this book - it may be only one line.I had expected great humour, inside knowledge, entertaining stories of the backstage. Frankly, I wish I had kept the receipt - I would have returned it the next day."
2,Trouble with 2nd Act trouble,"I was extremely disapointed with this book, having read most of the essays contained therein from other sources."
3,why can't i keep the title in my head!?,"i read this book and after i finished it, i felt i had enjoyed it. but when i went to purchase it, i couldn't remember the name of it.then, i was asked by more than a few people for a recommendation of a good book. and i would describe this one but not be able to catch the name for the life of me. and i wondered if it was me, or the title.well, part of it is the title. it explains what the book is about but doesn't capture the humor of its subject matter or the acerbic prose used by suskin.and then of course, is that snappy, light, humorous tone. it's fine for a start but then, i didn't stay invited in the book. i read it quickly because i wanted to see the other musicals for this perspective. but then i realized i can't tell you very much about the shows.and after a moment or two, i can't even tell you any insightful line that suskin wrote about the shows. just that tone--light-hearted, well-researched but not probing or enlightening."
2,Disappointing,"My wife just received this book and was very disappointed. It is only 44 pages of content with the first 17 pages dealing with history. There are only 18 substantial recipes in the whole book. This book is very thin and almost seems designed as a children's book, but with a ~[price]pricetag. Not worth the shipping to return it."
4,"A good simple, easy to use Vietnamese Cookbook","I liked this cookbook and can recommend it to someone looking for his or her first introduction to Vietnamese cooking. This book is one of a series ""easy menu ethnic cookbooks"" published by Lerner Publications Company. It introduces Vietnamese cooking and features some well-known Vietnamese recipes such as spring rolls, Vietnamese fried rice, and my favorite, Bun bo sao (Vietnamese noodle bowl with beef). In addition, the cookbook includes information on the land, history, and holidays of the country.I have a copy of Nicole Routhier's Foods of Vietnam, which also covers some of the same dishes; however, Ms. Routhier's cookbook is more suited to the cook that has quite a bit of time available to prepare her recipes. Cooking the Vietnamese Way is more suited to the everyday cook."
5,Like Washing in the Rain,This item is superior to any other shower head I've ever used due to its size. It's a joy to use.
4,A powerful tale of love and loss,"Reading this book was an emotionally draining experience-the kind that always comes after reading a thrilling literary novel. Many of the characters in this book feel loss in one sense or another, but it's the way Crombie conveys this that make the book so potent. With magnificent characters and startling plot twists, this elaborate whodunit keeps you guessing up until the end. Even though I was disappointed by the identity of the killer, the book was still worth it. Superintendent Duncan Kincaid gets an unexpected call from his ex-wife, who is writing a biography of ill-fated poet. Asked to look into the poet's suicide, Duncan finds some inconsistencies but the police refuse to reopen the case. Suddenly his ex-wife is murdered; poisoned just like the poet. Now Duncan and his partner and lover, Sergeant Gemma James, must find out who murdered the poet in order to expose his ex-wife's killer."
3,Another British murder mystery,"I though this book was entertaining and well written. It is another in the slew of mystery novels featuring Britiesh gentlemen detectives, combining crime solving with personal dilemmas. This is similar to books written by Ruth Rendell. What I liked best about the book was the descriptions of Cambridge, which brought back my own university days. What I liked least was the murder plot - this writer is so good that I don't think she needs to rely on formula. She would do just fine writing straight literary fiction.I read this several years ago and then reread it - I didn't realize that I had already read it till half-way through, so I guess it is not a particularly memorable book."
4,Not up there with Elizabeth George...,"I read this book after hearing comparisons to Elizabeth George and that it had won an Edgar Award. I was somewhat disappointed. I didn't think the plot was very engaging (I had no trouble putting the book down) and I never really developed an affinity for the main characters Kincaid and Gemma. I never felt the book read as a true Enlish mystery. It felt more like the author had plugged in some British slang, some facts from a Cambridge travel guide, and had the characters drinking tea every other page. There was no shortage of possible culprits and the ending was a surprise. Maybe going into it expecting it to be as good as an Elizabeth George ruined it for me."
2,A big disappointment,"I like cozies, and I've enjoyed the first 4 books in this series. They're well-plotted mysteries, with interesting characterizations.But this one is disappointing. I've read the first 75 pages, and so far, at least, there's a great deal of description -- of places and thoughts -- and virtually nothing related to a mystery.In other words, it's boring.Some other readers have stated in their reviews here that the first part of the book is slow, but I think they've understated the reality. It's extremely slow, uninteresting and almost dreary.Has the author come to take her readers for granted?I think I'll just skip to the end (something I do very rarely), and hope that the sixth volume in the series returns to the excellence of the first four."
4,Comfortable Mystery Read,Deborah Crombie gives a nice comfortable mystery story with several detours for one to ponder. Characters are very interesting people. This story was strange but well written. It kept my interest. Kincaid and Gemma's relationship is moving along nicely. On to the next.
4,"Good mystery, increased understanding of Duncan Kincaid.","We learn a lot more about Duncan Kincaid's past in this book, and he starts to become a fuller character. It also introduces us to eras of English history earlier in the 19th century."
3,A bit uncredible.,"After reading Leave the Grave Green as an audiobook and enjoying it thoroughly, I was tempted to read more Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James mysteries. I picked out Dreaming of the Bones. While Deborah Crombie is a skillful writer, and there were many things in the story I enjoyed, there were a number of plot elements that I found uncredible that detracted from this sequel. I did not find a credible motive for the main murder nor the accidental murder years earlier that started the chain of deceit. It just didn't work for me that the whole group of kids would have hidden a foolish crime or an accident the way they did. To have a successful mystery you have to have a believable premise that delivers at the end, and this one didn't."
3,Advertised as stainless,"The Adapt Hitch was advertised as being a stainless post. It is magnetic, so I doubt it is stainless. I already have the standard chrome plated ball and it is rusting after several Wisconsin winters. Otherwise, I like the ball. It is very handy to switch the ball without any tools."
2,Why Tchaikovsky was homosexual is of interest to me.,"Brown figured out where Tchaikovsky's musical ideas came from, and how he wrote music. Also, authors like Brown, Poznansky and others mention Tchaikovsky's homosexuality, but don't explain or stress why. My thoughts here are about Tchaikovsky and his sexuality. Some people may misunderstand it or simply not know what caused it. You may not find this interesting, but I do. If Tchaikovsky's sexuality is mentioned, authors should at least try to figure out and stress why. I've read different sources on Tchaikovsky and psychology. Why isn't this psychology stressed and emphasized by Tchaikovsky's authors? So, like Brown, I don't think Tchaikovsky's authors tried to emphasize why Tchaikovsky was homosexual, and I think they should have."
4,My dog loved this toy!,"I have a beagle mutt that has been with us for 2 years. She is estimated to be about 5 years old. A true pound puppy! She enjoys plush toys the most & really loves it if she can eventually chew them apart & dig out all the stuffing & the squeeker! So when I found this toy I hoped she would enjoy digging the balls out. A VERY durable toy, she has yet to chew the balls or the cube apart - doesn't even try to. I'm impressed & looking forward to buying other interacive toys for her. These are expensive I think as dog toys go but, when I discovered how much fun she has with it worth every penny!"
1,misleading,"The description said 7 piece set, but when you look at the product picture you think your getting 7 pieces not 7 little rings for the arm. I paid 2 times more for this shipping than the product cost. Then I got 7 pink arm rings where the picture shows several colors. You can't pick the colors because you are thinking they are coming in a multi pak. I had no problem with the item being sent here but this company stands by their name."
1,dont buy this,i order them few days ago .and i dont like them at all .they are easy to bend and it dont look how they show in picture :( waste of money
2,scoundrels,"scoundrels!, say 7 pieces and do not specify that. deceivers!, with the cover image. why not say that the 7 PIECES are rings. That is very wrong!. repent and change that picture. the time of exchange was gold mirrors for centuries"
1,BANGLES,THESE WERE JUST CHEAP. BROKE FIRST TIME TRYING TO PUT THEM ON. WERE NOT EVEN WORTH THE MONEY PAID FOR THEM. I WOULD HAVE GAVE THEM AWAY
5,Smile Maker,This was a gift for my grand daughter. She's a happy camper! I bought this item last year and must say they are more durable than I expected them to be. She still has & shares them with others during her playdates.
4,Interesting look into the life of a man you've never heard of,"The book describes of the life of a quite remarkable Norwegian scientist who discovered the cause of the Aurora Borealis, invented the electro-magnetic canon, and created the process for synthesizing fertilizer.The book is an entertaining account, that falls short in its discussion of his science. As a personal account, his scientific journeys to Finmark in the heart of winter are an incredible demonstration of dedication to science."
4,coconut cups,"Best price, quick shipping. Just in time for a last minute addition to a birthday party."
5,"she's done a great book for the typical,netchick kind of gal","carla has done a fantastic job on her book for the young, hip, savvy netchick. i loved it! YOU GO GIRL!!!! LOVE, TABBI"
3,They Taste Awful But They Help Make My Throat Feel Better!,I get allergies that make my throat dry itchy and sore and even over the counter and prescription medicines don't seem to help relieve my itchy throat but I find that Halls Mentho-Lyptus Drops with vaper action helps to give my throat temporary relief as it helps to numb it. The taste is very mediciney and quite nasty and I find that to be with all of it's flavors including the so called cherry flavor which in my opinon is the most yucky tasting of the flavors but as long as I can get some relief from an itchy throat I'm pleased but I wish they could come out with a flavor that tastes good and doesn't make me gag on it's yucky mediciney taste! I have tried the throat losenges that have pectin instead of menthol and euculyptus and they do taste better but they just don't do anything to make my throat feel good when it is very itchy or sore so even with a yucky taste I will have to choose these instead!
5,Joyous and contemplative seamless music,"Jim Oliver is unique among ""New Age"" musicians. His pieces unfold over a half hour or more, an unbroken flow of layered shifting tones that create a joyous, peaceful feeling of flow. Musicians will find his themes and chordal changes fascinating as is the way he uses a wide and creative range of synthesized tones. This is no tired rehash of world music sounds as is so much other new age schlock.Since buying it first in the early 1990s on tape I've worn out this recording and came here to buy the CD."
2,makin' oopsy,"Recorded in 1961 (the days when an in-joke about swinging could still be a sly snap of Sinatra with a mid-swing green putter) this Billy May-conducted orchestra `swing' album is one of ol' Blue Eyes' weakest. In his attempt to cross-over between crotch-stream and mainstream, Sinatra fails on both counts. Not a single tune here is memorable (try singing a single verse from Please Don't Talk About Me). Sinatra knew it. So too did Reprise. The May orchestra tries like hell to carry itself next to the legend, but it fails in it's enthusiasm and in it's lack of subtlety. Ouch! So too does Sinatra. Never in his swinging years (mark the time frame between 1957 and 1965) did he sound so unenthused and robotic in his vocals. Swing Along With Me? He was lucky no one was swinging at him."
4,Sinatra is swingin' again!,"Not as good as previous swingin' albums, but quite alright. Songs are arranged by Billy May."
2,Not the best Econ Book,"I got this book for my econ class and disliked it from the beginning. The authors attempt at humor and light heartedness just makes the material more confusing. Also the books lack of any color makes it much less attractive and useful than other books that show their graphs and diagrams in color. The color helps distinguish better between lines and other material. I would not recommend this book, and if you have a choice don't get it."
4,Light & Sweet,"This is not a heavy book. It is light, fun reading. I think the heroine Anne is adorable and her hero Aiden is a hunk.I personally like books where the characters come together quickly and then work on their relationship together. That's what this book is about. They are married on the first 10 pages and work on their marriage from there.There is not a bunch of mean spirited fighting and misunderstandings which is something I hate. I really dislike books where the H/H spend the whole book fighting and then fall in love on the last 5 pages.I read romances for a light, quick, fun read and that's exactly what this book is.Suzanne"
2,Cartoonish,"While not a necessarily bad book, I found this book to not be worth the time it took to read it. Cathy Maxwell writes a lot like Julie Garwood - often anachronistic, rather silly at times; Some of the conversations had me rolling my eyes in exasperation. Again, it's an ok book, I just like a historical romance that's more intelligently written."
4,Quite wonderful.,"I thought this was quite a lovely story. A young girl Anne, who with little options left, agreed to a proxy marriage to a `mad' Earl in Scotland - Aiden. She meets her husband for this first time dressed in only a kilt and blue paint - quite terrifying her. This begins a merriment and emotional battle of Anne wanting a home and consequently the marriage, while Aiden wants to chose his own bride, and bristles at his sister's interference in the arranged marriage. Within the battle of their marriage, there is also the uprising of Scotland and treason accusations.I purchased the audio version of the novel, and thought the narration was well done. I really enjoyed the story and thought it was clever and sweet. I liked the heroine and hero; they both strive for the same thing, security of home, family and love. I liked that there were no gross misunderstandings, no mystery to solve (although there is political intrigue) but a beautifully developed relationship between Anne and Aiden."
4,Decent,"The narrator has a good voice and does the characters justice. The story itself is pretty decent too. Aiden Black, Earl of Tybalt is thought ""mad"" by London society and has been living in Scotland. His sister, forever convinced she'll die before he weds and has an heir, finds him a wife by proxy and marries him off. Anne Burnett is a poor orphan on the fringe of society and apparently the only person desperate enough in the ton to engage in this type of marriage. Set against the memories of the Rebellion of 1745 and the massacre at Caloudin, you get more Scottish rebellion and angst. What you don't get is when and how and why Ann and Aiden fall in love. But if you can get past that...it's entertaining enough."
2,"A ""Hallmark"" Historical Novel","You could feel the author was uncomfortable with the tame sexual scenes and stretching to include sexual language. The book was overall too ""Hallmark"" for my tastes and Anne, far too whinie about ""do you love me"", do you really love me""?Not a bad book though, just not what I like to read. For a really juicy story, read Jackie Ivy's ""Lady of the Knight"", Sophia Johnson ""Risk Everything"", and Susan Carroll's ""Dark Queen Trilogy, not particulary in that order, S. Carroll's books first."
4,The Source revealed...,"A fascinating and most readable biog about a truly great Soul-Sufi.It's evident from the beginning that there's much heart & insight in the writing, as it endeavours to unravel the mystery and majesty of Avatar Meher Baba's life-work. The only fault(nit-picking) is that some of the photograph reproductions are of variable quality. Highly recommended."
5,Blessings,Mary Lou is not only a fine and beautiful quilter she is an inspiration ! Her book grants us all permission to fly and soar on newly sprung quilt wings !
2,A Little Disappointed,I am a bit disappointed in this book. Oh if you are a person who likes to look at the pictures then this is the book for you but I like to look at the pictures and have how to instructions on how to make each quilt. This book does have some instruction but very lacking. The few templates are pretty congested on some pages. In my opinion this is an author who is showing other peoples quilts and not how too make each one. They are gorgeous quilts don't get me wrong I just wanted detailed instructions how to make the quilt as shown. It has suggestions but no real directions. This book is definitely not for the beginner quilt maker. Had I looked at the book in a store I would have never bought it. For me its a waste of money.
3,A really cool CD.,"Another great volume to a great collection. My fave songs are I Won't Say(I'm In Love), There's Only One Ariel, and Out of Thin Air. This great volume includes songs from Hercules, Mulan, Robin Hood and the Aladdin sequels.A great CD for Dsiney and Disney Princess lovers. Really cool!"
5,wonderful,my daughter loves this cd it is all she ever listens to. It has all the songs from the movies she loves.
1,Make the bad man go away...,"Listening to this CD is proof that there IS hell on earth.There goes time I will never get back again...Barry Manilow beware, there's a new sherrif in town."
3,Awesome series,"We are late comers to this series, and have been caught up in the latest escapades. So it was with great expectations we ordered the first three series, unfortunately disc one didn't play properly, so had to return it, hence only three stars. Seller was excellent and gave a full refund. The experience wouldn't put me off using them again or recommending them."
1,CD Side won't play,"If you are expecting to get a CD with the DVD as a bonus DO NOT BUY THIS!!! The CD side has some type of copy protection that keeps computers, Media Centers, and some newer cd/dvd players from recognizing disk. Forget about fair use or using this on a portable player. I've bought hundreds of CDs and this is the only one I can't play. I'd give this a zero star or lower if Amazon allowed it."
5,Seeds SAVE THE SEEDS,Save your heirloom and precious seeds from your Organic gardenI have saved even our drought seeds and I am going to use them this next spring coming up and hopefully we don't have a drought but if we do we will be ready and I an sure these seeds will prosper.I also not only save them to plant but to eat as well as a tiny little plant and eat sprouts that are the highest in nutrients in these the little sprout.So with all my raw books and this book they make good companions.Now i just need to know when to plant out here I think would be Feb 2013thx again medicine
5,Great guide to saving seeds,This guide to seed starters will offer the insight needed to save your own seeds for the your future gardens.
5,Indispensable for serious start from seed gardeners,"Nancy has researched and presented in simple and easy to use format the critical information needed for successful early season indoor gardening. If you want to save a ton of money and have great bedding plants you grow yourself, this book will give you invaluable assistance. I like her ""down to earth"" approach and clear explanations of her methods. If you're a serious gardener, you will seriously love this book!"
2,Better titled the 1930's Seed Starters book,"Not a good book. The advice in this book seems to be written for the gardeners of a 100 years ago. And it's way too verbose. If properly edited the book would be about 1/4 of its current size, it would be direct and to the point instead of constantly rambling, and would incorporate useful information about contemporary products and techniques. As it is I find this book next to useless. My general gardening books provide better, more current information on seed starting than this book does. Plus it's printed on poor quality paper."
4,Excellent How-To,"A copy of this book was lent to me and I was happy to find it was still available on Amazon. I've read it nearly cover to cover. Got me past some of my past failures with starting plants. Good basic info, starting seeds, growing, and then collecting for next year's gardens."
5,Good book for beginners,I found this book to be very informative and have already used some of the techniques I have read about in this book to start some tomato seedlings. I found out how to mix my own seed starting mix and while I didn't have the exact ingredients I modified the mix to fit what I did have. The book gave an overview of some of the common ingredients in a mix and what their purpose was. It also gives advice on seed saving and how to prevent crossing of different species.I highly recommend this book as it gives very practical advice and suggests using things that are readily available around the house.DWH
2,unreadable titles,"I attempted to add this CD to my windows media player, and when I loaded it to my computer, all the song titles appeared in some foreign language. I'm not sure if the titles are in Arabic or some Asian alphabet, but they are certainly not english or any European language. All the music is in English, but it is very confusing."
4,Rock & Roll,This band is a staple for anyone who loves classic rock. So many great songs that will live on forever.
5,Classic,I really like this music despite the age. You just have to love the old time rock and roll. Just makes you feel better no matter what is going on.
2,"Crusin is not the ""Duets"" version, it's shorter!","Just want to make folks aware that if you are expecting the full ""Duets"" version of Crusin', don't buy the one on this album. It's a shorter edited version that seems to just fade away in the middle of the song."
2,Find the original CD releases B4 Buying this.,"In short, the idea of remastering is nice but a bad idea. Whoever did the remaster must have used Bobby Brady headphones for the reference playback. Boom crash. Highs are punishing and bass is boomy. I found the original release of Sports ( I friend had one) and played back The Heart of Rock and Roll on two players and switched between them the difference is amazing....... FIND THE ORIGINAL discs that the tracks you like are on and save your money......"
5,It's really is a greatest hits album,Being an owner ofSports (And The News)which is also a good album. But it was missing a few songs so this one does a great job filling the gaps. The liner notes have some neat pictures. I like the one with Huey sitting on the beach with the News in the sand up to their heads. Containing 21 tracks it's a well packed disc. Having a live version of Trouble in paradise is one of many songs making it worth the buy. There's nothing wrong with being (Hip to be square) when (Workin' for a livin') only to get a (Couple days off) on the weekends to do some (Crusin').
5,Some of the most feel-good music of the 80s,"A group responsible for some of the most broadly appealing music of the 80s, Huey Lewis & The News could rock out (Heart & Soul, The Heart Of Rock & Roll), demonstrate marvelous pop sensibility (The Power Of Love, If This Is It), and even get kinda soulful (Doing It All For My Baby, Stuck With You). All of those great hits are included here, plus several others (Hip To Be Square, I Want A New Drug, and their brilliant cover of ""It's Alright"" by J.J. Jackson)."
4,Back to the ... Past,Great exeprience of comming back to the times when HLatN were on the top. Nice review of the best. Still more songs from Four Chords & Several Years Ago would be great but anyway worth to buy.
3,"Where's ""Walking on a Thin Line""?","There's no excuse to omit the Top 20 hit ""Walking on a Thin Line,"" especially with solo Lewis tunes such as ""Cruisin'."""
3,K TEL HUEY LEWIS AND THE NEWS GREATEST HITS,"This remind me of a K-Tel Compact disc. Where they cut most of the songs.It is sad to see this on the disc. The remixes of the following.The Heart Of Rock n' Roll, I Want A New Drug, Power Of Loce, Jacob Ladder are terrible remixes by probably a amateur producer with no ear for music. I would recomend that you buy Time Files instead if you can get a used copy. The reason that I keep it I'm along time fan of Huey and the News and from the North Bay like Mr. Lewis"
1,damaged,"Unfortunately this CD was damaged which I didnt notice until I put it in my car CD player. Now I cannot get the CD back out, and will probably have to pay a $100 or so for a shop to get the CD out so I can use my car CD player again."
3,All songs edited,Here is the good about the album: The songs are great. The songs selected are very good it has something from every album but the Plan B album. The remastering is good too. I have all the albums and loved them as a kid growing as I do now in my 30's. It's great to have them all together. Also I will say kudos for including Back in Time from B2F soundtrack. The Crusin' song is on there too (edited).Here is the bad:The fact that they crammed all 21 of them onto 1 cd stinks. All the solos and great instrumental parts of the songs have been taken out. They should have done 2 discs in order to include the complete songs. I still have the time flies GH from '96. It ony has 12 songs as I recall but they are unedited and the complete versions of the songs. So I'll hang onto that. I realize they cd is 80 mins with 21 songs this is great but with the solos gone it's not a great as it could have been.
4,Can You Feel It?,"21 tracks from one of the greatest rock bands of the 1980s, it's Huey Lewis & the News, featuring classic tracks like ""the Power of Love"" off of Back to the Future, ""I Want a New Drug"" off of Sports & ""the Heart of Rock & Roll"" also off Sports, ""Do you Believe in Love"" off of Fore & many more from the 80s, 90s & 00s, in the 80s when Hair bands were the popular rock of the 80s, Huey Lewis & the News were the other great rock band to come out of that decade. These guys rock, great songs, buy this CD"
5,Huey Lewis where have you been!!!,"This CD rocks! I have been a big fan of Huey Lewis and I never realised it until this CD. Sure I have known known of some Huey Lewis songs... but when I popped in this CD I reconized practially ever songs and didn't reallize they were all Huey Lewis... I am thinking of starting a HL coverband called ""Screwey Dewey and the Infomercials""... Have to stop typing and listen to the CD!"
5,"Upbeat, fun music","You can't listen to this every day. But every couple of months, it's a nice lift. All their big hits are on this CD. I attended one of their concerts in the D.C. area and every time that I play this, it brings back some good memories."
5,A fine album,This is an excellent album. Every song is a favorite. I can't reccomend this album enough.
4,"WARNING: one hit is missing, but otherwise great collection!","I considered buying this CD for convenience, since I own all the CD's with most of these songs, EXCEPT that one big hit is missing: ""Walking on a Thin Line."" It is on the ""Sports"" CD. My guess is that whomever owns the rights to it won't let go. I could look up why, but I'm not THAT bored. I haven't seen it included on ANY HL&N greatest hits collections. So just wanted to warn would-be buyers that it's missing from this collection. Maybe try to find it as a single, or buy SPORTS as well."
4,Huey Lewis & The News - Greatest Hits,"There are a couple of tracks on this CD that I don't care for, but that is a personal opinion. I must say the track I love the most is the duet with Huey Lewis and Gwynneth Paltrow, ""Cruisin."" Wonderful! That made the whole CD worth purchasing, though I am enjoying all the familiar hits the group made. ""I Want A New Drug"" is still just plain fun!"
4,Recommended,"I am not one to laugh out loud when reading, a fact mentioned by both my housemates when they separately caught me chuckling while reading The Year of the Roasted Ear. The book is above all funny, but is also perceptive (usually at the same time), especially about westerners travelling abroad. It provides several refreshing variations on the adventure travel themes."
1,Doesn't fit!,"This product SHOULD work, but only if your door doesn't fall between 33 1/2"" and 35"". My doorway is 34"" wide and it's a 1/2"" too short without the extendtion and 1"" too wide with the extention. I called the manufacturer and it's NOT listed on the box but she confirmed that this is true!"
5,"Excellent book! An eye opener, a must read!","I saw the interview the author did on Tony Brown's Journal, and was curious and impressed, with the subject. Evanz, did meticulous and pain staking research to come up with this one. I am so glad he did it so our people, especially the different church factions, can start to realize that Malik El Hajj Shabazz was correct when he said ""they don't hang you because you muslim, or baptist, they hang you because you're black!"" Nuff said!"
2,Evanzz's bias unfortunately leads to many conjectures.,"Although Evanzz provides a large amount of data in this book, he wastes too much time on the conjecture and biasis of his own ideas in areas where his research lacked. Because of the complexity of views on the subject, this book should serve as a suplement for others in its category.For the true historian, a good balance to Evanzz's manuscript would be Nation of Islam leader, Louis Farrakhan's narrative of events which led to the tragic murder of Malcolm X.. ""The Murder of Malcolm X""."
4,Beyond modernization and underdevelopment,"McMichael avoids the classic pitfall of falsely dichotomizing his development themes into modernization and/or underdevelopment theory. Nor does he leave us in the postmodern paralysis of absolute relativity. His straightforward and readable style reveals the entire postwar development project and its consequences, as well as the rise of the globalization project now under way. McMichael underscores his points with case studies and acutely observes the cultural phenomena and localized resistance of our times. Development and Social Change brings the sociology of development to the edge of modernity and the end of our century, in a vocabulary and style open to laypersons and sociologists alike."
5,Great quality,The book was brand new so there was nothing wrong with it. It came on time as well. I recommend getting this book from this cite.
3,Development and Social Change,This product wasn't clearly labeled according to edition on the Amazon page so it was a later edition than I had hoped for (9th edition) but I took that risk. I also was hoping that with expidited shipping I would recieve it sooner but it took about the full 6 days (business days and there was a holiday inbetween so i got it in about 9). But the book was in great condition so overall glad I bought it.
5,Fabulous!,"Usually professors who assign their own book for a class tend to be egotists. McMichael bucked that trend, however, by assigning his book which explained everything I ever needed or wanted to know about how the world works. The structure of the book makes it easy for anyone to understand and explains the state of the world today using historical context, which I found fascinating. However cheesy this may be, I honestly think the world would be a better place if more people read this book."
5,The best historical fiction I ever read!,"I love this book! I finished it in one day, I just couldn't put it down! I never read any of Ann Rinaldi's books before, but now I just can't stop! I recommend this book to anyone who likes cliff hanging suspense, a little history, and romance. This book had a great ending, even though some sad events happen. I absolutely love this book, all my friends do too!"
5,One of Rinaldi's Best,"This is by far one of my favorite Ann Rinaldi books (one of my favorite books in fact). She managed to pull off a good satisfying romance without having it be TOO mushy or unoriginal. I have read a lot of Revolutionary War fiction, and I have to say that this one beats almost all of it. It is original and unique, yet it is historically correct. I absolutely LOVE Jemima mostly because she has faults and isn't perfect. All in all this is a wonderful book, and definitely one of my all time favorites."
3,"Revolutionary war, battle of Trenton",Revolutionary war from the viewpoint of a girl who lives in Trenton and whose tutor supports the British.... or does he? Kind of a dumb love story but does a fairly good job of interesting girls in some of the political aspects of the war.
5,A wonderful book,I enjoyed this book tremendously. I've been reading Ann rinaldis books for about two or three years and this was one of my favorites. The plot ran smoothly and was rwell carried out and you loved the main characters. I reccommend this book for anyone who love a good story that you can perfectly picture in your imagination.
5,A touch of Magic to last for Generations,"I have read countless books by Ann Rinaldi, everything every local library and book store has to offer, and for some reason that I don't understand, this book stuck out the most, it was different than her others, in a way I can't really place. Her tutor for instance John Reid, had a completely different personality than any of her heroine's other beau's, his unique, strong, and wise character really drew me into the book. Jem was really different than Ms. Rinali's other characters, she was not so confused and tangled up by the war, she knew exactly what she was about from the beginning to the end, and I found that was a good quality for this character to have. I think Ms. Rinaldi added a touch of magic as she wrote this book, it is amazing beyond words, and I know it is one of her novels that I will read many times over the years, cherish and pass onto my own children, in this book she has created a classic that will last centuries, if we are lucky."
5,Wonderful book!,I read Time Enough For Drums for the first time about a month ago and I absolutely fell in love with it. I keep it near my bedside and have read it twice already. It's great and I would reccomend it to anyone. Ann Rinaldi is magnificent.
5,One of her greatests,"I would have to say this is one of Rinaldi's greatests yet! History,adventure,and a bit of romance all in one!This one was the first I read of hers,and this book made me want to read more of her work. Hey, if your a girl who doesnt do manners,well this book is for you!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent book to read! Highly reccomendend.,"I read it for the first time when I was twelve years old. I read it over and over until the age of sixteen. I lent it to a friend to read and they lost it. I have been searching for another copy of the book, but am unable to find it. This search has lasted for four years. Now, I am not one to fall in love with a book so easily. That is why I must stress the quality of this book. It is historically correct, as well as very heart-felt. I still remember this book like I read it yesterday; however, I still have the urge to pick it up and read it all over again. I commend the author of this small-recognized masterpeice."
3,Kind of Depressing,"I kept reading this book; it's a book you have to keep reading until the end. It was kind of depressing though, because a lot of people died. It seemed like a soap opera because first Jem liked Raymond, then dated her teacher who was nine years older than her!!! I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't like books where people die. They would be disappointed."
5,A Wonderful Book by a Wonderful Author,"If you think you've seen it all, think again. Ann Rinaldi brings to life a wonderful story that twists and turns with every chapter and every page. A deep love story, and a classic piece of historical work, Ann Rinaldi has proven in this book that writing for her is a natural talent. She takes information from the Revelutionary War, adds a bit of ""Rinaldi Flavor"" and produces a book! For anyone who has not read this yet, grab your copy and sit down today! You won't want to miss this treasured gift!"
3,Time enough for drums,This book was a bit of a disapointment.I am a fan of Ann Rinaldi but this this book seemed to lack detail.I feel this book was kinda longwinded and boring. I'd say just skip it.
5,You wont ever find a better author,This book is the best you will read. Its exciting and interesting. Ann Rinaldi is my favorite author i have read all but two of her books and i found that even her first book was really good i recomend her books for 6th graders and up i garante you it will be ur faivorite book
4,WONDERFUL,This series of books are the best there is for covering everything about florida. Easy to read and find things and beautiful photos.
2,"Please Don't ""Tell Me Why""!","This book was such a disappointment! I picked it up, expecting an engrossing romance with a twist -- instead I got a heroine who was practically two different characters -- the whipped, defeated ""doormat"", unsure of everything and everyone (especially herself), and the lusty, hedonist who seduces the incredibly tolerant hero in an outlandish scene in his office.Yikes! I really wanted to like this woman but she bore little resemblance to any rational, normal human being.This is not one of Cameron's best -- the story lurches from one character's perspective to another -- and there are several improbable plot twists along the way.I finished the book (my perverse curiosity) and can only add, ""Huh??????????"""
1,Tell Me Why I Bought It,"I'm halfway through the book and I give up. Shifting points of view, unbelievable characters and sentences I have to read two and three times to understand did me in. The book darts around so much it makes my head spin. Disconnected sentences strung together make this read like a first draft. I wonder if anyone read it before sending it to the printer. It takes a lot to make me bash a book, but this is among the worst I've ever read. Make that tried to read. It doesn't even deserve one star."
1,I Have No Idea Why,"I don't know where to start listing the things that irked me in this book. The characters were all mainly unbelievable. I wanted to yell at them all right but it wasn't to warn them but to tell Carolee to stop being so stupid. He ex-husband really did a number on her and she started investigating things when it was almost too late. And the secrets ""dear old Sam"" revealed added to the strange list of unbelievable scenarios. The scenes played out in Faith's ICU room topped the list of can't believe this. Stella is NOT on my list of must read authors."
1,Oh Please!,A completely forgetable book. I was so disappointed! Pass on this one. I'm going back to Nora a writer I can count on to deliver 'Time and Again!'
1,A trashy piece of garbage!,I can not believe a book like this was allowed to be printed with such smut in it. VERY DISAPPOINTED and I want a refund!
4,Great resource,This has been a very useful resource. It contains background material and multiple activity ideas for each lesson. Definitely a help for people like me who aren't particularly creative.
4,Ses débuts...,"Comme de la musique est son premier album, mais on ne peut pas dire qu'il soit amateur. On y sent déjà toute l'émotion qui explosera lors de ses prochains albums, mais surtout lors de ses shows sur scène!Grande voyageuse, elle ira srement bientt près de chez vous pour y planter son arbre à fruit.Pour les dernières nouvelles concernant Marie-Jo : Consultez www.lamaline.tk"
1,Not professional grade hardware - not even residential grade,"This stuff is just plain junk. Many companies offer professional grade video surveilance gear at reasonable prices here on amazon. They have NEMA 5+ enclosures, use cabled installs, and run forever without maintenance.Then there is this junk that logitech is reselling from wilife. It should be renamed whatajoke. Mostly indoor with a few outdoor rated deviced that quickly suffer a miserable death, my experience with the system was so positively negative that I went with the pro gear which in the end cost less than repurchasing this scrapmetal as it died off.Save yourself the fustration and avoide wilife / logitech from the start - look at established names like pelco / sony / etc. for security."
4,So far it's working great for me,"The outdoor starter kit is the one I bought. I also had problems getting it to work. If I had known it was my firewall, it would have been a 15 minute install, not hours. As soon as I shut my firewall down, the connection was made, and I started receiving video. I've since read of others who also had firewall issues, so I know it wasn't just me. All the other features, remote computer viewing, and e-mail alerts, work just fine for me. I've only had the system(2 cameras), for 3 weeks, so I can only hope I don't have the power supply problems, or camera failure, that others reportedly have.My suggestion to those of you that can't get it to work, is shut down your firewall or just use the Windows firewall, as I am doing now. It could save you some time and grief. If the cameras don't fail, I think it is a real good, economical, and easy to use system. No users manual included, only a fold out, map like instructions."
2,Intentially Crippled Software- $80 per YEAR? I don't think so,"Easy to install and configure. However, my wife really wanted something that would notify her when someone pulled in the driveway. E-mail? No problem, but nobody checks their email continuously. How about a simple popup on the home office computer it's installed on?NO. That's an upgrade- not just $80, but $80 PER YEAR. I don't need any of the other Platinum features, just this basic feature that should be in the basic application. Charge me for e-mail, but don't charge me to play a stupid .WAV file on the host PC. Logitech is cutting their own throat and hamstringing a perfectly good product. Stupid companies with product management run by idiotic MBAs that never talk to their customers."
3,Logitech Wilife outdoor camera fix,"The Logitech Wilife outdoor cameras have a known defect (caps melting). They fail in about a year. This is due to the following four 1000uF caps: C26 C27 C31 C32. The initial was a10v cap then later releases were 16v. I replaced them with 25v. See Digikey part number UHE1E102MHD6. The caps are from Nichicon and are Aluminum Electrolytic. They are rated for 10,000 hours at 105 degrees C. The caps don't fit perfectly (the original are 8mm diameter versus 12.5mm that I put in) so insulate the leads and let them float above the circuit board."
1,Camera only lasts a year!,"Camera only lasted a year...now the system is worthless unless I buy another camera. If I had known it was only going to last this long, I would have bought something else."
3,IT's ALRIGHT.,"I kinda expected a little less modernism from Charlie and wanted him to bring back the old school. However, with the production by Tricky Stewart, Marc Nelson, and Case I kinda get what I'm looking for with a twist. ""Without You"" and ""Can I take You home"" are definitely jams on this album."
3,Uncle Charlies' voice is the Saving Grace...,"5 stars for Charlies' voice; 2 for the music. Picture this: the middle-aged guy hanging out in the club with the younger crowd. I realize that Charlie has a lot of fans in the hip hop community, but what's up with this O.G., playa playa, big pimpin' thing? C'mon now, Charlie could do an album of nursery rhymes and people would still buy it! Themes like 'I got what u need', 'Would you mind', 'Big Pimpin'; these songs are not what I'd expect from an R&B icon. The ballads, however, are better; 'Without you' is obviously aimed at the crossover, but its still sweet; on 'Another Man' its amusing to listen to Case trying to hang vocally; 'Can I take you Home' is a FUNKY slowjam, while 'A Wonderful One' has a kind of laid back feel with a modern flip; I liked that. Overall, buy this one because its CHARLIE singing. But let's hope that on the next record, the songs will be on par with Charlies' singing."
5,This book fits in the series perfectly!!!,This book is the one of the best books ever written! The Xanth series is the best! A must read!
4,"Good, good book!","Piers Anthony's wonderful sense of humor and creativity are just two of the things that makes all of his books great to read. The characters are lovable and there are no ""slow"" spots anywhere in this book."
5,NEXT TO HARRY POTTER!!,i love piers anthony! i am so glad he wrote so many books! the only thing i don't like is that all the women in his books are beautiful. and all his men hansome. but other then that I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIS BOOKS! i cried in this one!
1,"Not a Piers Anthony Fan, It Turns Out","I tried to read this book. I got about 120 pages into it and decided I couldn't finish. There are those who think it's funny and clever, but I thought it was silly.This is the 2nd time I've tried to read Piers Anthony. I guess he just isn't for me."
5,"Good light fantasy here. Good characters, excellent plot.","I found this book thoroughly entertaining, and I think this is one of Anthony's better works. He is a more gifted writer than most people give him credit for being. If you like this one, try Dragon's Gold."
2,A bit better than the rest,"This was my favorite of the Xanth books, mostly because of the relationship between Dor and Jumper (the spider which was accidentally sucked into the tapestry with Dor). I mostly remember the quest Dor goes on to find a potion of restoration for a zombie, while fighting for his feelings for Millie (his nanny in the present and the woman he's protecting in the past), whose ""talent"" is magical sex appeal.Not worth delving into the sorrid land of Xanth for this one novel, either. Plus, given the rest of the series, I suspect there are a number of sexual references that I've forgotten, something that should not be in stories marketted for young teenage boys."
3,"A Bit Drier Than Most, But An Acceptable Xanth Adventure","Castle Roogna is the first of the Xanth novels to feature the quest of a teenage magician.The magnanimous muscleman who is the main character of the first two books, Bink has a son named Dor who is sent on a quest into Xanth's past. His goal is find a special elixir to turn Millie the former ghost's lover, Jonathan human again, who has been a rotting zombie for 800 years.The novel is a bit dry and not as lively as most of the series, certainly acceptable and appropriate. My favorite part was Dor's close friendship with a giant spider, who he is able to communicate with by using a strand of spiderweb. (Dor's magic allows him to communicate with inanimate objects).No spoiler here: Read the book. It's worth your time."
1,Jane Austen Critic,"This is not the good version of the classics by Jane Austin, you want the masterpiece not the BBC version."
1,waste of money,"I thought a Janie Austen Collection would have to be good, even if it wasn't the more popular films that I had seen on PBS. I was mistaken. Film is of poor quality, not impressed with the acting. I am very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this collection."
4,Jane Austin Collection,This an interesting set of DVD's. It is done by the BBC and follows the stories excellently. The sets are a little sparse but I have enjoyed them anyway.
1,Jane Austen Series,This film series is horrible to say the least. Do not purchase this series from the bbc producers or spend your money on it. What a misleading set of dvds this turned out to be!
1,Sense and sensibility,The DVD that I had received did not play once it hit scene 4. The picture stayed and dialog continue even with the same picture. I tried to forward the dvd put it just didn't play. How can I get another dvd that will work?
2,austen collection,"first off it was my fault for not looking closer at what exactly I was buying. I thought I was buying a collection of austen produced by A&E and what I got was a BBC production. The collection seemed ok at first but trying to move through the disk was a bit trying, I couln't get through the whole movie and wasn't sure if the movie was complete. Would I buy another BBC production, probably not....CB Hamilton Tacoma, Wa"
3,Worth it for the price,"These are not as good as the A&E versions, but for the price they're worth it."
2,Jane Austin Collection,"The movies were fine, but the DVD for Persuasion didn't work! I had to return the DVD twice and in the end I was refunded for my purchase. I would have thought the quality of the DVD series would have been better."
2,Not what I was expecting,"So...I was all excited watching the PBS Masterpiece Theatre - Jane Austen Series. I went to the PBS website and checked out how to purchase the movies I was viewing on TV. Saw this lovely set- price range about 60. Went to Amazon and got it for 42! Psyched at first, but after I opened it, I realized that these are pretty low budget BBC productions of Jane Austen's novels. Nice to have, but not the quality movies that Masterpiece has been showing. Will probably sell these on ebay now."
4,Jane Austen Collection,I have had hours of enjoyment from this package.It is a Great Collection at a Great Price.
5,Jane Austen fans will love it!,"We are really enjoying this series. They are not movies like one sees in theaters but TV mini-series, which gives more time for story development and detail. These BBC productions are very true to the original novels and, being shot on location in England with English actors, they offer a fascinating glimpse of life in that time and place. Very entertaining!"
2,Jane Austen (DVD) Collection,"There have been so many recent beautifully executed remakes of the Jane Austen novels that this collection was a disappointment. (Be aware this series is made up of older, classic versions.) Though from a script and character point of view there are some new insights, you have to get past the low budget production quality and that's not easy. The script for Pride & Prejudice and Emma were some of the best I've seen to reveal character motivation and insights, where some of the more recent versions have either missed or put too much of a contemporary spin on the characters."
1,Horrible,"I barely got through Pride & Prejudice & have no desire to see any of the others. The setting is like a stage play & the acting is very poor. The actor playing Mr. Darcy is stiff, never changes his facial expression, off the mark on the character, & not at all appealing. It definetely isn't worth the money & I'm sorry I wasted mine."
5,True to Austen's Intent,"This set of DVD's is quite well done. The characters, dialogue and settings are quite believable. The Austen legacy is preseved."
4,Jane Austen Collection,"The movies follow Austen's storyline and are enjoyable period pieces. They help to bring the era with its social mores and attitudes to life. This group of films filled a void left by the lack of more elaborate productions such as the more recent production of ""Pride and Prejudice""."
3,Problems in shipping,I ordered this set on 1-02-06 for my daughter's birthday on the1-08-06; I was told that it would arrive by 1-06. It was not delivered by the 12th. I finally reached someone who said the set was lost. It was sent again but very late. It seems that someone should be informed of each delivery and red flagged whendelivery is not as expected. Hazel Kelly
1,What a surprise,"I certainly didn't get what I was expecting with this purchase. I haven't even opened the box yet, and I'm greatly disappointed. It's probably my fault for not working through the fine print in the product notes, but this is not the BBC collection that I was expecting with Colin Firth and the gang from 1996. I suggest anyone thinking about buying this set be sure that they know what they are getting before pushng the ""add to cart"" button."
1,Waste of money,"I am very disappointed with this collection. While I can't complain about the acting, the filming is so poorly done. The characters are not at all pleasing to look at. The way their hair was done just bugged me to no end. I guess I'm sounding really shallow, but this set was not at all what I expected. I way prefer the newer versions."
3,Bought for someone else,I made this purchase as a gift for a friend. They said it was exactly what they were looking for.
2,Adoro a Jane Austen,"Si bien, son buenas adaptaciones de los libros de Jane Austen, no me gusto la edición, ni las interpretaciones de los actores.Hay otras versiones mucho mejores que esta.No vivo en USA, sino la hubiese devuelto."
3,Read the Books Instead,"I enjoy good movies based on classic novels. But when making a movie, make a MOVIE. The problem with these adaptations of Jane Austen's novels, is that they attempt to film the books. If that's what you like - and apparently judging by the reviews of some others - these films could be just what you are looking for. But I would just as soon read the books.If I want to watch a movie, I much prefer the Emma Thompson Sense and Sensibility, or the Gwyneth Paltrow Emma, to the films included in this package. The new Pride and Prejudice with Kierra Knightly is hardly Jane Austen; it was more like Emily Bronte. In fact, it was the best Wuthering Heights I ever saw. Nevertheless, it is still a very enjoyable movie.I suggest seeing the more recent films, though I though the new Persuasion was dull, and the new Mansfield Park ridiculous. Actually, the ones in this package are better than those."
1,jane austen collection,"I am confused, the description states the set has captions but several reviews claim it doesn't. Does it or doesn't it have captions? I don't understand why anyone would issue a DVD without captions. I am 70 and have problems understanding the dialogue in many of today's movies. My wife and I saw The DeVinci Code in a theater and I couldn't understand what the female lead was saying most of the time because of her mumbling. It wasn't until I got the DVD that I could understand what she was saying. I enjoy English TV shows like Midsomer Murders and have bought several sets but because I couldn't access the captions, I haven't watched them because of the accents. I generally have less trouble understanding the dialogue in older movies which don't have much background noise like traffic, etc."
1,Jane Austen Collection,It was nice to have all five of her books presented but the performances were like watching a play where the actors/actresses were given the lines to read just before they got in front of the cameras. Uninteresting. BBC production of Pride and Prejudice even better than the recently released movie.
2,sucks,i love the jane austen movies and odering this set was a great deal for me....but this isn't the set i haoped it would be. There was no desciption of the films in the set and the movie dates or actors. I was looking for different versons of these film and didn't know until i opened package that these weren't the ones i wanted. Now its late i have films that i wont really get use of or enjoy.
4,Jane Austen Collection,Jane Austen is my favorite author and this series was recommended to me by a friend. I haven't view all the series but I am looking forward to it.
2,Has the sixties look.,"I really liked Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion was true to the Austin book, but the casting wa strange, Emma and Mr. Knightley had no spark, Norlthanger Abbey was so badly cast and acted I could not watch more than a few minutes. Since that bad experience I have not had the desire to watch Mansfield Park, but will do so one day. On the whole, the collection was disappointing."
1,Very Disappointing,"I ordered this set after seeing Persuasion on PBS which I enjoyed very much. However, one learns that the BBC has a number of different versions of the Austen books out and they are not all created equal. This set with productions ranging from 1971 to 1987 is generally irritating and soap opera-ish because most of the scenes are shot live on a sound stage. The only one that we could actually watch to the end was Northanger Abbey which was mostly filmed on location and is the last made in the collection. So beware if you see an Austen version that you like, mark down the actors/actresses so you don't wind up with a different, inferior production!"
5,Quick delivery,DVD set arrived quickly and without any issues. My fiancee loved it too. Definitely future business with this vendor.
3,Jane Austen Collection,"Because I am a huge Jane Austen fan, the fact that this series is based on the BBC television productions gives me little pause although it is very time consuming each time an episode ends to see the same information over and over again waiting for the next episode. Anyone expecting a ""movie"" format will be very disappointed."
2,Not what I expected,I somehow didn't realize that these are the original and therefore old Jane Austen movies. They are still good though.
4,Satisfied Viewer,"This is a big series, there is a lot to review. Pride & Prejudice was delightful, I could watch it again. No, Jennifer Ehrle was not Lizzy, but I fell right in with the characters, never lacking in believability of flow or plot. Northanger Abbey was a shorter work and dreamlike; I haven't read the book, and the video made me want to. I liked Emma very much; everyone got their beau. Persuasion was a winner, I fell in love with the heroine, as was Mansfield Park. I haven't looked at Sense & Sensibility as yet. Looking forward to it. All in all, the characters were mostly (not entirely) unknown to me and that added to the effortless and pleasantry of the stories. I will watch these DVDs again and again, such is the power of Jane Austin and these well produced videos. Recommended."
3,Missing important information on the boxed set,"I bought this set unaware that these are all OLD film versions. Took getting used to. Today we are spoiled with glorious film technology, so you too may be shocked by how films looked in 1971 (Persuasion), 1972 (Emma), 1981 (Sense & Sensibility), 1983 (Mansfield Park), 1985 (Pride & Prejudice), and 1982 (Northanger Abbey). Once you get over that, you can enjoy the historical interest.If you're an Austen fan you'll still want to see, need to, prefer to see, the 1990s and the 2000 versions.Just be aware.As a collector, I still would have bought this set, but why don't the front of the CD labels clearly inform us of the year of production?"
1,Jane Austen Collection,"There are some issues with four of the DVD's. They would either skip scenes or the audio would be mute for sometimes as much as 15 minutes on some of them. I would like to return this for a refund.Thanks,Bill Tuten"
1,return of damaged goods,"five of the six dvd containers were defective and the dvd's were sliding around in them; quite audibly, i might add - - whoever was working in the warehouse to package this for shipping had to have heard them. B A D"
3,Depends on Your Taste,"I'm not a huge fan of teh way it's filmed. It has that raw footage quality as opposed to the clean cut of a typical movie, but this was a gift for my mom and she loves having them all in one set. Easier to keep track of."
2,jane austen collection,returned because was tv quality not motion picture.otherwise for the price a great deal for 6 janeausten stories.
1,Lack Luster Collection,"This collection of Jane Austin films is disappointing at best. They are filmed plays from the 60's and 70's. Poorly acted and badly directed. I would not give this collection to my local library, it is that bad."
5,Jane Austen's Collection,"This collection is absolutely perfect. It's charming in it's own way and perfect to watch on a rainy afternoon, though it can be watched at any time to receive perfect enjoyment!!!"
4,Jane Austen collection / cd's,"I had some of these from the eighties on videotape, and then again, somedifferent versions of the others. I liked the videotapes very much, butthey are degrading. These films are closer to the novel in most cases.Pride and Prejudice, this version, is my favorite. Persuasion, in myopinion is poorly done."
4,Book-like Version of Jane Austen's Best,"These versions of Jane Austen's stories keep more with the books, which means that they're not as dramatic. Even though they lack directorial presence, the actors in most of these stories are very persuasive as their characters, especially the supporting ones. Northanger Abbey was the least pleasing; it was as corny as a high school production. Pride & Prejudice was the best one because of the great cast; this is the one in which the supporting cast is better than all of the other versions I've seen, especially the mother. Well worth the money to a fan of Jane Austen."
5,Jane Austen Fan,I have enjoyed all these stories for years so whenever there is a movie version of them I am interested. There are more modern movie versions of most of Austen's books but these won't disappoint the true Jan Austen Fan.
4,Sense & Sensibility / Emma / Persuasion / Mansfield Park / Pride & Prejudice / Northanger Abbey,They were all good and very close to the books.
2,Disappointment,"These versions of Jane Austen's wonderful novels will leave viewers wondering why she ever got to be such a popular author. The acting is mostly wooden, allowing the jokes and character development to go unnoticed."
5,Gift for Mom,"I received the Jane Austen series in an incredibly timely manner, it is exactly what my Mom had requested, and the price was great too! We were both very pleased with this transaction!"
3,Very uneven,"Disappointed overall. Some were decent. Some were barely watchable. (Mansfield Park was embarrassingly bad, distorted beyond recognition. Even as an original idea, completely divorced from Austin's novel, it was terrible. Slave trade, debauchery, etc. -- pathetic.) Emma, in my opinion, was the best of the bunch, one of the best Emma's actually that I've seen. If I had it to do again, I would buy Emma as a single and let the others disintegrate on the shelves."
4,Jane Austen works 1985,"We have watched 4 of the 5 films so far and enjoyed 3 of them very much. The 1985 sound quality is not what it is now day with voices being dubbed, but BBC did a great job."
2,A set of listless versions,"This set is perhaps the most listlessly directed and cast version of Jane Austen ever. Except for Northanger Abbey, I found these dull and difficult to watch. Northanger Abbey has a pair of well cast leads, but it ends much too abruptly to give a feeling of satisfaction."
1,"Very, very, bad!!!","I have to agree with the one star reviewers....this set is soooo bad. I was so excited to have found the whole set, and BBC too. Oh dear. I'll try to sell it on ebay but if I can't (and I wouldn't be surprised if nobody wants it), I'll just throw it away - yes, it's THAT bad.Don't waste your money unless you like 1970's /80's stage acting with unrealistic costumes, sets and actors."
1,Horrible acting,I've only watched one of these. I can't even remember which one. It did not leave much on an impression. The acting is horrible. It was a waste of money.
5,collection available for other dvd regions,"As a big fan of Jane Austen, this collection is undoubtedly precious and i would be delighted to hear soon that it will be available also for other dvd regions beside USA and Canada."
1,Visual quality,"I would not recommend this collection. I watch these as much for the period costumes and room decors. I am keeping my VHS copies to see the carvings in the furniture and design of the wallpaper. For my eyes, the black is too black and the whites are too white in some DVDs. I prefer the VHS grey tones where I can take in the background while I am listening to the story line. I am selling the DVDs and keeping my VHS copies. I am disappointed with BBC as I have not had this problem with their DVDs before."
2,???,I cannot give any review to this product as I never received it even though I bought it end of november and the product was due to arrive on december 17th !!!I hope it will arrive at last... even if it is a little bit too late for a christmas present !!!
2,Jane Austin Movie Set,"I didn't realize that the actors were not the ones in the movies that I am used to watching. Still a good story, thanks to Jane Austen. The classics are still the classics."
3,"A bit disappointing, but still okay","This is not the Masterpeice Theater series that was on PBS a while back! Since PBS replays a lot of BBC productions, that was what I was expecting. These DVDs are a much older version and very, very, very British. It takes a while to get interested in each movie, but they are not too bad."
2,Disappointing,"Pride & Prejudice, of course, was excellent. That one's a classic, and difficult to match. Emma was nicely done, offering additional scenes not found in more modern adaptaions. The problem is, you're paying for 6 DVDs and getting about 2 that you'd watch more than once. These DVDs suffer from a terrible want of editing-long sequences with two sisters running up a hill giggling will not entertain many people for long. THe key scenes could have been developed more richly. We're Big Austen fans around here, but we wanted our money back after buying this set."
1,Laughably bad,"I haven't actually watched all of the movies in this collection, only Northanger Abbey (the only one I haven't see elsewhere.) It is SOOO bad. The acting, the makeup, the lighting, the directing, it's all horrible in every respect. I don't think I can bring myself to watch the others in this set, although it was a present from my husband. It makes the other adaptations I have on DVD seem so much better in comparison.Buy the 1996 BBC miniseries version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" with Colin Firth, the ""Emma"" with Gwyneth Paltrow, and the ""Sense & Sensibility"" 1995 version with Emma Thompson.) Trust me, they are worth every penny.If you like this genre, it's partly about the eye candy of the settings and the costumes and this collection is the opposite of eye candy."
2,More like watching staged plays than movies,"Jane Austen's novels transformed into movies are entertainment I can watch again and again. I was excited to find a collection of her work set to film and eager, very eager to watch them. But I found something lacking in the character portrayals, something less than convincing in the costuming and sets. Perhaps I've been spoiled by the brilliant productions that have been made of Mansfield Park, Emma, Sense & Sensibility and Persuasion in recent years, not to mention the wonderful A&E; production with Colin Firth as Mr. D'Arcy.I found this collection of Jane Austen work watchable, but not memorable."
3,Entertaining!,"This generously varied and very fun anthology of short parables by legendary authors of the past two centuries (from Edgar Allan Poe to Bob Dylan) is verily poetic. Philosophical stories loaded with magical realism and surrealism, and splendiferous humor and irony. The power of noun and verb is in full demonstration here. Interesting that these shorter pieces share characteristics of the writers’ longer works; in other words, their style and imprint are blessedly recognizable. It’s almost poetry, but unmistakably prose. A great bathroom reader."
4,still bumping,this is the Madonna era of music making that i still dig the most and Into the Groove was one of my cuts back in the day. Madonna vocally sounded on point and I dug the Production and the Punchy vibe of the cut.i dig the Grooves and the re-mixes. classic Madonna.
1,The song is classic. What you receive is not.,"If you are looking to receive this CD in a case with artwork, then DO NOT PURCHASE this item. You will receive the CD, however it only will come in a cardboard slip cover."
4,Includes my personal favorite.,"""The Case of the Sleepy Slayer* is my favorite Perry Mason episode. The plot is multi-layered, the characters interesting, and the very first scene features an extraordinary performance by Richard Hale as Uncle Abner."
4,Perry Mason - Eight Season. Vol. 1.,The same pattern of the other seasons of Perry Mason. Cannot say anothing more. I wish the last season to come soon!
2,Actors credits wrong!,Perry is the best!! The only problem is the credits give the wrong character names/actor names! How can you screw up something so simple. I guess somebody figured out a way. It really does not detract from the lovable characters I have been admiring for 50+ years.
2,Review of Maxell V-200 Wet Cleaner,"It cleans exceptionally well when it works, but many VCRs simply will not function with this cleaner. I have tried it several times on four (4) different VCRs. Three of them shut down rather quickly (both in 'play' and 'record' mode). Two of the four play better after only minimal use. But I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this product. I am afraid many VCRs will not work with this device."
4,good deal,VHS stuff is very hard to locate anymore no stores carry head cleaners . thought i would have to throw away my tape collection. The head cleaner worked great it was a real bargain
1,Maxwell Vp-2-00 VHS Wet Cleaner,"When I received my VHS cleaner, I inserted it, nothing came up, no window, nothingit ran for maybe 15 sec, and it ejected, . It did nothing. I tried rewinding it-- that did not work. So I just stopped trying.I do not recomend this product to anyone.tightwad75"
1,the only thing good-not much,"I received it, but that's the only thing good I can say. The liquid was all dried up. If you are some of the few of us that are left who are trying to preserve our VCRs, don't buy a wet head cleaner. Go for a dry one. Maxell is the best, but I haven't bout one through Amazon. I borrowed my parents' video head cleaner. Two other recommendations-tape on the slowest play-it eats up the hours on the tape, but you get a much better picture. And get a VCR rewinder."
4,Satisfied,The Maxell VCR HEAD CLEANERI am happy with the purchaseAfter using the product I see how much better the VCR perform
3,Good but...,"Sometimes it just simply doesn't work and you have to eject it and put it back in a couple of times, in the meantime the solution had already evaporated.When it works cleans perfect."
1,Doesn't Work. Period,It fits in a VCR and shuts it off. Doesn't do anything but jam the VCR and I had to power on and off just to eject this worthless thing.
4,VHS Cleaner,"I found this cleaner to work very well, If your player doesn't play after using this it will need a professional cleaning."
4,Cleans,cleaned my old vcr heads pretty good. quality of the tape playing after cleaning increased slightly enough to backup a good vcr tape to dvd
2,made the problem worse,I followed the instructions on the box and the results were not good. The VCR functioned worse than before I tried the cleaner tape. Too bad.
1,Decks don't like it,"I've tried this tape on three different makes of VHS decks, and they all reject it. Check your manual about cleaning before purchasing a cleaning tape."
1,Does not work for all machines,The wet Maxell VCR cleaner does not work for all machines. I have two VCR players and one TV/VCR combo. It only works for the TV/VCR combo. It did not work for the two VCR players when I used it either in the play mode nor the record mode.
1,Waste of Money,"I followed all the instructions, ran once but it did not clean head. Tried running several other times but just ejected and turned off VCR each time. Amazon does not allow returning this item because of ""hazardous material"" which I assume is the tiny amount of alcohol, so am out the cost of the cleaner. Not only am I disappointed by the product, I'm disappointed that Amazon dod not warn in advance that this item is not returnable."
3,Hard to say...,I was and still am having thumping noise whenever we use the VCR. This did nothing to help or fix the problem. Years ago I used a similar product with great results for a similar problem.... is it because the VCR is old or this cleaner???
5,worked wonderfully,The quality of the sound and video on my video tapes was horrible until I used this product. Now it is crystal clear.
5,Works as expected,"I needed this after playing some really old tapes on [2] of my VCRs, which essentially trashed play back on both.I chose this for the super saver shipping and the fact it seemed to work fine for other reviewers.After opening the package, the liquid bottle was well sealed and intact [had to pierce the opening which appeared to be sealed].Put a few drops in the drop window and ran it through all [3] of my VCRs ... it fixed the [2] problematic units straight away.The cleaning tape fed into the units just fine and there were no jams or hang ups.Overall, a functional product that works as advertised."
1,Would never suggest that anyone buy this,I tried this item multiple times on 3 different players. It did not work! It did not play in spite of trying all of the instructions. I would expect far more of Maxell. I would like my $ back but it is not worth the shipping and handling to send it. The VHS dry cleaner works fine as have all of the Maxell product that I have used in the past. This is a ripoff!
2,Disappointing,"I use these in a pocketknife (Gerber 22-41830 EAB Pocket Knife, Exchange A Blade).They perform well ... for awhile.My main complaint is that they dull very rapidly; I've gotten much better results with the higher end ""titanium"" coated blades.One nice thing about the serrated blades is that the notches make cutting string/twine substantially easier; also, one of these blades, when dull, is much more useful than a standard ""straight"" blade that's dull."
5,good utility blade,This is a great utility blade due to the fact that it has a unique serrated edge.
3,Best Heavy metal Album in the world Ever,While the songs themsleves were good there seemed to be slight different quality in the recordings that was a bit annoying. I have many compilations where even old tin like sounds were re remastered. They could have done better.
1,CONFUSED???,HOW CAN THIS BE CALLED THE BEST HEAVY METAL ALBUM EVER WITH RUN DMC ON THE TRACK LIST .. Give me a break !!!
5,Peaceful music,"I first listened to this CD in a friends car. I purchased it for my daughter because she is bilingual. After listening to it again, you don't have to understand the words to enjoy the peaceful, beautiful music you'll hear."
2,"Despite their reputation, this volume didn't do the trick...","I'm in the advanced planning stages for my trip to Northern Italy and I was hoping this edition would provide useful information and insight for me. Unfortunately, for all its listings, this book is remarkable in its LACK of detail. It might come in somewhat handy once you're ON the trip, but does little to help you prepare for it.Also, in trying to cover such vast regions of the area, the individual cities and villages are under reported."
1,Useless Book!,"I bought this book to help me plan my first trip to Maine. I plan to return it tomorrow. The majority of this book is lists of hotels and restaurants. There are lots of activities and sights listed as well. The problem is that the author does not distinguish between any of them. Every place is just listed with a short description. It is impossible for someone like me, who has never been to Maine, to determine which parts of Maine I should visit and what I should do while I'm there. I am a frequent traveller, and I have never seen a worse tour book."
2,bgdglvr23,"I bought this a long time ago and wasn't thrilled sounded better than it was, music was kind of depressing."
1,Call quality is poor,"I have had these phones for a few months and we are already replacing them. The audio quality is very poor and you are constantly asking the caller to repeat things or speak up. There is also a steady white noise in the ear piece.Look elsewhere, these are not worth it."
1,Good Albums Ain't What They Used To Be!!!,"This is a very disappointing CD from a guy who has done much better work. My least favourite song on this album would have to be ""Slow Down Georgie (She's Poison)"" which seems to have mysoginistic overtones about a guy who is lucky to find the girl of his dreams. Elton sings ""Breaking Hearts Ain't What It Used To Be "" and I say Elton's albums ain't what they used to be."
5,great album,"This is a great, very under rated album. There are so many good songs that are on this album. There are a lot of good elton john song you here all the time on the radio but there only seems to be less than ten songs that are really played. Theres songs are great songs that you will only here if you buy this album."
3,A good little book,"This is a good little book for children or a beginning cook looking for Russian flavour. But honestly, the price was a bit much for a book with less than 50 pages and less than 2 dozen recipes. You can find the same recipes in the larger books.....plus many others, for less money.The one plus this book gets over the others is that it has pictures. Lots of pictures. If you aren't hungry when you get the book you will be after you open it!"
2,Very basic and lots of sweets,"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is not great and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. Contains some instantly recognisable such as borscht and stroganoff, but has far too many appetiser and sweet dishes, also a couple of wasted recipes such as a page on how to boil a sausage.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."
3,"Good, not great","The Elmo wiggles and giggles as promised, but our 1 and 3 year old kids have been less than enamored with it. It only jiggles/wiggles for a few seconds at a time, and from a parent's perspective, it isn't especially sturdy. The chair is much lighter than expected, is much less well-stuffed than expected, and as a result, it doesn't provide much support, even for a small child. Good, not great. Three stars may even be a bit generous. (Our Tickle Me Elmo is getting a lot more play.)"
4,My 1-year old granddaughter loves it,"I got this as a gift for my 1-year old granddaughter. My daughter says she loves it. She keeps coming back and sitting down in it to feel it giggle and shake.Probably could have been packed a little better. It was just loose in the box, but it was OK."
3,not great for children with special needs,"are links allowed here? my full review is here: [...]but here is a summary (specific to children with special needs and/or looking for a sensory experience)proschair is adorable and classic Elmo funfur is soft and workmanship makes for a lasting productshake and giggle features work and are entertainingconspliability of chair means it is unstable for some childrenvibration cannot provide a sensory experience when the child slips outsize of chair + unusable = takes up precious storage spaceverdictin the ""off"" mode our 5 pound Yorkie loves to use the Elmo chair as a bed"
1,Elmo rollover chair,"My 16 month old daughter sat in this chair twice and it rolled over faster than an American SUV, resulting in a black eye. The chair has no support on the sides, meaning the arms of the chair offer no support or stability. My guess for the reason that it tips over so easily is that it has no ballast or weight to it. Maybe something was wrong with this chair, but I don't think I would buy this product."
5,Love it ! but WAY cheaper at WalMart,I bought this at WalMart for $35 the other night. since the minute he was brought in from the car my 16month old has been fascinated ! she loves it like crazy! I'd reccomend.
2,A college kid's opinion...,"This book was a required read for American Federal Government at the University of Oklahoma during the spring 2000 semester. I found this book to be a very dry and overly technical read. Upon completing this book, I had gained absolutely no factual information concerning the operating mechanics of American managed care. The book was very well written and structured, but as a student of the physical sciences, I found the omnipresence of members of the ever-growing list of medical acronyms to be overwhelming. I strongly recommend that the reader have some familiarity with the American managed care system and/or the medical profession in order to enjoy this book to its fullest extent."
3,They Don't Taste Too Good but They Make My Throat Feel Better!,I use Halls Menthol-Lyptus throat drops but not for a cough suppressant when I have a cold but for when my allergies make my throat itchy and I find that it helps to relieve my sore itchy throat and this Honey Lemon flavor though still tasting mediciney like the other flavors is much better tasting then the cherry flavor and the regular flavor!
1,all glam no substance,sherry has had her relatives and staff write these glowing reviews you see before you. she also gets her staff to write most everything else for her so why stop now?
2,A good night read,"If Sominex hasn't done the trick. If you find your self tossing and turning at night, Sherry cooper writes the perfect cure. I dont think I lasted more than 6 minutes before I found myself in a pool of drool some 3 or 6 hours later. Imsomniacs cure. Ride the wave to zzzzzzzzz."
5,A Great RIDE!,"Who says economics is boring....not the way Sherry writes, an easy read for us non-economists...thanks Sherry!"
5,"Excellent skin, fits like a glove","This was exactly what I was looking for, it allows protection to the phone's case without restricting functionality."
2,Too wide,Paper quality is good but it is too wide causing it to bend during fitment so there is an opening that causes air to go unfiltered.I cut it a little bit to make fit.
4,It's about time rock comes back to life!,"TerraFirma's music brings back the good old rock days when music is taken seriously and the lyrics makes sense. Their sound brings back the memory of Styx, Foreigner, Yes and other bands like these where great vocals and musicianship are not taken for granted. The sound is all their own with a lot of heart. ""It Is What Is Is"" is a great CD to add to any music enthusiasts collection."
5,Buy both of them but sell part 2!,I agree that Sandlot 1 is a classic but part 2 doesn't seem to belong. I just didn't like the sequel as much as the first but the first one you must keep do not keep 2 just give it away once you buy the pack.
3,i remember the first,"i'll alwasy reemmber the first, the 2nd not as good as first but my nieces, nephews still liked it"
1,?FAMILY FUN? ?FAMILY FEATURE? (zero star),"I do not understand how a movie can be deemed for the family with words like SH** etc, in it. What kind of ""FAMILY"" thinks profanity is OK? Not just profanity but profanity coming from CHILDREN!!!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! or what? No, I did not complete even the first movie once I heard the ""S"" word. I was afraid to even play the second one. So I am out of the cost of the two DVD's. The only thing they are fit for is the garbage.Thank you for this opportunity."
1,"Come on, they are giving us the same movie in 2 cases.","Sandlot 1 is a true classic but part 2 is horrible. It just makes the box set even more trashy because it also comes with part 1. Part 2 is almost the same exact thing and the first. [see the movie and you will know what I mean.] I say just buy the original and don't even look at the second no matter what kind of fan you are or how tempted you may get. Might as well sell this movie and just copy it and put it in the set with a new cover, add some new characters and kiss the box before you ship it out. The director hangs his head in shame over this one."
2,From Grave to Death,"As my 1998 collection of poems was entitled ""Grave of an Amiable Child,"" this title naturally caught my eye. It's a well-meaning, idealistic attempt to make reading about (and remedying)deplorable urban conditions more immediate in the dramatic context of a mystery. Unfortunately, it's very over-loaded on good intentions (interfaith marriage, interracial adoption, etc.), and it doesn't sound as if the author knew the neighborhood well.It's a good summer beach book, though."
4,What great look!,"Award winning WLBT-TV weather anchor and filmmaker Walt Grayson offers a loving, personal look at the river country of Mississippi. The historic section includes Port Gibson, a town General Grant said was too pretty to burn, Natchez, the wealthiest and most infamous antebellum American city, and Vicksburg, where the famous battle was fought. Covered here are the antebellum mansions, country waterfalls, oddball mailboxes, lovely abandoned churches and cemeteries, the abandoned ghost town of Rodney, and most interestingly, the little known history of Woodville, where the Old Southwest really began. Grayson's narrative is down home all the way, and this will make the perfect Christmas present for those who love stories and beautiful color photos to back them up."

4,Good but not completely accurate,"The title includes ""floor standing"". Something this small will almost never be used on the floor - maybe outside for long shots. This is a table-top tripod."
1,Less than adequate quality,Mine lasted about 4 months before the pot-metal nut embedded in the pan head stripped and the handle came off in my hand.
3,Not great as a spotting scope tripod,"I bought this item to use as a tripod for my spotting scope during rifle sports. This tripod is not quite hearty enough for that purpose. I'm sure it would be fine for photographic use, as it seems to have many adjustments. My complaint is that the handle extends in the same direction as my spotting scope's eyepiece, so when I look through the spotting scope my chin hits the handle and bumps the image around."
5,Sturdy and versatile tripod,"I need a way to mount cameras close to the ground and perform a full range of pan and tilt moves, and this is the only tripod I've found that enables that. It can even be counter-sunk to bring the pan/tilt head closer to ground level if necessary (by digging a small hole and setting the collapsed tripod into a cup). It's very sturdy, especially with the suction cup in the center post, and a very good purchase at this price."
4,A very versatile item!,"I purchased this tripod to use as a sturdy, table-top tripod. I love the three-way pan head. Basically, it functions like any normal lightweight tripod, but it is much shorter. I had tried a couple of table-top tripods with my Sony a700 DSLR, but found that they were too light to handle the weight of a full-size camera and lens. This one is MUCH more sturdy! The legs telescope out making the height about 15"" or so. There are knobs for adjusting for horizontal panning and tilt. And, the camera platform pivots out so you can take vertical photos without removing the camera. As an added bonus, there is a level built into the platform. If I had to post any concern or negativity...it would be that the legs ""splay"" out some when a camera is attached...it's not a big concern or anything, but worth mentioning. All in all, the convenience of this small, sturdy tripod makes it WAY better than dragging out the big one for small photo projects...such as macro work, slide copying, etc."
4,reliable,"the Sunpack QSX mini is a great tripod for my traveling. It great mobility, and can attach to almost any surface"
2,Not what I expected........,"The first two chapters kept my interest, but then, I became bored. I hate it when I don't finish a book, but this was too dry to me. I felt there wasn't enough instruction on overcoming the fears. I also tired of all of the excerpts from other books. It seemed on every page there was another excerpt from another author's book. Call me picky, I just couldn't get into it."
4,Catastrophes & Pitchforks,"This is a wonderful book! Mr. Schwartz bears his soul in this memoir of a sad, yet truly extraordinary life."
5,nothing ever goes away,"when i was stressed out in medical school in brooklyn, i think jonathan schwartz saved my life. by that time, he was on the nytimes station, wqew, but his voice and his show were similar to the show he had on wnew. in his memoir, i hear the same distinctive voice and gift for storytelling that his show featured. in the age when radio was turning fom disc jockeys to programmers, he was a singular talent. and the music he introduced me to! sinatra, garland, cole, fitzgerald, nancy lamott, etc singing gershwin, cole porter, berlin, rodgers & hart. most of all, he intorduced me to nelson riddle and the idea that arrangements matter a great deal.he attracted many fans, including the voice of the mets, tim mc carver. and as a met fan, it made it all the more personal to me. i thought his memoir was wonderful, and yes, singular. as was his life story. all of it. i loved every word."
2,Whiny Autobiography,"Several times during my reading of this book I said to myself, ""This is one weird kid.""As so many other people in these reviews stated, Jonathan Schwartz is a great singer and DJ with a huge knowledge of his subject. But he comes across to me as thoroughly unlikeable in this book.A good deal of the book talks about how terrible things have been , yet he never lacked for money. His dad and stepmom may have been quite odd (or eveil, in his stepmom's case), but he never lacked any material things.Speaking of odd, didn't they take pictures in the Schwartz house? None are in this book, I would have liked to see some of his dad.BTW, didn't Jonathan have one friend in any of the schools he went to?"
4,Surprising revelations,"I have listened to Jonathan Schwartz since soon after he began on WNEW-AM. Sunday mornings were not complete without Jonathan's voice, his music and his stories. I loved the book. I know it's a cliche but I couldn't put it down. I can't agree with the reviewer who said you didn't have to know Jonathan to enjoy his story. It is all the more poignant to read of his lonely childhood when you know the man he became and I'm glad I didn't know the tragic details of his life so I could just enjoy his radio persona. I just assumed he had sprung full-grown into the music guru, wise and witty, that I heard on the air every Sunday. It was delicious fun to hear about his relationship/non-relationship with Sinatra. Read this book...you will love it."
4,surprisingly moving,"As a 50 year old guy who grew up in New York, Jonathan Schwartz' unique voice and delivery were drummed into my head at a time when the FM radio band underwent a revolution, and I went through adolescence. Later, JS made quite a name for himself as a lover of Sinatra, and other great American songbook crooners. I always assumed he was something of a phoney, cashing in on a more mature sound when album oriented rock died away. This book, in a surprisingly moving fashion, tells his story as being a lover of the Great American Songbook from his early youth. It is quite an interesting read, sort of a non-fiction Holden Caulfield, with lots of true vignettes about celebrity friends of his father, songwriter-Broadway producer Arthur Schwartz. The chapters dealing with Jonathan's mother's death, and his brief stay in a psychiatric facility proved to me that JS is no phoney at all. He's a part of the New York scene."
2,A fall from previous form,"Same characters, less flavor, less humor, less tension, less substance to the plot. Is EC tired of Waterdeep's limitations?Waterdeep's setting has its own flaws, but it cannot be blamed for the lack of a dominant theme in this story. It seemed at first that EC was addressing the contemporary problem of psychoactive drugs, but that got lost about halfway through the book, as did most plot threads. Since when did Evermeet gryphon riders hire out as caravan guards? A more plausible explanation for their presence would have been nice. Cassandra Thann? Is EC trying to say that we never really know our own parents? Perhaps true, but clumsily handled. Her stories are usually more tightly written, and I missed Danilo's normally droll wit.They can't all be gems. This exception may prove the rule, as EC usually spins a well woven yarn."
2,2 and 1/2 stars,"This an acceptable entry level book to fantasy, it doesn't have any real depth or much in the way of originality. If your looking for a moderately enjoyable book that you can blow through in an evening then its right up your alley.Cunningham shows some promise, but she tends to be lazy it seems. This book had some fairly decent ideas, but what could have been a stellar story instead just left me wondering ""that's all?'."
2,I struggled through this one.,"As a big fan of the Forgotten Realms, I am pretty much willing to read anything from this genre. This book, however, was a struggle to get through. BORING! I could only read a few pages at a time before falling asleep. I do have a few more books from the Harpers series to get through, so maybe my outlook will improve after becoming more familiar with the characters. When I read a Forgotten Realms novel, I want battles and conflict not mystery and intrigue. If I wanted that I'd start reading Dean Koontz (UGH!)"
5,"Not the best of the series, but one truly good book!","Finally, Arilyn, Danilo and Elaith are back. I was not disappointed. Elaine Cunningham's novels often evolve around mystery, intrigue and plotting, and this one is no exception. The plot is very deep and complex and will grab the reader's attention. We finally see the relationship between Dan and Arilyn evolve (although I must confess I prefered it when they were bickering in Elfshadow, hehe), and The Serpent is back, so we can expect some exciting events ^_^. I was thrilled with the development of Elaith's character, especially near the end. The addition of Thorhold characters was a good idea too (so reading it isn't recommanded unless you read Thornhold, as well as the previous books with Arilyn and Danilo obviously). A sequel to this novel is needed. How about bringing back Lucia Thione, and showing how Elaith prevails with the forest elves? }=)"
4,Perfect for the experienced E. Cunningham reader...,"Definately not for a first time reader. It would be confusing to someone not previously introduced to the characters within. However, it gives wonderfull insight into some of my favorite characters. Elaith's character has always been interesting but always been left a mystery. In *Elfsong* you got to understand his character, but never the reasons for his behavior. In this book, you get those explanations. The plot was twisted and full of surprises at the end. Elaine showes a lot of growth in her characters in this edition."
3,not nearly as good as season1,"This season is decent but no where near as good as season 1. Almost everything that happened in season1 happens in season2. They build the same stuff, they get attacked by marauders, they get attacked when they go and savage for stuff in other areas.And these actors are plain annoying and most of them are hideous. Amber and Michael may be the most freakiest and ugly people on tv.And i don't understand why ticker was hiding in bushes for half the season.This show is not real like it says it is, its all staged. If you don't believe me than how did jim find the painting made by his kids? Out of all the places to go they go to the gas station and there is the painting.And why the hell is reno always walking with no shirt on? Grow up."
4,Colony Season 2,"Completely different from the first season. This season they got more regular people without skills (no engineers, no doctors, nurses, etc.). The people were hysterical & it was especially difficult to take it seriously with Becca, the model, worrying about washing her hair. *It's the apocalypse sweetie, no one cares about your hair!* This cast was also faced with way more aggressive situations and actually got some help a little later on just because they were doing so poorly... Definitely entertaining and it was still interesting watching the technology they developed to get out of the situation. Recommend!"
3,so/so,i liked it for what it stood for but the fist season was way better...the people on this one kinda erked me...but oh well
5,"Amazing show, and better than the first season!","I love this show! And this season is way better than the first, since the first season they might as well have put the most suited people to survive in that environment as possible, where this season seems like they are more realistic people to put in there. I do like the first season a lot as well, but I imagine if you are looking at reviews for season two, you have probably seen season one and are wondering if they made the show better. And the answer to that is yes, yes they did. Give us season three!"
3,The Colony Season Two,"I was disappointed to find the online videos of the behind the scenes interviews were not added to the DVD.Instead, deleted scenes, which are often cut b/c they are useless time wasting scenes, are added as the bonus.This season offered more practical survival lessons, yet some were not shown, but are available online only.I am glad to own it, despite being able to watch it, whenever a WiFi signal is available... but I was hoping to see more of Tick's behind the scenes."
4,"Great program, but...","...they changed the ending of the final episode with editing. Spoiled a great twist. Other than that, it was an informative and enlightening show. Not quite as good as Season 1, but still very worthwhile."
3,still too controlled but great info pickups...,you can always grab a couple of things and nifty ideas from these series... waiting to see the try and make it in the country
2,Just Ok,"Shipped quickly and adequately packed. Thin material; poorly trimmed mold flashing. Not easily fitted to 4"" downspout as it leaves little contact area between the adapter and the downspout. I suggest you buy the proper size for your downspouts."
3,"Good, but not her best","An engaging and entertaining read, but not as good as Bujold's science fiction."
4,Definitely enjoyable,"Not Ms. Bujold's best work, but still an enjoyable read in a little-used setting. If you're a fan, worth getting."
4,The Spirit Ring,This book is a good read fast and easy and the cast of caracters was not confusing. I recommend to anyone.
3,Nice Average Fiction,"I am having a real problem with this one. On one hand I know it is a relatively simplistic tale, with an average story line and mediocre characters. The dialogue seems forced sometimes and a bit, well, underdone at others. So what is my problem?I really like it! I mean I had fun with this story. Even with its problems I enjoyed reading it, several times as a matter of fact. I enjoyed the interaction of the characters, the budding romance, the mixture of religion and magic.Dispassionately looking at this book it really doesn't rate anything above a 3, but if I were rating on my enjoyment alone it would easily be a 4 or maybe even a 5. This seems to be written with a younger audience in mind and should be classified as young adult or juvenile fiction. No sex, little violence and a quick read. If you like fantasy, especially young adult type of fantasy I think you will like this.Highly recommended."
2,A disappointment,"If you are a fan of ms. Bujold's Vorkosigan books, don't bother with this one. This book is an attempt to write serious fantasy, but its attention of details on medevial time Italy crosses the line to boring. I really tried to like it, but I can't stand it when the main characters are fools.Loan this from a friend or try to read few pages before bying this."
3,Not an Honor Harrington story,"Only three stars this time. The book was actually quite good, but from the writer of the Honor Harrington series, one waits a bit more. I apologize from Lois McMaster Bujold, but when compared with the rest of her/his (?) books this one really was not among the best. From some unknown writer I probably would have given at least one star more. The characters are less sympatehic and the story moves with a very slow pace the first half of the book. Still a nice story with a happy ending. Don't regret buying it, just hoped for something more."
2,Disappointing,"Having read many books by Emmett Fox, I was very disappointed by the layout and minimal amount of information in a book for this price. Save your money and don't buy this one. Around The World in 365 Days and so many other books by (it must be) a different publisher are more professionally done and offer significantly more information."
2,EXPECTING BETTER CONDITION,"Expected the book to be in better condition. If I had known it was in the condition it was, I would have paid more for a better copy."
1,ink cartridge,wheni received two cartridges i put it in my hp printer and the ink is dried up. i do not recommend this product.
2,Not sure.,For some reason I tried to use this in my printer but it would not recognize my machine. I buy the same ones at Costco and never had a problem. Not sure what went wrong. Dud!
1,waste of time and ink,you I think you'd be betta off buying and brand new ink cartridge the life span on these cartridges is as big as a grain of salt
1,didn't work with my printer,installation was fine but for whatever reason my Deskjet did not recognize it after the first few print jobs.
3,Pre use Review,"This black ink cartridge was bought as a back up for a new printer. It looks OK and no doubt will perform satisfactorily. However, I do not understand why the black cartridge and the tri-color item and the printer all have to come from different suppliers. This makes for disproportionately high packing and posting costs. However, the convenience of shopping on line partly compensates for cost disadvantages."
3,Go for the hp 96 instead,"The HP 96 is the same cartridge, but it holds more ink, and depending on the price you pay, is usually more economical."
1,ink,I won't order ink again.....dry/not usable.I just disposed of the product. I then purchased the same ink from a local store without any hassle.
1,Ran out of Ink with less than 50 copies made.,"Very disappointed with this product. Ink did not last through less than 50 copies.HP ink is so expensive, but I have a Hewlet-Packard Printer and so I have no choice but to use HP Ink. I am thinking seriously about buying a new kind of printer; one whose ink is not so costly and the ink lasts longer."
4,Printewr ink,Just what I expected - what else is there to say about it? This rating set-up is a pain for me
1,this seller sucks,This seller never send my product and never gave me a return either for my money. Do not order from this person ever!
2,Why buy online?,"You can purchase a 2 pack of these same ink cartridges at office depot or a majority of other stores for around 34.00. Even if they are selling online for 17-18 bucks a piece, the shipping hurts the price. IMO, go to the store and save yourself about 5-10 bucks."
2,Sinatra-Basie album,"I am so disappointed in the songs on this album. If I had known what songs were on this CD, I'd never have bought it. A great singer, superb band, and great arrangements couldn't do much with songs like ""Looking at the World Thru Rose Colored Glasses,"" ""Love is a Tender Trap,"" etc. I wish ""My Kind of Girl"" had been ""My Kind of Town"""
5,fantastic,"Great Basie-type versions of great old standards. He had a swing that was remarkable, and when paired with Sinatra---it is delicious to the ears. The cleaned-up digital version makes the experience that much better."
4,An historic musical first,"The first Frank Sinatra and Count Basie collaboration resulted in a terrific album. Many of the songs here had been recorded by Sinatra before, but they are given new arrangements here. The Basie big band sound works really well with Sinatra's voice. Sinatra's fans should dig this album."
3,Ecstasy's Fancy by Wanda Owen,"Fancy knew Nicholas for a charming devil with a reputation for breaking hearts. Though he knew she was an innocent child unspoiled by desire or ambition, her soft yielding body urged him toward passion's flame, and he vowed to forever possess . . . ECSTASY'S FANCY"
5,Bought these as a back up for our smoke detectors,We like to keep a couple 9v batteries around for when the smoke detectors need battery replacements. I checked all over found the Maxell 9 Volt battery to be the best deal around for a name brand.
2,Didn't Help,I bought this CD and Book before a major surgery last summer and it didn't really help. I listened to it religiously prior to surgery and it was actually annoying. I got major panic attacks 3 weeks post surgery. I think the best thing before surgery is just to be knowledgeable about your surgery and dont try and put yourself in any unrealistic state as it only prolongs your acceptance of the surgery and recovery afterward. Save your money for comfortable slippers and a robe!
3,Not as good as...,"A better CD is by Belleruth Napersak. The book was pretty good, however. I used this and Belleruth to prepare for my surgery and I went in and came out of surgery fabulously!!"
5,Most informative and helpful,"I bought three different surgery CD's because my husband and I were both having surgery in the same month. Although all of them were good, I thought this one was the most informative. There is a radio interview on the first disc that contains lots of information from her book. I liked her voice and guided imagery as well. One version has a heart beat in the background that progressively slows down to help you relax. I liked it. But my husband prefered the version without the heartbeat. She also advises you to ask your friends and family to send you loving energy the day of your surgery and that research shows that improves outcome. I sent out an email two days before my surgery and I found people's good wishes very helpful to me. Now one month post-opt my husband and I are doing great. I think the CDs did help."
4,Relaxation/Healing CD plus instructional CD,"CD arrive in good condition. It really puts you in relax mode. It has like 3 different tracks, just wish there was more variations between the tracks. Instructional CD not need it, if you got the book it just repeats some info that its already in the book."
5,A cd for everyone!,This is a great CD encouraging the listener to view & think of situations from a positive perspective making our decisions and throught processes pro-active for our own betterment. Have recommended & giifted this CD & accompanying book to people who have truly benefited from them! Thank you Peggy!!!
4,Reliable Drives,"I own three of these Rocket Pod drives and I like them a lot. My only gripe is the very loud fan noise in the newer generations. My first drive is whisper quite, but both of the new ones are so loud that I only use them for backup and turn them off when not in use."
4,Great product,"I have had my rocket pod since Aug 2003, granted its only 120GB and at that time you were paying over one dollar per GB. The fact that I ran this almost 24/7 or at least 15/7, since 2003 without any issues. I have never lost data and the file transfer speed is still the same.Only issue now is that its filled with dust over the years and have no way of getting it open to clean it out so the fan isn't so loud."
3,OK but don't leave on,I have had 3 and 2 have failed so far as they have gotten very hot and have seized up on me. The stacking feature has been fantastic but reliability under continuous usage has been less than ideal in my case.
3,OK,"I picked up this program from the local store and checked it out a couple times...Eventually I bought it, and it is not what I expected. The program claims to have the same feel as a real amp and little delay time. It also claims to be able to record what you play. So I installed it, and noticed instantly that there is a bad delay. I'm running a pretty quick little Sony VAIO with Windows XP so you can't blame the hardware. Next, I'm looking for a record feature. It does not exist! The product website disagrees with me, but it is not included in this program. Other than these issues, it is a very good quality program, but I personally do not find it to be worth the 80 bucks you'll have to pay for it..."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book as it was recommended as part of Sonlight's Language Arts program for first grade. I am extremely disappointed with this book. It might be a good book for preschoolers, but I found nothing of any use in the book for my first grader. Not sure why Sonlight (who normally offers material that I consider a little advanced for the recommended age) would suggest this book as part of a curriculum for 6,7&8 year olds. In addition, many parts of the book are extremely dated and virtually useless."
1,Terribly racist,"This is an unsupportable, one-sided view of Japanese-Americans as the enemy of the United States during WWII and even today. I had to read this for a term paper and it is really difficult to get through because it is so unfair and prejudiced against all Japanese-American people. Do not support this racist propaganda."
