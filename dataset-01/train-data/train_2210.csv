3,good not great,"I feel like the view of Miriam van Scott's book is too condemning of most thing. She places in Hell Hollywood movies which we all know are works of fiction. She places a religious right view on her book and is too critical of great works of literature. The Aenid by Virgil was commissioned Augustus Cesear after the destructive civil war. It had nothing to do with hell, but because of mythological imagery it has to be Satan's work. She is overally critical of Hinduism and Jainism and Buddhism and that is why there is religious indifference in this world. Her mind is closed. I don't recommend this book unless the reader's mind is closed too."
1,Not Available,I've tried to order this book twice and both times I was under the impression the book was in stock only to receive an email a day or two later stating the book was unavailable until further notice. Please post something stating the current availability of the products so the customers are not wasting their time.
5,Its Media - If you like Media . . .,"I first found this book on the shelves of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary Bible study reference section. After using it and know that I would soon move very far away I purchased it for posterity. This has been a helpful purpose.It is written at the popular level and is a very easy read. Whereas there are works which you can consult for in depth studies, there is a place for brief texts such as this one.If you are interested in a complimation in the form of a dictionary of many different forms of media dealing with hell - this is the book you should buy.The breadth of coverage can be illustrated using some of the names of articles. ""Hell Mouth"" ""Clive Barker"" ""Dante"" . The movies, art, TV, literature - what ever has hell in its eye, you may see it in this book. If nothing else it is a conversation starter."
2,I was very disappointed in that the CD-ROM wasn't up to par.,"I too purchased this book in the hopes of learning Photoshop, but I was very disappointed that the CD-ROM did not have some of the files that the book called for. I did get some of the files from Macmillan Technical Support,but now that I'm working in chapter 11, I again find that I am missing files. I can say with all honesty that I would not recommend this book."
5,"No review, have not read. However ....",Can you artisans recommend a quality book for beginners of Photoshop? Suggestions please.
4,Before the Great Love Story !,"Prelude is generically a number of remixes, For example 'She's my lover' appears on A Grand Love Story. Kid Loco as usual remixes up to top standard. Personally I would go for A Grand Love Story."
2,get the import,"This was a dissapointment,it is well worth spending the extra money to get the import,which is a great listen."
4,Prelude to...,"This is my first kid loco cd to buy, I'm satisfied... I didn't get to hear much of it before I bought it... it kind of has a touch of reggae in it... but other than that it's pretty hoppy... it sounds like music that I would put as a score for a movie... thank you for your time.."
1,No light,Tried to use in a closet. They did not have much light. Had to buy something else which gave enough light.
4,works pretty good,"Single LED so don't expect a huge output, but the three combined i was able to light up pretty well a storage closet."
1,night light,they are great to peel and stick where you want them but very bad for lighting and they don't last long put it up one night and down the next.
5,Get the job done,I recently redid my closet and unfortunately I do not have any electric in it. I bought 2 packs of these LED lights and they work great. So far I have only put 2 in the closet but I will probably put 2 more. They don't give off a great deal of light and beam is fairly concentrated but overall I am happy with them. The closet is about 4 ft by 3 ft. I will probably put a couple under one set of my kitchen cabinets as well.
3,Only 2 our of 3 worked. Not the sturdiest build,"These LED lights emit a bright white light and the battery life is very good. The adhesive backs stuck well to the bottom of some shelves painted with a high gloss paint just fine. The only problem is, only two out of three of the lights worked. After a few months use, the push action used to turn the lights on and off also start to stick and become a little less dependable. Sometimes I have to pop them kind of hard to get them to turn on or off.Overall, its an inexpensive product and the quality is about on par with what you're paying."
3,Stick N Click - Not as I expected,"Not what I expected; however, 'As Seen on TV Guys' (that I purchased from) have great customer sevice & communication (not to mention less expensive than if you bought from infomercial!)...Would'nt recommend this product for my purposes, but highly recommend this Company for their great customer service!Will definatly buy from them again!"
1,poor,I have purchased these lights before and they worked great. This time none of the lights worked.
1,Disappointed,A lot smaller than I thought. Light not very bright. Big disappointment. Should have ordered the original Tap Light. Waste of money.
3,Not bright,"I was slighty disappointed when I turned this light on, it's not very bright. We have a small display cabinet at work, I put all three on the top inside, and you could barely tell there was a light on. This may work for a very small space, like a shelf in a closet."
5,This handy light can go anywhere!,"The Stick & Click lights are a real lifesaver. I put them in places where I need light at night, but I don't want to wake anyone up. I have one above my computer keyboard and I can email all night if I want to! Great item- I wish I had invented it!!"
3,"They are really nice, but .......","How do you remove them from your wall? I would like to re-position some of these lights, but how do you remove the lights from the wall with out destroying the wall?. Thanks for anyone who can tell me!"
3,Not bright enough,"They are the perfect size to hide under the counter. But the light is Blue, for what I needed Yellow whould have been better.The battery also dies quickley."
2,Overrated,"I read all the reviews and thought these would be really good. Well, they aren't. You would need to use all three together in one spot or they don't light up enough to see anything. I guess if you wanted to use them for mood lighting they would be okay."
2,not bright enough,"some of the reviews address this issue but i gave it a try anyway. we wanted to use these under our cabinets for a little more light in the kitchen, well that's not working. these lights give off a very faint beam and even with all three together in the same area it's still not enough light to help. may be useful as a night light or somewhere completely dark but definitely not for kitchen."
2,"Better than a candle, but not much","If you just need a really dim gleam to show you the way to a REAL light, these are for you. I bought them to light a bookcase at work where my phone is. I couldn't see the display on the phone and needed a little light. And a little light is what I got. Granted, it's doing the job...sort of...as long as the phone is angled just right to fall under the narrow beam of light. But as to lighting up the shelf? Not even close. Don't know yet how much they eat up batteries...I've only been using them for a little while...but I turn it off when I don't need it and only turn it on when the phone rings or I need to dial out. The price is right, though... But if you really need some light, look elsewhere."
3,Not very bright,"I got these to put some simple light into a china cabinet. I didn't think I needed anything very bright and there is no outlet close by to plug-in a real light set-up. I just open these out of the plastic, put batteries in and tried them in the cabinet. Even with the blinds drawn and the room pretty dark, the light was very dim. a light attached to the roof of the cabinet didn't really illuminate the top shelf, 10 inches away, let alone filter through the glass shelf. I doubt that all three together would provide enough light for one small part of the cabinet. Maybe these put out enough light to be helpful other places, but as a simple highlight, in a room that would be generally lit up (we'd only use the lights when guests are over to see our china) they are pointless. Hard to give them a good rating, though to be fair they are described as ""LED gives off bright white light"" White, yes, Bright, hardly."
2,Very dim,"I put these in my storage unit. They have a bad color so the light they throw gives everything a bad shade.They are also very dim, not nearly as much light as they are advertised as having. They are better than nothing, but I'm sure there are better lights like this out there."
1,Amazingly uncreative,"On this album, Ricardo Montaner goes back and re-records his greatest hits, this time with the Metropolitan Orchestra backing him up. What kind of imagination does it take to re-record your hits? None at all. And Ricardo's voice doesn't sound as pure and strong as it used to. I would say this disc was for fans only, but I'm a fan and was very disappointed. Another Venezuelan singer-songwriter who is about the same age, Franco De Vita, is still offering fresh, creative ideas. Better to check his new album out or save your money."
4,A must for birding Australia,"John Bransbury's book is an invaluable help for birders to find tricky species in Australia. Sadly it is getting old (1987), and some of the information is no longer accurate. Still, do not leave home without it...."
5,Great Introduction Gift,I hope they are still making this since it's currently unavailable. It's a great little gift to present to someone unfamiliar with Caswell-Massey's classic fragrances. Box is beautiful and like their razor presentation cases. A classy little item for very little money.
1,Broke the first hour of use,"My son saved his allowance to buy two of these to use as prnaks on all of us -- his family. He bought two. They both broke within an hour -- split apart in the center. Possibly he was over-inflating them, but good grief! He is only 7. He got a good lesson in thrifty purchases."
3,These are fun.,Ordered this for my son. What a classic gag toy. He loved it until it popped right across the middle. Ended up going to the Dollar Tree and bought 3 more for $1 each. Maybe mine was just defective with thin rubber across the middle or something.
3,Cute gag in the right crowd,"We all know what woopie cushions are meant to do. My family had some fun with this with our guests during the holidays. Some people don't appreciate this particular gag, and may consider it in bad taste, so it seemed to go over better with the younger crowd."
1,Burst,Opened ... hard to blow up... burst on second try of pranking his dad... While I wasn't keen on buying a whoopee cushion to begin with he has asked for one for months and it was very disappointing to have it burst 10 minutes after opening it and only one successful try with it.
4,Price is Right!,"The whoopee cushion is not the highest quality, but it's loads of FUUUNNNN! I got this to replace one that I broke with my big butt. You cannot drop on them or they burst like a balloon. They are shipped fast and come right away with regular shipping. (I live in Washington, DC so YMMV)"
3,good but there is betters,"the product is good i dont have nothing bad, is all that i need only that is not durable and the sound is no too good, the service and the shipping was very well, thanks"
1,piece of junk,not worth spending money on. cost more to ship than price of item. didn't realize that you needed to blow item up each time it was used. small child can't do this. time in doing so eliminates fun of using. can get self inflating cushions at Wal-Mart and eliminate problem of blowing up product. very dissapointed with product.
4,Whoopee Cushion,"This item was purchased for a 6 year old's birthday gift. It was a real ""gas"". We all had a great time until the birthday boy flopped down on it to ""make a big one"" and it split. Dad came to the rescue and duct taped it so the fun could continue. It was fair priced and arrived promptly. Great fun."
4,Coax Seal protects all types of cable from moisture and corrosion (Electronics),Use it to seal up any kind of coax connection you might be installing. Works very well and it is used by all of the professional installers. Quick tip..Put some good quality electrical tape around your connection first to aid in removing the Coax Seal if you need to take the connection apart in the future.
4,Great!,"His best in years! I got a copy at a concert in Defiance, Ohio. No filler songs. All good stuff. I only wish it was longer."
1,not as represented,"If you are interested in the ship itself, don't buy this book as it is not about the ship at all it is only about the researchers and other people such as museum people. Not a single word about any of the pertinent information on the ships history, or it stranding or ship logs or anything at all. On top of that it is only 42 pages of uninteresting information and I paid $38. for this useless book, and when I contacted the seller, I was informed that I could not send back and get a full refund, only a partial refund that was unspecified. So I elected to donate it to a thrift store rather than give back the book and let the seller keep part of the money. Not happy at all with this transaction, to say the least. I could have used that $38 for some other book of more use. It was WAY overpriced."
5,Good Lightly Psychedelic Pop,"This CD is filled with plenty of good songs. ""Maker"", which takes a page from George Harrison's Indian songs, is a great track. The title tracks, ""Dear Eloise"" and ""King Midas.."" are also good psychedelia-light songs using slight effects and manipulations. ""Pegasus"" is a rather embarassing track filled with corny whimsy and horse sound-effects. The cd's best track is the druggy ""Try It"", with its trippy lyrics and backwards tape loops. Followed by ""elevated observations"", another great song with hallucinagenic references. Next, is the more straightfowardly pop, but still good, ""Step Inside"". Another favorite is ""Do the Best You Can"", with tinges of country. Its pretty obvious that the Hollies were just trying to keep up with the times by adding psychedelic touches to these pop songs, however they do it with class (except for Pegasus) and it makes for a good listen. You'd do no wrong by picking this one up."
5,Real gem of the psychedelic era,One of the best albums of the psychedelic era. A real diamond full of kaleidoscopic lights and fresh breezes of patchulie. A must for conoisseurs and lovers of the best kind of music. Expressionism full of warm colour tones. The triad Clarke-Hicks-Nash by definition.
5,sweet grass preserver,"handy, easy to open, fit nicely into my folios, albums, etc. feel very comfortable about storing my art, and paper."
5,The Thirteenth Floor was one of the Greatest scores ever.,"Well Centropolis Entertainment has done it again with their movie scores. He might not be a David Arnold, Jerry Goldsmith or even a John Williams, but Harold Klosler delivered an execlent score for ""The Thirteenth Floor"", and I'm not kidding, this guy is good. While David Arnold is too busy doing the ""James Bond"" scores, Roland Emmerich(Executive Producer)always gives young talent a chance (however old he is). If you enjoy a simple expressive score, this is what I recommend to you. My personal favourites were ""Downtown 1937"" and ""Jane's Theme"".If you are thinking fo buying this, I say go for it, just listen to the samples on this page. Paul Raymondo Hemsley."
3,"Attractive Feeder, good price","We've used Artline feeders for years and years. They're attractive, relatively inexpensive, and our birds have always loved them. But, they aren't a snap to clean so be sure you're willing to put forth a little extra effort to clean and refill at least 2x per week."
3,very technical,"I have made 2 of Karen Combs patterns and while they turned out well, I would have hated to have tried them as an inexperienced quilter. Her directions are not that easy to follow and require much rereading. The book is very technical. She does wonderful designs but really needs to have the pattern instructions written by someone else and it is not her forte."
2,Not for the novice!,"I was very disappointed. Book is VERY technical without much background. I think you need a very strong background and experience in drafting your own patterns. No real practical advice. I need something that will take me to the very beginning and bring me forward, not start me at the finish line."
5,He can sing to me all day an night,"I love all the songs on the album, I love his voice, an he is not bad to look at AT ALL. Eamon can sing any of those songs to me all day an night. I hope he stays around for awhile....to listen to....an to look at. ;)"
4,a mix between jazz and rap ez for the soul,great cd mellow and ez to listen to worth the money get it will u can
1,THIS CD SUCKS (0 STARS),"THIS CD SUCKS. IT SUCKS. EAMON SHOULD TRY TO RAP IF HE WANTS TO CUSS SO MUCH. I USED TO BE FINE WITH ALL OF THE CUSSING IN MUSIC, BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT I'VE ONLY HEARD CUSSING IN RAP. THIS GUY IS TRYIN TO BE THE EMINEM OF R&B, BUT IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. DO NOT BUY THIS CD. HE'S A WASTE OF TALENT."
1,Are You Kidding,"This has To Be The Worst Of The Worst, If This Is What Staten Island Has To Offer. I'M GLAD I DON'T LIVE THERE.A Cross Between Eminem And Vanilla Ice Just Just Don't Cut It.This Copy Is Gonna End Up In The Arthur Kill Landfill Where Even The Seagulls Won't Crap On It."
1,NO NO NO!,"This has to be thee worst CD of 2004! What the heck was I thinkig. I love F*ck it, I Don't Want You Back! But, this CD is SO BAD, I could never even recommend it to ANYONE... Steer Clear of this LAME CD. It is Not even remotely Talented to say the least.All I can say is when you watch MTV or VH1 and the show is Where are they now or 1 hit wonders...You will see Eamon.This was my worst purchase of 2004 HANDS DOWN... DON'T DO IT!Not even worthy of the 1 star. If it was just the single or Maxi for the one song maybe, but this album is B O M B!"
1,Eamon: A five letter word for holy crap that was horrible.,"(to the beat of I dont want you back):I bought this cd, thinkin that it was tight,on the top charts he was no where in sight,when i heard his lyrics, his dome i wished cracked,so F*** this cd, you can have it back.Beats = LameLyrics = Cheesaaay#1 Question = Does Mike Dee knows he sucks or what?Reality = I would have given this a negative star but i couldnt find it.Save your money fools, its so bad youll bring out the MC Hammer Cd."
1,I had to a write a Review,The single F*** It (I Don't Want You Back) was a hit in my high school and all the girls and especially my ex-girlfriend used to like it for some reason I never figured out. Anyways they rewrote the lyrics a bit and made it even funnier then the original. Anyways Eamon can't sing or whatever you wanna call it that he does and his voice is one of the most annoying ever period. Don't buy the album just download the single and that will be good enough.
2,Eamon... totally overrated,"After just listening to the cd preview on his website, this must be one of the most commercial cds to come out in a while. Half of the tracks involve getting/giving head, f**king hoes or hating them, and the other half is purely aimed to get radioplay and appeal to mainstream. Some tracks sounds alrite, but for the most part, this album was somewhat of a letdown for how much popularity his single is getting"
1,Um...didn't listen to the whole CD.,"Reminscent of Justin on helium, this Staten Island native warbles his way through cheesy, expletive filled lyrics. Attempts to become the Eminem of R&B have failed here - I was unmoved by whatever portrayals of heartbreak and love this boy tried to conjure up, or his writing team, whoever wrote these uncreative songs. Stay away from this one and burn the single if you wish. Want a real song about heartbreak and pain? Try ""I Don't Wanna Know,"" by Mario Winans. Bad Boy Records has got something going for 'em there!"
3,A Good Debut,"Regardless of how you feel about overused profanity, this CD is a strong debut for a young artist. At such a young age, it is common for artists to use shock value to be heard, but past that, Eamon has a very unique style that incorporates urban and doo-wop styles. Occasionally it dips into boy-band renderings, but he's young, give him a break. I love his sound, and I will continue to buy his albums and support his career. And if the lyrics are too explicit for you- buy the clean version, the music is still worth it."
3,Its aaight,"This cd is easy to get into and just do stuff around the house, but if you actually sit down all of the songs sound kindof alike. I like some of the songs but I don't really think he will make it past his first album. But I could be wrong, I think all he needs is another hit, and this time with a known artist."
1,WARNING! Do Not Buy This,"Who actually sat down with this kid and told him he could sing? People get dissed every year on American Idol to stop fools like this from making CD's to the public. This guy was probably an American Idol reject someone thought the female audience would embrace due to his look.Homeboy lacks vocal skills, plan and simple! The hooks on this album are annoying and hurt the ears. I'm glad a friend, who wasted their money, let me listen to his copy of this horrible mess. I did not even what to burn this crap for the simple fact I will never listen to it again! This guy has the looks but no voice. Forget him, I Don't Want His Wack CD Back in my stereo!!!!Once again... Do not buy, download, beg, borrow, steal or waste ur time on this product!"
1,Zero star material!,"I don't even know where to start. First of all Eamon has the most irritating voice ever (like Britney Spears). He sounds retarded on 'love them ho's'. 'F*** it (i don't want u back)' was so annoying. Eamon thinks he's all that but he cannot sing. Eamon's music is not Rn'B, it should fall under the category of TRASH. Frankee's album is great though, buy it."
2,THE MOST EXPLICIT R&B CD EVER,"I BOUGHT THIS CD THE DAY IT WAS RELEASED BECAUSE I REALLY LIKED THE NEW SINGLE, DONT WANT YOU BACK. COME TO FIND OUT, THAT IS THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM. THIS GUY TALKS ABOUT HIS BODY PARTS MORE THAN EMINEM. I LOVE R&B AND RAP,BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER THIS ALBUM TO BE. HE DEFINITLY HAS SOME BUILT UP EMOTIONS. HEY EAMON! CAN I SUGGEST ANGER MANAGEMENT!!?? AND CAN I GET MY 13.00 DOLLARS BACK FOR THE PURCHASE?? I'LL JUST BURN THE SINGLE OFF THE INTERNET."
1,Garbage,"This album is pure garbage. No lyrical/vocal skills, just a bunch of trashy lyrics designed to cling to high school teenagers with the hopes of making a quick buck. This guy should be stoned and burned alive for this pitiful attempt to enter the Hip-Hop and/or R&B music industry. Stick to punk rock."
1,I Don't Want You Back by Eamon,"Never did the phrase 'one hit wonder' apply more than it does here. ""F**k It (I Don't Want You Back)"", is this album's only shining star. The rest of the tracks are just copy cats, with painfully poor lyrics & absolutely no fluent melodies or rhythms at all. The truly sad part is, Eamon shouldn't have to end his career after just one song. He actually has a nice singing voice, but the problem is he has way to much artistic freedom, which unfortunatley has been the downfall of many talented new artists. Had Jive only taken more interest & hired gifted producers & song writers, things might have been different. Say hello to 2004's Lumidee, but also remember to say a quick goodbye very shortly thereafter."
1,I was going to give this five stars...,"...but then I realized that it wasn't a comedy CD. This album is a joke, and so is Eamon, his ""music,"" and his ex-girlfriend Frankee. They really need to grow up. They really need to mature.Wu TangAugileraFrankeeEamonAll of them hail from Staten Island. What's next? How ashamed I am."
1,Just goes to show...,"Any record company with a decent producer and some nerd working on fruityloops can make some little talentless punk into a star. Anyone who gave this CD above 2 stars doesnt deserve to listen to music, this is pure garbage."
1,Not Again,"It's so nice that so many little white guys are getting their rich parents to front them money for studio time these days. This albumn should not even be listed in the hip hop section. The single gets nation wide airplay on all corp. owned stations, which just means that station are still accepting way too much illegal inncentive money to play crappy music, regardless of what real people think. People hear these songs so much, they think they like them just cause they learn all the words. The FCC says they are getting hard on radio and tv, but they let crap like this still air. Skip this and buy a real albumn by someone who desrves to go platnum."
1,who does this guy think he is!,"this is absolutely the worst album ever produced by anyone period. Eamon sucks. He thinks he is all that by talking so much crap. This guy is thinks he is all gangsta but i think my 8 yr. old brother could beat this dude. He can't back up anything. Eminem is a true thug and can back up his talk. This guy sings and acts like a big softy. He has no balls. The song ""i don't want you back"" is so horrible that anyone who likes it should seriously jump off of a cliff."
1,Whatever-thats all I have to say,"Ok...I haven't bought the CD, but from hearing the other reviews from people who have has made me happy that I havent wasted money on the CD. I have only heard ""I dont want you back"" and I liked it, but then I heard the come back song if you want to call it that. Me and my friends were driving back to town from a school musical and one of them turned up the radio and asked if I had ever heard this song before. I'm like isn't it ""I dont want you back"" by Eamon and they said no and I am like are you sure cuz it sounds like it. It was some girl (probably the same girl the song was directed to in Eamon's song) singing back to Eamon in her own version, in her own song! I thought it was pretty funny but I don't know who sings it and I don't know what it's called. So if anyone knows please tell me!! Thanks..and I know..this was probably a dumb review but hey, it's late, I have no life, and I'm really bored! :P"
1,Flash in the pan man.,"I hope this guy blows on by and there's no doubt in my mind that he will. Don't Want You Back stinks and is extremely irritating. What an insulting song. As for the rest of the stuff on here, let's just say this CD will make a great frisbee or coaster. Not worth a penny. Don't buy this. This guy doesn't even deserve to have one minute of fame in my book."
1,the worst crap ever,"i don't even want to give this thing any stars. the cd is horrible. it isn't funny, it's stupid. this boy has a complex that needs to be dealt with before he pollutes the world with more of his ""music."""
5,I'd Rather F**K With You Too Eamon,"This is one of those album that you just say, 'Wow' about. He can pull off the high voice and then sing in a deeper voice. 'I'd Rather F**k With You' is an awesome remake of Bootsy Collin's 'I'd Rather Be With You'. I love this album, it's great at parties, sitting at home and cranking up REALLY loud in your car."
4,different (and I like it!!),"He definitely has a different style and voice, but I find that a good thing!! Its nice hearing a change every now and then. And I really hope he comes out with another CD sometime soon. ""I dont want you back"" is an excellent song, its about time a guy let out his anger about being screwed over in such a way as Eamon has done here.My only gripe is that after listening to the CD through several times, some of the songs start to sound similar. But its a pretty good overall CD."
1,This is PURE CRAP,"I am sad to say that music artist have fallen to an all time low. I was excited to see a fresh new face and when I listend to this CD, I threw the thing in the trash. It wasn't even worth my gas to go back and return it. It is easy to see that this guy has some SERIOUS issues. I am so looking forward to the day when music reverts back to MUSIC. The stuff now days is full of Bitc* dis and Hoe dat and folks wonder why teenage pregancy is so high. Males, grow up and be men and stop disrespecting women. Females, grow up and be women and stop asking is this low enough when told to 'Get Low' or Shake it Like a Saltshaker. Who ever produced this CD needs to be put out of the industry. This is definitely a slap in the face to music artist that are trying to do right by the fans. The scary part is that there are people that actually like this stupid CD!"
2,Who signed this moron?,"First, Eamon can't sing. His voice is so obnoxious. I'm not sure who gave him a record deal, but they should be shot. ""F**K it"" is a terrible song that gets more annoying everytime you hear it. I'm dreading his next single. All the songs on the album are the same. Eamon cursing every 2 seconds on a crappy beat. The guy curses like he thinks it's cool & it will sell more records, but i have news for you: THIS CD WILL TANK, & PEOPLE WILL SAY F*** YOU EAMON, WE DON'T WANT YOU BACK."
1,Terrible,"This is just bad. I guess if you're a fan of this typical kind of nasty type rap which is pretty much universal, you may like this. There's no point to any songs, but that's what it's about right? cash, money, hoes..and life in the ghetto. I'd rather listen to Eminem who talks about whats real, what's funny, and at the same time sad. Eminem fans, there's nothing here. And this guy is a wannabe."
4,Eamon,"I think Eamon's cd ""I don't want you back"" is an excellent CD. I was personally happy to finally hear a guy come out with a song to a female like all the female songs that are singing to guys. The CD is basically saying the same thing. My favorite song is ""Something Strange"". If you like break up songs or you've been wronged in a relationship you should like this CD and Eamon is pretty Hot LOL.Other then that all I can say is check it out and see for yourself."
2,KEEPING IT REAL!,"What a trip, he's gots da flo'! A number one rapper with a supa-fly ego. He'll show all them black rappers what it means to be white. NEXT ICE, COMING THROUGH-- ands we's talkin' VANILLA!S'cool, thinkin' EAST COAST. Can't believe da sucka from South Afrika. Total flava. Sing it out dude. I still can't believe he does opera on the last track. Whassup wit dat?!"
1,"If I could, I'd rate it ZERO.","I, like everyone else in America, have ""Don't Want You Back"" stuck in my head. Unfortunately, it's one of those songs I wish I could forget because I think the song is terrible. Out of curiosity, I listened to sound clips of the rest of the album and could not find one single song that was not full of cursing or talk of his crotch. Even if this kid had any vocal talent, it still wouldn't help this album. He has one of those voices that sounds like he sucked on too many helium ballons as a child. This is easily one of the worst albums of the year. If you see it in a store, DO NOT touch this album. It's not worth your time. Heck, it's not even worth burning a copy from someone else. If I could rate this cd at zero stars, I would."
1,in the words of eamon - a f***ing s**t album,"ALL THE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM ARE ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL (APART FROM MAYBE ""CONTROVERSY""). I would recommend this to big thugs and tough people who think they're so cool just 'cause they can swear.WELL I GOTTA TELL YA SOMETHING - EAMON, YOU ARE AN INSULT TO MUSIC! why did anyone sign him? Do not buy this album unless you're deaf!!!"
1,......,"They call this music? He has a nice voice, but unfortunately he has chosen to employ it in a rather horrible way."
4,Crap Talkers,I think that the song that Eamon wrote were great in this cd. He says all of that because thats the way he feels for his girlfriend cheating on him I think it's a great cd. For all of those people who say its rude and not a cool cd yall just don't probably know how it is to feel to be cheated on. I did and afterwords when me and my boyfriend broke up I gave him that song called &quot;I Don't Want You Back(F*** It)&quot; and I didn't even care how he felt. Eamon has a great cd.I don't care what other people say but you have to hear it if you haven't and get your own review of the cd.
1,"Wow, that was horrible!","First of all, this guy cannot sing. He sounds like he is yelling into the mic on Don't Want You Back, and the rest of his crooning is just as bad. He tries to act like a thug and comes off as a punk. For the last time, R&B cats cannot be thugs. The whole album sounds like teenie bopper crap, made for a truly shallow generation. It really saddens me because I am part of this generation that puts out this crap. If you hated this and want some real edgy R&B, check out Cody Chestnutt. His album, ""The Headphone Masterpiece"", is what Eamon was trying to do here. I must say, Eamon's album has the worst production, singing, and most of all, writing. I mean c'mon ""I even said you were my great one."" WTF is that? He stole that from A Bronx Tale! Okay, I'm rambling, point is, do not buy this album."
1,yuck!,I haven't even bought this cd and I wouldn't buy it his voice is terrible!!! I wish he would have tried out for american idol and then Simon could tell him how terrible he is and then maybe he could write songs about that he sounds like a whiny old *itch!!!
3,This is pretty good. Everyone else needs to shut up,The Cd is pretty tight man. I mean my man has got some issues but so does everyone else in this world. His girl played him so he gets out his frustration by telling the whole world how he don't want that b**** back. Great album shows alot of emotions.
1,WTF!! Why are people giving this higher than one star?,"This is Joseph's oldest DAUGHTER.This guys stinks. BIG TIME. And if you looked up the definition of ""Talent"", you definitely WOULD NOT find Eamon there. Look up the definition of ""Awful"". He'll be there.He can't sing. And he degrades woman. BAD combination.Don't support this sorry excuse for an artist."
1,Irritating,I compare this album to having chappped @ss from taking to many dumps.Eamon sucks canal water through a straw.This is by far the worst piece of garbage I have ever heard in my entire life.I recommend pouring gasoline on yourself and lighting yourself on fire rather than listening to this crap.
1,What is this???,"Wow, what is this world coming to!! This guy needs a shink. So what if a girl screwed him, it happens all the time. He should get over it and not tell me about it because, to tell the truth, I really do not care. And calling girls hoes, sorry, it doesn't cut it. He should look at himself first because, like it or not, men are bigger hoes then women and that is a fact. It's real life, get over it. I don't hate, I look at real facts and tell it like it is. And wheater you like it or not, rap sounds the same all around, it's not a joke. All they rap about is how women screwed them or how women should be treated. If that is not an insult, I don't know what is. They should rap about something that is important in life not about the same sh*t over and over again. It's boring and not realistic. Maybe a woman rapper should rap in the same way about guys."
1,"Please stop ""singing""...","How did this fool get a record deal??? This opportunist takes the worst elements of R&B and pop rap and makes them even worse. Add to this his perpetual whining, pointless cursing, and below-average vocal skills, and you get an album that will fade into anonymity after the initial shock value wears off. Don't support this garbage."
1,Haha this kid is a joke.,"I hated the stupid single since it came out. For some ungodly reason some people liked and felt it was a good song.. For these people I feel very bad for. This kid sounds like.....well a kid. Cannot sing for his life. Some idiot said...hmm lets grab some random jerk-ass and lets make him famous by make him read some bad song. Thats what he is doing is reading ... definetly not singing. I was watching some award show or something and he gave some performance...hahaha it was so funny..they needed some back up lady singer and some rapper making random noises to help eamon with his little song .. sounded like such garbage... He doesn't even sing.. His voice sounds like the punk west islip kids who wear upside down sunvisors and start fights with everyone they see. Your not cool, your music sucks. I hope you are going to college kid... I do not sense another ""sucker"" smash hit."
1,kid is a real HERB !!!,"i got a promo of this kids cd, and it is pure garbage. another clown from staten island... he probably grew up in a rich family who knew someone in the record industry, or just sucked alot of sausage to get this horrible cd released!!! the s.i. dump would be to good for this cd ... LIGHT IT ON FIRE AND DO A DANCE AROUND IT, or just skim the ocean with it to have more fun than poppin it into your disc player ... i use it as a coffee table coaster! .... next herb from s.i. to come out with anymore of this untalented crap is gettin slapped!!!!!"
1,Hey buddy,"THE GUY THAT JUST WROTE THAT, STATEN ISLAND IS NOT LIKE EAMON, EAMON IS A LOSER...I LIVE IN STATEN ISLAND DONT SAY SH** ABOUT IT YOU LOSERRRRR"
1,the worst singer i have ever heard,eamon is the worst singer. people from american idol that sucked were better. He thnks hes cool to swear alot in slow songs. i would rate this cd 0 out of 5 if you could
2,This book is very light in technical substance.,"Given its relatively high price (when compared to other more substantive references), I was most disappointed with this book. I found this book to be scarcely more than marketing white-papers on the subjects of JDBC and RMI. The source code examples are incomplete. Going to the Que website to retrieve complete source-code for the samples also included only snippets of code -- not whole working sample applications. As an ""introduction to enterprise java"", I think this book does a fine job. As a ""most complete reference"", however, it was very disappointing."
4,Good!,I have had this item installed between my spigot and hose caddy for a while now and I have not had any leaks and only minimal dripping at connections. Getting the job done for well over a year as far as I can tell!
1,Bad toe ring,"I was super excited for this toe ring, but when I got it, it was way thicker then I thought and didn't fit comfortable on my toe and then it broke in half :("
3,2nd and loaded with vocals,Wallenstein were part of the German seventies Krautrock/Cosmic Music lable/scene. They often appeared solo on MUCH GREATER releases such as The Cosmic Jokers (track them all down). Here on their second lp they let the bass guitarist sing all these odd off key tunes along with their usual drugged out symphonic rock. Strangely I dont mind this album (of the four it has the most vocals) the songs are nieve and odd ball enough to be interesting. But I can see anyone expecting good vocals and pure space rock just ripping this out of their CD player and throwing it across the room.
3,Expected too much,"This product is ok, but did not give the tire shine I expected. Not like the local car wash product I was hoping for."
4,Works great!,I needed this product for my last month of pregnancy. It saved me from having to buy new bras.
5,lives up to expectations,"The bra extender is exactly as advertised. Since I am pregnant and my regular bras were running too tight, I purchased these extenders and they are easy to put on and hook and unhook. No problems and it is universal for right or left handed people who hook their bras. Just make sure you know how many columns your current bra has because the company doesn't sell assorted sizes like 2,3,or 4 rows per pack."
3,It does the job...no great though,"The bra extender shipped on time and arrived as planned. However the hooks on the band dont quite match the hooks on my bra, they are narrower so my bra bunches slightly. When ordering, you order according to the number of hooks (2,3 or 4) but that doesnt mean they automatically match up perfectly.Either way, thats a relatively minor annoyance. I'm pregnant and the fact is that the hooks fit okay (you have to force it) but they fit okay...and I do think it helps bra's last a bit longer before you have to move into maternity bras."
1,do not buy this garbage,"The picture and the name ""Euro"" makes it seem like it's good quality but it's quite the opposite. The board is flimsy and thin, so thin that it feels like you'll cut yourself. The light is flimsy and doesn't adjust well, the pencil case almost broke trying to get it open and what I am most disappointed in is the bottom cushion. The ""cushion"" is this little flimsy detachable pillow is not even full so it does not sit comfortable on the lap or stabilizes enough for my laptop. I opened the box and was very disappointed and as I inspected it I noticed the desk was coming apart at the bottom. I thought I was getting a deal with the price but it wasn't even worth it. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
3,Beauty is indeed skin deep,"I received this item as a Christmas gift. The desktop has a very nice finish on the wood and the small compartments in the upper corners are really handy. They are each big enough to hold a couple of pens/pencils. The lids of the compartments are sturdy and secure with the magnet closure.Now for the negatives. The cushion underneath the desktop is basically a small tufted throw pillow. It's not the most stable base, but it's okay. It's secured to the desktop with Velcro. When I unpacked the item, one of the Velcro strips attached to the underside of the desktop was coming loose. They are glued and stapled...and not very well.All in all, this item is functional and attractive. But if the quality doesn't improve, I wouldn't pay $40 for it myself."
1,Not what it appears to be,"A big seller at Christmas as bestbuy was routinely sold out of this item leading up to and even after Christmas, but it's a deceiving product. What looks like a nice solid laptop desk, is actually a very cheap laminate fiberboard material.Totally over-priced and not at all what it purports to be. The bamboo and mahogany versions were big sellers, but it's a rip-off. At about $5.00, this might be worth it. At $40-$50, it's a high priced piece of cardboard, with an attractive, but cheap glued on laminate.Don't bother with this one."
3,Good Lapdesk,"Bought this lap desk some time ago and think it's above average. The cushion is below average and not very comfortable. I also don't care for the cubby holes on the top as they stick come down too far. I do like the wood, it's lightweight, and a decent size for my 17"" laptop.Overall, I would look to buy this product again if I could find it without the cubby holes."
1,Thank you for the reviews - not gonna buy it.,There is enough consistent data on this product that steered me away from buying it. Thank you for your reviews. Sorry to hear about your bad experiences.
5,Soldier in the Sand.,"Great movie. Not only does it teach couples the basics, but it gives a lot of good ideas on how to work it into thier normal routines instead of all or nothing. This movie is also great to watch over and over again with your partner. This movie gets two thumbs up from both myself, and my wife."
1,Taste like cardboard and has the texture of stones,"My 9 month old is a big fan of Gerber's Graduates Lil' Crunchies in Mild Cheddar flavor. There are days when she's so picky about food but she never refuses the Lil' Cheddar Crunchies. Hoping to expand her tastebuds, I decided to try these Cheesy Carrot Wagon Wheels when we saw them on sale at a local store. THANK GOODNESS I DIDN'T ORDER THESE IN BULK THROUGH AMAZON! First of all, the texture is vastly different from the Lil' Crunchies. These wheels are incredibly hard and do not melt in your mouth like the Lil' Crunchies. There is also no taste of cheese at all. In fact, it's much like biting on cardboard! I can't believe these Wagon Wheels are so vastly different from the Lil' Crunchies. I guess we'll have to feed this can to the pigeons at the park!"
2,Works Great... for about 6 months,"I have had two of these antennas and the same thing happened with both. This antenna works greats and will pick up the Sirius feed with no problems - for about 6 months. After that, you will first start to experience transmission blackouts and then the antenna will eventually stop working.The problem I experienced both times was that there was a short somewhere in the wire - in other words, the antenna was working properly; it just cannot get the feed to the receiver.Wish I could direct you to a better antenna but I have had this happen with other brands. I live in PA - where there is extreme weather. I still have and use my original home antenna from two years ago. I am currently on my fourth antenna (which is starting to go bad)."
1,This Antenna is not available on the Sirius Web Site,"Don't know if it means they've dropped the product, but this antenna can't be ordered from Sirius at this time (7/2/07).Mine died after about a year with the same symptoms mentioned in other reviews. I purchased the 14105 model for my Sportster Replay and it works fine."
2,Wish I never had this!,I've been using this antenna for about 9 months and it still works just fine. I went to pull it off the car to clean it the other day and the magnet had recessed itself into the plastic cover which then came in contact with the finish of my car. It has scratched down to bare metal and I'm going to have to have it fixed. I also noticed some rust coming from inside the antenna - so I'm expecting my days of use are limited.These things should have a rubberized base.
1,CABLE VERY FRAGILE,My first cable broke and so did the second one and they can't be repaired. Be very careful as it is very fragile. It could be better protected and still work in car. Bad product design.
1,Bad Quality - Shame on you Sirius,"I'm on my 4th antenna since I bought my Stiletto 2 years ago. That's an added $80 per year added to the cost of owning Sirius radio. Make a better product, make a product the end user can repair or redo your entire business model so consumers don't feel robbed and eventually abandon your product for something more reliable. SHAME ON YOU SIRIUS."
1,Absolute junk,"I've gone through 2 of these in less than 2 years. I initially thought it was the wire that was going bad, but after disassembling the non-working units I found a tremendous amount of corrosion inside. No wonder they stopped working.I wouldn't buy another one of these. I'm going to look for a different brand this time around."
1,Garbage,"I'm on my second antenna within a year and it is failing too. I get an ""Acquiring Signal"" message that is interruped occasionally by the progamming we paid to hear. The antenna really is a cheap piece of garbage. I would recommend not wasting money on this worthless antenna. I'm angry with Sirius for selling me these pieces of trash and am debating whether I will renew my service."
1,Yes it is junk,My antenna lasted about 7 months and now is cutting out. An old XM radio antenna works great but it is my spare. The replacement prices are rediculus. You can get a new radio with everything for less.
1,This antenna is terrible,"I have had a Sirius Radio for about 2 and a half years. The original antenna I had from when I bought the unit lasted about 14 months with no problem, until it broke. For the last 12 months I have been purchasing these pieces of junk at $40 each from my local bestbuy. In 12 months time I have probably gone through 4 of these antennas with each one lasting about 2-3 months. I`m about ready to go purchasing my 5th antenna because the one I own is getting ready to die. Buyer beware on these. These would probably be a better deal if they where only 10-15 dollars each. But at $40 per antenna with an average life span of 3 months is just outrageous."
3,"Not serious,.. or very funny, but pretty good","This album blows honestly, the original album is unbearable, but it is also very short thankfully. I can only imagine what could have spawned it. The Groovies humorous approach to music brings to mind Dan Hicks, or even Frank Zappa for that matter. If they want to make fun of it, then why do they do it? The bonus tracks are the only thing of value on this, and they are pretty goddam good. So you have to make a decision.I recently uncovered this little gem while trying my collection, and would highly recommend it for the bonus tracks actually."
5,His best yet!,"""Couples in Trouble"" is breathtaking. By far his best and most consistent effort. All 12 of the songs are very listenable; it only takes a few trips through the cd for your ears to be hooked. But then, take a little time to really *listen* to the stories he's telling--and you will be blown away by the raw, naked, vulnerable, self-exposed lyrics. Check this one out folks, you won't be disappointed."

1,MS is Not Disney,"If you want to hear Disney, buy Disney. A lot of MS starts to run together, and I'm afraid this is an example. The kiddie set will be disappointed and will find it difficult to relate to the music they hear in their videos."
4,Solid writing w/ a great twist ending,"The Alias prequel series started out okay with mostly character development in RECRUITED, and picked up speed but didn't change much with the action-packed A SECRET LIFE. Now, as Lynn Mason's second entry into the series, she combines the best of both of those books in DISAPPEARED.It seems as if the main character, Sydney Bristow, has really grown up and is learning how to do things on her own and handle a full mission. The plot clipped along at a rapid pace but didn't leave anything to be desired, and the ending had a twist that was something I'd expect from the show's brilliant writers. Overall much better than its slightly-better-than-average-predecessors that I just read as a fan of the show. This one leaves you wanting more."
2,"After 2 Good Books, This One Falls","I am very sad to have to give this book a bad review. I loved the first two, especially the second one. But this one just wasn't interesting. It doesn't do anything with Sydney's character development. It just focuses on her first ""real"" mission, which turns out to sound like one long game of ""Clue!"" (Was it Mr. Mustard in the library with a candlestick?...) Book 2's mission in Paris was much more exciting & true to the feel of the show. In this mission mostly people are sitting around talking - ver slow, very boring! I kept waiting for something to develop, but it never did. So you can trust me when I say, go ahead and skip this one! You won't be missing anything! I will still be purchasing Book 4, in the hopes that this was just an aberration."
2,A Valiant Effort,"While the first two Alias books were fun, exciting, and action packed, this one is a drag. Sydney goes to a ""spooky"" castle to discuss the problems of a fictional European country with several organized crime figures. Sydney doesn't do much when they start being bumped off one-by-one. The story isn't very original and there isn't much action to this book. I am sorry to say it is a disappointing addition to the series."
3,Not much action. But if you like murder mysteries....,"This installment of the series is more like a myder mystery, than a high-tech action mini-novel. I found myself being very disappointed in this one until the last two chapters. It starts off like the other two books, then...like I said, if you like murder mysteries, then you may like this one. But it doesn't get Alias-like until the last two chapters. The last two chapters redeems the book, BUT not enough to rate it higher.For TEENS"
5,La Prairie Cellular Skin Conditioner 125ml/4.2oz,This is one of La Prairie's best products. Have been using it over 20yrs and it is still the best skin cream I have found without exception.Have tried many over the years in lots of price ranges from a few dollars to a few hundred and this is still the best.
1,Not helpful.,"I did not find anything useful in this book. If you are looking to start a career in the fire service, the best advice is to go to your local station and ask the firefighters. They will be happy to give advice and will know specifically what you need to do to get a job in that particular area. If you really feel the need to read this book, go to the library! If this exact book isn't available, there are sure to be other similar books to help you get started."
3,"Some excellent material, but","There is some excellent material in this book, and if you read the book and follow the examples you'll know a heckuva lot more about Photoshop color correction than you did when you started.So why not five stars?I subtracted one for the totally unacceptable number of errors in the book, a flaw mentioned by several other reviewers. This book badly needed a technical editor - if it had one, he/she should be fired.I subtracted another because although the book is very strong on working with CMYK images, for some (not all) techniques it glosses over RGB correction.I would have subtracted another half star for the poor quality of the images on the CD, were that possible."
3,Too many errata!,"The information in this book is valuable. Without the numerous editing mistakes, the book would receive five stars. But the material is frustrating to follow because I can't help wondering if the material I am studying has another typo or another mislabeled or misplaced caption. I have been unable to find a list of errata from the publisher or author. That would help significantly."
5,Great Product,"A sturdy, well-built product great for its' intended use and also for just shaving ice for kids drinks."
2,Too Little,"Picture of Product doesn't show that they are only half-pages not really very useful. Be sure you need only 1/2 an album page, 2 cd's on one side 2 cd's on the reverse side."
4,A great alternate.,My son is taking this product since 3 months. I like this product both in terms of price and ingredients.So far my experience with Amazon is excellent. I have received shipment on time and I did not see any expiry date issue.
3,Would recommend,Great for keeping dust of negatives sleeves and photos. One fault is that the 3 ring binder withing the case sometimes leaves a tiny gap when fully closed so that you don't notice until you flip through your sleeves and realize that some are falling out of that one ring. Pretty frustrating especially when you have the binder full of pages!
3,"It's all right, but could be designed better.","I have used this binder for over 2 years. The handle will break off within a month after purchase. I know 8 people who own this and none of them have the handle on it, due to breakage. Otherwise, its a fairly standard 3 ring binder that happens to have an outer edge. It really isn't much better at protecting than a regular 3 ring binder. If I run out of space and need another, I will buy a much less expensive office binder."
4,"Great case, but handle is poorly made","I bought this case initially for the cost and because it had a handle on the outside. When it came, I realized the handle was a seperate piece that fit unto the a slit on the inside of the cover. The handle held for a few weeks, then one day I picked up the workbox (with just a few negatives inside, it was not heavy) and the handle snapped. I examined the handle where it broke and realized that the part that went into the cover was very easy to tear. I then taped it with masking tape and it worked for a few more days before it broke again.If you don't need the handle, it's a great case. No other problems with it."
2,Havne't I read this before??,"Drake has fallen into the same trap as Jordan and Goodkind.... ""If I write it, they will read it."" This book achieved nothing, and we learned precious little about the chracaters that we didn't know already. And on top of all that, we've read this plot before: Everyone together; Everyone separated; Everyone triumphs; Everyone back together again for final, apocalyptic, finale."
1,I want my time back!,"What a waste of time!Each book after the first is basically the same, everyone get separated, has their adventures, solves their particular problem and then they all come back together. A few new characters have been added but very little has happened to move the story along. I am certainly glad these books were purchased used, in paperback. At least all I have lost is some time. All six books will be going to Goodwill...they should most likely go in the trash.If it were only possible to give -stars..."
2,Boiler Plate,"I was hoping that the series would get better. The author doesn't develop his characters very well which to me makes for dull stories. There tends to be plenty of action, but the action is predictable. The characters end up split up by forces beyond their control. They each concur the evil forces by the powers they possess. And they reunite in the end. Each character stays within the limited characterist the author gives them and never steps out of those rolls. There seems to be no growth in the characters. I haven't finished this book because it fails to take me anywhere new."
4,master of the cauldron,drake has continued his opera of the lord of the isles. i am again happy with the way he moves from player to player.
5,Essential perspectives of living with ADHD,As a adult recently diagnosed with ADHD-PI I found allot of useful information in this book. Many of the cases and issues discussed speak directly to me and provides valuable lessons for coming to terms with my condition. Concretely I have used the advice to become better at setting boundaries and communicating me needs and become better at seeking out work that plays to my strengths. Highly recommended.
4,It is an oil filter for a boat,"IT's a boat oil filter, nothing exciting. The delivery cost was more than the cost of the filter itself, but worth it because purchasinig it at a marina is much more expensive"
4,You have to love these two champions!,"I started skiing in the eighties, read the Mahre book and it really helped me understand and improve. When I took up skiing again two years ago, I thought this video would be an easy way to pick up some skills again. I didn't realize how much times, and skiing changed. The video is still helpful with certain concepts, but generally I would say it easier to just buy a group lesson."
5,Just Relax!,I have listened to this in my car and while I am cuddled up with a good book at home. It is a great mixture of musicians. It helps clear your mind and really relax. It is a favorite of mine.
4,Really Good CD,"Big Bun did a good job on this cd! The best songs are 1,2,4,8,9, and 10. Go buy this cd, it is really awesome! We miss you Pun!"
3,Cute but confusing,"I love Haba games, but I am not a fan of this particular one. The game is very confusing (my husband refuses to play it because he can never keep up with what is supposed to happen!). My 3-yr-old kept wanting to play because she likes the cute suitcases, but she would give up soon after starting because the rules are too complicated for her to follow (and she is highly intelligent for her age). And for those of us who can keep up with the rules, the game is too young for and therefore boring. The game just sits on the shelf and no longer gets played with at all. I would not purchase again and do not recommend to others."
4,Thrilling Book!,I thought this book was very exciting and filled with the ups and downs of everyday life. I mostly liked the grandfather and his mysterious secrets and how he conducted himself during the war. He was a brave man who knew not to give up when confronted with the impossible. This is a good tale of a World War II hero. The data is also very accurate. Recommended.
3,Warning,"NOT GLUTEN FREE. I will update this when Amazon finally changes the description, it blows my mind that something so important wasn't fixed in a more timely manner."
2,Mickey Mats,"Mats arrived today. Nice looking and good fit. However, a manufacturer's defect caused half of the pointy 'nubs' on the bottom to be missing. Those that are there are fine, but they gradually fade down until there's nothing but a smooth surface and the mats slip. Both mats had the same problem but in different areas. They were intended as a gift, but now they'll have to be exchanged. This is NOT Amazon's fault, but purchaser's may wish to keep this in mind.UPDATE: Replacement mats arrived today less than a week after requested. Unfortunately, they have the same problem but in different areas. Definitely a quality control problem on the part of the manufacturer. Amazon's exchange program is excellent. No hassles and fast service. I'll continue to shop at Amazon."
4,Floor mat review,Very nice floor mats. Heavy duty. Should last for many years. The price was better than anything I could find where I live. They are a little more narrow than regular floor mats but they still look good. I bought a second set to give as a gift.
4,I only like one song...,"I am feelin' the song ""Shake dem Haters"" because that's my theme song for real. I can't believe that I'm the first person to review this CD, but it's not surprising. Quint Black's not all that known. Well, to put it in a nutshell, I need to hear some more of the CD...."
4,Dry Wit,"Dr. Phipps leads the reader down a fun path looking at the wit and wisdom of Jesus. As a student of Dr. Phipps over 20 years ago, I was and still very interested in his scholarship of Jesus and his life. Dr.Phipps is not shy about asking the hard questions of Jesus, and the hard questions of our own thoughts of Jesus. You are asked to view Jesus as a real person who like you and I, laugh, cry and times have fun. Enjoy the read."
3,Logos,"The author seems more interested in his own life story and personal flights of fancy than I expected when choosing to buy this small book. Not a bad book, but not great either. I do agree with Professor Stavans on the importance of Dr. Johnson, and urge everyone to read James Boswell's great biography of the London drudge.One sidelight: Anyone wondering about the current U.S. problem with illegal immigration might benefit from reading chapter nine of Dictionary Days."
5,Lawn Boy 10367 6.5 hp lawn mower,This is a great lawn mower. It starts easily. It will go as fast as you can walk.
3,Mulching performance,"Lawn-Boy has recently redesigned their push mowers, presumably, to merge with the Toro product line. The victims of this transformation are, among other things, the non-circular steel deck. During mulching the grass cuttings tend to accumulate in converging clearance between the rotating blade and the non-circular housing, and ultimmately stops. The mower then has to be turned on the side and the underside manually cleaned. When turned back over to continue mowing, the motor does not always restart. This is a mmajor nuisance!"
1,Read All Reviews For This Style of Deck,"Before purchasing this style of lawnmower which is made by Lawnboy/Toro, I would suggest looking at all products that have the off set wheel deck... or staggered deck and read all reviews.If you take the time to do this, you will see that this is a very poor design!Please keep in mind that it does not matter if the machine is self propelled or push type. It also does not matter if it is a two stroke or a four stroke engine.The problem I have experienced is the poor quality and very poorly designed deck.Before buying this type of lawnmower, ask your self, ""If it is so great... why do they offer a two year warranty?"" My advice would be if a tool or machine has a two year warranty, do not buy it!Also, please keep in mind that the Toro Company is based in Bloomington, MN! I would be very skeptical of any positive review from that part of the country."
1,I'd love it if I had it,"I ordered this forever ago and I've still not recieved it... The vendor has not made any effort to let me know it was coming, and I am very upset with how it's been handled."
4,great sounding strings,I use these strings on my gig guitar because the are light enough I can play a couple hours without shredding my fingers but they are big enough to give it a nice warm sound
1,Defective string,As I began to tune these babies up the first string broke once it had a tiny bit of tension in it. No spares so now I have to order another set. I know this happens once in a while. Too bad.. sticking to Elixirs.
4,Pretty nice,"When I read the reviews, I was completely convinced to buy these. After going through elixers, exps, and various martin strings, I was getting desperate for a string that had deep bass and non-tinny high notes. I was actually getting frustrated. Then I remembered seeing these strings at Guitar Center. They were cheap, unlike the other strings I had bought, so I decided to take a risk. After restringing my guitar, I was amazed. The strings sounded bright and clear, the exact thing I was looking for. The strings sound extremely clear, yet rich, and I am pretty satisfied.Just one complaint: The strings are advertised as medium light, which is 12-54. However, when I put the strings on, they felt much thinner. For example, the high e-string felt like it was 10 if not thinner. Maybe it's just me? I don't really know; it just felt strange to me.Great string overall though!"
5,A must for large dogs,I have a bullmastiff and she was very difficult to walk because she pulled so much. I tried the Gentle Leader and it worked wonders from the very first walk. She learned very quickly not to pull and our walks are so much more enjoyable. I am in complete control. Now I have a great dane puppy and I'm getting one for her also.
3,Not the best fit for rough coat collie,"At the urging of my vet and several friends I bought the gentle leader (medium) for my 65 lb, 8 month old Collie. He accepted the nose band very quickly but adjusting it so that it wasn't too restrictive around his nose allowed it slide up into his eyes. He responded very well to the headcollar and stopped pulling immediately but it just didn't fit well over his large wedge-shaped nose, which is why I rated it a 3. I bought a Halti (size 2) one week later and it fit his head much better. Both head collars worked really well to stop the pulling but the Halti had a better fit for a Collie-shaped face. I will save the gentle leader to use with the Lab puppy I am getting in a few weeks."
3,3 out of 4 Paws,"First Impression: When Dad returned the Halti Collar he got me the Gentle Leader. It works much better than the Halti. The strap that gets tightened under my jaw prevents the harness from riding up and pressing on my eyelid. I still do not really like the Gentle Leader because it prevents me from looking at other dogs, but I wear it in exchange for being taken on walks. The Gentle Leader comes in a large enough size to fit my giant Rottweiler head.Conclusion: If your parents complain that you pull too much on your walks, you may want to tell them about the Gentle Leader. I like a prong collar more, but Dad says I behave more with the Gentle Leader."
5,Lubricant treats skin good,"The wet is easy to clean up, and it is water soluble so it doesn't leave marks. It feels like water but it hydrates the area and keeps me from having friction problems. My husband bought it originally for use with toys, but it also works great for anal intercourse."
1,Not a gel,"First of all this stuff burns like you would not believe . They say that it's hypoallergenic, but it is not. Then it has a nerve to not even be a gel. It's some kind of watery junk. No thanks I will stick to Astroglide."
4,Just what he needed,This is just what my son needed. He is a Sophomore in college and was required to get this book. I found it and it was a great price! I will look for other books through your organization.
5,Essentials of American Government 2008 Edition,Really happy with my order. I ordered on Wed and got the book on Sat. This is really good since my class starts on Mon. Thanks for the fast turnaround.
2,10 year battery died within 6 months.,I purchased this watch because it had a 10 year battery. A replacement battery costs more to install than this new watch. I liked the watch very much..until the battery died after 6 months..purchased it in end of June or July.
4,very nice watch,"The HDD600-1AV is a good-looking watch with a comfortablearmband. The 10 year battery is a real plus, and, aswith most digital watches it has stopwatch, dual time,alarm, date, and day of the week. The only thing Idon't like is the date and day-of-week fields at thetop of the watch window are too small - if youreyesight isn't what it used to be then you can'tread it without glasses."
5,Another great album!!!!,"Michael Hill said in a recent interview that he really likes to try another kind of works and it's really what he have done at this new album by an independent label.He left Alligator Records but don't forgot that roots and friends,and that old style to play,his urban blues with great social influences.What is curious is the fact that Hill seems to be affective with kids,and the art cover of this cd reveals this side of his personality!!The participation of Living Colour's Vernon Reid on ""41 Shots"" must be remembered.A great album of this really true bluesman searching for new bluesways!!!I enjoyed so much!!!"
4,Really good storytelling!,"This book is thoroughly enjoyable and provides a well-told account of the amazing journey to provide life-saving vaccines. By only reasons for not giving it a full five stars were that I thought some of the illustrations might be a bit scary to younger children, and also I thought that the story ended rather abruptly -- it is good, but be prepared to answer youngsters questions such as ""Did Togo get the people the medicine?"" and ""Why didn't Togo get to finish his race?"" See also Big Enough Anna, by Pam Flowers, for a very different story that also involves sled dogs."
3,I found it!,"Aha! I re-found the book I read no so long ago! It's better than this one, because it was written by Seppala's good friend, Elizabeth Ricker. It's from 1930. It's called Seppala, Alaskan Dog Driver. Yeah, I know, Togo is a children's book. But personally, I prefer the longer books with more information and real photos packed into them. In that case, it's Ms. Ricker's book for me! But who am I to put down this book, if you or your kids like it? Go buy it now!"
1,Not very good,Repetitive and largely pointless. Not well written. Apparently the author's spell-checker malfunctioned too.
5,This book takes you to a place you don't even know exists.,This book shows the sustaining power of love and spirituality. I recommend it if you are looking for meaning in your life.
4,Inspiring and Entertaining,"While this read repeats some material offered in the first Dannion Brinkley book, I nevertheless reaped additional and essential knowledge and inspiration. Indeed, there was a sense throughout of a graceful acceptance that one eventually will gain awareness concerning the evolution of the soul--that knowledge of this great work we are all participating in is as inevitable as, say, birth and death and rebirth.I appreciated, as well, how this book built upon the original story of Dannion's NDE experience--how Dannion's entire life had been transformed through a greater understanding of the processes we all are a part of and eventually will have awareness of. I consider it, along with other Dannion Brinkley books, an essential addition to my spiritual library."
1,Nice first draft,"The story is uneven and slow in places. Some of the dialogue is stilted and the editing is non-existant. I found many typos and dialogue that was credited to the wrong character or not at all, leaving it uncertain who was speaking. One short paragraph was so badly mangled it made no sense at all.I have read a lot of Marion Chesney, both the romances and the M.C. Beaton mysteries. Parts of this book seemed to be written by someone else. The writing is not as strong and descriptive as Chesney usually is and some of the actions and dialogue do not fit the characters I have come to know from the first two books. The storyline itself is very slow and almost disappears for a while before finally returning to the mystery of the murder.Also, in this book, it is stated that Captain Cathcart forgot to give Lady Rose an engagement ring, however, in ""Hasty Death"" the ring was clearly given."
3,Pretty Good,"While this is nowhere near Chesney's best writing (see either the Daughters of Mannerling or the Poor Relation series for a wickedly funny read), it is still moderately enjoyable. Some (but not enough) of her trademark humor is present, and the mystery is nicely done. But I very much miss her wit and brilliant, outrageous characterizations and hope she will ditch this field of inquiry (the Edwardian Age) and return to Regencies post haste."
2,Sick of shadows of doubt,"This book is a good cozy read but I don't think Ms. Chesney wrote it. In the second book he gave her a ring and in this book it said that he didn't. Also, lets get these two together already. I am sick of their stupid lack of communication. This could be a great series if they just got married and solved mysteries like in the Pitt books by Anne Perry. My advise is wait for the paperback or use your library."
5,A very enjoyable story,I love M.C. Beaton and I love period novels. This was a fun read. I wish she would add more to the series.
2,Honestly a Waste of Time,"Okay, I admit it. I was intrigued with the plot of the book. The whole idea about being inside a guy's mind, knowing what he is thinking 24/7, is tantalizing. But this book is really a waste of time. No joke. I mean, an entire school of only beautiful girls? Anyone who finds this book ""amazing"" is seriously deprived. The characters are jerks, especially Gideon. Maybe I'm being too harsh and I am oblivious to what happens in the ""real world"" and in teenage life. But I have to say this book was trash. Completely predictable and unrealistic. Hey, anyone who likes reading this kind of fiction, go right ahead. But while you read it, just think of all the other productive things you could be doing."
4,Monster Truck History,"We ordered this book for my 3 year old son who is really into Monster trucks right now. Of course he can't read so he just looks at the pictures, but I have read a few pages here and there during the thousands of times we have looked at it, and it is actually pretty interesting! It discusses the conception of monster trucks, how Bigfoot really changed the whole thing and then how it turned from a novelty into more of a sport. It is a very informative book. And the photos are terrific. As a 35 year old woman, I never thought I would learn about things like monster trucks... but having two sons has changed that idea. :-) This is a good book for any age looking to find out more about monster trucks!"
2,Waxes and Wanes,"This book has its moments of quality here and there, but for the most part it is a droning, pseudo-scientific disappointment. About half way through I noticed that almost all (I didn't count) ""survey"" entries were written by women. (Did only women respond to her survey?) All survey entries were written in the same sugary ""chicken soup for the soul"" style and were obviously edited and re-written by the author. Two thirds of the way through the book, the author's self-aggrandizing style became louder and louder. When I read her account of George Anderson's ""reading"" of the author, I almost threw the book away when I read the part where he tells her that she will become very wealthy-- ""not one million... many millions"" and ""be offered a new career... writing.""It took work forcing myself to finish reading this book and afterward I felt I had wasted a lot of time."
3,Reincarnation,Very interesting anecdotal stories of peoples live adventures. She seems to take up where Ien Stevenson left off. Good length. Different stories each time you pick up the book so you don't have to worry about finishing it all in one day. Most enjoyable for those interested in the progression of the soul.
3,60's counter-psychadelic,"I doubt that this is readily available anywhere. (Check out the $70 price for the CD on Amazon!) I got hung up on looking for it to see if there were other songs by The Neon Philharmonic beyond Morning Girl, which is still one of my favorites from the era. I bought it as used vinyl, promo copy. Oops. Morning Girl, Later is a cool and nearly an identical follow up but beyond that.... I was a disc jockey during the time this was released and if I had the opportunity to add it to my collection, I understand why I didn't. It's three stars for the nostalgic love of most music from those years not for the quality of the music overall.Don't go looking for it but if you're into period pieces, pick it up if the price is right.(Obviously $70 is not.)"
3,Not really what I excpected,"Sundazed have released a lot of 60's treasures in their huge output, but this has to be one of the worst. I was looking for a melodic and light-psychedelic soft album. But this is just too plain boring and mellow. Heading off into a musical direction rather than pop-psychedelia. The compositions are ranging from very radio-friendly and commercial to slightly better ones with at least a hint of light pop-psych. Don't do my mistake and excpet a forgotten psychedlic album or even a decent forgotten 60's album, because it's neither."
2,What the dilly yo?,"Oh my God! This album is not excellent. I think these guys were smoking the doge! Oh my God! This album can't compare to in my opinion the best album of last year, Hybrid Theory by Linkin Park. Shut up when I'm talking to you. I was thinking about how a moth could confess and I was like whoah...that would be weird. And then Raul was like shut up anthe bitkos. And I was like, no you shut up, you fool. Do you know that moth's wings are made of carbo-hydro-benthenol. Oh my God! You can make sound bombs out of that, and people will think you're a badass. Especially if you see them and say, ""What up?""Peace out, brother,Anthe Bitkos Ahn"
5,Amazing!,"I read this book many times almost 50 years ago as a child and when my daughter read it almost 20 years ago, she inspired me to re-read it. I was amazed. I had learned most of my best parenting lessons from this book! Father tells the children that ""A guest's first responsability is to have a good time."" - something I had been telling my children for years, but I had no recollection of having read it. This is just one example of many incidents. It's a wonderful story for children over the age of eight and for adults who enjoy a good story."
5,...the dream world I wished to visit.,"I too was read this book in school by a wonderfully inspired teacher. I then checked it out as often as possible. Years passed and I finally found a copy of it in our local library. Low and behold they were just going to throw it out. The wonderful librarian gave me the copy, still in perfect condition. I cherish this book and the still read it faithfully though now I mostly quote it to myself.It is such an inspiring story, full of adventures I lived with each of the children...I can relate to all of the children and somehow think my own personality and the fun I enjoy creating with my own daughter and my grandsons is some how in part due to the fun time ""we"" all experienced at Buckhorn.Am not surprised in the least that it is a collector's item now :)"
5,Jerry at his best!,"This live collaboration between Jerry Garcia and Howard Wales is a great album. I can put it on, let it go and have some terrific music. There are only 4 tracks; All for Life is my favorite. A must for any fan of Jerry Garcia."
5,Texas music at its finest!!,"A friend turned me on to Johnnie, thanks Steve. After hearing him play live once I was hooked. This is a must buy CD if you like Texas music. The song writing is fantastic and you can relate to each track. If you don't like this album you just don't like music."
5,Just what I needed,"I needed some pages to put pictures in that would fit a normal size binder, they seem great quality and were perfect for what I needed."
4,Good Product,I have bought these photo pages before and like them especially for the vertical photos.
5,a well kept secret....,The book is outstanding value; it has depth of knowledge and plenty of actionable recommendation like no other (or consultants for that matter...). It shows you the real problems and opportunities of CRM in action.
5,A much awaited book,"If you ever forget that ""information technology"" Technology is a mean and information is a must, read this book with attentionA great analysis of our future and the role of information, and more precisely customer informationOne of the essential about Customer Knowledge Management"
4,Je Suis France Fantastic Area!,"A classic example of the early work of Je Suis France circa the early 21st century. For those who are curious this release does infact predate their infamous 'slogan songs' period which took over their catalog of songs a year later. What you get here is an example of all which was good in independent music of the 1990's. Scorching guitars, inside jokes, and most importantly..."
2,"Wildly uneven, and not satisfying","These Spanish guys have not decided what they want to be. There are some bombastic rough edged tunes, some ballads, and some straight ahead pop/rock. The latter is by far the most compelling, and the ballads (besides Rain) are very nondescript. The cover songs are abysmal (especially Hungry Heart). That was a very mediocre Springsteen song anyway, but believe me, you don't want to hear this. If they stick to the mid-tempo stuff next time; they may warrant another listen."
2,Interresting sound but so heavy.,"I'm affraid this soundtrack is not sogood than I thought. Interresting sound of 69, nice production but the execution has absolutely no charm, not fine at all ; mostly clumsy and somtimes ridiculous (unskilled manierism). But it's a well of samples !!!"
1,Not Worth It,"The music had too much brass; I was hoping for heavy, dripping, gothic guitars. It was like Herb Albert on acid (so now I suppose you'll all order it, right?) It was not a mood-setter; it was obnoxious. HOWEVER, the photos are quite yum."
2,"corny,but a couple of catchy tracks","The first few tracks i like, but the rest of the album doesn't cut the mustard. It's psychedelic lounge easy listening vacuous drivel, but it is good for a party i guess. Most of the later stuff on the album is dreadfully boring to listen to though. This is not music for the ages, it's the score to a Z grade lesbo vampire flick(s). I've heard that the films are atrocious pap. I cannot recommend this album. Thank you."
2,Refrigeration for pleasureboats,"Not very good for practical applications. If you like plenty of theory and equations its great, if you are trying to use it so you could repair and maintain your system it is weak and of not much value."
3,"Great Book, But...","This is a great book, but Nigel Calder could spend some time updating it because 99% of the focus is on that very destructive R12 refrigerant (which was the weapon of choice when the book was published in 1990) and there is only a brief mention of R134a refrigerant, which most modern boats now use."
3,Refrigeration for Pleasureboats,"Twenty years ago I would have rated this book 5 stars but a lot has changed in the last twenty years in refrigeration. That said there is still a lot of very good information in this book but one needs to be able to apply the theory to modern refrigerants. I don't know of a better book on small marine refrigeration.Refrigeration for Pleasureboats: Installation, Maintenance and Repair"
4,Cute furniture set,"My 5 year old was thrilled to finally have a ""big bed"" for her Dora doll house. Mami and Papi fit on the bed just fine, if a bit crowded, and they haven't fallen off yet. The vanity is cute and my dd actually put it in Dora's downstairs bathroom since the upstairs is a bit crowded with the oversize furniture. She is using the bench as a footrest with the living room couch. So overall a useful furniture set for more than just a bedroom!"
5,Product Change,"The Memorex CD-RW Pocket Disc I ordered were the ones that worked with my camera MVC-CD400 butthe Pocket Disc changed and I was sent the new ones. They only add 210MB/MO to the name andnow they do not work with my camera. The original ones had 210MB only.I would recommend the product to my friends if it work with their cameras so it rates fivestars but for me now it rates one star since I can't use them anymore. I did find someCW-R that worked but after I took the disc out of my camera and down load the pictures,it would not work again like I closed the disc when I did not.Sure which I could find the original CD-RW package again."
4,great product. recieved product in reasonalble time.,I got the Pocket CD-rw and have no problems with them. Great product. Meets all expectations.
1,Sony Incompatible,"We also purchased these as an alternate to the Sony Mavica CD. We spent a fabulous week in Bermuda. We filled the first disk on the first day only to have it say ""Disc Error"" when we tried to finalize it. And so we were left with no pictures and no disks to take pictures for the rest of the week. VERY IRRITATING"
4,It's a good attempt,"Ok, so, I know a lot of people have slagged off this movie (pretty much all of my mates) but personally I thought it was a good attempt. If you like movies such as Scream, Halloween and Friday the 13th - this movie is for you. Yes it is very typically a teen-slasher movie, but the storyline is interesting from the start and not as predictable as one might expect. If nothing else, this movie will keep you entertained as one may laugh hysterically as all the...actors are nicely finished off by a friendly looking clown. Not one for the faint hearted me thinks."
4,The clown at midnight,"This movie is a great slasher like movie.I think this movie is VERY scarey beacouse I hate clowns.This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Most likley you will be thinking who is the clown? This movie is not like ""IT"" this clown uses weapons from throwing throwing pepole off buildings. This movie is not that gory but good.I think of this movie as a mystery."
1,It was weak...,"K, so this movie was pretty weak...hello, they didn't freakin make out at the end! We were waiting for George and Kate to start gettin' freaky and the wuss just hugged her head...what's that all about? He needs to work on his game. The sex scene was definitely entertaining...talk about how you give the guy props from hitting it from the backside...and the intertwining of the sword fight was classic. Hmm, maybe I should give it 2 stars instead..."
5,clown at midnight the best,i saw this movie in 1999 when i was 11 yrs old. i didn't off into much but after 2000 came and went i loved ever since. it is scary and has a good story line. unlike most today this film is a good movie if u are into horror films. i'm not fan of any video to video horror films but this was the best i loved it.
5,A Family is Complete,"Here We All Are (26 Fairmount Avenue)The next book in a wonderful series by Tomie dePaola, this short chapter book written especially for his chosen audience, is the part of his life when his family is completed; his baby sister is born. Parents and children will love the easy way that Tomie blends the real view points of children with the stuff that adults think is so important. Bravo."
3,A Nice Book But Much Religious Content,"dePaola's book is a very realisitic view of the world from a kindergartener's point-of-view, but it is laden with Christian symbols and content. Being a religious non-Christian, I can't read this to my own 5-year-old without heavily editing the text. I wish I had known this beforehand...."
4,An Atlas of English Dialects,"I got the soft-back version of this book, from the used section. This is a small book, but it is packed with useful info. Each page has a map and then a discorse on the way in which certain phrases are spoken across the UK. If you have an interest in linguistics you could find this impressive from a technical point of view. I bought the book to 'translate' a written exert from a novel into the Geordie dialect for a ProofReading exercise. Writers may also find it useful for making a character richer by giving him/her an accent. I found it a good general read for amusement, too."
2,Poor print quality,"This review is only regarding the physical quality of the book. It looks like a print-on-demand book. So if that would bother you, better look for a copy of the original printing. I did give it two stars instead of one, though, because I have seen much worse."
3,Only for *advanced* programmers,"I bought this book several years ago, and still haven't managed to make my way through it. The text is sometimes hard to follow, the code fragments even harder, requiring the reader to jump back several (sometimes dozens of) pages to references made. This text seemed more suited to University level Computer Science students than to the average Joe Schmoe who just wants to write a C compiler. Overall, this is a good book that details the gory insides of a compiler very well, and the added bonus of being able to get the source code is essential, as viewing the complete code while reading the book is almost a necessity, but it's not for the average/intermediate level coder."
3,The men behind the Little Corporal,"This is a 19th century look at Napoleon's marshals, with a brief chapter on each of them. Taken together they were a diverse lot in background, skills, military ability and fate. Some of them, such as Davout, were the brilliant soldiers we associate with Napoleon's marshals, some of them had other skills, such as organization, and some of them well, they ended up as marshals.Not the latest word on the subject, but an easy, interesting read that throws light on the Napoleonic Wars."
4,Marshal Ney blazes across the pages of history!,"Excellent background on the Marshals of France. Goes well with Delderfields ""The Sixteen"" (Pen and Sword). I'd read them both....after you've read David Chandler. Marshal Ney blazes across the pages of history!"
3,Reads like someone's doctoral thesis,"I have to say that I have found this book to be interesting with regard to the large number of historical, mythical, folkloric and legendary references that Douglas employs. He definitely did his homework and it shows in every sentence of the book.But therein lies the fault I find with the book. With the exception of a few brief moments where Douglas manages to smirk at himself, his writing style is largely (and annoyingly) pedantic. He approaches the subject seriously, but he takes it to the point of stuffiness.I also found that a lot (and I mean A LOT) of the information Douglas spends page after page running into the ground had little or nothing to do with the subject of werewolves. His interest seemed much more focused on displaying his copious (albeit only indirectly relevant) research and knowledge than in writing a digestible book about werewolves."
5,"Thorough, comprehensive and complete","I was trying to find The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy by Adam Douglas at my university library, but then when I found Douglas Adams The Beast Within instead, I happened upon this gem of a book. Taking a chronlogical approach, Adams traces the origins of the werewolf myth from its abstract beginnings in myths and legends to its common usage in pop culture. Not only did I learn much about the werewolf legend, but also things I never knew about the Salam witch trails, Christianity and their conflict with Paganism and all sort of useful bit of random knowledge. Definately one of my favourite non-fiction books."
1,I have read it all before- nothing new,This book offers nothing new on the topic of serial murder. It has all been said before.
5,Love it,"'Persereve' made me laugh and cry - it is brilliant. As always, the Proclaimers sing their hearts out and there is something on this album for everyone. (And I loved 'Hit The Highway'!)"
1,Save Your Money,"I too purchased this from the bargain bin (2 DVD for around $5). I would compare the quality to that of an old worn out VHS tape thats been recorded over far too many times. The acting was ok, but the storyline and the video quality make it hard to watch."
1,a dvd to disregard,"1980s movie and it shows. Sharon Stone and co-stars do a fair job. The dvd video is extremely poor on my copy. It looks like a bootleg but it is not. Story line has been done before and since and is very predictable. I sat through it only because I bought it out of a bargain bin and figured since I paid for it, I might as well watch it all.Save your money and your time. Pass on this one at any price."
3,"So Close, But Yet So Far!","A pivotal and defining moment in the history of Whalers hockey. After their game 7 OT victory in this game, the Montreal Canadians went on to win the Stanley Cup with relative ease. Leading this life long Whalers fan to always believe had the Whalers prevailed in this Game 7 that they too would have gone on to win the cup that year. Leaving one to wonder (until this very day)if there had been a Stanley Champion in Hartford, would they have ever been allowed to have been taken to Raleigh, NC. They may be gone, but they will forever be in they hearts and minds of the people and fans of Hartford and Connecticut. Brass Bonanza will play on as will our memories of our beloved Whalers. I bleed Green...........Forever!"
3,Make sure you don't need M3 Motherboard Risers,"The quality of the kit is great, and if the motherboard risers you need are 6-32 then you'll be set. If you need M3 risers, like I did, then this won't have the risers you need."
3,Helpful,"Well organized, but I think a bit pricey. Helpful when you need that little part or screw that you either lost or don't have."
2,Bad Package idea,"Let me start of by saying that I love the idea of this product and I love the screws and stuff that came in the product. But what is so poor about this product is that the package it came in was an awful idea. When I received the product, the jumpers had all been mixed into different sections because when you close the lid, there is a space between the lid and the walls of each section where they can then move about the container. So I then tried to get all of the jumpers out of the sections, but then I realized that the walls can just slide up. Then *everything* became mixed. Not fun, and not cool. I am now using empty baby food jars to store the screws and jumpers."
4,Shocked,"SOLD, is a heart wrenching true story. It got me so angry what happened to Zana and her Sister in this book, not to mention the frustration that the Mother went through. To have a Father that literally SOLD his two gorgeious daughters off into a land where women are treated worse than animals, completely frustrates me. This book is amazing, Zana's journey is amazing. It makes me feel like I have nothing to complain about. It makes me greatful to have what I have."
2,Fred Waring This is NOT!,"While I am glad that this recording has been released, I'm sorry to say that Jimmy Joyce's group just doesn't do justice to these carols like Fred Waring and The Pennsylvanians did in their recordings. Maybe someday the record companies will ""get a clue"" and re-release Waring's versions of these absolutely phenomenal and all-too-little heard carols by Burt in a CD format. Until then, I'll just have to wear the grooves deeper into my album of Waring's versions....and make due with the Jimmy Joyce CD!!!"
4,Alfred Burt Carols,"I first became acquainted with the Alfred Burt carols via Fred Waring. They are enjoyable songs, some more familiar than others. Enjoyable seasonal music."
3,"A bit anemic, but glad someone has preserved these classics","The arranegments are a little odd in places and the Jimmy Joyce Voices sound much like a high school glee club, but overall it is a pleasure to hear the wonderful carols of Alfred Burt all on one single recording. Perhaps the Fred Waring renditions will soon be available."
3,Tastes alright I guess,"supposedly healthier, but the nutrition label is pretty similar to regular spaghetti ... the taste is just 'ok'. If you're into organic, this is fine to get."
4,Seller Responded to Problem,"The CD that I was sent was scratched. When I informed the seller, he responded immediately. He replaced the used CD with another CD. He did this quickly.The seller took responsibility and corrected the problem in a timely manner."
3,Nice watch for the price,It is very attractive but watch face is a little small and is more of a light blue than a silver
4,Smoke Signals,"Bought this for my husband who had watched it on Netflix. He loves it and always wants to show it to our friends. Even my daughters friends are now saying ""Hey Victor!""."
5,"This movie is excellent, a must see","This is a truly awesome film. It isn't often that we get to see something through a different pair of glasses. Obviously, Maltin had on his regular pair. The movie taught me about Indian life today on the ""Res"", breaking down many misconceptions. I actually believed the line I'd been fed that Indian life was dead. It's obviously alive and healthy. Thank God. Watch this movie. Own it and watch it again."
5,The absolute best movie of 1998,I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my seat. This is by far the best portrayal of rez life ever put on film for the public. I urge everyone native and non-native to see this movie.
5,Definitely on my Lifetime Favorites list,"This movie could easily have slipped into cheesy airbrushed cliche and bad voiceovers. Instead, it offered flawed heroes, true friends, real love, understanding, compassion and wisdom. It was a perfect whole made up of even more perfect moments."
1,worst movie ever,wanna see the worst movie ever?? see this movie and then kick yourself for watching it.
5,Smoke Signals DVD,The DVD was new in excellent condition and was delivered in an extremely short time.
5,The best independent movie of 1998,"Funny, touching, revealing, educating ... easily one of the best movies of the year"
5,"The movie ""Smoke Signals "" as a class assignment.","I use the movie ""Smoke Signals"" in my university level Interpersonal Communication class to discuss and write about the relationships in the film and the way the communication functions to form the relationships. This film is timeless, in that the clothing and vehicles on the ""Rez"" don't have to be the most current. The cast of Native Americans adds diversity and cultural elements for discussion. Best of all, few have seen it so all can start at the same point and not get bored with something they had seen. I have now viewed the film about 25 times and always find a new element to appreciate, if it is the symbolism of fire in the film, the theme of wishful magic, or the role of women on the Rez. It is a wonderful film and I recommend it for enjoyment and/or educational use."
3,the two tonto road trip,"Sons and fathers on the reservation where there is no future,but a very bad past. Most Native Americans are the survivorsof a documented past and a stolen land.We have two young Indian boys who become menwhen the one who saved Thomas and fathered Victordies in exile in Arizona. The actors mostly talk with a Canadianaccent/ cadence.Since the reservation gambling Native Americans have gainedsome wealth and maybe a future, but this movie dealswith the isolation and desolation along with alcoholismthat has plagued them in the 20th century.A culture or cultures on the trail of rebirth needs films like thisfor identity."
3,Fan of native cinema wanted to like it more..,"The only reason I wanted to watch this film was because it was done entirely by native americans. Unfortunately that seems to be about it's main claim to fame.The movie is not BAD its just about average. It doesn't really stand out in any way and will probably mostly be of interest to other native americans. There is some quirky and clever humor but any at least coming of age story should have something like that in there. I didn't find it exceptionally endearing. Unlike other native-centric cinema like Windwalker, or Dreamkeeper, there are not layers of subtle humor that 'insiders' (those raised in or deeply involved in native culture, like red road people) will pick up that normal watchers wont get. It's just what you see is what you get.If your native it's probably worth a rental. But there are better movies (like Windwalker or Dreamkeeper) to buy if you don't already have them and are just looking for some native american cinema."
3,Too much of the sledgehammer,"Although this movie is earnest and interesting as a look inside reservation life, it all too often comes across as heavy-handed. Do Indians today really spend almost all their time talking about Columbus and missionaries? The dialogue seemed to mainly serve as a soapbox for the director's political views, rather than as honest conversation among real people. The director does occassionally drop the preaching to show the two friends trying to come to terms with their lives and intertwined histories and it's these parts that elevate the film. If only the whole movie could have been like that..."
5,Put this in your pipe and smoke it,"If only movies like ""Smoke Signals"" were box-office hits, the world would be a better place. Sundance Films recognized this movie's brilliance, so that is something. This movie of friendship and family is both incredibly moving and incredibly funny. I had no idea who the actors (Adam Beach, Evan Adams) were when I rented this movie. I think I was intrigued by the fact that it was a Native American film, and I have an interest in Native American art, literature, music and film. You will be even more touched if you happened to have grown up with an alcoholic father. I rented the movie twice, heard one of the songs from the film, ""John Wayne's Teeth"" on the radio this past Thanksgiving, and ordered the DVD online the next day. It is one of my favorite movies ever!"
5,Hillarious and Heartwarming,"Smoke Signals is both delightful and educational. I grew to love the characters, especially Thomas Builds the Fire and Victor Joseph. Thomas, orphaned by a tragic fire, is raised by his grandmother to carry on the oral tradition of the tribe as a storyteller and he understands the value of elaborate embellishment in making history. Victor, abandoned by his father, Arnold Joseph, at the age of 12 becomes a bully but that is not the end of the story. It is the story of surviving a dying culture where everything is magical with the help of humor, imagination, and forgiveness. But the culture lives on in stories such as this. Everyone can benifit from their examples. After all, if we forgive others, who is left to blame for our unhappiness?"
5,Native American Excellence,"Its hard to write the words that best describe this movie. What an emotional, honest, and respectful piece of work. Chris Eyre really shows his directional skills by composing a masterpiece. Not only do you become emersed in our main characters' journey, but you make your own memories as well. There aren't too many Native American-made movies out there, but this movie is truly among the best of them. It compares to 'Dances with Wolves' and 'Thunderheart' easily! Look for Chris' new movie, 'Skins,' out on DVD. A masterpiece and a must see!"
5,Great movie,One of the best movies I've seen. I bought this copy because I had loaned my orginal one and it was lost. I certainly won't loan this one. The movie is a combination of every emotion. I recommend it for everyone.
4,"A very honest, gripping but upbeat tale.","A very honest look at the problem of alcoholism among Native Americans. This movie worked on a lot of different levels for me. It teaches about life on an Indian reservation and relationships. Most important, it made me feel good. A must see!"
4,"Serious, but has funny moments.","I found this movie to be a rather odd film which you don't usually find very often. I liked the story about a boy and his dad who are separated and the boy goes in search of the father. The humour in the film is rather unique, yet it does fit nicely in with the scenes. I found the film to be a good film for all ages, but there is a scene or two which I had to cringe at (when the father, in the boys memory, smacks him hard for doing something bad, or when the boys parents foght infront of him). They say indians don't smile, well, in this film you see one. In fact, I've never seen a Native American Nerd before, but I can say now after watching the movie that I have. :-) Still I give this film a 4 mainly because it was a great film, but in a way it lacks in the story-telling part of it, which is partly because of some limited acting skills. If you are not used to Hollywood films, then this film is even better."
3,"Smoke Signals - Lots of hype, little in the way of smoke","I may be all wrong, but Smoke Signals did little to improve the image of the Indian. Compare it with something like GrandAvenue...well there just isn't a comparison!"
2,"Boring, Dreary","This movie was boring. This movie was dreary. This movie was drearily boring. Smoke Signals is one of those artsy movies made for critics. The makers of this movie think they're important. People here who give it 5 stars think they're sophisticated and well-rounded, I'm sure."
4,just watch it.,"This movie gives us a lot of knowledge about how Native Americans feel and live their daily life. We can see the real life style of them in the movie because real Native Americans produced it and acted in it, it was very interesting. Communication between the two guys was also very funny. They have a sense of humor and always tried to make their life happy. We can tell from this movie how different values of the White Americans and that of the Native American are."
4,Great movie for sons and fathers... mostly fathers,"This is a great movie from a great collection by Sherman Alexie. While there are certainly important themes about life on the reservation and relations with those of us on the outside, I found this to be an excellent treatment of father-son relationships, particularly when the father falls off the pedestal hard. Ve3ry much worth seeing more than once."
1,not as pictured,"When I ordered this filter, I assumed that it would be as pictured. However when I counted the actual pleats in this filter, there were only 15; the picture showed 21. My old filter, which I purchased locally, also has 21 pleats. This translates to about a 30% loss of surface area, which also means this is a much less efficient air filter. While this may be an unintentional misrepresentation, I am not happy with this product!"
1,Not quite the right size,The filter itself is slightly too long for the Air Bear box. The door wants to keep popping out after putting the filter in. Never had this problem with other filters. Will not buy again.
4,not quite,This filter is not quite as wide as the original but it is servicable for the price we have paid
4,20x25x5 MERV 11 Air Bear High Efficiency Replacement Filter (2 Pack),Filters arrived and looked as advertised. It was a replacement for an Ultravation filter which has foam strips at the top and bottom which this did not. The replacement does fit and appears to be working fine.
3,"Seems OK, but can't prove it","The form and fit were good. The delivery was prompt. The only concern was that there was no MERV 11 marking on the filters. Other filters that I have bought from my HVAC contractor have a MERV 11 certification on the filter. The only thing that stated MERV 11 compliance was on the external shipping box label, so who knows what the MERV level of the actual contents really were."
5,Very happy,The product arrived quickly. Its description was accurate. It is great fit in my furnace. I will definately purchase these filters again from this company.
5,:),I love this tablet! It works really well and has helped me to improve my art. It's easy to use and it didn't take long to get used to using it. Great for art students! :)
4,decent product for the price,"I'm still playing with this, but it'll take some getting used to if you never used a pad. Positioning the pen seems to be touchy and can ruin your work if not careful"
5,Great for digital art,"It takes a little practice, but I can draw on the computer with Photoshop now. It allows the user to make dark / light lines and wide / thin brush strokes by varying the pressure on the stylus. The 'wireless' mouse is pretty neat too. I am not a serious artist, but I did make some cool stuff with this. I am very pleased with this product."
1,"Killer Desgin, Bad Music","TO MaxJazz: Next time try spending some money on your artists and programming instead of packaging!I was expectiing to hear Holiday music, but instead I heard maybe one good artist (Cook) and a bunch of hacks trying to sound like professionals."
1,Not Worth It,"Who decided to throw these artist together and what were they thinking? This CD is like listening to the confused efforts of an immature label.I know JAZZ, and I know good JAZZ. This, it ain't.Carla Cook is the only person on this label worth anything. I suggest she ask for some serious money considering that she is probably the only person responsible for the sales."
3,compare the dosing,"Before getting too excited about this product and the price for 120 tablets, consider the dosing. Two tablets twice a day - so this is a 30 day supply."
1,It's no accident how many mg of Resveratrol is NOT displayed...,Rip off -- only 20mg per capsule. Gimme a break. Sending it back.
4,Great price.,"The product was as advertised. I have only taken these for a week, so I am unsure of the results."
2,"Good Music, Bad Recordings","If you love the artists and titles appearing on this compilation, do yourself a favor and obtain them elsewhere. The music is great, but the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired. I can honestly say that in my own personal music collection, I have perhaps 25% of these exact same songs (not just the same title by the same artist, but the same actual recording) only sounding much, much better than they do on these four CD's.Buy this set only as a last resort!"
5,A great bargain,"This box set holds 80 tracks of Jamaican music from the 1960s. A detailed booklet describes the history of the style and the musicians. The music is relaxed, charming, great fun to listen to. If you've never heard Ska, get this set and try it. The price is a bargain."
4,Comprehensive,"The field of Data Reconciliation have been around since the 1960's. This book is a comprehensive overview of all the relevant material since that period.I bought this book as a reference for work on an M.Eng in the field. It only recieves 4 stars, since the style is sometimes 'wordy', and you have to concentrate to get the point. However, there are very few if any errors, the treatment is thorough and comprehensive, and the references are exhaustive if you are interested in further reading. Value for money.There are not many books in this area, but if you are wondering if you should purchase this one or the work by Romagnoli and Sanchez, buy both! There is obviously some duplication of material, but both books contain information or discussions not treated in the other, and so compliment each other rather well. I found it handy to have both open at the same time."
1,THE DRESS RUNS VERY SMALL!!!,I PURCHASED THIS LITTLE CUTE DRESS LAST MONTH IN MY YORKIE SIZE (XSMALL) THE DRESS IS TOO SMALL...I COULDN'T GET THE DRESS OVER MY PUPPY'S HEAD.... I WROTE A REVIEW ABOUT THE DRESS BEING ONE SIZE TOO SMALL. THE COMPANY (PRO PET SHOP) CALLED ME WITH THE PROMISE OF SENDING ME A LARGER SIZE DRESS ONLY IF I WOULD ERASE MY ORIGINAL REVIEW. HERE IT'S ONE MONTH LATER. I ERASED MY FIRST REVIEW AND I'M STILL WITHOUTA DRESS..I WOULD'VE HAPPY SENT YOU BACK THE TOO TINY DRESS BUT YOU INSISTED ON ME TO KEEP THE DRESS EACH TIMES I CALLED.. THANKS PRO PET SHOP FOR GOING BACK ON YOUR PROMISE!!!!...YOU WON'T GET ANY BUSINESS FROM ME AGAIN!!!!
4,shortened the christmas tasks,"Tommy Sands has a wonderful melancholy voice and combines it with some other great artists on this album. The only miss is""Whiter Shade of Pale"", but ""Welcome here kind stranger"" and ""like the first time, it's Christmas time"" are excellant.Not just for the christmas holidays, it will surely""shorten"" the long march to spring."
5,good series,"I have enjoyed the Aisling Grey series. This is a very good addition to the series. The book develes further into Aisling's relationship with Draco. The only thing that I didn't care for was the book was written in first person, but all the books in series are in that POV. The book is witty and well written, some of the part made laugh out loud. Overall the book was well written and I would recommend it to another person."
5,Aisling Grey - Guardian extraordinary,Katie MacAlister did a fabulous job on this book. Most paranormal romances lately written have been more paranormal less romance. This was a very romantic book with a sweet love story between Aisling and Drake. I was so happy to see Drake finally coming around.....Can't wait for the next one...GREAT WORK.
5,Awesome Book,This is the best book in the Aisling Grey Series so far. I found it captivating from start to finish. It has a lot of suspense & romance. I loved it.
4,I love this series!,"I have read the entire series. And, I'm pre-ordered on book #4. The books all seem to be so tongue in cheek...all of them are just good clean fun reading. Nothing serious...but, not fluff either.I recommend this author. Everything so far has been a blast. I hope she keeps it up. Ya gotta love the dog...I've got two that are almost like him..minus the magic."
4,really cute,"love this character. She's very innocent and yet people keep piling on duties. Aisling fights off having two more titles and loads of responsiblities in this book at the same time trying to be a good mate to Drake and learn how to be a Guardian. Through all this, someone is trying to kill her. I think this is such a light, funny, carefree book, and like other reviewers I'm anxious to read more. I hope MacAlister doesn't put this series on the backburner again."
3,A Bit Disappointing,"Story line started out great. Then the whining about not having enough time as an excuse for everything got annoying.The worst was when Aisling gained yet another ""title"" and set of powers.This kind of thing too often becomes a substitute for a good plot (LK Hamilton comes to mind). There is so much going for this series with the promise of some juicy story lines I'd hate to see it go down hill now."
2,Not as good as the first Aisling Grey novel.,"Well, what can I say. The first book was great, the second, just okay. I couldn't even get into this book. I read maybe the first 3 chapters and couldn't finish the rest."
2,Not so good,"I have been waiting for this installment. I was very disappointed by this book. Too much happens to Ash to be plausable, too much ""not my fault, I didn't have time"" reminds me of LKHamiton just as she started to go down hill. Please don't go there Ms MacAlister! I'll get the next and hope for better."
5,Love this series,"Funny yes, adventurous yes, sexy yes. Couldn't put this book down. It's a story that you don't want to end. On to book number four."
3,Do you find Drake Irritating?,"Is it just me, or is Drake irritating? Apart from some magical destiny induced lust for each other, what is there to love about Drake? He has lied to Aisling, stolen from her, and is very domineering. (There is a difference in Dominance and Domineering). When she asks his help his usual reply is ""What will you give me / do for me, if I help you?"" and if there is something bad happening (like imps setting the room on fire during sex) he demands that she solve the problem, instead of offering to help her with the problem. I wish someone would off Drake so she could get with a nicer guy. Gabriel is looking good so far although there is some suspicion that he may have tried to kill her (I havent finished the 3rd book yet...dont know if thats true or not.)"
3,Buyer Beware: Defective produst,"Beware of defective discs!Mine had bothersome gaps of silence between each track of this otherwise fine live set.I contacted Twilley's web-site and was told that someone screwed up and a lot of these got out before the error was caught.This is not Amazon's fault, but you should check carefully before you buy!I returned mine to Amazon and went to Twilley's site and bought it directly from the source!"
3,Nice variety of pieces and instruments,"This CD features a wide variety of instruments: organ, guitar, piano, harpsicord, harp, strings, and orchestra. Different pieces and instruments have caught my baby's interest at different times. I have also enjoyed listening to them, especially the melancholic Pavane by Debussy. I like to play #2-5 to help baby go to bed. But I have to make sure I turn it off before #6, which gets really loud and wakes her up! Too bad the volume is not consistent between selections (a few really quiet pieces followed by a rather loud piece), so be ready to adjust the volume if you're using it to get the baby to sleep. But it does have a good variety of pieces, from soft melodies to cheery arrangements."
1,Labels won't stick to these inferior greasy envelopes,"I bought envelopes on this advertised heading from ""ValueMailers"" (SELLER). They have a greasy-like substance that will not allow a mailing label to stick. Therefore I have 1000 mailers that require scotch tape to hold on the 3 labels I use when I send out my orders to my customer. I contacted the seller and they refused to pay return shipping and told me to tape on the labels like they do---so, their product is inferior."
5,Tips and Traps When buying a Franchise is a Must Read!,The ABC's of franchising are all in Mary Tomzack's book Tips and Traps When Buying a Franchise. Clearly covered and simply explained are everything you want to and need to know about franchising. This book should be a must read for business majors and anyone interested in franchising. This book is worth the price of the book.
3,I learned - don't buy a franchise.,This book seemed to defer me away from a franchise or maybe my mind was already there. It is a good book if you know next to nothing about franchises other than having been to them.
3,"Eh, okay","Maybe it's just me, but I keep expecting each new Geg CD to be as spectacular as their first - Grand Opening. Who doesn't yearn for another classic like P. Sluff?That said, if you liked their second effort (or the song they had on that car commercial), you'll probably enjoy Into the Oh.But if you're looking for the funk that was on Grand Opening, keep looking."
3,Review of Celltic Prayers from Iona,"I was looking for a book of prayers and this doesn't quite do it. It is more a system of formal prayers and liturgical responses based on daily Bible readings. The prayers there are are fine, it just isn't what I was looking for."
2,Not what I expected,"This is a small book of beautiful thoughts, a nice supplement to liturgy. I was trying to find more substance to plan a Celtic worship service."
2,Just a taste of the real,"I ordered it because it was to be what it is. Devotional prayers for the week and for daily. Excellent reasource for just that; but if you are thirsty for more of the meat rather than drinking milk, keep looking. More are available and we need to share what we find. If you as I am seeking more indepth before the visit, and you find ""share"". Good intro for Iona Celtic Prayer."
2,Nice try Dr. Bratman,"I'm going to have to agree that we simply cannot achieve optimum health by accounting quantitatively and qualitatively every nutrient we place in our body. Conversely, one should see thru the underlying agenda of this very misguided physician. He's attempting to remove the last bastion of control that the populace has over their individual health by creating a 'disease' with some psycho-babble jargon. The result would be to take back the billions of dollars lost by pharmaceutical companies to the natural-health movement. Having personally recovered from a disease thru elimination of processed foods, this issue is very personal to me.I often wonder what terrific perks Dr. Bratman receives from these same pharmaceutical companies for serving as their propaganda machine. Be wary of a charlatan such as this gentlemen who's trying to medicalize your behavior and take away your personal freedoms. With that, I'm off to steam some broccoli and take a multivitamin."
1,A hilarious read!,"One would think 'ORTHOREXIA', not being a true medical diagnosis, could at least appear in a peer-reviewed journal. Dr. Bratman plays on the ignorance of the masses who know not what makes good science. Something tells me Dr. Bratman is a University of Jamaica graduate.On a 'traditional' 'healthy' American diet: 5'9"", high blood pressure (170/90), overweight 200#, hypercholesterolemia (210g/dl).Modified with drugs: Cholesterol: 200, bp 160/88, still high.Drug free on a vegan diet: weight 160, blood pressure 110/70, cholesterol 100.... and THOUSANDS of peer reviewed medical journals supporting veganism.I smile at the ignorant."
1,Useless,"Dr. Bratman assumes that because he had some sort of eating problem, everyone else who eats in a healthy manner does as well. Quite simply, he has no evidence to back up his false claims. His book largely contains anecdotes, with no studies to prove his theories.This is not a good book. Thumbsdown"
1,New Era Knockoff,This hat does not fit as it would in stores. It is clearly made of different materials. Save yourself the time and hassle and buy a real hat.
5,S.H.I.T. - Secret Hate Is Truth,"If you're a purist of classic hardcore punk then this CD is a must have for you to own. The first seven tracks are from Secret Hate's Vegetables Dancing EP from 1983 and they'really awesome; the rest of the CD is awesome too, but especially the first seven. The EP was originally released on the Minutemen's New Alliance label."
2,Low light and button change,Buttons on watch are too easy to press unexpectedly. So your mode will change. The screen is a yellow tint and its difficult to see night or day.
3,Little slimmer than what I wanted..,"I have always had a liking for Casio digital wrist watches, they are simple, all-weather, and give me the time in 2 formats and other standard features found in today's watches!Cons:- Online images do not give a good idea about the actual size so this purchase fell short of 100% satisfaction.- The back light is very ordinary, I think they could have done much better even with the low price tagBut I am enjoying it anyway...."
3,An adequate watch...,"Adequate in the way I needed a watch to be. It aint pretty, the wrist band is plastic -I like cloth- and the light is a small led. I'll probably look for another one with a cloth style wrist band to cater to my predilections, but this one is.. adequate."
3,It look good at web site,"When I received this watch, it does not look as good as picture shows. The yellow back ground is not bright and actually is hard to read the time(or display is too small). The watch band is also too soft, the extra band always in the way.But, it just a $15 watch and it's water resist and a stop watch, I wear it to swim with no problem."
3,Cassio mens watch HDD600-9V,"very nice light wight watch, looking for 100m water proof watch with and alarm. Alarm stinks just can hear it which was a disa ppointment. but over for the price so far so good and I am okay with it."
1,battery die to soon,well i did buy this watch about 8 months ago and battery die already and the battery should last 10 yrs at least so i am not happy about it if they goint to sell watches like that i wont buy any more thats my opinion.
5,Love Those Raiders!,"The height of Raidermania! Him or ME boogies on! Then a sexy riff called Reno. Then Upon Your Leaving followed by Mo'Reen(anti drug). Mark's Wanting You ""rap"" then Gone Movin' On. Side 2 starts with I Had A Dream!Then Tighter & Make it With Me. Paul's a hoot with Ain't Nobody Who Can Do It Like Leslie Can(PR's 1st wife)& finally: the erie I Hear A Voice.CD Extra: the 45 version of Ups & Downs/the Legend of Paul Revere & a tune called Try Some Of Mine. GROOVY!!! FAR OUT!!! COOL!!!"
5,Big Water Spinning Reel,Matches my SP 1186-2M Uglystik rod perfectly for balance and weight and looks great too!
4,Reall good for dora the explorer,i just received for my birthday and i really like it.i really dont like dora th eexplorer so i use it for my FISHER PRICE dollhouse people.what gets really annoying is that the swing goes up but it doesnt come back down until you pull it.the slide is reall cool though.what i think is the coolest part is that the tree opens up into a club house.it has a desser with books and a pretend dragon on it.maybe th eswing works on other ones so i guess i would buy it.
5,Great,"I have many of these because is the best way to keep my photos organized, and it does not need an special album, a regular 3 ring folder is enough."
1,Still waiting on refund/replacement,"I sent this item back was not what it said. waiting on refund or replacement, then I'll give a rate. The item was not a Karaoke CD as the photo and product details said it was."
1,Unreadable. do not buy Kindle edition.,"Typeset is faded, can not read ""model"" as model but some word from outer planet somewhere, several words are dissected into two words, e.g. ""that"" sometimes printed as ""t hat"", ""stochastics"" written as ""stochast ic"" and so on; I could find the dissections *several* times on one view on my iPhone-Kindle. I would like to claim refund, or replacement with the hard cover edition which I expect much readable."
1,Ugh - I'd like to give this one negative stars...,"...and it deserves it due to lack of plot, lack of character development and lack of anything that makes a romance novel a romance novel. I like erotic romance as much as the next person, and have enjoyed Susan Johnson's novels, however there was absolutely nothing erotic or romantic about this novel. The sex scenes had no spark, there was no fire between any of the characters, they just fall into bed with each other. This was definitely a case of telling without showing, and it's unfortunately a waste of money."
1,Not worth the time,"This a rambling, disorganized waste of time. It's probably more approximates ""Chick Lit"" than a true appeal to a reader's hope for a romantic escape. Again Johnson displays poor characterization, overemphasis on sexual details, not quite believable ""sex talk"" and totally ""modern"" bitchy,women's libbers who delight in being with it and bashing all men. This is escape romance? Can I identify with any of the characters? No way! Would I want to be any one of them? Nope. Susan J. wrote wonderful books when she first published. I kept them all. Her writing has deteriorated into pages and pages of meaningless conversation between the protagonists and dirty details of sexual intimacy devoid of human feeling. Where is the foreplay both mental and physical? I will no longer buy any of her books!!"
1,But there's no plot!!,"Susan Johnson has done it again - soft porn without interest. Even the old Playboy stories had more characterization and plotting than Johnson now serves up. If all we're going to get is sex, it could at least be more interesting. Thumbs down!"
1,ewwwww,"This book was terrible! I enjoy a good romance mixed with a lot of passion, but this book failed on both accounts. There is no real plot to the story and someone must have poured cold water on the hot passion because it was sex, that read more like a how to guide, then a story. I tried finishing this book for 3 months, but could not do it. I had heard a lot of good things about Ms. Johnson's writing, but I am afraid to read the other books that I have of her's because of this book. If you must read this book do yourself the favor of finding it for a dollar or less, other wise you are wasting your money."
2,Not much of a history turtuously written,"- Ungainly and confusing prose style.- Interesting subject taken as far as it could go, given the paucity of sources (I'll give the book that), but more detail of the cultural, political, and technological milieu would have made this a real book instead of a padded journal article."
1,Almost unreadable,"A jumbled narrative of conjecture, useless facts and footnotes. The author seemingly doesn't know what story she wants to tell and when she deviates from the main storyline you are left confused as to why she is boring you with anecdotal background that does little to help the story. I would rather suggest you read Batavia's Graveyard. A story of shipwreck and mutiny in which the background (The rise and operation of the Dutch East India Co.) is as interesting as the shipwreck itself."
3,uninhabited island,"Im in a country discovered by modern Sea explorers almost a century after Selkirk was stranded on his own little island. I find it truly amazing to think that this actually happened, and the whole book for me was like this, sheer amazment of this happened, people exploring the uncharted seas in wooden boats, pirates, deserted islands with no inhabitants.......love those old stories. Would have liked the book twice as long with more info, but enjoyed just the same. Three and a half stars."
2,depressingly negative,"The author describes the history of Selkirk's life, including being marooned on an uninhabited islandfor four years and four months. Selkirk's contemporary Daniel Defoe made his story into the famous novel Robinson Crusoe. To round out her historical research, the author apparently took a brief trip to theisland itself, now part of Chile. I was disappointed with the author's consistently negative attitude. I can wellbelieve that Selkirk was an anti-social and violent man, and that the pirates he sailed with were greedy and cruel.But I at least hoped that the author would have a few positive things to say about the island that allowed Selkirk to live and thrive for so long. But no, even her description of the island as it is today dwells on the way the few inhabitants are despoiling the place. Only the book's few grainy B & W photographs hint at the fantasticbeauty of the island. Too bad the author apparently didn't enjoy the place."
2,Not even average,"This book I'd rate below average. Its really just a mess of conjecture. Although, to be fair, since Selkirk didn't keep journals, that really is all the author had to go on. I was disappointed by the lack of information regarding Selkirk's four years on the island. When it came down to it, we really only had less than a chapter that dealt with those years. Also, I read this book after having read Mike Dash's incredible effort, Batavia's Graveyard. If you're reading this review, I'd like to point you to that book instead. Dash truly is an inspired writer. Batavia is a gem. This book...not so much. Honestly, the only real reason I gave it two stars and finished it was because I paid for it. This book was better off out of print. Boo."
3,Very Little About Selkirk,"While Souhami does an admirable job describing what life MAY have been like for Selkirk, it is mostly conjecture, as Selkirk left no journal behind to document his life on the island. Instead, most of the book is about Selkirk's voyages at sea, including his quest for riches with the famous buccaneer William Dampier. Souhami also spends some time reviewing the major works of literature emanating from Selkirk's travails, but her discussion of them adds little to our understanding of Selkirk's experiences after he was rescued. In the end, we know very little about Selkirk's days marooned, and even less about their effects on the rest of his life."
5,a wonderful sense of the absurd,A wonderful book that masterfully explores ideas of cultural constructions of belief.
5,Really unexpected.,"I bought this one because is produced by Willy DeVille. Willy passed away some years ago and I still miss him dearly so I just bought it regardless of the artist. Well, big was my surprise because from the first listening this record revealed itself as an amazing collection of songs and Willy permeates the sound big time. So this is what I wanted and I got it. Can't be happier. From ""Dance hall girls"" to ""Shake sugaree"" to"" Great speckled bird"". All of them. This Is a mixture of Country Blues, Old Time, Southwestern flavor...If you like Willy DeVille this is for you and if you don't Know him you have to do something about it."
4,Great Boots!,"These boots look great on, were true to fit, (I got my usual size) and are very comfortable. The only problem I have is that they are a suede finish and are scuffed easily. The first time I wore them they scuffed but it's nothing a little shoe polish can't fix. Overall, I was very impressed with this buy."
4,The second Dead Boys album by another name.,"Allegedly a different mix (the pre-mix) of the Dead Boys' second LP. I suspect a bit of EQ fiddling using some god awful mastering program. It really isn't that different to the original and... given how much copies of that are going for, there is no reason for complaining (unless you work for Sire records). The version of ""Ain't it Fun"" (The old Rocket From song) makes it all worthwhile but, as a whole, the First LP was so good that this one will always look like the poor cousin."
1,Terrible quality,"This video may be of Jackie Chans' original flicks, but the quality is as if my son recorded it with a video camera. Would have been better had it been remastered."
1,Jackie Chan - The action Pack - 4 full length feature films,If you can understand Chinese then this tape would be good for you. There is no way to change the language to English also Jackie Chan plays a villian with a big black mole on his face in one of the feature films and I couldn't accept that concept of him at all.
5,loving the small historical atlas,"This is a handy, well bound atlas with marvelous maps and text which is relevant and interesting. It is not only a reference but a book to browse I have had one for years , a delightful read, and bought this one for a gift great gift."
4,Count the ways you love me.....,"Wow. The story is nicely done. I couldn't stop reading from the beginning to the arrest. The characters seemed so real because I've gotten to know them through Raina's other books. Her style makes each book a comfortable read. I just returned from vacation and finished 2 books by Harris. I'm looking for my third by her. if you like a story that includes murder and romance, pick up a harris book."
2,Didn't get far on this one,"I tried reading this book a couple of times, but found the text to be awkward and stilted. Characters are introduced with no background or description. Left me cold."
4,"Attractive, but not art.","My family and I enjoyed putting this puzzle together.It's a very attractive scene, but I was a little disappointed that the artist apparently hacked this image together using photoshop. It's hard to tell from the Amazon image, but when looking at the actual puzzle, you can tell that many of the animals and flowers are the same image, flipped, rotated, or resized.Other than that, it's a perfectly good jigsaw puzzle."
5,Very Fast Service,"This is not the first time I ordered this product. Each time, I get what I ordered and usually within one to two days from ordering. Extremely pleased."
4,Leftovers Make for Yet Another Good Album,"""Wooden Head"" was released by the Turtles in 1970, so one would think that it contained the style of pop rock that the group played in the latter part of their career, but the album largely consists of folk rock songs from several years earlier that were never released. Not every song here is great, but all in all, the album holds up well--my favorites were ""Tie Me Down"" and the mesmerizing ""She'll Come Back."" It is the mark of a great group when, at career's end, the band has enough unreleased material to put out another pretty good album on its way out the door."
3,Little Wooden Head,"This album is a thrown together collection of left over songs released after the Turtles broke up. Some good songs, and some not so good songs. There are songs here from the band's early recording sessions and it's latter recording sessions. It makes for a very schizophrenic listening experience. For diehard Turtles fans only."
5,Ultimate Waylon Jennings,"Love, love love this CD! Cannot get enough of Waylon... wish he was still writing and sing songs! Great CD!!"
5,waylon,I have not listened to this cd as it is a xmas present for my husband. It looks like a good cd and appears to be in good shape. thank you.
5,Junk Bonds!!!,"Ever heard of junk bonds? How bout junkie Bonds??? Any way you look at it, this guy is a joke! You never pulled the wool over my eyes, Barry! I hope you've taken many years off of your pathetic life while shooting up...you are disgusting!!!"
1,Tainted book - beware when reading!,"This book uses circumstantial evidence to incriminate and conclude that Barry Bonds took steroids, and that this cheating has been the sole reason for all his homeruns since 'allegedly' taking steroids. The book would lead you to believe that all of this has been proven in a court of law, and Barry Bonds is the worst and most dishonest athlete ever to have walked to planet. However, not only is the book poorly written, it mixes fact with fiction, and leads one to believe that there is a race issue underlying the Bonds incrimination.More important issues which are not addressed in the book include: would steroid use really help him hit more home runs? Does more muscle equal more distance on a flying baseball? What is the chance that he did not actually use steroids - if you really want something to be true you can throw together all the circumstantial evidence you want, but that doesn't mean it is so."
2,Dragged,"Seemed to drag on and on. It was an easy read, and parts of it were interesting, but if felt at times that certain chapters repeated. The story could have been told just as effectively in half as many pages."
4,Baseball's Shame,"It's a great read despite a plethora of typos but something was lacking, though I can't quite pin it down. They nail Balco to the wall and lead one to ask why Major League Baseball never bothered to investigate the real reasons behind the slugging of the 90s, as if we don't know the answer. Thanks a lot Bud. Should be no question that this is the worst scandal since 1919. Thanks again Bud. Interesting to note that when the indictments came down, no players were mentioned, so thank goodness for real reporting."
1,Who cares?,"This book must have been written with baseball players in mind, because the ones soon to be arrested and imprisoned for using dope will be the only people with so little else to do with their lives that they will want to read every word of this. It's a dull, disappointing book about dull, disappointing athletes."
1,Fraud?,"I have not read the book, but if it was just released yesterday 3/23, how are all these reviews already up? Fast readers, must be. Bought from Amazon.com? Impossible! So what is the motivation here, and can we really believe the legitimacy of these reviews?"
2,Not what it's purported to be,"The book is ok, but I was disappointed. I was hoping for something specific to Barry Bonds and allegations of steroid use. ""Game of Shadows"" is really more about BALCO, Victor Conte, Gre Anderson, and the use of steroids in professional sports. Barry Bonds is one part of the story (and certainly the part that sells books), but much of the book focuses on track and field athletes and on individuals and entities that are peripheral to Barry Bonds."
5,One of the BEST books i have read,"This book is crazy, i have never paid attention to baseball and its players, but now i understand why! I have watched Bonds in action and thought he was one of the best, but reading this book changed my mind. I think people should read this book please and understand the man and where he is comming from."
2,Rehash of Public Information - Just read SI,"If you're looking for something new on Barry Bonds, skip this book. The Sports Illustrated excerpt has just about everything in it already. Bonds takes up may 1/3 of the book. The rest is focused on Victor (yawn) Conte, Greg Anderson, and the track & field olympians.Some of the chapters repeat incidents earlier mentioned. There are no smoking guns. You already heard what Bonds' ex-girlfriend said, and there's nothing more in the book about her. The ""leaked"" testimony... if you followed the story, you already know it. Bonds admitted nothing, Giambi did, Sheffield blamed Bonds.There is virtually no first-hand investigative reporting in this book."
1,WHAT A JOKE,"Clearly some fact checking needs to be done. On several occasions the authors either blatantly fabricate details or mix and match to suit their needs - anyone who wants to really check into this can pull up any and all of the legal documents. Bonds' case against these jokers will be settled pretty quickly so for all of you looking to make a purchase, know that when you do the money is going to end up right in Barry's pocket! Love him or hate (or be indiiferent such as myself), but don't waste your time or cash."
3,Just not the way I learned them.,"I was disappointed because the songs/words weredifferent than the way I learned them. Also, I(mistakenly) thought the Thumbelina song would beon there with the fairytale, and it wasn't."
4,"Very good version of ""The Kid"" for modern times","I managed to see this film on PBS over 20 years ago. I can assess it's quality by the fact that it's stayed with me all these years. Although it's derivative of Chaplin'sThe Kid, Charles Lane definitely delivers the goods as the film is funny, charming, poignant, imaginative, and socially aware (in this regard it even trumps Chaplin). This is an important film that absolutely needs to be available so audiences can appreciate it. I rate it 4.5 (out of 5)."
2,Cheap and not built to last,"I liked the price and bought this. It really never operated to my satisfaction. WIthin a few weeks the dial to power it up and adjust its sensitivity just completely snapped off. The dial could never be put back in place and this 'supposedly' professional tool is now only useful in amusing my toddlers. If you're a professional electrician, get a voltage detector from a company that manufactures professional quality."
2,Not the Best Voltage Detector,"The price was right! However, this product has a turn dial for sensitivity. When putting it into the tool belt and taking it out, the little dial to turn the device on or off broke up. So I went out and bought and Klein voltage detector which is much sleeker and obviously a great brand and good products. Matthewstools.com"
1,Noisy Right Out of the Box,"I just received this cable yesterday. I was real hyped to check it out. I plugged it in and there was nothing but hissing and buzzing. I grabbed my sons Monster Cable and switched it out. The Monster was ultra quiet, not one bit of noise. I returned the cable for a refund. I guess it is usually better to spend a few more $$ and get something with quality."
1,Inexcusably poor build quality,"You get what you pay for, but I paid enough to get better than this.I plugged the cable in to a monitor and all was well. I unplugged it, moved the monitor, plugged it back in and ... nothing.After removing the connector, I discovered the the barely 1/16"" of stripped wire had broken off the practically nonexistent soldered connection. This cable had ZERO chance of surviving on stage for more than five minutes.I'll solder it properly myself, but I shouldn't have to. Go elsewhere if you're planning on using this anywhere that the cable might be subjected to minor jostling or being unplugged multiple times (i.e. go elsewhere)."
4,"1/4""-to-1/4"" 12 ga speaker cable","I needed a speaker cable capable of handling 625 watts rms for my new bass guitar cabinet. Wanted 12 ga cable, and this is what it is. Actually attached a speakon connector to one end after removing the 1/4"" plug. Connectors are not Neutriks or G&H, but of reasonably high quality and of good size. Cable is generic, but again, of decent quality. Great price for a very good assembled speaker cable."
1,Cables are Chinese junk,"Purchased 2 of these cables and using them to hook up electric guitar to amplifier. One worked and the other was creating static and feed back. Returned the faulty cable for exchange. The other cable then started creating static and feed back. The replacement arrived and the same problem persisted. Returned all 3 cable for refund. Appears to be a cheap metal used for the 1/4 "" male plugs. Made in China and in my opinion are junk."
1,Do not buy Pyle (of junk) Cables!,"I bought 2 Pyle speaker cables a few years ago and one of them didn't work right out of the packaging. The other one wasn't grounded properly and had a hum to it that never cleared up. Fast forward a few years later and I buy 4 of these for a friend on a budget - I told him my experience, but he insisted. Guess what? 2 of the 4 didn't work right out of the bag and 1 of them had a hum and the other one worked fine. So if you want 1 out of 6 cables to work for you, then be sure and buy Pyle of JUNK cables!"
4,ext speaker,"I'm using this cable for another speaker off my fender comboacroos the room. Wasn't sure if I wanted another speaker so far away,glad I tried it. This cable seems fine although I may switch to a monster later on. Cheapest price on 12 gauge and still a usable short length. Ilooked on M.F. z sound G.C. and definately the cheapest. Not the best or even mid I'm sure but better quality than say live wire. It definately meets the need and chunky ol'12 guage for cheap is nice."
5,Completely sturdy & reliable,"What else can I say? The shielding is super thick and not even close to impressionable from a poor wrap up job. The heads are also super thick and well soldered. The signal is clean. What more do you want from a cable? Oh, maybe tie-dye colored shielding. That's what it needs."
5,A Wilhelm Scream rock!!,"These guys are really talented and can only go onto bigger and better things, much like ex-label mates AFI appear to be doing.This album has some real gems on it for people who like punks that can play their instruments."
4,Sometimes Less Is More,"There is a lot of good stuff on this set and the booklet is great. That said, I knocked off one star because I was a little disappointed with this when compared to the Robert Nighthawk cuts that form his ""Live On Maxwell St.-1964"" CD. That one is an absolute masterpiece. This one is not nearly as consistant. Sometimes less IS more."
5,Diet Pasta,"If your on a diet eat this pasta it won't spike your insulin intake to high.Taste Great, east this to stay healthy.-T-"
3,Just OK,"Well I enjoyed this movie to a certain degree. It is Asylum, so I went in with low expectations. They usually work with a very low budget so if you just accept this for what it is; a micro-budget sci-fi found footage alien flick... you may enjoy it. Worth at least a rental."
2,Not really worth it,"i can appreciate what this movie is aimed at doing, but it never got there... the movie is 90% running through the jungle while everyone rambles on incoherently... fireworks for explosions... ugh."
3,An old Buck Owens fan,"After listening to this cd I've come to two conclusions. As an old fan of Buck Owens since 1963 When I first heard ""Act Naturally"" I was sold. I really like the songs on this cd, but my only disappointment was in the final mix in the songs. Most songs don't have enough bass but the last cut ""Foolin' Round"" the instrumental version is way too bassy. The vocals are very good and so is the instrumentation. There's quite a few songs on this cd that I've never heard but I sure did enjoy them. Through the years I've accumulated alot of albums by Buck Owens and the Buckaroos. I'm looking forward to buying more cd'c of Buck to replace my old scratchy albums. Other than the mix this cd is well worth getting for hard core country music lovers. Guitar Bob"
5,Just sit back and relax,"Here is proof positive of the ability of Buck Owens to be able to take someone else's song and make it his own.The songs in this CD were done,and done well,by other artists.Then Buck and the Buckaroos come along and you begin to wonder if these songs should have been theirs all along.I'm a sucker for steel guitar and this CD is loaded with it.Truely a must have for Buck Owens fans and for anyone who loves pure country sound without all the hype."
2,Needs a remix,Superior collection of Harlan Howard songs done in Buck's Bakersfield style. The bad news is the awful mix. No bass at all and barely any midrange. For collectors only !
5,Back To Form!,"This is Hypocrisy going back to there orgional sound.Warpath is an awesome track. It's quite long and the tempo shifts a lot through the song. You think it will end then another good Chorus comes Around. Like Entombed's Left hand path but better.The album carries on at a similar Pace & is quite consistent.This is not 5* piece of music overall, but for a death metal a genre I think is really hard to get right. Tagtrem pulls it off perfectly in a few tracks.Think Hypocrisy trick is to have enough melody and structure to make the sound hold together yet still be heavy. And pitching the growling at the same level as the guitars. Usually the power chords carry the song not the vocal. Awesome sound when it works!"
4,Thoughtfully written,"A very honest study of Honor Moore's grandmother Margarett Sargent. I was impressed by the amount of research that went into painting a portrait of a complex and intelligent woman and artist. A certain amount of sympathy is felt for Margarett, yet she was a proud independent woman whose strength inspires. For me, Margarett's life transcended the label of ""wealthy society woman."" She had great talent that she put to use. With all the advances in anti-depressives and the treatment of bi-polar illness one wonders if the mental illness that helped suck her into a vacuum of loss would have been able to do so in this decade. In the end, her loss became our loss. Honor Moore did a great thing by keeping her grandmother's memory alive so that we could revisit her colorful art and life. A great read"
5,essential book for kids,"The illustrations for this book are amazing-- rich, mosiac-like, like paintings by Klimt. My favorite of all my son's books."
3,"Not A Must-Have, But a Lot of Fun","Some great tunes in here, with some interesting Beach Boys chatter. Basically a companion to the Good Vibrations box set. Not sure how many times I'll listen to this one, but it's great fun when you're stuck in traffic."
4,Nice collection of music,I found this 2 cd set very interesting in that it gives alternate versions of songs with and without vocals. Sound quality is very good and I recommend it.
2,Release SMiLE already...,"What is wrong with Capitol? Release SMiLE already! It's all available on the internet. Use the Smile Research Labs version and you've almost got it. Add on the water chant intro to ""I love to say DaDa"", tack on the fuzz guitar ending to ""Mrs. O'leary's Cow"", add ""He gives Speeches"" before ""Wonderful"" in the running order and you got yourself a Masterpiece! As a bonus, include the brian piano solo version of ""Surf's Up"" with instrumental intro. What's the hold up? It could all fit onto one cd. Forget paying someone to write an essay. Just put it out. The cover art's been done for 35 years. I'm tired of waiting."
5,Hawthorne Ca: The Birth of a Musical Legacy,"This is just the best thing that Capitol have brought out since Endless Harmony. In Fact it even includes quotes from the documentry. Some of my favourite things from this album is the fact that I have finally got to listen to the stereo version of Salt Lake City. The Little Girl I Once Knew's backing track is just one of the best pieces of music I have ever heard in my whole life. Truly Brian Wilson work. Another positive point is the fact that they include Surfin's USA's backing track, Good to My baby's backing track and it includes Let The Wind Blow, one of my favourites and Cotten Fields. They couldn't have done any better then this!"
5,"Tastes really good, highest canned smoked herring rating! Good for the bones!","Pleasantly surprised. It is canned herring. It is the best canned herring, just perfect. A bit surprised it was 'mfg' in CANADA, though. Why not Maine, as portrayed?looking forward to the next can.Mike"
2,Too pricey!,"Although the food is good and I completely enjoy consuming the product, it is way too pricey! I believe they should reconsider how much they charge for this especially since they're selling it in bulk"
2,Very disappointed,"After reading the rave reviews, I was very disappointed. The kippers were broken into pieces, overly salty. I would not recommend them."
4,Near perfection product for storing photos.,"Good price and quality. I would prefer the opening for the pictures to be at the right side rather than the top but it works with a little more effort since I don't try to ""mount"" several pictures on the page. Mostly I use 2 @ 4x6 or full page photos."
5,The case for Switzerland and the Swiss franc,"Investing in Swiss francs is, simply stated, the best road to international diversification. The turbulence in global equity markets does not alter the case for investing in safe, fixed-income instruments abroad. In fact, it underlines the importance of having Swiss franc denominated annuities in an investment portfolio -- an investment which Adam Starchild describes in great detail in Swiss Money Secrets. If your tolerance for Wall Street's volatility is running out or if you wish to fortify your portfolio against a worldwide crash, you would be well-advised to look into these crash-proof investments."
5,Solid currency with tax deferral for Americans & many others,"One very important benefit of using an annuity for strategic financial planning is tax related. An annuity permits tax deferrals on the investor's savings which translates into assets growing faster than would be the case if another investment vehicle were to be used. As stated earlier, annuities are used for a variety of financial planning objectives, but they are most often thought of in terms of retirement planning."
5,"For once, something that works","In many years of buying investment books, this was one of the few that gave me something I could really do, and that worked as it was supposed to."
4,"Great info, but laws changed in 2009","This book is a powerhouse of great info. Unfortunately the laws and most of the info regarding Swiss banking changed in 2009. There is still good information to be gleaned from this book, and if nothing else shows the power and intimidation that the IMF and World Bank carries over sovereign nations with fully backed gold currency."
3,Good Playing But Ho-Hum Songwriting,"This is no doubt the best of the two studio records that Janes Addiction made. Perry Farrell's keening vocals and Dave Navarro's fluid guitar playing never sounded better. While the playing is great, the songwriting cannot, unfortunately match the playing. Some of the tracks are awful to say the least. The best tracks on the album, ""Ocean Size,"" ""Had A Dad,"" ""Mountain Song,"" and ""Jane Says"" are all great tunes that the band played for years before making a record. The songs that were introduced on this record, such as ""Summertime Rolls,"" ""Standing In The Shower..."" etc. are long, drawn out indulgences that are almost moronic, lyrically speaking. This album gets an ""A"" for playing but an ""F"" for songwriting. Perry may be a great vocalist at times but a timeless tunesmith he's not!"
2,Shockingly bland,"There's nothing all that great on this record, except for perhaps ""Jane Says,"" which is a classic song for all time. Otherwise, I find these tunes kind of dull and screechy, due to Jane's voice.Their one in 1990 was better, but what do I really know?"
3,Remaster???,"If you do not have this CD, it's an incredible release, so you would do good in picking this up. I had heard that this was a new transfer from the master tapes, thus I picked this up to replace my well played original master CD. I must be honest that I cannot tell much of a difference between this an the original release. I'm an audiophile snob and have over 80K invested in my sound system, yet can't tell a difference between this an the original release. For most people I do not see a reason to invest in this ""Gold"" disc if you already have the original CD release."
5,"A classic, seminal work","This is the band's best disc. I disagree strongly with the Amazon review that believes the best Jane's songs are on ""Ritual..."" While that disc is great in its own time and space, ""Nothing's Shocking"" is on a different plane altogether. This band was starving in every way at that time, and this disc captures that hunger. IMHO, there isn't a less-than-great song (save for the throw away ""thank you ,boys"")here. ""Summertime Rolls"" is a forgotten classic, a tune that I'm sure every purist loves. The raw intensity, creativity, rockmanship, and independence would never again be reached by this band. They were at their paramount here, the height of their powers. If it was the only thing they'd ever done, they would be one of rock's greatest bands. Fortunately for them, they also did ""Ritual..."", which cements forever them in rock royalty."
5,A Must Have Fix,"This is a CD that gets under your skin. I find that when I don't hear Ocean Size or Summertime Rolls for a while I get shaky and begin to mumble. Given that my Keith Richards and Perry Farrell impersonations fall short to anything other than foolish, I pop this CD on and ride the wave of satisfaction.This is one of the truest and best albums ever recorded, don't believe me? The first listen is free, friend. Just know that once you've had a taste of this cerebral manifesto to life ocean side, you'll be hooked like the rest of us."
5,80's music,"Two bands from the late 80's were of great importance, one being Jane's Addiction. For comparing which album was best though may be confusing since live bootleg tapes circa '88 were being circulated containing most of their work which was later released.The other band of notoriety was the Pixies. And both delivered incredible performances."
5,Jane Says this is one Insane Album,"You cna rag all ya want about Jane's Addiction's feminism i.e., kissing each other on stage, and Perry dressing in drag, but Jane's was truly influential. You can hear their influence in Nirvana, Limp Bizkit, KoRn, Rage Against the Machine, and countless other bands. A gothic singer, punk bassist, teenaged metalhead guitarist, and an African-influenced drummer painted this masterpiece of music, truly, entertainment itself. It showed how to brew together the clashing personalities of the members to a unified whole. Nothing's Shocking was a perfect bridge from Guns N' Roses to Nirvana."
1,wasted addiction,"Absolute mindless tosh, stick to Iggy pop , this is a waste of plastic and oxygen on the part of the artists."
4,Ocean Sized,"This isn't Jane's greatest album but it's probably their most ""alternative"". I would have given the album 5 stars with songs like ""Had a dad"" (one I'm sure we all take to personally),""Up the beach"",""Ocean Size"",""Standing in the shower...thinking""(if you don't get that you shouldn't even be listening to Jane's),""Ted,just admit it..."",and everything else but ""Idiot's rule"". Which brings me to this. I love everything Jane's Addiction does even if it annoys me. I understand ""Idiots rule"" and what they are saying but I just can't stand it. That's why Jane's is such a great band. Because they don't care if there's something you don't like about what they do because they do it for themselves and for what they are trying to say."
5,Jane's Best,"This is Jane's Addiction's best CD, and the one to start with if you don't own any of their stuff. The songwriting rocks hard and is better than ""Ritual"". ""Ritual"" has 3 of Jane's Best songs on it, but as an album it doesn't work as well as ""Nothing's Shocking""."
4,My addiction to Jane's Addiction,"I like Porno for Pyros. I love Jane's Addiction. Nothing can beat the pure adrenalin rush you get from listening to a jane's CD. Mountain Song has to be one of my all time favourite songs, its blistering pace and its rythmic beauty in itself makes 'Nothing's Shocking' a must have for any self respecting music collection. The pace is slowed down for 'Jane Says' with Farell's identifying beach sound, it always reminds me of long, summer evenings (well I can dream...). Standing in the Shower Thinking is pure brilliance and I always get an irrisistable urge to dance when it is on. Some people have argued that Ritual... is a better album but in my opinion 'Nothing's Shocking' offers a more diverse range of songs and therefore makes for more exciting listening."
4,what does JANE say?,Nothing's Shocking is a mixture of hard pumping guitar jams with melodic vocals by Perry Farrell. His voice combined with the music is sublime beauty. Jane Says even uses a steel drum to add extra rythm. This band was definetly important in the evolution of Los Angeles's music community and was one of LA's most popular rock acts during their years together.
1,lost gem?,"if you enjoy listening to a cover of Everybody's Talkin' done with a farfisa organ, tamborine, and cheesy horns, and consider that psychedelia, then this is a must have. other than that, this is a subpar sixties group that couldn't score a musical hit on the pop charts. 15 songs in the pop vein. about 10% (or less) actually sound psychedelic. i define psychedelia with, to name a few bands: early airplane, early floyd, early zappa, hp lovecraft (especially II), mandrake memorial and some fever tree. this doesn't come close to those musical stylings. this is more garage band than psychedelic music. i don't know why people think just because someone release a record in the sixties, that it is a lost classic or psychedelic. needless to say i think previous reviewers have been much too kind to this over rated release. if you want it, there are plenty of used copies to go around."
4,Quick & Easy,"Quick and east to put up, only takes a couple minutes. A great way to display a child's toys with out crowding space."
5,At Lat,Finally a computer manual written by a human. And one a human can understand. I gave up on trying to understand the computer manuels. This one shows you how to actually do real world situations. A reference guide I constantly go back to. Anderson Humphreys
5,Best I've found!,This is the best program I've found for a beginner at learning the compexities of CorelDraw 12. Simple easy to follow demos that you can use while working in CorelDraw
1,Amateurish at best,"Don't be fooled by the reviews you read here. They're completely wrong -- it looks like the author wrote them! The content of this ebook is difficult to read, badly written, and poorly illustrated. The structure is unorganized and the author obviously has no professional design or illustration skills training. Absolutely terrible stuff.I strongly recommend the CorelDRAW Official Guide instead - it's the complete opposite."
2,Not as Good,"While this book does lay out some fundamental rules needed for an at home behavior system, I prefer the one described at [...] in that it is more fun and creative."
3,"Good bedtime reading, but not necessarily for specialists","This book tried to fulfill an almost impossible task; to summarize the history of Hollywood in one volume through a series of encyclopedia entries. Much of the information is fairly familiar to historians, but there are some quirky entries - for example, on the forgotten director Allan Dwan. As a reference book, its use might be limited; but as bedtime reading, it is an ideal text. Readers can dip into it at will, and be assured of reading a series of concise, well-written entries. Perhaps the bibliography might have been a little more comprehensive, but nonetheless it's a worthwhile text."
3,Three-a-day better than one-a-day,"The three stars is because vitamins/minerals should be taken three times a day, not once, to keep them in the bloodstream. I bought this for someone who uses it all the time."
2,It does hurt...,"I searched out reviews before buying last summer and found good reviews, with only a few negatives, so I bought a supply for 6 months (I live out of the country 9 months of the year) - only to find that each time I took it, I could expect severe nausea (if I'd eaten little), or stomach pain if I'd had a meal. I continued to take it for 3 months, thinking I'd get used to it, or find the right combination, but it never happened. I still think it's a good product, but not for everyone. If you've never taken it - get a sample size bottle and try it first. I ended up giving away 2 full unopened bottles because it just wasn't worth the pain for me."
1,Pain,I use to take the normal Centrum for years - never a problem.. I am throwing my silver bottle out after about 2 months - mild to heavy stomach pain after every pill - not matter if i take with food or without- very disappointment to read of all the problems
2,I was so confused.,"I placed order one bottle contained 285 tablets. But you sent me three bottles of centrum, each contains 100 tablets.It made me dubious about its quality."
1,not the same as the description,"i ordered 1 bottle of 285 tablets but i received 3 bottles of 110, it does not have expiration data. I NEED TO KNOW WHICH IS THE EXPIRATION DATA."
5,Great Vitamins,I've stocked my husband and his best friends cupboard with these vitamins. They're top shelf and you get alot for the money.
5,awesome!,"This is one of the best cd's i've ever heard. justifide takes christian rock to a completely new level with this. they are great at hard rock and when they slow it down a little, too. the lead singer's voice is great, and the guitar players are extremely talented. Get this cd if you like christian rock or even if you think you don't"
5,Absolutly Awesome,"I picked up this CD at one of the prerelease shows and it's been in my CD player ever since then. The lyrics are brilliantly written about issues the younger generation faces in today's world. The song ""9 out of 10"" talks about overcoming the powers of lust, while ""Change"" is a cry for reform by teens of society. By far, my favorite song is ""Still Cries."" It expresses the emotion of a teen left by her boyfriend when she finds out she's pregnant. ""Sweet New found Joy"" has a whole different feel, a sort of reggae, laid back sound. These guys are going to make it big, and they so deserve it. Not only are they incredible musicians, but they are three of the sweetest guys anyone could ever imagine."
5,Awesome addition to my kitchen!,"I love this device! It works great on low heat and I've smoked tofu, bean curd, golden chanterelles, lots of other veggies & mushrooms. I can't recommend it more highly. be sure to capture the juice that goes into the tray - freeze it and add it to other dishes - it's like veggie stock with liquid smoke."
4,very good smoker,"just recently used the smoker and it was great. the cook time was definitely longer than what the instructions said, had to almost double the time. something that could definitely be improved though is to provide a compartment or space for the wood chips. had to put it under the drip tray, which stayed lopsided because of the wood chips under it. besides that this little baby has definitely become a great addition to our kitchen."
2,Didn't love it,"I was disappointed in watching this. Can't really explain why, just didn't like or enjoy it. I was stuck on an airplane so I finished it just because I had no where else I could go."
3,Almost great,"Overall, this replacement has worked ok, but has some issues. This exhaust pipe arrived with stickers and tape all over it which had to be removed for me to put the hi-temp paint on it. Not the manufacturer's fault though, it was shipped by itself, so that's where they had to stick it.As for fit, the pipe fit well except for one spot about two thirds down the pipe. The pipe is permanently wedged onto the heat shield. So now my car has a little extra vibration when in park because the pipe resonates with the heat shield. For the most part though, not a big deal."
4,West Coast Country from 1963,In the mid 1950's Buck was an unknown singer who landed work playing guitar on recording sessions for artists at Capitol records. One of those artists was Tommy Collins who had a string of hits back then. This album was a tribute to a friend and mentor. It contains no hits but is well worth the listen. Many of these songs are full of humor and heartache. The perfect blend for a great country album. Sounds great on CD!!!!
3,Stopped working,"I bought this watch for my son for Christmas 2009. He LOVED IT!! He had been look for a watch and I remember that my Dad had given me an Omega when I was young. I still have it. I was looking a similar Heirloom type timepiece for my son. I was wonderful until 2 weeks after the return window ran out. That was barely a month after he started wearing it. It no longer keeps time and now the crystal is cracked. I am about to start the return procedure if I can, but the warranty on this product basically excludes everything but an act of God.I gave it 3 stars for looks and marketing alone. So far the hype has yet to live up to reality. If you are looking for a watch stay away from this one until Amazon can clear up some of the backlog of dissatisfied customers. I still think the watch is nice, but if my son can't have it for the next 30 years, then it is really not what I thought it would be."
3,"Keeps great time, but Quality Issues (UPDATE)","Great looking watch, keeps time accurately (very). I expected less in the timekeeping department. Gorgeous, would make a wonderful gift.One issue, my unit needs to be replaced. When I attempted to change the time for daylight savings, the crown came out with the stem attached! I carefully wiggled it back in, and now need to process the return. I would be absolutely comfortable purchasing another, and may do so in the future.UPDATE: Now I can't set the time at all, I've had trouble finding the contact to exchange or warranty the watch. By far the most complemented watch I own, the most stylish, and the most problematic. If anyone knows how to get this thing fixed, please post!"
4,"Handsome and flawed, like you.","The watch is eye candy, a piece of jewelry, artwork with intricacy and engaging rhythmic movement. The only time I've worn it without people stopping me to ask about it, the watch was mostly obscured by the sleeve of a sports coat. The readability isn't so great - little contrast between the hands and the face of the watch. Don't try to pull out the crown to set the time without unscrewing it a bit first. With those cautions, I highly recommend the watch."
4,Looks cool,the watch finally arrived and Amazon lowered the price $10!!there is mistake on watch description. the amazon says the watch band width is 20mm. so i bought 20mm watch band. and it was too loose. so i checked the Stuhrling website. and the real watch band width is 22mm!! man..
2,Poor Quality,Bought this watch and within 2 months the glass fell out. The band wore out quickly. Made in china. won't mess with this brand again...
3,Ok from a distance,"This watch looks great from a distance. Up close the casting on the rear and numbers look poor and rough. Colour is slightly off on this casted parts as well, compared to the external and moving parts.Easily scratched as well.Overall, the gripes are small and I still like this watch."
1,Poor Stuhrling customer service for broken watch,"My Stuhrling watch lasted 6 weeks and was worn 5 times before the minute hand fell off - watch was not bumped or dropped. I contacted Stuhrling's repair and was told that I had to ship it back at my own expense and they would ""kindly waive"" the normal $20 handling/return fee since the watch was nearly new, with no guarantee as to how fast the turnaround would be. No mention of the $20 fee under their warrantee info on Amazon. Thank god for Amazon's stellar service since they replaced the watch with new (too late for refund by two weeks)and will handle Stuhrling directly. Poor Stuhrling customer service for broken watch"
3,Dented cans,"The formula itself is of good quality and a great price. However, the cans are usually quite dented, sometimes to the point that I am unable to use an electric can opener to take the lid off."
1,"Great product, poor shipping!","While I have no complaints about the product itself, 2 out of 3 orders arrived damaged, with dented cans. Amazon did however refund me for the damaged cans. I would only order this through Amazon as a last resort."
1,bad won't let you get on,Ya no matter how you answer the question it won't let you on to the program
4,Great for the chemistry and molecular biology major.,"This organic chemistry textbook is great for the real hard core chemistry major and those people in the the fields of biochemistry, imunology, genetics and biophysics. The book assumes that the student has a good foundation in basic chemistry and that he/she is willing to learn material beyond the basic topic. The book has the best practice problems of any basic organic textbook."
2,In Beauty May She Walk,I've read 4 books on hiking the AT. This one I liked the least. Author complained a lot about how difficult it was. Left me almost depressed about the prospect of hiking the trail.
5,insperation for those of us over sixty,"A wonderful book for those of us over sixty. It is an insperation, very detailed. A fun book."
3,Truth pressed to earth will rise again,"Barbara Reynolds caught hell when she published this book. It was the first to expose several ""facts"" about the Jesse Jackson myth as false. The assasination story, the growing up in a shack story, the curious finances of Operation Breadbasket and Jackson's personal life were all exposed. Reynolds eventually had to leave Chicago and the book although widely read was rarely mentioned in public. Today Keith Timmerman's book Shakedown is on the bestseller lists. It turns out that Barbara was right all along."
4,Great CD!,"Catie Curtis is a wonderfully talented vocalist, songwriter and musician. Her songs speak from the heart, with wonderfully poignant lyrics and beautiful melodies. I loved every song on this album!"
3,Pleasant arrangements,"I had not heard this artist before, but I bought this after listening to some samples. What strikes me about Catie is that her voice sounds almost identical to that of Edie Brickell. Many of the arrangements on ""My Shirt Looks Good On You"" are similar to ""Ghost of a Dog"" by Edie Brickell and the New Bohemians. The material is not quite on the same level as ""Ghost"", however. A few songs are quite nice (including the opening piece ""Run""). Most of the rest of the first half are somewhat sophomoric and banal (especially the title track ""My Shirt Looks Good On You"", which is almost embarrassing) but pleasant enough. The album picks up steam again, though, about track 9, ""Elizabeth"", and finishes strong.Recommended, with reservations"
2,"Oh where, oh where has my Catie gone","I'm afraid that I must agree with the amazon.com reviewer that the current trajectory of Catie's work is a big disappointment. The edge is gone. The originality is gone. The social consciousness has drifted away into self-absorption. Has success spoiled Catie? Has she been co-opted somehow? Let's hope that it's just a phase or creative rebuilding. In the meantime, if you haven't heard Catie before, look to her first outings, not the latest two CDs. ""My Shirt Looks Good on You"" is, let's face it, boring, despite one good cut in ""Walk Along the Highway."" Even a song co-penned with the riveting Mary Gauthier is not strong. The brilliant Dar Williams is quoted as having said she ""wigged out"" for a while after her first success, but she has emerged stronger than ever, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Catie."
2,why?,"As an avid follower of contemporary folk music I have seen Catie Curtis perform as a supporting act for both Dar Williams and Mary Chapin Carpenter. I fail to understand how such a mediocre artist can command so large a following? I bought ""Crash Course.."" and a less recent album ( I forget its title ) to see if I could learn to appreciate her music. This album is generally as musically banal and lyrically unsubtle as the other two. Sorry."
1,why?,"As an avid follower of contemporary folk music I have seen Catie Curtis perform as a supporting act for both Dar Williams and Mary Chapin Carpenter.

Like this one, they are usually musically banal, their lyrics unsubtle and in-tour-face.Sorry."
4,Another Great From Catie,"Catie Curtis has created another very soulful and moving album with her newest. Very much like 'Crash Course in Roses,' this album combines her very powerful voice with her quiet guitar rythyms. Some of the songs are more open than previous works ('Jane' and 'Elizabeth') while others capture that love of the country that she finds herself traveling. Her music has turned from a very heavy folk twang to more of a storyteller to music. This is by far one of her best albums to date."
5,A wonderful adventure,If you are all about the lyrics and simply want the music to fit the words and be a little unexpected - get this and have a good time.
1,I returned it for my money back.,"This machine just doesn't work. Basically, I have nothing to add to the criticisms already in other reviews. Just as noted in other reviews, it doesn't want to make coffee, it just wants to blink all its lights (not mentioned in the instruction book). When you get it to make coffee, it puts waaaay too much water in the espresso, and the program function to change the amount of water it puts in doesn't change a thing.I sent it back, and I am hoping for a seamless refund to my credit card.I think the point is that you can't get a good espresso machine for such a low price."
1,Worse by the month,"This machine had a lot of promise and was great to begin with. Then with each passing month something went wrong. Slower to steam and now it just gives a squirt before it stops dripping out the coffee. Don't bother with it - too hard to fix, too expensive to return, particularly from Trinidad! Go for low tech, fixable unit, if one is available."
3,Decent espresso Initially,"Overall I'm satisfied with this product. I had a coupon so I got it for a good price. The machine recently clogged up on me, I use it daily. However they give you a little device to help with this also they recommend regular descalings, which I haven't done yet. I had a really basic Krups before that worked fine but I thought a upgrade would be nice. The machine is also quite noisy when making coffee, that surprised me. I hope it lasts as long as my last machine 15 years.I am updating this review. I bought this product based on consumer reports recommending it. However I just read the reviews written by others and I'm also having the same problems of the coffee not flowing. I'm sending it back today after talking to the customer service person who was very nice. I have a feeling I'll be attempting to return it because the 2nd one probably won't work either. It did initially make great espresso."
2,Krups could have done better,"This product performs poorly. Within 1 month of receiving it, water no longer flowed through the coffee. After complaining to Krups, sending it for repairs and finally getting a replacement, I am still not very happy with it. The frothing part is unpredictable in its creation of quality foam. Krups did better with their older model of this machine."
4,Picky machine but it makes good coffee,"This is the first espresso machine I have owned so I have no other product to compare it to. So far I have been happy with my Krups, although I have already had to replace the gasket once. The machine seems to be VERY picky about when it will and will not pull shots. If the espresso is not loaded just right it refuses to pull the shot, which causes water pressure to build up (this is how the gasket broke). Bottom line: the coffee tastes great, however, sometimes making the coffee can be a bit of a hassle."
2,Don't buy,"I have returned this item TWICE. Their tray is not pulling out, so you have to -suck- out the water from it. It doesn't hold all types of coffee, sometimes I had water coming out from the sides, or straight into tray. And I suspect that the pressure is not sustainable because I'm getting different results - sometimes coffee is good, sometimes you just can't drink this."
1,Absolute Junk,"This machine worked fine for the first week. After that however, it has been spotty at best. The frother does not work at all. It does not heat the milk properly and makes minimal froth. Even making a cup of espresso has become a crap-shoot. The pre-programmed amounts (single, double shots)give different amounts of water each time and more times than not, I've had to push the button several times to make one cup of espresso. The tray underneath fills with water constantly. I had a Krups machine for 10 years prior to buying this one. I want my old one back. This is garbage. Do not waste you money.P.S. Its noisy and rattles."
1,This machine will break!!,"My husband purchased this espresso machine for me and I was thrilled at first. It worked well for just shy of 2 months, then broke. The water would no longer draw up into the filter it would only drain into the drip tray. We exchanged it for the exact same model and the new one was worse! We followed the instructions to prime it before the first use the night we received it and turned it off without making coffee. Luckily I smelled something funny before going to bed or else my house may have burned down! Internally the machine didn't turn off and it over-heated so badly that it scorched my counter and warped the plastic on the top and sides! The second machine never made a cup of coffee... We promptly returned that one as well and decided to purchase a different machine entirely! Please don't waste your money on this product!"
1,What a mess,"We returned the Krups XP4050 after several attempts to use it. We faithfully followed the directions, priming it three times just using water and we even called the help line. We ended up with hot water spraying everywhere as though the pump wasn't able to force the water up through the machine. It made a lot of noise. When we finally did try it with actual coffee, it was no better. The steamer did not heat the milk, half the water still ended up in the collection space below the carafe, and the steam spewed out all over us. Perhaps we needed lessons but, being that my husband is Italian and a professor of mathematics, we thought we should be able to purchase a product, read the instructions and make it work. We have returned to our little stove top espresso maker used in almost every home in Italy and wonder why we ever thought of spending this kind of money on a yuppie espresso machine in the first place."
1,Worst piece of junk ever manufactured,"Followed every instruction explicitly - machine just makes a ton of noise - water never leaves the tank. Read the trouble shooting, double-checked the tank seating, etc.Had a friend who is a professional chef come over. She owns the same machine. She could never make it work. Makes a tons of noise, water never comes out of the tank.Apparently only about 50% of those made actually work. So if you want to try to buy this thing, you have about a 50% chance of owning a piece of crap for your counter top.Never buying a Krups anything ever again. EVER."
1,never worked,"I ordered one which never worked, the replacement did not work as well. Water does not come through the filter, strange blinking of the lights. Just big frustration. Otherwise look very nice."
1,Dead on Arrival,Machine arrived dead on arrival. None of the water would force its way though the coffee grounds and would go into the overflow. Had to send it back and would not reccommend.
3,Great concert - poor visual clarity,"I enjoyed watching this live concert, what city it was recorded in I am not sure. Most of the material here is taken from the album of the same name recorded in 1991. There is some Police material thrown in for good measure and some of Stings music from his earlier albums. The video is 90 minutes in length. I liked the band that he has together for this concert (David Sancious, Dominic Miller, Vince Calaiuta) although I don't think they can compare with the Police. I don't know if it's the best live concert that Sting has ever recorded but I think it captures the period adequately. The major gripe I have with this video is the picture quality, it was very bright and hard on the eyes. Whether this had something to do with the way it was recorded or the company that edited it, I'm not sure. I think this is a shame but I would still recommend it."
3,Lacklustre,"Recorded during a series of concerts at The Hague in early May 1991, this show is from 10 May and served as a benefit gig for Kurd Aid. The video remains (to date) the only official in-concert video that runs close to being a full length solo-era performance. It isn't a full length performance of course, but remains of interest for that reason. Despite majoring on our favourite album, the performance is a little lacklustre although several of the performances were released as live b-sides on Ten Summoner's Tales era singles. Perhaps of most interest is the live version of Hendrix's Purple Haze, a rip-roaring crowd favourite from that tour. END"
2,poor video production,"Sting and his bandmates are great, the music is great but the picture quality, production and choice of camera angles is not great. As a musician I enjoy watching musicians perform. Unfortunately, each action shot only stays on a given musician for 2 secs or less so you can't really get a feel for what/how they are playing something. I was disappointed and frustrated watching the video."
1,"Stick to Reviewing Plays, Frankie","This wouldn't be a bad book, except that Frank Rich wasn't astute or bright enough to realize that the decline and fall of truth began with a President who shook his finger at the camera and in an angry voice declared ""I did NOT have sex with that woman""...Rich, like other spoiled Liberals, won't dare criticize the guy who thought that fondling bimbos was more important than going after Osama Bin Laden. Or that sending B-52s to bomb Belgrade on regular runs was vital to American National Security more so than sending these B-52s on regular runs to terror camps in Afghanistan.Rich, a good theatre critic, is nonetheless a sorry, ignorant hack when it comes to writing politics - because he spews and spins - and reveals only one-half of what he considers to be the lies in truth. When he has the courage to stick it to Clinton (he wouldn't dare with Hil as a New York Senator), then call me.Otherwise, Frankie, stick to writing theatre or about dysfunctional families."
1,Absolute Propaganda garbage!,"The ""facts"" allegedly cited are anything but.Only the brainwashed amongst the liberal left could ever hope to believe such trype as the author attempts to pass off as ""truth"". I already know the far right will not buy such dribble.I can only wonder with all this BS from the extreme left and right just what happened to such words as ""objectivity"", ""truth"" and ""facts"".The only thing such trash is doing is pushing the country towards a civil war between the left and the right. One in which the weapons will not be words but guns."
1,OMG...,"I actually got a chance to read this. Words truly cannot convey how inaccurate and filled with lies this book is. It's just plain bad...not only that, but Frank Rich is a theatre critic..not a Historian. Need I say more? People, please...save your money!"
3,every little bit helps (I guess!)...,"Bought this for a book club meeting, and I'm glad I got the recording not the book! Never would have slogged through this litany of dirt and scandal had I not been trapped in my car.Poorly organized, wandering back and forth in time and covering and recovering the same incidents -- I guess if I saw the book it might have made more sense; perhaps it had to do with how its organization was conceived. Anyway, there were pearls to pick up, and I did get to find them. But don't call this book ""objective!"" It slung derogatory epithets with the abandon of Rush Limbaugh talking about Hilary!"
3,One can only handle so many anti-Bush books,"G. W. Bush is probably one of the most profiled presidents, with all sorts of critical texts about him, his family, his truthiness, faith, economic policies, military service, etc... This book is one of the more popular ones, partially due to its wit and humor, and partially due to its short length and readability. In my opinion, there are better critiques about Bush than this one. If you want a serious examination of his financial and political connections, try the work by Kevin Philips. For those interested in a tragicomic expose of the lies of his administration, Greg Palast's work is better, along with Maureen Dowd's classic pre-Iraq War. For a good, thoughtful, well-annotated insider's account, the Price of Loyalty is a better source. This book does not offer much that is different, better, or better written than the previously mentioned works. Hence my average rating for it."
5,Best Yet on Iraq and Bush,"I've read one book after another in my effort to understand how America has gone so wrong so fast. This is the best, right up there with Fiasco and One Percent Doctrine. I look forward to Rich's next foray of book length and hope he will attack the most important and as yet unanswered question of this era --- in the face of a cheerleading national press corps, how did the American people nevertheless reject this war and its leaders even before Katrina,etc. had disclosed their utter incompetence, stupidity, and disdain for us all.....in the answer to this question lies the future of all that is decent in our nation....."
5,This Book is Being Freeped!,"There are many one-star reviews here from the foaming-at-the-mouth crowd about a book they have not read. I was forwarded an email asking me to come here and freep (I hold an acct. at freerepublic)- some of these folks are the same people who wrote reviews about their favorite right-wing books and included comments FREAKING! out that the left hasn't even read, say, Ann Coulter. Sad really. Such hate and twisted hypocrisy.Anyway--I really have read this book, and it is very well written. But then I don't consider Bush a true Republican, he is an extremist of another kind, and even people like Joe Scarborough are coming around to see this."
5,Since when is the truth a bad thing?,"As a republican myself, I am amazed at the blind loyalty of these bush supporters. Almost every item in this book has been proven to be true. Unfortunatley most of these people only watch fox for their ""news"" otherwise they might be aware of the truth of this book. I doubt most have even read the book or any other book for that matter. This country is being destroyed by the likes of these people and most are too stupid to realize it or worse they are in on the destruction of our country. Just answer one question if there is a real war on terror why are our borders wide open?"
4,Connecting Many Dots,"All of us who read newspapers and news magazines are aware of some [or much] of what is in Rich's book. What the book provides is a well organized, highly readable 'census' of the Bush administration's propagana. The depth, breadth and success of the effort to manage public opinion and the ineptness or incompetence of the media to do its job is at least as disturbing as the actions of administration.The book gets only 4 stars, not because it isn't quite a good book, because I couldn't bring myself to rate something so depressing any higher. For those who attack the book, its contents or author, you may want to refamilarize yourself with research related to incongruencies/firmly held beliefs and the ability to listen to and hear other points of view."
5,here's a challenge to all the one star reviewers of this book,"This is one of the best and most comprehensive books that I'm familiar with about the deception and incompetence of the Bush Administration and the failure of Congress and the mainstream media to reveal it, and I'm familiar with many.Here's a challenge to the one star reviewers of this book who have actually read it. Instead of bad-mouthing Rich in general terms or bringing up red herring or straw man issues, why don't you quote specific distortions or inaccuracies in the book and tell us what pages they are on? That way, we can check on YOUR veracity as well as Rich's."
2,"Wonderful Title, Mediocre Book",It's a shame that a book about story and spectacle would be so poorly structured and without message. The book has a fantastic title but is otherwise a complete waste. Rich is very endemic of the problem that critics of Bush has - they want to paint him both as a Machiavellian genius and completely incompetent at the same time. The reality is much simpler and more in need of telling - his leadership style created incentives to be dishonest and manipulative and he was incapable of being aware enough to admit their was a problem. It makes for a bad presidency and boring books.
3,Good read - lots of information,"If you are a fan of the Bush administration, you won't want to read this book. Although nothing in the book surprised me, it might raise your hackles if you think 'W' and his cronies are straight shooters...I enjoyed the book, learned some new things, but mostly it was a review of recent history. I was not enamored of Mr. Rich's writing style, however. The book rambles on and seems to suffer somewhat from a lack of organization."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"Having read only 25 pages, I couldn't take it anymore. This book was written to hate on everything America is about. Besides the constant attacks at President Bush in every other sentence, Rich criticizes the troops, our own country, and many other things that will make your spine tingle. It is ridiculous how biased and narrowminded he is; it is almost as if he set out to tear apart a president who was forced to lead our country through several difficult times (and led well, I might add). Rich has absolutely no respect. I can see how liberals would love this completely left-wing book, so go ahead and read if it pleasures you, but for anyone who has common sense and doesn't want to spend hours reading a book that is poorly worded and full of mindless, partisan analysis, I urge to to refrain from coming within 100 yards of this book. And if you do, throw it in the trash. Or better yet, burn it. That's what I'll be doing soon."
1,Standard Obligatory Political Hit Piece,I only read this because I got it for free from a raving lunatic fiend (SP friend) who blames Bush for everthing from global warming to a establishing a conspricy using CIA suicde bombers on 911 to fly planes into the twin towers so he can win reelection in 2004. Our agreement was he would in turn read a copy of Liberal Facism (which was burned with out a second thought). The features the obligatory half truths and contradictions so often associated with these types of political hit pieces and clearly demonstrates to any individual capable of reasoned thought what is wrong with our culture. We are allowing and even encouraging the insane among us to shape our thought and actions. If we listed to garbage like this regardless of ideology we deserve what we get.
1,Too much sarcasm,"Too much sarcasm from start to finish. It's a far-left view of the Bush administration where author Frank Rich seems to be visibly upset at any Republican administration. He uses references to Jon Stewart's, The Daily Show along with Saturday Night Live numerous times to back his opinions on current political events. In my view, an author of his age background and experience should not have written this farcical, liberal montage of jabs at the office of the President of the United States. Better luck next time Frank."
2,Too over the top,"Bush did lie and send us down the wrong path. There is no other way to see it. As a country, we are getting closer and closer to being broke. Hard to believe that we still can't secure our borders but we can spend 1.9 billion dollars a week fighting a ""war"". Makes me sick to think about those who have died in this ""war"". What a waste! When are we going to elect democrats and republicians who are actually competent? Both parties are a nightmare....It is sad that our elected officials are so bad at their jobs....it is going to be the end of us. We must find a way to improve our government."
1,Ho hum...,"Nothing new here. Not a surprise that it just eked out Noam Chomsky on the best seller list...I'm sure Chavez picked up a copy of this tome as well (great minds...etc). Unfortunately for the Frank and his cronies, they keep harping, and Bush's polls keep rising."
2,Hate filled & rehashing what i already knew,"i agree Bush screwed up with Iraq & some other things, but i really already knew that. I do think the author is all wrong in his Katrina analysis, but that's me. Most bi-partision econominist & financial players don't credit presidental policy that much for the direction of the economy. (Well maybe their tax policy makes one feel all warm and comfortable at night depending on your politics.) What comes around goes around. Anyway, i am still waiting for the democratic options & alternatives besides all this Bush psyco-hate? Why is the author so in denial about the world wide radical islamic threat? You know it's alright to losen some legal chains for liberal policies and not for protecting the USA and preventing another or worse 9/11. How about some thoughtful and reasoned anaylsis, argument and less inflamnatory demo-skulduggery, but that does not impress or sell books i suspect."
5,outstanding,"i found frank rich's book, ""the greatest story ever sold"" to be captivating reading. rich details the arguments used in justifying the war in iraq and he discusses some of the marketing techniques, some of the abuses of intelligence, and some of the political blunders. overall, an excellent read. i give it an A- and i highly recommend it for anyone with an interest in how we got into iraq in the first place."
4,Read The Timeline After The Epilogue,"A bit of a polemic, but well worth reading.The 80+ page timeline is a chronological history of what the Bush team KNEW on one side of the page, superbly documented. On the other side of each page, Rich produces what the Bush team SAID. The differences are dramatic. This administration obviously has no respect for the intelligence of the US electorate.How did the Bush team manage to sell its agenda, especially the war, when the lies were so transparent (at least in retrospect)? That is the theme of this book, and Rich suggests the media and Congress have to bear some of the blame.I'm reminded of a book [I didn't read] from the Nixon era. It was called ""The Selling of a President"" and had a Marlboro cigarette pack on the front cover. I guess some things never change."
1,"Skip this ""sale""","Same old, same old. Rich hates Bush and hates America. I'm tired of hearing it and this book provides nothing new, just the same old finger pointing bulliness that has defined the left. I wanted solutions in this book, didn't get them."
3,Rambling on about W,"I have the distinction of hating George Bush more than anyone in the state of Vermont, which is quite a feat. Consequentially, I expected to really like this book. Unfortunately, as you may have guessed from my title, I found it disjointed. What's more, I (I mean, I ) found some of the criticism unfair and unsupported. That said, if you have been terribly guillible or hidden away for the last 6 years, this is a book you need to read. For the rest of us, there is little here that we didn't already know. Sorry , Frank."
3,Really disappointing (alas),"Really disappointing. And I love Frank Rich -- his is the first column I read every Sunday in the NYT. I'd expected a thoughtful dissection of the Administration -- the stories behind his columns. This is not that book. It basically is a chronological narrative that reads like a collection of his columns, and anyone who has read them will recognize that he's recycled a lot of the ideas and sometimes the text as well. I kept waiting for some kind of in-depth, thoughtful analysis beyond the recitation of recycled and already well-covered facts. It never comes. Avoid this book if you're already a Rich fan, but consider it if you've missed his wonderful and penetrating columns."
5,Frank Rich - Hero Journalist,"Frank Rich is my hero. He has smarts, integrity and an incredible memory. His nose is also finely attuned to sniff out the b-s in the politicians of the day."
3,Not As Good As I Thought It Would Be,"I expected a lot more from this book because Frank Rich wrote it. I had seen him on some news programs about current and cultural events and knew he had written for the NY Times. I just wanted it to be more. I felt like it was a laundry list of events without detailed explanation and analysis. I thought Mr. Rich was going to give his take on events and actions, but he chose to just present them in the order that has now been discovered that they happened in. He's looking back on things that happened anywhere from 2 to 7 years ago and I thought he could tell us about the why instead of just the when or how. I would recommend this book to anyone just wanting to see the order that the Bush adminstration did things in and what happened before and after."
5,marketing the white house,"having recently finished rich's book i was surprised at the average rating it had received on amazon. with the reviews divided either 5 stars or 1 it became clear some of the reviews were based more on loyalty to bush than objectivity to the facts. unlike the negative reviews of the rich book, the author presents a solid listing of facts and real events to illustrate the current administration in washington. it is true that rich's book is clearly anti-bush but that might be due more to the performance of bush than the presentation by rich. you can accuse rich of poor manners when he calls bush a ""spoiled brat"" but you cannot argue with his assessment."
4,"Not just about the seller, but the buyer","Missing in most of these reviews is recognition that Rich is not just concerned here with the creation of a fictional case for war to ""create our own reality,"" as a member of the Bush Administration candidly put it, but with the tacit acceptance of the screenplay by the news media. Unfortunately, Rich makes the point far better in his lectures than in this book, which is its main weakness.The Administration fed misinformation to the press, including famously the NY Times, than cited that misinformation to justify its actions. Editors rolled over, the national networks cheered, and what we have is Iraq. Bush did not invent stage management, Rich said in Portland several weeks ago, he and his coterie simply used it more effectively than others before him and with more disastrous results. There is nothing, he said, to prevent the next Administration, Republican or Democrat, from doing exactly the same thing."
5,love it,Thank you Amazon. Black Movie's from the 70's are great. I will order more through Amazon. Can't beat the price. Already have ordered several others.
3,Double Black Exploitation Show,The movies were ok as for as the content but the quality of the picture on both movies was very bad. Needs to be digitized or something.
2,"Product is decent, but definitely a fake","This product is very similar to the original, but very obvious that it's a knock-off. I did not know it was fake when puchasing. They even put it in a Nicole Miller box that was obviously for a different product. Next time, I will make sure to inquiry about authenticity."
4,Insight into life in Paris,"Seeing that Amazon.com can be accessed throughout the entireworld, there are probably many people out there reading this articlenow who have never been to Paris. Although I have never personally lived among a group of people such as those depicted in La Chamade, Francoise Sagan gives us her insight into the lives of the people of Paris at the time that she was writing the novel. Through the eyes of Lucile, a young Parisian woman longing to find happiness, we begin to see a group of Parisians amongst which she spends a lot of her time. At a dinner one night with these friends, she encounters the young Antoine. In an attempt to find true happiness, she pursues a relationship with him, and then eventually learns more about what the true meaning of happiness really is for her. A very good book, and one that anyone from the intermediate-level French student to the native French speaker would benefit from. END"
3,"She's no Britney, Mandy, Jessica, or Christina...but not bad","This CD was definitely not the worst one I've ever listened to (far from it really). Some of the songs were honestly quite catchy and fun. Others seemed unoriginal and kind of weak.If you have listened to the music from ""Cinderella II"" you have heard Brooke's sound. Her voice reminds me a lot of Christina Aguilera for some reason. Too bad she didn't have the production team that helped Christina and all the other pop princesses (Britney is THE BEST) be successful."
2,Considering she might end up with Mikaila and Innosense...,"Well, I have not really listened to this album... BUT...I have heard ""Toodle-oo"" and let me tell you, it's not that original. Virgin Records bought the rights to a song called ""Don't Start Now"" performed by BoA of SMTown Records from Korea. Yes, Korea.Frankly, I think the original version by BoA (only 15 years old but still a better singer than Brooke) is much better. BoA even does an English version, which has the same lyrics as ""Toodle-oo"".And from the samples I've heard, Brooke Allison will end up in the wayward home for pop fallouts sadly."
1,...,"...this Brooke...can't sing and is just a Britney wannabe. Also, that song ""Toodle-oo"" is just a cheap copy of the Japanase/Korean song ""Don't start now"" sung by BoA. Shame on the producers of this entire album."
1,Terrible!,"Do NOT buy this CD. It's really not worth your money. I don't think this girl has what it takes to be a real singer. Besides, her songs and lyrics are just stupid and immature."
1,What's with the lisp?????,"Okay... she may be able to carry a tune in the world of Aaron Carter, but she in no way holds her own against pop power houses like Christina, Britney and N'Sync. She also needs to lose the lisp and pronunciate better. I was almost twitching with every word that came out of her mouth. She needs to wait a few years and develop her skills more. Promising, but definately not ready for the business yet."
1,hilarious!!!!!!!,"brooke allison's album is the funniest i've heard in awhile. i was actually shopping at kmart when the kiss off song came on. imagine my shock when i searched on the internet and found out it's a real song! this is a keeper! great april fool's day gift! this cd is bastard child resulting from what lame over-the-hill executives and 14 yr olds think is cool.waste of talent, a&r, and $$$."
1,This ALBUM SUCKS. Brooke Allison Sucks too.,"I hate this CD. It sucks, she sucks, her voice sucks. Not to mention the ""toodle"" song is BoA's song AND BoA has an english, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese version of it. This girl has no talent with her horrible voice. She tries to sing with attitude but no go, homegirl. Stick with candy hip hop, PLEASE.Waste of money, waste of time, waste of everything. BoA sounds 100000 times better and english isn't even her native language.And that Kiss song is horrible too. Don't waste your money. Go buy the Greatest Hits of Sesasme street, at least Oscar the Grouch has a better voice. You have been warned."
3,"Another Wanna be, better than Mandy Moore","But K-pop singer,BoA's ""Toodle-Oo""(Don't Start Now)version is better than Brooke's."
4,Same Old Formula-but why change a good thing!,"Yet another teen pop princess. Unfortunately no one can come close to being the new Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, and I don't think Brooke Allison is trying to be one but she falls in the same category. The album is very good and if you lie all the other pop princesses you will like Brooke Allison. She has all the right ingredients. Great look, great voice, catchy dance pop tunes, and syrupy ballads. She does have an impressive voice and it shines on ballads like I Miss You and If I Were You. Other standout tracks include The Kiss Off which samples the AOL ""Goodbye"" and I Thought You Might Wanna Know. The best track however is the final ballad Say Goodbye, a beautiful ballad sung flawlessly. Nothing original here but sounds pretty good."
5,Very well done,This is a very well produced and sung pop album. This girl's voice is well beyond her years
1,oookay,"i listened to a 30-second sample of one song. Guess what? She sounded just like Britney Spears. I thought it WAS Britney Spears. Sure, the guys might think she's pretty, the 12-year-old girls might enjoy listening to her, but she is really no different from britney or christina or any of them out there. Just another person thrown into the pop industry...Just <I>once</I>, i'd like to see someone with their own sound...hey wait,that's Pink! But i can't stand listening to her either! Dang it. I give up."
2,Expensive,"It's expensive for what it does. And its expensive for what it is. But it is seemingly the only game in town when using PB6 bellows in combination with a DSLR. KEH seems to offer it for the best price, but call in the order for lowest shipping cost. Did I write that the cord was expensive?"
4,3.5 stars,"its a good album. ""u dont wanna blaze"" is a real standout track...these 2 emcees have some talent but they dont flaunt their lyrical skills as much as they should on this album...they coudl do better...some of tha beats r some real bass thumping songs but but like 2-3 r juz plain old stuff. i recommend this album if yer a rap-a-lot fan. it has its strong points but their raw style may not be for everyone."
5,Can't live without it,"I have had the Super Stuffer every since I first saw one decades ago. No sink with a garbage disposal should be without one--so safe, so convenient. I just can't figure out why they are never available in stores like Bed, Bath, and Beyond, Williams-Sonoma, Etc; nor are they ever advertised. Too bad, because the people who bought my house (I just moved so bought a new Stuffer) had an interest in it, so I left it for them as a house-warming gift! Buy this product; it's great."
2,GOOD CONCEPT POOR EXECUTION,THIS PRODUCT APPEARS TO BE DESIGNED TO USE AS A WASTE PUSHER AND A DRAIN COVER THAT ALLOWS WATER AND SMALLER WASTE TO DRAIN WHILE PROVIDING A SHIELD TO PREVENT SPLASH BACK FROM THE DRAIN WHEN THE DISPOSER IS WORKING.THE PUSHER FUNCTIONS WELL BUT THE DIMENSIONS OF THE UPPER PART OF THE DEVICE DO NOT PERMIT IT TO FIT INTO THE OPENING OF THE INSINKERATOR DISPOSER AS WELL SOME OTHER MOST POPULAR BRANDS OF DISPOSER.A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO MAKING THE DESIGN DIMENSIONS MORE UNIVERSALLY COMPATIBLE.
5,Awesome!,"I've had this for years, and it's still in great shape, and I can't imagine using a garbage disposal without one. Safe, sanitary, and easy to use. You will love it!"
3,"Okay, but not best choice","I've had two of these over the last 2-3 years. At the time, I thought it was great and used it all the time. I kept in in the drain to keep things from falling down the disposer and used it to push food into the disposer. The problem is that the white color constantly got stained. I tried keeping it clean with bleach, but it was too bad to remove. Also, the stuffer is very large and sits well above the level of the drain. If you try to put plates or bowls in the sink, they won't sit level.This time I found another product in black that sits below the level of the drain and it works much better."
3,Good beginner's book.,"Not a great book, but perfect for someone who's just starting out with pet rats. It covers all the basic stuff: caging, how to choose your rats, etc. but thats about it, and it has hardly any information on handling and socializing rats, or much on their health. I wouldn't pass this book up, but you should also consider a more detailed book if you really want the best for your pet rats."
3,A good basic book!,"This book is more from a scientific point of view. I found it very interesting to read about the differences and similarities between wild and pet rats. It also has a good chapter on food and what to feed them and why, which I found helpful and important. While this is not a book for a small child, it is good for those who are interested in not only the care and feeding for rats but also the scientific points about rats.I would recommend getting a few other rat books first though - I also enjoyed Rats: Complete Care Guide by Debbie Ducommun as well as Training Your Pet Rat (Training Your Pet Series) by Gerry Buscis. These books are far more detailed on caring for your pet rats."
1,Why Do They Leave Rosemary Extract Out of Ingredients?,They are leaving the rosemary extract ingredient out of this product's ingredient summary. If you have a small dog you may already know that if your dog is sensitive to rosemary it may result in seizures. Makes me wonder why this important ingredient information is omitted.
5,Quallity Product,"This is great dog food. It is very nutritious and my dog loves it. It was recommended by our trainer. Fast delivery, too."
1,They changed the ingredients,"I stopped feeding Natural Balance to my dog because they changed the ingredients. I emailed Natural Balance about the changes to their product and they never responded. The ""meat"" rolls now have less meat and more grain and filler, in addition to sugar.Here are the differences between the old formula and the new formula:First seven ingredients of old formula- Lamb, Lamb Hearts, Lamb Kidneys, Lamb Lungs, Whole Wheat Flour, Rice Flour, Calcium CarbonateFirst seven ingredients of new formula - Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, SaltKeep in mind that the ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance. This means that the first ingredient is the most prevalent in the product."
4,Yummy in your dogs tummy,"I am a dog trainer and this is one of the tricks of our trade. While I feel it's a tad overpriced, dogs love it and so do cats. I, like most posters here, cut it into bite sized training nibbles and use it as positive reinforcement during training. Red Barn has a 4 lb food roll which is a tad less expensive, but I have seen NB's roll in pet stores for $11-and some change. The good thing with this roll is you can cut the pieces as big or as small as you want, but once you open a package you must use it. I have never done so, but I assume you can freeze this stuff for future use. The 4 lb roll lasts a pretty long time if you use it as a training aid."
5,Great for disgusing pills and getting your dog to eat!,My Boston Terrier Toby recently had to have his teeth cleaned and wasn't feeling so well after - and he had to take pills to heal from a few extractions he also had. I wasn't able to get him to take his pills and eat his dinner UNTIL I grated this into his bowl and used it to disguise the antibiotic pills. This dog food roll is amazing because it's a food and a treat - and it's nice and soft so you can mold it around a pill if your dog is on meds. Oh - and he goes crazy for this stuff - I think he totally forgot he had his teeth pulled after I started giving him this - that's how happy it made him! Love this!
5,Great treat/training food,"We slice the log, then cut into smaller pieces to be used for training rewards, filling Kongs or special treats once in a while. Our dogs love all of the flavors."
1,Third Ingredient SUGAR?,"The ingredient list above is incorrect. Ordered this and discovered third ingredient is sugar and the crude protein is listed as 11%. Not as high as you expect from that meaty list of ingredients they display here. Here is the list from their website:Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, Salt, Rice Flour, Calcium Carbonate, Egg, Glycerin, Lecithin, Dicalcium Phosphate, Potassium Chloride, Natural Smoke Flavor, Ascorbic Acid, Natural Flavor, Powdered Garlic, Vitamin E Supplement, Kelp Meal, Brewers Yeast, Calcium Disodium, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Rosemary Extract, Canola Oil, Sodium Erythorbate, Vitamin A Supplement, Niacin, Calcium Pantothenate, Sodium Nitrite, Riboflavin Supplement, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Natural Mixed Tocopherols.My dog does go nuts when I open it."
1,Amazon's ingredients list is VERY wrong,"I am so disappointed that the manufacturer has drastically changed the formulation of this food. It can no longer be considered a healthy food. Amazon has not changed its info, which is irresponsible because customers are buying based on the info presented here. The real ingredient list is:Lamb Lungs, Wheat Flour, Sugar, Lamb, Wheat Bran, Lamb Hearts, Salt, Rice Flour.So basically, it's like feeding your dog a lamb-flavored doughnut. Sugar as the third ingredient?! More sugar than actual lamb? Why not just label it ""lamb candy""...?Sad. My dog loved this food. Well, no wonder, I guess. I love doughnuts, too... but I don't eat them."
3,Decent psychobiography on an amazing man...,"John C.H. Wu's insights into the character of the revolutionary Sun Yat-sen are very profound, but I do have a few complaints about this particular work. First, there is a rather wide array of what appear to be printing mistakes (from sideways to upside down words!), and this can get annoying. Secondly, if read as a narrative of Sun Yat-sen's life, it can be fairly confusing. I think Mr. Wu's intention, however, was not to write a biography but rather an expose into the personality and character of the man, which he certainly has done."
5,So you know what you're getting: artist and song list,"How can you pass up a huge collection of great songs at such a low price? This is an excellent overview of the best bands at the turn of the century.1 Newsboys - God Is Not a Secret (feat. tobyMac)2 Audio Adrenaline - Big House (live)3 The O.C.

1,Curled,"When these arrived they were flat, when I took them out of the plastic they curled up. They are impossible to use. This purchase was a total waste of money."
2,"OK, but not the best option for chopping","I found these mats to be only somewhat useful at best. They work in a pinch, but their tendency to curve rather than lie flat makes cutting and chopping a real challenge. They also slide around easily, but placing them on a non-slip mat helps.Perhaps if they were a bit heavier they might lay flat on the counter. As they are, I find I don't use them often and would not purchase them again. I'll stick to regular cutting boards and chopping blocks."
1,horrible,"These mats are cheap. They come permanently curved, meaning they don't lay flat. The idea is great but they need to be made of higher quality materials--heavier and lay flat. Really wanted to like them!"
4,PCC-606 Review,"These cutting boards are pretty nice for the price. They are flexible for easy pouring. I can already see cut marks in them, so I am wondring about their durability over time. But, since I paid $8 for them, I am sure I can get a new set if needed."
3,Choppind Mats are decent and excellent for every so often cooks.,These boards are great for a cook that only uses them one to three times a weak. Because they're made of a cheap plastic they instantly show cutting marks. They aren't really flexible enough to bend with one hand but if you use two they will bend. Keep care not to let them be pinned between items that leave it in a flexed shape when storing though otherwise they'll be nearly impossible to bend back into shape. I was too scared to dishwash them although they say they are dishwasher safe. I still use them just to make snacks or quick meals.
1,Read the one star reviews before buying!,"Click on the one star reviews before buying this - they all say the same thing I found to be true. These were shipped curled and stayed curled, no way to get them uncurled. My recommendation to Amazon would be to stop carrying them. I think this is the first thing I've ever bothered to return from Amazon - absolutely useless."
3,Need to be stored flat.,I love the labels for different uses. BUT because they are flexible the mats curl up and must be stored flat in order to maintain their shape.
2,Cheesy,"I bought these mats back in December. At first, they worked great. I thought if I just hand washed them they would last longer. After a few weeks use they curl up in the middle so bad that I finally dumped them today in the recycling box. Lesson learned. I'm going back to wood."
4,Works great!,"This is my second batch of the cutting mats. I like the sizeand really like the little white ones. They're perfect forslicing an onion or other small jobs. I love them.They tend to not want to lay flat at first, but I'd still usethem in favor of a wood block or even plastic. If one getsto the point that I just really want to replace it, I'm notthrowing away something that was expensive. I kept my plasticboard longer than I wanted to until I found these."
2,"Seemed like a deal, but not so much","I bought these and used them only a few times. In spite of the manufacturer's claim that they're dishwasher safe, they warped and became brittle in the dishwasher. I've had thinner, cheaper cutting mats from Wal-Mart last years and really thought these would be great. I was very disappointed in the product, happy that Amazon makes returns so easy. I don't recommend them."
5,Chopping mats set.,"This is a great set of chopping mats. Handy, tough, easy to clean and easy to put away. Be sure to chop on the correct side (side with print) or you can easily cause damage. Used on the correct side, these work perfectly. Hard to beat for the price."
3,These mats won't lie flat,"I am disappointed that these mats stay in a curved position and I can't seem to get them to lie flat. I did wash them in the dishwasher before using them and perhaps this curved them but they are described as dishwasher safe, so this should not happen."
2,disappointed,"these mats bend way too much and don't stay flat while i'm cutting. so anything i'm chopping starts to spill off the mat. further, the mats were sent in the packaging bent. not worth sending back."
2,Won't stay flat on the counter.,I've only used one of them but I am woefully disappointed. I washed them in the dishwasher before using them. They curled up and I can't get them to lie flat.
4,Works fine. Cheap. Cute. Not for hot foods.,"These aren't the most durable, but they do last through quite a few uses. The colors are cheerful, and they work fine. Their thin shape makes them easy to store. You can even curl them in your hands to make a sort of funnel to easily dump the chopped food into a pot. Nice item, and a bargain. And you can clean them in the dishwasher.Recommended, but with these limitations: (1) Because they are so thin, you don't want to put anything hot onto them -- they will warp. (2) Because they are so light, they can slide around the counter. These limitations eventually made me switch to much more expensive, thick, rubber-footed cutting boards -- but only after a long period using these with good results."
1,Won't stay flat,"At first glance, these seemed like sturdy cutting mats. But the larger size will not stay flat - they curl, making them useless. Cheap price, cheap product."
1,warps too much,"I find this product unusable because all the sheets warped soon after I started using them. I do rinse them with hot water, which understandably causes an immediate warp, but these sheets do not recover their original flatness when cool."
4,Choppong mats,"I like these mats very well and have placed them on the back side of one of my kitchen cabinets with a Command hook, which works very well. The only thing that is only a minor incomvenience is that they have a tendency to slightly curl."
3,Handy but not high quality,These are stiff. They do mark from cutting. They will work well for a while and then I'll replace them. Still a good value since they are cheap. Small enough to fit in the dishwasher when folded over. I have washed them in the dishwasher -- which is nice when cleaning chicken of fish.
2,Not Functional,"I put these cutting boards in the dishwasher once and they all curled up on the sides. So not only is it hard to cut on a rounded cutting board, but they don't wear well either. The only time I use them is when my good cutting boards are already dirty."
1,WORST TOY EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"Have you ever seen this toy at TOYS ""R"" US? Doesn't it look like the best toy ever? Well, it's NOT! I got it for my birthday and it didn't work, then it worked for only about 5 minutes! Then it went bust again! Do not, and I mean DO NOT buy this toy."
1,poor service,poor service...missing parts...they tell you to go out and buy them yourself...rating should be OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT ONE
3,THE PRESIDIO,"FOR TWO CENTURIES THIS ARMY FORTRESS STOOD GUARD AT THE FOOT OF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE...The PRESIDIO has never witnessed a war, but tonight it will witness a murder. SEAN CONNERY is the steel-eyed Colonel determined to hunt down the killer his way. MARK HARMON is the streetwise detective who's clashed with the Colonel before.THE PRESIDIO is the story of an officer who lives by the book. His command is being threatened by a murderer and his daughter has fallen for something just as dangerous; the cop on the case.It is a search for a vicious killer -- that leads to a gripping, dramatic, surprising and brutally wrenching climax."
2,Cheap Junk,The pump looks alright and comes with the standard set of needles and adapters. It broke after pumping up 2 tires. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money and get something durable. This thing is little more than junk.T
2,lasted 2 weeks,"why cant someone make a pump to last, not sturdy and and had grease leaking form it with in 2 weeks"
2,Not Worthy of Its Look-Alike Predecessors,"Despite bearing a good resemblance to its ancestors, the TEKTON 6092 20-Inch Tire Pump has substandard quality. The handle is unreinforced, low-cost plastic; there is no check valve at the bottom of the hose, which means that pressure in the tire will force the handle back up, which is very inefficient; the chuck has no metal reinforcements; and the cylinder seems ""tinny.""Of course, this floor pump costs less than $10, and as such, perhaps I was expecting too much, whereby it would be of equivalent quality to the identical design/color pump purchased 14 years ago, also manufactured in China, whose hose finally cracked."
2,By Temptations and By War (MechWarrior: Dark Age),"I have read every book in the BattleTech, Mechwarrior, and the Dark Age Series. I not impressed with this book. The story line came out very slow. It can be compared to the very first book in the BattleTech Series: Cloak and Dagger. This book is written by one of my favorite BattleTech/Mechwarrior aurthors so I expected more out of this book. All in all I have not been impressed with this new Dark Age series. It does not seem to have the flare or sepense that the other series has. I can only hope that it gets better in the furture."
5,Replacement Copy,My first copy is being held together with a rubber band. This is a replacement copy that I will be reading again and/or lending out. Excellent for new & seasoned Christians to read and re-read!
1,Not closed captioned,"Hard to rate this item. On the one hand I'm a Allo Allo afficionado and Series Four is just as funny as the other series. But on the other hand I have a hearing condition and was expecting this product to be closed captioned as mentioned on Amazon. Well, it is not!"
1,Absolutely useless,"I have dozens of Ford Mustang performance books and this one particularly is the worst of all. It does not tell you in anyway how to perform these titled projects, all what it tells you is ""This is something you can do and it may cost you around this much"" so dont expect to find any illustrated steps on how to carry out these projects. They could be OK for somebody who just bought his first Mustang yesterday. So my advice is: look elsewhere. My recommendations for you are these 2 (Ford Windsor Small Block Performance by Isaac Martin), and (Mustang Performance Handbook by William R. Mathis). My personal favorites."
3,Dense book in search of an editor,"Gutstein's premise -- that people on the spectrum need to learn emotional sharing -- is quite a different approach from the standard therapies. Most therapies work on functional skills, whereas Gutstein works on functional motivation. The two go hand-in-hand, and that's where his book has value. However, it's not a very readable book, and it needs extensive editing to be accessible to its preferred audience of parents and therapists. Look instead for one of his two follow-up books, which give an overview of RDI and also provide specific exercises."
3,We use it in the RV,I got this to use in the RV Wardrobe which is small and we needed more storage space. It works as expected and hasn't fallen apart.
2,Velcro? Really?,"Nice unit, until it falls down because all the weight is being supported by Velcro. Can you say ""design flaw""? Get one with metal hooks."
3,Ordered this for my husband's sweaters.,"My husband needed a space to have his sweaters folded and after looking at several of this type units I chose this one. First, the good points: it is well made, easy to install on closet rod (will fit several size rods), very attractive in the closet, two sweaters will fit on each shelf, and the dividers in the bottom section fold down so you can use them as full shelves as well. There is only one negative: One my husband wears Medium sweaters and they are too wide for these shelves and hang out about two inches. I had tried to find one that had a closure of some type to protect from lint and dust and couldn't find one. I am now on the look for that again. This shelving unit is fine just not suitable for men's sweaters."
4,Pleased,"Great, fast service. Perfect for travelling and I don't have to worry about any plastic chemicals. My only complaint is that they don't come in other sizes, since baby is eating 4-5oz now. But I'm just sure to have two on hand. It is no sweat to switch a nipple. I will be purchasing this again."
4,Hangnail: Facing Changes,"""Facing Changes"" from Hangnail has a light pop-punk sound that is truly spirutal and uplifting to listen to. ""Facing Changes"" is an album that every song is basically good. So you can't lose. ""God will always be here..."""
4,Good CD... Looking forward to seeing them perform live...,"Ordered this cd because I will be going to see them perform live at the Creepy Crawl in St Louis. Have enjoyed the cd, it grows on me each time I listen to it. A lot of the songs sound the same to me still but I expect that will diminish as I get more familiar with the songs. Many of the lyrics promote positive Christian ideas. If you like this kind of music then this is a cd that you don't have to worry a whole lot about whether or not you are eating cookies with chocolate chips in them or cookies with just a little bit of dog dooey mixed in to them (if you get my drift!)."
5,hangnail just gets better,"It seems all punk bands are maturing into a pop drivin melodic sound. I think it is all for the better!! They have just the coolest sound in christain punk. This c.d. is similar to the last one but the intros and the fast pace guitar isnt as jerky and stuff its alot more awsomerer shall I say, it is a must get!!! plus the accoustic EP is awe inspiring"
3,kickin ChristiaN punk!!,"i love this CD!!! every song is unique, with wonderful messages. Teriffic the punk rock sound, the band members are down to earth, great people, and their music is AWESOME. I dont care if your christian or not, i dont care if you like punk or not, i dont care if you are DEAF, buy this CD now!!!!!!!!"
3,NSA starter,This starter fits the tacoma v6 perfectly. It is not the cold weather version. Its probably the 1.4kw version not the 1.8. Time will tell how long it will last but its much cheaper than buying an OEM part.
4,Good Intro to probability theory and statistics,"I found this book quite thorough and very well written. I liked it a lot because, although not advanced, it does not lack mathematical rigour. I thouroughly recommended for anybody who needs a sound basis for probability and statistics."
4,cool classical/rock/jazz fusion,"This is a very interesting combination of the classical and rock/jazz worlds of guitar playing. All four guitarists have amazing chops and they're all quite tasteful on this recording. If you're a fan of Barrueco, DiMeola, Morse, or Summers, check out this CD. I had heard Barrueco and Summers before, and knew of DiMeola and Morse by reputation, so I had an idea of what to expect...but ""Nylon & Steel"" surpassed those expectations. Very cool, indeed."
2,Disappointing,It is simply not up to par.Having Al DiMeola as a guest artist artist on this recording made me want to listen.The music is too mono-tone. No flare to this one.No excitement.
3,Odeon was not composed by Barrueco.,"I would like to clarify that the piece Odeon, mentioned in the editorial review, was not composed by Barrueco. Odeon was composed in the beginning of the 1900's by Ernesto Nazareth, a Brazilian composer. You can find a sample of the same tune on the listing of the CD ""Mandolin Master Of Brazil: Original Classic Recordings, Vol. 2"" a very good compilation of Jacob do Bandolim. I hope this was just an editorial mistake and that the original composer has been recognized on the CD."
2,simply a mess,"This is nothing more than a collection of jam sessions with various guitarists. Mindless gibberish made in a garage by bored musicians who hatched up a plan to scam their fans out of $ by releasing their worthless strumming. They should've kept these tracks where they belonged, in a closet."
2,Looks Cheap,"I ordered this to use as a portfolio for my photography. But when it arrived it looked so cheap that I would be embarrassed to present work from it. So I guess it's an okay product, as long as you aren't looking to make something look professional."
5,Kodak KAA2HR Ni-MH Battery Pack,"After wasting several hard earned dollars toying with non-rechargable batteries for my Kodak digital camera, I finally got smart and made this purchase. I grew very tired of losing picture taking opportunities with my previous batteries and I knew I had to make a change.These batteries last a very long time between charges and they do not take all that long to recharge. For the small price, it is the only way to go for your camera.They are highly recommended."
1,I hate it!,"The battery seemed to be charged but when I went to use it, it did not work. Very disappointing purchase!"
1,Battery Won't charge,"This battery will not charge, I put it on my camera charger and it is green foe maybe 10 minutes, the it flaskes red, I think it may be a little longer than the original....what do I do now?? I have been away for a monthGeorge Shanta"
5,Mt Batteries,I am very pleased with the product and the service received. My carema will work well thanks to you for a long time. Thank you
5,Kodak,These batteries are working very well with our cameras. We are in a preschool setting so they get plenty of work.
5,Kodak KAA2HR Ni-MH Rechargeable Digital Camera Battery,"Kodak KAA2HR Ni-MH Rechargeable Digital Camera BatteryThe battery in my Kodak EasyShare C340 died after 3 years of regular use. So I bought a new one and it seems to be doing what it is supposed to. Providing power to the camera. Just install in camera, put camera on charging dock charge overnight and voila! back in business."
4,As advertised,Fits my camera just fine and is an exact replacemetn for the original.**Warning** Do not leave your camera just sitting on the charger. This ruins your battery over a period of time.Nothing wrong with the battery itself; this is a charger issue.
5,love it,I was so happy to find this battery for my old camera...it worked perfectly and i recommend this to others
1,NOT CHARGED AND TURNS OFF CAMERA,"I am sorely disappointed, the battery wasn't charged up and every time I put it in the camera, it turns everything off."
3,It was for a present.,"I gave a camera as a present, however I needed a new battery. I bought an original battery because I wanted the camera to work. So far I have not received any complaints about the camera. Watch out with the shipping charges, they are as much as the battery itself."
4,Better than the battery that came with my charger,The Kodak KAA2HR Ni-MH Rechargeable Digital Camera Battery last longer than the original batteries that came with my camera! tHIS BATTERY IS NOW MY PRIMARY WHILE THE ORIGINAL IS THE BACK-UP oops caps)
1,trash,"i order Kodak KAA2HR Ni-MH Rechargeable Digital Camera Battery and i had send the seller a bad feedback, a complaint about the batteries not working, the seller hasn't reply to me or even try to contact me at all. I pay pretty good money for this batteries, the package was open when i got it and the batteries didn't work from day one, i would like my money refunded to my account or a new battery. It's a shame there are honest people up in here.you may contact me at pinkym7@msn.com or 413-231-3483thank u. i'll be waiting for my respond. I hope this time i do get an answer to my many emails."
1,Expired,I bought 2 of these batteries because they are so hard to find. I was very disappointed when I received them. They were both VERY expired. NOT impressed!!!
5,Long Lasting Camera Battery,This was a replacement for the same battery that came with my camera over 5 years ago. Took well over 7000 photos with the last one. Thought that was a very good life for a camera battery.
1,Used Battery Not New As Martketed,The battery showed up not in the orginal packing. Therefore i do not beleive that they are selling you a new product.
5,About to toss the camera.....but the new battery saved the day.,"I paint murals and walls and must have good pics to share. My Kodak camera started acting up and I thought I would have to buck up and just get a new one.Turns out that the rechargable battery was the problem, replaced the battery (great deal at Amazon) and Voila! Camera good as new. Whew."
1,Does not fit my camera,This does not fit the Kodak Z712 camera so don't be mistaken that since it fits the Z710 it is close enough. It is not.
1,What's the point?,"I was an English Major in college. I'm a huge advocate of literacy in general, and anything that gets people (especially kids/teens) to read. But this mockery of a book is entirely, well... stupid. It is word for word and action for action the dialog and movements from the show.There is no hidden depths here. It's written first person point of view of Rory, and frankly, Rory wouldn't write this boringly.Television (and movies) as a springboard for novels is a great idea. Unfortunately, at the moment I can only think of sci-fi examples such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, and Dark Angel. But I'm sure there are others. These novel series are in addition to the show. They are not direct episodes transcribed from the show. They offer deeper character analysis and unexplored avenues of adventure.If you're that interested in the subject, try getting your hands on a shooting script for Gilmore Girls episodes. At least they're a more interactive read."
4,well they fit the item,I have used part of them and will be using more of them when I make some Peppermint chocolate Ice cream and I will make 10 of the ice cream popcicles so the Ice cream last longer . .
2,"Too much money, too little product",I won't be buying these anymore. They lasted about a week. I am looking to find a reusable version to make popsicles.
1,overpriced popsicle sticks,"There are only 50 sticks in the package. Now I know why they do not tell you how many to a package in the ad. The sticks are fine, just way too much money for popsicle sticks."
3,Cheaper at Walmart,"I bought this for some science experiment I was trying to do, but I realized Walmart sells something similar and even cheaper, overall the product is OK though"
3,Outrageous Shipping!,"I did not realize that the shipping on these $1.99 popsicle sticks (50 in a bag) were $4.95 for each bag ordered! Therefore; I ordered three bags thinking if I am going to pay $4.95 shipping on a $1.99 item, I might as well order a few bags. Needless to say, I ordered three bags of popsicle sticks and my total order was around $20.00 for less than $6.00 of merchandise that weighed very little! I did not pay attention because I ordered a few things at that time. I learned a very vaulable lesson, check each and every item, the SHIPPING for each item, total, etc. Please do not be foolish like me!Progressive Freezer Popsicle Sticks, Pack of 50"
5,A practical guide for changing a parent's behavior.,":I am surprised that the principles in the book are not more commonly used by educators. Clear and practical information and guidelines cover every page.:Many of the behavioral modifications recommended by Dr. Maag don't just work in our interaction with our kids, they also work quite well with adults.:Probably the most interesting benefit I got from the book has been the opportunity to alter my own behavior, which, in turn, made a world of difference in helping our daughter to alter hers.:Highly recommended reading for parents, educators and for anyone looking to find different, more effective ways of dealing with others and with our own imprinted habits. An open mind is required for the readers of this book to gain any noticeable benefit."
2,Good - but not what most viewers will expect,"This DVD is ""cute"" and interesting and definitely gives some insights into the lives of Theravada Buddhist monks. However - please be aware that this DVD was NOT created in Thailand (as one would expect looking at the cover) - but it was filmed entirely in a Thai-Buddhist temple located somewhere in New Zealand - the author never explains just where she is, but one can tell from the many signs written in English.For someone who has lived in Thailand extensively and is very familiar with the culture and the religion practised there by over 98% of the population, it was disappointing to see this ""report"" done NOT inside Thailand. There is truly a huge difference in what is presented on this DVD and what one would experience being inside this wonderful country (Thailand). This DVD can be a ""guide"" for a first-time exposure for people new to Buddhism - or who want to know more and it answers quite a few elementary questions."
5,Joyful,"Joyful.Worth the effort.Humourous,serious,warm,delightful.The monk says ""It is no good just saying loving kindess.You have to do it,you have to show it""Wilding may work in a more subtle and upbeat way than other directors and presenters, as shown by threads weaving through this film, but her work is no less powerful for it."
5,My son LOVES this book!,This is such a cute book! My 3 year old son requests it often and loves talking about the different fish in it.
4,cute story,"I loved the bright colors of the book and it was a nice short story, it easily keeps the interest of my one year old."
4,A great story-it's like watching a movie unfold,"This novel is engaging on many levels. I found the theme of immigrant assimilation into American culture thoughtful and relevant to today. Immigration is the story of America and Hamamura's novel reminds the reader of past shameful immigration policies and it motivates the reader to think about the challenges facing today's immigrants.. This is a serious theme but people who enjoy historical romance will not be disappointed. Color of the Sea is a compelling story of lovers caught up in cultural constraints, family commitments, and historical circumstance. This story has the ring of truth-like Sam Hamada, the book's central character, Hamamura's father was a GI translator who returned to his family home in Hiroshima after the war to help his surviving family members."
3,Awkward prose and structure spoil a potentially good book,"I checked previous reviews and was astonished to find so many readers giving this book five-star raves. The topic appealed to me because little fiction has appeared (to my knowledge) about World War Two - what led up to it and how it was experienced, from the viewpoint of the Japanese and Japanese-Americans who lived through those years.I agree with the reviewer who finds the use of present tense awkward and inappropriate to the plot. The narration and prose style reminded me of the cheap magazines my aunts were reading (and I was forbidden) in the 1920s and 1930s. There is a great story there, but it is told very badly."
5,Outstanding book re the beauty and resilience of the human soul!,This is one of the best written novels I have ever read. It pulls you into connection w the characters feeling their emotions and bonding with their humanity and spirits. I loved the way the author writes...beautiful imagery and feeling throughout!
2,just OK,"This book held a lot of promise but didn't deliver for me. A lot of the potential plot developments such as the treatment of the Japanese in the camps and the terrible prejudice shown them during the war are glossed over. The author's use of words is compelling but he too often uses them to make scenes that are very contrived and just corny. The main characters are unbelievable in their perfection. Sam excels at everything he does and if there's an emergency Sam will swoop in to save the day. In spite of the shortcomings, I enjoyed the book. I just wish it had been better."
4,Life At A Distance,"This book focuses on the lives of two Japanese characters who attempted to create a family together in the midst of World War II. Author John Hamamura tells this story as a painter would, scattering colors onto a canvas-- seemingly haphazardly-- until they take a meaningful shape. Some important historical elements receive almost no focus, some subplots appear to have no lasting impact... but then you finish the book. You realize that you did so in less than a day, without regret. You understand that this was not a book about two people falling in love, but a book about two lives merging and continuing on afterward. It is an illustration of their lives as we ourselves would see our own, with some moments being more vibrant, more memorable, than others."
5,sam's story,"This is a wonderful story that holds your attention throughout, and helps you learn about the clash and blending of cultures as well. It was located in the Young Adult section in my library, but as with many books today, is an excellent read for adults as well. His story should still resonate today, and reminds us of some of the casualties of wartime."
4,Wonderful and deep,If you enjoy a story that has a multi-faceted plot then I highly recommend Color of the Sea. It is a novel that really makes you think about life.The author paints a vivid scene with talented prose and rich description. The characters are real and engaging. This novel is for anyone who enjoys a deep read. I just can't say enough about it. I am recommending it to all my friends. Awesome!
3,"Not Stellar, But Not Awful Either","Oldfield shows some really good work with the thematic instrumentation for this album. However, it lacks a little in the aspect of being something that you will remember beyond hearing it. This is definitely not a Not of This Earth or Surfing With the Alien (Joe Satriani), so don't expect anything along those lines. Definitely not a work that will get you to drive out and purchase it - but not one that you will be looking to ditch off at the nearest CD reseller either."
2,Surprisingly Boring!!,"I know that Mike created all the sounds you hear on this CD using various guitars, but that doesn't excuse the fact that this is simply not up to his usual standards. There are a couple of standouts...but as a whole, it's just average. Here's hoping Mike comes back with an album towards the ""Five Miles Out"" or ""Discovery"" vein...."
5,Echniancea,"I have found this product to be most effective by using it once you detect a cold coming on, it either helps to eliminate the cold from taking place or at best will minimize the time of the cold."
1,Problems with these cds,"I've tried Sony Direct write software and Roxie and tried two different computers and can't get these cds to perform properly.Either they have a problem with completing the formatting or if formatted, I get reboot error messages when trying to write or read at times. Avoid these cds."
1,Don't Buy...,"I wish I had read all the other review before. I got a 25 pack RW. The first two CD's got formatted on SONIC successfully. When I tried the CD's, it would say corrupted disk. Tried many of the remaining CD's and it would error out during formatting."
1,Unreadable cds -- don't buy,"At first I thought I must have done something wrong when I recorded my music to these discs since it would not play back on any of my regular cd players. Then I read the review here and realized it was the cd-rw that was terrible. Yes, sometimes, the cd burner would not even recongnize it as re-writable. It plays back ok on my cd-rom, but would not do so on regular cd players. I know it has to be the disc because my other cd-rw (not Memorex) plays back ok on all disc players I have. So I agree with most of reviewers here--don't buy Memorex. Sure wish I had known this before I bought mine."
1,I'll never buy Memorex again after these,Caveat emptor. The quality control at the Memorex CD-RW disc plant is sorely lacking. Only two out of the ten discs in the pack even worked straight from the box. The other 8 lack the necessary absorption properties to send them on their way to being coasters. You too will pay too much for jewel cases should you purchase this DOA discs.
1,"Garbage, they even had the audacity to say I was lying","They were trying to grill me on an email, asking for receipts etc... whatever man. I've banned EVERYTHING memorex from my house because of this."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I am sure this is a fine product, but these CD-RW's did not work in my older, stand-alone CD Recorder. They are made for units that burn faster."
1,What they're saying is true,"Should be a class action suit. I have a 20-pack of these (there were no other CD-RWs at the store and it was the third store I visited) and I've been throwing them in the trash after the first write. If you can't get two writes out of them, why buy rewritables at all? Real garbage. I want my money back."
1,Unacceptably poor quality control,"I thought that maybe I had bought a box of these that had been dropped or something. The first three of four disks from the Memorex box my computer deemed ""unreliable"" after it tried to confirm the burn. I burned other disks (from Fuji - CD-R and CD-RW) on the same day with no problems. I came here and saw that the problem with Memorex CDs has been going on for at least five years!!! Oy! That's ethically unacceptable. It's one thing for a company to make a mistake (don't we all), but not to correct it in that length of time? Shame on Memorex.Here I thought I was saving time by running into Target on my way home and finding these. It would have been quicker if I had just read reviews of other brands here and ordered something that I could depend on.(Made in Taiwan)"
1,Be careful here,Be careful here. There is a disparity between what the description states and what the photograph shows. You may actually be buying the lower value item.
1,Horrible Product!,"I recently purchased a new laptop, and began the task of backing up my work to transfer over. EVERY SINGLE ONE of the cds that I burned were un-readable. Because the problem was so consistent, I figured that there had to be a problem with my CD/DVD drive. Among several other troubleshooting measures, I went so far as to contact the manufacturer of the new laptop to inquire about replacement parts. Luckily, I did a search on this product and saw all of the frustrated comments. I went out and bought the comparable SONY cd-rws and everything worked perfectly. I can't believe that this product is being sold. The cds are completely useless. Don't lose money like I did"
1,Expensive Beer Mats,"...These CD-RWs are absolute junk. I bought these thinking I could not go wrong because I have used memorex CD-Rs without any problems. Unfortunately I have wasted several HOURS on 4 different machines using up to date patched software and in 1 case a brand new CD-ReWriter. So far I have only been able to format 1 of these CDs - great but I cannot erase anything and now my CD-RW will not recognise the disk. I really wonder if the people who highly rate this product are using the same thing. I would have rated it 0 stars if there had been the option...For what its worth I have used TDK, Kodak and Philips CD-RWs without any problems........"
1,Memorex CD-RWs are bad,"I got one of these discs free with my new burner. The first time I used it was fine, however the second burn did not work. It could not be read, and even worse, cannot be erased. Sure am glad this was ""free""!"
1,This Product is bad.,"Ok so I bought ten of these on this website and my CD Burner kept on saying that there was no CD in the drive. I oppened another one to see maybe it was only that one but that one didn't work eather, so I oppened the third one and it didn't work. I thought maybe it was my CD Burner so I came back to amazon.com to buy a new cd burner and then I just wanted to see the reviews for the cd-rw and when I saw them I understood that it wasn't the cd burner it was the cd-rws. I tried to see how I could retearn it but it says it had to be retearned within 30 days of buying them and today is the 31. Oh, I'm so mad. What am I going to do with these things? I can't sell them becase they are no good. So listen people don't buy Memorex CD-RWs."
1,Does not work,"These discs do not work with IOMEGA Preadator drive! Also, my friends who have other brands of drives are also having problems.I recommend TDK and Imation."
1,Memorex CD-RW Discs,"I recently installed Easy CD Creator 6 and attempted to format several brand new Memorex CD-RW discs. All attempts on two different PCs with different burners (both with ECDC6) failed so it had to be either the software or the discs. I tried with a new Sony CD-RW disc and everything (formatting, burning) went smoothly. I am convinced Memorex CD-RW discs are fatally flawed."
3,Try something else,"I bought a box of these cd-rws before i read the other reviews, and believe me, i kicked myself. I've gone through about 4 of them, and so far have had only one gripe. when i tried to erase one of the disc, it wouldn't erase. I tried two different programs, but neither could do it. Other than that, i so far haven't had any problems. But to be on the safe side, buy a different cd-rw."
1,Seem to be poor quality,"Bought one box two weeks ago, and half the discs would send my CD drive into convulsions when inserted. Bought another box a week later from a different location with the same result. Your experience may vary, but I can't recommend them."
1,2012&#65292; almost 2013 They are still not working?,"I got two of these and I have to say the slim disk package is cool. However, none of them work for me. I am using Nero 9 under Windows 7 32-bit. My HP laptop has a HP DVD/CD RW drive. I was first using Windows burner and it was not working. (cannot even write some file into it......not to say erase......) I then downloaded Nero 9 and tried on this new software hoping that I could get it work. The result was disappointed though. The only thing I could see is a circle of ""dark mark"" near the center of disks. So right now I have two Memorex discs with no data at all and cannot erase and try re-burn something into them. I point is not say this brand is junk but to figure out what should I do to make my disks work. Anyone who made this kind of Disk worked please let us know. Thanks."
1,These Disks are Terrible!!,"I bought a 5-Pack of these at Home Depot. The first disk I put in, my Drive didn't recognize. The second disk I put in, locked up my formatting software (I use Nero Burn ROM software).I took the rest of them back. They are useless. I will never buy anything from Memorex again!"
5,A super book,I play alot of muni golf and most golf books are a bit too much on the crustiness of golf. I love the game and will bet 2 bucks on any first tee. This book gives me the same feel....the love of the game and an inside look that I would never ever get to see. The stories are incredilbe. My only complaint is that I would love to have it on audio so I could here the limey's voice again. Go Ben Wright.
3,"Good, but . . .","Needed more stories about golfers and tournaments (especially the pros outside the ropes), less about the Ryder Cup, even less about the CBS announcers and much less about Ben's name-dropping of ""stars"" (most of them dead) at the end. Well, I guess he had to use something to fill the other 150 pages. NOTE: please bring Ben back to TV golf! What about it NBC, now that you brought Marv back?"
5,Great reading for all!,"What a wonderful and storied life Ben Wright has led.How anyone can pack that much fun in one lifetime is amazing.Ben pulls no punches, does not leave the reader wondering who he is referring to and tells about one experience after another. A must read for all golfers.It also gives great insight into the inner workings of televising golf tournaments. One hell of a book!!!"
3,"Par, but just barely","The hype for this book was so tremendous that I expected to be riveted for hours on end. Sadly, such was not the case. There are a few interesting stories here, but the focus is wrong. Any good editor would know that no one gives a hoot about Ben Wright the individual; except perhaps his bout with alcoholism (which is interesting b/c his drinking got so bad that his friends and family had an intervention, he went to a clinic, and then decided that he really didn't need to stop drinking. Uh, may want to rethink that one, Ben). Anyway, the book is interesting when he writes about the people, places and events of golf which we all wish we had some personal insights about. Since only about half the book is about those things, only about half the book is interesting. Overall, a good effort, but a better editing job would have helped."
5,CBS...BRING BEN BACK!!,A must read for anyone who loves golf! Ben is the kind of guy who tells it like it is.Ben is the best at what he does
2,Good Bounces & Bad Lies,"Well, I suppose there will be a certain amount of ego in any autobiography, but this one tops them all. There are so many stories of Wright being in or near every significant golf event in history, I thought I was reading the Forrest Gump story. Plus, he went on and on with adolescent glee about how many times he, Pat Sunnerall and others were so drunk, thrown out of restaurants and hung over that one wonders how CBS ever put on a golf telecast. However, there were some interesting insights to numerous Ryder Cup matches.Most people who read this book are looking for Wright's version of the infamous Joanne Carner/ Valerie Helmbreck story, but the aftermath was somewhat anticlimatic.Then there are Wright's vicious attacks on Gary McCord, while all the time claiming to be his friend. I guess fate evened this out, as McCord is still broadcasting and entertaining, while Wright labors in obscurity; accent and all."
3,"I read it, but it never captured my interest","Storyline seemed to be slow moving. Not only the paperback is fiction, but the locations mentioned in the story (i.e., mountains, rivers) were apparently fictional as well. This paperback would not be in my first round of draft picks for exceptional entertainment."
3,Historically Interesting,"When I was just a kid I used to listen on the radio to Fulton Lewis,Jr.This book was written in 1954. It was reprinted in paperback in 1958 by Human Events. It chronicles his career up thru his strong support of Senator Joseph McCarthy. At one time he had sixteen million daily listeners on the Mutual Broadcasting System. So, he was quite influential. I wish someone would write an upgraded full blown biography. Still, from a historical perspective, it makes for an interesting quick read."
5,Finally!!!,"Finally this 80's gem is released on DVD. This series was must watch tv for me as a child. It's a warm, funny, touching show about a child who loses both of his parents and is taken in by his father's best friend and his new wife. Webster is adorable and George and M'am are great as new parents trying to raise a 6 year old. Thank goodness they're finally releasing it!"
5,Webster in the house.,I discovered this classic series in reruns as a child and now I have it on dvd. THANK YOU SHOUT FACTORY! I'm glad we have you and I can't wait for your next classic release.
5,"It's true, the cream rises to the top!!!","Michael has reprised and re-recorded a dozen of his favorite tunes from his long and illustrious career, going all the way back to ""Geronimo's Cadillac"" (my first contact with his music) and ending with the beginning of his current incarnation, the senior cowboy songster. To be sure, ""Wildfire"", ""Carolina In The Pines"", and ""Cherokee Fiddle"" are included, although you might find those on a number of other collections. What sets this apart are some tunes that have only been available a time or two before, and, in one case, on no MMM collection (Thom Schuyler and Paul Overstreet's wonderful ""A Long Line Of Love""). Some of you may have most of these already, but the updated arrangements are more than worth the price of admission here, and this is certainly a welcome addition to my collection. I just wish he'd come to the mid-Atlantic a little more frequently!!!"
1,I'm Disappointed!,"I was extremely disappointed to find these tunes to be all remakes of the originals. I love Michael's music, but he missed the mark this time. The instrumentals aren't close to the originals and Michael strains to reach each high note. Top tunes have been redone and are almost as good. Put out the originals!! I'll pay extra!!"
4,Doom is one of the best crust bands of all time. . .bar none,These young (then young anyway) lads blew the world away when they first came together back in 1987. This particular collection of songs is sort of like a early 'best of' and I highly recommend it. Doom obliterates all opposition
3,Get NAPALM DEATH instead,More left wing crust from DOOM.Not a very fun or technical album but if you like extreme noise terror or icons of filth you will probably like this.Fast paced songs but kind of repedative.Not worth 20 bucks.
3,Undead and ho-hum...,"Valley-gal-turned-vampire Betsy returns in this comedic romance sequel. What started off amusing seemed to have fallen a little flat in this novel. Betsy's air-brained antics can only take you so far. Plus her ""love/hate relationship"" with Sinclair gets a bit old. To be honest, I think Sinclair's a little too good for Betsy. Betsy dishes on him for most of the book, and then suddenly is hopelessly attracted to him? Please. I guess I dislike the ""I LOVE you I hate you crud."" Its boring. Plus I found the story about the murdered kid and the outcome... Exceedingly creepy. Instead of feeling uplifted at the end of that subplot thread I found it disturbing. I don't care for maudlin stuff in my humorous romance. 3 stars. An average read. Nothing to get excited about."
3,A little confusing on the dialogs,"I received the book on Fri and finished reading it on Sat :)This book ... I find it really hard to identify who says what. Who said 'I never listen - that pisses me off'? I even had to read over the dialogs more than once just to understand what's happening or who said that.Also, too little on the relationship between the King and the Queen ;pPerhaps I need to read book 3 first?"
3,Not as good as the first,"I have to confess, I found this second book not as good as the first one. It was just average. I like the sarcasm and tone (which I was more prepared for this time), but the plot felt sort of hollow to me. Most of the book is Betsy arguing with other people over various issues - where to live, whether or not to work, who loves who, etc. I didn't think there was really enough chemistry between Betsy and Sinclair here, though they do have their moments. And they don't really solve the mystery as much as they just happen upon the solution. I find the series entertaining enough to continue, but I'm hoping for a little more oomph in the next one."
3,"Entertaining on a quick read scale, but...","If you like Charlaine Harris' ""Dead"" series, featuring the character, friend of the vampires, ""Sookie Stackhouse"", you will probably enjoy this series also. Davidson's lead character, ""Betsy"" IS a vampire and a ditzy one at that. Inexplicably, she has powers that no other vampire has, but because she is so silly, none of the vampire community takes her seriously and problems ensue.I could like this character much better if there was some sort of cunning beneath her outer ""blonde behavior"", but the constant whining and shallow repetitive protests as she denies her feelings for Eric (big handsome undead King)and complaints about her duties as the new queen of the vamps grow tiresome.I will buy the next book when it comes out in paperback, but I'm hoping it'll have more meat (pun intended)."
4,Better than the first...,"I liked this book better than her first. We are getting to know her characters a little more. I like that the ""Queen"" and ""King"" of the Vampires are still trying to ""get together"". It would be too easy and too obvious to have them fall madly in love. This is a lot more fun."
2,a letdown from the first one....,"while the first book in this series was cute and refreshing, sadly this one was, to be honest, just dumb! While Betsy seemed frank and funny, kind of like a ""sex in the city"" vampire in ""unwed""- she is a screechy, whiney b*tch in this one.The tendancy of the writer to have Betsy continually think how sexy Sinclair is while all the time pushing him away, calling him vile names and saying ""I hate you""?!??! What, are we in kindergarten? The worst-when Betsy calls him Finkclair-sounds like a after school special :( And the plot? What plot!Glad I haven't purchased any more of this series. If you must read this, I suggest used or from the library.2 stars"
2,Back to the drawing board...,"A little light on plot. While the premise of this series is amusing, the author needs to spend a little more time on her books instead of cranking them out one after the other. The plot was not in the least bit compeling and the main character was just plain annoying. I'll give her points for Sinclair. He has some ""Angel"" like qualities. In-depth storytelling this ain't. Good for the morning train commute into the city."
1,She's back!,"Again, loaned to me...I'm so glad I didn't actually pay for this book...I read the second story hoping Davidson had added some substance to Betsy. Well, I'm glad I didn't bet her BLAHniks on it.My first Davidson book was ""The Royal Treatment"" and I was a fan immediately. I've put my admiration on hold until she stops writing this series. I've got Derik's Bane sitting on my desk right now...let's hope she's better with werewolves than she is with vamps. With Betsy's reign due to last 1000 years, if she's not, I'm headed back to my MacAlister books!"
5,Entertaining To The Max!,I was lucky enough to receive an advance copy of this book and boy did I have a great time reading it. The story is entertaining to the max. You won't be disappointed!
1,Piece of insipid tripe - A total waste of time and money!!!,"I do not understand how others have rated this total waste time with over a star. The character build is redundant and immature. With the vampire genre, some character development would have been nice. The language is lazy, sophomoric and totally unbelievable for a character over the age of 13. The author writing style and character development is summed up quite easily in her own Author's Note as being ""lazy""."
3,Tolerable but barely,"I read a great deal of books in the last few years. The most part of this series was tolerable, but Betsy progressively became more and more annoying. There was very little evidence of growth in the character. In terms of maturity, the character had none. The protagonist sounded more like an adolescent versus a 20 some year old. She was whiny, needy, and selfish. I could barely count any endearing qualities.It was hard to relate to any of the characters because the entity of the characters wer unrealistic. Actually, the entire book was unrealistic. In want century is a ""mansion"" or ""castle"" rent-able for $3000 a month? try $10000 to $30000. The author's description of shoes were over exaggerated and unnecessary. The description showed her lack of knowledge regarding designer shoes. She should have gave up before even attempting the descriptions.Ultimately, this book is long and tedious if you don't like novels with annoying perspectives."
3,"ONLY OK, NOT LIKE THE FIRST!!!","Betsy's back....still Queen of the Undead, but with a shoe fetish that leaves her in desperate need of a job. She finally lands one at Macy*s----much to the dismay of Tina and Sinclair--and it seems as if her ""life"" could quite possibly become as close to normal as a dead girl's could. Then some nut decides to start killing vampires...actually its several nuts, a group of young people..but led by whom? And why? And darn it, why is this Betsy's problem, when she has to get to work?Cute and funny, this novel lacks much of the spark of its predecessor. I didn't laugh out loud at all, and found it to be just silly most of the time. Despite the disappointment, the chemistry is still hothothot between Betsy and Sinclair...I'd certainly read another sequel and hope the author can recapture what she's lost....DYB"
5,twisted & fun,"i'm a big fan of the vampire books, and i love this book. as good as so many others are, they get a bit overdramatic. Betsy is what you would get if you crossed Cordelia & Willow, and made her a vampire. it is a new twist, and it made me chuckle out loud... even while waiting in a doctor's office waiting room, making me break the 'only poliet smiles/no noise' rule. give it a try, it is a good, fun read."
2,"Queen Betsy, you have let me down","I enjoyed the first Queen Betsy novel, so I read the second. I enjoyed that one, although not quite as much, so read the third. I will not read any more of MaryJanice Davidson's novel. The first thing that put me off is the credit at the beginning. Perhaps Ms. Davidson meant to be funny, but I didn't find it funny when her credit for the novel is to - herself. Several times herself. Sorry, but I know all good books have many people involved including caregivers, babysitters, friends, neighbors and all the publishing house employees down to the typist.Okay, so I went on. I have been tolerating her bad language, but then she had to insert a very graphic sex scene that just turned me off. The combination of the frequent coarse language (come on Ms. Davidson, we have a 'few' more words than cussing in our language!) and then the graphic sex - nope. Not going to read anymore. Too bad, she had an interesting premise."
1,Boring,I have been reading this book for a few days now and CAN'T seem to get through it. I don't think it is funny and find it to be rather boring. I was thinking about giving up on it until I came on here and read the reviews. I guess I have to stick with it since so many people raved about it--PAINFUL!!
4,"Good, solid major label sophomore album","Granted, I like other DBS fans was first atracted to their smash ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", but I feel in love with the rest of their album Home. This album is no different. I first heard ""She Is"" on a local rock station, and after my initial shock of it being DBS, I knew I had to have the album. Let me say I was not entirely disappointed. Yes, it's their second major label album, and while not as polished sounding as Home, it's a solid album with great poppy-rock songs. My only complaint is that is can ocasionally get a bit loud in parts, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I miss slower, mellower songs like ""Home."" Keep up the good work guys!"
3,Actually...,"Dwelling originated as a project in DULUTH, MN between Deryl the guitarist and Mike the bass player. After this LP they released a shorter EP that had a much better sound with Jeremy as a new guitar player and James and the new drummer. The band has since broken up and last known all members (none original) moved to Minneapolis to disband into other projects. I should know, I was the bass player.The music can only be described as sort of a heavy horror-core metal with dark lyrical themes and a heavy groove. This recording in no way represents the sonic assault of their live performances. I give it 3 stars because of the sound quality."
2,Have Not Received,I am very upset. I never received the package at all nor my money back I will not order from here again...
4,From The Heart - Oak Ridge Boys,"One of the best. Their rendition of ""Loving God, Loving Each Other"" is fantastic. I recommend it to everyone. I know that you will like it."
5,"High ""praise"" for the Oaks!","After the horrible ""Revival"" gospel set a few years back (no thanks to Leon Russell's aweful, cheesy production), it's refreshing to hear the Oaks return to their gospel roots with a full-blown, high quality set of inspirational tunes sure to please any fan of four-part harmony. All the Boys are in top form on this set, with Richard Sterban hitting some new ""lows"" in the bass department (subwoofer REQUIRED!). 'Fall To Fly' shows amazing tenderness by tenor Joe Bonsall, who usually gets the lead vocal duty on uptempo songs. 'Write Your Name Across My Heart' would be a huge country OR pop single, if it weren't for the biased radio programmers of today. Even if you don't like the message, buy it for the harmonies!"
5,Just what I needed,"This book addresses all the little questions a writer has in that moment of not being sure about grammar, sentence construction, but so much more. It could have been titled, ""The Christian Writer's Second Best Friend"". I keep it beside my computer next to my Dictionary and Thesaurus."
4,"Helpful, but not well made...","I was really expecting something that was much better quality. I don't think that it was the editing that was off, but more the printing that was bad. Some of the words overlap and run together. If you can get past the poor printing, this is a really helpful resource. I found the answers that I was looking for and so much more. I would highly recommend it to Christian writers and editors alike, I just can't give it 5 stars because of the overlapping letters."
4,Helpful Tool for Writers,"This book is a Christian AP Stylebook, basically. If you've wondered what NKJV or MSG stand for, this is the book you need. If you've wondered how to properly quote the Bible in what you write, you need this book."
5,Great Writing Resource,"I enjoyed reading this book for writing and editing projects in the Christian literature. There were some terms that I was well-informed, insightful, and resourceful. It is better than the 1986 version (did not like this one at all). I am glad they improved this version.This will be used for my literary firm while editing projects as well as the Manual of Style by Kate Turabian (University of Chicago Press)."
5,Excellent Resource,"An excellent resource and thorough guide for anyone writing or editing Christian/Catholic text. I'd go so far as to say this is not only a valuable guide, but an essential one."
3,I wish there had been a review before I bought mine.,"The quality is not what I expected. They are very light weight compared to others I have seen. I wanted bowls that were not too deep like those at Bed, Bath & Beyond, but these are so shallow that while using a hand mixer, I had cake mix flying all over the kitchen on low speed! The capacities are not as stated as noticed by another reviewer. I am keeping them because I like the way they stack and don't take up a lot of space, but I would have purchased a different set had I known what I know now. Costco had a deep set with lids at Christmas time for about the same price. Oh well, live and learn."
4,Nice for the price but...,"When I got my set, the capacities didn't seem quite right so I measured them by filling with water and came up with these capacities:2 cup, 4 cup, 6 cup, 10 cup and 16 cup.So the largest bowl is about 1/2 the capacity of the size specified in the description! Well, I didn't really have room for the large one anyway (in my tiny NYC kitchen), but hey guys, that's not right. Fix it.The bowls do have a wider and shallower profile than the typical mixing bowl, but I think that actually works to their advantage, making stirring and mixing easier and more thorough. And they don't have that annoying ridge an inch down from the rim that some others do. The rim has a nice smooth curl to it, so pouring is easy to control. I like them.But fix that description, fellows, before somebody gets hurt."
3,The first real writer after Pinochet,"People on the prowl, first published in Chile as Gente al acecho, is probably the best book among a great number of works by the ""Nuevos narradores chilenos"". They had in common to publish near after democracy's return, but Collyer was the first who could write over these situations, giving us a book with no bitterness, a great amount of irony and humour."
1,Hi!,"Yo, I hate the band N'SUCK and I really don't want you to buy this cd. After reading the review stating what you REALLY get (it actually helped me), I have come to the conclusion that I needed to write a bad review (since for some reason this cd has no bad reviws and hardly any reviews, so I thought if I wrote a bad review, the overall score would acually go down *evil laugh*, because N'SUNC cds don't deserve overall ratings of 5). Moving on, I have no idea why anyone would purchase an interview cd. WHF?! Yea, dude, just chillin', listening to N'SUCK answer lame question where I don't really care about their answer, I just wanna hear their HOT voices, ohhhhhh! And who wants to listen to ""Tearin' Up My Heart"" I couls write MUCH better lyrics then that, folks, they say you WAY too much. If you really like the song, safe your money and watch the (very funny) Clueless episode where N'SUCK sing at that girls birthday party (I havn't watched Clueless in a LONG time). PEACE OUT!"
4,Excellent reference for cat owners,"This is an excellent reference if you're a cat owner who wants to know more than the vet tells you. If you're like me, I ask a lot of questions, but busy vets don't always have the time to answer all of my questions. This book covers a lot of information, and is especially helpful if you want to know ""why"" or ""how"" a disease or condition occurs. I've gained a much better understanding of feline vaccines, parasites, viruses, etc. However, there's not much information on the medications used to treat the diseases in the book, and I'm still looking for a book with this kind of information in it. This book is fairly technical, so I would not recommend it for the average consumer. But that's why I like it!"
3,"Frankly, pretty disappointing.","This book came highly recommended by several authors I respect, but I wasn't thrilled with the quality. Several sections seem to gloss over the topics they cover, and even the supposedly revised version has some outdated information. There's a lot of useful information in this book, but I have a feeling there's a smaller, better written book inside struggling to get out."
3,"I agree, not enough detail, need supplements","My vet highly recommended this book, but I also found it to not have details for me when I looked up ailments my cat has. Also not very helful for owners to look up symptoms. It is comprehensive on the anatomy and diseases of the cat, but it reads like an intro text book and not an owner's guide. I would choose another book with more detail on the conditions and general care."
3,A bit too complicated,Very detailed information. But a bit difficult to use for the average cat lovers. Symptom flow charts would be a great addition to the book
3,A useful whole systems view of organisational processes,"One of a range of books taking a whole systems view of the structures and processes required for lasting success. Explores non-hierarchical structures internally and whole supply chain relationships externally. It offers a practical approach, without falling into simplistic 'seven steps' solutions."
1,Is she serious? Is she institutionalized yet?,"After listening to Bush trip over too many one-syllable words, one could wax mighty nostalgic about the Clinton years."
1,Too much leaning,"While making convincing arguments in her book about how Bill Clinton should have been held accountable for his wrongdoing, she let too much of her own conservative prejudice show in this book. While making her point, she seemed to be defending Richard Nixon and I felt she was trying to be an advocate in his defense. It would have been more convincing if she had spent her time simply laying out the case against Clinton and left it at that. After all, her book did say it was the case against Bill Clinton.I couldn't get past the first few chapters. I kept thinking it would get better, but it didn't. I tried to get through the entire book and did a pretty good job. I had to quit at Chapter 18; Wampumgate. Her writing sytle is too much like her talking style - going off on tangents and making side comments referencing to other parts of the book. It all go too confusing and seemed to ramble at times. I will not be buying any more Ann Coulter books and I pity anyone who does."
1,Trash and hypocrisy,"I'm sorry, but when you have a book that tries to say that liberals have been wrong about everything in the past half century while obstensibly covering the Clinton impeachment saga, you carry ""partisan politics"" to a whole new level.Liberals have been wrong about everything in the past 50 years? I suppose that includes the civil rights movement, vietnam war protests and the indictment of our worst domestic president ever, ""I am not a crook"" Nixon?Ms. Coulter takes name calling to a whole new level (""we need to physically intimidate liberals... or they will all turn traitors"") while pretending that liberals love to call other people names. Nice job on the self-rightoues idiocy, senora Coulter."
5,Absolutely fantastic !!!,"Ann Coulter really socks it to Bubba! In addition to reminding the reader of all the sleaze that has oozed from the White House since 1993, she provides the historical context (i.e., Watergate) that demands the expulsion of our esteemed President. This should be required reading for American History 101 in every college in the U.S.A."
4,Very readable and compelling,"Interesting that all the negative reviewers make it clear they dislike anyone who criticizes the president. I thought her arguments were compelling. Especially telling was the section where she compares Clinton's felonies to the 'crimes' of Richard Nixon. No contest - and any American who believes Nixon was truly bad for the country must hold Clinton to this same standard. And they must also conclude that Clinton has done far more damage to America. Look at the facts, and read it with an open mind.Four stars because it is brilliant but could have benefitted from some tighter editing. In my opinion it doesn't detract from the central case, and many books written on topical issues are hurriedly done."
1,I wish I could give this book 0 stars...laughable hysteria,"This book is a regurgitation of lies, speculation and fiction created by those who couldn't, or wouldn't admit that our country was far better of under Clinton than the moral men of ""Ronald Reagan and George Bush"". Maybe Clinton was unfaithful to his wife...that is between the two of them....is that ""crime"" compared to selling guns to rebels, etc...all this book ""proves"" is that far right employs better spin masters than any other group in this country."
3,Book Cover Needs to be Improved,"Please Ann, enough about Bill Clinton! He has been out of office for almost four years. Isn't there another topic more important to talk about?"
1,Too Bad It's Full of Lies. The Treason Right Is Over. They Better Get Over a Blow job,"Too bad. Iran-contra, the Iraq war, outting the CIA, spying on Americans, Jack Abramoff, please.... the list goes on and on. The right wing has failed, and Clinton was the best thing that happened to the country in the last 30 years. Everyone has finally awakened to that reality. $9 trillion in debt and counting. Good going right wing nutjobs! Ken Starr's report found nothing. All the lies that right was passing were in their twisted sick little heads. They spent more on that investigation than investigating 9/11, a crime which happened on their watch. Perhaps if they got off of the soap operas, this country wouldn't be in the mess that it's in now."
5,A well organized and thoroughly documented account.,I found Ms. Coulter's book to be a surprisingly easy read. Each chapter peels away a little more of the onion and until it finally arrives at its rotten core. Her analysis of the Constitution was most enlightening. I particularly liked her inclusion of the comments from the Federalist Papers and of our founding fathers.
5,THERE IS MORE TO THE CLINTONS THAN BREAKING THE LAW,"In light of the fact that Bill Clinton wants to be Secretary-General of a more powerful U.N. while Hillary Clinton is in an ""internationalized"" White House, one is struck by the uncomfortable notion that the battle of Good vs. Evil is not relegated strictly to the War on Terrorism. There may be a reason why a real Christian like George Bush is President. Are we facing a confrontation between supernatural forces, an Apocalypse? If so, are the Clintons part of it or are conservative Christians just ranting about nothing? Do we really want to set us ourselves up for the worst? America - the world - beware of the Clintons. Do not give them power.STEVEN TRAVERSAuthor of ""Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman""STWRITES@aol.com"
2,Big disappointment.,"While the topic is timely and I looked forward to some enlightenment on it, this book turned out to be a partisan screed thinly disguised as a legal argument. The argument is sloppy, excitable and full of hyperbole. The historical context is selective and incomplete.... Don't waste your money."
3,YELLOW JOURNALISM OR LIBEL,"Ms. Coulter is seizing the Leo-Straussianism wave that have come upon America to make big bucks. Poor research, poor work. She could be a good lawyer by the way she manipulates the truth but at the same time her case can be easilly destroyed by someone with time to research. Then after loosing her case she would write another sizzing book to mislead the American public.No wonder Al Franken called her a liar."
1,Job Offer,"Ann, instead of writing hypocritical slander, why not do porn? The money's better and you could finally put that body to good use. After all your mind isnt producing anything worth buying."
2,Good and bad,"I'll keep it short, there are enough reviews already:Good - bashes Billy Boy. Bad - Coulter whines worst than my 3 year old. My advice? Skip this and just listen to Rush. Coulter doesn't have anything new to say, and she is so annoying that you wouldn't want to read her if she did. Can we give her to the liberals?"
5,"Thanks for the Facts, Ma'am.","I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It is refreshing to know that there are still journalists who care about what is actually true, and what the facts are concerning our Mis-leader. Ms. Coulter has written the best Clinton expose yet, no small feat! Thank you, Ann."
5,Ann has what it takes!,Finally a lawyer who can tell the truth! I loved this book and can't wait until she readies her pen and aims her sights at her next target...St. Hilary!
3,ok,"I am no fan of William Clinton, his nasty wife, or any of his staff. This was a good book. I love to read about scandalous activities and this was no disapointment."
5,Case Closed,"Can you carry on a cocktail party conversation regarding Whitewater? Do you have any idea what the underlying charges were in Filegate? Travelgate?Do you believe that the impeachment investigation was justified?If you answered no to any of the above, YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK. If you want an account of the Clinton Administration scandals without the conventional hyperbole and political spin, READ THIS BOOK.Ann Coulter, often accused of being a ""Clinton Hater"" by Democrats, cogently supports her conclusions with an abundance of facts and law (ironically UNLIKE the arguments of her political opponents). Amidst a tone that is notably humorous and bitingly sarcastic, High Crimes is concise, readable and highly entertaining.This book is an absolute must-read for anyone that desires a broader perspective regarding the Clinton Administration."
1,Completely partisan and illogical,"The book was very poorly written and can only appeal to those who have long since made up thier minds about the issue and want to read something that confirms their worst beliefs about Clinton.It will not shed any useful light on the subject for those looking for a reasoned argument. Her vitriol comes through on almost every page and, therefore her book is of little value accept as grist for the ""true believers."""
1,Morality from the Right?,"Ann Coulter gives reasons just why the issues of character and the private lives of presidents should remain a high standard in our choices for leaders. It's interesting to note that she does not hold the Republicans to the same moral standard. In my book, lying that sends thousands to their death and costs the public billions of dollars is far worse than lying to save your marriage. As for character before office... a Rhoads scholar versus a drunkard, a theif and a illegal drug user. Try reading Worse Than Watergate by John Dean."
1,Another psychotic ramble,Listen to Ann Coulter talk and you wonder why she isn't taking her medication. Buy one of her books and you've just joined a pschotic nut group.Ann Coulter must be irritated because she could never get Clinton alone. Or maybe it's just that she keeps writing this insane screeds because there's a hard core of nuts who will buy anything that vents their anger.Not worth one star and a waste of money.
1,Elitist Bunk,A book that only an conservative elitist like Coulter could write. And a book that only those who think that Fox News tells the truth could buy.
4,Mr. Smooth!,"I wasn't as familiar with Matt Monro's recordings before I purchased this CD, other than his rendition of ""From Russia With Love"" from the James Bond film of the same name. However, that song is not on this album. It starts out with, ""There's Kind of Hush All Over The World"" and continues with many songs that were popular in the Fifties and Sixties, but given his own special treatment. All in all, this collection was such a wonderful surprise to me....His voice is smooth, warm and clear. Perfect for relaxing and daydreaming!"
1,"Cheap, not just in price...",The surface finish started flaking off in about 1 week... No interesting features either...
3,Can't figure out how to put the time in 12 hour format.,"The price is good, the style is good, the material is good but the instructions on how to set it up is just to complicated. Can't find how to set the time to 12 hour format."
2,atomic enterprises review,"When I received the model I ordered, the package was squashed flat. Since it is a Christmas gift, I didn't open it to see if the parts are broken. The model was sent in a brown bubble envelope. I paid $6.99 shipping so the seller should have sent it in a box to prevent damage. I will NEVER purchase from this seller again."
5,One of the best of its kind.,A superb analysis of the genesis of neuroses with practical suggestions toward enlightenment. I recommend this book highly.
1,Bad memory: computer freezes,"I ordered one strip of Viking DL1356 512MB for my Dell Inspiron 600m, the machine that this memory model is supposedly designed for. The DL1356 memory continuously freezes my computer. I even tried having the DL1356 installed without any other memory strips; still froze my computer.I should have trusted the_verdugo's review."
2,Not much range,"I'm not sure how this headset compares to others on the market but the phone has to be very close to the headset. The product description said it has a 30 foot range. Not mine. However, the battery life is really good and it is very handy to have in the car."
2,Returned mine,"It took only a few phone calls for me to realize that there is major static issues with this headset. Connectivity was not a problem at all. My phone (Samsung) had to be in a specific spot for me to have clear reception, not something I found acceptable.I bought the Plantronics 510 and it's like night and day. This is a GREAT GREAT headset in my opinion. Sure it's not as discreet as the 320 but it's ultra clear, comfortable, connects well, and I can be talking on the streets of NYC and nobody can tell because of the Noise Cancelling mic."
2,OK overall but too much static,"I'm overall pleased with the unit, but will return/exchange it for a replacement 320 in case I got a bum unit. The popcorn static is very noticeable even at close range with my Nokia 6255i. I have static even with the unit at the same side as the cell phone hooked on to my belt."
2,"Good sound, poor design","No defect in the product's communication function, just in the design. The over-the-ear hook is too thick to share space with my glasses and made my ear sore. The function button is too small and very fiddly - hard to press without jamming the speaker even further into my ear, which brings me to the third problem: The protruding speaker pushed the tragus forward and made it sore too. One positive: The people on the other end of the line said the sound quality of this headset was better than the Motorola 500 I've been using. They'll just have to get over it, because I can't deal with a sore ear."
5,Excelent battery life.,This device has surpased all my expectations. My main concern was the battery life and this device ROCKS! It holds up to its specifications of having 8 hours of talk time and more than 4 days of standby.
2,"Nice Secure Fit on my Ear, BUT.....","...This Plantronics Explorer 320 has TOO MUCH static & very little range. The annoying static occurs even when I have the phone on my hip, and you can't walk from room to room without the interference getting loud. The volume is also VERY LOW..I had to yell and repeat things 2-3 times to my caller, who also complained about a bad connection. This Plantronics Explorer 320 was priced better than the ill-fitting Motorola H500, so I gave it a try, and was pleased with the quick pairing, and secure fit on my ear, but the static was too much to bear...alas, I'm returning this to Best Buy ASAP, and sticking with my wired earpiece from Jabra, which is quite dependable. All in all, I've tried to use 7 different Bluetooth units, and they aren't worth the high cost. I'd recommend that buyers get a wired unit or prepare to enjoy static & bad reception with this Plantronics Explorer 320.NEXT..."
2,Irritating to your caller,"As I talk to my wife on the Plantronics Explorer 320 she is quite happy -- she hears me fine. The problem is for me (the caller). As I talk to her, every time I open my mouth and speak I hear loud static feedback coming to the ear of my own phone. It is very irritating -- stopping with each breath I take.The phone is also possibly useless around other 2.4Ghz equipment in your home such as cordless phones, video baby monitors, WiFi, etc."
4,Great sound,"I can't quite give this one a 5, but only because the voice dialing is a little hit and miss. This may be more a reflection on my SE 520a than on the headset though. Otherwise, sounds great! I don't even keep it turned all the way up, because that is TOO loud. I do notice a little bit of crack/hiss if I am near a wifi transmitter, but only if I am within about 15 feet of it.Comfort is fine for me, but I have not worn it for more than 3 hours continuously yet. I wear glasses, and this headeset is fitting just fine.I think it feels very secure on my ear, and, unlike my old headset, I have never once had an urge to make a phantom grab at what feels like a slipping headset.Battery life is slightly less then stated specs, but close enough that I can't complain.Windy conditions are so-so, but I don't think any headset is going to work well through the Great Lake gusts we get here, so I can't complain about that.For the price, I am extremely happy with this headset."
1,Not really impressed,"This is my first experience with using a bluetooth headset. I've had my 320 now for 2 weeks and I don't like it. I love the idea of handsfree wireless, but I have to keep the phone so close to my headset that its almost pointless. While driving, I have to put the phone on my door's armrest or I'll lose signal. In my home office, I leave my phone on the desk, but if I move away, say to the printer 8 feet from my desk, I get really bad break up.I'm considering a return and perhaps replacing it. Meanwhile, I've started carrying my jabra wired headset and using it instead."
2,"Beastly uncomfortable, static and disconects from the phone",This was my first bluetooth headset. I bought it because it was relatively cheap and lightFirst the good: LOUD. I could get the volume loud enough to be uncomfortable. The volume is easily adjusted. Also the micraphone is clear and people said they could hear me very clearly.Now the bad: The head set would loose it's pairing with the phone frequently. This of course would require re-pairing it. Not a burdensom thing but a bit of a bother.(I have never had to re-pair with the headset that replaced this one)There is a great deal of static that I do not experiance with the replacement head set.IT HURTS THE EAR. The part that fits in ot the ear is large and hard edged and after about a 1/2 an hour it starts to hurt. There is no option fro a smaller piece and it is quite hard. It was this that prompted me to replace the head set finally.All this by the way is with the same cell phone so it is a good one to one comparison.
2,Not at all worth buying!!!,I had ordered this item from Amazon.com...and looking at its sleek design was quite impressed at first.But the product was way below its expectations and I had to return the device in 2 days.Cons: The device does not have a clear indicator when its charging is complete.There is a lot of interference even if your cell phone is located quite close to the device.The sound quality is not that good either.
3,bad bad amazon,"Today I received this headset from amazon. To my utter dismay apon opening the box and pulling the non-retail headset out of its plastic taped up bag, I could cleary see that this headset was someone elses return. Pulling it out of the plastic I first noticed the visable earwax still on the ear piece and turning it over to discover the power on/volume button to be busted in half and inoperable. Very upset with amazon that they would send out a previoulsy used product to someone that trusted them to send ""new"" since I ordered ""new"". Hopefully my replacement will get a much better review as im not blaming plantronics for this."
1,Total Junk!,"I typically never write reviews. But I guess I've never been so dissapointed in a purchae before. The item first arrived in Bulk packaging, the item description is EXTREMELLY misleading!!!Straight to the point, the headset arrived and the microphone did not work. I could hear out of it but it could not pick up my voice or any noise for that matter. Returning the item for a REFUND ASAP!Not only was the product defective but Amazon has deliberately mislead me into believing i was getting a fully packaged item. Instead I get bulk packaged junk."
4,pretty good product,"this product works well, easy to pair up with my LG CU500 cell phone. you have to speak up when using this though, as people tend to complain that they can't hear me well.the product looks good and feels comfortable when wearing it.highly recommended."
4,Excellent,"Highs: Very comfy, good sound quality, simple & easy to use, great priceLows: Arm can crack, lacks featuresBottom Line: If you don't care about features, this bluetooth headset is a steal for $30."
4,Better then expected,"Good functionality, strong signal strength. I don't like that it has a seperate charger then any other device I have. Seems to hold a strong charge though once fully charged."
2,Would look at somthing else,"The constant hissing, echo and background noise made it almost impossible to carry on a conversation. If there were any kind ambient noise on the other end, it would completely overpower the other person's voice. I would end up shutting the headset and talking directly into the phone.I had this product for a week and sent it back"
2,it's ok,it is very comfortable but there's too much static. i used it with a treo 650 and what the other reviews say about the static is true. i returned it to amazon. if only there was no static when on a call it would be a much better headset.
4,Good for the money - older technology,"This is a good unit for any non-business or non-heavy user. I've had this headset for many years, but stopped using it years ago because of the inconsistent connections. With California's new hands free law, I've started using it again, but the periodic drops or bad connections were not acceptable for business use. When it connects and keeps the connection, this is a very good unit with above average sound and voice quality. Good connections are about 75-80% of the time.Fit is excellent so I'm sticking with plantronics on my next headset."
3,Easy to use. Sound quality is not too good,"It is cheap. I loose my BT headset all the time. So, cheap is a plus. Reception is not that good and sound quality is not perfect. For the price, it is pretty ok."
3,Inconsistent compatability,"I had misplaced my other Plantronics 3XX Bluetooth Headset and ordered this one since it looked similar to the one that I really liked. Unfortunately, this headset would not consistently stay connected to my phone. Often, I would be talking on the headset then without warning my call would be on the speakerphone. (This occured when my headset was fully charge.) When I would attempt to reconnect to the headset my phone would state either there were no bluetooth devices detected or my phone would pick up other bluetooth devices in other people's vehicles (but not this one that was sitting beside my phone). On rare occations, the Plantronics 320 Bluetooth Headset would work fine, therefore I did not send it back for a full refund."
4,Good Product,"I've never had any problems with this Bluetooth Headset, contrary to the belief that it's full of static. The only time I hear any static at all is when the volume is up all the way and even then the sound quality is still present. It's a great buy for the money."
3,It might work for you,"I purchased this device due to my long drive times. I'm that crazy person you see going 80 miles an hour, blabbing on the phone. So I decided I would make an attempt at responsible driving. The sound quality is fairly good. It is easy to adjust and light to carry. The only problem I can see is that a small portion of the microphone fits into your ear. If it doesn't fit the shape of your ear (as in my case), it becomes very uncomfortable. It is worth trying if you are on a tight budget, but don't forget to check the return policy."
3,OK for the money...,"I am using this headset with the Chocolate phone from verizon wireless. For the money, the headset is a good choice:PROS:1. Stays in place.2. Easy to use.3. Good sound if phone is witin 10 feet.4. Good battery life with average usage.5. Charging is easy and quick.CONS:1. Even though the fit is good, with extended wearage, the headset pinches the back of my ear.2. Sound quality diminishes with distances greater than 10 feet."
3,Rise and fall of a good headset,"Pros:-Great battery life-Excellent price-Good fit-Lightweight-Sleek look is not flashy nor bland-Quick connectivity to multiple equipments (Motorola, LG, Nokia)Med:-Ambient/Backgroun noise isolation could improve. Nevertheless, volume compensated for noiseCons:-Some interference-Ear loop joint is weak, brittle. After a couple of months, the hinge pin from the one I bought felt loose and eventually the plastic broke, making the headset un-useable. Still need to contact Plantronics and Amazon to see their response and action plan."
2,Too Much Freakin Static,"I returned the Motorola device because it practically fell off of my ear. The Plantronics 320 stays put very well, but there is entirely too much static for me to forgo the $60 price tag. Set-up and pairing with the Treo 650 was very easy, but there's just way too much static. It seems that it doesn't matter if I put my Treo on the same side as the earpiece or have it in my hand held up to my ear, there's still static."
3,Good but could be better,"The headset is comfortable and lightweight. Pairing with my Blackberry 8700C was easy. The only complaint I have is that you hear a considerable amount of static if the headset and the phone aren't in unobstructed, close proximity to one another. If I put the phone in my pocket I'll get static, but when I take it out and hold it, the static goes away. Worth it for the money, but if you plan on stashing the phone in a pocket or purse while talking, look elsewhere."
1,Bluetooth Headset,"The headset I recieved does not match the one pictured in the sale. I got one with a boom microphone, and the picture shows one without."
2,Static Reception in Headset,"I bought this phone with my PPC-6700. Since this was my first bluetooth phone, I was patient with the accidental hangups and inadvertent calling of people as I stumbled with the one button.Nevertheless, I became used to the devices. Yet, the headset did not provide clear reception. I noticed that callers sounded as if they were coming through a cheap AM radio. Whenever I walked away from my phone (yet less than 30 feet), the static was terrible. I returned it after eight days and I have a Jabra 150. Hopefully, that will work better."
4,plantronics bluetooth headset,"well its my first one and its ok for a normal use if your interested in sound quality,but otherwise its good."
1,Totally Useless,"This phone looks good on paper with its long battery life but in actuality is horrible for the average user of bluetooth headsets. The sound quality is quite poor with horrible speech lag resulting in a continuous echo. It will not work effectively in louder than an empty room situations and the range is limited to approximately than 10 feet.I wanted to use if for Skype calls with my MAC but because of its poor quality for both the computer and phones, I am searching for another one.Although it is light, people want a headset that works. This is not that headset."
3,Plantronics,"I like the price, like the headset but am disappointed in how often I have to reconnect to it."
4,A good product,"I have not tried many other headsets, but I am confident in saying that this is a good product."
3,it's ok but nothing special,"it seems to work o.k. but when I use it in my car, with the window open, callers complain that they can't hear me. For inside use, it's fine."
3,Almost fed up with bluetooth technology,"I purchased this device after my wife marveled over it. She lives in a metropolis area and I'm constantly traveling and maybe that has something to do with it. There are times when she's using her headset and I'm not able to tell. I got one after being disappointed with the Motorola 500. The Explorer 320 is considerably more comfortable and definitely remains on the ear while doing normal activities. Like some of the other reviews, there is static if there is any interference between the earpiece and phone. I'm not searching for perfection, I just want a good product."
2,No thanks,Ive given up on using over the ear hands free devices. As I look around it seems a lot of others have to. Great idea but the poor fit and the road and wind noise finally made me switch to a over the visor in car hands free unit I bought at Walmart. No more problems and works every time.
4,Nice,"Was a little bigger than I expected, but still very nice. Being able to switch from either side is a bonus.Fast shipment and recommended."
2,"It could've been my phone, but I ordered the model that supposidly matched, and it won't sync.","It could've been my phone, but I ordered the model that supposidly matched, and it won't sync.It does read but no connection."
1,UK charger,I have no idea if the unit even works because I can't charge it. It came with a charger for a British outlet. It even came with a converter but it converts it from one British plug (the two slanted prongs) to another British plug (the two thin round prongs). So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.
5,best plantronics exploer 320 bluetooth,this product is great best one i have ever bought sence bluetooths came out really clear no joke it is the best. patrick
3,Value for money,"Decent headset - Light, reasonably comfortable, very clear.Range not as good as expected, but suited my needs for hands free in the car and within a 15X15 office.- overall quite good except for the volume control whichhas minimal effect, if any, on the volume!"
2,Sound Quality Not Good,"I returned 2 of these because the people my wife and I called couldn't hear us at all, although we could hear them perfectly. The people we called said it sounded like we were driving with our head sticking out of the window of the car. It picks up every little noise in the car like road noise, the fan, anything from the radio. If we turned everything off, no windows open, people said the sound was better, but still could hear a lot of background noise. If you plan on using this in a sound-proof room, it should work great. Otherwise, I don't recommend it if you want to use it in the car."
4,"Takes a licking, but keeps on ticking...","This little bluetooth headset has decent reception. I have occasionally gotten complaints from the person I'm talking to that the volume gets faint. But the headset is pretty good for under $30.The amazing thing is that I have forgotten it in my pants pocket and it has gone to the wash twice already. It still works. There might be a little more static, but it still works. I think that in both cases, the headset was off before the water ever hit it. Each time I've discovered it in the clothes washer, I would let it dry out for a few days in a pill bottle stuffed with several silica get packs before ever turning it on.In both cases, I discovered the head set as I was getting clothes out of the wash. I'm not able to comment on whether it can still continue working after a trip thru the clothes dryer. If I should have the misfortune of putting the headset thru the clothes dryer, I will certainly post an update."
3,"I wanted to love it, but don't","Great size. Good fit. Comfortable. Easy to setup. Quick to turn on. But I couldn't adjust to hearing the static when I'm on a call. I don't think this will bug everyone, but I guess I am sensitive to noise. People could hear me ok. I just bought the 510 and we'll see how it goes. The 510 is A LOT larger and seems more combersome. I think it was designed with men, not women in mind. I'd recommend the 310 if the white noise won't bother you."
5,Plantonics 320 Bluetooth Headset,Originally chose the Motorola HS850 headset but found the volume too low even at its highest setting. Switched to the Plantronics 320 at a much lower price and found the volume loud enough in even noisy settings. The Bluetooth interface works well with my Nokia cellphone.
1,Not so good for me,I used it for about two months and the mike began to fail. I would connect it to my phone and then make a call and the person on the other end would hear nothing I said. This happend more frequently over a period of about a month until I gave up on it.
5,Works as advertised,"I mainly use this headset when I'm driving. I have used it on an old Nokia 6310i and a Motorola A1200 and it works fine. The only drawback (which is mentioned in the manual) is that your phone and the headset should be on the same side if you want to experience the best reception.This is not a problem as I usually rest my phone in a tray, close to the headset. The headset also plays my custom ringtones, so I have an idea who's calling before I answer. The battery life is great, the reception is great and it's not a problem to have it in my ear for long periods.So, I would recommend this product to anyone interested in a nice, light bluetooth headset."
3,It's not a bad bluetooth device,"I read the reviews here and ended up buying this bluetooth device. After pairing it up with my phone, I ended up using while my phone was clipped to my belt. I got static, even if I move my phone I get static. I need to have the phone in front of me before I can use this bluetooth and not get static. Other than the static it's a nice bluetooth."
2,Worked great for 4 months. Then static-city.,"Bought the Plantronics Explorer 320 back in October of 2006. Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver). In January of 2007, the headset stopped working as I was making a call. I turned off the headset and powered back up. It continued to be paired with my Treo, yet, the call was filled with too much static (for both callers) to be functional. I took the headset home and tried it with my PC and Skype. Same problem. I was very happy with the headset at first. Clearly Plantronics has a defective product on their hands - I am not the only one to have this problem. Be wary of others giving this headset high marks: it may only be a matter of time before they have problems too."
3,sound not good enough,"A lot of people say this item is very nice, but my experience is not that good. The one I got has a kind of distant firework sound when you make phone calls, and the signal is not good enough even with the promised range."
4,Explorer 320,I have this headset paired with a LV VX8300 on Verizon Wireless. It works very well. I like the one button control and it's comfortable too. Good bang for the buck.
2,Poor Distance with Treo 700W,I am using this product with my Treo 700W. The battery life is good and the sound quality is good - up to 2 feet from the phone. I chatted with Plantronics support who informed me that they have trouble with all their headsets with the Treo 700W and their is not a solution. I would not recommend this headset if you have a 700W.
4,You can't beat it for this price.,"The headset is a little uncomfortable, but not unbearable. The range of the device does not meet typical bluetooth standards. I would say that 5 feet is about the maximum range and for my purposes that is fine. The battery life is superb. This is a great product for someone who would like to try a simple easy to use wireless headset for cheap. No bells or whistles."
4,"Works very well, but don't let anything get between it and the phone","I bought this for myself and a cardo scala 500 for my wife.This Plantronics 320 connects within a second or two every time, as opposed to the scala which takes 2-4 seconds.The sound quality is good, both ways.The reception is good, as well, but if there's anything between the headset and the phone, you'll start to hear static. When driving, for instance, if the phone is on the dashboard, the sound should be clear. If it's in your pocket and you're holding a briefcase, expect some static unless you happen to have it on the ear on the same side as the pocket the phone is in. The Scala will, on the other hand, usually, work through walls with no static at all.It's a good headset, and it fits well and transfers from one ear to the other in a snap, but its range is certainly a bit limited."
1,There's a reason why it is cheap,"I purchased this headset when I bought my first bluetooth enabled phone. It is light weight and the buttons are very easy to use while you have the headset on. Unfortunately (like the other reviews have pointed out), this headset does have a lot of static unless the phone less than two feet away and has a direct line of sight. I started getting static even if I had my phone on a belt clip but covered by my jacket. After one week the hinge on the ear piece broke, so I returned it and got another Plantronics 510 (which I like much better)Bottme line...Don't waste your money on this model"
3,"OK,not the best","I have used this headset for long periods(3+ hrs.) on several occassions.Overall, good quality.Here are the problems;1)Hard to hear in a noisy highway environment (in heavy traffic)2)Hurts the ear if worn for long periods.3) Sometimes hard to hear other party, if they speak up tends to take care of problem.I have used other bluetooth products and this is one of the better ones."
3,Just Okay,"Easy To use, not really visally appealing, but works as it should, if you are looking for a basic no nonsense bluetooth headset, this will work for you. If you are a techno junkie this is not your cup of tea."
4,It is great to be hands free.,It works pretty good and I can walk away from my phone and it is still clear. It does become a bit uncomfortable on the ear with long periods of wear.
5,"The Flash, the fastest man alive... In fiction...","The pilot for the Flash was aired a long time ago on one of local tv station in my country (Yes, I am not from the state), and I was drawn in into this terrific tale of crime fighting masked vigilante in the form a crimson speedster.That was my first actual introduction of the Flash. Before that, the only super heroes from DC that I've known were of course Superman and Batman. But I find the Flash much more fascinating because of his expertise in 'speed', and of course he being just a man unlike the ""Man Of Steel"". I find the series much more delightful than ""Lois and Clark"" that was aired during the same period (locally), it's a pity that it ended so soon...I have no regret buying the complete series for The Flash. It had being one of my saved items for quite a while now, and with a charming price of 15 plus dollars, who could resists and not to mention that a movie adaptation of The Flash will finally come out soon."
5,Finally! I can't wait!,"It's been a while since I've seen this fun show so watching it again after all these years is gonna be a blast from the past. All I remember is the cool suit, the flash special effects, and of course Amanda Pays (yum). Anyways, it's gonna be interesting to see if any memories will flood back once I start watching."
4,In A FLASH,"Having remember is series and now viewing the DVD's I realized I missed alot of the series when it first aired. In comparison to today's CGI technology, the show was well done for the small screen at the time. Central City on a whole was not as dark as Gotham City or as Bright as Metropolis. Campy but not like Adam West's Batman. Wonder what it would be like if the show were done by todays standards."
3,lost but not forgotten,"It interesting how they handled this comic book character for the TV. Some of the first episodes are not the best, but it definitely gets better. It looked liked they spent a lot of money on the production of this series, its to bad it didn't continue past the first season, it would have been fun to see more episodes."
2,"I love the Flash, but this DVD set STINKS","NO special features, NO clean up of the Picture, NO clean up of the sound, NOTHING. This DVD is 1 step up from owning the series on VHS. Everything with this set feels like it was hated from the moment of production.What I don't understand is why it costs so much for this set. I could've done most of this DVD on my home computer and had better quality. It's REALLY sad to see that The Greastest American Hero actually looks BETTER than the Flash given that TGAH is almost a full 10 years BEHIND it.Still, if you're looking for The Flash, get it. I seriously doubt WB will reproduce it."
3,"Great series, but flawed","If you're a comic book enthusiast, this is a must have for your collection. A good adaptation. It would be perfect if the packaging itself wasn't flawed. One of the discs continues to fall out."
3,"Cut past the cheese, and the rest is smooth sailing","Sure, the set was pretty bare-bones (seriously, would it have killed them to cobble together a interview segment with the cast and crew looking back on the show, or dig up some behind-the-scenes footage, or even throw in a single commentary track?), and some of the earlier episodes were somewhat cornier than I remembered, but the show definitely picked up speed (pardon the pun) pretty quickly. In fact, one episode in particular, ""Beat the Clock"", was a surprisingly good dramatic story, and even featured a young Angela Basset. (There's also the fun of spotting actors who became famous much later in their careers. For instance, both Brian Cranston and Jonathan Brandis were featured in episodes, and Gloria Reuben and Jeri Ryan both had cameos.) All in all, it's defintely worth owning, in my opinion."
5,Loved it!,Too bad that bad time slots killed this series. It never really got the chance to take off.
4,A wonderful classic,"I LOVED this show when it was on! I thought John Wesley Shipp and Amanda Pays were terrific! Unfortunately, I think it was a tad too ""campy"" for most people - even back in 1990. Thus, it only lasted one season.I picked this up as soon as it came out and I love it! The episode with Mark Hamill as the Trickster is exceptional. One can easily see how this character might have led to his recurring voice-work as the Joker on the Batman Animated series.The other thing I had completely forgotten about this show that I really dig, though, is all the classic cars! They went for a sort of new world/old world style to the sets and there are TONS of gorgeous classic cars all over the place!This show was a classic and it provides a fond rememberance of life in the early '90's."
4,The Flash - The Complete Series..........,"Out of all of DC's stable of characters, one of my all-time favorites was and still is The Flash. When this show originally aired on CBS, I quickly became a fan and watched the show everytime I caught it on the air. Thing is, the show only ran for one season. I believe that, had this show lasted a couple of seasons, it would've gained more of a following..much like shows like Wonder Woman and The Incredible Hulk did. The Flash was a pretty good show with the right amount of humor & seriousness that stayed closer to the roots of the comics than any other show had. Like those shows, much of the season's stories involved mobsters and the like yet, towards the end of the season, villains from Flash's rogue's gallery showed up."
4,The Flash - The Complete Series,its a good series to bad they never finished it offit ends weried but you'll love when he gets hit by lightning
3,Flashy but lacking,My biggest gripe about the DVD's was the complete lack of ANY special features. Not even a short commentary. The series is as fun as I remembered it being. The lack of even the most basic of special features cost this a solid star. (IE 4 Stars) instead of 3.
3,There are still DVDs with problems,I ordered the DVD set to watch this weekend. It still has the problem of freezing at the end of the pilot episode. I tested the DVD in 2 DVD players and a computer DVD drive. I am contacting Amazon and I expect them to provide for return shipping since this is a known problem.
5,Love this show,This is perhaps my favorite live action superhero TV show. I am so excited to see this show coming to DVD. I was so sad when it didn't return for a second season. I will definetly be picking this up when it comes out.
3,Defective Disk Too,Amazon has sent me a replacement copy of the disk set and the replacement appears to also be defective.The pilot episode chokes towards the end (you lose about 3 minutes of family closure). Annoying but at least most of the story is told.All the other disks appear to be fine.
1,"Awww, C'mon!!!","The other reviewers are correct. My disc also skipped and locked up right at the end of the Pilot Episode. I couldn't believe it! I thought only Universal had these types of problems, but apparently so does Warner Bros. These aren't even the problematic double-sided discs that Univeral has issues with--they're single-sided! On top of that, the picture quality is grainy VHS at best. No care whatsoever was taken in the transfer of this show to dvd. No extras, either. Zip. Nada. Shame too as I still like the show. Get with it Warner Bros, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves!!"
4,Beware !,"Altough an excellent set, the first disc has a fault in the first show, this disc should be replaced, so beware before you buy !"
4,Good stuff,"I bought this out of fond memories from high school when this was on TV. Well, it didn't age well, but that didn't make the DVDs any less fun. This is the Barry Allen Flash, and it's too bad CBS didn't give it a consistant time slot to build an audience. They spent a lot of money on it and then let it flop in the wind. At first, they didn't want super-villains, then they changed their mind. Basically, this series didn't have a chance.John Wesley Shipp does a good job as the Flash, and his supporting cast is pretty good, though Tina McGee's voice gets pretty annoying with her English accent after awhile.The highlights include the episodes with Nightshade, a former vigilante, and the ones with Mark Hamill as the Trickster. Hamill is even better as psychotic villains (see: the Joker in the Batman animated series) than he was as Luke Skywalker!"
1,Love the show...hate the dvd,"I am a huge fan of this show and was very excited to receive my set. Unfortunately, the pliot episode freezes near the end then skips to menu on all my DVD players. I can tolerate a bit of graininess in the picture but can't get past the defects."
5,dvds are SPEEDING off the shelves in a FLASH!,"lame headline, but i seriously had to go to 3 different stores before i got my copy, due to how in demand this is. heck, i only got it because the clerk felt bad that i had to go to 3 stores to locate it, and pulled his reserved copy out of the back for me. this set is white hot, and rightfully so. this was great television when i was growing up, and the stories are both nostalgic and fun as can be. you really really should get this!!!!! a wonderful series."
5,YES FINALLY!!,Finally one of the best superhero shows from the 90's is comming to us on DVD!! And its being released on the day after my birthday!! How awesome is that!? I have the piolt epsiode on VHS but I've so long wanted to own the entire show. And now I can!! I'm so excited I can't wait. I wish they hadn't cancled it and had let it contuine for a few more seasons. I thank my lucky stars for bringing this great show to DVD...god knows that it deserves this sort of treatment.
3,"Wow. The 90's were just not good, were they?","I collect ""superhero"" movies and shows. I needed this one as a representative of a DC comics hero on film.Hmmm.Not sure if ""needed"" is the correct term there.This whole thing just kind of sits there. Not really inspired, but not really sucking, either. It's as if they got to the point in the production of this where they felt like they weren't doing any harm to the comic book...and just stopped there. (Although, truth be told, they stopped a little late for that.) At times, it's embarrassing, and at times it's palatable. I just can't help thinking, ""Poor John Wesley Shipp. He had no idea how much harm he was doing to his career, did he? And not ONE of his friends told him! Sad, really. Just sad."" I can only wish that when he sees this today, he doesn't instinctively just curl up into a fetal ball and whimper endlessly..."
3,Good series.,"Only if you really like the super hero movies or t.v. shows would you really like this. It is an older show and takes awhile to get into the first episode, which is quite long. Might not be bad to give it a chance!"
5,This show should have ran 5 seasons!,"It's unbelievable that this show lasted one year. After being pre empted several times by sports and news events, I sometimes would see only half an episode, and catch the rest in a repeat. For the year it was on, we got to see some great super hero stories without the camp. John Wesley Shipp was great as the Flash and I hope that somehow this show gets put back on the air. It was one of the best shows of its time.It had all the major villians from the comics; Captain Cold, Mark Hamill's version of the Jester, a Joker like nemesis was the best two parter.I am hoping with the sale of this dvd set that somehow, some way this show will be revived!"
2,What the..?,"Remember that this series is over 15 years old now. Dated, and 1990 wasn't exactly ""The Nineties"" either, so this is basically a late 80's concocted Stab-In-The-Dark tv comic series. Think back, what did you see?Trust me, watching this now is not like watching it in 1990. The dated-ness feel, and cheesy 80's style character arcs are just unbearable for me. Granted, many STILL like it, so maybe this is just the other half talking.I love sci-fi, especially the comic book variety (GenX), and I think this just basically sucks. sorry fans.."
1,Gone in a flash.,"Okay where do I start? The series is too dark (not the characters, the lighting.), It all feels rushed and too influenced by the previous year's Batman success. The Flash is a good, bright character, nothing at all like Batman. And yet this series was clearly trying to be similar to Burton's original. Even Danny Elfman's theme tune sounds like a rehash of the Batman score. It does have it's moments, however. The feature length pilot is reasonably worth watching and Mark Hammil's guest appearences are hilarious. (Think cockknocker without the giant fist) But it mostly sucks. The costume is too padded, Wesley Shipp is miscast, his sidekicks are just annoying, I could go on and on.And with not one extra feature this boxset is for hardcore fans and collectors only. On the plus side, it only lasted one season."
4,Convenient,"I would give this product a 5 but Amazon recently raised the price $6. I have the hardest time finding this product on shelves, so it's so very convenient to buy on Amazon. I can't complain much because you do get free 2 day shipping if a member of the mom's club on Amazon."
5,Great Workbook!,I bought this workbook on advice from my counselor and I love it. My fiance and I dedicate 10-20 minutes to it whenever we get the time and have found it very useful in helping us to communicate even difficult situations. It has some great pointers and typically will start with a brief description of problem ways of communicating and how to remedy them. Then it has you complete short exercises to practice the skill they've just introduced. I would highly recommend - I think everyone could benefit from learning different ways to communicate more effectively.
1,Junky!,"This camera is by far the worst camera I have ever had. The flash is way way way too bright. I had to rig the flash to get it dimmer. The shutter has some type of delay. If you want a camera to get a quick picture of your kids when they are doing something cute, steer clear of this one! You get what you pay for!"
1,THE WORST DIGITAL CAMERA I HAVE EVER HAD,"I am not a professional photographer, or anything that resembles one, I am a mom that wants to take photos of everyday memories...this is a horrible camera for that. Or anything for that matter...THE FLASH IS WAAAAYYYY TOO BRIGHT. There is no way to change it, and I have absolutely never taken a good photo with this camera. It's awful & I do not recommend this camera for anyone, not even teenagers or children."
5,"Large, Plush & Adorable!","I received this black bear while I was in the hospital & it completely made my day! 30 inches may not sound like a lot, but, it makes this bear look quite big. He is very, very soft & I've even used him as a pillow and I instantly fell asleep! He is also the perfect length and size to lay across my lap, put my iPad on its back & do my work. I'm 27 years old & really fell in love with this bear. In fact, I'd love another 30-inch animal from this company!! I'd recommend this bear as a 'get well' gift for children or anyone older, or even as a 'just because' gift. I love the product & the seller & would recommend both!!"
5,Very cuddly bear,"This is a really soft and nice bear, and great to cuddle with. Two things to keep in mind: The claws really are surprisingly sharp (but you get used to it) and it sheds quite a bit. I'd definitely recommend it though :)"
3,Smaller than expected,"This bear is 30"" long only if you stretch out the tail and measure that too, and it's fairly narrow. Not what I expected from the photo, but it's still cute and soft, and seems well constructed."
3,"Soft bear, very sharp claws","This bear is very cute and very soft. However, they tried to make the claws too realistic. They feel more like stiff pieces of sharp cardboard instead of felt (and I think they are). My kids can't sleep with him because the claws poke them and could seriously damage an eye. Which is a shame because the bear is so soft and huggable."
1,it sucked,i bought this product for a girl. the ting says its 30 inches but really its only 3. i feel like i got ripped off.
5,Life in action,"Interesting how a man whose life reflected the turmoil of his day. As Solomon said, all is vanity. Comenius writes from many of his own experiences. He saw his family taken away from him, he had to flee numerous times. He basically invented modern education. Here is a book, written so long ago, yet so important for our day.Do we ever stop to ask why we do what we do and why we choose what we choose? Is there a better choice? Comenius was offered the Presidency of Harvard University in his day. Here is a man who survive, neigh, conquered in his life. You will be glad you read this book."
5,I'm Addicted!,"The orange-honey scent beyond discription. I tried a sample, thought it was too expensive, walked a block down the street, smelled my hand again and went back to buy the lotion:) I wish I could find more product in this area."
4,"Nice texture, too much fragrance","You may like the non-greasy texture of this pleasant, light hand lotion. But for a ""honey""-containing item, it has a strong fragrance that I found a little disconcerting."
3,Not Crazy About It,"Although this lotion works well and a little goes a long way, I'm just not diggin' the scent at all. I'm a lemongrass and verbena or any other fresh scent kind of gal. This smells, ummmm, kind of artificial or something. I just don't like the smell of it, but others apparently do."
2,just ok,There is fragrance in this and retinyl palmitate; I thought that it would have natural fragrance from essential oils but no. The fragrance is nothing like honey and orange and it smells artificial to me. I wish amazon would list all the ingredients. It is pretty expensive and the tube wasn't even sealed so I don't know if it has been used! Not worth the shipping price to send back.
4,Interesting topic,"This book brings case studies to light that deal with topic of only our bodies cease to exist, but our true selves continue on forever. The way it was presented left it up to the reader to decide their beliefs."
1,"Great, if you've got little to no common sense.",This is not a helpful tool for people who have a bachelors or higher. The book does not list if this man has his MSW or not.
3,ipod fm transmitter,"this product works...be aware, though, of the location of ur vehicle's radio antenna...my honda pilot antenna is in the rear side window -- about as far from the radio as u can get...as a result, the limited transmission power of this product struggles to deliver a static free signal...if the antenna is closer to the front of the vehicle, u'll love this product..."
5,Works Better than Other Models!,"I love this FM Transmitter! I had purchased it for my iPod nano and was thrilled about the clarity I found on quite a few FM stations. Recently, I got an iPod Touch 3G and was slightly disappointed to see that it will not charge the newer model. Still, the music transmits clearly though. This is a great product as far as the strength of the sound quality is concerned but use caution if you are looking for charging compatibility."
3,Same as the rest.,"This product is ok, especially for the cost. However, it is not as great as some reviewers make it out to be, at least not by my experience.No matter what I do, static will sometimes interfere with my music. I think this is more a function of the type of device and NOT the specific make/model. Anything that relies on FM radio will eventually receive interference.I do very much like the fact that it charges your ipod when not in use. I also like the scan feature that will find an available station for you to use, which I seem to use quite often while driving.I did follow the directions posted by other reviewers in an effort to circumvent the static issue, but found that this did not make much of a difference (if any at all).Overall, it is a fine product, just nothing especially better than several other products I have tried."
5,It works,I use this in my work truck to podcast talk radio mostly. The sound quality is pretty good. Of course its better than the am reception the show I podcast is on. I also listen to music and the quality is better than expected. You can tune almost the entire range of radio stations and it has 4 presets so as I move around the state I sometime change between two stations. I would buy this again and recommend to others.
4,Good purchase,"Good purchase. Brought it along many road trips and reception was clear most of the time. Not recommended for use in city driving. Almost never get a good signal due to radio waves crowding. However, this is still the next best thing for car stereos w/o an aux jack.Pros: Sleek design and layout, charges ipod, excellent for road tripsCons: Not for city driving use"
4,Easy set up,"Easy to set up. Works just fine, but I get alot of static. My radio in my car is kinda old, so that is why. I bought one for my friend who has a new car, and she gets no static at all. Depends on the quality of your stereo and antenna. Does NOT charge my 4th gen ipod nano. Does, however charge the 2nd gen ipod nano. Overall, a good product, and a good price."
4,Won't Charge Nano 4th!! Otherwise Works Great!,"The item description doesn't say that it won't charge my 4th generation Nano, which is a dissapointment, but the transmitter function still works great. I followed the instructions and found three stations in a row with static. I set the transmitter to the middle station and get crystal clear sound. After discovering this problem, I searched this item's reviews and see others have the same problem. I also found Iphone charging issues too (which I did not test), so Iphone owners should also search others' reviews."
2,It does not charge the new ipod collection,"It works very well as am fm transmitter, but the title is misleading- it does not charge the this years newest ipods. if i had known that i would not have purchased this particular product."
5,Great FM Transmitter b/c of INTERNATIONAL Mode,"i live in NJ, and this product is pretty good due to the fact you can change to INTERNATIONAL MODE. w/out this, i would not be able to transmit anything clear. every channel is broadcasted on. even sometimes under 88.1 i hear something being broadcasted. Overall this product is good. I cannot adjust the volume through my IPOD, but thats ok. Not as good as CD quality, but worth the money. I highly recommend this product. Like the other post says, make sure ur receiver unit can receive under 88.1"
2,wish it charged my ipod,bought with the sole intention that it would charge my ipod while i listened to it in my car. low and behold that is the one thing it does not do. Only buy if you will not feel inconvenienced by having to take your ipod out of your car on a regular basis to charge it.
3,Not quite what its supposed to do,"The product is great in regards to transmitting to my car radio. I have no complaint there. However, it will not charge my Ipod as advertised."
3,watch out if you want to use it with iPhone!,"I found this easy to program and to use after reading some of the previous reviews(the product info that came with it wasn't as good) - on channel 87.9 the sound is clear and the quality is great. BUT it DOES NOT charge the iPhone, which I only discovered after a long road trip and a dead phone...so Im back to using my old Belkin via the headphone jack and my approved iPhone car charger! Not so good!"
3,Not bad,This really deserves more of a 3.5 star rating. It definitely gets the job done but it's not really all that impressive and sometimes there is static with some poorer sound quality but it still gets the job done in the end. Nothing beats a cassette converter though.
3,Battery gets unusually warm,"Read the reviews and made this adapter my first choice. Sound is average to good; not too much difficulty finding a blank station to tune to (I live in Dallas). All in all, pretty happy with the selection; however I'm a bit concerned at how warm the IPod battery pack gets. I charge with USB and wall chargers, but have never had my IPod Touch battery get as warm as it does when connected to the Griffin. It's not too hot to touch, but I can feel the heat through the Incase silicon shell.Curious if anyone else has had this same problem."
5,Works great and perfect price!,"Needed something simple and affordable and this was it! Followed instructions to turn it into INTL mode and never had any problems finding a free FM slot to listen to my ipod. Output sound was fine, especially since don't have a fancy car with a top notch sound system... any special gadgetry to create awesome sound would be a waste in my car. Works great!"
2,misleading-ipod touch,This would have worked great if it had worked with my ipod touch-2nd generation. It doesn't charge (it does play though!) as was stated in the description. Hopefully they will change the description so that customers don't have to go through the hassle of returning items.
3,An OK solution,The Griffin 9501 Tripcbl iTripAuto FM transmitter is OK for charging and playing tunes on an iPod through the car radio. We bought 2 - one for our son-in-law who has an hour commute in rural NY and one for us. It works fine in a rural area. However we live near Washington DC and found that there is too much interference in a metropolitan area with lots of stations and traffic. The racket it makes when another car's system interferes is quite disconcerting.
2,Does not charge my IPod Nano,"The unit plays ok, but it does NOT charge my IPod Nano. I have to keep taking it in to the house or unplugging the transmitter so I can plug in the car charger. My IPod displays the following message: ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"""
5,great deal; works really well,"After seeing that some folks had a problem with the itrip, I was a little hesitant. Also, I had one in the past that did not work well--lots of static (it was one of the ones that plugged directly into the bottom of your ipod, no cord). However, this one works well. I have used it in the urban area where I live for weeks with no problem and have also used it in more rural areas with good results. It's easy to use--the digital display is great. I got it on Amazon for about 1/3 of the price it was selling for at Target, so that was a great deal too."
1,Not for Touch,I received this today.This unit does not charge ipod touch second generation as claimed. I will be returning it shortly.
4,"For $25, it meets expectations","I've been looking for a transmitter ever since I bought a new vehicle without a tape deck. Not wanting to pay $75, I came across this product. For the $25 it cost me, I have no complaints at all. I listen in mono mode becuase stereo had a lot of static, but in the car, you really can't tell the difference. Unless you are some kind of audio junkie, I find it hard to believe you won't like what this iTrip does for you. It is a transmitter, so you know you are going to get some static, but that fact is independent of this product. For somebody who wants to cheaply use their iPod in the car, go for it."
4,Pretty good!,"This is product is probably the most convenient transmitters of all the ones they have made! It is really easy to use but like all other products, its not perfect. But, it still is very nice and is a worthy buy!---P"
4,Good Considering The Price,"This transmitter is very cheap compared to the competitive market. But being cheap has its fall backs. There is always a degree of static in the background. I am not sure if all transmitters are like this, but you are better off with a direct connection. Setting the station you want to broadcast on is a breeze. Good product for the price.But if can have a direct connection I would suggest it."
1,Very Disappointed !!!,The transmitter must be too weak for a Nissan Altima. It was like listening to a radio station that your having problems getting a signal from. Very rarely did I get clear sound. Always a hiss. AND everytime somebody touched the wire I got a loud crackling sound. I have a XM set-up that uses a FM transmitter and I was expecting similar quality. Nope.... It is now in it's box on it's way back to Amazon.
4,"Easy to use, sound quality not the best","I've used FM transmitters with ipod's in the past, and I have to admit this is pretty nice. The ability to charge the ipod while transmitting is very helpful on my girlfriends nano. However, sound quality on every FM transmitter I have ever used has been pretty poor. If you are an audio buff, this is not the product for you!"
2,Weak transmitter,I bought this because I had a good experience with the Griffin Roadtrip. The Roadtrip is out in the open and I wanted something a little less obvious to the iPod thieves so I bought this iTrip Auto. It is pretty much worthless because of all the static. The transmitter is not nearly as strong as the Roadtrip.
1,doesn't charge ipod touch!!!!WTF!!!,"I read some other review on here that must've been written by someone who works for ""Griffin""cause they say they got it for their ipod touch and love it??!!.....This is BS it will transmit from the ipod touch to your radio but, a warning message pops up saying it won't charge it. be forewarned!!!"
2,Manage Your Expecations!,"I spent alot of time checking out the reviews of competitive products. Many reviews warned of the static-y connections inherent in these products (...likely due to the power output limits placed on the devices by the FCC). I was hoping this would be different but bottom line - - it delivers pretty disappointing sound. Lots of occasional static, hissing, and the dynamic range always sounds noticeably compressed/muffled. Since this is my second FM transmitter with the same limitation, I now believe it's a problem inherent with the technology. It's particularly noticeable since for the past 10-20 years, I think we've grown accustomed to the crystal-clear sound of CDs.My advice: Get a ""hard wire"" direct factory connection kit (expensive) or bring your car to some independent car stereo shop and have them run a direct connection cable out from the back of your radio in through the dashboard ($100-$150), and then connect your ipod through that."
5,Great quality,"Very easy to use, just find the proper frequency out of nearly endless options and the speakers in the car produce the sounds of the iPod in nearly perfect quality. Sometimes there is a little more static in some areas when driving than others, but then all one has to do is change the station on the device and in the car and then the sound is back to being clear. Worth the price."
3,"It's Alright, does what it soppost to.","I bought this as an alternative to buying a new Receiver with a an aux jack for my car. When plugged in it does what it is meant to do, charge and play your iPod. I use it with my 80gb iPod Classic (the box does not say it is compatible but it is). When playing depending where you are and how much interferances you will get static, but how annoying/bad the static is up to how much you care. This is not recommended for people who want the best sound you will not get a clear sound but it doesnt sound horrible either. I dont have an fancy audio system in my car so i dont care for some static. its worth the buy if you dont care about sound quality (as long as you can hear music ) then this is good. not great but good enough"
4,good not great,Good product but you can hear some static while playing your music. Its probably not the best choice if you live in a big city because there are stations on almost every frequency.
3,a little cheap,"The signal is not quite powerful enough to overcome the static in Baltimore, so I end up pushing the select button a lot, and it got stuck. Fixing it was pretty easy, I just popped the top off and superglued one side of the button casing back on, but for the $70 I paid for it, I don't feel I should have to fix something like that."
1,Poor performer,"I owned a previous version of the iTrip that I really enjoyed. I expected higher quality, volume-adjustable sound. I expected to be able to tune it to any station that my car plays.Instead, I have to crank my car radio all the way up to 90%, and can only use it in rural areas where there's not a lot of radio traffic.For whatever reason, Griffin decided not to include 87.~ range on this device - that's the only spot in my area that doesn't have traffic.I basically bought a $40 car charger."
3,"Its good, could have had a better reception ...","This is a multi-function item : The charger works great, it charges the ipod while transmitting music. The only downside for me is that the reception through the FM band is not too great, in fact I think that the transmission is poor, compared to the sound of a radio station, it lacks of performance."
2,More bad points than good,"The good point that it is easy to install and easy to use.I did enjoy it for several months in a particular location. Changing geographic locations increased my problems.However,The signal is weak compared to other similar units.This becomes frustrating overtime. If you wish to buy a unitfor broadcasting from the IPOD or similar device be certain that theunit you are buying has enough broadcast power. Otherwise you may start the switch the radio station to find a quiet zone for this ITRIP to broadcast over. Driving down the road fiddling with radio sations is not a safe activity.I have just replaced my unit with another manufacturers unit. The new onecan overcome the static to the point that my radio will drop a distant station that it found and synch with new unit. I could have never have done this with my ITRIP."
4,Probably the best FM transmitter for the price...,"I purchased the Griffin 9501-TRIPCBL iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod (Black) because my car stereo doesn't have a tape deck or a output jack. It's an inferior alternative to those, but the cheapest way to get your iPod playing in such a vehicle.This FM transmitter is great. Not crystal clear, but about radio quality I would say. It definitely matters how clear the radio channel is (quieter the better).I get worried about whether it over charges the iPod because you can't make it play without charging it, and I'm not sure if there's a functionality that protect the iPod battery.But it's really easy to use once you read the directions, quite manageable and does its job pretty well."
3,Average FM Transmitter,"When I bought this product because the rating was quite good. It works properly, no problem at all. The sound quality is not good though. I highly recommend buying CD player or mp3 player instead of FM transmitter."
1,fm transmitter for Ipods,"Perhaps this category of transmitter works in a rural or suburban environment. In a city, NYC to be specific, it is unusable. There are no locations on the FM dial which do not have static."
1,"Sounds good, Looks great, Manufactured to be replaced as junk","This is the 5th version of the iTrip that I have purchased. The last two (includes the Griffin 4026-LCDT & Griffin 9501-TRIPCB) were not durable and fell apart with normal use. Both failures reveal poor manufacture. Though I found the sound satisfactory and the ease of use a plus, the durability of the item should be a total embarrassment for Griffin: the 4026 casing popped open and the SELECT button slipped inside the casing of the 9501 making station selection impossible after a brief use.Earlier versions for the 1st generation iPod, 3rd generation (4 button), and mini served well."
4,"Nice, but lacking...","Of all the FM/Charger Transmitters, I guess you could call this the best for the money. Reception is lacking at times but should be expected with this method of audio transfer. Direct connection should be the only way to get better sounds from your MP3 player so having said that, four stars it about the best any of these transmitters should be given."
1,Griffin 9501-TRIPCB iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod,I just got this for X-mass. Apprently they didn't have the one I want so my mom bought this one for me instead. As soon as I get the recite back its going back to Best Buy. I tried it out and it was hard enough to find a decent FM station and when I found one the sound quality was horrendous. The sound was too faded and I was hearing more static then the actually music. My patience with this transmitter was very thin because listening to static isn't the most appealing thing trying to get the thing to work.The one I would recommend is the Griffin Technology 9631-NANOTRIP iTrip Nano LCD/FM Transmitter for iPod Nano. Even though it doesn't come with the car adaptor the sounding of this thing is awesome. My mom has one and its my next purchase for an fm transmitter.
2,It's not all that I thought it would be...,First of all I research everything I buy...extensively! I bought this because it had some really good reviews. I received it and used it for about 5 days trying to find a way to like it. Every station I put it on had some degree of static...and it's not like I live in a big city or a rural community. I was very disappointed in this product. I see it being placed in my next garage sale. What a waste!
4,great gadget,"This is one of the few gizmos that allows you to listen to your IPOD in the car while charging it. Plus, this allows you the freedome of getting the IPOD closer to you to change songs versus the other versions that make you dock the IPOD near the car lighter. Only downside is that the frequency starts at 88.1. That happens to be a problem here in Phoenix. Would be better to go down to 87.5."
1,Can't get it to work with my car,"The transmitter is very easy to use.Unfortunately it doesn't work with my car. No matter what frequency I select, my 2006 Volvo XC90 radio cannot get a reliable signal from it. It's like listening to a very remote radio station - the transmission is getting broken all the time. Probably issue is with how antenna is located in this particular car as other people are saying it does work."
4,Works Well for the Price,"I live in a large metropolitan area and have had no trouble getting the iTrip to work in my car. There are usually at least a few stations I can use, and it works much better than the belkin transmittor I originally had (and returned). We've used it on the road, as well, and were also able to find stations in rural areas. Every once in a while I'll drive through an area with a lot of interference, which can be annoying, but it doesn't last for long."
3,FM Transmitter,Works only OK. Amount of static makes it not that pleasant to use in my Subaru Outback.
5,Wow! Now it works!,"Read the review below that gives instructions how to set this to international stations. I didn't change the DX/LX setting (stereo or mono), but I did set it to 87.7. Wow! Now there is no interference! I live in a city where there is only one ""clear"" station and even that doesn't work very well. I've spent lots of money on several of these devices and they always disappointed me. Not this time. Wonder why the company doesn't advertise this? I bet lots of cars made overseas can get the lower frequencies."
4,Works great on International mode,"Everyone should read the review by Eric William, it should be added to the description of the product, it is THE reason I order it. I have used only one FM transmitter before and it was garbage, it worked once for about 15 minutes and then I could not find a station. Using this on the International setting I have not had to change stations and have only had minor static once or twice, a second or two each time. I am not an audiophile and my car radio is the typical stock radio/CD player. The iPod sounds no different than when I listen to a CD in the car. So for those of you just looking for something to use to listen to your iPod in the car I highly recommend this product, especially at such a low price.Car/Location data;I drive a '98 Nissan Altima and live in the Tampa Bay area (Pinellas/Pasco counties) and it was works great."
2,Weak signal downgrades product,This looked like it would be a good product since it had all the features I wanted and got pretty good reviews. My experience has been that it's signal is weak and results in distorted sound. I tried different frequencies on the radio and positioned it in different places in the car but always close to my antenna. Nothing I did improved the sound and I would say it is not usable if you want to listen to music.
5,Griffin iTrip,"This is a great transmitter! It has a strong output signal so you don't need to worry about static. And it's also a bonus that it charges your iPod while in use. One thing that I don't particularly like about it though is that it only has an input end for iPods and not just a generic audio jack, so it won't work with any other audio device."
2,Don't Do it.,"I got this. It worked fine just twice and thats it. Would not charge iPod Touch i repeat, DOES NOT CHARGE IPOD TOUCH."
3,"Works fine, but doesn't charge the iPod Touch","This transmitter works great, but the placement leads you to believe that this will also charge your iPod. It doesn't charge the iPod Touch, rather disappointing."
2,directions?,"it came very fast through the mail, but didn't come with directions on how to use it. i still don't know..."
1,horrible,"i've never bought a worse piece of hardware. tons of static, hum and low volume. i've tried many, many stations and settings, it's just not very good. i'm so bummed because i really had high hopes for this and i think my expectations weren't set too high. i expected it to at least sound as good as FM radio not worse that AM. i wonder if i can return it, probably not."
1,Does not charge IPOD touch,"I bought this unit for my IPOD touch, but this device does not charge the unit as advertised.I did not notice this until it had passed 30 days return period. Amazon and the seller refused to take this back.I will not buy any thing from either one of these stores.I even will cut my Amazon credit card."
1,Warning! Will Not Charge 4G iPod!,"This device WON'T charge a 4th generation iPod Nano despite what the specifications tell you. When I plug it in, the iPod says that it won't charge."
3,Works Ok - Reception is Poor,"The desing is nice, and the product works fine.But the quality of the recepction is really poor, even when using it in Chile, where there are no so many stations."
4,"if your city is small enough, this works well","I did some research on which was the best ipod-to-car option for me, and it came down to this one or the Kensington Digital FM Transmitter/Car Charger. I'm sure the Kensington model would have been great as well, but local availability led me to Griffin's model.As for reviews, it seems the transmitter works for you or it doesn't. Based on the people who wrote negative comments, it seems like city size might have ruined the signal for them. Because I live in a smaller city (40-50 thousand), my signal is usually crisp. Occasionally I'll run into some static, but it goes away once I drive past whatever was temporarily interfering with the signal. Perhaps car make/model plays a role (I drive an '03 Mazda Protege), but I don't see how that would matter.Bottom line- when searching for transmitters, consider city size and traffic conditions. If it's not too crowded, then this model will be just fine."
4,Good value for money,"This little FM transmitter does just what is says it does, not more not less. For the price is a good purchase. If the FM band is too busy in your zone it might sound with a bit of interference. Otherwise is OK."
2,Poor sound,this particular itrip produces poor sound. the high frequency parts are nearly non-existant. It sounds like an old transistor radio. I do not recommend.
2,Easy but broke after 2 months,I liked this devise. Worked with my Ipod Nano and with my iphone. It broke after 2 months of having it. I bought it at Target for [...] bucks much better steal here on Amazon.
3,"Does the job, but you still get interference","As you would expect it works ok, nothing amazing, and it could be the area i live in which doesnt have many open stations. Either way, for the money it beats buying a whole new headunit"
2,Fried in first week,This product was used only once. It fried after use on a trip. The total time it worked was for 4 hours and then it blew. I was very disapoited. One sales man at a local store said this one wouldn't blow. It DID!
1,don't waste your money,"Bought this awhile back and was hoping it would be an inexpensive alternative to allow me to listen to my ipod in my car. There is not a signal radio station that is static free. Sound quality from this unit is crap, lots and lots of static. Spend the extra money to get a better unit."
4,good so far,"So far I like it. I was disappointed that it does not charge the newest generation iPod touch though. Had I known that I don't think I would have bought it. It works well though, very little static."
3,Decent value,"The good news for the Griffin iTrip Auto is it works. I was able to listen to my iPod nano when NPR did its money raising campaign. The bad news about this and other speakers that I've used for my iPod is that it doesn't reproduce the music nearly as well as my ear buds do. Neither the bass nor the treble have good definition. So I'll use it only when I can't find anything I like on the radio, but won't make it a major part of my daily commute."
5,Works great wiith iPhone Original Model(Generation 1),Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter and Auto Charger for iPod works great with iPhone. This product plays my iPhone on my car stereo and charges on the go. Transmission is great and I don't see any problem with the sound quality.
4,Excellent quality for a great price!,"We really love this adapter. Not only does it charge our iPods but it also tunes them to play on the radio. In the past we've had other cheaper versions of and FM adapter that allows you not only to hear your music, but also a resonating feedback. This one does NOT do those things, it's great!"
3,Not for iPhone! Transmission is borderline.,"Doesn't charge my iPhone 3G... but it will broadcast it to my radio. It really doesn't broadcast very well, however. The volume is really soft, so I turn the volume up and then almost blow my speakers when I go back to the radio. Sound quality is borderline at best.I switched to one of those audiotapes with a wire - looks dorky, and doesn't charge the iPhone, but it sounds quite good. Next week I'm going to try hooking up an Exonic FM transmitter in the back of my car - it supposedly has more power, and I think if you get the transmitter (or it's antennae) back near the car's antennae it should work better. Up in the front, the car radio and antennae cable are heavily shielded to prevent interference from the car engine, so I guess I can't hold it against the little iTrip.My wife has a Sirius FM transmitter which works much better, but it has an antennae cable winding all the way back to the rear window..."
2,Don't Buy In Atlanta,"The Atlanta airwaves are so full of crappy radio stations it's hard to find one this device will work with.I can be driving down Piedmont and the damn thing will distort on me. Goes fuzzy, then totally distorted, then back to normal. Who wants to listen to their music like this?Same thing if I'm driving on I85. The sound fades in and out with a lot of heavy static. And we're not talking about quiet static, it's nearly twice as loud as the music you were listening to.And the sound quality when the signal is clear is extremely quiet. I have to turn my stereo up nearly all the way to enjoy music with the windows rolled up.I sold it for half price to a friend who lives south enough of Atlanta to put it to use. I went out and bought a new JVC stereo with built in iPod connections. I am VERY happy about that purchase."
2,WON'T CHARGE NEW IPODS!,"While the sound quality was great and it was easy to use, it will not charge my 5th generation ipod nano. I will be returning it. Any suggestions for an adapter/charger for 5th generation?"
3,Nice But Sound Quality Bad.,This product is very convenient for any vehicle but to me there is a different sound quality from the head phone jack to the mp3 output vs. the fm transmitter. All the sound is controlled by the radio with the transmitter vs controlling the sound and ipod options from the ipod. My vehicle is equipped with a sound system where you can hear the difference in both where as to my wifes vehicle it wouldnt matter. But all in all it'll do for vehicle hopping.
3,It's fine,"As long as one follows the instructions given in these reviews re:using intl setting, one can get decent but not faultless performance. Still some issues with signal interference even at 87.9/7 but reasonable for the price. Without these instructions though - a complete waste."
2,Might throw it out of window,"Hi,I used this to connect to my BMW 3 series,No engine noise as other customers wrote, But Pathetic reception, I would rather buy Cds,"
4,Transmitter works great!,Upon receiving the Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter I immediately went out and connected it to my car and began searching for the FM stations to listen to my IPOD. The transmitter already has pre-set stations that worked perfectly while traveling through the states of Tennessee and Georgia.
1,griffin isucks,This fm transmitter worked well. Until the 31st day I had it when it completely stopped working. The screen wouldn't even turn on. Of course it happened the day after all warranties are valid. This is my second Griffin fm transmitter and the first one would keep cutting off about halfway through every song and I would have to press either the plus or minus button to turn it back on. I contributed it to being left in my car in Georgia heat so when I received my second Griffin iTrip Auto I took it out of the car every time I was done with it. I will never buy another Griffin transmitter. I bought a Monster transmitter and we'll see how good it is when that 31st day comes around. Kensington transmitters are also a good choice but they are pretty pricey.
3,Cheap,"This thing is adequate, but could really be designed a lot better. I think it was cheap, though. It shuts off fairly quickly if it is left idle - like less than a minute. To turn it back on you have to unplug it from the power source and then plug it back in. Signal is weak, but I guess that's due to the FCC, not Griffin. Annoying having the controller bit in the middle of the cord. Seems like it would be logical to place that near the iPod end of the cord. Oh, and it doesn't return to the last setting when it's unplugged, so you have to push buttons every time you turn it on or else get a lot of noise from your speakers. Quite irritating, that bit."
5,Works great and is very portable,"iPod can be used with ease while driving, charges iPod very quickly. Like that the system scans for the best station as you will beed to change the station when driving into new areas, but the scan makes this very easy. This is the best fm transmitter I have ever used and would defintely recommend this particular transmitter!"
2,Just average,"This product works alright with my 3rd Generation nano, but I feel like I paid too much for what I got. The connection with my iPod is not secure and often wiggles out. The ""Smart Scan"" button is not very acurate. The signal is not particularly strong or clear. It allows me to listen to my iPod in my car, but it's not great."
3,Works well but weak on volume,"I have a Delco Bose system in my 2004 Suburban and this thing worked well out of the box. It's really simple. Looking at the instructions really is not necessary. If I have any complaints using it with my Gen5 Vid iPod, output volume is weak and non-adjustable. A lot like a weak station on the dial. I have to really crank the radio volume in order to hear the iPod properly and if I switch to CD or another radio station while forgetting to turn down volume......BOOM! Blasting volume shatters my audio harmony. The instructions don't really cover trobleshooting or anything like that. Just how to set freq, stereo or mono and thats about it."
2,Griffin transmitter,"I found the same trouble as the other reviewer. When it did work, it worked great but it is not well assembled. The reset button came out of alignment after a very brief period of time leaving it useless."
2,poor sound quality,"i'm very dissapointed in this fm transmitter. The sound is very poor, i can't even enjoy my music. And static is annoying, appears too often. Unfortunately, i'm not happy with my purchase."
1,This FM transmitter is no good for the city - Don't buy it,"This trasnmitter suck! It does not remember the last FM dialIt's signal is pretty week, so even the smallest signal for any radio will interfere with your ipod music! Other products have stronger signals so that will jam any other radio station on the same frequency and you'll here only your music.The screen is very bad. You can't see much with it, plus the fact that doesn't have a holder is really unconfortable.I returned this product to the store."
4,Works good but....,"This product works good, for about 30 seconds. I am able to hook it up and get it to play and 30 seconds into any song the Griffin iTrip shuts off. The sound coming out for those 30 seconds is crystal clear. I am in the middle of trying to get a hold of Griffin Techonologies so hopefully they will be able to help. I did everything people have said and how to set it up but maybe I am missing something. I know it can go into low power mode but it just completely shuts off and they I have to unplug and plug everything back in to get it to connect to the station I want (87.9 I believe). If anyone has any ideas as to how to fix this problem please post!! Thanks!! Received item quickly and in a unopen new package!"
2,"Poor transmission, lots of static","I purchased this product, because I wanted to stay on the cheap side. Unfortunately, that's exactly what is being delivered and I should have known better. I use this gadget almost daily and it is only inches away from my radio. Still, the sound comes with a lot of static in the background. I tried all kinds of different frequencies and always made sure that the adjacent frequencies are empty. I do not recommend this product to anyone and suggest you rather wait until you're able to spend a few additional Dollars to get a decent quality sound out of your radio/ipod."
3,Decent performance for Price,"Good product. Follow the helpful link about the 'international channel' on an earlier review, it'l help minimize static so you can maximize performance.Overall, a decent product for the price. Grab yours."
2,iTrip,"Charger on this iTrip doesn't work. I called the company i bough it from an they said that ipod is changing some of the software. So this iTrip would charge with an older version of the iPod Nano, but not mine. I bought mine March 09. The FM transmitter works good."
3,its okay..would be better if it charged the ipod,it is great except for the fact that it does not charge the ipod. I used to have an fm transmitter just like this but it charged.
1,Don't Buy This!!!,"The Griffin iTrip is terrible! At first I bought it thinking it would probably work better, because it was more expensive than a cassette adapter...I was wrong. I live in Los Angeles which has a radio station on every other channel. I couldn't go any two blocks without picking up static or a radio station. The sound quality was also horrible when I could get it to work. I turned the volume as high as it would go and I could still barely hear it. Then you forget how high you turned the volume and blow your speakers when you put it back to radio. A better recommendation is the AVB Cassette Adapter; it's three times less expensive, so simple, and works great; the sound quality is just as good as the built in CD player. It's definitely a NO for the Griffin iTrip!"
3,Easy to use,Got it today and I'm already enjoing it. Very easy to set up and ready to use. All you need to do is find the right fm tune.
2,"works--but very, very quiet","Works as promised, but on my system (factory stereo in a Nissan) the volume was so low that it was barely audible. I wound up finding it too much hassle for too little enjoyment."
3,"Works as advertised, but...","This product works as advertised, but not very well. First thing you will notice is that the volume will have to be increased considerably in order to hear the music. Not really a problem (unless you switch to a regular station without first lowering it) but depending on the quality of you radio, you will start to hear hiss from the extreme volume level. Also, the music will be very flat sounding - no bass or treble response - almost as if it were FM mono.If you aren't worried much about the sound quality, you can't beat the price. I found it unacceptable. My nephew has a transmitter produced by Monster, which I tried, and it was far superior to the Griffin, and twice the price. I ordered the Monster unit and am very happy with it. Spend the extra bucks."
1,iTrip charger????,"I am sorry I spent my money on this product. It does work as an auto transmitter and works OK as that. What I really wanted was something that charged my iPod as well but this item doesn't do it, even though it is advertised as such. When it is plugged in to my car and iPod it gives a message on the iPod screen that it doesn't function as a charger. Could have spent a little more somewhere else and gotten what I wanted."
5,Worth the money- but buy it from Amazon!,"For me, the iTrip works well, not as well as the original head-phone jack iTrips, but well for what you can get nowadays. The only problem I had with it is a slightly bothersome feedback I get from the engine on occasion, but I hang it over my leg while I'm driving and it goes away. But that's not why I'm writing this review... I'm writing to tell you if you want to buy this, BUY IT FROM AMAZON. I am not here to endorse Amazon, I am just telling you it will cost you AT LEAST twice as much any where else, I can't believe it is so cheap on here. Don't believe me? Check the Best Buy website right now, as it is currently listed for $69.99. I am also not here to take business from Best Buy, I would just feel really cheated if I had bought one from Best Buy and then went to review it on Amazon, only to discover it was 40 dollars cheaper."
2,Doesn't charge mi ipod touch,"When I plug it in my iPod touch (2nd generation, OS 3.1) appears a message like this: The iPod can't be charged with this device."
3,Works well with Nano 4G,"No problem synching FM station to device, but quality is a bit weak at times probably related to FM interference. I would recommend this to anyone with a car without the MP3 option."
3,Review of iTrip for iPod,iTrip is easy to use in the car for iPod that charges iPod and also broadcast sound through FM radio. Sound quality is sometimes affected by static noise but otherwise it is OK.
4,great for the price,"i think over all this is a great product. minimal static. My only complaint would be that if it bangs against something, it is pretty loud through the speakers. but really, thats a minor issue. all in all i've been very happy with this product. easy to learn controls, decent sound, and a good price point."
2,not as good as the old version,"I previously had the original version of the Griffin iTrip that I bought about 3 years ago, and I loved the way it sounded.. so, when I lost it, I figured I'd just buy the exact same one. I saw that they had updated it a bit, and I thought that meant that it would only be better than the original version that I had. Wrong. This one sounds terrible! I get so much static noise. Also, please don't recommend that I do the whole International version trick because my car doesn't tune to stations that low. I'm very surprised that the original version of this device worked better than the supposedly new and improved version does."
2,Does not charge...,Currently working with vendor to receive a new one or exchange for a different product. Product does not charge as specified. Vendor has been fabulous to work with though!
5,Great product for the price!,"Using Eric William's tips on changing to international mode and using 87.9 as my frequency, I had great reception everywhere on my daily commute (I kept it on stereo mode). I live in an area with overlapping radio stations from two major cities, and have no problems with interference. Bass is a bit low, but as expected. This does not charge an ipod nano 4G (the product does not say it can anyway)."
4,Good product,This product works pretty well. The cords in the car are a bit challenging at times but all in all the product works great. I would recommend this product if you need a break from the 10 CDs in your car and the same old radio songs.
2,What if you want to use it outside of your car?,"I love bringing my ipod to parties and broadcasting it through the stereo, what use is this thing then, NONE! Thanks for making us spend so much money Apple. This type of stuff should be built into the iPod for $400!!!"
2,Does not charge Nano 5th Gen or IPhone 4S,"I had an iTrip that I used for my original Nano, which worked just fine (besides the usual difficulties of finding an FM channel when you live near a big city). However, it did not charge my 5th gen Nano or iPhone 4S. So when I saw this advertised saying that it would charge these items (at least the Nano, can't recall if it said the 4S), I thought this might be the solution. Alas, it was not. So I'm returning it."
3,Does not charge my iPhone 4S,"I originally bought this product a few years ago for my iPod. I had virtually no problems with it. Since I was able to use the European frequencies of 87.7-87.9 MHz, I was able to find relatively-noise free channels with little distortion or interference. Thus, my audio quality was very good for this type of product. The transmitter has significantly more strength than another product I've used (the GoGroove FlexSmart SP, for which I also have a review).I've also used it more recently with my iPhone 4S, and the audio quality is just as good with that. After two plus years, it is still working fine. However, the big drawback is that for some reason, it will not charge my iPhone, contrary to Griffin's claims that it will. It charges my iPod Nano just fine, but no luck with the iPhone. For that reason, my review drops to three stars - it would be four or five if it did charge the iPhone."
1,Not great if you live in a Big City,I live in Los Angeles and almost all of the radio frequencies is taken up by some radio station. The auto FM transmitter is virtually useless if you live in a large city. It only works when you are out in the country side or in the middle of now where. Also this product is not compatible with all iphones. It works with my old iphone first generation but is incompatible with my iphone 4... I dont know why...
1,Stopped working in 2 months,"Bad unit. Very weak signal, weaker than the iRiver product. Seller won't support the product after 15 days. Mine stopped working after 2 months. Don't flush your money down the toilet. Go to your car stereo installer and get a low-end stereo that supports MP3 players for less than $100, usually installed. I've already lost that much on FM modulators that stop working"
2,Very cheaply made!,I bought one of these in 2008 and another in 2010 and both of them after about a year and a half started literally falling apart. The plastic around the plug that goes into your ipod just started falling off starting with the buttons on the sides. Also- when you touch the cord right below where it plugs into the device and move it around a little you get a ton of static coming through your speakers. The one I bought in 2010 is falling apart already and I don't think that I'm going to buy one of these again. I guess if you want a cheap itrip that you'll have to replace every 2 years (if that) go right ahead and buy this!
2,Not so good,"This model cannot be set for frequencies below 88.1, meaning you have to reset as you travel. Also had a lot of static."
1,"well, it did not work","Well, this thing did not work with my iPhone 3G.Rather, the transmitter did work (the sound quality was not great, I should say), but I had a message on the phone every time I plugged it in: ""this thing is not designed to recharge the iPhone"".Customer service was very prompt with response. They recommended 'soft reset'...... which did not work, though."
4,Works Pretty Good,"When i bought this product, i was skeptical because of my previous iPod transmitter, but nevertheless i wanted to listen to my music someway. I go this and i am glad i did! There is minimal static and the sound is pretty good for an FM transmitter, i also like the dual modes so you can listen to it when in a city where there is a lot of FM signals. I would recommend this product to anybody looking for an inexpensive way to listen to their iPod."
2,Poor sound quality / Doesn't work with iPhone 3G,"I used this in my Jeep Wrangler and the sound quality is very poor.Additionally, the iPhone 3G doesn't charge with it!"
2,Disappointing,"This product made it seem that is was able to charge an iPhone. I was very disappointed when I tried to use it, and it didn't charge my phone. This product does NOT charge an iPhone!"
2,"IT DOESN'T CHARGE THE G3 IPOD TOUCH, it only plays the iPod.","Product would have been nice. Bought 2 for the 2 vehicles, went on a trip and the ipod went dead in a few hours. Turns out that when they tell you it works on the iPod Touch it only works on the previous models."
3,Don't believe the hype,"I purchased this after reading the positive reviews here, particularly the one with the instructions on how to set up international mode. Sadly, what sounds too good to be true usually is. While setting it to 87.9 (87.7 is used for broadcast in LA) is BETTER than using other channels, there is still a good amount of interference and static.I imagine that using international mode in less populated areas results in a crisper signal, but that is not the case in Los Angeles. It has about as much static as any other FM transmitter that I've used. I'll probably keep it though, since it was only $20. It works, it just doesn't work as well as I thought it might.Btw, while it works fine with my iPod 5G, it will not charge my iPhone 3G. (Music still works)"
2,Charger does not work.,"This item works well for playing, but the charger does not work. I get an error message on both Ipods."
2,"Poor sound quality, doesn't charge Touch 2G","Unfortunately, this old model doesn't charge the iPod Touch 2nd Gen. The sound quality on these FM transmitters is terrible. I'd say worse than 64k mp3 quality. It works though."
3,"well, it's ok","Like the title, it works ok... I have a 4th gen nano. Finding a station that worked was tricky, it took a lot of experimenting. The charger doesn't work with my ipod, a little screen pops up on my ipod and tells me so every time I plug it in. Now that I've got a station set up, it does play music, but there's still static. But, eh, what can you expect for 13$?"
2,Won't charge 2nd gen touch,"I may have missed it in the description, but this will not charge the 2nd generation iPod Touch, which is what I have. That was okay with me because the price was low and all I really wanted was to be able to play my touch through my car radio. Now just a month after beginning to use it, there is a lot of static and I have to hold it just right to prevent it.Overall I am not satisfied because I am now looking for a new tuner."
1,Don't bet on it.,Despite repeated attempts to troubleshoot the poor sound quality I was unsuccessful. Sound was intermittent and often accompanied by static. Overall a big disappointment.
2,Good while it lasted,I bought this product from Amazon 2 years ago. It is pretty good quality for an FM transmitter. I was very disappointed when it started falling apart though. I didn't abuse the product. The black casing around the wires started ripping so that the wires were exposed. One wire became severed. Tried to fix with electrical tape...didn't work. The product became useless. Griffin Technology wasn't able to replace because they only offer 1 year warranty. :-(
2,Stopped working.,"Using the international mode instructions previously provided this thing worked fantastic, that is until is totally stopped working for no reason. I scanned through other reviews and found that this seems to happen to some of these things, so buyer beware. I'm not sure what to do, I don't have the packaging anymore and it has been two months since I bought it so I think I'm screwed. I might buy another one and hope it doesn't die on me but we'll see."
2,Bad sound quality. Not compatible with Nano 5g,"I bought this in a gamble to see if it would be compatible with my new nano 5g. It's not. I do still have a nano 3g, so I thought I'd use it with the old one. No big deal, right? But no, the sound quality is so bad, that I just had to return it. I know that FM transmitters will never have good quality sound, but compared to my old DLO FM transmitter, iTrip is garbage. DLO has a big cradle that's attached to the cigarette lighter, which is why I wanted an iTrip. But I think I'll stick with the DLO."
5,Excellent product,"Arrived promptly as ordered. Read previous reviewed which suggested reducing treble on iPod. Product worked very well in two different cars including a trip from upstate NY to Ky with only a couple of station changes.Recommend this product as well worth the money, worked as advertised."
4,Griffin Itrip,At first I was having problems finding a station but once I did it has been great. My only issue now when I'm driving downtown it's difficult to get a signal because of all the buildings interrupting the frequencies.
4,sound is never great on FM transmitters,Same old thing...all FM transmitters sound the same. But I do like that with this you can pick up your IPod to look at it vs the ones where it is stuck at the power source in the lighter.
2,Static constantly present,"In short, I'm disappointed with the quality of sound. Maybe Texas has too many stations, so it's hard for me to find a decent transmission of sound. Even 88.1 is an actual station in my part of TX. I tried several other stations; none where void of static, even though some had a lesser undertone than others. The hint of static was consistently present.It's kind of frustrating because I have a sports car and I don't want a bulky transmitter, so stylish wise this was the most suitable. I even read several of the reviews that were favorable, but it did not work for me. I guess its back to the drawing board."
4,great product,"It is wonderful to listen to all of my music on my ipod with the itrip. There are many different stations to choose from even in the city and the music comes through very clear. I also love that I can charge my ipod while listening to it in the car. The purchase was easy, shipping fast and I was very satisfied."
5,Works Great!,"I live in a very congested area (outside NYC) and I couldn't be more pleased with this product. There is no static and no weakness in signal. You do have to turn the stereo up a little higher than you would with a cd, but it does not cause the stereo to ""hiss"" as some reviews have mentioned. If you normally get good sound quality with the radio, you should not have a problem. I have had a few Belkin FM transmitters and this one works 10 times better."
1,Excessive static,This product's performace left a lot to be desired. The signal from the unit was very very weak and there was lot of static irrespective of the location of the cables and the unit. I find it hard to understand that this product has so many good reviews and bad reviews at the same time.
4,Very helpful gadget,"I got this knowing full well that I may not have the answer to the problem of fumbling with earphones while driving. However, I'm pleasantly surprised by how well it works. It's not perfect and you will pick up some static from time to time but if you find an fm station without any traffic on it, it comes in clear enough to be very serviceable. I live in the Sacramento region of California where there are quite a few stations to contend with. It took me 20 minutes of driving to find a station that worked and I haven't changed it.This is a good product. Be patient, set your own appropriate expectation and you may be pleasantly surprised as well."
2,A fairly dissapointing product,"The transmitter is really weak - you have to keep it as close to the antenna as possible, otherwise you'll get a lot of static. The nice thing about it is that it charges your iPod."
2,Will wait to use it once I move to the suberbs,"It was has a very verly low volume and in big cities,you don't even want to try it.You have to change radio frequency almost every second,it's distracting and the radio noise is just unbearable.It gave me a headach every time a used it,so now I'll keep it if we ever decide on a road trip(if gas got cheaper) outside the big cities maybe it'll work.If you live in a big city,DON'T BUY IT!!!!"
3,Works well outside of the city,This works well when you get outside of the city. In California it's kind of a hit or miss. I live in Sacramento and so if I use it while driving from Sacramento to the Bay Area it really doesn't work too well. There are just to many interfering stations to get a really clear channel. However if I head east or use it in less populated areas it seems to work just fine. If you live in a metro area you would probably want to spend the extra money and get a monster transmitter or something a little more powerful than the itrip. If you live in a rural state or area then it itrip should work fine.
2,Griffin iTrip,"This is the 2nd iTrip I've owned. Neither were stellar in the car. They allow you to interface the ipod into your car stereo, but the quality isn't great. The 2nd one I bought was HORRIBLE. On every bump, there was a terrible bass noise - seemed like it may have been deffective, but I wouldn't buy again. Better off w/cd's or the radio in the car."
2,Works - with a some glitches,"Sound is fine, but you need to make sure you keep it away from other power cords and devices otherwise you get interference.Also, this was supposed to be 100% compatible with 4 gen IPOD. It works with with the 4 gen IPOD, but the 4 gen IPOD will not charge off of the Griffin as advertised. Must be some in compatibility. Anyways, it's a pain because I can't just leave the IPOD in my car and charge it there, I need to bring it into the house.It also would be nice if the device had a ""seek"" feature that could help me find open channels on the FM dial. As I'm driving, I have to change the channel that I'm on."
3,Transmitter,"The sound quality wasn't as good as I expected on this. But it's still better than some for the money. But living in the city, it's virtually impossible to get stellar sound from a FM transmitter. I have my ipod connected to the back of my sony cd player with one of those cables that have 2 (red/white) on one side and the headphone jack on the other. But I bought this to have when I was in my wife's car or someone else's who doesn't have the aux jack needed on the player to listen to my ipod. Keep in mind that you cannot do what I did with that cable if you have a factory stereo in your vehicle. You will need one of those adapters that cost about 100 bucks. But at least then you can charge your ipod as well as listen."
2,You get what you pay for,"The transmitter does send a somewhat weak signal which results is static that I haven't experience with my other transmitter. However, for the price, it's a respectable value. Controls are easy enough to use and the plug into the i-Pod is easier to use than docking station transmitters. I'll probably upgrade at some point, but this is fine for now."
4,great value,"Nice, little product. This thing works great in areas with no radio channels, but you need to work a little bit harder to find something to transmits cleanly when going through city areas with lots of frequencies. Luckily enough managed an empty station in the denver area, so I'm stoked. Great deal for under $20, definitely worth it. Won't work better than a direct line in, but with this thing you don't have to worry about your ipod's battery because it powers and charges it for you. Trade off for not having a specific ipod dock cable built into your car radio, or even a line in/aux input set up."
4,Good for an FM transmitter,"This product works pretty well once you find a clear radio station. This can take some doing, as you must manually search through the dial and test. If you aren't on a clear station, some static will interfere with your music. But even in that case, if you think of it as radio, it's a radio station that you control, and has better reception than normal radio.Of course the quality is nowhere near a direct line or even a cassette adapter."
5,Love it! Great choice...works well!,"I use this FM Transmitter with my 1st generation black iPod nano. It's not a very good ipod, old and bad battery, but it works great with this little toy!This charges my ipod, and plays the music smoothy. Sometimes the station isn't even all static and still the sound is perfect.I recommend this project, it's inexpensive, but not cheap! Try it out (:"
2,Hardly usable,"If you want to listen to your mp3 player music in your car, I'd suggest to go for direct cable connection because this product isn't gonna do it. Low quality signal with a lot of noise, especially if you're always on the run, like myself, is unavoidable obstacle. I've tried different car, different players, but the outcome was the same."
4,Very pleases,"Very easy to use, took it out of the package and started listening to my I-pod right away. Great product for cars without cassette tape players like mine. There is some static every once in a while when the transmitter isnt close to the radio but other then that its great."
2,Check frequency availability before you buy!!!,"I live in a city where radio frequencies are not widely available; I cannot find a frequency where I can ""only hear static"" or where ""Both neighbor frequencies are available"". I was very disappointed to find these requirements on the instructions inside and not on any review or product description. If I go on the country side it works depending on which cities I pass on by. The sound is not perfect as a direct input to your radio. My Only advice, check you radio frequencies before you buy, it might work well if you live in ALASKA!"
3,iTrip--I guess it's okay,"This is a simple, easy to use transmitter.The problem is finding a radio station to tune it to in order to play my I-Pod clearly. I live in a city, and maybe that's the problem, but it seems like there is always static. And when I finally find a clear station, if I drive to another part of town I need to change it again."
1,HATE IT ! HATE IT ! HATE IT !,"This piece of crap has aggrevated and frustrated me endlessly! It's signal strength is pathetically weak and the audio level is real low. I'd have to turn the FM radio up really loud to hear it very well. Then, when the interference comes in (which it always does), or if you switch to AM or CD, now the car stereo blasts you too loudly because you had to turn it up so high. In cities, outside FM stations make the thing useless almost ALL the time. I finally got so fed up one day I yanked the piece of garbage out of the cig lighter and smashed it to bits. (I was in a bad mood that day, with a serious family illness and all, so that crappy transmitter really was the last straw...)GARBAGE! Don't miss it one bit."
2,Not enough signal for the buck,"I used it for a few days before sending it back. Too much static. Once I found a good, clear station, I would drive and the station would get full of static. Definatly needs more signal strength. Worked crystal clear when i went through a tunnel. =)"
4,Read compatibility before buying!,"This thing was shipped amazingly fast! Works well with my iTouch 2nd generation, but it does not charge. I repeat, this device does NOT CHARGE IPOD TOUCH 2ND GENERATION. I didn't see the compatibility until after I purchased it. Ah oh well...still good. However, I get a few static sometimes when I play, but that just might be my setting. Overall, good."
1,Broken misteriously,"I owned this for only 3 months and it broke. I have no clue how it broke it just stopped working completly. I even tried to replace the fuse (no luck). This may turn out good for you if purchased, but I had a horable experince with it. I would not recaimend anyone to purchase this product."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!!!!,"Horrible purchase.... You are MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better off with a cassette player adapter. I returned my item to AMAZON (great return policy) and purchased the Sony adapter. Much, much better!P.S. - I only gave it a star b/c you are required to. If not, I would have given it zero stars"
1,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE! Awful seller!,"When I ordered this item from BLUEPROTON in Sept, 2006, I expected to receive it quickly... three weeks later, I contacted the seller to inquire about its status. The seller sent me a USPS tracking number that stated it had been delivered only a week after I ordered it, but the item never arrived at my house. I went to the Post Office where they told me the tracking number only confirmed it was delivered to a regional distribution center 60 miles from my house. After four full weeks, I asked the seller to help me in locating the item. They stopped returning my emails and would NOT help at all. All they had to do is file a claim with the USPS and they would get reimbursed for the item, but they REFUSED to do even that. If you want to gamble, you can order from this seller. I will NEVER order from them again!"
1,Broke on the First Use,"I had literally just plugged it in. I found the station I wanted to use on the radio, then I found it on the iTrip and pressed the ""set"" button. It broke. As soon as I pressed it, the button went below the body of the iTrip and was irretrievable. I discovered this when I decided the reception on the station I chose was not as good as I'd like. But the ""set"" button was stuck in the down position, and no amount of digging could bring it back up. I was stuck with the first station I selected.Since the receipt was long gone and I couldn't return it, I tossed it out of the window, ran over it in the parking lot, and bought the Monster iCarPlayer Wireless Plus. Works beautifully."
4,Good working,"I bought this item some weeks ago and so far no problem with it, amazon shipped it fast and with no delays."
4,Great ....Can't beat it for the price,I am using this on our boat. It works awesome right out of the box.We hook up several boats on the lake and each boat can tune in - makes for a great party!
5,Awesome product!,I recommend this product 100%.I lost my old iTrip and didn't hesitate for one second to buy the same kind again.Great product!
2,"Bad Quality, Low Sound Output","Bad sound quality transmitter not even giving worth a shot.If your player has 100% sound output, once the FM transmitter is connected ,it goes down to 50%."
3,..the Man with One Eye Is King.,"I've tried a couple of itrips and either I get bad quality or poor signal strenght.With this device I get ok quality and signal strenght good enough for out of city trips, and that's mainly for what I wanted this for. In the city (Santiago, Chile) is still not usable (too much interference)."
3,Not Charging,This product works fine except it does not charge the IPOD while operating. Not a very big deal for me since I do not spend hours at a time on my IPOD.
4,duplicate,"I was sent 2 of the one item I ordered. It was just a pain having to mail it back, but they worked with me and were prompt to respond. They paid me shipping to ship the extra back."
2,thought it would be better,"I read the reviews before buying any transmitter. The transmitter is a crappy option for listening to ipods. Sound is scratchy, distorted and not great --especially if you are going from using a tape adapter to an fm transmitter. I would recommend just getting a jack installed to hear your music it would be money well spent instead of thrown in the drain."
4,Its good,"The volume can only be controlled via the car stereo. So if you want to REALLY rock out, just forget it or keep your favorite cd's on hand.Maybe its my radio but I noticed that downloaded songs that are older, pre iPod, have lost a good bit of sound quality from constant play.Small and can be very inconspicuous. Easy to use."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"The signal is VERY weak, and it doesn't work consistently. Don't spend money on this thing, you will be disappointed."
3,Its good..its bad,"I don't have an aux-in in my car. So, I bought this accessory.Cons:1. doesn't charges my Ipod Nano 4th gen.2. has to be kept too near to audio system antenna inside the car.Pros:1. Very easy and simple to use.2. If you place it near your car's fm antenna, and if you find an un-used frequency, the audio quality is excellent.Altogether, its an ok thing to buy if you stay in a small town, or if you travel long distance frequently. Because in both the cases you can get an un-used FM band. These FM transmitters work good only if you get an un-used FM frequency. If you live in a big city or downtown, its difficult to get any un-used FM band, in that case any FM transmitter won't work. I stay in a small city and often travel long distance on highways, so its good for me. I would say, keep burning ur CDs plus buy this things. Even if you can use it 10-15 times a month, its worth the cost it is for."
4,Works well,"I've been using this transmitter for about two months now, and overall it works well. It's easy to use, and it's reliable, and the sound quality is acceptable (although I'm no audiophile). It's got a few odd quirks--for example, I would expect that the preset button would select preset 1 each time the unit is plugged in, but in fact it picks a different preset each time! (I solved that problem by setting all four presets to the one frequency I use.) Also, if the volume is low on the music I'm playing, the unit shuts off, which means I get a big blast of static through the car's radio. Other than that, I'm thrilled, especially for the price!"
1,sucks,TO PUT IT IN ONE WORD THIS ADAPTER SUCKS. EVERY CHANNEL SOUNDED TERRIBLE. DONT WASTE YOU MONEY
1,terrible transmitter,"the worst transmitter i've ever owned.. they fail to tell you that it onyl works with some ipods; my ipod touch, ipod 3rd gen, iphone, ipod nano 5g, and 2g nano ALL don't work with this unit.. AND it was sent in a baggie all scratched up; i'm not gonna mince words over $14, but what a hunk of crap."
5,great,Very impressed. Excellent service and price. Use it all the time and it has excellent signal strength and range of options.
5,Great Value,"This FM transmitter works great in my car. I took a suggestion from one of the other buyers and switched the transmitter to ""Intl"" mode and set my radio dial to 87.9 (which is completely free of other broadcasts).The sound is crystal clear every time and I could not be happier with my purchase."
5,Better than I expected,"Now that I've been using this transmitter for a few weeks, I've been surprised by how well it actually works. The area I live in has so many radio stations that you cannot find an empty station that has empty neighboring stations as well. When I first used the transmitter, I left it on 88.1, since I knew that was an empty station. The device worked just fine, but it had some static. Come to find out, the static was there because 88.1 wasn't empty in the first place, but the transmitter played right over it! The device does produce some noise that's a bit louder than average radio static; but like I said, that's probably because I'm not able to get a station with empty neighboring stations. It works extremely well for its price!(Note: it does not charge an iPod Nano 4G; but it doesn't claim to, so it's all good)"
4,iTrip works fine,So far I have been satisfied with the iTrip it works fine. It is nice that you can digitally tune this in to various stations to find one that is clear. Depending on the style of music you are listening to and how sensitive your hearing is you might notice that there is a some noise distortion and certainly there is a reduced range of frequency. I find this product works as well as you can expect from an FM Transmitter. There are better solutions but for the money this is a good product.
4,"Tested and so far, so good!","I tested this as soon as I got home since I received the package today. AWESOME turnaround time with shipping by Amazon by the way! I must say, by the comments left about the sound quality I thought I was in for your basic audio. I'm a huge home theater/car sound enthusiast so I am very picky about my sound. Once I dialed in to the station I had I wanted to use and pressed select, the radio fuzz when dead quiet and I pressed play on my iPod. Solid, SOLID sound. Maybe it's the nice system already in the car, but I didn't find myself having to turn up the volume to get great sound cause it already sounded very nice. Tested songs with heavy bass and songs with a lot of acoustics. Factory sound system too! My ears were pleased and it passed. Better than radio by far, but not quite CD...if that makes sense. I would recommend to anyone!!! Pleased customer!"
3,Works Somtimes,"If you live in a rural area, this item would probably work well for you. In an urben area with numerous radio stations, you're going to be out of luck. We haven't had it out on a trip yet...we'll try it out this summer...but in town, it sucks!"
2,Make sure you have a quet car.,"I had a long trip planned, and the ipod is a great for theser kind of trips - espcially as I was going to listen to the School of Podcasting's morning annoucements - my favorite podcast. However, I had to turn the volume up on the stereo ALL THE WAY, to ALMOST hear it. If it was a remotely quiet song, you had no chance. If you were driving next to a truck, forget it. I'm not sure if this is an FCC thing, but it sure was annoying. I ended up replacing my car stereo, and buying one with an 1/8"" auxilary input."
5,This unit is great,"I found this product yery use full It works great with my I pod classic in three of the cars I drive. Dodge van,ford taurus and ford ranger. All with factory radio's. I set the radio to an unused station. set the griffin transmiter to match. and press play on the pod.I found when traviling the cars radio might pick up a radio station signal when getting in range,it will just cut in. I just locate an another unused station and reset the griffin to match. The unit isnt perfect, but for the price and what it does I find it good enough. Also the sound and clarity is very good to."
2,THIS ITEM DOES NOT SUPPORT CHARGING,"As an FM transmitter, this item is sleek and works well. HOWEVER, although the packaging and description states that this thing charges your ipod -- it DOES NOT. When i plug it in to my ipod nano, the screen says ""This device does not support charging"" (or something along those lines). So make sure your ipod is charged, cause this pretty little device doesn't do it."
4,iPod nano 4th generation compatibility,"If you plan on using this with the newest nano, that is the 4th generation one be aware that it will transmit music but it will not charge it."
5,Works like a charm,"I've been using the Griffin iTrip for two months now and it works like a charm. I live in a moderately sized metro area and encounter some, but limited issues with finding an open frequency and the occasional bleed-over from neighboring stations, but have found the iTrip up to the task.The sound quality is definitely FM and not CD, however, if you had a high-end car audio system and required CD quality, then I suspect you wouldn't be considering this as an option for your iPod.I have not encountered any of the volume problems metioned by other posters. I have experienced good results using the ""stereo"" setting. Some of the older CDs have lower volume and I find that on those tracks I must crank the volume a bit, but in general volume has not been an issue."
1,THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!,"IF you live in BFE, with no one else around you, ever, then this might be a great product. But you decide that you want to drive to say, Los Angeles, or Salt Lake City or some place that might have other people around, forget about it. Go buy a new stereo with an auxillary input. I was so pissed that I spent $50 on this product that doesn't work. If I hadn't thrown away the box so quickly I would have returned it, post haste."
2,It would be great if it worked!,"This device seemed just right: small, inconspicuous with nicely lit remote -- perfect really. BUT, when I connected the iphone my attitude completely changed. Now, I've used a few other FM transmitters such as the iRock and iRiver and realize that the sound is compromised by occasional static. But this Griffen gadget is MUCH worse than the other ones. The static never goes away unless turned to mono and even then it reappears while driving. I tested it side by side with the iRiver and no contest -- the Griffen has a much weaker signal. I really wanted a cable to charge the phone while listening to music but this product falls far short. Hopefully there is something better out there."
2,Eh.,"I am not entirely pleased with this product. The iTrip I purchased a few years ago worked great, so when it broke I wanted to find the exact same product. When I found the picture of ths iTrip it looked exactly the same, but the one delivered to me looks totally different. It has a scan option which I really dislike. My first iTrip didn't have a scan and I could keep it on one station (87.9) and it was never fuzzy. The reception on this iTrip is constantly fuzzy and I always have to press scan to find a good channel. Very annoying."
3,Griffin is good,Just don't expect to get the best signal in a city because the radio towers will overhwelm your griffin fm transmitter
1,Don't waste your $$$,"Don't waste your time or money with Griffin or any of their products. I've given their products several chances and every time they've let me down. Constant static and eventually after only a few months, quit working altogether. Maybe I've just had bad luck but I'm done with their products."
1,Terrible,I've owned three FM transmitters and this one is by far the worst. Does not work on stations that worked with the other two. Will be transmitting fine then all of the sudden cut out. Do not buy.
1,"Tons of static, weak transmission",I found that the static was so strong with this product that I was constantly changing the channel settings to get a better signal (a totally clean signal was impossible). I wound up buying another transmitter which works great.
5,iTrip joy in UK,"after picking up similar products on travels abroad, none of which worked satisfactorily, i was pleasantly surprised with this.plugged it in, tuned the radio, it worked immediately, though a little quiet. a bit of experimentation with different frequencies eventually gave me a signal level similar to radio stations. this is with the unit at the front of the car (mini cooper), when the aerial is to the rear of the roof.recommended"
3,Good but not great,"I used this transmitter for about a week and I had constant problems with static and poor reception depending on where I was. I also could not blast it like I could radio stations. However, while it workd, it was pretty good. Needs much more signal strength. That would make it great!"
3,NOT GOOD FOR TRAVELING,"This item works fine and I really like the ""charge while in play"" feature. This item works great in one area where you wont have to search for a frequency often. However, should you hit the road for a road trip it is less than convenient to search for a decent frequency while driving, and then doing that constantly as you head through different areas. I feel like I need to devices - one for home, and one for roadtrips!I would not purchase this product again, but thats due to my roadtrip lifestyle, not necessarily a defect of the product."
5,Excellent,This is just what we were looking for. It's very practical and the quality of sound is excellent. Great price! Retail price is double as what they have it in Amazon for.
2,Griffin iTrip - weak signal,I was not happy with its weak signal and actually gave it away. I am now looking for a more powerful transmitter. I have to crank the radio all the way up and it still isn't loud enough!
2,Worked for Less than Year,"Although the iTrip worked really well for a few months (and I loved being able to use any radio station I wanted to play the iPod through, instead of being limited to just a few preprogrammed stations), it stopped charging my iPod while being plugged in after only a few months of use. Now, not only will it not charge my iPod, it won't play songs without horrible scratching and bumping noises. I simply cannot recommend this product."
1,Save your money,"Right out of the box it DOES NOT charge your 4th gen., 8G iPod as it says it will (the reason I had to upgrade). Do they still call this stuff rip-off? So now do you pay postage to mail it bac or not bother..........."
4,Good Product,"I love the plug and playability of this product. The only drawback is if you choose a station with a strong signal, it may bleed into your music. The volume doesn't seem to be as loud as the radio, or CD, but if you turn it up nearly all the way, it's plenty loud. Also, I just recently upgraded my iPod Nano to the new 16 GB Nano and found that the charge function is not compatable with the newer Nanos."
5,brings life to my old ipod,"I own a second generation iPod mini that's nearly four years old. After the original battery stopped working properly, I ordered a replacement battery which worked well for a while, but then would still have the same problems as the first; always starting up slow and dying when the indicator on the screen showed the battery still had half of its charge. In addition, my headphones have long been broken, so it's been a long time since I've used my iPod. I got this iTrip for Christmas, and it works great. Since it has a built-in charger, the battery problems on my iPod are actually no problem, and now I don't need to have all my CDs in my car to listen to my music, as it's all on the iPod. The only drawback is that in my area there are few FM stations that are open, but I have found a few that, when my iPod music is playing, produce no noticeable static. In addition, the presets feature is great and works excellently with setting presets on your car radio."
4,Griffin iTrip Auto FM Transmitter,"Decent quality. Purchased for myself, my cousin, and my mother for gifts. Makes long car rides much more enjoyable!"
3,Better in rural areas!,"Fairly easy to use except when in a downtown area where many radio channels exsist. You can spend much time trying to program (scan) for new uninturrupted frequencies. Does a great job charging the ipod, and is esthetically pleasing."
1,Do not buy this,"This product does not work. It is not the fault of the product, but rather the fault of some regulation that limits the radiofrequency power output of the device. It may work better in cars that have a very good radio receiver, but for me in my Toyota, it is all static and noise. I would not buy this or any related product again - go with a wired hookup for your iPod (i.e. cassette or auxiliary input)"
3,"Medium-Strength signal, will NOT charge the iPhone","This device does what is advertised. My frustration is with the omissions. I assumed since it would charge an iPod, it would charge an iPhone. It doesn't. Also, compared with other FM transmitters I've used, the broadcast strength seems to be less."
4,Pretty good but not the best thing in the world,"I'm going to keep this review short, this item is worth the buy if you have to constantly burn CDs as the only alternative like me. However, read Eric William's review for the best possible experience. If you follow his instructions, this product generally outperforms other similar products that I own. However, if you live in a urban area, this product seems prone to interference by other radio stations, but especially CB radio. Every time I drive next to a Semi I get weird static and sometimes even cross-over from the radio the driver is using, however that could be the channel I'm using... although it's the only one that works in my area so it's not like I can switch to another one.PS - To anyone saying otherwise, this product totally charges my 1st gen iPod Touch just fine."
2,Not durable,"I was very pleased with this product when i first got it, but it fell apart very quickly. the wires all all started showing, and eventually those wires then bent and distorted the sound quality until it ultimately broke. if you plan on using this frequently, and not leaving your iPod sitting in your car at all times, wear and tear will ruin this device quickly. i would not recommend it."
2,poor sound quality even without radio station,"I got this from walmart (with a much higher price). The sound quality is not clear even if there are no stations at the frequency you choose. I'm sure it's below radio quality. We had a long trip of 1000 miles to Florida and had to constantly change frequency in order not to be bothered by stations. The ""international mode"" trick doesn't really work. I can't get below 88.1 even after I changed it to ""INTL"" as another reviewer said. Neither do my car's radio go below that frequency. We used it only for the first day of our trip. We can't stand the noise from the stations. returned it just after the trip.Now I wonder why would somebody buy this when he/she can get a aux cable for $1 or a cassette adapter for <$10?"
4,A BIG Improvement,"This is the third FM transmitter I've bought, trying to use my iPod Nano with my new car which isn't MP3 ready. The first cheapie unit just didn't fit into any of my electrical ports (read: cigarette lighters), the second quit after two days. Both had such horrible sound quality, with static, hiss, etc., I figured I was doomed to either buy a whole new sound system or be forced back into CDs. I was skeptical but happy to be proven wrong with this Griffin product. No it's not as great as even the old cassette player adapter, but it's MUCH better than I expected.I'd recommend this without hesitation. The price is right and it works."
3,Doesn't charge my nano.,"This thing works fine as a transmitter. But, my iPod nano says ""Charging is not supported for this accessory"" so no charging is done. Otherwise it works fine."
3,WILL NOT CHARGE FIFTH GEN. NANO,"This is a great product and both charges and plays great with my old IPOD NANO, but I recently bought a new FIFTH GENERATION IPOD NANO (16 gig) and it plays great BUT THE CHARGING FUNCTION WON'T WORK."
5,Trasmitter works great!,"The audio is crisp and clear. The signal is way better than any of the other transmitters I bought that were more expensive. Be sure to follow the review by Eric William. He tells you how to get the best performance out of this thing, and it works!"
1,Does Not Work!,I had high hopes for this little device but no dice! I was even able to place it on International setting to use a lower bandwidth. The result was very low volume and constant static. Perhaps its better in rural areas without a million radio stations but not in LA!.
4,Good for the money,It was exactly what I expected. The transmitter works better than the one I've had from monster but it doesn't eliminate the radio distortion sound completely. It's a good product for the price.
3,Just OK,"This product is just OK. I had a difficult time finding 3 locations in a row on the dial to set a preset. This won't really be useful on long trips without a lot of fanagling to find new ""empty"" areas on the dial. When functioning, functions well."
3,"Good for around town, problems with longer travel","Bought this item because I was going on a road trip, and wanted to be able to play my iPod over the car stereo. It requires that you find an ""empty"" frequency on the fm dial, and then set the transmitter on this device to that frequency. This works ok if you're staying in a relatively small area with your vehicle. Once you start travelling further, though, you'll find that you'll need to change the frequency as you move into an area where the frequency you chose initially is now ""occupied"" by a radio station. In larger metropolitan areas, it can be difficult to find a frequency that's available for you to use, because frequencies close to where you are transmitting your iPod will ""bleed"" into your frequency and interfere. Bottom line, works ok, especially for the price, but may not work well for you if you are travelling or live in an area with a full dial of fm stations."
1,misleading,"it says on the package ""works with new ipod"" ""nano 3G"". well it works as far as the fm transmitter but it wont charge the ipod. waste of money"
3,Works in one car - not on the other,This product is not for hearing music. I listen to podcasts and its okay for listing talk shows.The funny thing is it works okay on one of my cars but adds a lot of noise in my second car. Both the cars have the same brand/model radio but for whatever reason there is more noise in the second car.
3,It works but how long will it last?,"I have only had this about a week. It tunes in and plays my ipod through my car stereo. it feels a little ""plasticky"", cheap and breakable. I will be surprised if it makes it through the humid summer... but for now, it works. and it was cheap!"
2,Not really the thing,"I had hoped I would be able to listen to my entire music library on my Nano in my car, but this device was disappointing for a couple reasons. First, despite doing all the recommended adjustments (using the international setting on a very low bandwidth, etc)the sound quality is poor. Also, I did not realize that the device, which advertises as a Nano charger, would not charge a 3rd Gen Nano (in fairness, it did say so in the advertising - I just did not read it in time). Overall, a real disappointment."
1,Beware,"Don't know others experience with this product, but my roommate and I both bought the same itrip from Griffin. He has a nano, I have 3rd Gen itouch, neither will charge through the itrip. Also I live in a fairly rural area and the sound from this product is quite scratchy. If you like the sound of old scratchy vinyl and don't want to charge your ipod buy this product."
3,So-So Product,"I purchased this product to replace an all in one setup where everything was attached at the lighter plug. I must say that I am disappointed in the operation of this product. I have no trouble getting a signal but its scratchy at best. I have tried multiple stations and get the same result. I haven't tried it in my other car yet, so it could be the location of the antenna on the car.Overall, I like the smaller size and ease of use.I am only giving it a three star rating because I haven't had any real luck getting a crisp signal"
5,Great for the Money,"It works well and there are only minor situations where any static can be heard. Considering the amount of FM radio broadcasts in the tri-state area, it's understandable. Excellent value."
4,DOES NOT charge 4G Nano,"I bought this for use with my 4th generation iPod Nano. It plays, but DOES NOT CHARGE. When you plug it in, the Nano says ""charging not supported with this accessory"".The sound quality is close to that of FM radio.For $25 this is a decent value. (especially considering Apple will charge you double this price or more for the item)"
3,Great price Fair product,"This works pretty well. The transmitter is a litlle weak and I get spots of static while driving. But for the price, I am pretty satisfied."
