1,Terrible,"Do not expect to see those three Extra 300 aircraft flying in formation in the movie! I bought the movie for that but it is for the cover only, 3D is good, actual flying and the landscape gorgeous, theme and acting terrible, I think they built the movie around those two flying scenes, a waste of money."
2,Bad career decisions,"This album was a huge disappointment, the proverbial square peg in the round hole. The band did not learn it's lesson on ""Love Beach"".Although there are a few positive notes, they are quickly overshadowed. This is mostly all painful, even after giving it a chance.Some tracks are particularly bad should be re-named by the Producer In The Long Black Coat:Chops On Ice; Thin Line Between Progressive and Pop; Give Me A Reason Not To Throw It Away; Change For the Worse; Gone (Not a Moment) Too Soon."
3,"Come on, it's not that bad!","An ELP-Album is always interesting, even after I-don't-know-how-many-years they sound fresh.... apart from In The Hot Seat which isn't interesting nor fresh. It's just soapy pop. Still, in a time where Techno decunstructs music, I was grateful for that kind of music.Still, just buy it if you're an ELP-collector. Otherwise, get all their early stuff, even Love Beach, which isn't that bad at all, is it?"
3,"Not ALL bad, just MOSTLY bad.","Although this isn't my favorite ELP album by any stretch of the word, there are some good things in it. I like the intro to the first track, but don't care much for it after the singing starts, and I like the 3rd track (but I like dark sounding songs like that anyway). The rest of the songs are not memorable, and the whole album reminds me of Love Beach in that it wasn't that memorable either.The one thing that this album lacks, that Love Beach didn't, is a really good instrumental like Canario. I have always been facinated by Keith Emerson's playing and am going to give the album 3 stars just for that. Even though the song aren't the best, I can't deny the talent."
1,Should have never been recorded/released,What were they thinking ? This cd should be free inside a box of cereal
1,It's pretty bad.,"I always defend ELP when people make fun of them and I thought Black Moon was good. But something went horribly wrong in the making of this album. It's just awful. Love Beach is far better, just to give you some perspective."
2,Disappointing.,"After I read an excellent review I ordered this 2 discs set. I was very disappointed but in any case it is not bad. As far as I understood this is the first recording of this piece, and I appreciate the work done. However, the soloists are too loud many times, the chorus is not impressive and the Orchestra often sounds too dull. I did not get the ""rich Italian Verdi style"" as I expected. Maybe it is after all a question of taste."
5,Great Book if you're pressed for time.,"I usually flip through the book as soon as I get home from work. This book is great because I can always find something to make for which I have all the ingredients; I just need a bit of inspiration. I've even given the book to gfs who are moving out on their own and need a ""no excuses"" yummy and quick cookbook."
2,Unimpressive,"I was a little let down with this book. Can't put my finger on it but usually I buy a new cookbook and mark about 30 different recipes I can't wait to try and there really wasn't anything here that moved me. Also, for the price and a large, color hardbound book you would expect pictures of everything and they are few and far between. I don't think its worth the money."
2,Skip this one,"I'm a big fan of Cooking Light magazine and their cookbooks. However, I was disappointed when I bought this one. There are some really good recipes in this book but there are more that i'll never make. When I think of superfast suppers I think of good food that my family will enjoy eating. Most of the recipes in this book just don't fit that description. I would recommend any of their annual recipe books and especially The Complete Cooking Light Cookbook, I've made many dishes from that one and my family has loved all of them!"
5,Great selection and time saved,"As with all Cooking Light publications, this one is chock full of tasty entrees with accompanying side dishes. All laid out in an easy to read and easy to prepare format. The meals in this book take very little time to create and they never disappoint! Highly recommended!"
4,"It's Good; Not Sure if ""Superfast"" is the Word, Though...","I just received this cookbook and was super excited to see some pretty awesome recipes in it. My only question is about the choice of the term ""Superfast."" To me, a wife that works full time, weekday dinners need to be fast. And, there is a plethora of information out there on fast meals, but most aren't too healthy. I need a combination of both. And, I thought this would be it.But, I think the term fast means something different to me. These are quick, easy recipes for 7PM on a Monday when I get home. These require a lot of additional prep that I wasn't looking for.It will be great for weekends when I have more time, but for weekdays, I continue my search. Looking for the holy grail that is the truly healthy, yet quick, weekday cookbook. The search continues! =)"
4,"Wonderful for nature lovers, but just too short...","Our one-and-a-half daughter loves it since the DVD arrived. We wanted her to watch something other than those addictive characters with commercial interests built in. This lovely gem delivers what we enjoy as well: sky, clouds, waterfalls, rivers, dragonflies, humming birds, bears, etc. The music selection is excellent. She particularly loves the moons at the end and giggles at those lovely babies.The only downside: the main content is less than 14 minutes long. No extras or anything. Considering the DVD entertainment business nowadays, this is probably the most expensive 14 minutes we've ever bought. In addition to the cost, no typical dvd players can be set to repeat a movie so we have to find the remote to play it again (this is the only program we are not worried about her watching it more)."
3,Better than the movie by far... but that isn't saying much...,"I am a classic SW lover... and have not been very happy with the new movies, games, or cartoon show... and I am especially irritated with the changes made to the original 3 movies. Not necessary.Anyhow, the novel of the Revenge of The Sith was pretty fun to read... and at least you don't have to witness Anakin crying through the whole thing... since he is actually cool in the book instead of a whiny little jerk."
5,even though i knew.,"i still didnt think it would happen. this book was great, it caught the darkness perfectly. you will probably get more out of this book than you will watching the movie. you will know what they were thinking at these moments when you read the book."
5,Well Done but it still needs to more extense,"This is an amazing book. I bought it 'cause I'm a huge star wars fan. I read it and it really explains the story like if you were in Coruscant, Mustafar and Utapau. It also has deleted scenes from the movie and all-new-scenes. There's only one flaw: there's missing some scenes from the battle of Coruscant and Kashyyk was kind of missing. But even though, it's really satisfactory and pretty complete."
5,Sith Happens,"My daughter and I are both great Star Wars Fans. This book, like the Lucasfilm-sanctioned novels before it, does a great job of bringing the movie's details to life.We love it."
3,That little green freak,"The part I most enjoyed about this book was the character development of Obi-Wan: He has human emotions, but he can rein them in with his Jedi discipline. I loved when the Emperor referred to Yoda as a ""green freak.""I disliked the switching back and forth between scenes. I know it's supposed to build tension, but it's just annoying. The Qui-Gon Jinn references were overdone. He was the most forgettable Jedi in the series to me.The success of the movie will greatly depend on the acting of Hayden Christensen. Now, that's scary. But at least the stilted dialogue of the first two episodes is mostly gone. Also the Jar Jar character has been minimized."
3,too bad it doesent say episode III on it,I COLLECT THE HARD BACK Star Wars books that go with each movie I almost didn't get this because it doesn't say episode III on it the first 2 list which ones they are but for some odd reason this one didn't.
4,star wars is fabulous,i love the star wars series and i am currently reading every novel published. i give the movie books episodes 1-6 four stars because george lucas is a fool when he wrote the movies such as making anakin a little complaining brat or including too many contradictions. these authors had to write based on the movie and it did not come out so well. but it is star wars and the general concepts are quite amazing. so george lucas isnt a complete fool. i recommend star wars to any individual who found something interesting in this series. i recommend this book just as another book you should read in the series because you should be reading every single one.
4,Looks like the movie is going to be pretty cool,"I got it in the mail yesterday and read it overnight. I was very pleased how everything is wrapped up and things are set up for the original Star Wars to begin.There are many ""Ah-Ha""! moments and many scenes of bravery and depravery. The story is much darker than any of the previous episodes but we were expecting that weren't we ;-)? The ending though is more satisfying than the best segment of the series, The Empire Stikes Back. I can't wait until the movie comes out on DVD and we can spend a New Year's eve some day watching Episodes 1-6 back to back.One caution though the Book is definitely PG-13. I would recommend the Scolastic or the Storybook versions for preteens. There are so many flying limbs and decapitations in the Book I am a bit apprehensive about taking my 7 year old and my 10 year old to see the movie.**************Spoiler***********They forgot to finish off Jar Jar Binks."
5,Great book,"I have read all the prequel books and they are all different in their own respect. This one was by far the darkest. It read (at least to me) almost like a horror book. I really wish there were aspects of the book that were put into the movie especially the seduction of Anakin by Palpatine. There are so much more details to how Anakin fell that were not in the movie which made it kind of weak. I really love the ending of the book when Anakin has turned into Darth Vader and he realized the ""truth"" about the Sith. It is really sad and I won't ruin it for anyone how has not read the book. I would recommend reading this book if you have watched the movie. It will help you understand the movie better."
2,Pass,I have been reading Star Wars novels on and off for about 20 years and really enjoy them Reecently we bought a series of Karen Travis's and saw thsi novel below. Sounded good but it is such a hard read and choppy and well just annoying to try and read.I have attempted a few times as I like the subject matter but just put it down.
2,Hero With no Fear-Oh please,"This book is about Anakin takin that final slide to the dark side, but it seems so straight forward for a Star Wars book. The authors style is the worst that I have personally ever seen, and I really didn't enjoy the book that I read in five hours, I would've rather read a Jedi Quest book. Mr. Stover used stupid little phrases like 'This is what its like to be Anaking Skywalker' to start entire chapters that centered on only the characters feelings, doing nothing to move the story along. His approach to everything was much too straight forward and the action was descrived horribly"
5,The end of the Repubic is now,"The novelization of the ""Star War:Revenge of the Sith"" by Matthew Stover is a great book. The book opens with a battle between the Separatists and the jedi masters Obi-Wan Kenobi Anikin Shywalker. The battle is won by the jedi's, but Anikin fears for the future and the life of his wife Padme Amidala. The dark side rising and the fate of the whole republic is at hand.This was a great book that makes me look foward to the movie. Its more darker than earlier movies, and that what makes it so great. The novelization was great. Can't wait for more."
3,Not the Best,"The author used an ambitious writing style, but apparently didn't have the talent to pull it off. The book ends up reading like amateur fan fiction. Very disappointing and distracting. BUT the book does provide more detail and background than the movie and is therefore a worthwhile read. It just could have been much better. They should have gotten the Attack of the Clone author to write it."
3,fluff,"annakin's conversion to the dark side was not convincing. the corruption of the human is one of the most fascinating and one of the most difficult subjects in literature to portray but this film flops in its attempt. i am not a star wars fan. all star wars films have too much fighting but this film has the most. i enjoy the scenery, the grand scale and the monstrous characters but the dialogue always fails. there should have been more wrangling in the senate. my senses need feed. i feel my serum gushing through crysto-canyons, splashing against knife-rocks, surging amidst storms of obsidian. i feel green gargoyles fire-breathing in jumbo, their eyes aflame with shock. banshees, victims of the thrash-night, howl through my scapes, refusing submission until their demands are gratified in copia.kyle foley, author of lorelei pursued and wrestles with God"
2,Where's the witty dialogue?,"The thing that hooked me on the Star Wars saga was the incredibly constant bickering and arguing that happens in episodes IV and V: C3PO and R2D2, Han Solo and Leia, Darth Vader and the other Imperial commanders.However, in episodes I, II, and now in III, the dialogue is flat. I was falling asleep while reading the conversations in this book. Episodes I, II and III apparently are nothing more than an attempt to see how many computer-generated droids can be blown up in each movie. What a pity. What a waste of my time."
4,ROTS Stover Style,"All Star Wars fans who like to read should read this book.Stover's style is deep; he likes to get inside the characters mind. (Acutally, Traitor's a better example of his style)If you liked ROTS and can get this book for a decent price go for it."
4,Movie? Eh. Book? SOLID!,"The book was much, MUCH better than the film; in fact, my ""average"" rating ofthe film is probably enhanced b/c I read the book first, and used it to fill in holes the film left gaping.Lucas' direction ruins his own universe. Stover brings it fully to life again, like Kershner did in his direction of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.Get the book; you will see what I mean."
3,The movie will be better,"There are some complaints I have to agree with that have been previously posted.1) Opening scene is too indepth and too long, which takes away from the rest of the story.2) Battle on Kashyyk omitted. This would have been good background on Wookies as well as introducing the most famous one.Some found the ""This is what it is like to be Anakin"" phrase annoying, I think used less it would have had more impact. Maybe using it at the begining to open the book and the last time at the end, other than that we KNOW what it is like, the book is about mainly him anyway.Due to these factors, the movie will be better that the book.Despite these factors though, the book was a good read even though the author needs a thesaurus especially where metal is concerned.I enjoyed it and plan on starting the daunting task of reading the inter-movie books."
5,Stunning ...,Has the wait been worth it? Yes!!! This is a stunning conclusion to the story some of us have been watching/reading since 1977. The novel opens well and gathers momentum as it hurtles toward an extremely moving climax. I can't wait to see how it unfolds on the screen ...
4,I did it for the kid,"I am not a huge Star Wars fan. You will never see me camping out for weeks in order to get movie tickets. But I had to ask my son if we were going to see the movie, after seeing the previews, he said ""You know it"". The movie had a PG-13 rating so I read this book prior to the film to see if he could go see it.The book was better than I thought with detailed space battles and betrayal. I found it more of a character study than an action novel, not to say that the action was lacking. I'm just sating that instead of cardboard figures running around with lightsabers, we got fully fleshed-out characters with reasons behind their actions. I would have to say the book was enjoyable and I can only hope that the movie captures the feeling of this book."
2,"Good try, Stover","First, Stover tried, but he was stuck with Lucas's storyline.Anakin Skywalker has been nuttier than a fruitcake since the second episode. He doesn't change here either. So when he joins Palpatine there is no real surprise.He is drawn Passionless. In fact when he does the unthinkable (at least to Lucas) I didn't bat an eyelash.I wish I could say that Stover is a bad writer, but alas, a blaster was held to his head by his contract with George Lucas.George Lucas should NEVER have directed these prequels, and should have shared screen writing responsibles with a talent.I love the play (dialogue) between Leia and Hans in the Empire Strikes Back.Aside from my dissatisfaction, if you enjoy the Star Wars universe I recommend you get the book and check out the trailers."
1,Too dark and violent,"This movie is too dark and violent for kids. The story is about how Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. The main character spends most of the movie either brooding or killing people, including children. Killing kids? Give me a break. Can't Hollywood think of anything positive for our kids to watch? My children are big fans of all the Star Wars movies but I won't let them watch this one again. The story line is also slow. My 6 year old fell asleep 1/3 of the way through, and I didn't bother to wake him up."
1,worse than the bad movie of the same name.,"Star Wars, Episode III - Revenge of the Sith as a movie was bad. but at least it on;ly wasted 2.5 hours of my time.this book is soooo silly and sooooo long.Pity the reader."
1,PLEASE LIST THE SONGS,Impossible to make a decision to buy if all you see is Golden Oldies by Various Artists!!!!!!!
4,New is not necessarily better than tried and true,"Anna Freud captures childhood in all its abundance from normality to pathology, its refreshing to see all sides of the cube."
1,a poor effort,"at no point in this movie does anyone's head explode in flames. truly great films such as welcome to spring break recognize the need for such scenes, but this movie clearly fails to understand the emotional resonance a burning head can create. if you want to see a truly great movie, check out welcome to spring break."
1,Wait for the Letterboxed Version,"For such a great film... Why did'nt they release this in a widescreen edition, as it original theatrical release. I will certainly purchase the ""Collector's Edition"" when it comes out."
2,Gone With the Wind (Blu-ray),"I really expected with blu-ray formatting for this to be wide screen, but it wasn't. Sadly disappointed!!!"
5,Made for a perfect evening,I purchased the dvd's new for 5.99. My 22 year old daughter was home from college for the holidays and we were talking about old classics. I had mentioned I would love to watch Gone With the Wind as I have not seen for many many years. She stated she had much about it but had never seen it. We couldn't find it at the video store so we ordered it. When it came she also invited a couple of her girlfriends who had never seen it also. We had a great girls night and everyone loved it! Of coarse the story is epic but the color and vividness of the dvd were great as well.
5,THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,this movie is very beautiful and emotional. they weren't lying when they called this the greatest movie of all time. everyone should watch it.
2,A classic that doesn't add up.,"Gone With The Wind is a film that is hailed by critics and audiences both as being a true masterpiece of cinema. The fact is though, that most people, in order not to be bashed, simply view the film with the thought in mind that if they actually find flaws in it, then they will be ridiculed by others. I think this film is very overrated, and is not that great. I love classic films, and I have seen more than enough to know what is good and what isn't. I thought the story dragged in places, the acting was over done, and there wasn't enough going on to keep the film interesting. While it did have great color and great camera work, it was still a bad film. One of the few classic films that I did not like, but this is just my opinion. I can honestly say I could have gone my whole life without ever seeing this film, and I would not lose any sleep over it. Judge for yourself."
5,Gone With the Wind,A classic. I had an old VCR copy that was taped off a television airing. Poor quality. I wanted to have the BluRay edition as part of my personal collection.
5,"A part of our history, A wonderful movie of all times...","The actors cannot ever be replaced from the original movie. I LOVE this movie more than any other movie I have ever seen, I guess because you can really see a lot of the truth in it. When Scarlett says, I'll worry about it tomorrow, thats her way of dealing with the pain of Rhett leaving. To survive this is the way you must think or else you would go insane. So much emotion involved in this movie. There will never be another ""GONE WITH THE WIND""......"
5,Gone With The Wind is the greatest!,"Gone With The Wind is the greatest movie that was ever made. Not only did it have a wonderful cast, but the costumes and sets were fantastic. Vivien Leigh is Scarlett O'Hara and she deserved her Oscar she received for her role. The fact that the story revolves around a woman who was independent and strong and who never gave up no matter how difficult things became, makes a great statement about Scarlett O'Hara. She may not have been the greatest person, but she did have courage to continue on fighting. Scarlett and her determination is what makes this movie great."
5,The most magnificent picture ever!,"Every time I watch this film, and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius that will live on for many generations to come."
4,Great movie-movie? Yup. Work of art? Hmmm...,"""Gone With the Wind"" seems beyond criticism, so central is it to the mythos of American filmmaking. It's huge, grand, sweeping, ambitious, diligent, and a little stupid around the edges. But it's certainly an eye- and earful. Consider it a guilty pleasure.Note to some critics of the DVD: Many have carped that the DVD is short on extras: True enough. But a widescreen version isn't one of them. Like virtually all films of its time, GWTW was shot using an aspect ratio that was pretty close to that of the modern tv screen. In the 1960's the film was rereleased in a widescreen version that was created by lopping off information at the top and the bottom of each frame; in other words, the new version contained less visual info than the old and pretty much wrecked the original's meticulous composition and art direction. It's a joke, and it doesn't belong on the DVD."
4,FIVE STARS for the movie . . . but only FOUR for the DVD,"One of the greatest movies of all time . . . but the DVD is disappointing for 2 reasons:1) For such a great film, the DVD does not contain many ""extras.""2) The ""new"" sound is not very impressive.Despite these disappointments, the movie itself is worth every penny of the purchase price."
5,Gone with the Wind Review,"This is an awsome movie. It depicts the Civil War, both before and after, what led up to it and theaftermath of the Civil War on the South."
5,Gone with the Wind,"This is definitely a great movie classic, of course, and will have an honored place in the DVD library. Recommend for everyone to see."
5,I love Gone With the Wind and on blue ray it is even better!!!,"This movie looks spectacular on blue ray, you can almost reach out and touch Scarlett when she is on the front porch in her white dress. I never noticed she has red shoes on, it is so clear. If you like this movie you will love it more on blue ray."
5,GWTW 70th Anniversary Edition DVD,A remarkable masterpiece of a film has been restored and enhanced for the viewers pleasure. The additional extras to the boxed set are a must have for any classic film buff. A perfect value for such a perfect southern film. A must have.
5,Gone with the wind,An excellent classic novel about certain individuals' hardships and recovery from a war torn nation.
5,Amazing Movie,I decided to watch this film because so many people were recommending it to me. I immediately fell in love with it. I think everyone should watch this movie!
4,GWTW is still a classic.,"The film is still as grand as the first time I saw it. The movie itself was great, the packaging and shipping was outstanding. I thought the picture quality of our particular disk was a bit grainy. Otherwise, no complaints."
5,Scarlett is my hero,This is the best civil war movie that was made if you consider the time that it was made. The dreary war movies of today may be more realistic but the colorful gowns and perfect hair fit the genre. It wasn't a film just about the horrors of war but the horrors of the survivors.
5,one of the 2 greatest romance movies ever made,a classic romance!! the performances are incredible!! never get tired of seeing it!!!
5,as good as ever,"30 years ago when I bought my first VCR it came with 10 ""free movie rentals"" and GWTW was the first movie I rented. So glad to have this on DVD."
4,Not as good as the book - but still good!,"I enjoyed the Gone with the Wind movie, but preferred the book. The movie left out quite a few details but the actors in the movie did a good job."
3,DOES NOT HAVE CAPTIONS,If you need captions to watch movies you should not buy it. The quality was good and no problems with the connection.
5,This is the one to buy!,"The definitive ""Gone with the Wind"" DVD collection. Everything you could possibly want about the movie. Great buy for the money!"
4,Gone With The Wind Blu-ray 1 Disc,"I have this movie on dvd, and after seeing it in blu-ray I won't watch the dvd version again. I thought the dvd version was pretty good until I saw the blu-ray. Now this is probably not the best movie in blu-ray but I have 2 decks in my system & when I freeze frame the same scene on both you can see the difference. It's a Classic movie & I would rather watch it on blu-ray than on anything else. Why wouldn't I. If you like the movie, you will like it better on blu-ray I think. This disc does not have any of the extras on it but I already have some of them on my dvd version so it didn't matter to me, it might to you though."
3,"Learn your film history, people!","I've seen several reviews on this which whine about the standard format (1:33:1 aspect ratio). Anybody who knows anything about film knows that 'widescreen' format was not developed until the 1950s as a way to differentiate the movies from the then much popular television. Thus, all classics such as Casablanca and Citizen Kane were made in the standard format.As far as this movie goes, I considered it one of the most overrated of all time. How anyone could sympathize with a brat like Scarlett is beyond me. Clark Gable is very good however as Rhett. The movie is very soap opera-ish and if made today would have been a TV mini-series rather than a feature film. It romanticizes the old South to such a degree that it makes the film hopelessly racist. Am I supposed to feel bad that Atlanta was burning? Boo-hoo."
2,almost four hours of lies,"It's a good film and a romantic story, but please, for truth's sake, don't learn anything about history from this nonsense."
2,NEW but not IMPROVED,"The technology of this release is great, but why they can't release this in widescreen is an abomination to the movie. This could be one of the most spectacular movie releases ever, but they keep messing it up by sticking with the pan-and-scan ""full"" screen version. One of these days someone will wise up and put out the ""right stuff"" widescreen version."
4,"Can't believe it, What's Old is New Again, BUT IS IT REALLY?","I was so excited, when my wife gave me permission to purchase a new DVD Changer. Finally, after all those years of hearing about the improvements to GONE WITH THE WIND, re-mastering and all that, we would, at last, be able to experience, for ourselves, the greatness of it all. WHEN right in the middle, the movie stops, so we may turn it over. THAT'S RIGHT, can you believe it- ALL that money was spent AND THEY FORGOT TO MAKE IT DUAL LAYER! What a ""bummer,"" this great movie on DVD is a ""FLIPPER!"" By the way, my copy is the newer version, with extras, and the ""keep case."" I really think that Turner should offer to make this right. I would GLADLY pay the extra cost, not to have to flip it over in the middle. Hey guys, it is a great movie, HOW ABOUT RELEASING IT AGAIN, this time ""dual layer"" -OK!"
2,Highly Overrated!,I watched Gone with the Wind and I didn't like it as much as I thought I would and I think this movie is very highly overrated!I wouldn't watch this movie again! Once was enough!
1,BORING,"I can't understand why everyone is so nuts about this movie. I fell asleep before Tape 2! That movie must have been good for its day, but not here. An overall bust."
2,Poor history,"GONE WITH THE WIND the movie is ok as a movie but a lot of people think that out of knee jerk reactions.The silly remakrs by Rhett about the North being ""richer"" or having more men to send into battle was FALSE.4 MILLION BLACK SLAVES (at least half men) were used by the Confederates for the dangerous and/or dirty tasks and the South had a lot of foreign EMPIRES in their pocket including the British one.Indeed it was Abe Lincolns tender heartedness that let the South advance a little too far -- and see how they paid him back!Shot him from behind and then rang ""church"" bells when they heard the news..."
3,Why isn't it Widescreen?,I love Gone with the wind. This product gets 3 stars from me (and not 5) because it is fullscreen format. I just don't understand why one of the greatest movies of all time cannot be purchased in widescreen format. I will celebrate in the streets the day I find a widescreen DVD of this movie.
1,Confine reviews to the technical aspects of the medium.,"We don't need reviews on how good or bad the movie was. It's been around since 1939. People have made up their minds about it. However, we do want to know about the technical aspects of the disc and the format. I have ordered this disc but in checking the technical information I was apalled to see that the aspect ratio is 1.33 to 1. Is that true? Mon Dieu! Then why buy this disc? That's why I've given it only one star. I'll change it if the actual format is greater."
3,Better Than Expected,"It opens by telling us that the South exists no more, except in books. I believe this particular version of the South never existed at all except in this book. But even so, it's more watchable than I expected. It may be idealistic and melodramatic, but I'm still glad I've seen it. Does anybody remember that, in this movie, Jesus took a bullet? Rhett Butler's a great character, plus that's Clark Gable. But Vivian Leigh also did a great job with the growth of Scarlett O'Hara. A little bit of Mitchell's actual prose made its way onto the screen, leading me to believe it's every bit as syrupy and unreadable as most folks who have read it claim. Apologies to those who think it's the greatest book and/or movie of all time, but I'm not one of you. However, at the end of this four-hour epic, when Rhett Butler walked out, I was sad. It is moving. I think she'll get him back. What about you? After all, tomorrow is another day."
3,Mixed bag,"This was a landmark in moviemaking because of its broad scope and epic spectacles. However, it happens to be based on a rambling, almost incoherent novel, and it reflects that fact. Nor was it helped by the fact that more than one director worked on it - you can see its tone shift sometimes, though not as much as its lengthy, convoluted plot does. Still, it's good Hollywood fun."
3,How can this be reviewed - It hasn't been released,"Amazon - wake up - stop attaching reviews from other products/formats. It's misleading, and misinforming.(Three stars because you can't leave ""no stars."")"
3,"Great Film, Only a Few Flaws With DVD Release","Okay, other reviewers have already explained why this movie is so incredible. I only give the DVD edition three stars, though. With a movie this old and with such a rich history, to have so few extras on the DVD is pretty cheap. One of the most glaring omissions is that there are subtitles in French... and none in Spanish! Last time I checked, this country had 30 million native Spanish speakers, which means that well over 10% of our population speaks Spanish as their first language. I'll admit that I might not have noticed this if it weren't for the fact that I teach in a school in which I have a few students who speak very little English. Regardless, though, why on earth would anyone release a DVD in the US with French subtitles and not Spanish ones? In general, the producers of the DVD certainly didn't break a sweat trying to make the release anything other than a digital version of a VHS release."
5,Fantastic,"I've loved this movie for as long as I could appreciate it and still believe it is one of the best movies of all time. Vivien Leigh portrays Scarlett flawlessly- just the right blend of volatility, beauty, and vulnerability. Clark Gable is dashing and perfect for the role of Rhett. The chemistry between him and Vivian is incredible. For the hopeless romantic, this is the movie to see! The only objection is the ending; it seems to leave many things unfinished and unsaid. Luckily, Alexandra Ripley does a magnificent sequel that ties up everything- I won't give away the ending in case you haven't read it! But please do!"
5,Outstanding,Really enjoyed this DVD. It is action packed and full of great acting. This is a classic movie. I would recommend the purchase of this movie.
5,My favorite,Great movie to watch on a long rainy sunday... have read the book ten times at least ... and adore the movie
3,Not So Special Anniversary Edition,"First let me say that if you do not own ""Gone With The Wind"" and want a nice copy, go ahead and buy this, you won't be disappointed. However - if like me, you were looking for a ""better""copy, think again. I already own a 1999 edition of the film, which was fine in terms of picture and audio, but I read about the 70th anniversary edition that just came out, and its claims of unsurpassed remastering improvements. So I ordered one, and when it arrived, I went back and forth, playing scenes from both versions - and there really seemed no difference in terms of picture or sound between the two. So I returned the new one."
4,"Great Movie, but the extra features not attractive to me","The movie is great, totally worth keeping a copy of. I like the music a lot too. I would hope that a collector's edition can include a music CD instead of many extra stuff. Two DVDs of them seem unnecessary to me: they can definitely be trimmed and squeezed into half a dvd."
5,Even BETTER transfer than laser disk!,"I've bought every version of GWTW (VHS, laser, and now DVD), and this new one is the BEST! Just to be sure, I got out my laser version (CAV) and compared it. The DVD wins hands down. One particular example really stands out for me--that scene at the Atlanta bazaar has the most beautiful Technicolor I can remember.It IS disappointing that there are no extras, other than the trailer and the enclosed booklet, but that can be forgiven for the most wondrous COLOR. Too bad they don't use real Technicolor in movies anymore.This DVD deserves an honored place in one's library!"
5,Gone With the Wind...and Swept AWAY!,"I was astounded when I first saw GOne With the Wind; it was the best, and remains the best, film I've ever had the opportunity to see. Vivien Leigh; my idol, stars in her first American film, with veteran actor, siren, Clark Gable. Olivia deHavilland gives miraculous life to Melanie and Leslie Howard, who seems a bit of a fruit in this film, is remarkable as strong and weary Ashley. This is THE FILM OF THE YEAR! :-)"
5,AMAZING,I was so happy when this came in the mail. I have always loved this movie. I lost my original copy so I was tickled to know I could get another one.
5,GONE WITH THE WIND,"Gone with the Wind Is a movie that you can watch over, over, again. I now have it on VHS & DVD. Bettie Seal"
1,sucked,"Quite possibly the most overrated movie of all time. Who wants to spend five hours listening to a bunch of spoiled, racist brats? I'd rather slap Scarlett than kiss her. If this is what The Old South was really like, then thank God those damn Yankees won. I'd of marched with Gen. Sherman anytime!"
2,There's always tomorrow...if you want to waste 4 hours.,"This movie is terrible. But, hey, it's long so that makes it okay."
3,I do not have the item yet.....,You are asking for a review and I have not received the item yet. After I receive the dvd I will rate again.
3,Gone With The Wind (Blu Ray),"I love Gone With The Wind. It is one of my favorite films. The three star rating I gave had nothing to do with the film, but with the blu ray edition I just brought. Even though the picture is beautiful, I hate the fact that it's not widescreen and there is no features. I feel that I should have just kept my standard DVD version. If you already own the DVD, dont get the blu ray (unless you want it for the beautiful picture)."
2,Great Movie One of the Greatest of All Time,"This is one of the best Movies of all time I would highly recommend it for the content and the story ( of the old South ) but the Blu-Ray edition of this Movie is very POOR, buy the regular DVD NOT the Blu-Ray on the Blu-Ray DVD the screen ratio does not fill the Screen when viewed."
3,Ok,Gone with the wind was a great movie if you like depressing movies where nothing goes right and no two characters are happy at the same moment it is one of my favorite movies but I thought it was extreemly depressing.
5,A classic romance..,"This story will always be one that is close to my heart.The main character, Scarlett, is one that my heart constantly conflicts over. I hate her a little and yet I love her so much! I find myself rooting for her throughout the whole story even though she is spoiled and takes others for granted. She isn't a very nice girl, to say the least. However, as the story progresses, she learns the value of hard work, and realizes her mistakes. In the end, I think there is a lesson to be learned.'Gone With the Wind' really pulls at my heartstrings and I have a difficult time not crying several times throughout."
3,A review of Gone With the Wind,"I agree with ""Simply A Classic"" review. Gone With the Wind does ignore the brutality of slavery and focuses on a romanticized view of slave life by ""staying away from unnecessary words or insinuations."" However, as ""Simply"" points out this movie was released in 1939, and at that time probably no movies addressed race and slavery realistically. Unfortunately, the romanticized view of slavery presented by GWTW influences our cultural memory of slavery and may negate the truth in, I believe, more realistic and culturally valuble narratives, like the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass."
5,One of the movies of all times.,"I give this movie, two big ones. Rent it if you haven't seen it before."
5,A Classic film in its own right,You really have to enjoy film to really sit through Gone with the Wind. This film has so much history in it. Not just dealing with the Civil War but also in regarding knowing the study of film.
3,Great A++,"best ever. Incapipal. Incredibal acting, writing, directing, and great screen shots! All the fire is real. My personal favorite. Seen it 7 times!"
2,GWTW,Good morningI didnt see anything special on this anniversary eddition. Dissapointed. The item was in good condition.RegardsAlejandra.
1,BAD RECORDING,"I love Gone With the Wind. I have it on VHS. I love it so much I decided to upgrade to DVD.What a mistake. The soundtrack has been speeded up so fast that I can't even understand it-and I almost know it by heart. This is a ROTTEN, disappointing copy that ruins a great movie.DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
1,GONE WITH THE WIND,"THE QUALITY OF COLOR IS VERY INFERIOR. IT HAS A YELLOW, NOT TRUE TECNICOLOR, TONE AND LOOKS LIKE A VERY POOR REPRODUCTION. I HAVE WATCHED THIS MOVIE REPLAYED ON HDTV AND IT IS ALTOGETHER BETTER THAN FROM THE DVD BLU-RAY. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!! I HAVE IT READY TO RETURN. CAN YOU GIVE ME ADVISE ON HOW BEST TO HANDLE THIS. ""GONE WITH THE WIND"""
1,"If you enjoy a good show, you best keep looking.","Gone With The Wind fables the story of a whiny southern belle in an era where she's the last one who should be whining.It's about 3 hours, thats like two tapes of her stomping and moaning over how some guy she loved ""frankly doesnt give a damn"". The film climaxes as she decides what to wear to the ball. This film, which has been hailed as one of the greatest films of all time by the society of morons, is comparable to any ""Ernest"" movie. That is, without the laughs. So if you own a copy throw it out."
1,Horrible Movie That should no be rated G.,Siskel And Ebert were dead wrong.If I were to rate it from 1 to 100 Id rate it 0.Not appropriate from children under the age of 76.Only good if u r 90 or older.Corny and yet it was a hit in the 70's.Where do they think of this junk. This movie is a horrible influence on children today. They should of never put it back in theatres and sell it where kids can get their hands on it.
1,Isn't the defense of slavery romantic!,"I wonder what kind of reception GWTW would have gotten had it come out in 1945 and been about a love affair between a man and woman in Nazi Germany. Imagine Rhett Butler as the dashing U-boat captain who constantly evades those pesky British destroyers in the North Atlantic. Picture Scarlett O'hara as the totally self-absorbed Fraulein who can't quite figure out what is in all those trains leaving town for central Europe because she is too busy thinking about a party dress. Despite the cinematic qualities of the film - which are undeniable - I cannot get past the fact that it romanticizes a society based on an evil institution. Achtung, darling, I don't give a damn."
5,She Loved it!,My wife is a Gone/Scarlet fan and truly loved this package - velvet cover impressed. She will charish forever.
5,Widescreen,To all the people who are complaining that this film is not in widescreen. You will never find this film in widescreen because no film was made in widescreen until the 1950's. Widescreen came about to lure people away from their new television sets and back to the movies.
5,The Classic That Never Disappoints,"If you remember this movie from years ago, you need to see it on DVD or Blueray. Many of the backdrops were painted on glass, in a time before computer generation! The artists must have been Rembrandts because the scenes are breathtaking in this new media form. And, the price is only that of a single movie ticket! This movie has a wide following, and like us, you can have a movie night with friends."
4,Still a must see movie,"This is a fine example of Hollywood old style movie making, an epic set during the Civil War era. The cast is perfect and the costumes/sets immerse you in that era. I also reviewed the novel and noted that Mitchell saw Blacks as inferior beings so her novel reflects this attitude. The movie softens this part somewhat, although my British friend didn't understand why one of the slave would fight with the South. They should have left out that part. It's also interesting to see that sexuality mores affected the script. In the novel Scarlett had children with each of her 3 husbands. In the movie she only has children with Rhett. The novel also portrays Scarlett as a questionable mother as her son is scared of her and Rhett notices her maternal flaws.Still it is a movie that should keep people entertained through this next century. No doubt it will endure for at least another 30 years."
4,Kanga,We have held an original copy pf Gone with the Wind so it was very pleasing to view an updated copy of the same grand cast ona Blue ray disc. We are a very elderly couple so probably enjoy all the old actors much more than the current generation However it is still a very good productdion.
4,"A lengthy, beautiful classic.","For years I had wanted to sit down and watch GWTW. It is considered the end all be all of movies. When I finally caught it on my DVR, I watched it over a couple nights. For a 4 hour movie, you are never bored. The performances are great, the scenes are so vibrant and gorgeously shot, and the dynamic between Rhett and Scarlett is just wonderful. I had to knock it down a star for the ending though. I cannot believe they left it at the point where Rhett just left. It made the movie feel incomplete, and after watching for 4 hours, the viewers deserved resolution.Most definitely worth watching if you are a movie fan though, of any age."
5,It's a classic - gotta own!,Digital quality is superb! One of my favs. The Anniversary Edition has a number of extras that makes it worth owning. Highly recommended if interested in owning a version of this movie.
4,A really Really good Movie,I think that this movie was a really good story about the cival war but I think that the Scarlett was a bit of a snob. The Characters were really well played and they acted out the parts really well. At the beginning of the movie the characters were very different then the were after the war which was at the end of the movie. For example Scarlett and her father were really close and they really loved each other very much but later on in the end of the movie he started to go a little crazy. I think that in reality there would not really be anybody like Rhett. I think that he was kind of a coward because he didn't go out to the war until near the end of the movie. But all in all I think that it was a really good movie.
4,Good but realy long,"I realy liked the movie. I want to read the book durring the summer or somthing but not when I have a lot to do. The movie was realy good but it was like when is this thing going to get over sometimes. Sad, dramatic and funny. I would recomend it if you can sit through long movies, unlike Julie who can't even sit through the first 15 min."
5,One of my favorite movies.,"I have seen this movie more times than I can remember. The love stories, beautiful costumes, the wonderful strong personalities of the characters and the history; everything about it. I bought this for my 12 year old grandddaughter. I hope she loves it as much as I do. Also bought the book for her."
5,One of the best movies ever made!,"Gone with the Wind is a truly wonderful and stunning movie. When you get to know the story of Scarlett O'Hara and the old South, you will get swept off your feet. The casting is one of the best in any movie I have seen. Who else but Vivien Leigh can play Scarlett and I don't think that Clark Gable's performance of Rhett Butler can ever be equalled.The costumes and scenery and music are the best and I'm not surprised that this movie won so many Oscars for them. If you haven't watched this film, I'm sure thath if you did, you would love it."
5,Always the best.,"Although I do like the book better, the movie of GWTW is probably one of the best of all time. I've been reading all the other reviews on this, and I'd just like to say to all the people who don't like this movie, whose reason is it's too long, Titanic, is almost as long as GWTW. Length is not a good way to rate a movie."
5,Missing the point,"I think the previous reviewers were sadly missing the point. Of course the two principal characters were less than perfect people--the beauty of the movie, all visual splendor aside, is the way it makes us care about these sometimes horrible people. Who wants to see another movie with cut-out characters who never waver in their ideals or morals? The relationships in Gone With the Wind are sometimes messy and sometimes infuriating, but never fail to be engaging."
5,Classic,"What is left to say about this great film - great film, great cast and great acting. Vivian Leigh IS still brilliant."
2,What's the big deal?,"Starring Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Leslie Howard (and others), I was looking forward to the movie. But it was not worth my time of watching for 2 hours, much less 4 whole hours. It seems that everyone loves the 1939 film of Gone with the Wind, but I don't see the apparent greatness. It held my interest for a while, but the story seemed to disintegrate with each of Scarlett's marriages. I found Hattie McDaniel's role as Mammy to be the most interesting out of all the characters. Overall, I don't feel like it was a satisfying movie to watch. At least I've now watched it once, and hopefully will not ever have to watch it again."
3,Gone with the wind movie.,"What can you say about this movie. It is timeless, and a monument to movie making. It can still stir emotion as I watch the spoiled brat Scarlett do her thing."
3,A classic,"Gone with the wind is certainly a classic film and it does have very nice sets, costumes and effects for that time period I just personally find the story a bit depressing."
2,Full screen Blu-ray?,"Gone with the Wind is a great film, but this Blu-ray is 1.33 fullscreen and does not have a wide screen option. Be ye warned!"
5,This is a classic!,"I didn't see this movie until I was past 30 - then got it first on VHS, then DVD and now Blu-ray. The Blu-ray is the best - picture quality is of course outstanding - but as a bonus - it is on one disc !"
5,My favorite,This is my favorite movie of all time and I love the picture and story but also the narrative behinds the scenes commentaries.
4,Classic,Gave up waiting for a widescreen version and settled on this one - a classic movie and still enjoyable in smaller screen version.
5,BluRay DVD: Gone with the wind.,"Outstanding quality in both color and detail. Absolutely no comparison between this and the standard DVD version I purchased a few years ago, not to mention that the entire movie fits on one BluRay DVD, and Amazon's price was almost too good to be true."
4,"This IS ""full screen/widescreen""","(Here's the info from the Internet on why this 1.33:1 DVD of GWTW REALLY IS the ""widescreen"" version - indeed, the ONLY fullframe version you will get)""Older"" movies (roughly up until the 1950's) used to be shot flat with a ratio very close to 4:3 (1.33:1). Thus, a 1.33:1 DVD of those movies will be perfectly acceptable, since no part of the image is being cropped for the TV display. An example of this would be ""Gone With the Wind."" It wasn't until TV became more popular that the movie studios had to find a way to draw people into the theaters; one of the ways they did this was by introducing widescreen pictures. In fact, in the case of GWTW, a widescreen version was later released to theaters, but in order to get it they had to crop the top and bottom of the full frame! So, if you want the full picture content as intended by the director, the proper aspect ratio for GWTW is 1.33:1."
1,Stop Your Money from Going with the Wind,"In my anxiousness to see this classic transformed into yet an even more special experience utilizing Blu-Ray technology, I foolishly purchased this disc. I am dissappointed to report that it was not worth spending the money. The technology is just not visible. It really is deceptive marketing and unnecessary. I suppose it is just not feasible to expect a movie made in the 30s to be greatly approved upon. Save your dinero and play your anniversary edition instead. Shame on MGM, shame on marketing execs and even shame on Amazon for misleading your faithful client base."
3,Good movie but....,"I have watched the movie a few times, read the book a dozen times in Vietnamese and English. I used to love the movie but am no longer feel the same about it. For starter, the movie made Scarlett heartless, selfish. Well, for those who never have gone without food and experienced the devastating of war, she does appear as such. But I know otherwise. And Rhett, who fell for her simply because they were alike, came off a dashing almost saint-like figure saved for his few moments with the red-headed whore Belle (who by the way was made into another saint-hearted creature in the movie). He was not that nice in the book. Though I like his character, I love Scarlett. And the movie just does not cut as good a story as the book. Buy the DVD to watch Gable and Leigh only."
1,Would not play past 20 minutes.,I would not have guessed a video download would 'hang up' and not play - but this would not play past 20 minutes. I tried numerous times. Amazon did respond and refund the rental charge promptly.
4,A Win with the Wind,"Blu-ray reproduction of picture and sound excellent.Gave it only 4 Stars as I was disappointed it was not in the Wide Screen Aspect Ratio. Original 4X3. To get the proper scope have to play back in wide screen format. However, it still remains one of the all time best stories"
2,Wait for a letterbox version,"If you love this classic film. Do not buy it until it is available in letterbox. The stunning cinematography and is lost with this full-screen ""pan and scan"" version. If feels like watching TV."
2,Not what I expected,"I love the book Gone With the Wind, but the movie isn't what I expected. Movies about books usually leave things out but not the main character's children! The movie tells the basic story, about Scarlett and Rhett, but skips so many things it's horrible to watch. (I think Ashley is really ugly, if you want that kind of information.) I don't think I'll be watching this movie again."
3,Doesn't take up the whole tv screen.,this bluray of gone with the wind was a huge dissapointment because it doesnt take up the whole picture on the tv screen and im talking from side to side not from up to bottom.its like its been put in the middle only and no amount of adjusting your bluray player to fix this will do any good.other movies may show up fine and take up the whole screen but this isnt one of them.its a huge dissapointment to me.especially since the regular dvd release of this movie does take up the whole screen from left to right.the video quality is great but the fact you war watching it like a middle size box in the middle of your tv screen takes away from how good the picture looks.any picture can look good when its condensed like this is.also the bluray is just one disc and doesnt feature anything at all as far as bonus features.
2,not as good as everyone says,"I was expecting soooo much more. But, after 3 hours it wasnt worth the end."
4,Historic in every sense of the word,"I won't waste your time on a review, everyone knows the greatness vested in this film. The 4 disc dvd is very nice and the interviews fabulous to watch. My only disappointment was the great Leslie Howard was left out all together. No facts no fiction just seamingly ignored. At the time he was as great a star and more famous than any other in the cast."
4,Gone With The Wind,"You know, call me old fashioned but when I sit down to watch a movie I expect to be sitting their for an hour-and-a-half, a maximum would be two hours. But this movie ranks as probably the LONGEST movie I have ever watched. I sat down at 6:00 PM and rose at 10:00 PM obviously sore and a little sleepy. The movie is extremely good , however. It would have recieved five stars had it not been so long. By the way, J'adore les singes."
3,Did I see the same movie as everyone else?,"I love romance novels, but had never seen this movie (even with 50 years to do so). It was certainly beautiful. Clark Gable is probably the 2nd sexiest man ever born (behind Sean Connery), but other than that.... Scarlett O'Hara was just one nasty gal. As for the BORING Ashley Wilkes, well how could he ever have interested either Scarlett or Melanie. It's awfully hard to enjoy a story, no matter how beautiful, with such a cast of irritating or boring characters. Rhett should have married Melanie, bought Tara and freed Mammy. Everyone else, I could care less.It was fun to see a young TV Superman in the beginning, however."
1,Gone With the Wind - Boxed Set BOMB,"To All Prospective GWTW Afficionados....DO NOT BUY THIS BOXED SET at the outrageous $71+ price. The glossy prints are poor quality...the other 'STUFF' included is just 'STUFF' and the really BAD THING....is that there is only 1 DVD. All the other releases currently (the more upscale and remastered ones) include 4 YES THAT IS FOUR DVD's which have information on interviews, making of the film, screen tests...etc. But this FANCY BOXED SET....has only one....Upon opening it, we immediately closed it and sent it back...and ordered the 4 DVD set at $27.94. So...save yourself some trouble and stick with the ORDINARY and AVOID the 'EXTRA-Ordinary'...Gladys C."
2,The movie is awesome but the DVD quality is BAD!!,"I was happy to buy this DVD at such a cheap price but it was wasn't worth it. The sound quality is really bad. I tried playing the DVD in several players thinking that the problem might be in my player. But no, blame it to the bad sound quality. Even with the full volume, the sound is low. One can hardly hear it sitting few meters away.Totally recommend this movie, but not the bad quality of the DVD."
5,Gone with the Wind Blu-ray,Gone with the Wind is my all time favorite movie. I was thrilled to receive it exactly as described. It arrived before the given date and was in perfect condition.
3,Widescreen,"Reading the comments about the missing Widescreen (Cinemascope) format I wonder what the silly talk about the 4:3-format-version is coming from. Most cinemas might not have had Screens for the Cinemascope-format, but the US-Laserdisc version that I baught a long time ago in NY had the (apparently) only Letterboxed (Cinemascope) Version ever available. I never had the time watch the whole thing, but I remember, that the title ""GONE WITH THE WIND"" rolled in Cinemascope from right to left through the screen. Of course it had thick black bars to fit into a 4:3 tv-set. Since I can't find it in the loft right now I can't even tell if it was done in CLV or CAV-format and how many discs it had, but it was a must-have-collector's item version. Since then I am waiting for this version on DVD or now rather Blu-Ray."
1,I must be in the minority.,"I must be in the minority about this movie-I don't like it. I don't like the people-in my opinion, they're shallow, ridiculous, narrow-minded and childish. I don't like the role of women in those days-all you had to do was wear pretty clothes and act like an airhead to catch a husband. If you don't do these things, you're an outcast. I especially don't like Scarlett O'Hara. I so can't believe that that woman couldn't make up her mind about what man to be with-I mean, Leslie Howard over Clark Gable? Give me a break! Casablanca is more my movie-at least Rick and Ilsa were more mature than Scarlett and Rhett. I don't like this film at all, and I don't understand what's so great about it."
1,Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!! What A Laugh!!,"How could anyone say this is the geatest movie of all time?! The script is absolutely corny, the whole story in general is VERY unrealistic and dumb, the acting is down right STUPID, got sooooo boring after the first 30 minutes, and speaking of minutes this worthless film is WAY to long! 4 and a half hours?!! Get real people!!! If you want to watch some REAL entertainment check out ""The Matrix"", ""Terminator 2"", ""Blade"", ""Gladiator"", or ""Independence Day"". Some advice from a 15 year-old."
1,Pretty sterotypical bull#$%^,"This along with birth of a nation should be destoryed , i have a hard time understanding how so many people can over look the many flaws this movie has. I guess most are just commenting on the stupid so called fairytale between the main character's"
4,Film classic,"Although this version is restored and digitally remastered, the color restoration is not as good as some other films such as My Fair Lady and The King and I. To be fair, however, this film was made in the 1930s and the films that look better when they are restored and remastered were from the 1960s and 1970s. It truly is a classic and I will keep it in my video library forever. It is certainly worth owning."
5,"If you give a damn, watch the movie",Gone WIth the WInd was the best movie I have ever seen! I've seen it3 timees and want to watchit more! I love Clark Gable so much I have a ring that I wear every day 24/7/365!!!! Please E-mail me with what you think
5,Collector DVD,"Gone With the Wind 4 DVD set was packaged nicely, and the contents were presented using good quality digital mastered video images."
5,A Classic,One of the best movies ever. Never loses its charm! I hope they never try a remake. I love it.
3,An extra star for technical advances,"I finally sat through this whole movie - the main plot was stupid, as were the main characters. I wanted to Rhett and Scarlet to get together at the end because I couldn't think of a better punishment for two such irredeemable characters. If you like Nicholas Spark's romances, then you'll like this. I gave an extra story for the technical accomplishments of the movie and its place as a historical work, but otherwise - not worth a rewatch."
2,Hello? Warner?,"Warners may regret having raised the bar so high with their recent issues of 2-disc sets of Casablanca and The Adventures of Robin Hood. I can't think of any film more deserving of the red carpet treatment than GWTW, at the very least including the excellent ""making of"" documentary, along with the old screen tests, a ""soundtrack only"" option, commentary, and possibly an interview with Olivia deHavilland.Let's go, Warners. This jewel needs a crown."
3,"Same disc, fancy packaging. Worth it?","I pre-ordered this new 2011 release blu-ray. Upon receipt it was exactly same disc as a previous release, but in a fancy shiny sleeve. I wasn't ready to pay extra for a sleeve which didn't add any value to the movie. So I returned the disc."
2,Uh. Cheesy Cheesy Cheesy!,"This movie is a real waste of film. It goes on and bleck bleck bleck. My mom cries in it, but the only scene that touches me in the slightest is the one where all the soldiers are lined up on the ground for as far as you can see. I really would not recommend anyone to see this, purely a waste of time."
2,Romantic Racism,"You have to give credit to this film for its glossy, epic sweep and the fact that it breaks new ground in filmmaking techniques. Unfortunately, the film, like the novel, promotes a destructive, romantic myth of a south that never really existed.In this Technicolor version of the Old South all the darkies are happy and smiling and dancing on the banks of the Mississippi, and obviously it's too bad the Civil War came along and ruined things. What a trashy message, and the terrible thing is that its wrapped in such a seductive and attractive package."
3,Neutral on this,Haven't opened yet. Sorry I don't have an opinion yet.I loved the movie and had in Beta only so I needed to get an updated version.
2,"Why no ""Special Edition""?","GWTW is my absolute, all-time favorite movie. I've seen it so many times I've lost count (and many of those were at movie theaters.) I've wanted to own this DVD since the first day I got a DVD player. I absolutely refuse, however, to buy this stripped down edition. One of the most celebrated movies of all-time and there are no ""special features"" or ""extras"" on the DVD? Surely I'm not the only one who feels this way."
3,Just doesn't measure up to the book.,"When I saw this movie after having recently finshed the book, I was frankly dissapointed. Gone With the wind (the movie)just doesn't capture the essence of the book. I'm not critisizing the acting-that part's fine, but so much is left out of the film. For example, the key fact that Scarlett had two other children. The children brought out a lot in many of the characters, something that was not the case in the film. I can't just put down this film in particular; I understand how hard it is to adapt a novel to the screen, but it is a rather dissapointing contrast to the wonderful book. If you are planning on seeing this movie, READ THE BOOK FIRST. It would spoil it to see the film without having read the book."
3,gone with the wind,"I cannot imagine what dificulties kept the producers of this dvd from creating a widescreen/letterbox edition. The first time I saw this film was at a drive-in in Wichita Falls, Texas. Nothing replaces that w-i-d-e-s-c-r-e-e-e-n!!!"
4,"Buy it for your wife, get rewarded!!!","Xmas present for my wife. I personally hate the movie but sitting through watching it with her got me some Thai food for dinner. So guys, take one for the team and buy it!!"
3,Will try again later,"I would love to rate this movie. Unfortunately I didn't get to watch the entire movie. It being 4 hours long, I had to pause it about a third of the way through. Never could get it to resume. Guess I should have downloaded it first and then it would have been on my device. Will try again later. The book is my favorite book ever and I would have loved to see the movie again....haven't seen it in a million years."
5,"A classic that holds up with time, buy the DVD!","If you bought this in VHS format when it first came out, get rid of the VHS version and buy this 2 disc edition. This is a film you will want to have in your collection for all time. It is crisp and beautiful, the color and sound is great and plays well. This film was made in a different time and era when beliefs and morality were looked on differently but enjoy it for itself and dont't try to judge it by todays standards. The performances speak for themselves and the richness of the film is always breathtaking. A timeless classic..."
2,gone with the price,"i was extremely dissapointed in the picture of GONE WITH THE WIND! the clairity of the picture is great, but the small (partial screen) is not acceptable to me, since the regular disc shows a FULL full screen, and not a small block of a picture!LARRY W."
1,one of the most Racist films of all-time,i gotta wonder about folks that enjoy this film.are they SlaveOwners or is that there Fantasy? there's nothing important about this Long-winded racist one -sided film.it's as bad as Birth Of a Nation.typical HollyWood.
1,"Awful, twice over!","I bought this for a Mother's Day gift--TWICE.My mom reported that most of the discs didn't work, so I returned it for a new set. Amazingly, the new replacement set didn't work either! I felt bad enough for Mom that I had to write this review and warn others.I finally learned my lesson: Take Mom out for dinner and a play instead of wasting time and money on this piece of....er, junk."
2,Language ruins it for me,"I think ""Gone With the Wind"" is about 99% of a great movie. I'd love for there to be a few more battle scenes, and perhaps a little less emphasis on the whiny Scarlett, but on the whole, it's alright.What I can't understand was the filmmakers' insistence on turning a nice period piece into an exploitation movie. I'm talking, of course, about the swearing by Clark Gable near the movie's end. Why? What was the point? Were the film's producers so dead set on pushing the envelope that they felt they had to degrade the movie in such a way? Imagine the Munchkins or Glenda from ""The Wizard of Oz"" saying such a thing. It's unimaginable.I'm aware that new movies have much more foul language than this, but that still doesn't make this any better. This movie could have been a pinnacle of the genre, rather than a shameless exercise in exploitation. I expect more from the classics, and so should you."
4,Excellent Value for GWTW Fans,"I purchased this from Goodwill. Honestly, if you are a fan, this is a must have. If you are a casual viewer like me, buy it cheap, the quality is worth it. If you want to watch it once, just get the standard edition."
4,Where is The Making Of ?,"I am glad that this is finally getting a Special Edition (will it be panned for widescreen), but WHERE is the brilliant 2+ Hour Making of Documentry?...Surely they could include this before release. Can someone in the know plese ask Warner Bros why this is not included or if we can get this from some other source!"
3,No scene selection?,"This is our third copy of Gone With the WInd - a VHS and DVD preceded this blue ray. Yes, the color is stunning, pictures crisp and clear. My wife is the big fan of this movie and watched over half of it by herself. Unable to finish it in one sitting, I had to put it back in the dvd player the following night. I asked her where she stopped and waited for the opening menu. It appeared in due course but there was no way to select a specific scene. I had to fast forward for over half of the movie. Really, for nearly $50 I expect scene selection. This is why I only gave it three stars."
5,gone with the wind review,I love this movie. I could watch it over and over and over. It came in wonderful condition thank you so much!
4,Really is a Classic,"I've just started to broaden my cinima horizons and thought why not start with a so called classic, Well to my surprise my first classic will probally be one of my all time favorites. Anyone who has seen it will agree, and anyone wanting to buy it really should. Great movie."
5,I know I reviewed this one before!,"It is my favorite movie and book of all time and I know I reviewed it earlier. This was a great set for anyone who loves ""GWTW"" at much as I do! Definitely recommend it!"
5,The greatest movie of all time,"Gone With The Wind is so wonderful, it's hard to believe it was made in the 30s. What I like most about this film is that the characters are so real that you think you know them personally. GWTW is about Scarlett O'Hara. She loves Ashley, but Ashley is married to his cousin, Melanie. So she married Melanie's brother Charles( a total loser) in spite. The war started, so the men goes off to fight and Charles died two weeks later. Scarlett moved in with Melanie in Atlanta. She ruined her reputation dancing with Rhett. Then more stuff happened. The plot is quite simple, but the strong characters saves this film along with other things. The music is great, the sceneries are nice, and the costumes are the best. Oh, did I mention that the acting is to near perfection by all the cast?"
2,"Great Movie, below average DVD","Wonderful movie, but below average DVD. When one buys a DVD they not only want to see the movie, but a bunch of little extras too. This DVD has virtually none of the extras that make a DVD worth buying.I was at least expecting a ""Making of"" segment.Just my humble oppinion."
2,Great film but enough is enough!,"I think ""Gone With The Wind"" is a great film but this 5 disc set is just another example of the studio's greed in rereleasing the same titles with a little extra. The first 4 discs in this set are identical in content to the ones from the previous ""Special 4 DVD set"". So if you have the earier set you will basically be paying $45+ for one disc with a few special features. Why bother. And if you wait a few years there will probably be a 6 disc set to replace this year's 5 disc set!"
2,"Good, but Not Great","HD is wonderful. But Anniversary Edition? That's hardly what it is. No extras. Just the movie. Misleading advertising. Then again, I only got it for the move in HD. Just call it what it is. It's not the big deal you may be expecting."
5,Well at least my mom does...,Plenty of Gone with the Wind for any fan although pretty sure they have an #? Anniversary addition out so might want to check that out first.
5,Excellent purchase experience,"I chose this item for my mother, who is a huge GWTW fan. It arrived quickly, well-packaged, and in time for Christmas."
4,This classic film never grows old,It was great to see this classic film again. The color and definition was excellent and seeing the old-fashioned ball gowns and the burning of Atlanta was spectacular. It was like watching a wonderful glorious soap opera and is definitely a film that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime. Certainly worth the cost of $9.99.
3,shape of old TV screen,"There is little point in reviewing the film, yes it's great even today. I had assumed that this anniversary edition would be wide screen like the original movie. It is not. It is the almost square box which fits an old TV set. It is available in wide screen, so I'm very disappointed. Having a blu-ray image which only uses the middle portion of my HGTV seems silly, next time I'll check more carefully. This movie should be seen as it was first shown."
5,The very fist Blockbuster !,"There's no need for a review on the movie, everybody knows how great this movie is, instead I'm going to review the Blu-Ray edition which is, in my opinion, a truly improvement on the film, literally, although the picture is not crystal sharp, is fair to say that this movie is very very good to look at, is clear, but there are some scenes that are not that clear and look kinda 'off', the sound got a huge improvement, with impressive clearity.I bought the single disc edition, I'm not big fan of 'special features' so this edition is perfect for me, I enjoyed the movie and the clarity of it.You like the movie ? you defenitevly you will love this movie in blu-ray !"
5,Amazing edition,"Probably one of the best editions of all time ... class presentation, complete with details that make it indispensable.Postcards, soundtrack, case for Bluray ...And of course, a restored edition, with a picture quality and amazing sound for a title of more than 70 years."
4,something's shortened,GWTW on blu-ray is gorgeous. Get this set to enjoy the movie in glorious technicolor as it was meant to be seen. My cavil has to do with the bonus disc enclosed with the package. When the Lion Roars is said to be a six-hour mini-series added as a bonus to the blu-ray package. But unless I am mistaken only three hours made it to the disc I received in my copy of the deluxe set. If you're going to give something give it or don't bother to include it at all. Otherwise this is probably the best edition of GWTW that will be available for a while so enjoy! enjoy!
5,A classic,Excellent restoration of the original. Bonus material on the actors and writer is also great.
3,Make sure you check for widescreen,This is my favorite movie and I just got a blu ray player and thought it would be awesome to view it on the blu ray. However I forgot to check whether or not it was widescreen (thinking that since blu ray was such a new technology it surely would be widescreen by default) Not So. I was very disappointed when I realized it was full screen. Lost so much of the beauty of the movie.
5,GWTW,My all time favorite movie. My all time favorite hero(Scarlett). I was looking to purchase this movie and found the special...the Scarlett Edition. I love this movie. great price.Now if only I could purchase Scarlett GWTW part 2 for this price it would be awesome. I wont pay upwards of $200.00 for the movie on DVD.
5,You will never see movie making like this again,"If you've never seen this movie do yourself a favor and see it. It is long but it moves fast. It has taken artistic license with the historical part but that doesen't even matter. It's really a magnificent love story between two beautiful, headstrong, passionate people. Watch it and be swept away. Films will never be made like this again, not in my lifetime anyway."
2,Greatness vs. Marketing: Take my Wallet ... Please,"I would not dare to knock the greatness of the film ""Gone With The Wind"" The movie stands all by itself. There isn't one imperfection when it comes to the acting, production and beauty of the restored visual and audio presentation. I salivate over the anticipation of the blu-ray release.BUT... give me a break on the packaging and price tab of the box set. Most of the addition material has already been released. The TBS mini series ""WHEN THE LION ROARED"" and the documentary ""1939: Hollywood's Greatest Year"" was just recently been released with the WIZARD OF OZ Blu-ray Collectors Set. Do we get a GWTW wrist watch also?Why do these companies always take advantage of consumers with taste. I think the movie is great but I would like the option of purchasing just the film for $25 and not the rest of the garbage for an additional $35. Would it be easier if I just sent Warner Bros. a blank check?"
2,Great film? I didn't think so.,"I finally saw this ""Hollywood Masterpiece"" over the weekend and can't help but believe that this is one of those movies that people think they are supposed to call ""great"", so they go ahead and call it great. But really, what is so great about this story?The main character, Scarlett, is a selfish tramp that makes a play at everyone else's men.The ""dashing"" Rhett Butler is a sleazy womanizer.The great ""romance"" between the two is based on her greed and his lust.There is little to know character growth for either of them.But hey, at least we get to see the deaths of a child and the film's only virtuous character before Rhett drops Scarlett like a hot potato.But hey, it's a ""classic"", therefore it MUST be good."
2,NOT WORTH IT,"This is a classic case of a studio repackaging something to make some extra coin.The print looks great, however you cannot play it in 16:9.All the other extras are available elsewhere for half the price. All your really paying for here is a velvet plastic box and some miniature reproductions of production letters, stills, and sketches.Spend your money elsewhere."
1,Great Movie: Lousy DVD,"The greatest movie ever made (OK I exaggerate, but not by much) not available in its original aspect ratio? It's a sin worse than colorization."
1,Pitiful,"According to most of the reviews I read on this Blu Ray movie it would be the bestI have ever seen. It is a little plainer than the regular DVD. I do not understandhow a Blu Ray movie that is 1080P is NOT widescreen. I notice this is becomingmore common place to remake a movie new and call it Blu Ray.On my DVD Blue Ray player, it is impossible to get anything in the way ofspecial features, I could not even get a scene selection.This was sold by Amazon."
2,Bad Design of Strap,The main strap of the shoe is tightens on the bike side of the shoe. And because if this the strap rubs on the crank arm on every pedal. This is a bad design.
5,Lifestyle Worship,"What a thought provoking book! Tozer seeks to inform the reader, or hearer in it's original delivery,that worship is more than a Sunday morning experience. There is more to worship than it's corporate function that most of us know it for. He has no qualms with laying it on the line with statements similar to this. If your not worshiping on Monday then you probably didn't have a genuine experience on Sunday.This book was written based on Tozer's desire to write it. It's content is based on a series of sermons he delivered about worship, but was unable to write due to his death. Worship is about a lifestyle dedicated unto God! Reading this book will give you opportunity to evaluate your relationship in worshiping God."
5,A must get,"I think this book is deep. Its not a book about you and how you can get God to do more for you. This book is all about God, but in saying that it means this book is all about you. Read it and read it slow. It will be boring because our excitement doesn't from reading about God, but from ourselves, so press on through the boredom until you hit pay dirt. The pay dirt is the desire to worship Him and in this desire we experience him and in experiencing Him, we are most content."
2,Book,This book was very good and explained 'worship' verywell so that all could understand exactly what worship is and how man is to react.I thoroughly enjoyed it completely and will use it asa resource. bjhTried to rate this book but it would not takeI loved it immensely.
2,Eh...,"Bring The Noise and Keep it in the Family kick butt...but that's about it. I've mentioned this in other reviews of Anthrax...I prefer Bush era Anthrax (the singer, not the president!), but I also consider ""Worship Music"" one of Anthrax's best discs ever, so I'm not against Joey Belladonna. However, whether it's the production or whatever, his voice just doesn't cut it for me on this disc. It doesn't have that feeling of fullness that it had on ""Worship Music"" where he sounded amazing. Anyway, I've heard far better from Anthrax and hold them to a high standard, but this is still worth buying for Bring the Noise."
4,Good Slapdash Set of Odds and Ends,"Anthrax, thrash metal, fun. Yes, we know.Now, what about the material on the disc? Overall, its pretty good. ""Milk (Ode To Billy)"" is about a boy who wants milk for his cereal. It sounds like standard Anthrax song. Meshing the goofyness with the sonic aggression brings a smile to my face. The rest of the album proceeds in a similar tasteful fashion. For the most part...The live tracks are okay, but they throw off the momentum of the studio tracks. And the re-make of ""I'm the Man"" blows.But man, the rest of the material is quite good. Any fan of the band, or even just any sort of faster-than-average metal, should consider adding this to their collection at some point."
4,only if yer a fan...,"take it for what its worth. live versions, b-sides, alternate versions of songs on earlier albums. i like it but im a fan of this particular band. four stars is generous on my part."
2,What happened here?,"[...]This album from anthrax just sucks. The songs Bring the noise and I'm the man 91 is lame. I'm the man 91 is a rap metal song that I guess is a sequel the I'm the man. It sounds like those limp biskit fags. And the songs with the highest quality are not even that decent. Oh yeah, bring the noise is another rap metal song that anthrax failed to do well. If you want rap metal from anthrax that's acually good, get I'm the man. It's awsome, funny, and the album includes a cover song from black sabbath. This time anthrax let me down."
3,The Songs Were Taken From This Album,"Those Songs By ATTACK OF THE KILLER B'S Was From The Albums Was Started With ""I'm The Man"" Was From The 1987 album AMONG THE LIVING, Always STATE OF EUPHORIA in 1988 ""Antisocial"",Specially ""Parasite"" and ""Pipeline Was Released In The 1989 Album PENIKUFESIN, and The Album PERSISTENCE OF TIME Was Released In 1990 with ""Keep It In The Family"" & ""Belly Of The Beast"" there all Releases In The 1980's & 1990's Also."
1,Not a Nero Wolfe book,"This should not have ""(Nero Wolfe)"" in the listing title as it is not a Nero Wolfe book. The author won an award."
5,most excellent,"At least for the beginner (myself), this was great for learning how to give a back massage."
1,Not Worth The Paper It Is Written on!,"If compared to 3 other Remote Access books, this one is a total failure! For my exam preparation I used all 4 books: This one, CiscoPress book, and Remote Access by Todd Lammle. To my opinion the best is Todd Lammles. CiscoPress is more like a very good manual. And if you want to polish your remote access knowledge - use Rossi's book."
1,Just waste my money,"I bought this book since I read comment from Mark J. Newcomb.Jump straight to Frame Relay topic and hope to gain some interesting information. But the explaining is very poor and diagrams just make me confuse.It's easier for me to follow the same topic on "" CCIE Lab Study Guide "" written by Stephen Hutnik and Michael Satterlee. Consider when you decide to buy this book."
1,Not so Sure About This Book,"I ordered this book as I was trying to avoid taking the class. After taking the CCNP course and checking the book versus the course as well as the exam which I took, I realized that much of what is on the exam is not covered in the book or the detail you need to know, such as that of the 700 series router commands are not covered. There are two other Remote Access books which seem to match much closer. The Cisco Press book and the Sybex book. If you need a quick study guide the Coriolis Remote Access book seemed pretty good as well."
2,Not to be Used as a Study Guide for BCRAN,This book was not very usefull as a study guide for the BCRAN exam even though I passed it on the first attempt with a great score. This book does give a decent overview of some of the technologies involved in the BCRAN yet the explaination of configurations and their examples are poorly represented.
2,BCRAN - Not an editors best job!,Not really what I had hoped for. The are quite a few errors in this book. Alot of the the examples in the case studies are incorrect. One example is the configuration of the frame-relay sub-interfaces. The case study shows the incorrect command to enter sub-interface configuration mode. This should be an obvious error for the editor (if they were technical enough to understand the information). There are many other errors and mistakes throughout the book. Too many examples that you have to turn a page or two from where the text is to see what they are talking about. - Very confusing! Not the best book on Cisco I have ever used.
2,This book is not a good resource,"If you are trying to pass your Remote Access course without taking the actual course this is not the book for you. This book gives pieces of the puzzle but is very disorganized and not very detailed. It is also lacking in several of the objectives. I can attribute this to rushing to beat their competitors on the shelf which they did but at a cost to the buyers. I looked at several other books such as those from Cisco, Todd Lammle, and Catherine Paquet. Those to me seemed to cover the objectives much better and were layed out better than this book."
1,These books are terrible!,Before you buy the Remote Access book from Tom Thomas read my comments on Tom Thomas's BCSN book.
3,Good read but riddled with errors.,"The authors did a fairly good job in making the dry content matter of BCRAN quite readable and easy to absorb. Out of the whole CCNP curriculum, this was by far the dullest of subjects, but at the hands of Thomas & Quiggle, it was handled nicely. All chapters were clearly written, though the practice questions at the ends of the chapters could have been tougher. The big problem, though, is the fact that this book is full of errors. Thankfully, they're mostly of the editorial kind, glaring at the reader from the page. They actually helped me to see whether I was following the text properly in my mind. If something was out of order, it immediately jumped at me. Obviously not everyone finds such errors ""helpful,"" and it's a shame that a decent book like this was probably rushed to the print and barely edited."
3,Not terribly happy with this one,"To begin with, two full pages of errors. Now, every book has some errors, it can't be helped. That's just the start. The examples given are unclear, often relating to figures several pages away. Commands are given without clear context sometimes and with context others. Case in point: Page 108, example 4-8 is clear. I know what I'm configin' because context is given. Page 299 in the text we have a Router(config-if)# example that does NOT clearly give the context and I wound up reading the surrounding paragraphs 3 times to clear it up. There are some great bits in the book... a page here, a page there... but overall the book is confused - and that's not a good thing for an instructional text. It needs a good re-write and someone to put the pictures where they belong. Cold? Harsh? Hey, I didn't send the book back, so it can't be that bad. TTFN"
3,Enough information to pass the exam,"This was the only material I used to study for the Remote Access exam and it was enough to pass. The material can be somewhat unclear at times, jumping from topic to topic, and the focus/feel of the book is slightly different to Cisco Press books that I have used for previous exams.The concepts are explained clearly enough and the detail is adequate for the exam."
4,"A Scary, Yet Understated Tale of a Serial Killer","This 1947 thriller by Dorothy B. Hughes is a master of its type--cold, unrelenting, yet tastefully done and nicely written. It isn't filled with blood and gore. Its violence is implied, forcing the gorefest fanatic elsewhere to sate his blood lust. Miss Hughes tells her story in a gripping style, placing ill-fated characters in a setting brimming with darkness and desperation, a cold tale that leads to a sudden, jaw-dropping climax. Don't confuse this novel with the 1950 film--Hollywood transformed the main characters as well as the theme, making the story a watered-down tale of domestic violence among the Hollywood set. Don't get me wrong--I've been a Bogart fan for many years. But I have to be honest. The film did not do this superb, chilling tale a shred of justice.David BerardelliAuthor of FATAL INNOCENCE"
5,Hard-boiled Noir,"Published in 1947, IN A LONELY PLACE is a hard-boiled noir that places the reader in the mind of WW2 veteran Dix Steele, a brilliantly realized psychopathic serial killer. The story, while slight, is more than compensated by the insighful character study and the daily details of Steele's parasitic life style in post-war Los Angeles."
3,Reading Blaster,"This is a good quality product, but it just did not interest my 4 year old son. He refuses to play it because he just doesn't like it. He loves the Jumpstart program and finished the entire Advanced Kindergarten level in just one month. I wanted to get more indepth help in reading so I ordered this product. Since it is also Knowledge Adventure like Jumpstart I thought he would love it and learn to read...wrong. This is a MUCH older program that does not hold the interest of children like the new programs. I did however find a great website called [...] and it is great and free! My son now uses this free program to work on reading skills. If your child has not been using a computer and playing video games since he was 2, it may be a great choice. But for those that have experience with video games, it will not hold their attention. It is a great program, just not for advanced children."
5,Great for those moving past signing with babies,"We started out signing with our first child as a baby, then wanted to continue learning American Sign Language together as a family, as a second language and as part of our homeschooling. I searched for a dictionary that would meet our family's needs as being easy to use, small enough to carry in the diaper bag, and good for those new to learning ASL. I reviewed other ASL dictionaries and this one best met our needs. What I like most is that it lists the greatest number of words. Because there are fewer words in the ASL vocabulary (for example, the same sign can mean beautiful AND pretty) sometimes we look up one of the words that does not have a direct ASL equivalent. This book refers the user to the correct word. In some other dictionaries, there is simply no entry so the user is left trying to figure out other words to look up. I also like the price and that the author is respected in her field."
2,My opinion on the paperback Dictionary of Sign Lanuage,"Words are to small, had I known I would have purchased a hardback with bigger writing of words. Thats the only thing."
3,Good for general use.,"This dictionary has a good concise introduction and lots of general and slang terms used. However, it would be very hard for people to read with even slight visual problems since the print is so tiny. The words in bold and descriptions of terms are good, but some are a little difficult for people to understand without any background in sign language. I would recommend this book for those who just need a quick reference to most words in general use because it is light and therefore easy to carry around, but have another book with larger print for sight impaired people."
4,Useful reference,"I'm a special education teacher with a hearing impaired student. I use this dictionary daily to aid instruction. I have been able to find most of the signs I was needing. The only negative is that the edition I bought is small enough to fit in my purse, which makes the illustrations rather tiny. Other than that, it's a good resource."
4,Good enough,"Took about a week or so to arrive, but came in good shape. No problems with seller. The dictionary is missing key words like ""to"" and ""that,"" which is kind of a disappointment."
4,great portable dictionary,"I have a different, larger dictionary for home. This is great for taking with me. Fits easily in most bags AND does very good job describing signs."
4,ASL dictionary,Good quick reference. I have several different dictionaries and I find something I like in each of them. This is more complete than some others.
3,A Decent Dictionary,"This is a decent sign language dictionary. I borrowed it from work (I'm an interpreter) and found it usefull. I bought this one because it had updated signs (signs, like any other language, changes over the years). Unfortunately, they dumped the state signs, country signs, and some other apendixes from this ""concise"" version which were the main reason I purchased this book. So, other than that big dissapointment it's still a usefull book."
3,"Nice book, wish there were a few changes.","This book is useful, but the signs in the book are a little faint and small. It's kind of hard to read but is useful to have around."
4,Nice doll.,These dolls are beautiful collectible type dolls but my daughter does play with them as well. They are not hardy but their clothing is beautiful and well made. We don't buy them for their educational value. They are just beautiful dolls for doll lovers.
2,Thirteen Year Old Janey is a Victim of Sexual Abuse,"This is a film that literally sees little wrong with child molesting. And no, I'm not even slightly exaggerating. It is also bizarre that I am the sole reviewer to point this out. Janey is only a 13 year old teenager. She is indeed rather mature for her age. Nonetheless, Janey is too young to legally allow a fully grown man to have sex with her. Such an adult male (or female) is clearly breaking the law. Janey is the daughter of a woman who is selfish and undisciplined. The father is being played for a fool. This dysfunctional family seems doomed. Janey's younger brother needs her love and protection. Is she capable of handling this responsibility? Will matters finally get out of control? ""Rain"" is morally bankrupt. The story line takes place in New Zealand. Perhaps the people associated with the American TV program ""To Catch a Predator"" and ""Perverted Justice"" should visit this country.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness"
3,Basic information about bettas with nice pictures,"This book offers basic information to starting hobbyists about the physiology, care, maintenance and breeding of the Betta splendens species, as well as the rearing of fry. The chapter on show standards and betta competitions has very nice pictures, including the albino strain that was successfully bred in Japan by Tanaka in 1994."
2,Mixed feelings,"The book did not offer any information in the way of betta care, which makes it a poor resource for the general fish owner. However, it is a valuable resource for people wishing to breed Bettas as it contains extensive information on this topic. Personally, I enjoyed reading the historical background surrounding Betta breeding and evolution. This is truly a remarkable species of fish, and the author brought this out nicely. In addition, the photographs were better than any I have seen and the text was well composed.However, like some other readers, I had a big problem with the information presented on Betta fighting. I know that the text is dated, written for a different era of betta owners (in the 1980s maybe?). Regardless, it was disturbing that such a practice would be discussed with such overt enthusiasm."
4,great pictures,"a lot of great pictures in this book. Great price and worth to buy, besides its only 5 bucks"
1,"Long on promise, non-existent on delivery","Unfortunately it just doesn't work. Using conductive gel and electric tweezers just isn't practical. The gel dries out too fast and when it does, it is no longer conductive. If you used it in a high-humidity environment you might a tiny bit more success but still dreadfully unsatisfactory. Finding a standard needle probe to replace the tweezers and gel would probably work. Save your money."
4,comfortable shoes,These shoes are very comfortable even wearing them for the first time. The make is slightly bigger than the actual size. I ordered a medium width which fits well though I thought I usually wear narrow width. I was going to order another pair in a different color but they were already sold out. It is a bargain [...]. They go well with pants and would be OK with causal dresses.
3,Tight in the toe area,"This is a very nice looking shoe but if you require room in the toe area you may find that there is not enough space. If you have bunions or hammertoes, this may not be the shoe for you."
3,"Pablo Escobar, a modern day Robin Hood",This movie is completely in Spanish with subtitles. I could not watch it because I would've spent the whole reading the dialog and not really be able to watch the moive.
1,Bad Customer Service,"I ordered this item from Otis and Claude through amazon and they never sent it to me. I called three times to inquire about the status of my order and was told each time that my order would be taken care of and they would get back to me immediately. I wish they had, but unfortunately they never did. It has been over a month now and Amazon has canceled my order as this seller never completed the order. This experience was very disappointing because instead of following up on my questions and attempts to confirm the order, they just swept me aside and for that lack of customer service, I give them 1 star. I only give them 1 star because this form would not allow me to give them no stars at all."
2,"not bad! but could've been better...Corpus Christi, Tx","I wonder what dvd the reviewer's talking about where he mentions the songs included as ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" being one of them? The only flaw in this dvd is that Sunday Morning Coming Down is not included. It is listed on the dvd, and he only sings the intro, or the first one or two verses and that's it. He gets away from the song and starts talking about something else. Most disheartening! As the only reason I bought this dvd was because of that song. I love that song. It's the story of his life, and many others. But ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" is KK. You let me down son!"
5,Excellent!,"While I have not yet taken the test for which this book prepares you, I found this book to be very informative, interesting, and extremely well written. Novell's entire line of Novell Certified Novell Press books has improved quite dramatically over the past year or so, and this book is definitely one of the best I have read so far. Jim Bowman deserves an applause and a lot of credit for this book - it is fantastic. Computer books are usually not all that interesting to read, but I really enjoyed this one and am looking forward to reading Jim's Certified Web Designer Study Guide (after I pass the Business Strategist test!)"
4,Don't bother with the class ... this is all you need!,"The book is a good review of the history of the 'Net, the various functionalities of Netscape Communicator 4.0, and planning/management of business web projects. Even if you've been at web work for a while, you'll pick up at least a few useful things. And Bowman is one of the best technical authors I've ever read--clear and with a good sense of audience.But while this prep book for the Internet Business Strategist certification didn't disappoint me, the exam *certainly* did. It was so easy, it cancelled out the one complaint I could have had about the book (that it didn't have a practice test). Don't waste your time and money going to the IBS class or getting a used White Book. Bowman's book really is all you need."
4,Good book...but waste of time.,"I bought this book and the practice software from boson.com, and while I passed the exam no problem, I feel the book concentrated on too much un-necessary and unimportant information; whereas, the study software was less expensive and focused on exactly what was covered on the test. Of course, a book should go more in depth, but I just feel that this book could have been much shorter."
1,Don't buy if you're a fan of Benny Hill!,"I was so pleased to find a biography of Benny Hill. I became a fan in the 80's when his show was televised by BBC. After 150+ pages, I can hardly bear to turn another. The author had no admiration for Mr. Hill; I would go so far as to say Mr. Lewisohn holds him in total contempt. The author also spends far too much time pontificating about Variety, radio and other topics in such minutiae that it detracts from the subject and makes this book a ponderous read with little enjoyment at best - excruciating at worst.Criticism is one thing but the way this author writes of Benny Hill, his life and comedy, is just shameful. I'm willing to bet he spared all of the Beatles his poison-pen treatment. What a disappointment."
2,Not happy,I purchased this item as a gift for someone very special to add to their collection and when it arrived the cover of the book was torn and there were red marks all over it (it is a white cover).Very displeased with my purchase.
5,So delicious it will make you smile and count your blessings!,"This is the MOST wonderful damson preserve I have tasted since my grandmother made it at home (east coast USA) in the early 1970's. Treat yourself to this gorgeous, deep ruby preserve and let the delight soak through you! Put it on toast or a warm biscuit with butter, and be transported to taste bud heaven and good, simple times past all at once. Thank you, Wilkin & Sons, for making a memory turn into a lovely reality for me."
3,Decent recording but least Yes-like album ever,"If one looks at this as a Trevor Rabin solo release with guest musicians from the Rabin-era version of Yes, that is how to most accurately describe this release in my opinion. With 90125 and Big Generator, there was clearly some input from other members, particularly Jon Anderson and Chris Squire. Jon Anderson and Chris Squire may have helped write some of the 'Talk' songs but there is almost no evidence of Chris Squire's signature bass and Jon Anderson's vocals are less out front than on the the other Rabin-era Yes recordings. Also, Tony Kaye is credited on Hammond organ but you'd be hard-pressed to hear an organ on most of 'Talk'. Trevor Rabin plays all the other keyboards. Only Alan White's drumming is the same as usual. As far as the music goes, aside from it not really being Yes as most of us know it, it's quite good, challenging at times but in my mind doesn't stand out as one of the highlights when compared with the remainder of Yes' catalog."
2,"** 1/2 , The well just started to run dry.","""Talk"" #33 (1994).13 th studio album, brought back Anderson, Rabin, Squire, Kaye and White. This album gave us the polished single ""The Calling"" #3 MSR, and ""Walls"", #24 MSR, ""State Of Play"", sounded good too. Last album with Trevor Rabin, Wakeman and Howe rejoined the band in 1996."
4,Classic Yes vs Yes West -- Who Cares?,"Just give me some good music...that's all I care about. This album is awesome. Don't get me wrong...it's not a masterpiece, but it proves that Yes can still reinvent themselves after all this time. It's amazing that they can come back from such a train wreck as 'Union' with such a great piece of work as 'Talk.'I know that when 'Talk' came out, Yes went more commercial than they had in a long time. But I think songs like 'The Calling' and 'Walls' strengthen the fact that Yes can successfully do commercially accessible music without compromising anything. In fact, 'Endless Dream' proves that the Anderson/Squire team is still as strong as it was when they were making the epics of the '70s. Truthfully, Steve Howe's presence on this album would have been a liability. Although he is a more accomplished guitarist, the style of the songs on 'Talk' call for a heavier sound, which Rabin provides without flaw.Nice work, guys. Keep up the good work!"
5,Trevor Rabin's Masterpiece,"This is as close to a true Yes album as the band produced in the 15 years Rabin was with the band. His genius as a producer is unequaled. And his composing is first-rate.""The Calling"" is the best short-form song Yes has made since ""Roundabout."" Very moving; I always choke up when I hear it (very loud, of course). And ""Endless Dream"" picks up where ""Awaken"" left off.If you hate this album, you're missing out on a true gem. Give it a few more tries.-"
3,One song doesn't make it YES,"I am so happy that I only have to review three YES albums with Trevor Rabin at the helm, before Jon refused him back into the band. ""Talk"" came at a time when I thought YES would never make another album, despite the incredible effort of ABWH and somewhat strange ""Union."" (Which Trevor hated.)There are a couple of heart-tugging songs on this album that ALMOST made me feel comfy with Trevor Rabin. ""I am Waiting"" is a wonderful ballad, and ""Endless Dream"" is the only progressive thing Trevor ever attempted with his version of ""YES.""Still, it is a Trevor Rabin album, from production, to mixing/mastering, digital recording...almost like Tom Sholtz playing in a band named ""Boston"" that really never played together.The two songs I mentioned are not worth getting the album for. For Trevor Rabin fans, go for it. For YES fans- skip to the 1996 album and ""live"" sessions. The band returned with a flourish!!!"
3,"OK, I'll talk.","I remember reading a two-word review of this CD in Spin magazine when it first came out. The reviewer's comments? ""Shut up."" I swear, that was the entire review! That same reviewer is probably writing glowing page-long reviews of Christina Agulara now.While TALK is not as bad as all that, it is far from being a classic Yes recording. ""State of Play"" and the three-part suite ""Endless Dream"" are among the better Yes songs of the 90's. But therein is the problem: Yes music has not been great through this decade. Most of the output from this period just seems to lack ambition.Granted, even weak Yes music is still far superior to much of the slop that has been released by the one-mega-hit-wonders who have since disappeared into obscurity. It is really a shame that groups like Yes are generally avoided by radio these days, but that is another story.Anyway, if you want good late model Yes, check out The Ladder or Magnification...both are better than this.Now, I'll shut up."
5,Keep Talking,"I think this is one of the most, if not the most, over looked, under listened Yes recording ever released. If you listen to this as music & not a jsut Yes recording then the music stands alone. It is a masterpiece. Listen to the music. Everytime I hear this recording & it comes to an end it makes you crave for more. More Talk please."
5,Extremely underrated - Yes' best of the nineties,"This is easily the best thing Yes did in the 1990s. Trevor Rabin is the driving force, and the album has a different tone than others by Yes.One cut is worth the entire CD, and that's Endless Dream. It's as good as any single cut Yes ever produced. The rest of the songs don't meet quite that standard, but there are several good ones, and none really objectionable.Every time I listen to this, I start missing Trevor Rabin. Recent Yes stuff just doesn't have this much spirit."
3,Not a worthy Yes album,"As someone who absolutely loves Yes, and loves almost their entire catalog of music, I was hoping reviews I'd read online were wrong. They were not! The songwriting on Talk is just not up to the usual Yes standard, and the songs sound overproduced and lack emotion and impact.I'm not sure how we these guys can go from the awesome ABWH (not officially a Yes album but close enough) to the lackluster albums Union and Talk, then release the excellent new studio tracks on the Keys To Ascension albums! Everybody releases a dude occasionally I guess, and I think I would call Talk a dude.If you like the Rabin era Yes, stick with 90125 and Big Generator."
4,YES-TALK,"ide never heard this cd before the 2 times ive just played it, its a good cd, like a cross of big generator and union + 90125 and the ladder. even though its not the same line up.but be warnd it aint like relayer,that l think is there best. if your a yes fan you will like it. do yourself a favour and get it ,you wont regret it.macca from australia. just do it,get it."
5,goosebump-inducing masterpiece of rock,"Talk is a unique album. From the opening tribal beats of ""The Calling"" to the astrophysical sonic twists of the closing ""endless dream"" this album defined what great rock music was and also marked the end of an era, that is, the end of ""classy"" rock. It sank in the charts that were dominated by grunge in 1994. The yes grand-dadies saw this as an opportunity to force Rabin out of the band. What a shame, cause only five people cared for (or even are aware of) the fact that yes continued to release albums after Talk.Too bad for Yes, cause Trevor wouldn't come back even they begged for him to. Heis too busy composing great pieces of music and having a good time doing it!"
4,Good work...,"It's often very hard to separate ideas about Yes and what it ""should"" be -- usually defined in terms of the 70s lineup that produced their greatest music -- from the music itself. But I think it's fair to do so. This is very good music, like all their albums from the 90s and 2000s."
3,Interesting...,"This product of the ""West Coast"" Yes seemingly was trying too hard to be hip and cool. The best Yes music came without a clear destination seemingly, while this album was a symptom of ""Hey, let's do a song about ---."" All it sounds like is a song about whatever, and never makes it to that next level. This, however, does not apply to the 'Talk' suite which closes the album out with a bang. This three track sonic behemoth is worth the price of the album in itself.I will add that there is a ha-ha warning about ""wide dynamic range."" They ain't kidding! This is a sonic workout for your system, with highs and lows that are both surprisingly real and clear.It is worth a listen."
4,Worth listenin again and again,"Had to replace my first copy that I gave away. ""Talk"" is very interesting in sound and lyrics and is a nice change from mainstream rock, as Yes has been for decades."
2,Rabin Solo Album + Yes,"If you are a Rabin fan or a fan of Rabin-era Yes, you will probably like this one. I think it sounds pretensious and uninspired. Chris Squire is missing in action. Alan White pulls some strong beats out of the can, but the rest is pure Rabin.There are some songs I can stand but most I can't listen to all the way through. I got this for [low price] in the bargin bin and I am not sure I got a good deal.-A long time Yes fan"
3,"Some good tracks, a great one and two fillers","I like a lot ""The Calling"", ""I am waiting"" is a great melodic song but Trevor Rabin is ruining it with one of the worst bridge that I ever heard in a Yes song !, ""Real Love"" is a good track also. ""State of play"" and ""Walls"" are the weakest track of the CD. ""Where will you be"" is also a good track. The real gem is ""Endless Dream"" really excellent with great transition. This is one of the great composition of the band. Two thumbs up for this on.One last point, the sound is so dynamic on this CD, there is even a warning on the cd, a good cd to put your subwoofer to the test !"
2,Yes - 'Talk' (Spitfire),"Believe that 'Talk' was guitarist Trevor Rabin's swan song with Yes.For some reason,'Talk' never did much for me.Liked their '90125' and 'Big Generator' CD's much better.A couple of tunes here that I sort of dug were ""I Am Waiting"" and ""Real Love"".This MAY have just been an attempt to virtually keep Yes fans 'interested' in the band as they followed this release up with an extensive summer tour.You know,how sometimes older bands do.Line-up:Jon Anderson-vocals,Chris Squire-bass,Trevor Rabin-guitar&CD producer,Tony Kaye-keyboards and Alan White-drums.'Talk' was reportedly a stiff,pretty much for Yes completists."
1,Overproduced and uninspired,"Although I must admit I haven't kept up with their most recent efforts, I did buy this one as an accident. And it was a mistake. The thing that I loved about early yes material was it's ability to build prog-rock on minimal chord structure flavored with french organ influences and a relatively impassioned feel. This, however, shows the continued downward spiral of a group that's forgotten it's roots and relies on massive over-the-top production rather than the dry, simple beauty of their early works. If you want a taste of old school yes as they should be, go out and buy ""Dots and Loops"" by Stereolab instead."
1,Yes worst album,"This is by far Yes worst album and something anyone should stay well clear of if they are not fully into mediocre AOR. People with large Foreigner, Europe and similar band record collection or heavily into hairdo cliche guitar playing, might be tempted.The record is one of the most cliche filled and trite albums ever, in addition being sterile and lifeless. Due to it's utter artistic failure it went quickly out of the catalogues but is now unfortunately back in print. It would have been less embarassing for Yes, who after all have produce some of the finest and most innovative rock music ever, if this album had remained out of print."
5,Left me speechless!,"I can honestly say I never thought much of the tragedy which happened in Oklahoma city so long ago. I always assumed it was an open and closed case. Well that was how I felt, until I saw the movie Zeitgeist. Looking for answers or truths behind accusations, I came across mentions of the Oklahoma City bombing, which eventually led to the watching of this film.It opened my eyes.I recommend this movie to anyone who feels the USA has lost its way. Hopefully it will get citizens talking and looking for educated solutions."
2,"diffuse, padded","There could be something substantial in this video, but it is slow moving and repetitive, and I couldn't spend any more time waiting for it to come good."
5,No more pillow print!,"Love this stuff! Don't think it will dry your nails *completely*, but it gets darn close. Base coat, two coats of color, and top coat... 10 minutes after applying the Drip Dry, you're good to go - even good to go to bed!"
3,Not as good as Seche Vite,"As another reviewer said, this works, but not as well as it says it does.I bought some of this to speed up the drying of my OPI polishes and OPI top coat. It is dry to the touch within a minute or so, but it is not hard enough to withstand bumps or smudges for a few hours at least. I went to bed about an hour after doing my nails and when I woke up my nails were marked and messed up.Seche Vite works much better for me. I can go to bed 30 minutes after doing my nails and wake up with them in perfect condition. The Seche Vite also produces a much shinier finish than what I get with the OPI top coat and Drip Dry.I will probably not buy this again."
3,Not everything it says it is...,"These drops feel nice when you apply them, and they do provide some protection from smudges, but not nearly as fast or as thoroughly as the label states. In about 5 minutes after application, the nailpolish is safe to touch, but it is not totally set by any means. This is after I did a base coat, 2 coats of color, and a top coat. I will use it since I have it, but I don't think that I will buy it again."
3,Opi drip dry,"I bought this product because of the good reviews I read. So I gave it a try...using base coat, 2 polishes, and top coat, wait about 3 mins then apply the drip dry. Well let say I still have to wait 10-15 mins for the top layer to dry to touch but it's actually not really a COMPLETE dry..underneath its still kinda wet. I tried to press the polish a little bit hard to see whether it's totally dry, and i could still see a finger print mark on the nail. I still have to wait about 30 mins or an hour more to a complete dry. I think the opi drip dry didn't help at all. I can do my nails and dry 'em at the same time without using it! Overall, not really impress with this product."
5,GREAT,"get the smaller one it lasts so long!!! also it works so well, my nails are dry before i put the cap back on!"
5,Dry in 30 Seconds,"This product helped me with my daily life. I'm always painting my nails different but right after im done painting them, somebody calls me around the house to do a chore! I would always mess up my nails and we all know that that's no fun. So now I just drip this on and in about 30 seconds i can go out and finish things that i needed to do! What would you rather do? 50 cents for 30 seconds of drying time or having to ruin you're nails and redo them which takes more time? I recommend this to anyone and everyone."
4,"Good, but not great","It does help dry the polish, but not in 5 minutes like it claims. More like 10 minutes or so. Still better than waiting for the polish to dry by itself."
5,amazing!,i don't buy things typically but through word of mouth and this is great stuff! this is def in my arsenal now...buy it...you'll be amazed and love it. i use to wake up with lines on my nails...not anymore!
1,Doesn't do what it says it does!,This item does not dry your nail polish as quickly as the package claims. I still had to wait a half an hour to fourty five minutes before they were no longer tacky to the touch and of course they were still wet below the surface for well over an hour and a half to two hours. Spent money to be in the same boat as I was before. Girls Save your money. Buy a fan you'll have better luck!
3,Beloved Physician...2nd in the series,"The saga continues to unfold of Dane and Tharyn's quest to spend their life together. Enjoyable story, but overshadowed with unending bibical quotes."
2,"Golden - Yes, Oldies - Yes, Get It - No.","As an avid listener and collector of Oldies music, I must say I was disappointed with this CD. It has some excellent songs, true, the digitally remastered quality is also good, but look at the tracks. There are only 10! That's approximately 28 minutes of music. That's why there are 10 volumes in this collection, because there is so little music on each album.There are better collections out there, and you should get one of them instead of this.The two stars are because I like the music, but there are definately better deals for your money.~C~"
2,poor design,"It works, and it takes messages, but I expected more.1) You need the manual to use this one - nothing is intuitive.i.e. There are TWO buttons labeled erase, and they only work in certain modes. huh?2) To set the time, you cannot use the key pad, you have to use the review side switch to go through minute-by-minute with the annoying/scary son of Dek Talk voice saying every minute... by the time it says minute FORteeFIVE I wished I had waited until 1 AM to set it.3) It has to tell you the instructions verbally every time you use it - I couldn't figure out how to turn the annoying voice off.4) Annoying voice.5) Even with all the audio information it does not have a beep function to signal new messages."
2,poor design,1. Remote operation: You cannot use a cell phone to check messages remotely on this phone (Southwest Bell Help Line) making this service useless for most operators.2. Limited technical help - required four days to have phone call returned.3. Poor sound quality on the digital message system.4. Garbled instructional messages built into the machine which cannot be turned off.
4,very nice multi-function corded telephone. great price.,"We bought this phone to replace a cordless phone that kept getting intermittent interference. It works great with no interference. We replaced the short cord that came with it with a 25 foot cord. We still don't have the freedom of a cordless, but we don't have the static either.I really like the look of the phone, stylish without going off the deep end. The automated voice for the instructions and default greeting could be a little more pleasant. Overall, I am really happy with the phone and so is my wife (which is the most important thing)."
3,It's not as good as my old one,"It does what it's supposed to do, but the remote access doesn't work too well. You can only delete all messages rather that deleting them individually, and you must keep the remote password that comes with the phone - you cannot change it to something you want."
2,Remote operation feature is garbage,"I've had this phone for 5 years or so. The phone itself is OK. But today I wanted to use the remote operation to check messages from 3200 miles away.It doesn't work. The manual says that the user must press and hold each number of the password for 2 seconds. Another reviewer mentioned that this doesn't work with cell phones--he's right--and I discovered it also does not work with modern cordless phones either. Modern phones send tones for just a brief fraction of a second, no matter how long you press the key.I don't have a phone around here old enough to check the messages. When I get back home, this phone is going in the garbage."
4,Good product,"Before i used this product, I had thrown away several half-bottles of nice wine because the oxygen had turned it. I don't buy the most expensive wines out there but its still disappointing when the wine that was so good just a few days ago is off. I recommend it!"
5,It works!,"I have been using this product for years. Contrary to instructions on the bottle, this product is not useful for white wines, which keep just fine in a fridge without gas. On the rare occasions when it has not worked I suspect that I did not completely displace all the air in the bottle.The system can be made more economical by decanting partial bottles into smaller ones. I have used 8-16 ounce juice and tea bottles with metal twist-off caps. This can greatly reduce the amount of gas needed to preserve a smaller quantity of wine."
3,"works well, but NOT 120+ uses as touted","i love this product - it's easy to use and has saved a lot of bottles. BUT it doesn't seem to last 120+ uses as stated on the cannister. towards the end, i lost some wine - it's hard to gauge when the cannister isn't giving off enough gas to adequately protect the wine from oxidation. but, until i can find a better replacement, it sure beats using the manual vacuum-creator/pump."
5,"Best wine preserver out there, bar none","I think I have tried every kind of wine preserver known to man, including all the vacuum pump models, some of which are pretty good. There is nothing else as easy to use and effective as this spray wine preserver. It takes about 5 seconds flat to seal a wine bottle and I really don't taste much deterioration at all in the following days. I will point out that no wine is going to taste the same weeks later: even with the preserver you should plan on finishing the wine within a week of opening it. But this is the only product I've found that makes it possible to actually continue to drink from the same bottle without a loss of quality over a few days after opening."
4,Good to Preserve Almost any Fluid Leftovers,"I'm using the argon and nitrogen mix to top off any left over fluid such as PVC cement, Plastic Dip, Rubber Cement, Paint or anything else I open up and store for another day."
2,hard to use,"The nozzle is very difficult to use. It takes so much pressure to dispense that I'm not able to keep it in place between the cork and the bottle while dispensing. Also, the flimsy little straw doesn't always connect right so the product sprays out at the connection rather than into the bottle. By the time I managed to get a few sprays into the bottle I'm pretty sure it wasn't done right, so I'm not surprised the wine had lost flavor 3 days later."
3,Vinospray,Bonjour en ce qui me conserne j'utilise le produit Vinospray sur le mme principe mais le diffuseur permettant d'injecter le gaz est bcp plus travaillé est permet de chasser l'oxygène préjudicable à la bonne conservation du vin d'une manière plus optimale
1,No Gas!,"Bought this on the advice of an expert. However, only about 2-3 seconds of gas - hardly the 120 uses. Maybe a pattern is emerging?"
3,Roller Coaster Quality,"I bought this book because of its coverage of exponentials and of hyperbolic equations-which it does very well.However, in the section marked 5.1.1., the author (and the editors) inexplicably differentiate a simple equation wrong and then persist in this mistake over and over again without correcting it. An unforgivable lapse in proof-reading that will leave many beginners in calculus scratching their heads, wondering, what the..........?"
1,?,"The teach yourself series usually provides a few well-worked-out problems, but invariably leaves one dangling and confused. My copy had inaccuracies in the solutions section.This book is not an ideal way to learn calculus. To learn calculus solidly, see Robert and Carol Ash'sThe Calculus Tutoring Book.To paraphrase Monty Python, ""This is not a book for reading. This is a book for laying down and avoiding."""
4,this was how I learned calculus,"So when I was 16 I asked my teacher how could I learn calculus. He pointed me to an earlier version of this book (by Abbott alone). Over the summer holidays at the end of 4th year high school, I read it cover to cover and learned calculus. I passed the book on to my daughter. I am now and have been for 20 years, a professor of theoretical chemistry. This is a good book."
1,This book is not helpful at all!,I am taking a college calculus course and this book is really not helping me.
1,UGH!!,This book is AWFUL!! I was VERY disappointed. Didnt help me AT ALL!! I went and got my money back immediately.
4,the white mice,"Being my wifes choice of book,, has shown interest in the life of people who have struggledthro life to help others,,quite a remarkable person [book not finished]"
1,This book fails on three counts:,"This book does not at all deliver what it advertises, on three counts: first, this book does not cover the essential features of DreamWeaver; secondly, the aspects of DreamWeaver it DOES cover are not well-written (at times they are downright confusing, misleading, or blatantly incorrect); thirdly, the info in this book not directly pertaining to DreamWeaver is VERY massive -- WHY is it here at all ??!! If I want to learn about Cascading Style Sheets, WHY would I choose a book on DreamWeaver (nevermind that the info on CSS is dated, and therefore incomplete).NO STARS !!"
1,"DW may be better than MS-FrontPage, but ....","I read somewhere that DreamWeaver was released to compete against Microsoft's FrontPage 97-98.Apparently the author was not aware of this fact, or else he would have done his homework and explore the POWER of DreamWeaver.I am working on a GeoCities web page dedicated to some ""tricks"" not covered in this book (or anywhere else). If anyone has any questions, requests, or comments, PLEASE email me. I'm here to help."
3,Not a book for expert.,"It took me only 4 days to finish the entire book, not that it's a thin book, but there are too much fundamental stuff in there that a professional webmaster wouldn't need. And if you know how to use Macromedia's family products (i.e. Director, Flash, etc.), this would not be a book of your choice, because probably there are only two, or three chapters for you to read... As for novices starting out to test out a new product without a little knowlege about tables, frames, and other stuff, this may be the book for you. Same as the other readers, the online source code was disappointedly not there... (6/2/98)"
3,Where is the on-line source code to accompany the book??,"If you are looking for a book on Dreamweaver, as of today, this is the only one in publication. It is significantly beter than most Que or Sams books I've gotten in the past, however it comes with no CD of examples and source code, and the web site does not seem to contain the source code the book refers to (As of 6/2/98). (According to the book, the code is supposed to be there) If anyone knows the location of the code for the examples, I would love to know where to get it. Without the source code, this book is around a five, with the code, it would be much more useful and get an 8 or 9. Overall, a good book for learning Dreamweaver, because it puts fourth clear explanations of features of Dreamweaver and how to use them."
2,Don,I enjoy books about people moving to the woods to get away from civilization. This book was boring to me and I did not finish it!
3,A Rainy Day Read,"You have to admire their spirits but wonder about the ways they chose to interact with wildlife. Feeding animals so you can get close to them is really going against the point of being one with nature. In the end, it could lead to the animal's demise. Don't really get that - but like that they were honest about what it really takes to have ""A Place in the Woods""."
3,Good service,"This is not the high capacity version battery.That info wasn't in the specifications, just the fact that it is a Nokia OEM battery. It is, but I wanted the high capacity one."
1,cheap copy of the original edition,"This edition does not come close to the original edition from the fourties. the original 'Little Man's Family' consisted of three booklets, each for a different age level. This booklet is the Reader, the one for the upper age level (3rd grade and up). The original booklet has been copied in a sloppy manner to produce this cheap knock off, the lines are much too thick in comparison to the original and does not do justice to the artist. Also: the original was a bilingual edition (Navajo and English, this booklet is in English only) the only thing that's right about this booklet is the price."
3,Gin-Sama wont sit :(,"I bought this Suigintou figure before reading the reviews... bad note on my behalf... I love Gin-Sama loads so I was very excited to get my first figure of her... The deliver was speedy as hell...1 week before it was meant to arrive according to Amazon. That was cool... BUT! she wont sit on the cross like in the picture... the base is not the same as in the picture... It is very small...All in all, I am happy to have Suigintou in my room... shame she will stay in her box until i find a way for her to not fall off...-edit-i used blue tack for the time being... she sits nicely on my computer desk now haha"
2,You won't learn much about Jimmy Stewart here,"Dispite its title you won't learn much about Jimmy Stewart here, the accounts are either very generic, or very superficial (e.g. ""I met him and he seemed like a real nice guy, and he never mentioned Hollywood""). Nothing in here about how and why or what he was feeling. It's a fact that he served with distinction, that he didn't have to, and that he sucessfully separated the two aspects of his life, maybe thats why this is such a difficult book to write, and to read."
5,A true American hero,"The story of a man who had it all and risked it all to do what he thought was his duty is one we can all learn from. Stewart had fame, fortune and a bright future in Hollywood. His determined efforts to fly in combat, even after being initially rejected by the Air Force, are inspiring. Reading this book makes you appreciate Jimmy Stewart the actor even more."
3,Good HTML instruction,"The first third of the book taught me HTML well. However, I am not sure how much value Web Design certification holds. So I chose not to bother with the certification exam.The second and third parts were a little hard for me to follow. I feel I could have gotten HTML instruction as good as from the first third of this book by purchasing a cheaper book devoted only to HTML."
5,Incredible,"This is a wonderful book about karma and past lives. It takes place in the 1960s, England and in the 1500s. This piece brings in historical facts, although the author does not note which are acurate and which are made up. It is a long book, over 500 pages, but a quick read. I finished it in a couple of nights. A definite page turner. If you like ""Knight in Shining Armour"" by Jude Devaraux you would love this piece. It is a similiar concept only better (if you can believe that). This was a beautiful and sad love story, not a bodice ripper."
2,Undecided,"I can't decide if I liked this novel or not. Was somewhat interesting, once you got to the 16th century - all the 20th century characters, including the main characters were annoying.Was confused and distracted by all the secondary characters in the 16th century as well. Would not consider this a romance, beings Stephen/Richard is hardly in the novel - this is more Celia's story in which Stephen is not around for most of the book - her interactions with many historical figures of the time were unbelievable due to her station in life - and her interaction with Thomas Wyatt (executed by Mary for starting rebellion to replace her with Elizabeth) was absolutely ridiculous, even for fiction.Bought this book and Katherine together based on recommendations and reviews, not sure I want to try Katherine now..maybe if I am between other novels.."
2,Wish I would have read the negative reviews...,"I saw so many positive reviews on this book that I just didn't bother reading the negative ones. It sounded so intriguing, but within the first 15 pages I felt like I'd been duped. I will say that the inner story that is set back in Tudor times was intriguing, but the out story was horrible. The writing was stiff and contrived, none of the characters were likable, and in all the behavior of pretty much everyone seemed unbelievable. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
4,A novel showing how reincarnation can affect a relationship.,"I read this book when I was twelve and interested in the idea of reincarnation and how actions from past lives might affect future lives. Twenty-six years later I've yet to find a novel that deals with past lives' effects on future lives as intelligently, AND include a love story. My only complaint is that the regression scenes are a bit sketchy,with the action focusing mostly on the Tudor period. There could be a bit more follow-up on how Celia's and Richard's marriage turned out. But the Tudor period scenes are wonderful. Celia's and Dr. Akananda's spirit journeys are interesting, with the 20th-century Celia acquiring inner peace and Dr. Akananda paying off his past-life debts. I just wish there were more novelists who would work with the subject of reincarnation."
1,"So many other great books out there, don't bother with this one","OK - I confess I did read the whole book, but asked myself why more than once. This is not a romantic book nor is it good historical fiction. The heroine past and present is utterly weak. Any book where the husband rapes the wife and then they get back together is just disgusting. I recommend Sharon Kay Penman, Candace Robb, and Colleen McCollough's brilliant series on ancient Rome beginning with ""The First Man in Rome"", and recently followed up by the fantastic ""Antony and Cleopatra""."
2,JUST WEIRD...,Maybe its because I don't believe in reincarnation. But I tried and tried to read this book and just could not get into it. The characters were just plain annoying! I read Katherine by the same author and just loved it...devoured it... so I was so excited to read this book. It was just weird. The good thing is it put me to sleep every night so I guess it was worth the money there. i also did not finish it soooo maybe it got better!!!
2,Too much fluff,"UGH! It was a painful process to go through all the extra stuff in this book. I wanted to quit reading several times, but kept plodding through. At one point I was so frustrated with all the extra this and that, that I almost threw the book across the room. Needless to say, I didn't...no, couldn't finish this book. I got 3/4 of the way through and couldn't take it anymore."
1,"So boring, so disappointing!","I started this book and put it down a third of the way through. I found it boring, boring, boring. I friend advised trying to finish, so I picked up where I left off and read another third of the book and found it no better. I decided not to waste any more time on a book I disliked. It was not only boring the characters didn't mesh, the plot was chaotic and confusing. This was the first book I read by Anya Seton and I doubt I will try another. It is also the first book I have ever put down without finishing. As an avid reader for over 50 years, and I especially love historical fiction, this was a real disappointment."
5,Love it!,I have read this book over and over again. It has been my favorite since I was about 14 or so.
2,Painful reading,"I loved Katherine, would rank that among the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. So when I finally read Green Darkness, I was anticipating something great. Wow, I was wrong. The book is just...weird. The reincarnation stuff is very bizarre and just doesn't fit to me. I am a history nut, and find the historical aspect of this book very unbelievable. I would give it one star, but for some reason I felt compelled to read the whole thing. Something must have kept me going!"
5,Long time favorite,"I am currently re-reading Green Darkness (lost track of how many times). I searched for years to find the original issue, and finally did several years ago. This is absolutely one of my all time favorite romance books. I am glad to see it being re-published for new readers to discover."
5,Anya Seton's works are being re-discovered.,Anya Seton's characters and settings are haunting in the very best sense of that word. You care about her leading women and the lives of those they effect. Green Darkness has a very unusual point of view which will attract today's spiritual seekers.I only wish there were more books by Anya Seton available. She was a remarkable talent.
2,Text Errors,"There are a fair number of digital text errors. That is to say, the words didn't convert properly. Not a huge deal but it is a little irritating. In retrospect, I wouldn't pay for that shoddy work if I knew. The book is fine and actually deserves more time spent in the process of converting to digital format."
3,green darkness book,"It was in ok condition.The front cover was torn.But it is readable and thats what matters the most.The part that was torn was easily taped and I must say this is a really good book.It's a great read that has all the making of a great book romance,mystery,suspense,and so much more.I really recommend it."
2,Difficult to get into,"Not an easy read. I found the first 100 pages of this book almost unbearable! Had I not enjoyed Anya Seton's book ""Katherine"" (which is one of the best books I had ever read) so much, I would have put this one down & never finished it. But since it was an Anya Seton novel, I decided to keep reading to see if it got any better. Well, it didn't. I was very disappointed in it. If you do want to read a good book by Seton, than I suggest ""Katherine"", a novel about Katherine Swynford, the second wife of John of Gaunt. This book is impossible to put down and one of my absolute favorites!"
1,Poorly Written,"I was sorely disappointed with this novel. I found it to be extremely droll, stilted, contrived, totally unsuspenseful, and completely dry. The love story was BORING, the lovers interacting twice in the whole escapade, which utterly contradicts the claim of the author of this being a ""gripping love story."" I was wondering why this did not appear on the New York Times bestseller list if it was so ""magnificent"", and now I know. I am really surprised to read any reviews here over two or three stars."
5,52 Ways To Protect Your Teen,"This incredible book was filled with WONDERFUL tips and ideas on improving communication between our 2 TEENAGE(14 and 16 years old) BOYS and US! The book has many real life comments from ""teenagers"" that helped us ,as parents, understand our boys perspective on all the issues of their lives. It really has improved ""Dad's"" ability to TALK with his sons with more patience, understanding and less criticism!! The boys love the idea that dinner together every night is a MUST!! A place for all of us to connect and know that love and support is there for them in this household!! THIS BOOK IS A MUST FOR ALL PARENTS!!"
1,Cheesy,"This is more of a class D movie for ""Don't Buy"".The entire movie focuses on 4 people inside of a mini van and a bear that comes out of the same bushes from time to time to attack the people.At the end of the movie,the woman says sorry and the bear lets her live.The bear finally gets in the driver seat of the mini van so that it can try and drive home.The acting and background music was very lame.The ""Edge"" with Anthony Hopkins is a good bear movie and worth buying."
4,Bear,came in good time and good shape no problems with payment or the dvd. can not say i was impressed on the movie its self.
2,Trying to be Cujo,"Okay, Cujo was a dog gone wrong, while this bear merely wanted revenge for the killing of his mate. But the rest of it seems more like what I wrote as my review title, with some drama thrown in: brother vs. brother and so on."
2,Ehh..,This movie was stupid. There's so many flaws it's rediculous. I dont even think this will ever be on TV. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because its more funny than scary.
3,Bear-able,"Those scenes that feature the live bear are the main reason to watch this movie. The bear is the best actor of the bunch.The script isn't very good. There's a lot of contrived animosity between the characters in this movie. That sort of fabricated conflict has become a common way of generating drama in Grade B projects. But the unrelieved carping and criticizing that goes on here, especially between the two brothers, is more tedious than usual. The more successful brother keeps up a stream of disapproval of his younger brother's lack of ambition and earning capacity. However everyone is so unpleasant to each other that it's hard to care what happens to any of the humans in this movie.Only the bear is a sympathetic character. He makes us root for nature on the rampage here. With that deserved victory at stake, the movie held my interest - bear-ly."
2,Aptly Titled,"This movie simply didn't grip me. I watch a lot of Chinese movies, and I'm well aware of the drama for Chinese living and society - for all the glam that is currently hyped on it now. Yet this movie had nothing to offer, but long silences, slow sequences and an implausible - nearly non-existent! - story line. Bleak countryside, a sullen protagonist, a desperate heroine all make for 2 hours better spent doing something else. What a disappointment from the director of 'In Love We Trust'!"
1,Serious flaws in the Kindle edition,"I do not believe the current Kindle edition of this book was ever actually reviewed by a human who understands e-books. I am planning to request a refund.Firstly there are awful character encoding issues. The first half of the book is scholarly introduction with what I assume are Greek words and phrases. I cannot tell for certain because they all show up as ""???????"" In the e-book. In some pages half the content appears as these question-mark words - useless!Secondly the process that produced this e-book for some unfathomable reason retained page numbers in the text content. Of course they never align with screens of text on the reader, they show up in the middle of paragraphs and verse stanzas, interrupting (and ruining) the reading.Amazon should pull the Kindle version of this book down until the publisher decides to produce a commercial-quality product."
3,"Bourne Legacy, anyone?",After spending what seemed like an ENTIRE evening watching Bourne Legacy...perhaps I should have just dug out my copy of Project: Kill
2,Only for fans of B action movies and Jeff Wincott,"Jeff Wincott is a hardcore gambler who is about to leave Vegas, but not without paying off a debt he owes. When he pays it off he ends up getting bullied into a fight. He loses the fight, his money, and his girlfriend.Ugh, this movie is pretty bad. Everything is predictable, and the acting by the girlfriend is horrible. The only good thing is Jeff Wincott. He gives a good acting performance, and like always he shows some great emotion in his fight scenes. There are a ton of fights in this movie, but none are really good. Gary Daniels gets a decent cameo fight, but the only fight I liked was the finale. Not even the finale was that good, but it picks up by the end of it. So in short, I recommend passing on this movie unless you are a really huge fan of Jeff Wincott.2/5Picture quality on the Madacy DVD is decent. Best thing about this DVD is that it has 45 minutes of trailers."
4,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,"I think Jeff Wincott is a good martial artist and shows charisma in this film. Its a different sort of storyline than the average B Grade but i like the way its been put together. Its about Jeffs character who is a local living in Las Vegas and has a bad habit for gambling, drinking and whatever else, one night as he was planning to leave the city for good with his wife he begs her for one last bet on an illegal fight organized by Rico (Steven Vincent Leigh) who he ends up fighting eventually but not only does he lose all his money, he mistakingly bet his wife as well! thinking he could beat Rico. It takes a while until he turns over a new leaf, gets back into training and tries to convince his wife he has changed for the better."
4,Entertaining and well written,Enjoyed the author's style and what he had to say. Good examples of adventures on the road addressing why we choose to ride.
4,Great read,"This is a light, fast paced, and highly enjoyable set of stories about one man's experiences on the road. It should strike a chord with anyone who rides, and inspire anyone who's always wanted to."
1,Redundant Road Kill,"I agree with another reveiwer that a possible redeeming quality of this book is that it is a quick read. I think I came close to skimming the last half of the book. The author seems more intent on repeating his weight, height, eating habits, and the fact that he is a Texan than on relating anything very meaningful or engaging. Self indulgence doesn't equal insightful reflection, nor do the frequent cryptic phrases add anything but confusion. And the attempts at philosophy are sophomoric.Having said that, I was able to finish the book because I too have logged several thousand miles astride a variety of bikes, most recently on a Honda Valkyrie, ""The Dragon"". Meyer would also have us believe ""The Dragon"" is his nickname for the bike, but a visit to the Valkyrieriders website can clarify some history. Sorry, big guy, the book didn't work for me.Do yourself a favor: pass this one up and read DETOURS by Richard La Plante."
4,Ready to ride,"Sure has me wanting to ride after a cold winter. Some of it believable, some of it not, but good reading none the less. Will probably get the other 3 ""Life is a Road"" books."
4,fantastic entertaining read,Felt like I was riding along - brought me back to many of my rides - Definately captures the soul of the ride!
4,VERY GOOD if not excellent,"These are the GOOD stuffs : ONE PAGE CRAM SHEET -very helpful, PARTITION TABLES explanation -Excellent, RMAN & Other Oracle 8 new features - EXCELLENT Qestions at the end of chapters and 60 questions at the end - EXCELLENTThis book was a supplement to my exam preparation and helped me to score 82%.These are the BAD stuffs : Oracle Objects and NET80 Enhancements explanations are not enough. You need to read more books for this."
1,Worst gun!,"Okay i bought this gun a couple days ago, when i recived it is seemed in order. No missing parts looked nice (instructions sucked) and i put my battery on the charger over night. When i got up i put the battery in loaded the clip and went out side, first shots where nice but then it just froze up. I opened it found a stuck bb easy to fix but when i put it together agin it did the same thing. The battery dide in like 3mins! then parts started falling out and now it wont even opperate maybe out of 10 shots youll get 2 that shot out. Worst gun i have ever seen or bought!This gun is a worthless work of S*&%! DO NOT BUY THIS GUN!"
5,i love this great cool Airsoft gun!,i love this airsoft gun! It's the best gun that ive ever shot! It's never broken down on me! i REALLY LOVE THIS AIRSOFT GUN! Me my brother my cousin and my dad had a war with them and i got killed by my cousin and his Aug airsoft gun. My ak47 was useless. It's not that i dont like it it's just i love my cousins gun better. Ryan mullins loves his Airsoft Aug
2,sucks,"I got this gun and it was awsum 4 a while, but now it shoots 3-5 bbs at a time. don't buy, CHEAP"
4,not bad,"first off to the idiot who said his gun didnt work because he charged it all night. These guns come with a very cheap battery, if you charge it for more than the allotted time (2 hours 35 minutes) you will destroy the battery.anyway the gun.This is an excelent gun for the cost, it out ranges any of the CYMA guns and simply dominates in a spring war (i would know i whipped this baby out in the middle of a pistol match and got 7 people) Its magazine is kinda difficult to load and spills bbs out if you remove it before it is empty. Also dont put the magazine in without the barrel in propperly or the mag empties into the gun. This thing has high fps around 220 -240 (yes i cronographed it) The only problem is mine doesnt really work on single because it double feeds apart from that this gun rocks."
5,M-azing,This gun is so amazing. I bought it and loved it. It is SOOOOO accurate and works great. The firing rate is great as well. All around great gun. The only problem is that it takes a liitle while to ship. But it is worth it.
3,i wouldnt recommend it,"considering this is an entry level electric airsoft gun i think you would be more happy with a spring gun for the same price. this gun is mostly plastic, which means it will break easily (depending on how much and where you use it) also it has low fps and range. when i got this gun it worked ok the first couple times i played with it, but eventually (even with a new battery) the bb's just fell out of the barrel. another thing about it is that you can only fire full automatic and trying semi (holding the trigger half way) will not work. a spring gun for a similar price will have better fps, range, and accuracy. plus you dont need to charge a spring gun."
1,The worst gun ever,"This gun is horrible. when it came out of the box it was okay, but from the start the battery lasted like 30 min. it shot with ok accuracy and power but then in about a week stopped shooting straight, most bbs rolled out of the barrel, the foregrip broke and the safety fell out. save your money and go buy the nypd submachine gun. this isn't margaret jha this is her son 14 years old"
5,Awsome gun.,Well. I have to say its not the best. but it sure does beat out spending around $300 for a Tokyo Marui. I just got this gun and i have used it many times already. It shoots very fast when the battery is charged fully and has really good accuracy. I was able to take out a pop can about fifty feet away. Only two problems. The scope doesn't zoom in and has a really small whole to look through and it doesn't even have cross hairs or a dot. I would suggest either getting a real scope from some sporting goods store or just use the sights that come with it (which are very good to use). the second problem is i never found anything that told me how long to charge the battery so i'm just gunna guesse and leave it charging for a while. Over all this is probably the best beginers AEG out there. and the cheapest for its quality.
4,Alpha squad leader here...,"One of my friends bought this in desert color and I got to hold it and shoot it once. the feel is great, except for the magazine rubbing against my wrist. and the magazine capacity is less than normal for an AEG. buy more mags- they save you in a war. By The Way, i think I know the kid who posted the above review... but all around a good AEG, 'cept the low magazine capacity. Hope this helped!"
4,PRETTY GOOD,this gun is alright. my friend has it and i've shot it a couple times and i like the feel. from about 20 feet it somewhat hurts and you can atleast feel it. i would rate the pain 6 out of ten being a little generous. i'd say buy it but think about getting a descent scope with it.
1,Don't bother unless you're looking for a plinker,"Okay, here's the bottom line. If you're just getting into airsoft, this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot. But if you're actually looking to get into the sport competitively, look for a Classic Army or Tokyo Marui AUG. It will be more expensive, but it will be quality. The number one rule of the airsoft world is: You get what you pay for. This is a cheap gun, and it's going to perform like a cheap gun. If you're looking for a decent cheap gun, let me recommend the UTG Warhawk, UTG MP5 or some of the CYMA MP5 line."
1,doesn't shoot,"when it does shoot, it's awesome. but i got it today and shot it about 200 times and it worked about 5"
1,SUCKED,This gun is sooooooooooooooooooo bad. first off it came two days late. then it never came wit a strap. first day it was great reall powerful and accurate. then next day it sucked. it shoot about 100 fps and went like 10 feet. my pistol wchi i got for for 2 dollars shoots better than this gun. DO NOT GET THIS GUN
1,gun,"Seriously, do you think anyone is going to read this HHHHHUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGEEEEE!!!! review below? Jezzzz... I'm sure not. Oh yeh, don't by this gun. Buy the Styler one. It looks the same but is way stronger and the same price."
1,Airsplat = Dismal Service,Airsplat's website showed the product in stock but it was actually backordered. I asked for a refund and after one month and several emails I finally received it. Terrible ... find your stuff somewhere else. An airsplat rep asked me to remove my rating!
5,Awesome gun!,"This gun is amazing but the only problem is that I can""t figure out how to remove the scope. Does somebody know how?"
3,air soft riffle,"Product was ok a little piece on the riffle was broken off and the package was a little dented in, but didnt really need the piece that was broken off and over all my nephew was pleased to get the riffle for his birthday."
4,very good but not amazing,the styer aug is an enty level gun that i bought a couple weeks ago the scope that comes with it you should trash right away this gun goes in the middle 200s it curves alot and is made of abs plastic now be carefull with the safty mine fell out the magazine that came with it fills if you push it in 50 .20 bbs fit so i bought a hi cap mag from airsplat.com the gun or at least mine when you fully charge it goes for a hour and a half but overall a very good start up gun also this is nothing like the tokyo marui that gun is expensive for it's perfomance
1,The Bridge of San Luis Rey,"The Cover - Could have been so much more intriquing if only the illustrator had read even the first paragraph of the book describing the bridge as an ancient suspended foot bridge made of ofier by the Incas etc. etc. not this London Bridge knock off. We readers aren't stupid and would appreciate a bit of consistancey between cover and story.The story read from an old copy is wonderful, and the editing is of a high standard not approached today."
1,very unreasonable and dissapointing,I did not like this book at all . It was assigned to me as a reading assignment over the summer. there was hardly a connection from the beginning to the end . It was very hard to understand and I am extremely dissapointed with Thornton. His books are expected to have higher potential than this.
2,brothersjudddotcom barely recommends,"When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, in Peru in 1714, and five travellers plummett to their deaths, Brother Juniper asks, ""Why did this happen to those five?"" Wilder proceeds to tell us the stories of these travellers & we are asked to examine whether there is any reason that God would choose these specific people for this fate.I remember reading this book in Junior High or High School and not getting it; I'm afraid I still don't. I suppose the book's well written, but I just don't care that these people die and the ultimate lesson we're left with--there is a bridge of love that binds the living and the dead--just seems completely platitudinous."
1,Can u say horrible?,"I had to read this book for a sophomore english class and all I can say is what a very, very uninteresting book. Basically all that happens is 5 people die on a small bridge and then the author goes on to discuss these people's lives. What a BORE. Unless you're some philosophical nerd, you will not enjoy this book at ALL. If I was the author of this book I'd tell myself to get a grip on the real world."
5,What Is God's Will? in a Classic Tale,"One of the great spiritual conundrums we all face is why one person dies while another lives. Airplane crashes, violent public events, and unexpected heart attacks in young people draw our attention to this question.The Bridge of San Luis Rey is probably the most elegant and moving expression of that question. Anyone who wants to develop her/his spirituality will find it satisfying and heartwarming to think about this story.If you have never read this book, you are missing an opportunity to be able to discuss this story with others. Even people who have read relatively little great fiction have usually read The Bridge of San Luis Rey.The story has little wasted verbiage, and gives you plenty to think about. I encourage you to read this little, but mightly book.You should also recommend it to young people you know. They can begin to discover a love of great literature through this book."
4,"Good, but not Great","Maybe I have to let it sink in more, but I haven't felt the same punch so to speak reading The Bridge of San Luis Ray as I did when I read Our Town. If you're a Wilder fan though, it's a good, quick read. Enjoyable and worth your time."
5,Beautiful,"In Peru, a bridge collapses and five people fall to their deaths. A priest decides this is the perfect opportunity to prove the existence of God, and he begins collecting stories of these five, in order to show that God was involved in their deaths for some reason.This book is a beautiful portrait of a handful of regular people, with moments of shining glory as well as many not-so-shining moments of normalcy as human beings. The descriptions of these people, their thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which they live their lives are clear and carefully layered, and I grew to like all of them very much. I especially liked seeing the ways in which their lives briefly touched each other.This is a lovely story of hope and the way people's lives evolve, even when faced with great adversity."
5,excellent novel,"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a masterpiece--beautifully written, evocative, and sensitive. A pleasure to read."
4,"Well written, but...","The book ""The Bridge of San Louis Rey"" plagues you with the question, ""Why those five?"" The book then goes into a small segment of the personal lives of all the victims of the bridge collapse, ultimately leaving it up to you to decide and think about. The book was extremely well written, with careful attention to vocabulary, and sentence formation. Therefore, I give the book a 4 out of 5. All that being said, I personally did not like the book, it's just not the genre that i like to spend my time reading."
1,Interesting storyline rambles on pointlessly,"The first chapter of Thorton Wilder's ""The Bridge of San Luis Rey"" was very interesting and absorbing. It tells of a monk who, after the collapsing of an historic bridge hurtles five people to their deaths, researches the personal lives of the dead and tries to discover if the tragedy was a coincidence or a sheer act of God. The next three, absolutely horrendous chapters, go on to describe the lives of the deceased. After reading three chapters filled with boring, gratuitous material, I hoped for an outstanding ending that would bring all the events together. But what I got was an ending that mocked me, seeming to ask, ""Why did you read this book?"""
3,platitudinous,"When the Bridge of San Luis Rey collapses, in Peru in 1714, and five travellers plummett to their deaths, Brother Juniper asks, ""Why did this happen to those five?"" Wilder proceeds to tell us the stories of these travellers & we are asked to examine whether there is any reason that God would choose these specific people for this fate.I remember reading this book in Junior High or High School and not getting it; I'm afraid I still don't. I suppose the book's well written, but I just don't care that these people die and the ultimate lesson we're left with--there is a bridge of love that binds the living and the dead--just seems completely platitudinous.GRADE: C"
3,an okay book,"The Bridge of San Luis Rey is a classic book about a monk who observes the bridge fall and looks into why they were the ones on the bridge. You may be asking ""What else?"" but there is nothing else. The book goes into the lives of the different people and the theories behind their dying.I had to read this book for school, and I had a hard time reading it. The reason why is probably because I am a hard-core action/scifi/fantasy lover. This book had absolutely no excitement. I guess the book is made to make you think, but it seemed awfully boring to me, but HEY, if you like theoretics and classics, this book is definitely for you."
3,Intriguing premise,"An intriguing premise is posited when The Bridge of San Luis Rey breaks and kills those on it: ""Either we live by accident and die by accident, or we live by plan and die by plan."" Brother Juniper then sets out to examine the lives and events that led to five people being on the bridge and looks for the predestined plan that explains this catastrophe."
3,Good to read if you have time to read slow,"I had to read this book for Sociology in high school. After reading this book, I found Monarch Notes on it and then I went back and reread the book which helped me to understand it alot. If you have trouble understanding this book, I suggest you do the same. It is interesting if you understand it."
5,A timeless classic,"Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey won the Pulitzer Prize in 1927. It is easy to see why. This short (148 pgs) novel begins with the collapse of a footbridge in Peru, where several people die. Brother Juniper, a monk who witnesses their deaths, ponders whether their death is the result of divine providence or merely unseeing fate. After one reading, I confess I have not grasped all the meanings and subtleties which I know are present (This book definitely goes no my re-reading or ""keeper"" shelf). I do know that Wilder's prose borders on poetry, and that this book is a work of beauty and truth."
3,OK,"Thornton Wilder being who he is, or was, I undertook reading this book to broaden my horizons. It din't work.Read other reviews, they're better than mine."
4,bridge of san louis rey,"this was a great read. it had its moments; but, it was well worth reading. it is good to read books written in another era."
4,Who did it?,"The bridge of san luis rey was a great book. Though it was a little confusing it had a sense of mystery in it. The plot was great and it sort of ""crossed the line"" at the time. The book was sort of an ""accident or intention"" book. This is one of my favorite books I have ever read."
5,Translation?,"This is a great piece of American 20th century fiction. Wilder is best known for Our Town, but won the Pulitzer for this work. One reviewer -- ""Whitaker""-- seems to believe Wilder's book was originally written in Spanish and is a piece of Latin American ""folklore"". Of course readers who read the back cover will know that Wilder was born in Wisconsin and as American as apple pie. The book was not translated into English, it was written in Wilder's brilliant american prose. A must-read."
1,"Strange, Sad","Strange writing style, very sad depressing story. Purchased for book club. Did not enjoy the stories of the people within the text."
2,What am I missing? I found the book dull and unsatisfying.,"I have read all the positive reviews and I am a bit stumped. I found the early chapter about the relationship between the mother and daughter very tedious and meaningless. I almost stopped reading after that chapter, but slogged on through the rest of the book with little uptick in enjoyment. I believe people just feel they have to love and praise the ""classics"" no matter what. I found the book dull and unsatisfying. I'm so glad it was a short book. The most enjoyable part of the book was looking up the many words I did not understand. I'm very glad I put the [...] app on my iPhone."
3,"good, but not really a classic for all","It would have been great to get even more of a historical perspective from the novel, which I found a little lacking. There seemed to be no real conclusion, which I thought was the goal of the monk's research into these people's lives. While it was certainly a good book, I don't think it was ""pulitzer prize, e.g. the best book of the year (but then I wasn't reading back then)"". The characters were only partly developed, I kept wondering what each of them was like."
2,"Interesting premise, poor execution, occasionally great","The premise is frequently discussed in the other reviews. The execution on this premise is so-so. The characters he chooses are all very depressed people with calamitous lives that touch upon one another. The book is seriously depressing. In addition, the pace is at times glacially slow. It was difficult to finish. The one saving grace is that here and there Wilder writes an utterly brilliant passage. But invariably these passages are set in such dark and uninteresting contexts that you wonder if they weren't penned separately and sort of forced into the story at specific junctures.But even for these passages the dullness and moroseness of the characters' stories hardly makes reading this book worthwhile. I cannot recommend it."
2,overrated,This book was way overrated. It was average at best. But it least it wasn't too long. It must have been a slow year for writing if this won the Pulitzer Prize.
5,a book lover,"one of the greatest books i will ever read. so deep and so beautifully written, everyone must read it!"
3,Not that great,"I am a fan of natural bristles face brushes. The firmness feels great and makes my skin feel smooth and squeaky clean. I was hoping the quality of this face brush would be a step above your run-of-the-mill cheap wooden handled brush with natural bristles, which quickly become water stained/moldy around the holes and cracked. Unfortunately I can't say this is much different than those cheap brushes. I got about 2 to 3 weeks of use out of it, which is right on par with the other ones. The bristles became frayed and matted. I don't think this is worth the price for such a short lifetime."
2,Didn't last a week!,"I've used this 3 times. Two tufts of bristles fell out already and the wood cracked down one side. Too bad, because the firmness was perfect for me. It is going back."
1,Tough brissels,"Bought this because I thought it was compact enough to take on travels. The brissels are so rough, you could scour a pan with it. After a little bit of time just in the shower, the brissels began to fall out."
1,Misleading advertisement on DVD-Audio!!,"Bummer! Besides the 9 audio tracks that offer a great signal/noise ratio and surround experience, all the rest of the material is not accessible if you use a DVD Video player...which I guess is owned by 99.9% of the DVD-owner population out there. Unlike another DVD-Audio I have from Yes (Magnification), the visual content of this ELP DVD-Audio is not compatible with ""any player"" with a DVD logo. I cannot open the photo gallery, lyrics, audio interview and album essay!Nothing to do with ELP and the B.S.S. record, which I own in CD and love. But this DVD-Audio disc cover and most ads for it on online retailers are misleading in terms of compatibility with DVD Video players."
3,remaster is subpar,"I agree with other reviewers that the volume increases in Jerusalem and the Karn Evil part 1 is very muddy. Also, the low end is too pronounced. I felt like I was listening to gangsta rap.Seems like Shout spent too much time on the packaging..."
2,Poor Remaster,"This is a wonderful album, remastered to cd, it's certainly the worst effort at remastering I've ever heard, i made the mistake of not reading reviews before my purchase, had I read them, I would have passed this up."
1,Whoever remastered this disc is totally incompetent.,"I'll agree with other reviews in that this is one of the most butchered remasters I've heard. Maybe the good mastering engineers just aren't around anymore. Overcompressed, overEQ'd, thin."
4,Brain Salad Surgery,"Brain Salad Surgery being ELP's 4th studio album and their 1973 release and is a fine example of progressive rock. The album can also be said to have experimental rock elements to it. The sound reminds me quite a bit of The Who, Yes and even early Kraftwerk before they went all electronic. Allmusic gave this album 4/5 and this is also my grade. 4/5."
5,ELP's Sgt. Pepper,I would place this album among the best in progressive rock. ELP's usual mind-blowing musicianship is at full force and they seem to push the experimental envelope even further. Lake's vocals are absolutely FLAWLESS. This album can also be known for the unbelievably crisp clear sounds that would be hard to top even with today's standards. (released in 73) Great all around!
2,Shoddy mastering!!,"This is a great album, obviously, but I have a few things to add about the mastering. I've read all the reviews of the Sanctuary import version, and a lot of the same problems are here, as well. The first four tracks are fully remastered on this Shout! version, but the entire Karn Evil 9 suite sounds like it was taken directly from vinyl! I can hear all the same imperfections I remember hearing on vinyl growing up. It sounds like they used the wrong tapes for Karn Evil 9, because that suite is NOT remastered. The difference is very obvious!!!"
5,HOLY COW! ELP like you've never heard before!,"WOW!! This really BLEW ME AWAY! This new DVD Audio format is outstanding, and what a perfect example Brain Salad Surgery makes. The first time I played it I listened to it 3 times all the way through! UNBELIEVABLE! I just could not get enough. I can't wait for more classics to come out on this format."
4,The Trio At Their Zenith,It is difficult to recommend this recording to anyone entirely unfamiliar with Emerson Lake & Palmer as one cannot appreciate them without exposure to the development that took place in their earlier albums.Suffice to say that this trio was in a league of its own by the time this album was released.If you are looking for easy listening - forget it! I was drained and shattered at the end of its first playing back in 1973.The innovative aspects of this meisterwerk are too numerous to detail here. Just accept the fact that this is where they peaked.Younger listeners may be amused by the close of Karn Evil where man finds himself in bemused conflict with a computer. Remeber this piece is 17 years old and has a distinctly prophetic edge to it.It just misses a 5 star rating from me only because I did not find the production as clean as Emerson Lake & Palmer or Tarkus. From a content point of view it is vastly more satisfying. Listen to it and be apprehensive.......
4,Art Rock For Punks,"Punk Art RockELP were the Ramones of the seventies ""art rock"" movement, which also featured wimpy jazzers Yes and Ye Olde English folk-rock hippies Jethro Tull. ""Toccata"" is alone worth the price of admission, a rave-up on a movement from a 20th century piano concerto, complete with highly atmospheric and very cool early Moog sfx. Also good for a lark are the panzer-driven Karnevil 9 suite. Hard to believe they wouldn't play this fairly straightword rendention of the old English hymn ""Jerusalem"" on the BBC in those days - a nice, if unspectacular version. The rest of the CD? Filler. But who cares: with ""Toccata"" and ""Karnevil 9,"" you're hearing the bad boys of art rock at their hysterical, overwrought zenith."
5,The best prog rock album ever,"ELP was at their creative peak during the making of this album. Emerson worked with a prototype moog synthesizer called the Apollo, Lake provided possibly his best ballad, and Palmer gave us synthesized percussion on a stainless steel drumkit. They brought in King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield to polish off the best ELP album ever. It was - and is - the crowning achievement in progressive rock."
5,DVD AUDIO Makes BSS New,"I've owned BSS from the first day it was available to the public, and I've listened to it maybe 5000 times over the last thirty years. Those who know this album, know what a great work it is, a wholly cohesive sonic vision of technological apocalypse written in complex counterpoint. Peformed on cutting-edge early 1970's technology, BSS contradicts its premise with exhuberance. But that's besides the point.We're here to talk about the DVD audio version. What a great sound this newest technology produces; I heard things on this album I had never heard before, and those sounds I was familiar with took on a new depth. And that was on my computer's DVD player.A treat for any ELP fan.Warning: To access the video material you must play the disc on a DVD Audio player."
5,Too Bad It's Out of Print...,"I first became aware of this album in the early '80s, and have enjoyed it from moment one. It's really a seminal piece in the world of classic progressive rock, and should be in every prog-rock lover's collection.I recently - and miraculously - came across a new copy of this DVD-Audio. When I put it in, I was blown away. The fidelity is beyond words; it's like a brand new album only recorded yesterday!It's too bad that DVD-Audio is all but on the way out, and that this title is out of print."
2,Horrible mastering,"I totally agree with other users comment about the horrible mastering of this CD.First, the overall volume is very low for a CD. Second, the voice is simply buried by the instruments while guitars, piano and organ volume are higher than everything else, including percussions.Track one is an abomination. The volume REALLY shift after 1m30 or something, and all the song is so damped that more than one audition is intolerable. I skip it and directly go to track 2 everytime.Just listen to the Amazon samples above and then, listen to the Rhino mix. You won't believe the difference !!I give it two stars because of the packaging which is an honest effort ..."
5,"...."" Welcome Back, My Friends, To The Show That Never Ends.....""","Of all the ELP LP's, and I've got my favourite tracks on every one, this is the ultimate ELP release. When I bought this in 1973, ""Karn Evil Nine"", just soared. It still does. I can still see Keith Emerson at the keyboard, being twirled around and around, at the famous 1974 concert ""The California Jam"". This is where they peaked!!"
4,Awesome album but...,"Everything here is gen-yoo-wine grade A-1 first class excellence. There's nothing better than to put this album on and read trashy SF or comics. Perfect veg-out soundtrack stuff.And then there's the @!!#$ annoying fifteen minute interview at the end. Why the @!!@# did these bozoes do that! We realize you're special and probably a bit shocked at all the stupid myopic critics who can't tell their nose from their armpit. Don't listen to them. They get the LP for free anyhow. If you really must put an interview on, stick it on a complementary second CD. Or better, a DVD (they can do that these days).Go back to the studio, tweak some knobs and rerelease this one as a 31 year anniversary remaster guys. (Guranteed: 5 stars)"
1,ELP DVD-A does not have a 2 channel audio option,"Beware all 2-channel audiophile enthusiasts! Even though the back cover and booklet of the ELP Brain Salad Surgery DVD-A note a 2 channel mix is available, a 2 channel mix is not available on the disc. The menu offers a 5.1 audio option, and for the video portion, a 2 channel mix."
2,Still Wrong,"This is still the wrong mix of this album. Hopefully, Shout! Factory will find the correct master."
2,What Kind Of Dressing Would You Like On That Salad?,"BSS is their best album. As a whole, it holds together okay but the flaws are still there. Emerson figures himself to be some sort of Paganini of the keyboard and the lyrics, particularly of Karn Evil 9 are pretentious words strung along. I realize that this is designed to be a lot more inaccessible than your average pop music. Yet, many of the songs are just words put together and are not meaningful. Lots of flash with this trio but little substance, I'm afraid."
3,No Video,"The sound quality on this DVD is 5 star quality and worth the money spent however, marketing this as a DVD and not having any moving video is mis-leading and therefore the grade of 3 stars. This is purely an ""audio"" product and should be advertised as such."
2,This album is awesome,"but this shout factory remaster I foolishly purchased isn't. The remastering quality is just awful. Jerusalem is thin, dry and gets slightly louder at about 1:31,karn evil 9: 1st impression muted, muffled and the drums and bass sound horrible, and the is also muffled and is strangely quiet. I have ordered the sony and it is on the way to my house. I have heard the sound is excellent and I own the sony ""from the beginning"" and it has karn evil 9 on it and it sounds wonderful. I can't wait for it to arrive!"
2,NOT THE ORIGINAL MIX,"Be warned! While this import sounds amazing, it's not the same mix as the album we all know and love. ""Jerusalem"" and ""Benny The Bouncer"" feature completely different vocals from Greg Lake."
5,Spectacular!Spectacular!,"After hearing this in album and cd form over 1,000 times I really did not expect any suprises. Boy was I wrong.20 seconds into the first song the hair on the back of my neck was standing up.Every instrument is much more defined,cleaner sounding and realistic. My only complaint on the remix is Carl Palmers aggressive timpini solo on Toccata the volume is to low.Other than that it`s perfect. Well thought out with great effects but not over done. It sounds like they re-recorded Greg Lakes voice for the first 45 seconds or so of Jerusalem.Why? I have no idea but it sounds great. I listened to this with a standard DVD player in 5.1 surrond sound. What it sounds like on the new DVD audio players I have no idea.Also I could not play the video part of the disk with my standard DVD player.Still this disk is worth twice the money you pay for it. If you allready own it on cd buy again in this format. I promiss you will not be dissapointed."
1,Something went horribly wrong,"In general I have been enjoying the Shout! remasters a lot, but in this, arguably ELP's masterpiece, somebody really messed things up with the remastering.I have been comparing the sound of the songs with the versions from 1993's Return of the Manticore (from Victory Music) and things are strange indeed: to my ears, in the new Shout! versions the sound in general is slightly more clear, but (big, BIG BUT) in Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression the sound is a disaster - completely muddy (however, as soon as 2nd Impression begins, the sound quality is fine once again).And in Jerusalem, even though the sound quality is fine, there is a sudden 3 or 4 decibel increase at the 1:32 mark, as previous reviewers have pointed out.The album presentation and essay are excellent, but its a shame that the contents of the little shiny round thing inside somehow escaped quality control. I would recommend staying away from this one until a corrected version is released."
2,Poor quality pressing,A fantastic band and a truly classic album but I had to return this item due to the quality of the vinyl LP pressing. Not only was there a large scratch on the first track that made it unplayable but there was a vicious level of surface hiss on the rest of the album. I have a newer Techniks turntable and the substandard audio quality is very evident.
3,Nice Racks,"Hi,I purchased these several years back and they are a very nice rack and works well, but wished it had two more belt hooks!"
4,Very good choice of tracks,"If you want to discover ELP, this cd has all you need, their most well known ballads, their classics and their bests tracks !A best of is always not complete, but this one has almost everything.I would have included ""Peter Gun"" instead of ""I believe in Father Christmas"" Overall, a very good ""best of"" !"
4,Beautifully Pretentious,"This album may not apeal to some people because of its bombastic, overblown and overlly pretentious content. However the megic of this album stems from the same place as it faults. Each song is overblown and overproduced, but would anybody want it any other way?As a best of compilation, it proves to be more than sufficient. It has more content than the vinyl best of compilations and also gives a well rounded introduction to ELP. Furthermore, it takes up almost all of the time available on a cd.Every single song is listenable to. None of the songs are songs that would not deserve to find a place on a compilation such as this.The reason I gave this album only four stars is just because I do not really give anything but the very best music the highest possible rating, and although this album was pretty amazing it still isn't perfect."
4,You want to know what prog rock sounds like?,"If you are curious about ELP, this CD is a good place to start. As a fan a of prog rock ELP is one of the core bands. If your a musican, this is a must listen to boarden you horizens."
3,"Good music, only fair audio quality","For content, I'd rate this between 4 and 5 stars for selected tracks. The only major weakness is the audio quality. Too often the instrumental work sounds like it was being played in a different, distant room particulary when overshadowed by the vocals. Given their individual and collective instrumental skill and signature sounds, this is a shame."
4,Four Stars For This Collection!!,"I must have been a pre-teen when I first heard ELP. My brother had 8-track tapes of Tarkus and Trilogy. This collection contains the song Tarkus which is one of the better tracks. From the Trilogy CD is From The Beginning...an excellent song which is legendary to classic rock fans. Other good selections are C' Est La Vie, Lucky Man (their ""hit"" song), Jerusalem, I could go on....I give four star this collection!!!"
3,GREAT MUSIC AND SELECTIONS/BAD MIXING ON THE VOCALS,"I was in a store recently that was playing talentless, computer driven rubbish like Britney Spears, rap, etc. - that was literally tormenting me. As soon as I got home I put this on and instantly felt better. Anyhow, ELP's music is incredible, however the mixing on the vocals here sounds terrible. I'm surprised no one else has mentioned it or maybe I just got a bad copy. The vocals are way too soft and muffled - when I turn the sound up loud enough to hear the vocals properly (yet they still sound muffled), the instrumentals are too loud. So really, I'd give this 5 stars for the music and 1 star for the poor sound quality. Replacing LP's with CD's is the worst thing that could've happened to music."
1,Dated,"Kind has not been kind to the ""progressive"" rock of the 1970's. What sounded like a major achievement quarter of a century ago today sounds pompous, overblown, and embarrassingly pretentious."
3,Not Quite Classical Music For The 70s,"This release focuses on some of the more accessible songs (Greg Lake's, mostly). Excludes a lot of the more bombastic and pretentious music in their catalog. Still, a lot of this stuff has not aged as well as material from other groups and does not hold together as well as the individual albums do."
2,Didn't do much for me,"This seemed to be a collection of essays that don't quite go anywhere. Maybe for somebody it's good but for me it felt like mix of artists and cultural studies types who don't really get online with some people who spend too much time online in mud's and other virutal 'worlds'. It seem to lack any theortical or intellectual backbone. Aside from that, if you get a list of the essays most of them can be found online. ;)"
4,Excellent and cheap,"You get what you pay for, and this headset has been awesome! The white and silver seems to be cheaper priced than the black and silver one (who knows why???), but I think the white one makes the headset less obvious!This headset fits perfectly on my small ears, it clamps on and has an ear piece that sits in your ear to hold it there. There is NO WAY this headset will move! It does not hurt my ear either.It has great reception, but you will have to use the headset in a quiet environment, so no sunroof or windows open. It picks up the external noise and you voice very well. It is perfect for the car, but dont try to use it at the mall or a rock concert.It works with my bluetooth enabled Razor phone. I tried the Motorola headset and it does not work nearly as well as this one, and this one is less expensive!"
5,another ronald shannon jackson masterpiece,"Red Warrior was a departure for Ronald Shannon Jackson. Originally released on Axiom records and produced by Bill Laswell, Red Warrior had more of a rock/metal edge than some of its predecessors. With three guitarists and two bassists and no horns, Red Warrior has rambling bluesy numbers like Gate to Heaven, funky rhythms and screaming metal guitars. As usual Jackson plays sharp polyrhythms that keep the group focused. While some of the soaring guitar solos are unfortunately a little reminiscent of joe satriani or steve vai--guitarists stevie salas toured with satriani--there is enough going on around it to keep things interesting. Of particular note is Elders, a 13 minute track with some superb bass solos. While different from some of the Decoding Society's more jazzy excursions, Red Warrior is an awesome album and is a great addition to any collection. Do yourself a service and pick up any recording you can find by this landmark group."
2,Brain Mind Lecture video caused me to have a seizure,"I have epilepsy. Thirteen years ago I had a left temporal lobectomy at Beth Israel Hospital.Since the surgery, I am unable to watch certain movies or TV programs when the picture is very blurry and not clear. If I were to watch a 3-D movie for instance, I would most probably have a grand mal seizure.When I watched the first video on TV, the picture quality was very poor. It made me very dizzy, and after watching for ten minutes, and standing up, I felt very disoriented. I then lay on the bed and had a petit mal seizure.How very ironic it was, that while watching about temporal lobe seizures, that I experienced one.When I watched it on the computer, I did not experience any problems."
5,A great pick!,This is a very well written personal story about this most awful period in our world's history.
1,"This book was meant to elicit fear, anxiety and drama out of some events not appearing factual. She is hateful and non-real.","I listenesd to an interview this author had some years ago and she sounds like she is so hateful and mean! She is mean to the maximum. No one denies some of the events in the book, but this woman is truly out of her mind, exaggerating and dramatizing and obsessing throughout. I have read many Holocaust books, but hers, just a waste,tone it down Lucille, you are too wierd and eccentric. Making the whole event sound like a circus!"
2,Pfaltzgraff Dinnerware Set,"One Plate already cracked. I ordered round Serving Bowl, to large! Coffee Mugs to big!"
5,Perfect for an Appalachian Trail fanatic,"A friend recently gave me the TREK DVD as a present. I've watched it three times already and I'm pumped.I thought it might be just scenery shots of the Appalachian Trail - like some stuff I've seen on the Travel Channel - but it has all kinds of interviews with hikers, and it follows a group of guys as they take a shot at a thru-hike. There is some great scenery of places I've always wanted to see on the trail, and it has some great stories too. Watch this (its about 90 minutes) and pack your backpack.If you don't want to hit the trail after watching this, then you're half dead already."
5,It makes me want to go hiking..... NOW!,"As a fellow Orange County girl I was psyched to find this video. Let me tell you what... it is AWESOME! The development of the guys and gals featured throughout the movie (and -- yes -- the antics) made the story personal and almost like you were there getting to know everyone. Having done a few AT section hikes, I can identify with a good portion of what the guys go through. The scenery is amazing too and it's hard to believe the cinematography that they accomplished with that little camera! But now I'm totally inspired to thru-hike the whole AT! Thanks guys! You did an awesome job!"
5,great for people considering the thru-hike,"Recently I decided that I was going to thru hike th App. trail, and I am leaving next week. I bought this dvd because I heard about it from someone. I thought it was great! It takes you into the various towns and such on the trail. It really has helped me alot on getting ready and my prep. Sometimes my hands sweat when I am watching this dvd....thats how real it is."
3,Good overview of an AT thru hike,"The documentary starts out a little slow but once you get used to the style I found it worth watching. It follows the journey of four young hikers through a variety of emotional and physical terrain as they make their way from Georgia to Maine. I have read a few books about AT thru hikes but this was my first video. I can say that after you watch this video you will have a much better feel for what it really takes to hike the trail from an emotional and physiological perspective. There is very little attention paid to any of the mechanics of hiking the AT including gear, route planning and re-supply. The video is very informal in nature so expect it to have a little of that home movie feel."
2,Could have been about skateboarding,"Would appeal to out of work 20 somethings who find hooting out loud a significant expression of inner experience. Could have been subtitled ""Hiking with your bar buddies, are we thirty ,yet?.""Some nice footage. better vids abound."
5,Finally she find her music style !!,"We could define this album as the best from Millie .First album that she combines different kinds of pop, ballad and country pop with excellent lyrics.Excellent production & lyrics by Rafael Perez - Botija.Excellent voice performance - MillieFeel free to buy it , it's worth it !!!"
5,Learn a lot,"I haven't finished it yet, but it's very interesting, complete approach, methodological and comprehensive. I would recommend it to any webmaster, web administrator or simply someone who wants to understand what's under the hood. Buy *unix ! Bye NT! :-)"
2,to broad,"Well, I personally think that the book is too broad. It tries to conver everything which should be left to separate books. I was expecting to get good details on tuning web servers / capacity planning etc but instead just re-read stuff that is in other books. The chapter on capacity planning is decent as well as the appendicies. However these should have been the core of the book. If you are a beginner to the Internet and want to know general performance stuff get it. If you are more of a veteren don't buy it."
3,Too general and too Unix specific,"Here are a whole bunch of general recommendations for tuning, however nothing specific, a lot of the general stuff they teach you in your basic CS curriculum. CPU registers are faster than memory, SCSI is faster than disk, etc. There is some useful stuff on network performance tuning. Also, a few terrible typos in the book that really should have been caught. The numbers also seem out of date for a book published in Oct 98 (100Mhz PC processors being top of the line in this book)Not much material here on optimizing NT or NT hardware, which would be nice.If you've never optimized a system, the info here might be useful, otherwise most of it isn't new."
2,"Abstract and confusing text, difficult to follow","This is a book written in a deliberately difficult style. Notation used for equations of motion and stability derivatives is non-standard. There is little in the way of solved examplesthat can illustrate the basic principles to a student. A reader easily gets lost in the myriad of confusing mathematical details, without grasping the physical fundamentals. Not a very useful textbook in an introductory course on flight dynamics and controls."
3,Poorly Compiled but Addresses Important Topics,"This book appears to have been hastily put together from sketchy classnotes. As one of the previous reviewers pointed out, I'm sure this will prove to be an immensely useful book if you also happen to be fortunate enough to be taking Dr. Roskam's course.The book does address some very important topics in aerodynamics and aircraft control theory. Unfortunately many key aspects are glossed over and the text is full of redundancies - for example, the definition of the aerodynamic center occurs at least 3 times. The same typographic font is used for both the equations and accompanying text, making the textbook very difficult to read.None of this should detract from the fact that Dr. Roskam is undoubtedly a pioneering educator in the field of modern aerodynamics and aircraft control. I sincerely hope that some of his current or former graduate students will assist him in putting forth a more comprehensible edition of this important textbook."
2,Disappointed in content,"This is not /really/ a book on how to impliment NTP. Over half the book is devoted to the history of NTP. There's even one chapter on the science of time, the history of the gregorian calendar and other trivial information. There's even a poem thrown in there for good measure.Chapter five has a big commercial for Symmetricom's NTP appliance.I was looking for was a exhaustive guide for implimenting *ntpd. I wanted to know how to understand the output of all the different commands on the ntpd console. I wanted to know how to troubleshoot the clock skew on my Dell servers running Linux and ntpd.Instead, I got a book with pages devoted to ""The Networking Aspects of the Trojan War"" ... ???"
5,Refreshing!,"This book is a solid one-stop NTP reference for network administrators. In chapters 3 through 5, Rybaczyk covers the NTP topic in a well-rounded manner: from the design-related issues on complex networks that support mission-critical and real-time processes, to NTP configuration and maintenance. When coupled with a succinct and well-researched scan of multiple views of time (Chapter 1), and some dry humor related to the history of network administration (Chapter 2), this publication is a refreshing reading for a net admin pro and layman alike, especially those interested in the subject of time. Chapter 4 includes a nice section on NTP terms and definitions that seem better explained and articulated than in the typical product manuals."
5,Abstract Fun,"Normally I would not pursue reading a book in this particular field but the author, Peter Rybaczyk, immediately caught my interest in the beginning chapters with his prose-like examination of the multi-dimentional aspects of time--historical, scientific, literary and philosophical. These very abstract ideas are presented through the eyes of a character called Sam. They are thought-provoking and well written and provide a creative foundation for his writing on NTP."
2,Very small,"This is a small shaker, and I find that the chilling wand takes up too much space in the cup."
3,Fit & Fresh Chilled Shaker Review,"Pro: This concept is ideal, I have been looking for something like this for years.. Storage for the powder and a way to keep the drink cold...Con: Way to small for any protein shake that I would make..I did buy one and after seeing the actual size, gave it away..Make It Bigger Please!!!!!"
3,Handy but...,"Does not keep the liquid chilled as long as it claims it to be, only lasts about an hour. But at the same time that is it with it being left out in my car in 80 degree weather but in a closed compartment. Overall it was worth the purchase if your on the go."
3,"Could be better, but close",Pros: Convenience of having a cup underneath for later mixing drinksat the gym or other. Doesn't appear to have a rubber seal whichother shakers have; which over time can wear and if not seatedproperly can be damaged or stretched.Cons: Size could be about six to eight ounces bigger. Doesn't appear tohave a tight seal. Are you supposed to screw the cap on a certainway? Snap it on? Other?
5,Chauffe Marcel!,"This swingin' album is sure to please fans of hot club jazz and French accordion music. In fact, I would say that Marcel Loeffler's sound is a cross between Django Reinhardt and Gus Viseur. The instrumentation is standard for a gypsy jazz album, yet features some very interesting guests and duets, including Bireli Lagrene and Marcel Azzola. The tunes are mostly originals and Django covers, plus a few other gems. Check out Amazon's French site (www.amazon.fr) for the sound samples."
4,Britain's Last Ditch Plan...,"Britain's Last Ditch Plan...Peter Fleming's work ""Operation Sea Lion"" is an account of German preparation and the British counter-measures for the invasion of England in 1940. The author was appointed to organize guerrilla units in various parts of the country to wage a guerrilla war on the German occupiers as a last ditch effort. The actual and planned activities of these units are explained in detail providing an interesting perspective on setting up undergrounds, auxiliary and guerrilla units."
2,No New Information!,This book is a complete waste of money. It is basically a printout of the Platform SDK and MSDN documentation.
2,Not for northern Colorado!,"I was planning on going camping in Colorado with my Jeep. I wanted to find some trails and such in which I could take my Jeep off roading. This book had good reviews so I figured what the heck. The book is very well written and put together. It has very good pictures of the trails and even lists them from easy to moderate to hard trails. The only problem is that the book only has the trails for southern and central Colorado! I was planning on going to Estes Park only to find out this book does not have any trails in northern Colorado. When I opened the book and looked at the map it stated that if I wanted the trails in northern Colorado I would have to purchase the ""Guide to Northern Colorado Backroads"". One would assume that purchasing a book stating guide to Colorado trails, one would assume that it would refer to all of Colorado but apparently not."
5,Knowing the Big Cats by Name,"I cannot speak highly enough of about the wonderful Big Cat series (known in the U.S. as Big Cat Diary). There is none of the alienating distance most nature shows present. You get to know the cats, their cubs, and the hosts. It makes all the difference. I recommend this series to those who love nature shows and big cats, of course, but even more to those who are bored by the typical National Geographic stuff."
5,Excellent!,"I love this documentary about the ""big cats."" Very well done. You will experience the thrill of the wild from the comfort of your couch by engaging with the people and the animals, especially the lions who are the stars of the film. The male lions are magnificent. They add extraordinary beauty to the wild nature. The lionesses are also very beautiful on the magnificent African plains (where most people will never go). Understanding animal behavior, why they do what they do, and all the ramifications of their behavior in the wild opens the mind to new vistas of perception, with superior intellectual perspicuity, and broader horizons of appreciation for such magnificent creatures. This video series will help you go and experience nature in all its glory and wildness."
2,Buy from a different seller. This one is full of it.,"This seller is saying that $19.95 is 43% off retail when retail is $19.95. This seller has some bogus product name, not the real product name, and not many details. No wonder people give this person 3 stars. He doesn't deserve that. Find a real seller of this pouch.Then one of the ""reviewers"" says the snap was on wrong? Puh-leeze. Maybe this seller is buying these from some chinese knock off shop?I have bought 9 or 10 of these pouches over the last 20 years (with the steel) to go with the Victorinox Ranger knife (who was the reviewer that said this pouch only fit one Victorinox knife? Maybe they bought the wrong size).Love the Victorinox Ranger. And a **genuine** Dermatt XL pouch with the steel is very cool, very sturdy and I love mine. So have all those who have gotten one. That's why I have bought so many more to give to others. And I am getting ready to buy 3 more, but not from this seller."
4,Very good Sheath.,"Victorinox - X-Large Zermatt Pouch, Leather, Black w/SteelI have had these sheaths before and found them to be excellent quality, with a long life. Replacement has been caused by loss or purchase of new knife. I appreciate the sharpening steel. I usually dampen the sheath and form it to the knife for a tight fit. I will no doubt be ordering another for another blade I have recently purchased. I have tried other sheaths made of other materials and have been very disappointed with their durability and security. The little extra in cost is cheap as compared to the loss of a blade.Russ"
3,"Nice product, wrong size","This is a very nice knife pouch, but the X-Large size I ordered turned out to be the Large size in a box marked X-Large, confirmed by trying to fit the Victorinox Champ knife in the pouch and finding the pouch too small. There is no model or part # on the pouch itself, nor is the pouch marked with the Victorinox name or emblem. The steel seems to work very well, as I have used it to touch up the blades on some Victorinox and Spyderco knives and it did a fine job."
5,Great Gene Autry picture,"This fine Gene Autry picture is different from other Autry films in that it is set in the Old West. There are no cars or telephones here - Gene communicates by smoke signals!""Indian Territory"" features a wonderful song: Chattanoogie Shoeshine Boy.I am looking forward to the release of two other great Gene Autry films from Columbia: Loaded Pistols (available from Amazon, but not in the restored version) and The Last Roundup. According to William K. Everson, writer of A Pictorial History of the Western Film, these two pictures are among the best B-Westerns made anywhere. I've seen Loaded Pistols and I agree."
5,"Summarizes in Simple, Graphic Fashion what a Building Does","A practical overview of the natural order of architecture. Explains what building do (i.e. Effects of outdoor environment, human environment and the concept of shelter). Explains how a building works (i.e. Various practical functions, providing water, removing wastes, thermal comfort, HVAC, acoustics, form, structural support, fire control, building expansion, etc.).This book sticks to the basics of what a building is all about. This is not a book about design princples and concepts (old or modern); the book stresses the practical nature of building construction/design and the interface with human beings and the environment.Excellent book for students, architecture professors, practicing architects, builders and people just wanting to know more about the principles of architecture."
3,It's dust removal spray.,"It removed dust. By spraying compressed air. It got roughly the same usage as all the other dust removal sprays I have used, with the same results. Just be sure to turn your electronics off before using it, it'll do."
4,A Correction,"Even though the timing of this CD is listed at over 70 minutes, it is in reality just over 50. Not that this would deter any Schipa aficianados. I prefer the opera recordings, but these later recordings sport surprisingly agreeable sound. Check out the early recordings on Nimbus and I believe Romophone also to see what this great lyric tenor was all about. These recordings, some ten or 15 years past prime show how even more than Gigli he was able to preserve his basic sound through a combination of rest and repertoire. This obscure release contains my favorite version of that (too?) much recorded old saw Core n'grato, here raised to a thing sublime."
2,Even the zombies fell asleep,Even the zombies fell asleep - Even the zombies fell asleep - Even the zombies fell asleep-Even the zombies fell asleep
1,Sucks,"I thought this would be a fun movie to watch as I am a huge fan of the zombie genre, I was dead wrong (no pun intended). The acting was very dry and the makeup and blood looked bad too. I only got through about 20 minutes before I could no longer take it. I really wish I could get a refund. Save your money."
2,Bad,"The film is really boring, and the acting is so bad! Do not waste your time or money with this movie!!!"
4,Good reference,"Goes into Kandel's idea of uniting Psychoanalysis and Neuroscience, and presents an interesting list of papers and lecture Kandel has given throughout the last 30 years.Not as pleasurable as his ""A History of Mind"", but definitely a must-read"
4,Its O.K,"There was not much to go on when I ordered it so I took a chance. What I was really looking for was something wide and padded around the neck area. This strap is thin and not padded. It's just over an inch in width and about 24"" long. For the price, its o.k."
3,Lame,"If this is the best book on Director, I'd switch to VB. There are numerous obvious errors in the text, that even an intermediate user could see was wrong. The artwork in the examples is quite poor. The Lingo coverage seems like it was written by someone who doesn't know how to program. Even worse, they seem like they were written for Director 5, and don't take advantage of Director 6 features."
4,Jim Croce CD,Whoops this must be the new CD I mentioned in an earlier review - If you like his music as I do the CD is great.
5,Jim Croce,Brings back memories of days gone by. I enjoy singing along while on the road whether running errands driving to visit family.
2,CROCE is a MASTER-This Cd is not-you can do better,"Jim Croce was a great singer songwriter. This CD just straches the surface- The 2 CD ""Jim Croce 50 Anniversary"" collection is so much more worth the cost of a few extra bucks-you get all of his original works. If you only know some of his song (and like what you hear)-get the Anniversary collection it is well worth the cost and the effort. Enjoy-Jim's Music Lives Forever"
2,Classic songs and slop all on one album,"Jim Croce was a curious figure. While capable of writing observant, witty and memorable songs such as 'Bad, Bad Leroy Brown' and 'You Don't Mess Around With Jim', he could also produce sentimental slop such as 'Operator' or 'Lover's Cross'. Unfortunately, the slop predominates, tuneful though the slop may be. This CD is worth getting just for the handful of genuine classics. The rest require a sick bucket and may give you sugar diabetes if you listen to them more than once."
2,"LOVE Jim Croce, the ""remastering"" sucks!","The remastering makes the recording tinny & lacks depth.Sad thing to do to Jim Croce's music.This was the BEST album made, the music was originally some of the most beautiful, earthy, talented music ever recorded...There may have been some poorly remastered dicks & some not? so you might want to take a chance & see what it sounds like to you. I did NOT get mine here, so cold have been a bad run???The album is fantastic! Jim Croce died WAY too young. He was VERY talented."
5,Great cd,it is a very great cd and my husband listens to it non stop. he was very pleasde with the item and the delivery was very very fast!!!Thank you
5,If I could save time in a bottle,I miss Jim Croce. He was one of the best at telling a story in a song.
4,JP's Recommended Listening,This CD gives a great retrospective of the musical history and amazing song writing skills of Jim Croce. I highly recommend this to any fan that enjoys an artist with the ability to tell a story through the gift of music.
4,Bombs Away!,"Cherry Bomb is an indie action film that is good, but not great. It has enough action and a fast pace, but not enough nudity for a movie with a stripper as the lead character. Adult film star Nick Manning is perhaps the best thing about the movie, delivering a campy performance as the stripper's boss. Also the movie is quite violent. Recommended."
3,CHERRY BOMB,ITS PRETTY MUCH A CRAPPY MOVIE BUT FUN TO WATCH IN ALL ITS FOOLISHNESS! IF YOU LIKE CAMPY 70'S FEEL TYPE MOVIES THIS ONE WOULD COVER IT ..
3,They should not have done that!,"Don't touch the girl, rule number one at the strip club!It gets broken after being a victim to sexual crimes Cherry goes off the deep end and begins a rampage that would make Jon Rambo call the cops. This is not a T & A flick although you may get a glimsp here and there. This is revenege and Cherry is a cold one."
5,Very Nice,Needed a brushed bronze towel ring to match a Kohler Forte faucet since the Forte bronze towel rings had been discontinued. The color was a perfect match and the style was very close. The ring is very solid and well made.
5,Very sturdy,This towel ring is very sturdy and a solid piece. I like it so much better than the towel ring I replaced that had a loose ring that moved whenever you used the towel. It looks great with the other products from the Devonshire collection.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Merlin is trying to work out why Julia went all Femme Fatale on him, and why the J's are out to get him.He starts to discover there is some sort of clandestine struggle between the powers at the heart of Amber and Chaos."
4,"Great value, works well","Compared to the other heart monitors, I feel this was a huge value. My husband asked me how much I paid for it when I first got it because he couldn't believe it was less than $100. Training with a heart monitor has changed my workouts for the better and improves the efficiency of my fitness routine. I bought this for spin class, but now I use it for every workout. I highly recommend it!"
4,Excellent value,"While the slew of menus and features in this HRM may be daunting to those using it for the first time, it soon becomes very simple, and those extra features in the product description become quite handy. My favorite feature is the display of the ""zone"" you're in, calculated from a percentage of your maximum rate. It seems to be quite accurate, and the only real criticism I have is that the backlight requires you to press two buttons at once, potentially going into another menu if you press one button slightly before the other. Also, the light turns off after a short time, even if you are still navigating through the menus."
1,Short useful life,"Used the monitor for six months, worked great. Suddenly ""NO SIGNAL"" appears whenever I try it. Changed batteries, slathered self with conducting gel, still NO SIGNAL. Shouldn't a $50 HRM last longer than six months?"
1,Very bad quality!!! Don't buy.,Sigma watch has a very poor quality. I bought I PC7 one year ago and the first time I put it under the shower it stops working (it was supposed to be 3m water resistance). I sent to sigma and I have to pay for all transport expenses from (From China to Brazil).After 1 year the battery is down and the back is rusty (I have a 10 year old Casio watch that is used in swimming in pool and seawater and does not have any rusty).Don't recommend Sigma watches.
1,Poor quality,"This combination heart rate monitor/watch is not user friendly, comes with a poorly written manual, and is the antithesis of intuitive electronics."
1,sigma PC 15 watch,This was the first product that I purchase off of the internet that I felt is JUNK! I can kick myself for throwing away the box. The chest ban the is use fails over 50% of the time. I e-mailed the mfg. and was told to water down the contacts. That worked for less then fifteen seconds and received a no signal read out on the watch. Do yourself a favor and go to consumer report let this company rate the product first before purchasing. I will sell this watch for $10.00 because that is the only module that works. BYER BE WARE!
4,"Good for the price, could be more sensitive.","All in all, I liked the functionality provided by this heart rate monitor. Unfortunately common bodily flexing can lift the contacts from the skin just enough for it to lose the heart signal, where it starts an incessant and annoying beeping. This will happen despite being covered head to toe in highly conductive sweat, possibly thanks to the design of the sensors.Aside from that minor annoyance, the watch remains easy to use, offers review of your last workout with all the expected averages, maximum sustained levels, and some accumulated values for total workout length and calories burned. Very good price for all the features it offers, and it even comes with a handle-bar mount for all you bikers out there."
4,a GREAT heartrate monitor,"For the money, this one does a great job. It works reliably and is flexible enough to view anything you'd want (current heartrate PLUS ... max HR, avg HR, % of max HR, calories burned, training time, more). If that wasn't enough, you can turn off the HR monitor and use it like a watch. You can even change the name across the bottom to anything you want (like YOUR name). Indigo night light works WELL in dark environments."
4,Pretty decent HRM,"Had this for about 3 weeks and used it quite number of times. Programming is straightforward once you get the hang of the menu functions. I don't use any gel or water to get it going, but I notice that the HRM only responds when I start moving around, then the measurement is rock steady - note I don't think the stopwatch will start until the heart rate is monitoring. It works perfectly during exercise and never misses a beat (sorry about the pun). The watch works well enough and looks solid, although I wouldn't choose to wear it as a fashion item. Functionality is pretty good with a timer, max and average heart rate and a bonus of calories burned; I guess based on age, weight as well as heart rate."
4,Works for me,Bought this monitor on recommendation for indoor rower use. It has worked well. Not really intuitive but I've figured it out. Great price.
3,not bad.. could be better,"It works well overall, but my main complaint is that it looses signal too often. Also, the dial is difficult to read in dim light. The manual is difficult to read and follow. Some info doesn't seem to be in there.. what are the beeps for??? It does work well when it has a good signal but as mentioned, it looses it for no apparent reason. The range isn't that good either. I only seem to be able to get about 8 feet from the sensor .."
5,Awesome Game For All Ages!,"Tarzan is one of the best games I've ever played! I first bought this game when I was 7 years old. I am 16 now, and a hardcore gamer, but I still love playing this game! The graphics are top notch and the gameplay is fun and addictive. There are tons of cool moves to use as well as 3 difficulty levels to challenge your skill level with.Whether you're a hardcore gamer or brand new to video games, this is a great game to get!"
1,I wish I could give it zero stars,Reality- This game is straight right..I thought I was back on my dusty Sega.. If you're over the age of six..don't even bother with the load time on this one. ACK
5,AWESOME!!!!,"This game is FANTASTIC!!!! Bought it for my four-year old son and he loves it. I love it! It's fun and challenging. My son loves throwing fruit at the baboons and other creatures and he loves swinging from the vines. FUN, FUN, FUN. Highly recommend for the whole family."
1,Not Very Helpful,"Not only does this book only go over the very very basic steps on how to use this program, which I could have figured out how to use to program by doing this without the book, but is out-dated. I think it was a good idea to have color and show lots of pictures of screens that the author is talking about, but half the screens have already been changed in the new updated version of this program. There are options the book talks about that are no longer offered in the program or are gotten to by different steps."
4,Very easy read,"I got the book for information on how to manage in a world where jobs are disappearing. While the author discusses the job landscape that was taking form almost 20 years ago, the discussion is still valid today. Most importantly, the author describes how people can best manage the transition period between losing a job and finding another which is as relevant today as it ever was."
5,An authoritative sourcebook on Conservative Judaism,"This is an authoritative and open sourcebook on the origins and philosophy of Conservative Judaism, also known as Positive-Historical Judaism and Masorti Judaism.Professor Rabbi Dorff covers the development of Judaism from the time of the Torah all the to the enlightenment. He discusses the theology and philosophy of the Jewish movements that developed in response to the modern age: Conservative, Reform, Orthodox and Reconstructionist Judaism.This book explains Conservative Judaism's philosophy on tradition and change within halakha (Jewish law), social issues and more."
5,Cute little book with a ton of great pics,I bought this book for my daughter who loves animals. She was not disappointed. This cute hand sized but large (700+ pages) book is chock full of wonderful pictures of all kinds of baby animals. It's a great gift for an animal lover.
2,Fragile and TINY,"Ok so bad me for not appreciating this book is only about 1.5 inches square... very small! Cute, but tough to handle. More importantly, my toddler ripped the cover off on day two - and she is generally gentle with books. Cute but very tiny and fragile. It's also hard to know what captions go with what, so challenging to associate the text with the appropriate animal."
4,I still vividly remember this book...,"...although I last read it over 20 years ago! There is pure MAGIC in the story. When I first saw TOY STORY, this book came to mind right away. Just great descriptive writing of a make-believe world that almost seems real, set with those lovely illustrations that help tell the story beautifully! In fact, I'm getting this for my 8 year old niece - a perfect book for a doll lover her age! Yet, also, a story that is SO good, I can still remember it well...Just get this book, your daughter will love it!"
2,The Doll's House disappointed,"This book was purchased for grandchildren. I read the books I give them to screen objectionable material. I love older children's books, but this was difficult to read. It went into my yard sale."
3,Maybe I'm too old,"I'll have to ask my grandchildren what they think of this book. I didn't find it very interesting. The characters stuck me as a bit ""wooden"". (Ha)"
5,I had no Idea!,"I bought a box of these elsewhere on an impulse. Now, I find that they are actually cheaper than Basics type regular paper towels, as they are reusable. I have used them with various hydrocarbon solvents and they hold up very well. I also found them great for rubbed finishes, such as wood stains."
3,Better than Bounty,"My dad used to get me industrial cloths from a guy that works with the DOT but ever since he stopped working I wasn't able to get anymore. I found these because I wanted cloths I would be able to use for multitasking but they're not all that. They can do a good job but I was looking for something more stronger. Now I'm just using them as a replacement for swifter refills. Pour some Mr. Clean on the floor, wipe it up with the swifter and I'm good to go."
5,A Hit in Any Language,"(published in Carefree Enterprise 11/2000)(author: Betty Mermelstein)""Two cultures combined in creativity, bringing together the best of their writing talents and love of storytelling.""""The characters have distinctive voices, and through their adventures in nature, they learn valuable lessons that are passed on to the reader."""
4,"great book, maybe coud be shorter","This is a great book filled with bunch of great tips for leaders. Personally I greatly appreciated the idea of covenant, and the questions to ask people. I took one star off just b/c I felt like the book could have been a bit shorter. Bunch of things were repeated again and again and at some parts some water was just added to the text. But overall, great book!"
5,Praise to the mighty Commodity,"Should I dare say this is the freshest music to hit my CD player in ages? Yes. In a world where most bands inspire to likes of Fred Durst or Dave Matthews, it's nice to find a band out there blending more admirable influences (such as Fugazi, Firehose, Primus, Oingo Boingo?) with a dash of Bay Area garage-rock sensibility. The result is something really original and fun to listen to. Check out Victim of the System, I almost [soiled] my pants!"
3,Unrelieved dreariness,Unrelieved dreariness and misery. I kept on reading hoping the story would pick up and there would be at least one bright spot or two but there was none. There was no pleasure in reading this book.
2,eh...,"I knew it would be cutesy, and plenty of really good books play with that format...this isn't one. It somehow makes you feel worse, and it's very heavy handed.Much too Christian."
4,Get it in the right spot,"This is a great gadget and I feel that the results are pretty accurate. I have found that you really need to position this in just the right spot on your wrist, though, as it seems like an inch higher or lower makes a big difference. I've found that placing the lower edge about where the lower edge of my watch normally sits seems to have the most accurate readings (about 1.5"" from my palm)."
2,Not Very Accurate - I Tried 3 of Them,"I loved the idea of a wrist blood pressure monitor, so I was happy to get this one. At first, I thought my blood pressure was lower - then I tested a couple family members and then tested it against other monitors. It was always low, so I returned it for another one. Same thing, so the manager at Rite Aid let me try one more - it was also 20 - 25 points low every time.I am pretty disappointed as it was quick, comfortable and easy to use. If accuracy is important, you might want to test this against some other blood pressure monitors, though. Maybe I got 3 faulty units in a row, but that doesn't seem very likely."
5,Good transaction,Good seller. Fast delivery. Item is as described. Thank you for your business!!!!! Pleasant to do business with. Recommended. A++++++
3,BPM,I am a little disapointed as the BPM readings are far different from the doctors monitor. I purchased one as I have been suffering from high blood pressure. As I live a considerable way from the doctors I wanted to keep a check myself. I checked my BP at home before going to the doctors and then had it taken at the doctors but the difference was considerable. So I can only assume that the one I purchased doesn't give a good reading.Patti
3,Omron BP Monitor,"The monitor works as designed, however, it consistantly reads my BP about 6 to 10 points lower than the larger Omron model with the arm cuff. Tried to contact Omron via email and was unsucessful. I was instructed to call, which does not work for me. Therefore I adjusted my thinking regarding the readings I'm receiving."
2,Unreliable readingsr readings,This blood pressure monitor gives too many false high and low readings when you compare it with a manual device.It can misguide the persons using it.
1,Defect...Cuff Pump...Poor Warranty...Cheap Company...,"I bought this unit about 3 weeks ago and within one week the cuff pump doesn't pump up as it should. I checked with the seller (bought it online), she said that she has the same experience once.I called Omron and they said that I can send it in for repair along with $5.00 for return postage. I told them that this is a defective unit (manufacturer's defect), they should not charge customer for return postage.I feel that Omron who shipped the defective product should have the courtesy to paid for their own postage. The fault is with them and not consumers, thus we should NOT have to paid for their mistakes.This is the first and last for me, I do not recommend buying any unit from Omron. There are many other choices, make sure that you do your research and watchout on those rules regarding warranty information.Good luck.Unhappy consumer"
4,Very Pleased,"Ordered this for my dad as it was easier for him to use (by himself) than an arm cuff. It, so far, has worked out well and the ease of using it means he will monitor his BP on a regular basis.Medical professionals have told me that it is, sometimes, not as accurate as a cuff. But, if BP is not at a risky level, this is acceptable. One point, with a wrist monitor, it is necessary to 1) be at rest for 5 min and 2) the wrist must be held up at angle to heart for most accurate reading, not simply laying flat on arm of chair or in lap.I have recommended these to others with aging parents."
4,Does the job,"Not much else to say. It does what it is supposed to and does it well. Easy to use, and seems to be accurate."
1,Does not register either arm even w new batteries,"I am a nurse and have used the Omron HEM-629 wrist monitor this for for past year to monitor my blood pressure. There are many times I receive the message ""E"" on both wrists and the machine will not give me a read out even with new batteries.....There does not seem to be a fix for this......I was hoping to continue to use this machine but have decided to give up on it....."
2,this model is very loose and the third day I used it was not properly working any more.,This model was very bad the first day work properly but the third day it kept saying error. I bough another blood pressure monitor from target it was more expensive about $15 more but it has work perfectly. The product from amazon are a 50/50 chance. not a very good idea to buy this type of products from this seller.
5,Accurate alternative to the sometimes difficult arm cuffs,"This wrist cuff is so easy to use, you can check your blood pressure more frequently. It seems to be as accurate as the arm cuffs. Well worth the investment!"
5,great convenience and price,"We purchase these units to be used in our dental practice. California state law now requires that we take blood pressure reading prior to use of any administered anesthetic. Since we cannot ask patients to remove clothing and put on a medical gown as is done at a doctors appointment, these work great when patients have too much restrictive clothing on. We have one in each operatory. Periodically we check the readings against the traditional cuff and stethoscope method on ourselves and the readings are consistently correct. A number of our patients have told us they use one at home for daily checks. Next best thing to a cuff, and Amazon has the best price we have found."
1,Beware,I have not had this very long and it is already malfunctioning and I can not find a solution in the manual. I hope I can figure out how to return/service it. Also reading in dr's i office not even close to a reading taken with it shortly before.
4,Not exactly accurate,"I like the convenience of the wrist blood pressure monitor, but it reads low. I don't know how to adjust it, I don't think it can be adjusted, so I just remember that the reading is going to be low. It gives me a psychological boost to see my bp so low!"
4,Omron Hem 629,"This is overall a great product. I am an EMT-B and i use it every day. It is nice to have the hard case with it beacause it keeps it from getting damaged while bouncing around in the back of the ambulance. I have gotten inaccurate reading from this bp cuff on a few patients, but that's not bad considering the volume of patients it has been used on without a problem."

5,Niagara Falls -- Volume II,"Niagara Falls, New York is an exceptional place - not only blessed with one of the seven wonders of the natural world, but also with a rich and very colorful history dating back to the 1500s when the French explorers first arrived and much, much further where the Native American tribes are concerned. Daniel M. Dumych has brilliantly captured the late Victorian Era when the Falls were exploited for their money-making potential and raw power. He reverently shows how the first power project (Schoellkopf Station) was built and eventually destroyed by the collapse of the wall of the Niagara Gorge; the bustle and entertainment of Falls Street during the first half of the 20th Century; the awe as the current Niagara Power Project was constructed. This is a thoroughly enjoyable book for anyone who has grown up in Niagara Falls as I have, or for anyone who has ever visited the majesty of the cataract. Or for anyone who just loves history."
5,My favorite Tarzan book,"This second book in the Tarzan series was always my favorite of the lot, followed by ""Tarzan and the Foreign Legion."" As another reviewer points out, it has a strong ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" vibe, although it predates that film by almost seven decades seeing as how it was first published in a pulp mag in 1913. The book edition came out two years later.Like ""Raiders,"" the story plays out seriously, but has a decidely cartooney air because so much adventure and coincidence are packed into the story. It's a fantasy adventure but it's just so thrilling, packed with jungle adventure, desert adventure, spies, cruise ships, lost cities, half-human races, treasure, Paris, love-to-hate villains and gorgeous women.I recommend ""The Return of Tarzan"" above the first novel mainly because everyone knows the basic origin tale and so it's kind of stale. ""The Return of Tarzan"" is the best place to start with the series. It's equal parts thrilling, captivating and just plain fun!"
5,Tarzan takes Paris!,"That's not the whole story of course but it's an impressive part of it. Tarz renounces his family name,fortune and the woman he loves, giving it all to his cousin, and he does it all in Wisconsin! Yup, Wisconsin. Hurting from the ordeal, he heads off to Paris to forget about Jane. Wow, the Apeman in the City of Lights! So he spends time in Paris, almost has an affair with a Russian noblewoman, whups on her brother(an evil Russian spy), hangs out in art galleries and operas and eventually joins the French Secret Service out of boredom. All this is just the set-up for the rest of the novel. The book does seem to end too quickly but I think that has more to do with the serial/pulp nature of the story's publication deadline than any fault of the author. Tarzan and The Return of... are an entertaining 0ne-Two punch. Anyone who reads #1 should finish the experience by reading #2. I wish someone would make a film of this book, it's more interesting than the first one."
5,Book 1 is unfair without 2,"I had started out saying ""I'll just read one for a laugh,"" after going to the library with a friend on my way home from seeing Disney's new cartoon. My mom told me start with the first one but I could NOT stop there. I didn't think it was fair! Book #2 doesn't give everyone a happy ending but doesn't leave you complaining for the next month. After #1 leaves you with Jane engaged to Tarzan's cousin who now has his title, woman, and inheritance. This may sound odd but Tarzan also joins the French Secret Service! I may still laugh at the movies but I will never again laugh at the ""real"" Tarzan of the books! I don't think of Disney's show as Tarzan. It was fun, but it wasn't Tarzan."
3,Return of Tarzan,"It pretty much picked up the story from Tarzan of the Apes, which I enjoyed. My grandson really liked it too."
4,Return of tarzan,"its a good easy read, it reminds me of when i was a kid and watched Tarzan movies every Sunday afternoon. And the price is right for me, free!"
5,Never enough,"No matter how many ERB Tarzan books I read or how many times I read them, its never going to be enough. Love the characters, love the over the top plot and when I get to the end I start looking for the next one. What ever will I do when I finally get to the end of the series. Let's see...I KNOW...I'll start all over again."
4,Super Reader,"Tarzan decides it is best if he leaves Jane, and returns to Africa. He falls in with a couple of dodgy noble types, and ends up having some Arab adventures, joins the Waziri tribe, and eventually ends up reunited with Jane in Opar.The only problem he has is that one of the powerful women of Opar wants his body, and is not too happy Jane has prior claims.Revelation of his position, marriage and return eventuate."
4,Magnifique!,"This was the second Tarzan novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. It picks up right where thefirst Tarzan bookleft off. Jane is engaged to Tarzan's cousin and Tarzan is sailing back to Europe. Will Tarzan and Jane end up together? Of course, but there will be many obstacles before they get there. This is a solid adventure novel, which fans of old time pulp fiction will enjoy."
3,"A Must-Read completion to ""Tarzan of the Apes""","While I wasn't completely crazy about the novel, I did think it necessary to read after reading the original ""Tarzan"". Those who have seen the Disney film will realize that this is a different character. I like Burrough's Tarzan, but the novel lacked what the original provided. ""Return"" had too much travel and seemed to end too quickly. I wish Burrough's had simply followed a plot more clearly linking Tarzan to Jane. Still, this was a necessary and enjoyable read."
4,Wow,Why couldn't the movies be this great? I could sit down and read the full story again. As well as the rest of them.
5,Tarzan gets justice,"In Edgar Rice Burroughs second book of the Tarzan series we see the ever more increasingly human Tarzan,enter into the political and social issues of the early 20th century. Tarzan now learns about trickery and deceit; and how a grudge made can lead to an end of his own life. He has too make choices that many of us would have great difficulty selecting the right course of action, as he honorably gives up the woman he loves out of respect for ones personal commitment. Tarzan raised by wild apes, is more human than most people who claim the title today."
5,Awesome,This book is awesome. I love the series and plan on reading all the books in relation. Blah blah blah
2,"Too plain to be ""advanced""","This is probably one of the poorer books in my O'Reilly collection. While all the other books I own from them seem to cover all basis of a particular topic, from concept to implementation to futher reading, this book provides only a brieft introduction with small and impratical examples, often filled with errors. It seems like the author simply saw a market for this book and wrote it fast fast as possible. If you have no clue as to some of the advanced features available for PERL, this one is for you. If you want truely useful references, try the perl website."
2,no longer useful,"This book is a waste of a good title, and I wish it would either go out of print, or be completely rewritten (in fact, there have been rumors that the latter will happen!). It was a passable early book on Perl, and it isn't so bad in and of itself, but it's useless to anyone nowadays, as the really interesting material that it tries to cover is much better addressed in Conway's excellent /Object Oriented Perl/.(To be fair, chapter 20 of /Advanced Perl Programming/ is a good overview of the internals of the Perl interpreter-compiler. However, that's of real interest to very few people.)Instead of spending their time and money on this book, learners are better off reading the other, more recent good books on Perl, and flipping thru modules in CPAN."
4,Covers topics that other books don't,"This book was perfect for me because it covered all of the perl topics that I wanted to learn some time, but didn't have a handy way to do so. Object-oriented programming, GUI's, extending perl, and exception handling are just some of the topics covered. The emphasis of the explanations in the book are geared toward helping the reader write useful programs."
3,This is an okay book.,"For having ""Advanced"" in the title, it sure could be a let down. If you have Learning Perl, Programming Perl and the Perl Cookbook, you can only get a little bit of knowledge from this book. Not horrible, but not really needed to expand your knowledge."
4,nice breadth of topics,"The book does a nice job of explaining some of the obscure areas of Perl. Each chapter is summarized by showcasing the strengths and weaknesses of Perl with Java,Python,C++,TCL. This is a good refresher book for intermediate level Perl programmers. It was definitely a fun read. I think O'Reilly is readying a second edition."
3,No Chapter on Processes or IPC,"Since receiving this book as a gift in June I have rarely consulted it, whereas I consult the O'Reilly Camel and Lhama books and the O'Reilly Perl Cookbook all the time. Today I consulted it hoping that it would help me to understand Perl processes (fork, exec, etc.) and to my surprise this Advanced Programming book did not have a chapter on processes! Camel does.It has some stuff on Network programming that relates to threads, but nothing on a topic that I consider to be essential to moving past the baby Perl stage, namely how to start up processes, pipe to them, etc.So I would say that this book probably won't add much to your Perl library."
3,Marine CD & am/rm with remote.,"I can,t get the remote to work and I don,t Know if I ever will because no Tech 800# available. Plus I was suppose to get 2 Speakers and they haven't Arrived."
4,Tin Machine is an excelent band,"Not as good as some of what Bowie has done but much better than that dribble from the 80's prior to this. It's grunge before grunge was a type of music, it's punk it's metal it's blues. Above all it's damn fun to listen to."
3,Tin Machine II...Tin Machine Lite,"Not as raw as the first Tin Machine effort, and certainly more slick. Still, there are some good moments on Bowie's ""return to the garage"" LP. Their rendition of Bryan Ferry's ""If there is something"" is riveting. ""Amlapura"" and ""Betty Wrong"" are elaborately arranged. Hunt Sales vocals on the ultra-blues tune ""Stateside"" are excellent. If you liked TMI, you should own this worthy follow-up album."
3,CACOPHONIC ROCK,"You Belong In Rock 'n Roll has some passion and a quirky inflection here and there, while Baby Universal, One Shot and Amlapura remain memorable. What you get is a loud onslaught of guitar, bass and drums, a cacophony which does not gel well with his voice. Consider this the conclusion of an experiment. Not recommended for those who love Bowie's melodic, pop side. Then again, if you like The Man Who Sold The World, you could possibly get into this."
2,DON'T JUMP AT THIS ONE WITHOUT THINKING FIRST:,"I must tell you, the sound quality on this is horrible, so unless you're left with no LP or Cassette of their first album recordings, such as ""Fall in Love Again"", I would skip this because it's no improvement is sound (or can it even be worse). This band is currently redoing it's early catalog, and maybe they'll re-release their 1st album as well. I would wait. For the price, I'd stick with your squeaky cassette."
3,Honest review !,"BOTTOM LINE:I LOVE the Justus league and Khrysis' beats are monster! But Sean Boogs rhymes are so amateurish they sound silly. And his voice gets drowned out by the beats.With that said, The Away Team comes off sounding like a hot producer with his kid brother tryin to get some shine. And its never good when the guests outdo the host.This would be a killer instrumental CD."
5,New and innovating gospel sound,"This CD is very inspiring both to those in the faith and not, it's a break from the normal sound of gospel music. This is a great quality sounding CD, it's soothing, spiritual, and thought provoking. The captivating emblems, and images are well done, each song in it's own way has it's own message. This is a must to have in your collection, a must to listen to, and have it minister to your soul. I highly recommend this to all in need of a spiritual uplifting and a desire to extend your worship to God."
5,nice,"not only is she an awesome performer. i've met her a couple of times. she is a sweetie, a real down-to-earth sister."
5,Why No Promotion and Airplay?,"It is a sin and a shame that Deborah Bond is a unknown in the music industry. She has it all--lyrics, music and a great band. There is not a bad cut on this cd. This is the type of cd you put on when you have a group of friends over or when you have your signaficant other over. Somebody please get this lady some promotion!!!"
3,Nice bike but brakes are an issue,"This bike is really nice. It looks sharp, is built great for the price point, and is the only thing I found under $300 that was the right size in between the avg 24"" kids bike and a small framed adult bike.We bought this bike for our 7 yr old daughter. She is avg size and strength and could not use the hand brakes at all. We had to spend another $80 to modify the bike so it was safe for her to ride. After several prof opinions we ended up replacing the twist gear shifters with thumb leaver shifters plus added another set of small hand brakes under the handlebar at each side of the stem. We could not safely fit a second set of brakes on the bar without switching the shifters out.If GMC could just add another set of hand brakes this bike would be perfect!"
5,Love this Bike!,"This bike was my birthday present from my husband. I researched for months and talked with a friend that is an avid biker before deciding on this bike. I love my bike, it is the perfect style and color. I am 5'5 and the bike suits me well. The pink and black colors are awesome (especially since I found a matching helmet). Assembly was pretty simple for me to do, my biker friend tweaked it a bit for me. I am able to shift the gears with no problems and the brakes are good. This is a wonderful bike and I would recommend it to others. The shipping did not take long either (I used regular shipping)."
1,Delivered with a cracked frame--,"The bike came with a cracked frame, but Amazon did give a quick refund. So low rating is due to delivery condition."
4,This book sets on my desk,"Im just a home user of Windows 2000 Pro. I switched to Win2K because everyone said it was far more stable than other Windows operating systems. After using the other operationg systems Win2k had a somewhat familiar look and feel, but I needed some reference. I rapidly grew tired of trying to find answers on the internet.Then I bought this book. It has been a great reference for me. I easily found what I was looking for in it. I learned a few things I wasnt looking for.My advice, if your like me just a home user this book will serve you well. It now sets on my desk within easy reach."
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"The little red ribbon graphic on the cover of the book says, ""Mastering the Corporate PC"". Since Windows 2000 is targeted at business users (Microsoft's offering targeted to home users at the time was Windows ME), I had expected more of an emphasis on the likely concerns of business users (i.e. networking, security, etc.) rather than how to use programs like Paint, Wordpad and Media Player. After purchasing the book, I discovered that most of the same information was available, organized in much the same way, on the TechNet section of Microsoft's web site. If Windows 2000 is your first exposure to any form of the Windows operating system, this would probably be an appropriate selection. If you have experience with Windows and are upgrading, I suggest you look for another book."
1,A Most Disappointing Book,"The title of this book would lead you to believe (or at least it led me to believe) that it is a supplement to other books on Windows 2000 and that it would provide guidance on the use of the unique features of the Professional Edition. On the contrary, it is a plain vanilla manual on the use of the general features of Windows designed apparently for the novice who needs to be told how to open a file. If this is what you are looking for, fine. But if you want to learn how to use the real power of Windows 2000 Professional, you need to look further."
4,Nice Microwave,"I've had this GE microwave for several years now and am satisfied with its functionality and compact size. It has several feature buttons (reheat, defrost, popcorn, beverage, etc.) that are very handy, and a nice independent timer that will shut off after the first time it sounds. My only complaint is that over time the interior finish on the door has started to wear off and rust, something I haven't noticed with other microwaves I've used.Update: I purchased a new one of these in January 2008. The controls are a bit simpler to use and the door finish seems to have been improved so that the rust problem may be eliminated."
3,works well but...,The microwave works well...but I've taken two back so far because the door opener sticks and the replacement microwave is starting to do the same thing. I usually have something in my hand and try to open the door with the other hand and and I can't because it's stuck. Very irritating
2,Short-Lived,"When it worked, it was great: easy to use, and easy to clean.The problem is that the power started cutting out, less than six months after purchase. The problem appeared to be with the power cord itself. I kept my receipt, filled out the warranty card, etc, thinking that if I had a problem, GE would honor the one-year warranty, which is suppose to replace any part which is defective...no such luck.First of all, you are expected to take it to a GE servicer, and pick it up later, or else you have to pay a fee to have it serviced in your home. Then I was given the run-around because they tried to say the cord was damaged after it was delivered to the store that sold it, but the store said it was GE's responsibility.Basically, don't buy this microwave if you expect GE to honor the warranty. I ended up buying another brand from a different store to avoid this scenario again.I recommend theEmerson .9 cu. ft. 900-Watt Microwave -."
3,"Works, but with issues","Unit works, but the problem it doesn't rotate any more. If I take it apart and force the tray down it will rotate for about 30 seconds, then freeze again.Not sure I would recommend this to anyone =("
1,Poor Quality,I don't recommend this microwave. Think it only lasted about a year. A little over...spend a little more and get something that will last longer. Evidently the parts on this were not made to last long. One day it just started being really noisy and no cooking think that says the magnetron (microwave producing element) was dead. I am glad i did not review after purchase coz now can let folks know it is not made to last...I will get another brand this time around!
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I bought these last spring for trapping and they lasted the one week I trapped muskrats with just a small leak, I thought i just went over the top of them a little bit. Then I took them out for smallmouths a few weeks later and I found the leak. Then this fall trapping muskrats and raccoon this fall they just completely fell apart the soles started falling off, they had big rips near the calf, and the part that attaches to your belt broke, and the next day the other one fell off! So I had to spend the rest of the week in leaky falling down pieces of crap! I would never recommend this to anyone! It is just a horrible product. I would not even buy another Hodgman product. I was so dissatisfied with this do not buy it."
1,Waste of money,"These waders only lasted three outings. They were always rinsed off after use, hung to dry, then stored properly, stuffed with newspaper. By the beginning of the fourth outing, the left boot had cracked, where the foot flexes at the toes. By the end of the trip, the right one had cracked in the same spot. They aren't worth the money, or the soaked feet."
4,San Francisco garden flag,"I read the reviews before I bought it, several said it was small but it is a garden flag, they are small. It was shipped very quickly, love that! The only thing that I didn't like was that it wasn't printed on both sides. I also knew that from the reviews. It was a very resonable price, so I feel that I got what I paid for. I wasn't surprised by anything when I got it, I was happy with the product for the price."
3,Size does matter!,"Be aware that this product is NOT the standard sized garden flag, it is much smaller. The description lists the dimensions, but I was surprised at how small it was in person. The word ""economy"" describes the flag to a tee."
3,Progressing or going nowhere?,"In general I thought this was a good album, but they failed to progress or experiment. Each track sounded like they found one good loop to work with, but they were afraid to stray from that one particular clip. I just think with the talent they seem to possess they could have gotten a little more creative and made it a bit crazier. Anyways this seems like it would be a better listen if you were on some good psychadelics."
4,Rewarding Effort,"The Orb, at first listen, don't sound like music at all. I heard them first when I was eight and was so disgusted that I vowed never to listen again. It was last year, when I first heard them again, and I was pleasantly surprised. There is a difference between active and passive listening. If you try to hear everything that happens in this cd, then you will get bored out of your mind. If you sit back, relax, close your eyes, and let the music merely flow over you, then you will be a fan forever. ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" is one of the best dance tunes of all time, and the most accessible piece of music the Orb has ever made. ""A Huge Ever-growing Pulsating Brain that Rules from the Center of the Ultraworld"" is a rewarding, eighteen minute climax to the album. A wonderful, groundbreaking LP. If you should ever want to make a collection of electronica's greatest albums, this would be a must."
4,A starter for any potential Orb fan!,"I remember the first time I heard an Orb song. It was during one of my weekened/midnight excursions around Dallas and they played ""Fluffy Little Clouds"" I got the weirdest sensation when I first listend to this song. Felt like someone was lightly running the tip of a very cold knife up and down my spine. I LIKED IT! So I ran out and grabbed this particular album. Some of the songs grabs you immediately. Others take time to grow on you.Having said that if you get any of their other albums, don't expect the same. Expect DIFFERENT....very different styles and samplings.I give it 4 in stead of 5, because I'm hoping for a better album when it comes out."
5,Stratospheric Adventure,This album was created ahead of its time. A package of crisp bass and funky melody. These songs will leave an imprint in your ears that will change the way you absorb sound. Trust me if you are browsing in this section of Amazon take a trip down this sonic river.
1,This is an edited version of the original album,"This is the U.S. release of the album. It does not contain all the tracks listed in the description, and some of the tracks have been edited down. Buy the import version if you want the original album."
3,Overrated....,Can't remember where I read reviews (perhaps here on Amazon..)but I was sucked in by them and fully expected more than what I heardupon first run through. Haven't honestly given it a full listen again...I've started it but found myself getting bored very quickly and takenit off with no interest in revisiting it. I'm guessing I'll end up taking itsomewhere to sell it as Used....
3,A Starting Figure...,"Having been recently introduced to the music we all listen to, and recieving the CD as a gift from an OE, I found that the first track ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" was right on track to what I was looking for - however the remainder of the disc, and album however proved a little disappointing. I shan't part with it, but keep it as a reminder of the stepping stone to where I am now. Dust gatherer, nice gift tho'"
5,It's real good.,"Some people say this is boring, liek half my friends, but remember it was produced from 1989 to 1991 so it's nto gonna be too advanced. But it was very important in the evolution of techno. You can't to all the tracks if dancey stuff is what you wanted but alot of it is dancy like Little, and Perpetual, and the ambient tracks are nice to do your homework to. So get it now while its still around."
2,Your 10-year-old brother with a trance track,"Once again I've been suckered by glowing reviews into purchasing an album that could have been made by an auto plant robot. It's basically the opening track of ""Dark Side of the Moon"" overlaid with old newscast voices and your little brother blowing bubbles through his straw. The best I can say for this is that it's not as obnoxious as Lesiem's ""Mystic Spirit Voices."" I'm sticking with Steve Roach."
1,Are we going in circles dear?,"I managed to listen to one song from this CD---Little Puffy Clouds. Reminded me a lot of a song or two from the album ""Mix Up"" by Patrick O'Hearn.Or maybe I should have (time traveled and) listened to this CD first; then I'd be saying the same thing about Patrick O'Hearn's CD.Original sounding music [yawning] is soooooooooo hard to find. Especially ""original"" trance-type music. It's, come to think of it, an oxymoron: original trance."

2,a a qd mme vieilli!,"Je suis un peu déu par cet album... c'est morne, le son est pas top... a trane dans les longueurs... bref ennuyeux! mais bon il faut se mettre à l'époque aussi! a à qd mme 13 ans!"
5,"A ""Trip"" Through the Universe","The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Underworld may officially be called techno, but it's hardly dance music. This is techno as filtered through a 70's haze of Pink Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Pothead pixies Gong are another influence, and former Gongster Steve Hillage turns up here as co-writer and producer on a few tracks.Your pilot, Dr Alex Paterson, takes control of the spacecraft and guides you to other worlds with a swirling sound collage of beats, samples, music and voices. Your tour of the Underworld and beyond takes place over 10 long tracks on 2 CD's. This is very trippy stuff, like the bands named above with a modern-production cinematic quality.Favorite tracks are ""Earth (Gaia)"" (I love that voice-of-God bit) and the space reggae of ""Perpetual Dawn."""
2,Ehhh....,"Well, I had some high expectations about this album. I thought I would hear a voice with that something special. Anyways, listening to it was dissappointing. I just went into that long list of music that just ""floats"" by. Not much to go give a big shout out for."
5,Mere Genius,"This publication is inspiring and yet rational. It is one of the greatest purchases I have ever made. It addresses different issues; both complex and simple, with an air of humility, while marinating a marvelously high level of academic prowess; this humble approach is something which I find most ""rational academics"" completely lack.This magazine, to which I have been a subscriber for only a year, has been one of the most influential factors to my understanding and appreciating Christ's Universal Church.I strongly recommend this to anyone who finds grace through reason; as well as anyone who is struggling to believe, but just can't seem to understand why the Church is so divided on so many things. Touchstone units the Church as C.S. Lewis did 60 years ago with plain, simple, mere Christianity."
1,USB connection in tablet fails.,I bought this tablet and at first it worked fine. However after a couple of months it started failing. I would plug it in and nothing would happen - as if it's not connecting. Juggling the cord where it attached to the tablet would cause the light to flash on and off and if you held it 'just right' it would work... for a few minutes.Now it simply does not work at all.Other than that it worked fairly well when it worked. I did not like the included software - it was difficult to use and looked 'kludgy' to me.I suppose you get what you pay for...
3,It worked for me,I am new to the OOLanguage world. I have about 5 Java books on my desk. When I try to get an explaination I read until I find one that has examples and speaks plain enough for a novist. Out of all my books this book was the only one that addressed JProgress Bars and it was plain enough for me to apply it to my code.I also used this book - from all my others to explain interfaces and abstracts.Good reference book and in plain english for someone coming from the structured language field.
2,"Not comprehensive enough, but has a couple of good examples","I've read three JFC books thus far, and this one was my least favorite. It simply doesn't have the breadth of coverage that you would expect.It's not a good reference book, because it only covers the com.sun.java.swing package. Nor does it have a comprehensive set of examples.There are a couple of case study examples that are worthwhile, if you are specifically interested in the nitty-gritty details of using JFC and printing, or JFC with JDBC, but that's about it."
4,Sounds immediately attracted my 7 year old Grandson,The musical sounds immediately attracted the attention of my 7 year old Grandson. It is a charming disc and one worth purchasing.
1,great propoganda,This book is a great example for teaching children about the pilgrims and everything they believed in such as religious freedom (except if you weren't a god fearing christian) and settling new frontiers (AKA conquering territory and making already settled people miserable) Hats off to the author for this book glorifying an essentially moronic culture.
5,The best biography of the Pilgrims currently available!,"This very factual recounting of the saga of the Pilgrims is taken largely from William Bradford's personal diary, 'Of Plimoth Plantation' and is a fast paced, and insightful look into the lives of the Pilgrims and the price they paid for religious freedom. It also accounts accurately the peaceable and friendly relations they maintained with the Indians of that region, and their mutual treaty which lasted for nearly 50 years, until the time of King Phillip's War. The amicable relations which the Pilgrims maintained with King Massasoit and Squanto reveal the noble intentions of both parties. This is an essential part of American history and should be read by all students studying this period. Adults will enjoy this one too!"
5,The Landing of the Pilgrims,The Central Texas Colony of the Society of Mayflower Descendants in the State of Texas provides each new member with a copy of The Landing of the Pilgrims by James Daugherty because the information contained in the book is fact instead of myth and the book can be easily read in an hour.
2,Nice looking but far from accurate,"I agree with others that this thermometer looks very nice. It's a shame that the temperature accuracy is completely useless.I bought it 1 year ago and it has never been accurate, not even close. Guessing the temp yourself is more accurate. At this moment, it's 92 degrees (two digital sensors are nearby) outside, but this thermometer says it's 80 degrees.I left it displayed in my back yard even though it has no purpose other than the pretty bird picture."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"When I received this thermometer, it was very scratched. The entire outside looked like someone had taken something harsh (like a brush) and went over it. I was very disappointed."
2,Trudeau mug - less than impressed,"I purchased this stainless steel mug to replace a Starbucks stainless steel mug that I lost. (The Starbucks mug kept coffee hot for several hours.)I was looking for a stainless mug with a tapered base to fit in my car's cupholder, and this cup fit perfectly. The problem with this mug is that although it is stainless steel, it only keeps the coffee hot for about an hour. I am currently using a plastic Starbucks mug that keeps coffee hot for about the same amount of time.Another thing I do not like the that the coffee has to pass through the valve apparatus, which affects the taste and limits the flow. Keep in mind I often like to gulp my coffee. Even though I clean the valve often, it seems to get dirty and affect the flavor.A spill-proof mug is not an important aspect for me, but the Trudeau did fare well in this regard."
1,This mug dribbles coffee onto your lap as you sip.,"I've been using the Trudeau travel mug for over a year now, and I really don't like it at all. What I don't like:-The mug dribbles coffee from the lid seam onto your lap as you try to sip your coffee.-The mug is difficult to wash properly because of the lid design, and also because when you immerse the body in water, water goes into the bottom of the mug and gets stuck inside sloshing around and leaking water all over you the next time you try to use the mug.-The inside of the mug is coated with some sort of polymer that gives off a neverending disagreeable smell. You cannot wash this smell away. It's still there after all this time, and it ruins the taste of the coffee.I don't understand all the reviews that say this mug is leak-proof. I have not found that to be true. I have spilled more coffee on myself with this mug than with any other travel mug I have ever used."
2,"A decent mug, but it has poor insulation","If you like to drink your coffee fast, this is the mug for you! Even with preheating, coffee only stays hot for 2 hours. The outside of the mug feels warm immediately after filling. I expected better performance. Other features are fine such as the stylish look and tight seal, but for an extra five bucks you can get a top of the line travel mug that performs its core function better."
4,Amazing!!,"Alright Listen close. I have very few words to share about this mug but they are critical.!) Toss it off of the top of a flight of stairs and you will not loose a single drop of liquid.2) Keeps the liquid temp longer than I need to drink the contents relative to it size3) The twist top sticks sometimes depending on the temperature of the liquid because it creates a vacuum. All you have to do when this happens is push down on the twist part firmly or twist the top to release pressure. Otherwise you will get an unexpected spritz of hot coffee in face while drinking.4) Otherwise the solitary simple defect is a good reminder to me that in this world nothing is absolutely perfect, yet. A good start to a great day. Enjoy your coffee!!"
3,ok,"I bought this for my wife for X-mas. It came in a hurry! However, i did not realize it had a handle. She hates handles on her mugs! End of story"
2,Doesn't flow; big disappointment,"I had the prior version of this mug and loved it. As other posters have noted, Trudeau unfortunately changed the design of the lid for the worse. The new lid, which screws into the mug, does not permit an adequate flow of the coffee when it is in the open position. Drinking it while I drove my car, I had to literally lean my head back and use gravity to get enough coffee to come out. That lead to the coffee leaking onto my shirt (which I should have seen coming). I tried to loosen the screw on the bottom of the lid as others mentioned, but I still can't get enough coffee to come out of it when it's in the open position. I don't have the same problems with it leaking that some others have mentioned, but that just tells me that this is an inconsistent, poorly made product."
3,Missing seal on lid.,"I like the Trudeau Drive Time Travel Mug very much except for the leaking lid.It is supposed to be ""Guaranteed Leak Proof"" but it dribbles coffee down the front of my shirt due to the missing seal on the lid.If you could find it in your heart to just to send me a seal it would be greatly appreciated.Your Valued Customer,Robert E. Mosely"
2,Sometimes drips steam water out the bottom!,You have to be careful to screw the cap on well or it will leak. Steam water sometimes drips out the bottom through the inner lining. It can also trap water inside and fail to completely dry when left upside down.
2,Junk Warning,"I bought a Trudeau coffee mug, looks good, but if they would have tested their mugs before they ship them out, which they do not....the gasket in these mugs LEAKS...you have been warned. Just remember how beyond irritating it is when you drip hot coffee down your top or your lap.....you buy this it will be your own fault, you were warned."
2,Imposter,"I so badly want to replace the Trudeau that I got 15 years ago. It has the screw in lid and is completely leak proof. It is still almost as good today as the day I got it. This model is a poor imposter and the best coffee mug design ever has apparently been shelved for smaller, crappier ones. This is probably not a terrible mug, but it's not the one I was looking for!"
4,great mug no leak,"Ok to the people who say this mug leakes: no, it doesnt.When you screw it on a little coffee/tea can find its way up between the lid and the mug. Close the lid and tip it over to let this excess fluid leak out in teh sink/trash whatever. Shake it up to make sure its all gone, and you'll see - this mug doesnt leak.You're dumb. You're all dumb.Mug's great. Insulation isnt ideal, but still way better than a regular coffee cup or something. Get it!!!"
2,not as good as my older Trudeau Travel Mug,"I purchased this to try and replace my older Trudeau Travel Mug that had a screw in lid. This new ""Drivetime"" mug is not as good, because it leaks... Not a lot, but enough to stain my car, backpack, shirt, etc..Otherwise it is very similar to the older mug. In regards to insulation it keeps my coffee hot for two hours as advertised, and that's plenty for me. It's also easy to drink out of, but then so is the old one.. and the old one doesn't leak!"
4,travel mug,"I just love these.They keep the coffe hot for the two hours. It a litter hard to get the drink to flow,how once you get the hang of it . it great"
5,Not cancer causing like those plastic mugs!,This is a great mug for the price! It is stainless steel on both the outside and inside which is exactly what I was looking for. Most 18 oz mugs are a lot more expensive. More importantly it is stainless steel on the inside. Plastic coffee mugs may be a little bit cheaper but you're paying more with your health with the cancer causing chemicals that leak out in the plastic mugs. We're very happy with this product!
3,Very good selection,"I'm satisified with the Trudeau selection of this travel mug because it is spill proof and has a turn cap and a lock that keeps the water cold, even when the car gets very hot, and the handle on its side is comfortable to use"
3,not great,The cup is very tippy and forces you to tip the cup very high in order to drink. I would not recommend this cup.
4,Trudeau Drive-time travel mugs are excellent!,"Very fast delivery time! My wife and I love the travel mugs; we've owned several over the years (lost several) and have given many away as gifts. They work as advertised, what better praise?"
2,Don't Do It!!!,"It looks nice. It's easy to hold. I can't tell you if it keeps coffee warm, because most of it landed on my white blouse. It leaked the very first time I used it. I'm not talking about a drop now and then; I'm talking about major leakage. You're better of with the plastic mugs from the convenience store. Too much money for too little quality."
2,comfortable handle is where this one ends!,"The Trudeau Drivetime Travel Mug has a very comfortable handle with a solid seat for your thumb, but that's where it ends. The Twist-top lock prevents any ADDITIONAL liquid from escaping; however after you've taken a sip, residual liquid sits in the 360 degree slits. Even when locked that portion will spill everytime. This mug does NOT hold its contents Hot as long as my Starbucks version; although it does outlast the plastic travel mugs. With so many holes to drink out of, when you get to the bottom of your cup and tip it up, your coffee starts to pour out too many holes and ends up going around your mouth and down your chin. I work in a dusty environment and like the flip top mugs because it actually protects the drinking area from getting dirty. The twist top locks the drink from under the lid, so any dirt or dust sits on the entire drinking area and is always exposed. This will do the job, but there's many other options that I would prefer."
2,Don't bother,"I bought two for my husband to take to work. Good size, look nice and keep coffee pretty warm however both leak and started leaking from 1st use. Have only had them a few weeks and have already thrown one of them out. The other doesn't leak as bad so he wraps a face cloth around it to catch the drips. It's ridiculous really. Don't bother."
2,OK if you don't mind coffee all over you....,"After using the cup for a while I've decided I'm not very happy with it. It does seem to be constructed well and the inside is stainless, however it has some significant draw backs. The most significant is that because the lid pours from a complete circle all the way around as opposed to a single opening, if you tilt the cup too much the liquid will come out from everywhere and end up running down your face and onto your clothes (easy to do when driving). Also, the handle comes down so far that it does not fit into most car cup holders well because the handle hits the center console and it doesn't sit flat. Lastly, (very minor complaint) when I first got the cup no liquid would come out because the screw controlling the flow was way too tight and I had to loosen it to be able to drink anything.I guess I'll keep searching for a good all stainless travel mug....."
2,Disappointed,When I try to drink from the cup very little of the liquid comes out. I tried to adjust screw of lid as was suggested. It worked but next time I used it it went back to allowing very little of liqui to come out. I like the design etc but the lid is not good for drinking from.
5,Surprising Nielsen from Vanska,"I've heard Vanska's other Nielsen recordings and generally don't like them, but I have to admit this is one of the finest recordings of the 1st. (My other favorite readings include Chung and Rozhdestvensky.) In other symphonies like the 4th, Vanska tends toward a blustery and overly fast and vehement treatment that really fails to capture the scale, depth, and majesty of the music. Here, however, his tempos are perfectly judged, and even the ""pastoral"" dreaminess of the second movement comes through. Arguably some of the tympani playing in the first movement is overly vehement, but this performance nevertheless is first rate and I listen to it often, as the 1st is one of my favorite Nielsen symphonies."
4,"5-star movie, 1-star picure quality","I LOVE this movie and looked for it on VHS and DVD for quite awhile before it was available on Amazon, and while it's just as funny as I remembered, the picture quality of this DVD is terrible. The company that produced it should have tried to get a better-quality source video---there must be one out there because the picture quality was not this bad when I last saw this movie on television back in 2000. At least Amazon has lowered the price; when I bought this DVD from them a couple of years back it was $28.95.But all picture complaining aside, this movie is wonderful and my family loved watching our home-recorded VHS copy every Christmas for years. :)"
5,Simply Hilarious,"One of the funniest movies i have ever seen, it is pure genius. I have seen it about ten times, and ever time it gets better. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie is missing out. I have watched it at least once every Christmas since the first time i saw it."
4,Family Tradition,"This movie has become a tradition in our family. We only watch it at Christmas and sometimes at Easter, then it goes up on the closet until next year. It's an extremely funny vid, Lenny Henry is hilarious. It's at the top of the feel-good movie list without a doubt."
5,Bernard and the Genie,"We have been looking for this movie forever..... and finally found it on Amazon.com. Thank you!! We just love it, great Christmas movie..."
3,Don't judge a movie by its cover..,I have hunted for this movie for years - One of my absolute favourite movies! DVD quality is not great however. It is very hard to find copies in good quality but is a fantastic movie worth watching.
3,What a great cast...but not their greatest work,"I searched high and low for this title before finding it at Amazon. In it Lenny Henry plays a genie plunked down in modern day. So many new conveniences to enjoy and so much to catch up on he doesn't what to do first. Alan Cummings plays his geekie master who is in the process of experiencing the ultimate worst day ever at the hands of his evil boss played by Rowan Atkinson. Worse still it is Christmas. It is a diverting change from other Christmas movies. With a phenomenal cast I had high expectations for this title, but this made for TV movie fails to sparkle. The real problem is that there is no new ground covered in this film."
3,Bernard and the Genie,The quality of the DVD was absolutely below par.Colors where really bad and the whole looked like a analog video.
4,Funny Comedy,Bernard and the Genie;A very funny movie. The characters were perfect for their parts. I would recommend this to everyone.
5,Found the DVD Listing by Accident,"This came up during a search for something unrelated. I've been waiting for a DVD release of Bernard & the Genie for years, though.I urge Amazon to add links to DVD releases on corresponding VHS pages. They have links on some pages, but not all. There's a ton of VHS entries in my wish list which I check weekly to see if there's been a DVD release.Also, some VHS pages have links to DVD pages which offer e-mail notification of release as well as voting for the release. Amazon, I've got a long list of films which I'd like to vote for DVD release. How about putting more of these links onto your VHS pages?Five star movie. Great for the whole family. My kids still quote lines from it and break up.Now why isn't Lenny Henry's ""Chef"" TV series on DVD? Just 20 episodes. Should sell as many copies as Fawlty Towers. Would you please create a page so that we may vote for such a DVD release?Apologies to readers -- this is primarily a message to Amazon, not a review."
3,more smut memories,The Other Half was from Fostoria OH. Could always catch them at the 224 Club.I've still got my LP but glad to find a CD
5,Hilarious Stuff,"I was traded this CD when it was an album back in 1979 from a friend whose mother worked for the state liquor control board.... She ran into this group after going to a local Columbus, Ohio club (I think Other Half is from here) that she had inspected days earlier and then decided to visit as a customer in her off hours. The lead singer signed the album, ""To Mari (Mary) Juana (Wanner...how I'd love to see your Licker (Liquor) Bored (Board)!"" When I moved to Florida several years later, an old roommate stole it from me when she moved out. I forgave her because she fell in love with the record. I tried for years to find a replacement and when I finally did on Amazon I was thrilled to be able to purchase it. The title song ""SMUT"" will stay with you until you drive friends and family nuts when you sing it to them for the 100th time. Besides being a group labeled as ""Comedy"" rockn-rollers, several cuts on the album that are not comical are decent old-fashioned rock-n-roll worthy a listen."
2,LACKS QUALITY,"It is not what I was looking for, for the following reasons:1. The fabric is loose in the center because the upper pole is not bent enough at top which allows the center to sag.2. The instructions are both incomplete and misleading.Overall, the adage ""You get what you paid for"" describes it."
2,Tailgate net,"This product did not work out very well for me. The net was too tall for my truck (a GMC Sierra), the netting did not seem to fit the frame very well and the instructions are pretty bad. It's a good concept but not very well executed. I returned it."
2,Quality lacking,"The net for the tailgate was not manufactured to the quality that I expected. When installed, the center portion of the net fit loosely between the upper and lower poles. This would have caused the net to flap excessively when driving at highway speeds. In addition, the net for the fabric is very thin reinforced vinyl. This material, however, does seem quite strong."
2,Tailgate net,"It needs some work. The net is made out of pretty thin material and is always sliding to the sides. There's no way to secure the net so no one steals it. The mounting hardware leaves much to be desired, it is loose and flops around."
3,highland tailgate net v-net,"good product for the cost.. had a little trouble understanding the instruction. had to do a little modify to make it fit my 2010 truck. but all in all I am satisfied with the product,"
1,not up to par,"this product was light weight and vinly , I was disappointed in the look of this product and very cheap looking"
2,Kinda weird to install,This product is very strange to install. The instructions are very unclear and you have to use your imagination a lot to get the job done
4,Great debut B3 album,"With the emergence of Joey DeFrancesco in the beginning of the '90's revitalizing the Hammond B3 organ, more great B3 youngsters came to the surface. One of them was Larry Goldings, originally a pianist working with Jon Hendricks and JIm Hall among others, this great CD is his debut album on the organ and his debt to the Jimmy Smith tradition is obvious at the recording time. Pairing with Peter Bernstein on gitar and the ""wonderboy"" Bill Stewart on drums, this a tight quality trio plays standards like ""Skylark"" and ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" with demand and control. Veteran tenor saxofonist David ""Fathead"" Newman add punch and colour to some of the tunes but not at a level expected from that man. For B3 afficiados - notice a unfamiliar jazz organ sound on Goldings B3 since he's using a vibrato registration that is more convenient to the theatre organ tradition...shaky but doesn't diminish the overall quality of the album."
3,Doesn't engage my baby. .. .,"It's durable, buttons are easy for baby's little hands to press, and it's a good idea for a take along toy. However, it just doesn't engage my daughter. She was about 4 mos when I purchased it for her, probably too young, but now, at 10+ months, she still has no interest. It says it's age appropriate from 6 mos, but this is better for an older baby - at an age that they can comprehend/appreciate changing the modes of play on the toy, and such. My daughter loves the pop up toys (press a button and a character pops out of something and music or s/thing of the like plays), she has the Baby Einstein and Sesame Street ones, so she understands cause and effect, but this toy just doesn't do it for her. We'll see as she grows older whether she ever becomes interested."
2,GET THE ORIGINAL & READ THAT---- JEEZ.,"READY? MARSHALL SAUNDERS, BEAUTIFUL JOE C. 1893 THEN THE SEQUEL, BEAUTIFUL JOE'S PARADISE, C. 1902?This story does not need to be dumbed down. You can get a new edition of the original here through Amazon, and the sequel can be picked up at online book shops that sell used/rare books."
5,The Story of Beautiful joe,"I live very close to Beautiful Joe Park in Meaford, Ontario which is the burial place of Beautiful Joe. I wished to learn more about this remarkable animal and definately had my wish come true with this book. I suggest it to anyone who enjoys stories of the true animal spirit."
2,The Real Thing ??,"I have NOT read this book but have been looking for thre original story by Marshall Saunders for years .. I notice this author also has a version of Black Beauty that is rated as ""pre-school"" reading level ... since the rating and number of pages are missing from this posting, how is one to know what one is getting ???"
5,Heart warming and compassionate story.,"What a story! We see humanity in a new light. Dogs truly are a man's best friend, but man can be a dog's worst enemy."
5,"Ahhh, bliss...","Just as Sugar ""copegirl"" has so adequately and eloquently stated, this group and this CD are truly wonderful. I have a very bad habit of getting new music and, regardless of the genre, playing it to death for a couple of weeks, becoming tired of it and relegating it to the bottom of the never-played-again-stack. Not so with Bliss. I loved this so much that about six months ago, I tracked down the ONLY OTHER TWO albums available in the US (""Afterlife"" and ""They Made History""), and play the combined playlist every day or two. It is a ""must"" in the car to combat rush hour hysterics and is great for road trips. It is great background music when having people in. I've given QL as small gifts, and without exception, the giftees love the CD and want more. I read there was to have been a new CD here in the US in November--I believe the title may be ""No One Built This Moment.""(Where is it, anyone know?) Jonesing for more of these superb musicians and their music!"
5,Intriguing,"This is a remake of the european CD which was released last year. Four songs have been replaced with songs from their first album. Still a truly superb album - in any way you want to see it. Smooth and blissful music from Denmark.Now - what REALLY puzzles me is why they still call it ""Quiet Letters""... The title track is no longer included on this U.S.-version."
5,I feel blissed!,I am very amazed that there are not enough reviews for this gem. If you are looking for a unique experience then you must consider this CD. I have heard many of their tracks on other CD's such as Buddha Bar and Cafe Del Mar. It is very understandable why some of the most predominant music producers are attracted to their music.
4,"Schubert Symphony No 9 - Rattle, Berliner Philamoniker","The horn solo in the Andante introduction to the first movement has a distant, eerily, magical timbre - and Rattle revels in its plushly upholstered fabric, while observing and emphasizing the rhythmic accents, especially in the scherzo and finale, to a degree that would have been inimical to his predecessor. Rattle's tempi for the first two movements are spacious and flowing, allowing him to alight on exquisite details without losing sight of the bigger picture."
2,Is this what Rattle really means?,"Simon Rattle has avoided Schubert's music for twenty years, and having put a toe in the water, he's outdone by a masterpiece. It's hard to believe such finicky, over-pointed phrasing is really sincere. Maybe Rattle's trying to bring Schubert into the canon of clipped, shallow period Beethoven. Whatever the intention, this is charmless conducting and playing, without an ounce of relaxation or joyful high spirits. Absent those qualities--so perfecttly captured by Beehcam's recordings of the early symphonies--it's pointless to fiddle while Schubert burns. Many other conductors have given us memorable Ninths--my favorites are Bernstein on Sony, Klemperer on EMI, and Sinopoli on DG--but this is far from adding to the list."
2,The reviews are for the wrong performance!,"The performance is, according to the description, by Jansug Kakhidze, Tbilisi Symphony Orchestra, not Rattle. What's going on? Did I download Kakhidze or Rattle? It would be nice to know. The performance I heard sounded pretty lightweight compared to others I've heard, but I don't know who's performance I heard."
4,for the uninitiated,"If you are new linux or are thinking of building out a linux box then this is a decent place to start. The basics of unix style administration are explained about as plainly and simply as possible. One short coming of the book is the lengthy discussion of installation which admittedly used to be a harrowing experience 5 or so years ago (seemingly the main argument against the adoption of linux by microserfs), but in the hands of Red Hat has become nearly as painless a process as any windows install and therefore is not that necessary. The only other problem with this book is that the version of Red Hat is 8.0 (3rd edition) i believe and only has some middle variant of the 2.4 kernel (2.4.17 i think), this is not necessarily bad but the 2.6 kernel is out and Red Hat has a new approach to the desktop with its Fedora build. Only buy this if you are completely new to linux and want to learn the basics."
3,Beware of the tricky nanny!,"This book is meant to literally take your hand so you can be walked from Gates to Tornvals with no pain, but in the end you have to go RTFM, just because the book is plenty of errata and falls into tricky omissions. You can have a damn hard time installing the system if anything does not go just like the book says. And chances are it won't. So if you expect to turn this half-caring guide into Your Linux Nanny, be prepared to fall under some Murphy's laws. Besides, this is only a tiny taste of penguin's meat. I wonder if it would just have been swell to start with O'Reilly's Running Linux."
3,Can't rate because it did not meet my needs,"I wanted a book that could help me with fedora in TEXT MODE. This book looked great and obviously, books from Oreilly are always good so I bought it.This book is absolutely NOT a good book to learn Fedora in TEXT MODE because the book is about graphic mode and it wasn't said somewhere. It's all about GNOME and KDE.Be sure you use the graphic mode before buying!"
3,Good intro to Linux...,"This book was a 4 star book just 4 months ago. Today, it is quickly slipping into the realm of dinosaurs as a function of its aging CDs, which feature Red Hat Linux v7.2. If you are interested in exploring Linux, this is one of the lesser-expensive ways to get started, and RHL 7.2 is at least a viable starting point for most newbies.I used the book a couple of times to try to figure out something specific to Linux, but the content is little more than a command summary similar to what the man pages offer and a basic installation and configuration guide.At the cover price as sold by Amazon, you can not beat this for a gift of Linux or other way of getting your hands on CDs...without downloading the files for ""free."""
4,"Need to read this book first, if you are a windows user.","This is a great book for people who is currently using Microsoft Windows and wants to venture to RH OS. It has all neccessary informations to have your RH OS install and running. I would have give this book a 5 star, but for RH book, it just mentioning the word Microsoft to much."
1,For Dummies !,"I'm really disappointed, the contents are just full of steps for installations. Many screenshots of installation screens. I think this's book is just for dummies which use linux just for the first time and for fun. Too short descriptions, not clear enough."
2,Learning Red Hat Linux,"This book's target audience is obviously the Linux newbie, not just Red Hat newbies. For someone experienced in using Linux, this probably is not a book you would want to purchase. The book does, however, go into some decent newbie level tutorials. What I found to be less desirable was the amount of reliance this book had on linuxconf which, as an experienced Linux user, I prefer not to use. Best I can tell, linuxconf is generally not the admin tool of choice. The book did go into other options, but not to the extent that I had hoped."
4,Only Beginners Should Apply,"A good book ... for beginners. If you're just starting out, this is for you. Although more should have gone into the intracacies of the installation, this is still a good book. Note that if you are Linux Hack, stay away. This book has nothing for you. Check out Running Linux, 3rd Ed. (O'Reilley & Ass.) instead."
2,"Only symbols and images, no concepts!","This book does tell you some essential things about LINUX, but this is not enough at all. Being surrounded by pictures and tips, I really can't learn anything that concerns the main part of LINUX. It is no better than a thickened Redhat user's manual! Too Pratical! If you really want to ""LEARN"" LINUX, you'd better go and buy RUNING LINUX which is far better than this book!"
5,Great Book,"The first thing that impressed me was the way Learning Red Hat Linux was written. It read more like a novel then a technical manual/book, and I found myself excited to see what was on the next page. The book is a quick get-you-started guide that explains what you need to know then moves on and does not spend too much time dilly-dallying.There were some things that were skimmed over, but the author pointed out web sites that went into more detail. The chapter on shell scripting was a great introduction. For novice Linux users it is a great way to get your fingertips wet with the powerful command line, and shell scripting. The book quickly explains how to set up samba, ftp, email, Apache and SSH, as well as an introduction to the RPM package manager.Added bonus was the two Red Hat 7.2 CD's so I didn't have to download them.Microsoft OS readers should NOT pickup up this book, it will make you want to format your OS and install Linux, it did for me!"
4,Good for beginers!,"With so many books about Linux on the market, it is really a difficult to know which books are good and which are not. Learning Red Hat Linux, published by O'Reilly at their famous book series, shows the basic steps at the Linux world, based on the Red Hat distribution. This book doesn't show Linux's advanced configurations, but this is the greatest point of this work: it is a very easy, quick and pratical guide for all those who need to quickly learn this new operating system and doesn't want to spend time reading complicated and hard to understand books."
2,Very basic introduction to Linux,"I did not like this book. I found all of what was in book just on the Linux website. I was hoping for a detailed introduction to Linux. For instance, it covered the steps involved with installing red hat linux by describing the options you had at each point, but not what each option means. A list of options I can get from the screen, I need help on what those options mean."
5,"Stellar, a first class work on Native education",This was a truly wonderful and accessible book about Native American educational achievment. The story of Dartmouth College and its relationship to Native American education is captivating. The honesty of the students is at time heartbreaking and yet is continually inspiring.
2,A used broom???,"I was disappointed to find that i received what appears to be a used broom. Is this what companies do? They take advantage that we as online customers do not have access to seeing the actual product and so they send used/not-as-new products that cannot be sold on the floors??The broom works like it should. But looking at the bristles and the dustpan, it is apparent the broom was used. There is dust/lint on the bristles and the dustpan has scratch marks. The broom box itself shows signs of tear, like it was used again."
2,OK broom for the price,Was easy to assemble. it is no different than the inexpensive brooms that you get from a market.
2,Works but doesn't snap together properly,"I had some problem getting the pieces to snap together properly. It still works but the separate pieces don't make a perfect seel with each other. Other than that... its a broom, what do ya expect?"
2,might have liked it if it didn't come broken,"it seemed like a nice product, but I never even opened the box, because the dustpan was broken."
1,bad battery,"I bought a cell phone battery, charged it and I keep getting the message ""invalid battery"". Same type battery from another company works fine on another cell phone. I think battery isn't good. I emailed the sales department but never got a reply."
2,Terrible Comedy Experience,"I went on a road trip recently and purchased about 5 or 6 comedy CD's. This was one of them and was easily the worst of the lot.I am rating it 2 stars but it really was a one-star experience. Repetitive without being cleverly so, unsophisticated without guffaws, neither subtle nor over-the-top... I am amazed to find that so many people before me actually enjoyed this. I wasn't offended, confused, or alienated by the content. I was bored. To give you an idea: If a joke like ""I tried smoking mushrooms once but couldn't keep the pizza lit"" followed by the non-infectious chuckling of the comedian himself... if hearing a comedian try to commiserate with you on how everybody's sisters just barge into the bathroom and put on makeup while you are taking a dump... If these are your cup of tea, then by all means drink this. You are in for a full CD of this kind of stuff. Very disappointing."
2,Funny once in awhile,"This cd is funny once in awhile. Listening to once a week is deadly. Larry is funny but then ruins his jokes by saying I dont care who you are, thats funny or the every annoying and over exposed GIT R DONE!!!!!!!!!!!! Very sick jokes about incest."
5,AWSOME AND EXCELLENT,"What can you say about the highest grossing comic of today. an awsome cd, extremely funny."
4,Go pick This CD up! you will Laugh!,"Hey ya'll just wanting to let you know about some awesome comedy CD's and DVD's that I just reviewed. ""Lord I Apologize"" By the one and only Larry the Cable Guy is on sale now. You can also see or hear Larry on the successful Blue Collar Comedy Tour, CD or DVD along with tour mates Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and Ron White . Lord I Apologize offers funny adult humor for all hitting on funny incidents about People Liking his Analogies, from the hilarious Larry the Cable Guy song. Laughter is the best medicine so get out there get the Cd and like he says ""git -R- Done"". I rate ""Lord I Apologize"" 8 outta 10."
4,Cats for Dummies,"Item was in good condition with a crease in the cover that was not noted in its description. Otherwise, the book was great."
4,"Honest, light-hearted, and informative.","""Cats for Dummies"" is an honest, light-hearted, and informative guidebook.Though authors Gina Spadafori and Paul D. Pion, DVM, focus on ""the fun and easy way to find the kitten or cat who's right for you,"" they cover a variety of basic and enlightening feline information.The chapters range from ""Choosing Your Feline Companion"" and ""Feeding Your Cat"" to ""Solving Behavior Problems"" and ""Ten Common Household Dangers to Your Cat.""Two particularly eye-opening chapters are ""Ten Cat Myths--Debunked"" (e.g., All Callicos are Females) and ""Understanding Your Cat"" (cats, it turns out, aren't color blind).Many of the illustrations and b&w photos could have been clearer. Otherwise, this primer and reference work is highly-recommended."
5,Great info and funny,"This book is easy to read, has tons of information, and has humor mixed in. There is good preventive medicine tips and good ideas on how to discipline cats. This is the best book on cats I have seen in a while. Definatly not dry or boring."
5,Needed This,"I have owned cats for years, but, there was so much I did not know until I obtained this book. I was in the process of adopting a new cat after euthanizing my previous one of 16 years, and decided to purchase this book. Ended up kicking myself because I could have used some of these techniques with my previous cats.Anyhow, I feel more armed with better information to become an even better consumer and advocate for my new cat, Sleepy."
5,"Is there any subject for which there isn't a ""Dummies"" book?","This is an excellent information book about cats. It is informative, fun, and I think well written. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to have a reference guide to help understand your felines.I also recommend Cat Owner's Home Veterinary Handbook for anyone wanting more detailed medical info. relating to diseases, treatment options, pictures, etc. I found it to be easy to understand and well written."
4,Very good!,"I always use it for reference when there's something I don't know. Very informative, easy to read and useful."
3,What a story!,"Hi,This kind of info is amazingly hard to get in out media culture in the USA. Joseph did another good job and a fitting tribute to his father.Thanks. God Bless.Aaron."
2,Disappointing,"I needed help on Windows 98 and bought this book because of the Author. It's the first book of his I've bought and the last. He is verbose. I needed steak - not sizzle.Further, I don't believe the author really knows what he's talking about. I needed help on hooking up an ethernet printer on a peer-to-peer network. This doesn't strike me as rocket science. Instead, I get pages of the history of networking. Who cares.I then needed help on an ODBC issue. No coverage is this ""Complete Guide"".I wanted quick, bulletized text on issues that a user would expect to find in a complete guide. If I had a fire place - this would be in it."
2,Easy money for the authors.,"If you own the book ""Peter Norton's Complete Guide to Windows 95"" 1998 edition, then you don't need this one. Everything you must do is to replace ""Windows 95"" for ""Windows 98"" in all the book and you'll get 95% of this book. I am really disappointed with this one."
2,Not what I had in mind!,It's a nice heavy power wire and that's it. It's being used to power my hometheater sub. Cant tell if there's a difference. But one thing that is Anoying is that the pluging that gos to the sub is is to big for the cord. Along with a different sub as well. So it dosnt stay in very good. Overall I wouldn't recommend it. Especially the price.
4,It takes a lot of time and practice,"The graphics in this game were somewhat bad, but the game itself is very amusing. Some levels are fun and some make you want to tear your hair out. I like the fact that Bugs Bunny literally lives on 6 hit points (from what I remember) and basically infinite lives. There were ton of levels in the game where it takes a lot of time and practice to get right and sometimes they become frustrating. It actually took me years to finally complete this game one time. As a kid and even for adults, this game is enjoyable."
3,HARD!!!,"THIS IS HARD!!!!!!!! YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!!! I got this game Christmas 1999, and I am still can't get past this one part! No one seems to be able to eaither! If you like easy games, or if you get frustrated, then DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!! RENT IT FIRST!!!!"
5,This game was great!,"My husband & I loved this game! It's not too hard, but you have to be smart to get 100%. The graphics are great and hours go by before you know it. You get to ski and ride a rocket skateboard (which is hard), as well as defeat some of Bugs' legendary enemies!"
4,You'll like it its fun.,"I like this game, but... After a while it gets frustrating. It is fun seeing characters from the cartoon, but when you get to the 1930's world, and the Martians world, you get fists of fury. I recommend renting the game before buying it. But don't think of it as the worst game on the planet either. Hey, I liked it! Don't give it to 5-year-old gamers that are way too used to stuff like Spyro and Crash, because it gets frustratingly hard in some places. Happy game playing!"
4,Bugs,"This game if a must for gamers of all ages who enjoy animated characters. Fun puzzles, lots of action."
4,Another Great Waverly Novel,"I love the Waverly books by Sir Walter Scott. This one concerns two families on different sides of religious and political disputes in England. Of course the son of one family and the daughter of the other are in love - kind of like Romeo and Juliet in England without the death at the end. There is action and romance, evil plotting and violence, and just when you think the bad guys are all black they do things that surprise you. Not only a good history lesson but a thumping good read. I recommend it highly."
2,edited version,title was what i expected from dirctor but the version was edited for excessive nudity. italian movie dubbed in english. dubbing actors not very good. over all i would have looked for italian version.
2,Extremely Mixed Bag,"As a big fan of the first two Bech collections, I carefully rationed my reading of this one, limiting myself to one story per day. All was well until I reached ""Bech Noir"" in which our hero takes murderous (yet flippant) revenge on his literary enemies. This was so ludicrously out of character that I kept waiting for the authorial signal that it was just the protagonist's fantasy. Unfortunately, it never came. I don't know whether Updike was being contemptuous or just plain stupid. But not only did his trashing of my suspension-of-disbelief ruin this book for me, it cast a retrospective pall over the previous ones.Ironically, a new first-rate Bech story appeared in The New Yorker some time later. Presumably, it will be included in the omnibus Bech edition being published in 2001. I only pray that Updike, who is known for his post-publication tinkering, will come to his senses and leave ""Bech Noir"" out."
4,Intermittently terrific,"Updike does seem a bit weary as Michiko Kakutani noted for The Times in this book...still, weary Updike is better than most other authors at their liveliest. If you haven't read any of the Bech books before, don't start with this one. Read the earlier ones in order and you'll enjoy this one better. Has its moments."
4,Enjoyed First Experience With Updike,"John Updike is one of those names I had always heard of but had never checked out. Finally, a few weeks ago, I decided that it was time for me to get acquainted with Mr. Updike. I must say that the first work I chose to read of his did not disappoint me.Bech at Bay is the last in a series of books that feature Henry Beck, and aged writer who still manages to find himself in precarious adventures. Bech at Bay is a series of short stories that loosely make up a larger story. At times hilarious, at times insightful, and at times rather disturbing, I found myself quite pleased with Mr. Updike's work. I look forward to reading more of it.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"
2,"James Markus, you are a dolt","John Updike is NOT Nabokov's equal in any sense, let alone in the realm of the metaphysical novel, in which Nabokov is and will forever remain God. Updike, unlike Nabokov, is constantly begging the reader to pity his nasty, dull protagonists. Everything seems to go right for them, despite their best efforts to fail and feel sorry for themselves, yet we're expected to cheer them allong and cry for them when they experience minor setbacks? No thanks. Nabokov's multi-layored gems offer no easy heroes and no simple-minded moral messages. That said, I think Updike can be really good. The Centaur is a wonderfull book, and some of his short fiction is great. His serially-destributed fiction is, however, far to long-winded and thick-headed and self-serving to be compared to anything by Nabokov. If Nabokov has an American successor, it's Pynchon or Barth, not Updike."
5,love her music,"saw her in Hoover Alabama - ordered this album - will buy another - she is just terrific and this album certainly does not dissappoint - if you get a chance to see her live, she is worth it."
4,"Good, but not what I expected","I thought it would be more trad fiddle. But, it's a fun CD to listen to!"
4,Great book from yesteryear that is so TODAY,"John Dewey explains how the philosophy of rugged individualism derived from the frontier era is out of place in industrialized, corporatized America."
4,Be Aware!!!,Many of the sellers here are not selling the cd that is listed but rather some guy who happened to call himself Angel and named the cd Angel too. Write the seller before you buy to make sure they didn't screw up.
5,Ok..I'm 18 so I'm not a kid but I don't feel like signing up,"I accidentily found Lydia when I was looking fror These Green Eyes, [love them]and I fell in love. They are a [much needed] breath of fresh muscial air. The guy vocals are ash soft, but can hold more passion then I've heard in a while. The girl vocals are average, but when the two vocals are mixed you have an unbeatable sound. The lyrics are a bit weird, but they work in some odd way. My favorite songs from them are, ""December"" and ""In Your Blood"". I have to admit I do enjoy a good Pop=punk band everynow and again, but these guys will definatly be in my player a lot longer than any pop-punk. In two words: They're Great.-steph"
1,price!,why is this cd so expensive!!i really want this album but really 179 dollars it breaks my heart=[ please help me
4,Good story: unpredictable and imaginative plot,"This is a good story. The plot develops quite quickly and goes in several unexpected directions. The main character is a nice down-to-earth, average kind of guy. His aggressive lack of ambition is a nice, cynical twist to the conventional ""I want to save the world"" attitude.The synopsis at the end was a nice touch to tie up all the ""loose ends.""A map or two would be really nice, but is not terribly necessary."
2,Could Barely Stay Awake,"While the book was written well grammatically, the overall presentation of the story was very dull. There was a great deal of detail but it was all presented in a manner that left me with a ""Yeah, so what?"" feeling. The main character starts out as a lazy, self-centered teenager and perhaps he improved a little by the end of the book but really, who cares? This is the only book by this author that I have read and it does not encourage me to read any others."
2,Standard Formula,"Predictable plot, sketchy locale, good dialogue, sterotypical characters individuated by anachronistic twentieth century quips in an otherwise medieval mileau. The author has written this book several times under different titles with re-named characters in various locales. Reminiscent of Heinlein's ""Glory Road"" without fully realized characters. If you haven't already read one of Lawrence Watt-Evan's books it's definitely worth the price, worth reading for enjoyment, not worth re-reading. If you have read one of his books you know what your getting. Buy it, if you want more of the same. I borrowed my copy."
4,Good for Thinking,"Provoking thoughts for people who are healthcare providers (Home Health Aids, Hospice Workers, Nurses, Doctors, caretakers). Helps you consider various postive or balanced ways to view the journey of death."
5,Great Book!,Emily has written a great book that enables those of us who don't know how to cook to learn to cook very well!
3,Baking for Dummies review,"Actually, this is exactly what it says. I was hoping for a bit more info but this was exactly as advertised so I guess I'm the ""dummy"". No complaints."
4,Timex has the best designed alarm I have ever seen,"The alarm feature on this watch is extremely useful. It is easy and simple to set an alarm for a few minutes or a specific time of day. It is especially useful when negotiating with my children, who often request ""5 more minutes"".The reason I did not give 5 stars is the leather band began to stretch from the first day, and broke after less than a year. Also, the dial for the alarm became very difficult to turn after a few months. I eventually used a citric degreaser which fixed it right up."
3,Internet in a BIND,"Given the history of security flaws with BIND, and its inferior performance compared to some other DNS server packages (such as DJBDNS), I found so large a book to be woefully inadequate in representing DNS as an Internet protocol, instead painting it merely as a supported feature of BIND."
5,By far the best DNS introduction,This book is the best investment I have made in my knowledge of DNS. I think any network admin should have this book on their desk at all times. It should become a bed side reading for anybody who is serious about TCP/IP protocols. DNS may be a pretty tricky topic to understand for many people. It uses both TCP and UDP for its queries and gets pretty convoluted as you dive into it. This books demystifies it very well. There is a very clear distinction between zones and domains. I have not seen that many materials clearly explaining the difference between the two. The book gives you a taste of what threats you may face running a DNS server. It explains how to perform zone transfers and zone delegations and clearly defines which suite of protocols is used to accomplish it.This book can be a reference as well as a textbook read. I recommend it to all people out on the internet.
5,Mandatory for a network administrator,Great book! it is mandatory for a network administrator to understand DNS.Frank Huang System Administrator Monitor Aerospace Corp.
5,Domain Names...Serves us!,"This is the most complete and must-have DNS book i've ever seen before. Nor only prepares you to understand every basic and some advanced issues about DNS, it also shows a lot of ""tricks"" with the most powerfull and well know - famous DNS implementation!: BIND.If you are a beginner in the DNS world, this is a good step towards become an expert, if you're already an expert this guide will surely show you a lot of useful information in your daily DNS administration problems.Definitely, this was one of my best investments on my way to become a site administrator."
5,Excellent,"I was new to administering DNS when I first bought the book, and now I feel quite confident with it. It covered most every aspect of the system from the very beginning (how the internet/networks work with domains, etc.). If you're managing a domain and/or virtual hosts, this is a great book."
5,This book changed my life,"It was somewhat dated even back in the eighties when I read it, but the principles that come across in the studies opened my eyes to things that I had never seen before. This book changed my awareness and thus my responses and actions in the world. I highly recommend it."
4,I Quit Smoking Marlboros,"A month without cigarettes! But I started again. Lasted a month! Took the first drag to the final track on this album (stupid I know but I couldnt take it anymore!) Pinball Mars by the Circus Devils is even more demented than Harold Pig and less accessible (sp?). YEAH! Brilliant nonetheless. Music like this makes me second guess everything else on offer. If you are even viewing this item, give up the movie rental cash or whatever other sundries you may think of rewarding yourself with and get this instead. Pop hooks however arent included."
3,a good re-working of the original series!,"While many of these stories come from the original series (having been re-worked during the writers strike), they're are enough updated components to the show to make it worth the money and time to watch! For example, one can see where the newer ""Tom Cruise"" style movie stuff came from by watching these... Digital era and all... The re-worked story lines from the ""original"" series have therefore been given new life. They're are even cameo appearances (besides the one from Phelps of course).My Advice: This DVD set was well worth the money and time to watch... but would buy on sale/used etc. As full price from Amazon... it was right on the edge of my value decision tree!"
4,Great Show But Terrible Transfer,"The original Mission Impossible was a great show and the 1988 revival of the show that lasted only two seasons was also great. The concept of taking the original star Peter Graves and surrounding him with a new young group of agents was brilliant. My only disappointment is the quality of the video transfer. It looks like the source material was a VHS, Super VHS, or 3/4"" copy. It is the worst quality I have ever seen for a major studio release of a network tv series. Either pristine source material has been lost or they just didn't care enough to take the effort to do this the right way. Very disappointing they didn't show more respect to this show when bringing it to DVD. I have the 1989 season ordered now and it is in transit. I am hoping it is better quality video transfer."
3,Excellent revival of an excellent series...but.,"There is no doubt this is a series revival every bit as good as the original sixties series. Great acting and stories makes it a must have for M:I fans. But, be aware of three unfortunate problems. 1. Like other reviews the video quality is not on par with the original series. 2. As noted on the back of the box in fine print: ""Some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"". And, 3. also in fine print on the back of the box: ""Music has been changed for this home entertainment version"". I've seen most of the eps on this collection and the stories are great and I saw no noticeable ""gaps"" or other problems because of any of the three issues listed, but you have to wonder why the original complete episodes couldn't be used."
3,"Good show, not so good transfer.","This is a great show, I remember watching it when I was in high school. Boy, Jim has aged, poor devil! :-) However, the video transfer is not very good. I was VERY disappointed in this production. The sound is great on my home system, but the video transfer for Hawaii Five-0, The Untouchables, and Wild, Wild West were MUCH clearer and better even though they are 20-30 years older! So it's good to have if you like the show, but be prepared for a picture that's a bit grainy if you have a big screen HDTV."
5,Very Entertaining,"While not the original Mission, still, an entertaining sequel. I have to admit that I love the original series, for all its faults, and it's great to see Mr. Phelps back with a new team to tackle the bad guys. The production values may not be as high, but, if you love Mission Impossible, you'll really enjoy this DVD. If any of your IM force are caught or killed the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions..."
2,Great idea...too much errata,"I bought this book thinking it would be a nice kick-start to ASP and Visual InterDev. I was wrong.If you don't have programing know-how the the consistant errata and lack of coding standards will cause you to not get past Day 1.The coding, which standards change from day to day, leaves out important details, chnages methods in doing the same tasks, and if you type it directly from the book, will cause your programs from Day 2 on to not work correctly.The amount of errata makes what could have been a good book a sub-standard one, and what is worse is that the Author only lists 2 errata on his website, when I found multiple errata throughout the book...at least 2-3 per 'day'.Stick with a WROX beginners book and you'll fair much better and save yourself some frustration.I've been programing for over 10 years, and without my previous knowledge, I would have never figured out the errors in the coding."
2,Great idea...too much errata,"I got this book thinking it would be a great start on ASP programing with Visual Interdev.Although I have learned alot, it has taken a lot longer due to, as other reviewers have pointed out, poor layout, poor coding (errata all over the place) and no coding standards. Each day seems like it was written by someone else as the coding is a little different each time.I recently got a WROX book on the same topic, and it's 100 times more organized.This book should have gone through the editing stage a few more times before being published.Someone with little programing know-how will be lost due to the errors, and the Author's site only points out 2 errata...after going through 5 days the only day I didn't have errata was day 1."
2,Hmmm... tad weak,"This is a very basic book indeed. If you are interested in how hard it would be to port the gui of an app from another OS to Be, this may help. But don't expect help on developing for Be much beyond an overview of the basic UI components. Heck, this doesn't even cover how to create your own components...just use the pre-defined ones. It's also a very short book, so it doesn't make for much of a reference.My vote is for you to use the BeBook online and grab what info you can from the mailing lists, chatrooms, and newsletters."
4,Good Be Programming Starting Point,"I normally don't bother writing online reviews, but I felt I should after seeing the previous review. I think the two star rating and criticism of the book is somewhat of a disservice to potential readers. I do agree with the reviewer that the book doesn't go in-depth. But I don't think it's supposed to. In the author's comments he uses words like ""fundamentals"" and ""overview"". He also says the book is a starting point, and a tutorial, and that programmers well-versed in Be programming should consider the two reference-style BeBooks by O'Reilly. So I don't think this book was really meant to cover things like custom controls (or even all of the existing controls). Anyway, it got me switched over from Windows programming, and that's what I wanted. I didn't really expect a tutorial to be the only book I'd need. (It's a good book, but I gave it four stars instead of five 'cause I don't know if I'd give *any* book a ""five""!)."
4,great book for those new to c++ or BeOS programming,"The title says it all. Take the authors advice. If your an advanced programmer go elsewhere, but if not (probably most of us) definitely use the book. I wrote my first simple Be program the same day I started reading the book. I can't imagine simpler explanations for what is a difficult subject."
5,Good guide to learning to program the BeOS,"I'd say this book is pretty much as the author describes it above -- it's great for getting started in programming for the BeOS. I come from a Windows programming background, and this book made the transition to Be programming smooth. It was a fairly quick read, and got me up to speed in writing simple Be apps. Now I'm digging in deeper with more advanced docs."
2,too small for bed!,"These sheets are very soft and have a nice design, but the queen size fitted sheet did not fit my queen size bed! And I don't even have a deep mattress. The sheet actually doesn't seem to be long enough. Two of the corners seems have split."
2,Misleading...,The picture shows pillow cases and another sheet but this only comes with 1 fitted sheet.
5,THESE WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS!,MY HUSBAND AND I THOUGHT THAT 'THE ADVENTURES OF OZZIE AND HARRIET' WAS CLASSIC 1950'S TV. IT WAS GREAT NOSTALGIA. WE LOVED THE COMERCIALS.
2,poor overview of the series,"""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" lasted for 14 years, but this dvd set includes only episodes from the final season -- surely it would be better to show the evolution of the characters over time. Ricky and David aren't even in most of the episodes, which involve an aging Ozzie bonding with neighborhood kids. The extras are a joke, 4 contemporary commercials, not necessarily the ones used during the episodes, and a biography of one paragraph. Even for a discount dvd, not worth the money."
2,Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet,"Ever since the invention of DVD, I've waited for someone to release this classic sitcom. Although I have many of the episodes on video tape the quality was usually very poor. When I saw that this great show was releashed on DVD I bought it right away. But I have to say that it has been a great disappointment.The quality of these two DVD's are the worst I've seen on DVD. The picture is at times blurred and there are skips in the sound. In one episode entitled, ""Kris And The Queen"" the sound is lost half way thru the show.Many of the original TV commericals have been included as a ""Bonus"" but the quality is so bad I could not even make out the picture on some. Although the episodes are classic Ozzie & Harriet, I can not give this set nothing more then a poor rating due to the quality of the disk.I hope someday someone will release a top quality addition to this great classic TV sitcom on DVD."
3,ozzie and harriet review,"I have purchased these dvd's a few years ago. I was very mad when i saw the price! i thought they would be good ! until i saw what company they werw from > (madacy). the picture and sound quality is very appaling and the episodes have been cut. Also< the commercials are not the originals from the show and the one of the commercials is wobbly through the whole thhing> please be aware when you buy these dvd's. Do me a favor:don""t buy them."
2,Ornella Muti is not nude in Forbidden Passion,"I was disappointed in Forbidden Passion. From the box cover, I expected to see a nude Ornella Muti. She keeps her interesting bits covered or off camera during this film. It is the story of a young girl hired as a secretary to her father's boss, becoming his mistress, and earning the family a better apartment and more money."
2,Arabian Prince bombs on his comeback CD...,"I got this CD not too long ago, I expected songs similar to the album 'Brother Arab', but Arabian Prince changed up his style. Now he used slow synthed strings, and more sexual lyrics then before. He found another rapper named Side Show to help back him up, probably because Arabian Prince wasn't use to this kind of rap style. The album had the gangsta beat with too much emphasis on b-tches and f----n. There are maybe three tracks that are enjoyable to listen to, but the other ones sound to repetitive or just too slow. The highlight of the album is the song ""Underworld"" when Arabian Prince brings back a fast tempo song about the ghetto. The best slow-synth song would be ""Ho's 2 Bozack"". A.Prince brings a lot of the NWA's production crew to make the album. I don't have the import version of this album, but i think there are maybe one or two bonus songs."
5,The true story of the discovery of Streptomycin.,"A poignant story about Dr. Albert Schatz, discoverer of streptomycin, who never received the recognition he deserved. The timing of the discovery meant the difference for survival for author Auerbacher, a survivor of a concentration camp. How these two lives intertwined is one the reader will never forget.It is written in a succinct manner for all the world to read and one book no one will ever forget.It is a story for all humanity and very insightful into the personalities of the two protagonists. It is easy enough for young adults to read as well as adults."
4,"Audiobook was good content, marginal audio","I listened to the audiobook version, and this review pertains to that. The material was pretty good, and the examples - like the airline industry and auto repair - bring lean into a perspective that every listener could understand and relate to. It was easy to see how lean methods could be applied - and also the examples went beyond the obvious to things like point to point private jet service, and redesign of planes to permit faster turn times, as examples tpo stretch the imagination.The audio, which was James Womack himself, was a little slow paced and done in a monotone. It was tough to keep my attention while listening in the car - and it wasn't because of the content. I've listened to some great audiobooks done by professional readers who can bring material to life - and would have recommended that these guys do the same thing next time. Womack is arguably the genius behind US lean thinking, but he's not well suited to be a recording artist..."
2,I was dissappointed,"I was expecting real life, in depth case studies. Instead I got a rather simplistic view of lean. A lot of the content in the book is real common sense. There is no doubt that lean processes are a must for the company. The book tends to spend 3/4 of its time trying to make that statement, with some high level strategic content thrown about.If you are expecting content such as how companies do VSM, and tactical challenges in doing VSMs you are reading the wrong book. But if you are interested in knowing what is a VSM, and high level overview of how VSMs are done, then this may be the book for you. ***DONT EXPECT TO BE IN A POSITION OF LEADING A LEAN INITIATIVE AFTER READING THIS BOOK***Good book for getting introduced to lean concepts. Not much for those looking beyond concepts."
5,AT LONG LAST!!!!!!!,"I taped this miniseries when it first aired on Masterpiece Theatre many years ago. I have replayed those tapes many times in the intervening years and wondered if and when the series would be available on DVD. Now, just before those tapes wear out, here it is! As Mr. Fetzer says in the synopsis, the acting is impeccable, the story draws your interest quickly and holds you through the entire 13 hours. This is a must for any DVD library. This is well worth the investment in money and time."
5,Fabulous!!,"This is a terrific mini-series from a book by one of my favorite authors, RF Delderfield. My husband has been a teacher for 40 years in an until-recently all boy boarding school. I made him watch the first night of this show when it originally aired on Masterpiece Theater back in the 80s and he got hooked. Now we both love the book and the mini-series, so this was a Christmas present this year. Highly recommend!!"
5,De lo mejor del maestro,"La poesía y locura del suicida Javier P Corcobado se conjugan en esta majestuosa obra llamada RITMO DE SANGRE. Sin duda es uno de sus mejores materiales, en los que las violentas letras nos transportan de un mundo de caos y locura (Quemaba Roma Neron) a otro totalmente opuesto, semejante a la calma después de la tormenta (De noche).Totalmente recomendado."
3,Paper Towel In A Box,"I wish I had read the description more thoroughly. The product description says ""White unbleached rags Cotton/cotton knit blend"" so I assumed this to be a box filled with scraps of cotton cloth(rags). This is a box filled with paper towel that has a texture of quilted toilet paper. If you are in need of shop paper towel you are better off going to Walmart and buying 2 ""Shop Towels On A Roll"" for $3.47 a piece which will come out to be 110 sheets for under $8 compared to buying rag in a box at $8.50 for only 85 sheets. If you are looking for actual cloth rags then this is not the product for you.I gave it 3 stars not because I was expecting cloth rags, I gave it 3 stars because the rags reap easily and for something call rags I expect it to be tougher.I have added pictures to compare these so called rags to regular paper towel."
2,"These are not ""rags""...","I always thought a rag was made of cloth. This is a box of very expensive paper towels, pre-cut. Waste of money. Get a roll of Bounty and you'll get the same result."
4,Mucha Lucha Ring,my youngest child like this since he watches the show on cartoon network.he also uses it for his other action figure men
3,Very informative,Very good book on how to cultivate Marijuana indoors.This book gives step by step details on how to grow and harvest Marijuana indoors.
1,needs circuits maps,a good book But Needs circuit maps for the lights in all five gardens to help the Beginners.
3,Not great for a new grower,"This book explores five different methods used by skilled growers. These book is best used if you already have some knowledge of growing and want to expand your operation using techniques that work. Be warned though, this book assumes that you are not a casual grower with one plant in your closet; all the methods cost well over $1000 to start up. However, if you are a grower looking for some good techniques, this is a nice book for you."
2,Cuts out both ends of the spectrum,"While this book dose have some good tips that i used, most of the information I allready know or could have found out without having to buy the book. And it is definatly not for the casual grower because the methods used here are for high end High yeild crops that are produced on a large scale. My advice is if your growing for profit you allready know these things, or if your going to grow for profit start off small and get your feet wet first before wasteing thousnads on equpiment. For casual growers there are some need to know tips but they can probabally be found in any of the more comprehensive for ""beginners"" books and will have the step by step walkthroughs that you need"
4,Good book for setting up grow area,"5 different gardens, from small to large, are profiled here. Many great ideas. Highly recommended."
1,Out of date,"There are still some sound principles in this book, but it's a decade old and you can get all of the same information but updated and in full color in Jorge's other books.Jorge should either update this book or take it out of print because there are a dozen other better books on growing, including his own.I returned this book after reading a few chapters..."
4,"""Live without a Net = No sweat !","I first came across Angel in 1980, about a year before the Superjam fest. at Busch Stadium in St.Louis. While going a little heavy on the glam & hair aspect, their sound had weight, there is a heavy aspect to the band. Frank Diminos vocal antics & Punky's screaming guitar prove to be more than adequate for the sound. However, it was the exceptional talent and ""Close Encounter"" with MOOG master Greg Giuffria that makes this standout performance a must for the 70's-80's rock & roll fan."
4,Rush is a rush,"Patric and Leigh are great as the undercover cops and their chemistry is great. Patric also plays an undercover cop later in 2002 in Narc with Ray Liotta and Busta Rhymes. Max Perlich(Drugstore Cowboy, Cliffhanger) does a great job as well. an addictive time"
5,the movie rush in VHS,"this movie came to me in perfect shape and very fast! I appreciate how quickly this transaction was done,very pleased with this whole thing!!"
5,gripping drama,I Thought This Movie Was Such A Great Movie. I Don't Like Most Drug Movies Because They Seem Really Dragged Out But Not This Movie. This Movie Was A Example Of What A Drug Movie Should Be. An Interesting Look Into How Bad Drugs Can Be And Two Cops. This Movie Is Really Sad But I Loved It. My Favorite Thing About This Movie Is That It Was Based On A True Story And It Has One Of Eric Claptons Greatest Songs On The Soundtrack.
1,wrong language,The movie was not in english. The movie would of been great if was in english. This movie would not play in my dvd player. It said it would not play in this region.
3,"It was okay, but........","I thought the movie was okay, but it wasn't quite accurate. In the novel, you understand the struggles she (Kristen) goes through because you have a since of her history, the way she grew up and the morals she had. In the movie we see no trace of this, and in my opinion it would have been much better to develop this area for the viewers."
4,Awesome movie!,"This is not an action packed movie. But it more than makes up for it. It is about a couple of narcotics detectives who get strung out. Very good. Very similar to NARC, which jason patric is also starring in."
4,"""ain't nothin' to it but to do it....""","I think Special K. McCray steals this movie. He's only in one scene, but he is just so good(and real)(and sleazy) as Willie Red the drug dealer. Max Perlic is also perfectly cast. The rest of the actors are superb,but check out Gregg Allman as the alleged big bad drug kingpin. Great music throughout (Eric Clapton score plus a few rock and blues classics). Great storylines. Well done. Check this movie out!!"
5,Rush is Best Damn Drug Film Ever,You must see if you grew up in the late 70's & 80's. So realistic it is scary.
2,dvd case damaged,"The dvd was supposed to be in good as new condition, but when I received the dvd, the case looked like it had been in water. The case was in very bad shape. The dvd itself worked fine."
5,"AMAZING, PATRIC IS TO DIE FOR",The movie was just that a .....Rush. I really liked the movie. I thought Patrick played the part to a T. She was really good also . I was a little sad about the end.
4,Abrupt,It's an interesting story but the ending is abrupt. It's as if Andre Norton got bored writing it and decided to stop. No explanation is given for what happened to the two protagonists. Nor is any explanation given as to if the strange things will continue or if they have stopped.
2,Should have stayed a whisper,This doco isn't authorised by the band. It's actually really boring and the lack of music from LP is really noticeable. Disappointed with this purchase.
1,boring,I am a confirmed obsessive Linkin Park fan. I personally found this a bit boring. This is unauthorized so it did not have enough of the band contributing to the project.
2,ok for first time fans,If you just trying to know the band for the first time. ok. But you are better off with the Linkin Park product from the Band or Label itself.
3,Nice idea but....,".... it seemed a little runny and I had to do a number of coats to get a decent cover. May try the non-spray kind next time. End result was as expected though, just a runny messy application. Applies like spray paint."
5,"it's Plasti-dip, in white","I used this stuff to change the color of my car emblems,, like how people do with the black. Didn't wasn't black, because Camrys come with black badge nowadays. Just sprayed onto emblem, and peel away from sections you don't want it (paint)."
1,not that good,runny and does not stick to any type of wire I tried it on even though I followed directoins. Stick with colored tape.
4,Very good collection...,"This is a very good Cyndi Lauper collection... one of the most complete today. However, they have left out her newer songs such as ""Shine"" and ""It's Hard To Be Me"". This 3 disk set has some pretty rare tracks on it, plus a few second version tracks."
2,I love Cyndi Lauper,"An amazing talent, unrivaled. Well, that's my opinion. The less than stellar review is for the package, not the music.Three CDs in a double CD case I haven't seen since the mid 80s. I thought these CD cases were extinct! Very cheap!There is NO CD book included. All we get is three CDs and a list of tracks. It might as well be a CD-R burned in someone's basement.That being said, there are a few gems that I didn't previously own; this is a good thing. Thanks to the miserable packaging, however, for songs that are new to me I know nothing more than their title. I have no clue when they were recorded or where they first appeared (on the B side of this or that, etc.).For [the price] I think someone somewhere could have put some effort into creating a nice CD package. Cyndi deserves better. When the CD arrived, I was VERY disappointed.No matter what... nothing will ever change the bottom line - I love Cyndi Lauper."
1,Incomplete,"I felt that as far as I got, 30+ pages, the book appeared to be well written. However in the process of going through the installation I encountered a ""PARTATION NOT LINUX NATIVE FORMATTED"" notice. So I started over again and encountered the same thing. I then took some time and went through the index, table of contents and paged through each chapter and to no avail did I encounter anything on ""LINUX NATIVE FORMATTING"". So I started the installation over again. Same problem. I stopped and went out and bought a different book. In short it was a waste of $ + tax and my time. Aside from this major roadblock, the writing is very clear and concise. I wish all technical books were written with this clearity and format."
3,What can I say it is what it is a thermometer.,"For crine out loud it is an outdoor thermometer it might be tough to get 75 word in on it. It's round and white tough to see at night perhaps it would be better with a light. In the light of day it's ok. It reads the temp of the air I say.If your still reading this I'd be surprised, but 300 words is alot. It reads the temp of the day and night but easier to see with a light. Maybe I'll buy a light. Goodnight."
4,Outdoor thermometer,"The Thermometer itself seems to be a good product, but there was no protective packaging in the box; therefore the thermometer arrived with a broken piece (which fortunately my husband was able to superglue back on)."
4,Perfect for the Spot,"Just what I was looking for to hang outside my window...big and bold and visible and not expensive at all. And as a bonus you can see it from other parts of the house as well. The only reason I rated it 4 stars and not five was the thermometer has yet to go through a winter. We have a massive windstorm hitting tonight, and we'll see whether it stays up or not. At least it has two anchor points."
3,Screws not included,"I haven't been able to put it up because it doesn't come with the screws required. It is printed what size you need to buy. It seems to register hotter than the actual temperature. It is very flimsy and wonder if it will blow away at the first breeze. I don't know when I'll get it installed, so far I'm disappointed in the quality, and would return it but that is more trouble than its worth."
1,Doesn't go below 40 degrees; inaccurate,"Well I guess the quality of these is hit-and-miss, because the one I bought at a local L home improvement store does not register temperatures below 40. There is frost all over the grass, birdfeeders, cars, etc, and our other 2 thermometers read 31 degrees, but this one still says 40. This thermometer has not dropped below 40 degrees once this whole winter."
1,Thermometer doesn't work but Amazon does!,"This thermometer didn't work. Like another reviewer wrote - it stays at 40-45 degrees all the time. I wish I could give the product a zero but Amazon 5 stars! The refund/return was so easy and Amazon even provides the shipping label so I don't have to pay to return it. I got free super saver shipping to begin with so I'm out $0. This is why Amazon rocks and I am a frequent customer. I rarely have any issues with AMazon purchases. I am a loyal customer because I know that when there is an issue, they make it right."
1,What a rip-off!,"This is the cheapest looking item I have ever bought from any store whatsoever. It must have cost 50 cents to mass produce. There is no back on the thermometer, so nothing protects the spring for the needle gauge. I cannot see it lasting longer than a New York Minute."
5,Good Thermometer,"Hangs easily, easy to read, seems accurate. What more could you ask for in a wall thermometer. I'm very pleased"
4,Thermometer,"This is what I expected, I have used these thermometers before and it is just as the others in the past. However you do have to be careful where these are placed due to the strength of the plastic. They can crack easily. We keep it in an area where it won't be hit with too many storms.Thank you..."
4,Springfield out door thermometer,Large numbers that are easy to read. Seems durable enough to hold up the weather. I would recomend this .
4,No frills but does its job,"I ordered this to hang outside and be visible from the kitchen window and it's perfect for that. The big face makes it totally legible from afar, even the temperatures in celsius, so that's a plus. It's a no-frills model, but that's perfect for what I was wanting. There is no back plate/cover on the thermometer so I am hoping that it weathers well, but that remains to be seen!"
2,You need to work with this for accuracy,"I guess this makes sense if you want to look and have a number. Easy to read dial. It is ""lightweight"" so it is shaky to secured and the bimetal spring is not protected .I have had to move it from the place for where I wanted it to a place that was my 3rd star choice for accuracy. I have to say it is a fluff piece if you work off the temp. I have had it out there for 6 months in New England weather and it has survived it's first winter. So I added a star."
1,Buy something decent instead,"Don't waste your money. Its not accurate and if it was, its too cheaply made to last. I guess its worth the 10.00 I paid so you get what you pay for."
5,It Works !!,I have been purchasing the Velco wristband watches for years at the military exchanges. they are harder to find so I went to Amazon.Com -- BINGO they had a nice choice and the one I bought is my best looking one yet.
1,usefullness,This product is totally useless. It was 120 deg reading when I took it out of the box and hasnt budged since (local temp. is 72 deg.) They dont even provide a way to hang it which is ok since I threw it in the garbage anyway.
3,EASY to read but inaccurate temps,"I was very happy to get this thermometer 1 year ago, seeing how easy it is to read from a distance!I mounted it in the carport (always shaded) inches away from an electronic temp sensor that's used by my atomic wall clock. (verified accurate). This thermometer by comparison is always off by 3-5 degrees.Simply put: easy to read but inaccurate. End of story."
1,Cheap and inaccurate,"I bought this large outdoor themometer because it had graduaions for temperatures that can be seen from a distance. I mounted it approximately 75-80 away on the outside of a wood shed in an area not in direct sunlight. I read the reviews before I purchased it, some were good, some bad, so I took a chance. It is cheaply made, doubt if it will last one season of cold and hot temps, but the worst is that it was reading 6 degrees higher than the acutal temp. I put a smaller outdoor themometer, bulb style, which i knew to be accurate. I have been able to twist the metal coil in back and got it down to 4 degree lower, twisted it again to read the same temp as the smaller guage. Don't know if this will work, but worth a try. Recommendations, keep looking for a better build and more accurate themometer."
1,Not an accurate thermometer.,Nice large numbers = yes. Easy to read from a distance = yes. Accurate = NO. It is off from 4 to 10 degrees or more and there is no way to adjust it.
5,"Great value, easy to read","This was exactly what I was looking for - large numerals, easy to read from our sliding doors out to the patio. Could not find anything comparable locally. Very fast,reasonable shipping, too."
3,It's a POS...but it's CHEAP!,"IF they showed a back view of this ""El Cheapo,"" NObody would buy it. But if you want a BIG thermometer that will ""accurately"" tell you the temperature within five or six degrees in either direction, this is a BARGAIN!"
2,Disappointed,I ordered this thermometer as a gift for my mom and didn't even give it too her. It felt flimsy and cheap.
4,A Pretty Good Collection,"I enjoyed this boxed collection of rock appearances by different groups, mostly in the 60s with a few 50s appearances. I was a little annoyed that some of the songs appeared on more than one disk, so there are repeated songs. Still, there are several disks worth of music, with quite a cross section of artists. Motown is strongly represented here and if you like that music, you'll love this collection. There is a disk devoted to the British invasion artists also. I would have liked to see more of the Beatles appearances; the only one I saw was the initial one. Overall a fine collection, but it could have been a bit better."
4,Good Set,"I love the Ed Sullivan Show, and these DVDs bring you the greatest rock acts of all time - all in one place! In this excellent 9-DVD package, you will find Elvis, the Beatles, the Doors, the Rolling Stones and many more. Yes, some songs repeat throughout the set, and yes, the discs are a little too short, but I'm willing to overlook that and enjoy my favorite rock acts again and again. Now it's your turn."
1,Not worth the money.,"While this is a nicely packaged set the contents are disappointing. Sure, you get a 144 performances but they are edited. For the price I was expecting the complete performance by an artist. And it's not because of lack of space on the DVD. I also question the choices of artists/songs or artists omitted. Do we really need two songs by Dino, Desi and Billy? What about the Dave Clark Five? A group so well liked by Ed Sullivan that they had an open invitation to appear on his show. Why were they absent from the British Invasion discs? As Herman's Hermits once sang, this is ""A Must To Avoid""."
1,buyer beware,"just wanted to chime in here and say that this box really is a tremendous [disappointment]. steer clear of it. as mentioned the performances are heavily edited. i thought the beatles had deliberately omitted the solo on ""from me to you"" until i looked at the same performance on the ""first visit"" dvd. there it was. total misrepresentation. really a disservice to the artists and to the consumer. if that's not enough the whole thing is ridiculously arranged with an annoying theme played throughout. and as everyone's mentioned you're paying for 9 discs when you should be paying for 4 or 5. by all means pass on this box."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"Save your money!!! Have the 12 DVD set Rock n' Roll Classics Complete Collection. Performances are shortened versions of full songs. Performances are clipped! Some videos start immediately without any intro and end before the last notes of the song are completed. Some performances are duplicated. Video quality sucks in some performances and should have been digitally remastered. All video is in 4:3 aspect ratio as expected. Audio is mono, but sounds OK. All performances could probably fit on 6-8 DVDs instead of 12. Rhino / Sofa Entertainment blew it on this one. Too expensive at $149."
2,IT'S JUST OK !!!,"The reviews on this box seem to vary from great to rotten. Yes, I agree that it's got some value due to its historic content. But make no mistake, these performances are chopped. The thing that burns me up, is that its not just long jams that are cut, but very short songs also. To end all confusion with artists doing shortened versions on purpose, I ask you to view the DVD of The Beatles: First U.S. Visit. Compare the same songs, played on the same night back in 1964. This is a dececptive product that tries to fool the unsuspecting buyer. It took me several viewings to figure it out. Shame on you Rhino!!!"
3,Just ice cube trays with lids,"Well, I had found another product called Slimlines online, but I was making a large order with Amazon and thought I would just get these instead of ordering of off the Slimlines site. I REALLY liked the Slimlines because instead of cube shaped one ounces, they freeze the milk into thin stick-like shapes, perfect for dropping in the bottle (hence the name). Still, these trays work fine, but are just glorified ice cube trays LOL."
5,Simple but it works,There isn't much to this but it works well. The Sprinkler gauge is surprisingly very useful as it helps calibrate irrigation systems.
3,"measures rain, but don't break it","This is a fairly fragile item. Yank it, pull it wrong and it breaks, but leave it be and treat it nicely and it does the job. The rain gauge can be easy to let be, the lawn sprinkler is handy and even more prone to breakage since you may move it, be careful sticking it in to the ground. Be careful and both will last, but note they easily break. For the price, I'd say a bargain."
4,Good for reference not for reading,"It says it covers the 2D and 3D APIs. However, as near as I can tell, it covers the Java 2D API in much detail. Then it covers how to do 3D using the 2D API, but never covers the 3D API directly. This is still useful because any 3D API will make certain tradeoffs and if the tradeoffs don't match your needs, you might have to implement your own 3D API using the 2D API.The book is very heavy on code examples. Each section seems to have an introduction, a code example, and then commentary on the code example. However, I think the book would be better with more text to go with the code.While I don't think the strength of this book is the cover-to-cover readability, I think it is an excellent reference resource. If you are trying to do a particular graphical task, you can just look it up and there will be a code example there waiting for you, which is enormously useful."
3,This book is very basic...,I made a mistake buying Graphics Programming with JFC ... the book is not bad but it's extremely superficial.If you need something more deep than opening an Image File you should look for something different (I haven't found yet...).
5,Probably the best,"Out of all forms of books on spirituality this one is probably the best. Really. Nothing here that will put you off. And yet this is the essential spiritual advise ever, both for young and old."
2,rip off,I found this at a local store for half the price. Wish I would have done more research before I bought it. Totaly my fault. The dish is nice the bird not so much. Also was suprised to see it was made in China.
3,Saw the movie again after 17 years,Saw the movie again today. I did enjoy how the stories intersected. No matter what you think we are not islands. We do influence each other for good or for bad. I am not used to R rated movies anymore so the F-bombs and profanity was very offputting. The thing that I can reccomend without reservation is the soundtrack. It was still as awesome to the story as I remember. Put that on your i-pod and crank up the Bose speakers. Phenonmenal!
2,Pretty depressing,"After I had seen this movie in the cinema, I got home, and my roommate was doing some paperwork. I sat down in his lazy chair.After several minutes, he asked me: ""So what you been doing?""I answered: ""I've been to see Grand Canyon.""He said: ""Ah. That is why you're so quiet.""Indeed.This movie tries to be about the horrors of life, and to be somehow uplifting at the same time. But due to the fact that it *shows* nothing uplifting whatsoever, it completely fails, for me anyway. It was just depressing."
1,I want those two hours of my life back.,"I saw this movie in the theatre with some friends when it first came out. We barely made it through this train wreck without walking out. I immediately considered it to be among the worst movies I'd ever seen. How gratifying to see that many professional critics had the same sentiments. Long, boring, pretentious, PC, etc., etc. A torturous waste of time."
1,A terrible movie all around,"The acting: grim.The storyline: sad.The characters: disgusting.In short, there was nothing anyone could possibly like about this movie. The moral of the story is no matter how many well respected actors appear in a movie, it cannot save it from bad writing and direction."
3,I don't get it,"Ok, Maybe I'm retarded, but I don't get this movie. It should be an awesome movie (by looking at the actors and the director) but this movie is just boring. I hate the girl that Kevin Kline tries to go after. She's a crummy actor... The one highlight of this movie, is the great Steve Martin. Once the movie is over, you wonder, ""Why wasn't Steve Martin in tha movie more?"" He's the only reason I gave it a 3! Viewers beware...this movie is boring."
1,Complete Boredom.,"This movie consists of a bunch of unrelated tragedies in Los Angeles, having nothing at all to do with the Grand Canyon.The dialog consists of people exchanging meaningless comments at cross purposes. Nothing happens. Nothing is decided.Steve Martin is totally miscast in trying to be a serious character.he is better off just standing in front of a tv camera and telling jokes.It seemed as if this movie took about 12 hours.There is no observable plot.After a while the screen says ""The End."""
1,Are you having trouble with your sleep? Rent this one...,"Obvioulsy, everybody involved in this project thought they were making a masterpiece. They didn't. The result is one of the most boring movies ever made, irritantingly slow, trying to be ""great"", ""give a message"", but is so obvious it made me sick!"
5,"""I Reject Your Grand Canyon Headache""","Well, the elitists and hopeful intellectuals have certainly coughed up a throatful of diatribes aimed at this Lawrence Kasdan creation. While I won't deny that is has some pretense and is too long, I can't help but return to it again and again (yes, it's one of my favorites - bullocks to you, elitists) for its crystal clear portrayal of a short, troubled period of American life in paradise-lost Los Angeles. The actors soar individually and as an ensemble. The editing is sublime. I understand Kasdan's morality play isn't for everyone, but to dismiss this film as one of the worst...please. I reject your headache. And by the way, I also found Mary McDonnell through this film, and what a worthwhile find she was. Hollywood has seriously underestimated and undervalued this wonderful actress."
4,good film,it was a good film in that it explored the Live's of different people and the things that they were going thru.it's a good solid cast.i enjoyed watching the Laker shots.that alone seems like a time far ago.good directing&Chemistry.
5,Still one of the best movies........................,I have watched this movie several times in the past and yet every time I see it I notice something that was prominent yet missed the previous time. The whole thing can be summed up in that our oh so busy lives are nothing as compared to the Grand Canyon.
3,Not my favourite read....,"It took a lot of pages to give the moral of the story, which is found in 1 Timothy 6:10 - For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."
4,Not a Bad Reference,I thought this book walked through some of the more obscure configuration issues of RH 6.1 pretty well. I liked the fact they actually had screenshots of the installation and I really liked the chapter on compiling the kernel.
2,Poor Installation Guide,I was really disappointed with this book. Every step of the way I had to refer to some other book or to the internet for resources. I found it to be very unclear as well as not very thorough...
1,Small little booklet,"It was not indicated in the description that this was a very small 5""x5"" book. Very disappointed and gave it away."
2,Not impressed.,"Not impressed with this recipie book at all. The recipies did not appeal to me, I made one thing out of it, and it didn't turn out how I thought it would."
3,Christmas Gift,"My Granddaughter had asked for a Rachel Ray Cookbook for her Christmas Gift so I used Amazon to do my Christmas Shopping. I talked to her this morning and she said she was very happy with the book. So, again, Thank you for helping me with my Christmas Shopping. Being 84 years old I don't care to go out much so I thank you for your help. Thanks, Katy"
4,"Wonderful, but it's small","This cookbook was purchased for a gift, I think my aunt will love it! But for your knowledge, the book is small, not a normal sized cookbook. More like 5x5 size."
2,"No, No, Not worth it!","The mop head has to be replaced after one mopping of a floor and tears easily. EVERY SINGLE REVIEW has been bad, which should tell you something. Finally, if you are considering the Mr Clean Magic Eraser mop, same issues. Don't bother.I love the Magic Erasers, which you use to clean walls, so I had high hopes for this product as well. But it just isn't worth the money or storage space!"
1,a real piece of junk,"This is the worst mop I have ever owned! I really expected better. Now I understand why the replacement sponges were in the closeout store. They are wonderful, if they would just stay on the handle. I contacted the manufacturer and the replacement mop they provided is just as bad. The replacement is not cellulose sponge and does not clean the floor. I give up on Mr Clean mop products."
2,Psychology of Winning....,"Was not too keen about some of it. Personally, I thought it could stand some improvement.Counselor Counselet"
3,Outdated,Conceptually it's based on good principles but the analogies are at least 20 years old. It would be better if updated for today's world.
4,Very Enlightening,A must for your collection of self help cd's/tapes. He is very motivating with his reasonable explanations of how to get somewhere in life. I highly recommend this to be heard more many times as needed for motivation.
2,Too Much RA RA and Not Enough Substance,"Enjoying tapes, especially on self improvement, has become a part of my daily commute. I have become more critical of their content in the process. This is my second audio tape from this author and I must admit that he is among my least favorites.Mr Waitley stlye is similar to that of a football coach with too many 'one liners' we have all heard while someone humms 'America the Beautiful' in the background. It became irritating and difficult to maintain attention to his words. He is also too wordy to get his point across.I am sure there are people who appreciate this man's style and may find him dynamic. I found him less knowledgable and making up for it with his cheerleading analogies.I won't buy any more of his tapes. I prefer Brian Tracy for the same subject matter."
2,Outdated Book That Never Gets To The Point,"This 1970's book is a low quality printing. Many of the ideas stated are out of date, and since proven inferior.Rather than discuss winning psychology, the book drones on about the difference between races, and ethnic backgrounds, etc.Definitely not up to the caliber of other books in the genre."
1,The Psychology of Winning,"Your ad made it look like I was purchasing the actual book, The Psychology of Winning.What you sent me was some cheap workbook that was of absolutely NO use to me. I was extremely disappointed"
5,Excellent All the Way!,"Dr. Waitley builds his theme around an ancient truth that is undeniable, ""as a man thinketh in his heart, so is he."" It's undeniable because it's from the Bible, God's Word. As a good scholar/teacher, Dr. Waitley expands upon this truth, helping us to see it from different angles.Different illustrations and research findings are used as he builds his case in a solid manner. My copy of this excellent book is well-marked. He doesn't just describe the principle, he includes the ""how to do it"" component. This book is all any motivational book could hope to be. It tells the truth in a way that makes you want to act on it."
2,Could not read,"I could not even read this book, it was too boring, but I imagine it was a very good read for people who enjoy reading..."
5,to Canada,"Mr. Canada you said you liked Bob Marley then stick to those kind of music because they are out there. Sizzla, Beres Hammond, Capleton and so on. Elephant Man is a dancehall artist and what he says does make sense you just can't understand it. Do me a favor don't buy anymore dancehall music. And the name Elephant man came from what he's packin its like the elephant trunk think about it. This cd was bomb I suggest everyone buys it and I'm not a big dancehall fan"
5,Good 2 Go,"I love dancehall, i love Ele, i love this cd!! You can't listen to it and not get up and cock up your bumper just a little bit!! I make it a mission to learn the dances to all of Ele's songs....he has definately brought back the DANCE in dancehall. Ele, you're my fav reggae artist keep doin ya thing. And hurry up and come back to Tampa!! One Love."
1,anoying,"My Friend bought Elephant mans album and was very dissapointed,his voice is very very very anoying. he needs to learn how to speak before he makes a record, i dont understand one thing he is saying. The only things hot on the ablum are the beats. OUT"
4,"Re: anoying, December 5, 2003 by faith, USA","Dear Faith,British speak english, Jamaicans speak jamaican. Spend a moment outside of your Ameri-centric world, and you will understand."
3,different tracks on different CDs,"Having Ele's 3 other albums i dont rate this one as good as the rest.The album is good but i felt it lacked a few tracks that should have been on there.The album didnt contain:Badman Christmas(sorry to the world that made me rise me gun) or JAMAICA. Im from england and JAMAICA, f**k you sign and another track were not on the album but on this track listing on amazon they are. Is this correct or a miss print.Can someone let me know."
3,"alright, for a budget","This is a very extensive anthology of their Sony years (four albums, plus b-sides), but be warned: this is very much a budget release! There is no inlay card, and virtually no real info, and the sound is dodgy. Unfortunately, this is the best collection out there as of now, along with ""Collection"", a single-disc comp of the years before Sony, but that one is a budget as well!!"
3,"Good, but not great OP","While this is a good album from my favorite OP trio - with Ray Brown and Ed Thigpen - there is less than 40 minutes of music, and there really are no memorable tunes. It certainly does not compare favorably with Night Train, Jazz Soul/Affinity, Peterson Plays Basie, and several other Oscar Peterson Trio CD's. I would buy this, but not until adding some of the others to an Oscar Peterson collection."
4,bottom,"Brilliant family entertainment. I have all of the series now, they are so funny. They don't have to try either, the charictars have so much spark, it's well written and hilarious. I love all of them. Happy to recommend."
2,Sills only good as Olympia,"Sill's coloratura is very good. And her voice is ideal as Olympia. But she is totally unsuited to sing the other heroines. Her voice is too small and shrill to do them justice. It is the microphone that has made her an idol. One star is for her technique, the other star is for her fine acting."
4,Good reference for ppl with music knowledge..not for dummies,"I have some basic knowledge on Indian classical music. I wanted to learn Electronic Keyboard and hence chose the dummies book. The first few pages were great to learn the basics. Once I crossed chapter 4 I was lost. The important thing I wanted to know was the fingerings. There is no mentioning of extending the fingerings from the basic position. I would rather prefer a lesson & practice approach. When it comes to Music (instruments), the approach must be ""build one block over other"". Precisely a strong foundation. The Author must emphasise more on practice sessions and most importantly the recommended No. of hours for an average beginner to get hold of the piece. I am sure the book will be really useful if I know the basics of (piano) music or if I'm a student in a music school. Last word, very nice to learn basics, misses important aspect....Fingerings...."
4,It's a Very Clear Little Book,"If you hate the title, I understand. I do too! But the bottom line is that it really is a good intro book for an adult.If you really don't have a clue why flats and sharps have two different names, but are really the same key, this book explains all.In reality, I am using the book to teach my children. I read, get the concept then translate.Worth the money."
4,Typical Dummies manual for piano,"This book was a lot of fun to begin with, but I found the author's terse, supposedly humorous comments tedious after a while. The piano instruction portions are sound, however, and the CD provides a lot of jazzed up guidance and hints without being too overbearing. I'm not real sure that a pure beginner could learn to play from this book, but an advanced beginner to intermediate student would surely glean some useful hints from this book and have fun while doing so. I loved the author's section on how to improvise and improve a song ending. All in all, useful."
4,Good beginner book,"Good info, but you may still need lessons.It is well written and helped to understand playing, but you may still need lessons."
4,Helpful enough...,"Helpful enough for a beginner. Not only including step-by-step learning methods about reading and playing music, but also providing some background information such as how to chose a piano."
5,One heck of a helpful book!,"One of my biggest dreams is to be able to play the piano. About 80% of my family can already do so, but no one ever had the time or the patience to teach me. Now I'm well on my way to fulfilling my dream with a little help with this funny and easy to understand book. I love it. I also enjoy playing along with the CD it comes with."
3,Lacking exercises.,"The two problems with the book are the lack of exercises and not setting a time frame for the available ones. It's divided into chapters and theories just follow eachother. The author doesn't stop and tell you to start practicing a certain piece, for how long and what else you can do."
1,A Total Waste of Money,"I wish they had a zero star rating, but I was forced to give at least one star. This book is overly lengthy, boring, condescending, and not even appropriate for a five year old. I wish I could send mine back."
2,Look elsewhere.,"Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here."
2,Awful CD,"The book is an okay way to learn about the piano - but I would go with the Idiot's Guide to Music Theory or the zillion other books on music theory. The CD that comes with the book (along with the examples IN the book) are no more complex than the built-in songs that come with most low-end keyboards. IN FACT, most of the songs sound like they've been produced by some $39 Casio keyboard made in 1987. I would look for books that teach theory and back them up with longer and more complex classical pieces or at least better produced music. You'll come away with knowing more than ""Little Brown Jug""."
1,Who's the Dummy?,"I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).I wish I had not bothered and kept my 14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.IMO this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good ""easy books"" on teaching beginners the piano."

1,defective,"I ordered the smoker for my son for Christmas, when he tried to use it the lid was too little and just fell down in the smoker. I sent it back and recieved a refund."
3,"Good value, but seriously...","This smoker is the bargin member of the smoker family. For the money it's a good starter unit. Don't buy it if you plan on getting serious about cooking with smoke. We found it effective, but labor intensive to maintain a temperature for longer smokes. It produced great smoked salmon filets in less than 2hrs but on the turkeys and ribs, it was a lot of work. If you're handy, you can modify it as suggested in another review. We ended up with a Brinkman All-in-One gas unit and wouldn't trade it for anything. It's a 160k btu burner for deep frying birds or boiling lobster. It grills, charcoal or gas. It smokes, charcoal or gas. It has vents to get air inside the charcoal pan. We mounted a professional grade themometer in the lid and with gas, can maintain smoker/bbq temps between 150 and 300+ indefinetly."
2,Poor construction,"We purchased this item and saw great uses. However, just getting it out of the box indicated a problem. The base unit was out of round and I struggled to get the top packaged in it out. The top was perfectly round and the base could never be ""squeezed"" just right to allow a proper fit. There was always a gap of at least 3/8"" on one side. I took it back to the store and because of my time putting it together, they offered me an upgrade for the same price. Same problem on two more so I said forget it got a refund. Poor workmanship and quality control."
3,Must keep close watch on smoker,"I purchased this charcoal smoker, because I could not find an electrical one. I had used an electric one for years, but found my old one had rusted out. With company coming for the weekend and summer heat upon us, I opted for the charcoal smoker.I found it was hard to keep the heat control in the proper cooking range. I had to keep adding charcoal and still could not get the proper temperature for my food. The smoke was working but the charcoal did not heat up enough. I waited four hours and then had to finish the food in my oven. There was to much uneven heat as compared to an electric smoker, which I could just plug in and leave. This way I was tied up to this charcoal smoker and could not enjoy my family while food was cooking.I did love the red color, but when it comes to the finished product it was not a plus. I will continue to look for an electric smoker."
4,Smokalicious!,"You will love the way food can taste when cooked on this adorable (yet quite sizable) red smoker. Remember to make your pitcher of margaritas early because it can take a while before the charcoal heats up enough to slow cook the food. Hence it is best for an all day/night event, not a quick meal. Don't be afraid to get creative with the food you smoke (fruit and veg are just as good as seafood and meats!) It's fairly easy to clean as well. Enjoy."
1,Not functional as is.,"I purchased this smoker a year ago, to start cooking out some ribs for a family gathering. I had a long time ago the electric version of this cooker, and since getting into charcoal with my grill -- thought that I might as well go Charcoal with the smoker as well (Charcoal + Wood is a heck of a lot of fun for me).Well, this thing could not keep temps up no matter what. The ash would choke out the fire, and I was constantly tending it. The end result was fine -- it just was a TON of work! Threw it out a few months ago, and got a Weber Bullet Smoker.I'm running it now, and it has been maintaining a temperature of 235 degrees (+/- 5 degrees) for the last 4 hours! It's a bit more expensive ($200 compared to $35) but if you want something that will last you and you can afford it, I completely recommend that smoker."
2,"It does work, just not very well...","I actually didnt purchase this smoker, luckily, but I borrowed it from a friend to try out. I've had about 10 successful smokes on it, but it is not as easy as it should be. In order to even get the thermometer to read in the ideal range, I've found that not filling the water pan at all is the key. Otherwise it gets stuck on the cool/ideal line. My smokes have taken 3-4 hours longer then expected due to the ashes choking the fire out. I would have to stir the coals and knock ash off every 30 min to retain a decent temperature. As soon as I have the money, I will buy the Weber Smokey Mountain and give this smoker back to my friend."
2,Tasty and cheap,"Pros: Cheap smoker, easy to modify, tasty bbq, good first-time smoker purchase, capacity feeds 10 peopleCons: Needs modification (drilling holes) for air flow, need to keep an eye on it b/c it doesn't hold a steady temp."
3,Modifications,"I just bought the Char Broil smoker. Looks like a great unit, but based on all the other reviews I have concerns about maintaining temperature. I read Chris Cox's suggested modifications to the smoker pan, but I don't understand his need for an additional grate. Did he put it in the pan and put the coals on top of the grate to increase airflow? I'm smoking next week and will further review, but if Chris or anybody can answer my queation, please email me: wlaino@moritthock.com. Thanks."
1,"once burned, twice shy!","Yes the price was right, and the color was glorious, there's just one problem...the unit is built like a piece of ****!I have been through two units, and each arrived with a warped body, a lid that was not a fit for the body, and rivets and seams that were not sealed. Amazon was great returning the first unit, but TWO with the same issues? You do get what you pay for."
2,You Get What You Pay For...,"The problem with this smoker is that it is very difficult to achieve and maintain a high enough temperature to hot smoke foods. After I performed the usual modifications it worked better, but it was still no great shakes. That said, it works pretty well for cold smoking (below 150 degrees). So if your main focus is curing bacon or pastrami say, this will probably be serviceable and I've gotten a lot of use out of mine in that application. But I think most people would be better served by skipping this product and getting a higher quality unit."
1,Poor design,"This smoker is impossible to add fuel to once the water pan is in place, so maintaining sufficient heat is also impossible. Also, no ""user"" manual came with the smoker, so it takes a lot of experimenting for a new user to figure out how to use it."
1,Fundamentally defective,"I agree with most of the criticisms already stated. It is literally impossible to add additional coals. Also, the grate/water pan supports are garbage -- difficult to place the bowl with the fire hot, and then it will frequently tip. Maybe my technique isnt perfect, but I have had only two successful uses of this thing. I may make additional changes, e.g. removing one grate and mounting the water bowl higher. Maybe that will open up an area to load coals more easily. In addition, my father has a two-piece smoker that lifts to add the coals -- FAR better for the same price. AVOID this smoker, IMO."
4,Get the other one,"Too LA for me - I like the original east coast CD. It's here where the real Mulberry St is. Find the B&W Gutterboy and cherish it forever. The best ""undiscovered group"" of all time. Take FOLK + AC DC and add a touch or DEL LORDS & you got Gutterboy. The guys ( and girl ) make us Astorians proud !"
4,"Surreal - a la ""Memento""","In all candor, I purchased this dvd because I am so intrigued by Roy Dupuis in the La Femme Nikita series. I had read about his popularity and status in Canada; when I heard about this new release and the critical acclaim it received, curiosity overwhelmed me. This is not a conventional, traditional plot driven movie. I don't say that by way of criticism but rather to inform. One has to pay close attention to keep track of what is going on and even then it's purposefully confusing, much like ""Memento."" At the end of the movie I had any number of unanswered questions. That's not always a bad thing--that a movie causes you to think and wonder is sometimes the hallmark of a good film. I enjoyed Dupuis' performance. If you get the chance, I recommend this movie. Just don't expect the expected or you will be disappointed."
4,LOOKING FOR ALEXANDER,"I LIKED THIS MOVIE. I THOUGHT ROY DUPUIS PERFORMANCE WAS GREAT. HE CAN SAY SO MUCH WITH HIS EYES, FACIAL EXPRESSIONS AND BODY LANGUAGE. I THOUGHT THE ENDING WAS A LITTLE ABRUPT AFTER HE GOT HIS MEMORY BACK. BUT OVERALL A GOOD MOVIE."
1,OK for the price,At around five dollars it was OK. There are a few pictures that can be edited in a photo editing software to make usable. Nothing dynamic or interesting about most of the photos. No where near 10K photos on this disc.
2,A Dictionary Of Human Instincts,"This is the best we can come up with?I'm going to recommend another book, (which is definitely a dictionary of human instincts),and that is Cavemen With Cell Phones by Simon Gray.It's simple, straight forward, easy to read, and obviously way ahead what else is out there.Happy reading!"
4,nice read,"I read this book some years ago and gave it away. Years later after searching every flea market and used book store for it I purchased the book again, it is really one of the best books by Kay thorpe. (Lisa went to watch the man she loves marry someone else but she did not know how her life would change and in such a short time. I don't want to spoil anything for you but I highly recommend this book. The older presents are the best."
1,Ultima IX bugs bugs bugs,"The game is either so old, or my copy has to many bugs in it. I can not get parts of the game to load, so can not continue playing it. I had the original game in the 1990's and it was better than this"
3,Good but great!,I bought these seriously because of the price and of course the hefty name - they are good and hold a boat load but I worry still that it might tear up when too much is being filled in it. The regular heft of course is significantly more expensive. Will try those in a few months
3,thanks:},I chose this rating because the bags tear very easy for the high price they cost.I think the cost is high for the bags to tear so easy.Fast shipping thanks:}
4,Trash bags ?,"They're very large,more like lawn bags. My husband likes the bags but they are so big they remind you of the big brown lawn bags."
5,Loved it!!,This was perfect for my 3 year old daughters birthday party...she had such a good time playing with it. It seems a bit smaller than it appears in the picture though...but it was perfect for her and her friends.
3,OK toy for the money,"Bought this for a Dora-loving 3 year old. She and her brother use it more as a tent for their stuffed animals than a beanbag toss game. It has withstood their abuse in that aspect and occasionally it does get used for it's intended purpose, so it was a pretty decent buy for $9.99."
4,Fun for Now,"I bought this for my four year olds birthday party, it was fun the kids seemed to enjoy playing with it. I can't see it being entertaining for long but it served it's purpose and the price is right. And it teaches a little hand & eye cordination, thats good."
3,Way too small,The bean bags are way too small. My son is 2.5 yrs old and the board is just about the right height for him. I cant see how an older kid can play with it. We had more bean bags at home and I tried my son to throw these and oops! the board was so light that it couldn't work even with a slightly heavier bean bag. Well you get what you pay for!
3,Fun Little Thing. Great Price!,This is a fun little toy. It is light-weight and folds flat for storage which is a big plus. It is very durable too as the kids have now played with it for two years.
4,This book is a great first time users guide to Windows98,I just finished reading this book and I must say that it is a great guide for both those who are upgrading from Windows 3.11 or Windows 95. The readers of this book I think will benefit from this book. I hope that more people will agree with me when they take the time to go threw this book.
5,Billy Vera is So Underappreciated... It's a crime,Listening to Billy Vera and the Beaters live is hearing them at their best. The songs range from mirth to melancholy and the musical quality of the Beaters never fails to astound me. In an age where everything is marketing and politics Billy is and has always been a straight shooter. Be one of the few to find this gem in today's music market.
2,"9 Disc Boxed Set, But Contents Disappointing","The average time for each DVD is about 40 minutes, which gives you time for 4-5 artists doing shorter versions of the songs you know.Some are cut ridiculously short. It's fun to watch, but expected more for the money and it would have been better to compile all of this onto 2-3 discs and sell for about 40-50 dollars less. Rhino - You blew it!!"
1,Video equivalent of swiss cheese,"The custodian at CBS swept the cutting room floor and handed the assemblage off to a dim-witted chimp for editing.Frustratingly small snippets of songs.Try this only if you suffer from attention deficit disorder, otherwise you'll be suffering from videoitis interruptus."
2,Not the best DVD from Ed Sullivan and etc.,"The Four Tops, the Supremes, Johnny Rivers, and the Four Seasons were highlights of a mediocre DVD. The Tops did a surprisingly short medley of three of their hits. They looked great up there and there were some humorous parts (I thought). The Supremes looked wonderful as well and Diana primped and sang her heart out, but ""My World is Empty Without You"" was a little too happy for the song's mood and I've yet to figure out what the happening of ""The Happening"" is. Johnny Rivers was incredibly stiff and seemed nervous. The song ended rather abruptly. I was impressed by the Four Seasons as well; being able to visualize that nasally sound from Frankie Valli was wonderful."
3,It's ok,"I was not impressed. The acting was not great, and it was too long. I give it 3 stars because it is still worth seeing because of the action."
1,So dumb it's pathetic,This movie was made to appeal to those with an intelligence level in the mid thirties. The film itself is a take off on the original Kong film with Fay Wray. The original was one of the greatest films ever made. This one is nothing but an embarassment to Peter Jackson who has done better work. Why anyone ever thought to make this piece of trash is beyond me. This is one movie which I gave a lower rating to than Jeepers Creepers. I never thought I would see a movie that would accomplish that feat. This movie was so bad that I wouldn't sit through it if I had a gun to my head. I would beg them to shoot me so as to put me out of my misery.
1,"""It was boredom killed the film""","The one star is for the special effects and the sets...the acting was abysmal! I'm a Jack Black fan, but this was the biggest casting mistake I've ever seen. Adrian Brody seemed like he'd rather be back in Dresden, and although Naomi Watts showed some flashes and looked like she was ready to do some real acting at a moment's notice, she eventually succumbed to poor writing and directing.After a solid hour of tedious and unsuccessful character development, this indulgent movie spent another hour trying to decide if it was Jurassic Park or Lord of the Rings. Even the spectacular climax, with its peerless and amazing animation, became so dragged-out that by the time the beast was done in by the beauty, boredom had killed the movie."
1,"Worse remake than Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, or Oh.. Just any of them","Please people, stop going to see remakes. If we stop going, they will stop making them. Jackson's Kong was worse than the 70's remake of Kong. Much worse. I agree 100% with Floyd the Barber's review. The only thing I will add is that the scene in NYC when Kong finds Anne in the backlite street is a contender for top 2 worst movie moments in history. The audience I saw this with laughed out loud at this moment. I had serious high hopes for this film. I went to the midnight opening for pete's sake. But just like the new Star Wars films these hack filmmakers have let the public down. Most people in this country don't have health care. But they waste millions of dollars on crap films like this. So my call to action is to not give them any more of our hard earned money. Ban all remakes. Tell Hollywood to get new ideas or get out! Thank you, that is all."
1,Another remake of another dull movie,"King Kong was three hours of unbelievable, boring, plotless, nonstop, predictable cliche action. After the first hour I was squirming in my seat, wishing I was at home doing something interesting. The only good points of this movie are the special effects. I didn't like this film because it lacked creative content, there was hardly a plot, no worthwhile moral, all tied together with meaningless action."
1,First review....had to try a lower this.,"I almost passed on renting this and just bought it. I like Peter Jacksons films. Loved LOTR. But this is garbage. The CG looks good by itself, but when live and CG is mixed, looks HORRIBLE!!! Jurassic Park one looked A LOT better. The fight scene with the T Rex and Kong was just too unbelieveable. T Rex fully biting into Kong and no damage whatsoever?!?!?! Come on. Sure am glad I just rented it. I totally agree with all the other one star reviews. Rent it don't buy it."
2,"Ok, but not very good at all","Minus 1 star for the dino stampeed with people running scenes which looked fake and were logically awful. The raptors kill brontos, but a soft kick to the head by a fleeing human knocks them down? The special effects were terrible here and you can tell the actors don't know where to look cause they don't know where the CGI's are supposed to be.Minus 1 star for the whole Jimmy character/subplot. He has this special bond with some black dude and tries to prove himself by being brave. He can also shoot bugs that are crawling on someone, while shaking holding a gun, no problem. Jimmy should have been cut into deleted scenes.I also disliked: when a man swings on a vine with a gun, Kong shaking the girl violently and she has not a scratch, the girl walks like an egyption/juggles...wtf? Random vampire bat attacks on Kong.Overall, not a realistic movie. Has too many over the top moments where you ask yourself, ""how are these people still alive""."
1,5 Stars? Don't think so.,"There is about an hour and a half of plot yet the movie is three hours long. Half the actors can't act, Naomi Watts does a fine job at making her character 1 dimensional and uninteresting. Even the special effects get tedious, just giant stuff just keeps attacking people and that's the movie they don't even make it very exciting. You just hope the characters get killed. There's about 10 people on the ship and then the number keeps changing, people and people who get killed just randomly reappear in the film. It's terribly bad, just because Peter Jackson made it doesn't make it great."
1,Worst movie I've seen in a long time,"This was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. At first I thought the awful acting was a parody. Then I realized the movie was trying to take itself seriously. A pardoy could've been done in 90 minutes. At 90 minutes, this painful experience was just getting warmed up. Terrible acting, terrible believability (ok, maybe that's my fault - expecting plausible stories in a giant gorilla movie), boring pace, and awful execution. About the only thing the movie had going for it were a couple beautiful shots on skull island.Peter Jackson undid all the goodwill he earned from the Lord of the Rings trilogy."
4,King Kong 2005,"Set in the 1930s, Kong again climbs the Empire State Building. Naomi Watts is Ann Darrow. This Kong suffers from an excess of mayhem once the adventurers arrive on Skull Island. The bug scenes are annoying, and it would have been enough for Kong to vanquish two tyrannosaurs instead of three. A consolation is that Naomi does not scream as much as Fay Wray. She develops an affection for the beast. Watts is beautiful and slides into the role naturally. The natives are more sinister than those in the original. The remake is thrilling if you can hang in for 3 hours and 7 minutes."
3,2 1/2 stars for the special effects,"Obviously there's not much more to this movie than the special effects, but they are amazing enough to make it watchable, even at an excruciating 3 hours long."
1,Wait to see it on TV,"This movie was in and out of the theaters in a heart beat- deservedly so. The word tht comes to mind is ""gravitas"" or the lack thereof. Just listen to the delivery of the last line of the movie. No gravitas and no heart. I doubt anybody will be talking about this movie 70 years later."
3,"A bad movie, but with excellent picture","I thought the movie was pretty bad itself with story line and I got grossed out with the bugs, but the picture quality is sure great to watch. Probably the best movie I saw in HD DVD and I own willy wonka, Last Samurai, Fast and the Furious, and Spactacus. The picture quality does not even match close to king kong. I give it three stars just because the movie itself was bad."
1,There's only one Kong,"My six-year old saw a billboard for this and said ""that sign says King Kong but it's not King kong, it's just a silverback gorilla."" I've never been so proud of my boy!Jackson returns to the adolescent indulgence of his early horror movies with the big-budget gloss of those insufferable Ring movies. Too bad, Heavenly Creatures showed such promise.Get the original. It more than holds up and outclasses this steaming heap by a mile."
2,Don't Be Fooled by the Long Reviews. Short and Sweet!,Forget what the CGI nerds are saying. This film was utterly overdone.Too longPointless actionAbsurd situatons with the CharactersGo see it yourself. Be your own judge. Don't be a sucker for what these clowns are claiming. PJ is a good director. But King Kong will be the film most remember for it's mediocre storytelling and entertainment.
2,peter jackson grinds the organ for a big dull monkey of a movie,"after the triumph of ""lord of the rings"", peter jackson deserves a pass. well, this was it. he desparately needed a script editor, in that the opening 45 minutes of exposition should have been pared down to 15 at most. the technological ""advances"" since the real film only serve to point up the inadequacy of cgi: the creatures' look belongs to neither the world of reality nor fantasy, just some pathetic hybrid. add to that the stiff performances of naomi watts and adrien brody (both of whom we know can do better), the amateurish emoting of a miscast jack black, and the superfluous storyline involving the always stunning jamie bell (if kong had ANY common sense, he wouldve opted for him over naomi) which merely gets dropped midstream without any resolution, and we have a gargantuan mess. i will certainly be eager to see jacksons next movie, but after this -- well, he better do good."
4,King Kong meets new age,"I hated to old king kong movies, this one puts story and action together. I know you old timers are going to say otherwise cause of nostalgia, but seriously this movie needed this remake. I always fell asleep watching the black and white king kong movies. Action packed love story with humor, im really glad the way this one turned out."
5,King Kong is Back!!!,Epically portrayed. A perfect remake with a lot of surprises that the original Black and White could not offer. YOU NEED TO SEE THIS FILM!!!!
2,Dull,"Despite all it's criticism over the years, I've always been fond of the 1976 remake of ""King Kong"" and Peter Jackson's version doesn't better it, in my opinion. Obviously the special effects in Jackson's version far surpass those of De Laurentis', but I find the '76 version to be more realistic and less heavy handed. You can actually feel Jackson pulling at your heart strings with his ""Kong,"" and it is is over-played. Additionally, the film is far too long, with a great deal of repetitive and boring scenes. None of the characters, barring Kong, are particularly well-developed. The characterisation of Kong though, is a marvel."
3,a little too good,"Kong is a very good showcase of the capabilities of HD-DVD. However, the transfer may be a little TOO good, as it shows the inherent flaws in the CG/effects. For instance, it becomes blatantly obvious during the brontosaurus stampede that everyone was green screened. There are also many scenes in this transfer where you can see small defects in the CG that weren't caught during the editing process. Because of the lower bitrate/resolution on the DVD version, these issues are not apparent."
5,True to the original version,"Excellent movie, cinematography, special effects. Wonderful how Peter Jackson kept to the original down to the smallest detail. New scenes make Kong more 'human'.May be a little intense for younger children (under 10)"
3,Potentiallly Great Movie Undone By Excess,"Peter Jackson's King Kong is a potentially great movie undone by excess. Set design, special effects, acting, and overall 'atmosphere' are great. There are scenes with real power like the one atop the Empire State Building and in Central Park. But 'the whole' never quite clicked for me because it was too long and too much: too high a gross out quotient; too much improbability (and yes I know this is a movie about a giant ape and a lost island) such as the scene with the humans running amongst stampeding dinosaurs; and too much of a 'let's see if we can top the original movie' mindset like when Kong battling three T-Rexes (what's wrong with battling just one?). After a while it all felt a little tedious despite the real positives mentioned above and particularly the standout performance by Andy Serkis as Kong."
5,Fabulously Spectacular,"""King Kong"" is the best movie of 2005. It is spectacular and you will love it. In the old one(that I have NOT seen) I can tell by all the photos I have saw that he looks very fake. I actually got a FREE MOVIE TICKET IN MY KING KONG VIDEO GAME TO SEE IT. Kong was the most giant animal I have ever seen! I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""KING KONG"" IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO GO TO THE MOVIES ANY TIME SOON. MY GRADE A+! I WOULD GIVE MORE THAN A TRILLION STARS IF I COULD."
2,Dinosaur waterfall.,"Why did we get this? Okay, the giant-pet idea was kinda cute, but - the dinosaur waterfall? Really? REALLY? Oig."
5,"""The King""",This movie surpasses the previous and compares favorably to the original. King Kong defends his lady love unto death. He takes on 3 t rex's! This battle scene rocks! Any t rex weighed in at several tons. In real life the t rex's would have won but this is Hollywood and the good guy prevails. Enjoy!
3,Is this movie still going?,"For Classic movie remakes like King Kong, I am happy that the story line is unwaivering from its original. However, for this day and age, King Kong was just entirely too long. It is almost the same action sequence over and over again that, after a while, proves exhaustingly boring.However, the acting is good and the computer animated scenes are convincing.I still cant figure out how they fit kong on the boat."
4,Jose writes,"My name is Jose Jimenez. And I like to write to you. And this is what I speak. I say it is good to have kings. Then we don't have to vote. Because you don't vote for kings. They just are. And so you don't have no voter's cards. And so you don't worry about this voting. And all the vote for me.No, vote for me!No, me!There is only one king so there is no voting. And if there is to be only one king. I say it should be Kong.King KONG..."
1,No Titanic,No Titanic People been comparing this movie to Titanic Not even in the same life boat as Titanic. No pun intended... This Movie was a drag. I found myself looking at my watch every fifteen minutes. As I notice and hour and Ten minutes went by with no signs of King Kong yet. Save your money and time. Not worth it at all!!! The story line nearly hold your attention. The acting all good but for Jack Black with every scene same impression on his face. You could see the roll was a stretch for him better stick to Comedy and stay out of Action/Adventure films. The digital effects were not that good at all. New York City looked like a big model set with cars. Not to Impressive of the times. In fact the 1976 King Kong to me was more realistic and had better effects.
1,OMG,"Nightmare. The first thing Kong touches is her (blond) hair? Please. Sex, violence and thinly veiled fear and hatred? That's all these people have and all they want to tell and hear stories about. Not that Peter Jackson didn't already show us the color and features of his most griping terror with the ""fighting Urukai."" There are some film makers who should have chosen therapy over film school. Tarentino is one and Peter Jackson is now added to the list. Sheesh."
2,"Pointless, really","This version of King Kong is so similar to the original, it was pretty much pointless to go to all the trouble of remaking it. Peter Jackson, by all means, is a decent director. But with his previous films, there was something ultimately no other director could capture, like with Dead/Alive and Heavenly Creatures. Even the Lord of the Rings trilogy will be really hard to surpass by directors fifty years from now.But King Kong is a bunch of fancier scenes and lines from the original movie, then a ton of extra nonsense just to make it seem a whole lot different and original. This version would have been good if time on the boat, on the island, and in New York afterwards would have been cut in half. It's a drag to watch.I did give it two stars, though, for the special effects and some of the action scenes were pretty cool. I also like Jack Black, so seeing his face in the midst of this was refreshing."
2,Plays like a parody,"With Jack Black, everything plays like a comedy, a parody. He is forever arching his eyebrows and bugging his eyes, foreshadowing the evil about to hit. I'm not sure that was the intention. It makes this third version of Kong the most hokey by far. Also, the movie is a real drag until Skull Island, and that's about 45 minutes in, way too long to wait for the action to start. Most of the movie looks like digital special effects. Was anything real at all? The end is agonizing, but not in a good way. This should have been cut to two hours or less."
2,How to squeeze an entertaining 90 minutes into 3 hours...,"Mildly entertaining, but what a shame that the director didn't exercise some self-control while editing this somewhat bloated movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high after what Jackson had accomplished with his Tolkien trilogy."
1,Lord of the Rings Part IV,"Peter Jackson simply decided to do another Lord of the Rings movie. Every element found here is found in Lord of the Rings.They travel by boat quite a bit. The characters are on a long journey to a far off land: sound like The Fellowship of the Ring?Skull Island is Mordor.The island's natives are just like the orcs.The dinosaurs and other creatures are just like the Nazgul creatures.'King Kong is the just like the ring; he's deadly, but you feel lured in by him in some way.Like the Ring, people are captivated by him, but they know deep down he has to be destroyed.Just a retread of Jackson's earlier work.The CGI? It looks like CGI, and not very good at that.This kind of computer animation is a throwback to films from the 1980s, like the Disney film TRON.A definite thumbs down."
1,It's only good for the last two hours!,I was bored out of my mind for the first hour but it didn't get good till the last two hours. The King Kong vs. T-Rex fighting was amazing. The special effects were great but still I was disappointed. I did like the Ice Dance and Kong on the Empire State Building trying to catch helicopters but you will be disappointed with the first hour. They don't mention about Kong at all. The acting is not bad. Jack Black has a good performance. Main reason why I give this movie one star because I thought it sucked. Only the last two hours are good you probably want to skip through the first hour and just watch the last two. Nothing good goes on with the first hour. Wait till it comes on cable if you really want to watch it. I was just bored!
2,This soooooo lame-o sucks!,"I unexpectedly watch this piece of bug! My classmate invited me to watch King KONG. I said to myself ""It's a disaster!"" After watching the movie, i was right! Then i asked him ""Do you DARE yourself watch this junk?"" Then he said ""What? I liked the movie!"" Then i said ""But i don't"" Our opinions just travel my mind, as King Kong was put to my list of the selection ""The lamest movies i ever seen in my entire life"" as NO.1! I know what i liked!To the director PETER JACKSON who made this unfortunate movie, ""GO BACK AND RE-DIRECT LOTF!"""
1,Not The Extended Cut,"The new Blu-Ray cut of King Kong runs 187 minutes....which means that this is the theatrical version of the movie. I love Jackson, but it seems we always have to wait through this inferior release for the director's cut. The nonsense of the situation is that so many customers have already purchased the DVD of this movie (many bought both the Theatrical and Extended DVD cuts). I mean...how many times are we supposed to buy it. The moral approach would have been to skip straight to the extended cut for the Blu-Ray, but as it was so eloquently put in ""Wall Street""...""Greed Is Good""!"
2,"If you liked ""The Hulk"" you will like this movie...","That sums it up. Instead of a big green guy, you have a giant ape. Endless fight scenes and none of them even close to being physically possible. The computer animation was probably done by bunch of young guys who grew up playing video games, don't even drive cars and know very little of how objects move in the real physical world or simply don't care because they want it to be as exciting as the video game worlds they grew up in. In the old days, they made over-the-top musicals and these days it's over-the-top animation. Also, the CGI just doesn't look real (it never does) but the whole thing is processed in a kind of drab blueish hue to try and meld reality with the CGI world and it just looks murky to me. Honestly, if you find movies like the Hulk basically stupid, you will be disappointed."
2,"Too Long, Too Hollywood, Too Slow!!","I'd looked forward to seeing the remake of this 1933 Classic Movie, but was SORELY DISAPPOINTED with when I watched it DVD yesterday.King Kong was too slow in parts and the slow parts of this movie made it feel six hours long instead of 3 hours long! I think that the filmmakers could have shortened this movie by an hour and had a better film.This movie was way too Hollywood and the overuse of predictable action sequences was very distracting to the movie.The perks of this movie were the story/plot twists that were different from the 1933 King Kong Classic. The acting was great and I was amazed at how realistic the computer animation was in creating King Kong and other creatures on Skull Island.However, I still find the the 1933 King Kong film version to be better than than this one!"
3,She Never Gets Whiplash,"Even after suspending disbelief to get into this movie's world, you have to keep on going. How she keeps from breaking her neck, or even getting whiplash, is amazing. Why can't Kong get around the wall with all of his amazing abilities? What do the natives do for a living -- that is, when they aren't offering people who drop by as sacrifices to Kong? Farm? Do embroidery? (And the scenes with them doing a sort of drugged dance was really worth a chuckle.) All that said, it's entertaining. And most of the unbelievable (in the movie's own world) stuff is in a way fun to see. So I gave it 3 stars. It's worth about $5 to see. (I'm very glad Peter Jackson was much more careful with The Lord of the Rings movies.)"
5,Peter Jackson is the God of Blockbusters. Period.,"This movie is pure cinamatic gold. I was sure that Jackson couldn't live up to Lord of the Rings, but he did. Peter Jackson is a genius and anyone that doesn't like this movie, is looking for too much. Great action, great story, alright acting and fantastic SFX. Peter Jackson should make more movies such as The Hobbit, God of War (PS2 game) and remake Clash of the Titans or Jason and the Argonauts. I would give this movie 6 stars if I could."
3,Jack Black horribly miscast,"I'm usually a Jack Black fan, but he just doesn't have the acting chops to pull this one off. Casting him in this movie would be like casting Weird Al Yankovic as the president in Oliver Stone's JFK. Can you picture Weird Al lifeless on a stretcher evoking our pity? Black's acting style, his goofy face, all distract from the story. Peter Jackson may have seemed infallible after the Lord of the Rings, but there is obviously a chink in his armor."
2,"Bad acting, Bad cast, Way Too Long!!!!!","This has been remade too many times. Why can't they leave a good movie alone? 3 hours is way too long. The original was only an hour and a half or so, which is long enough to watch an overgrown gorilla go haywire. And what was with Naomi Watts' goofy dance? Was that necessary? I thought she was supposed to be afraid of the beast. Instead, she's juggling and making him laugh. Unbelievably sexist and stupid. And the trampling of the dinosaurs?! HELLO!!!! Way too long!!!!! The acting and the script was just plain awful."
3,Don't expect any 'extras' on this version.,"Bought this bluray edition assuming wrongfully that it will include some interesting extra features. The only noteworthy ones were a couple of scenes only found in the extended version. The PIP and concept artwork under the U-control feature is totally meaningless as they appear in tiny screens at the corner of the movie while it is running, being without audio and without the option to expand or pause them! I wonder why they did not include all the extras found in the normal DVD special editions. Shame, because the movie is so much sharper in bluray format."
2,Now a longer version of a movie that was too long?,"OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story. The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics."
1,Bad Language,"It's too bad that Hollywood chooses to use the Lord's name in vain. It leaves a bad taste in one's mind when they do it. I cannot figure out WHY Hollywood adds any kind of bad, vulgare language, let alone blasphemy.This was a BIG let down to me pertaining to the ""Lord"" of the Ring trilogy, Peter Jackson. He really was magnificent in those movies... and gee, they didn't use bad language.The original B&W; King Kong movie is still the best. It's too bad, too. At least the special effects were superb in this new one."
1,Blu-Ray Changes,"I had recently bought the Blu-Ray of Jackson's KONG thinking it would be the best quality, possibly showing me even more detail the CG artists put in. Unfortunately paired with my 120-Hz TV and PS3 player it turned out to be too good! I haven't seen such a false looking movie until now. I could almost see the green screen behind the actors. I must say that Jack Black in HD was not something I needed to see in my lifetime. The disparity between live action and CG was much too obvious. KONG ended up in my local used store and I will most likely stick to Animated (Pixar) movies for my Blu-Ray experience. I would rather have a DVD keep me involved than have the most quality video killing the ""movie-magic"". If you have a decent theater setup I would steer away from the Blu-Ray and go with the DVD instead.King Kong (Widescreen Edition)"
2,king kong,king kong is a long and sometimes boring movie.i wish i would have been a 90 or a little more min. movie.addition to this its story is too classical.
2,like watching a computer game,a big let down for me after the wonderfull LOTR trilogy from director jackson... a lot of trouble has gone into this but ultimately the film falls way short of the mark lost amidst the cgi technology it seems determined to ram down your throat..it is like watching a computer game in parts.... a shame as it could have been so much better
2,Jackson should have watched the original,"All the special effects, technological advances and 70+ years of movie making progress and Peter Jackson can't hold a candle to the original. Someone should have told him he was remaking King Kong - not Mighty Joe Young. Ann Darrow is not supposed to fall in love with Kong, Kong's supposed to fall in love with her.I could cut about 1 hour out of this movie and make it better, but it would still take a distant back seat to the original.I could go on and on, but suffice to say this was a huge dissappointment."
5,I love long movies,I see complaints that this movie was to long.I think it's great that it was long.As a matter of fact i wish it was a little longer so more detail would be shown.Like the extended lord of the rings movies show alot more footage which helps explain more of what's going on.Everyone that went to see this movie new ahead of time how long the show was. So if you don't like watching long movies don't go so you can complain about it later and ruin it for others that do.The movie industry will see your complaints and start shortening the films to the point they make no sense and look chopped up.So for now on look for the feature length and if it's to long don't go or watch something else.Other than that the movie was great.I love the fact this movie has been moderinized.Now i will collect it as i wouldn't buy the original for it was to primative for todays special effects.I love it.
2,unnecessary do-over,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I enjoyed the Lord of the Rings trilogy so much. I expected much better visual effects, there was nothing new here. When I first saw Jurassic Park, I was blown away by the dinosaurs, but now it's been there, done that. Even Kong didn't scare me this time around, I would have prefered a scarier and more gigantic looking ape. The original can't be beat and even the Delaurentis version was more edge-of-your-seat. Digital, smidgital, no improvement of importance here. My two stars are for the jungle sounds, that I liked."
1,GARBAGE!!!,"Given the level of creativity and the seamless implementation of WETA's effects, I expected much more from this movie than a long overdrawn saga. The story was okay, but hindered badly by the poor integration of live-action and cg. I mean, the compositing was just plain lousy and the movements of the large creatures weren't scaled well at all. I was so distracted during the scene in which the characters are running from the herd of brachiosaurs (or whatever they were) by the obvious fakery of the images that I couldn't see past it. Better effects were achieved in the original King Kong. I don't expect to see this kind of crap on screen when it comes from the same people who were behind LOTR.In short, King Kong was overhyped, overbudgeted, underproduced and overall underwhelming. The best example of integrated cg in a film is still the first film to use the technology: Jurassic Park. Let's hope that Peter Jackson decides to take on something less classic and less demanding on the audience."
2,What is the Point of this Movie,"I have seen all the versions of Kong and still wonder what the point is. The theme is...???? Does it really come down to that stupid line at the end of the movie - Beauty killed the Beast? SO WHAT! And why wasn't Denham arrested for so recklessly putting the city in harm's way?????This latest version was perhaps the most excessive, resembling a caricature of all the super-technological special effects movies to hit the modern screen, a combination of Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a host of others that pack of wallop in visual effect but lack a true theme. Maybe now all the remakes will finally end. Go riddance!"
2,"Huge ape, huge dissapointment","Some other reviewers who realized this film is as bad as it is pointed out its many, many flaws, so I won't reiterate them. Suffice it to say, it's not the real King Kong story (girl *loves* ape? Right. . .) And the cartoon physics were so over the top as to make the movie into a true cartoon (except it wasn't funny -- at least not intentially so -- well, perhaps the whole film was a bad joke). Sad. Lord of the Rings was truly exceptional. This film is a parody at best. To recap: little characterization (at least that made sense), no depth, unbelievable motives (again, girl *loves* ape? Sheesh!), and no attempt to make the action scenes believable. What a disappointment!"
1,THE WORST MOVIE MADE !!!,"Oh my god !! i just saw this king kong movie and i was....i am spechless this movie is really really bad !!! jackson's king kong is as bad as spaceballs or even worst. giant Bugs?? huge bats that you can fly on them?? make king kong laugh. i read some reviwes !!!! a master piece ???? i would give this movie cero stars if i could. dont waste your time whathincg this movie, instead apreciate jackson's lord of thr rings.. now that is a master piece."
5,"THIS IS MY JAM, DOG!",OH' MY GOODNESS--THE BIG BUGS WERE SOOOO AWESOME I COULDN'T HANDLE IT--ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WERE OVER 18 HOURS OF GIANT STUPID BUGS!
3,An ok movie,"I came into this movie with high hopes. I was a bit disappointed. It had some good parts. I liked the dinosaur scenes. I really liked the character ""Jack"". Jack Black was perfect for the role of ""Carl"". Although many people die, there isn't a lot of blood. Here are a few things that lowered the rating for me:1. Many of the action scenes were so quick and bumpy that they made me motion sick. That certainly didn't help me enjoy the movie.2. I never really connected with King Kong. They had some times where they were trying to develop that relationship, but I never really connected with him. Therefore, I didn't really care when he died.The biggest problem in these two was the first. It's really hard to enjoy a movie that makes you feel sick when you watch it. Maybe it will be better on the smaller screen."
3,"TOO LONG ""KONG.""","Peter Jackson is a master of creating big, epic action/adventure films. His three-film adaptation ofThe Lord of the Rings Trilogyis a masterpiece of modern film. So I went in to his remake ofKing Kongwith great anticipation. Sadly, a nagging feeling I had about the film turned out to be true. At 188 minutes, this film is just too long. Now, don't get me wrong, there are a number of three-hour plus movies in my collection. But with this film, what could have been an intense, action-packed film turns out to be just one elongated scene after another, nearly derailing the film. And the presentation of a ""love story"" between Kong the Ape and a human woman is kind of handled weirdly. The cast does as good a job as it can with the extended script, and the visual effects and James Newton Howard's score are really good. But this film definitely should have been under two-and-a-half hours. This is only a film for those with a huge amount of patience.Movie Grade: C+"
1,King Kong & Bionic Woman,"Close to 4.30 hours long in which more than half of it were entirely useless and have no relevance to the movie specifically that bombastic CGI Lost World scene. The scenes defies logic and reality with all those acrobatic stunts of Naomi Watts by Kong even a solid unripe hard cucumber would end up mushy. It is totally incomprehensible that our heroine ended up with no bruises, no welts and unbroken bones. Another failed attempt to create a modern epic with an intended complete menu which ended up a spoiled meal."
1,Boring,I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen. A very slow start. Each scene was way too long and over-exaggerated. Give me the original anytime.
2,Desappointed.....,"I was very desappointed with this movie. It was way to long and boring, I think the worst part was you already knew how it was going to end, so I felt I wasted the three hours watching it. I have to admit though the scenery was great, and I did like it when they fought the big bugs.I was mostly desappointed because I figured Peter Jackson would do a great job with this movie, but maybe he should stick with directing fantasy."
2,TOOOOO drawn out Long,"Are these reviewers kidding - the ""best movie?!?"" Special effects were excellent, but that's about it - yet, TOO much it it. Really, enough was enough. It was a ""B"" movie that my family really looked forward to & was sorry to have missed on the big screen. My children (8, 10 & 22 years old) asked 3x in the 1st 1/2 hour ""Are you sure this is King Kong?"" then later, ""Is it over soon?"" though they knew it wasn't by a long shot. Nothing beats the original, as corny as it might have been. The acting was better for some characters, but I felt like I was waiting in a doctor's office for most of the time."
1,Don't buy for kids!,"We were very disappointed with this movie. Our grandsons love the old version and I had no idea within the first five min. it was strong language like ""GD"". We are careful about what we watch and threw the movie in the trash. I feel the movie did not benefit from using foul language but then we feel this way across the board. I assumed the rating was due to violence or little scary for young children."
3,MONKEY STOLE THE SHOW,"Since the movie was built around the ape it's a good thing he came through for us in the end. This is truly visual film in every sense of the word.The actors did the best they could with the few lines they had. Casting was OK, but could have been much better, period clothes and sets looked real.The only reason to see this film is for the great Kong himself. When he's holding his lovely it looks pretty cheesey but when he's ripping the city apart and haulin ass around town it's worth the early movie ticket price.When leaving the theater I didn't hear ANYONE talking about the film, that's a bad sign. I can see why, I must admit I fell asleep several times during the movie. But why should this one be any different than most of this year's offerings?"
1,3 hours too long,"I was really looking forword to this movie. All the things I heard about it on tv and read about it made it sound like it was going to be one of those epic remakes with some great computer generated stunts and other eye candy effects. Plus a great story line that kept the movie moving. Boy was I disappionted. I hope to save you, rent it first. If you like and think its worth the money then buy it. But I didn't find it worth the three hours of my time to watch it."
3,Hmmmm...,"I don't wan't you to believe I dislike Peter Jackson (I'm an avid fan of the Lord of the Rings movies) but he hasn't exactly met his standards with Kong. For one thing, it's over 3 hours (wasn't a problem with Lord of the Rings, because that was just sweeping so you hardly noticed time pass) and Jackson carries on sequences too long. It was entertaining and everything, but don't buy it, please. Rent it or something. It was basically much ado about hardly anything."
3,"Rent for now, buy DVD later...","I'll not cover the actual movie review here (there's plenty of that below in other reviews), but rather the utter lack of ANY additional or bonus material on this DVD. Apparently Universal (and the other studios) are trying to milk absolutely every last penny possible out of us by releasing a bare-bones version initially, then releasing a ""collector's edition"" a few months later.SO, my advice - rent this for now, wait a while until they release the 'special' version before actually buying the DVD."
2,A clean miss,"Watch the 1933 original -- great movie, right? Now sit down and watch this one. Who the @#$% cast Jack Black? Let me make this brief, this movie was an enormous disappointment WITH THE EXCEPTION of the brilliantly acted and shot scenes on the ship as it arrives at the island and gets hung up on the rocks -- I loved it! The actor who played the captain was excellent. I also thought the visuals of the biplanes at the end were extraordinary, but I'd turn the air blue if I described what I thought about the rest of the movie. WAY off target, not worth viewing, honestly, and I expected a terrific movie. I left the theatre really genuinely angry, it's not as bad as ""Alien 3"" but it's in that league, when even little kids were leaving the theatre talking about how they'd have told the story... better."
5,KING KONG HAS IT ALL - TOP RATE ENTERTAINMENT,"The more I watch this movie, the more I am awe struck and taken with it. It is truley the 'Titanic' of 2005. It has it all. It is visually stunning. King Kong is argueably the most well done CGI character ever. 1930's New York city is recreated beautifully. The acting in this movie is excellent, especially Naomi Watts' performance which is mainly reacting to blue screens and a human stand-in for Kong. Andy Serkis also deserves recognition for his portrayal of Kong. The love story between beauty and the beast is done extremely well, this aspect alone is far superior to any other version of this movie. The story is faithful to the original while not coming off as a copy of it. I was on the edge of my seat, I was captivated, and I was even touched by the awesome spectacle that is King Kong. I would have done a few things differently, but I feel King Kong finally got the retelling that it has always deserved. Kudos to Peter Jackson, the man is an artist."
2,"long, over the top","I looked forward to this movie and was terribly disapointed. The movie was 1 hour too long, the special effects were weak, and over the top. Wait for it to come out on cable"
3,The directors cut should be one hour shorter!,"Sorry, Peter J., loved LOTR but you couldn't one-up yourself. If you know the history of the very first Kong movie then you'llrealize that Jackson over indulged his own fantasy and failed to improve on the original simple but effective story line. He did manage to blow me away with the sp. effects but wouldn't that have been sufficient? No he had to triple the number of T. rex adversaries as if one one was was just not enough for todays audience. A colosal encounter with one T. rex with realistic body trauma, not ""Disneyesque"" PG damage would have been far more scarier and involving. One more peeve, New York in the dead of Winter in a strapless gown on the top of the Empire State building with no wind. Not! Jackson convinced me there is a 30 foot tall ape but not that he has been to New York. This type of incongruity diminished a potentially great film. Hopefully, there will be a one hour shorter ""directors cut"" then Ill watch it again."
4,Almost perfect,"Shave about half an hour off of the hour-and-twenty worth of character development, and this is a solid piece of entertainment. The leads make the first half of the movie watchable, and once the big man himself gets into the picture (Kong, that is. Not Jack Black) it's non-stop till the last frame. The effects are mind-blowing (particularly the brontosaurus stampede), the set-pieces are expertly timed and delivered (the insect pit delivers the kind of full-body-shivers we haven't had since Indiana Jones), and the Empire State Building climax is truly dizzying and spectacular.Mr. Jackson may have gone a little overboard on the Getting-To-Know-You's of this one, but the ultimate payoff is well worth it.PS - heed the PG-13 warning. Definitely some elements that'll give the young ones nightmares (very big, very realistic bugs--and lots of 'em)."
2,"Long, Long, Long... and Jack Black Can't Act","The best part of the whole film is the ape. Superb special effects bring Kong to life but I didn't need 3 hours to admire it. Mingled in between for what seemed like eternity was a bit lifted right out of Jurassic Park replete with horrible special effects looking like they were from a cheap Japanese Godzilla film years ago (they obviously spent all of the effects budget on the ape). And... someone PLEASE tell Jack Black to take some acting classes. How a marginal talent like this guy lands a gig like this movie is beyond me. Completely mis-cast with that dopey half smirk on his face the whole 3 hours. If you want to see King Kong, the original is still by far the best. ** BnB Beatles Depot **"
3,King Kong Misses The Boat....Barely,"The Extended Version of ""King Kong"" is a better movie than the theatrical one released in 2005. The two scenes put back from Skull Island should of never been deleted in the first place! They added excitement and tention to this movie. My main problem with this version is they didn't add MORE deleted scenes back to help explain some of the gaps left in the original theatrical film. For example, the extended scenes on the boat work better ,and makes us CARE more about the characters ,and why some of them risked their lives to save Ann Darrow. This part of the film still suffers because of poor editing choices. It's a shame that Mr. Jackson didn't take advantage to fix this problem. Still ""King Kong"" is a good film ,and I recommend the Extended Version over the original one."
4,Best Kong Effects Of The Three,"A super colossal screen spectacle. There are moments in this film that are so intense, my wife refuses to watch it again. The makeup and special effects are top rate, even haunting at times; giant man-eating insects and really eerie looking natives. Probably a little more than the average under 12 year old needs to see. The dinosaur stampede was a little hard to believe though, well done but hardly survivable. We're talking smash-city for everyone involved! Very touching at times, this Kong probably garners more sympathy than previous screen Kongs, and the New York scenes will keep you guessing; ""how'd they do that?"" Especially when you consider it was shot largely in New Zealand. Very well done, but not quite the box office runaway that was expected."
5,awesome,"awesome,very happy great movie and statue. received in great shape, statue is very cool. would buy again from your company."
5,Excellent Movie!,Peter Jackson did not disappoint with his interpretation of King Kong! Special effects fantastic along with a really good story line!
3,Works great but box came damaged.,"The movie works great and all and I love it...however, when I received the Blu Ray, the bottom corner of the case was completely chipped off. This should not have happened... it makes me weary of purchasing any more Blu Rays from here."
5,KING KONG BLU-RAY,"EXCELLENT BEST PICTURE & SOUND.EXCELENTE PELICULA MEJORARON DEMASIADO EL SONIDO Y LA CALIDAD EN IMAGEN.PERFECTA PARA LOS QUE VIVEN EN CASA SIN VECINOS AL REDEDOR. ""ALTO SONIDO"""
5,All you need,"I searched high and low for this version of King Kong and it was well worth the hunt. Packed with tons of extras, it has all you could ever need to see and hear from Peter Jackson's latest work."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:King Kong is far too long, gains nothing from its two lead males, and has a tendency to drag, but features a stirring conclusion at the top of the Empire State Building and a sweet relationship between Naomi Watts and the CGI ape--it's a mixed bag, but worth seeing."
2,King Bomb,"If you like special effects, you'll love this movie. If you like good acting and intelligent script, don't waste your time.There is very little to like about this movie other than the CGI effects. Watch either of the other two King Kong movies instead."
2,3 Wasted hours,They could have cut the first hour out and it still would be a waste of time. The only good thing about this movie was King Kong. Its a shame what they did to such a great classic film.
5,King Kong,This movie is about the King-Kong that is a big ape was attacked from people in antrodden island.I thought the movie was very sad because a big ape die in finish.I would recommend this movie because this movie is very impression.
2,I must be missing something,This is just a mediocre remake of an incredibly classic film. The original is one of the world's greatest films. They recreated 1933 NYC with new technology.....the real 1933 NYC is visible in the original movie. Very overrated film. Perhaps I expoected too much. The 18 inch rubber Kong doll used in the original was more intimidating.
1,Peter Jackson and Universal ripoff,Why is there 3 different versions of this movie???? most people prefer to see the special features!!! most dvds have the widescreen /fullscreen on 1 disk and the 2nd disk is also included with the special features. i guess Pete and universal want everyone to buy all 3 along with his production diaries since the movie didnt make what they expected thanks for the ripoff keep your special features!!!!!!!!!!
4,real good,great picture great sound awesome remakedont care for jack black long and gets longerwith the extended cut drags on a little but still good
3,Too Much of a Good Thing,"The special effects were out of this world, but sometimes the story line got lost in the prehistoric jungle."
4,peter jackson is the best,"well,i missed this movie on theatres.recently i get to watch it on dvd.my god!one of the best movie i have seen in the recent times.and the performances by Jack Black,Adrien Brody...simply wonderful,along with the computer graphics,special effects,peter jackson has recreated the wonderful era.i enjoyed this...a must watch film.highly recommended."
3,Too Long,"This movie could have been cut in half and it would have been much better. There were some great scenes, such as the encounter with the very scary natives, but the dinosaur scenes were drawn out too long. My biggest complaint is the incredible number of facial closeups of Ann Darrow starring at Kong, a dinosaur, or something else. There were so many of these ""dramatic effect"" instances that they began to resemble dumb looks instead of looks of amazement."
2,"Good in parts, but too long.","The 2005 version of King Kong started out great, with a good flavor of New York during the depression. Eventually it gets too long: dinosaurs and people getting killed or injured all over the place, over and over again. And the Empire State Building scenes also drawn out at the end. And why were those guys in the planes shooting at Kong when Ann was up there too in bullet range. Maybe he was such a menace that they had to sacrifice her in order to bring him down? I wonder why I never thought about that when I viewed the original 1933 version.So this new version shows a relationship between Ann and Kong. Cool. They could have cut the film down by at least a half hour and accomplished the same thing. When we watch the extras on other DVDs, we see those good deleted scenes that were taken out because they were dragging out the film or parts of it too long. How come nobody thought about that here?As at least one other reviewer said, I won't be watching this again."
5,Action movie by Peter Jackson,The christmas movie of 2005. I can't wait to see it. Adrian Brody and Naomi Watts play the lead. I love Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. The story is famoous and Peter Jackson's storytelling and action are brilliant.
3,Not even close to great,"I cannot believe a movie that was over 3 hours long got so little accomplished. Ther look of the film starts out very good but when they get to the island it is like watching a cartoon. All that I heard about this movie was how awesome the fights are but they dragged on as badly as the rest of the movie does. Jack Black is not bad playing an actual actor though he does not have a lot of range. The thing that really set me off was that he has the final words of the movie and wtf, he ends up being the smart one?I hate to repeat something I have I have read on here about a hundred times but I must say it again, do not expect anything close to Lord of the Rings. Overall there are some touching moments with Kong but I would really recommend this movie to children."
1,Visually stunning. But a terriable movie,"BORING. LONG. It stars Jack Black, which automatically makes it bad. But the drawn-out story just makes it worse.On the positive side, it looks good. HD-DVD is a winner. And the fairly reasonably priced XBox 360 HD-DVD adapter is well worth every penny."
3,"Uneven, but entertaining.","I'm really split on how I feel about this movie. Did I like it? By and large, yes. Was it as good as I was expecting? Unfortunately, no. I think the problem I had with it is the story arc is just too simple to be made into a three hour epic. There were several times I said to myself ""enough with the CGI creatures and crawlies, let's get on with the story."" I'm becoming more and more convinced that CGI is too powerful a tool for most movie makers to handle. There simply isn't enough restraint while using it. Peter Jackson should have stuck with the LOTR movies, as they were more in the nature of an epic storyline. Kong felt like a movie being forced into an epic, as if Peter Jackson felt he had to follow in his own footsteps. If you're looking to kill three hours while being mildy entertained, then Kong is a good choice."
1,Buyers Beware...,This is just not acceptable from Amazon. Why are the DVD's I just bought all looked like they've been used?? I bought 300 for DVD and it has a bunch of fingerprints on it. This one has smears like if it was washed by a dish washer. I bought this brand new (Suppose) I guess not! There's no mention in the description that this is a refurblished product. Just NOT ACCEPTABLE! DO NOT BUY DVD'S from Amazon.
3,"Good movie, but...","I really loved this movie, but Jack Black is an awful actor. It will always be a mystery to me as to why they chose him for that part. This movie could've been great had they cast an actor with talent to play that role."
3,"Big, noisy, and long","If you've been waiting your whole life to see a giant ape battle, not one, not two, but three T-Rexes at once, then BY GOD YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW.If not, be warned it is over three hours long."
5,"Amazing, Beautiful, Heartfilled","I believe this movie was the best movie of the year, a very close runner up was Batman Begins.This movie was beautiful. I loved how the changed the story a little. Instead of a dingy screaming blonde that King Kong is chasing after, they made the blonde girl, Noami Watts, a smart, loving, caring woman who loved King Kong and was his best friend.I also liked how they changed the blonde girls love interest from the actor, to a plain joe type. Great actors in this film. Jack Black was great. Noami Watts deserved some type of award for this part.I loved the scene when King Kong finds Noami Watts in the city and he slides around on the ice as he holds her."
3,weirdly unimpressed...,"everyone raved about the film when it came out, and so i was excited when i went to the cinema to see it. but, after leaving the screen i found myseld oddly let down. the film was okay, sure - and had some breathtaking scenery and shots. but that's all it was, really. i wasn't gripped and there was no real, bold underlined plot which i think it probably. i dont think kong should have died at the end - i think there were many alternate endings that could have been used. maybe i was just tired at the cinema but i left going ""humff,"" you know? good film but not great."
5,Watch out Steven Spilburg!,This is the best film in years! Way better compared to Steven Spilberg's War of the worlds! The special effects are truly amazing! Get this movie or your not a true Kong fan!
1,Stick with the 1930s original!,"Why do they re-make good movies. They were good to begin with. They should re-make bad movies and try to make them better.This movie was more of a bad video game than a movie. The special effects were so obviously inauthentic that they were almost laughable.The first hour was fine, and was comedic. Then the movie got into gore when the party got to the island, and any thought of comedy disappeared. It seemed like a horror movie. And then when Kong appeared, it switched to action/fantasy. In New York, it was just plain silly."
5,"Amazing, Stunning",I love King Kong. It is one of the best movies Peter Jackson has done. It is my favorite. Is it yours?
4,It was not beauty that killed the beast but length,"Please Universal, in an age of Directors cuts can you give us a special ""Editor's Cut"" of Kong? Limit it to 104 minutes like the original and remove all the filler of the 3 hour monster we currently have. I don't dislike the film. I actually like it, but I feel there is a lean and mean version of the film trapped under pounds of extra celluloid film fat. I want to be able to watch the film over and over again without constantly fast forwarding to the good parts. In the original I never felt the character's dialogue was overdrawn or the romance undersold, problems I find in the new version. So please give us a 104 minute bare bones version at a reasonable price and watch your sales soar."
3,A little disappointed....,I was a little disappointed that it shipped without the sleeve. I really liked the sleeve on this bluray but they shipped it naked....
5,King Kong is one the best blu-ray,"King Kong is one the best blu-ray,,, this is a must havethe sound is a 10+ and the pic is a 10+"
3,Get me out of this jungle,"I thought I was never going to get out of the jungle. I knew eventually we were going to wind up in New York City, but after two hours we were still on the island. The visuals were good, but the gymnastic abilities of the characters was a bit much. The female lead had more lives than a cat and the characters outrunning a herd of brontosaurus size dinosaurs was pretty hokey too. They definitely could have shortened the film and made it more tolerable to sit through. King Kong sliding on the ice rink in Central Park was a little much to take as well. I liked the original version made in 1933. Even the 1970's version was better."
4,waiting for the more deluxe blu-ray version,that way i can buy the movie only three times instead of four.
3,totally illogical movie,"Not that a fantasy movie is supposed to be logical, but it loses credibility rather quickly. EVERYONE should have been killed in the dinosaur rampage. The girl should have been killed 10 times over during the fight scenes with the dinosaurs. Brody should have been attacked before finding the girl. It goes on and on. The insect pit was a waste of time and contributed NOTHING to the story - it's only a chance to show off the latest technologies. This was a pure endulgence for Peter and WETA, and nothing more. I am very disappointed that the priorities of this movie were so far off base. Everything looked so CGI, except Kong, believe it or not. That's where they went wrong. Had Peter just focused on the main story line, and not gotten side tracked with cheap thrills and gross outs, we would have a much better movie. Remember, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should."
3,It really wasn't all that !!!,"I went to the theatre to see this. It was okay. It wasn't the big blockbuster that everyone was coining it to be. I gave it three stars for the special affects and Adrien Brody. I liked him in the pianist but it makes me wonder why he would waste time in this. I guess he's gotta eat too! Other than that, this was kind of an uneventful movie. It's okay to rent once and throw it back but I wouldn't buy this mess not unless I could get it used for under 5 bucks at amazon."
3,Kong Falls Short,"I enjoyed the special effects, but I didn't think the casting was appropriate. Jack Black had moments where he really fit the part, but at other times he simply suffered from type-casting in his frat-house movies; and that really comes across in this film. The self-absorbed lead actor and the leading lady faired much better. Story sticks to the original from the 1930s, and that is probably a good thing. Initial scenes on Skull Island were awesome and frightening. The script moves from a tongue-in-cheek version of the original to some lame efforts as a serious epic production. The movie was probably about 30-45 minutes too long."
2,Overblown Hype: Big-time Disappointment Here,"First of all let me say I really wanted to like PJ's KK. It saddens me to say this thing was just overdone in every conceivable way. NY opening, boat trip, Skull Island, Back to NY...all way too long. Dinosaur fight scenes go on forever (and why did Jackson think three T-Rexes would be better than one??? because they ain't). Spider-pit scene is just plain gross and, once again, goes on too long. This film suffers what I'm calling the 'Matrix' effect. Like the Matrix sequels what would have made a decent, no more than 2hr film, becomes an overlong snoozer. Give a director creative carte blanche and a blank check and you get an overblown mess. Someone should have made Jackson deliver a movie an hour shorter. Save the version I was subjected to theatrically for the 4 disc DVD you know is coming in time for Christmas this year."
2,Too Long and Too Slow!,I fell asleep ten minutes into this film. I thought Jack Black was miscasted. LOTR is awesome but King Kong was slow paced and boring. The best part of the film was when they fight the giant insects. The insect part was great.
4,3-Disc Extended vs. 2-Disc Theatrical,"I just wanted to clarify to potential buyers that the 3-disc version includes an entirely different set of special features than those included in the 2-disc version as well as a longer cut of the film. So if you are a die-hard fan, and willing, there is good reason to dish out $ for both versions. If you'd prefer only one version and are not interested in the special features, I recommend the extended cut as the scenes added back in are definately worth it."
4,A very epic and memorable film,"Seeing King Kong (2005)reminded why I liked movies in the first place, it takes you on a journey that captures your imagination and carries you through a series of emotions and makes you feel like a kid again. I believe its destined to become a new classic and when people remember the films of 2005, King Kong would definitely one of the most forefront on our minds. Bravo to Universal Pictures and especially to Peter Jackson, for remaking the film that made him want to be a filmmaker in the first place. It's a great film and most certainly one for the books."
3,"very nice,but not great","took too long to get the the reason why we came to see this.but once kong made his appearence,it was a brisk 3 hrs.my major gripes are these;the way kong was manhandling ann,she would have died.every bone in her body would have been snapped.the whole dinosaur stampede/pile-up was silly.humans running with them should have been roadkill.AND they have nerve to be punching the dinos as they are running among them!!!!!!!!!!!!!lastly,why does everyone/thing fall in love at first sight?!?!?!some parts looks as though mr jackson took days off and let some goofy intern sit in the chair.its a very good remake,a nice hollywood ''event'' but far far away from great."
2,A solid C grade for this one,"For the amazing special effects, which is Peter Jackson's forte, I give it an A+. For the long, silent, emotive looks from Naomi Watts, I give it a B-. But for the ridiculous last line of Jack Black (as well as his bad acting), I give it an F. Average that together, and you get a solid C grade. The creepy giant insect scene make your skin crawl for days."
4,Do away with the ice pond and it's 5 stars,"This film delivers what it is suppose to deliver: FUN. This isn't serious drama, this is cartoon type fun. Jack Black was terrific as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody was okay as the hero and Naomi Watts was great as Ann, the beauty loved by the beast. That said, the star of this film is the giant ape and a wonderful job they did bring the beast to life. I did not care for the scene on the frozen pond in New York. That really was dull and contrived, but the rest of the movie moved along well and it did not seem three hours long. The supporting actors were also very good, including the cameraman, the captain and of course the male movie star. Was it better than the original? Well, I loved the original and I was prepared to be disapointed by a remake. I was not however. If only all remakes could live up to this standard."
4,KONG is still the KING,"first time i saw this movie with my father around 1976-1977 ; now newest version still good ( better i thought ) . good sound, good image, and good stars....specially you Mr. Black"
4,"Great Movie, horrible packaging","King Kong is a great movie, the extras on this edition are very interesting to watch but the only let down is the packaging, this is not a deluxe edition it's ""cheaper edition"", I was waiting something more like the extended editions of the lord of the rings but Universal didn't want to spend money on this set. Try harder next time, King Kong deserves something better"
4,Worth seeing once,"One of our neighbors loaned my husband his copy. I didn't want to see it for two reasons. The biggest was it's too long. In my opinion, no movie should be over 3 hours long. The other is I've watched both the 1933 original version and the 1976 one with Jessica Lange.I walked in when the woman was being offered to Kong by the natives. That's where it gets interesting so I sat and watched the rest. I don't feel I really missed anything. And I have to admit that it was pretty darn good. The time went fast with all the magnificent special effects. And even if I thought the plot of Kong and Ann Darrow (played this time by Naomi Watts) silly, it did manage to be touching at times. Well, at least I felt for the big beast.I think anyone can enjoy this movie once. It's a good popcorn movie."
1,No Progress in 73 years.,"First and foremost, the original 1933 version of King Kong stillstands as the quintessential monster movie. The special effectsare still unsurpassed, realistic and wrenching. The cast is perfect, especially Fay Wray who by herself invented the movie scream. the fact that the original is seen in glorious black and white adds to the films moodiness and mystery. In short, it is an unequaled work of art that required no further rendition.Now to the recent remake. I titled this review No Progress because as soon as I saw the action on Skull Island I realized that the CGI looked cartoonish, unrealistic, phony and remarkedthat 73 years later, film making took a giant step backward.This remake, like many others is a classic example of subtraction by addition. The sad fact is that many young peoplewill only know this colorized version and not appreciate theextraordinary vision and achievement of the original.No, it wasn't the airplanes. it was CGI killed the beast"
2,Konged Out,"This is in a nut shell a long, loosely connected, hog-pog of random non-stop action and melodrama; yet there is still much merit to it.If Peter Jackson proved anything with Lord of the Rings, he proved he could create perfect fantasy worlds. In this CG master-piece we get to see Dinosaurs in far better quality than Lord of the Rings and ruins in far greater beauty than Indiana Jones. Even the old world of New York city was captured with a supreme beauty.That said everything is down hill from there. The action is so wild and so over played and so ridiculous people were laughing in the theater just because it was so over done.Story Line, I think Peter Jackson's work with Lord of the Rings should speak for itself. What story there was, was laughable, and so loosely connected it seemed as if it were just a board author rambling to himself.The movie was entertaining, but that's about it."
2,"I tried to like it, I really did.","I wasn't going to watch KING KONG but with all the great reviews from everyone I said what the hell I will go and watch this so called ""instant classic"". Man was I disappointed. First of all the movie started out way to slow. They spent to much time on the boat just trying to get to Skull Island. I gave it 2 stars because once they did make it there the special effects were great. The movie had some good action scenes in it with Kong fighting the T-Rex and when he was in New York on top of the Empire State Building. But the movie just dragged on for an hour to long. There were a lot of scenes that could have been cut or shorten and the viewer would not have lost anything from the story line. Overall I did not walk out of the theater last night thinking man I just saw a classic. If you are wanting to watch a classic go pick up Lonesome Dove."
3,Higher Definition on Low Quality,The WETA folks must have took the year off when they were working on King Kong because this movie looks horrible in HD. The compositing errors and weak green screen work are only highlighted by the HD DVD's quality.
2,JUST A REVIVAL,"I thought it was gonna be a very much more interesting movie. The Plot It's Ok in general, just Ok. Don't get me wrong, there are many parts as intense as the movie really deserves it, but please dinosours??? Giant insects? Smart Insects? Giant Bats? Big Iguanas? But the worst of all, is to see Naomi Watts dancing as a fool in order to get rid of KK. Not to say that watching KK lought at her did not made me lough at all.The effects are great, what ever... but I can see why it has no Oscar in hands, just as Peter got for TLOTR.It has to much o many things that do not belong there.In general it's just entertaining, but it does not do more than that. It was a just one time to see movie.I do not pretend to have reality, I undestand it's fantasy, but come one... PJ just went off the normal.The rest it's just what made theother KK movies cruel...But asa movie, it's just better than the other because it's newer, more modern... that's all.It's your choise."
2,Cinematic Nonsense,This film is utter nonsense; there is no novelty with the special effect as there was back in 1933 - the 1933 movie is greatness personified ; the acting is poor and Jack Black made it feel like a stupid comedy instead of an adventure of even remotely epic pro portions.If you like long movie u can go and buy it ...if you like good movie you can buy the 1933 version.NOT RECOMMENDED
