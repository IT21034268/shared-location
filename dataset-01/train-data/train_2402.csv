1,What the [...] is this [...]!,"This is utter B.S. This movie sucked big time, easily the worst movie I've ever seen. Instead of putting all those millions of dollars into a movie production, Tom Cruise and Spielberg should put all that money to work for the needy and build a hospital for poor children or something. Oh wait!, that wouldn't be a good idea after all, Cruise is not capable of doing much, let alone be in charge of helping kids in need."
2,it's a shame,I have to admit that I didn't like this movie very much. It shows Tom Cruise's domestic circumstances but this subplot doesn't seem to be woven well with the rest of the movie.
3,up and down ride,The special effects were just great-leaving you on the front of your seat and scared-The acting was fair with a fair story line and to much screaming from Dakota Fanning--The special effects rate a 4 but overall the movie gets a 3 for trying hard.
1,SHUT THE KID UP!!!!,"This movie is great as far as special effects and keeping in tune with the book, but Spielberg, having to make a ""family"" situation again, has this little girl in the movie who is bossy, and a brat, who screams in a high pitched voice with her tantrums with Cruise calming her down over and over. It is annoying as all hell. Who wants to watch a parent trying to calm down a screaming bratty kid throughout the movie! It was irritating! Just because Spielberg makes a movie, he doesn't piss gold. If he leaves the ""family orientation"" out of some of his movies and get right down to a decent plot, it would be more enjoyable. Less kid screaming in the future please."
3,Enjoyable Film,"I thought the film was highly enjoyable. Although Spielberg could have cast another actress in place of Dakota Fanning. She reprised almost the same character that she played in ""Hide and Seek"".The special effects were spot on.And here I must take issue with a previous reviewer about comparing the aliens to a ""wretched tv series"". I assume he was referring to the X-Files. The X-Files, at least the first five seasons, were some of the best science fiction to have ever hit television. But I digress: My opinion is that the aliens in ""War of the Worlds"" were more akin to the aliens in ""Independence Day"".Good script. I also found the actions of the survivors plausible."
1,Wooden Acting,"I found this film ridiculously bad for Tom Cruise to be in. Tom's all right, it's just his movie son and daughter seem unbelieveably bad. I'm not saying acting is easy, especially when you are about 9 and 16, but I thought their acting lacked character, believability and any shred of credibility.I also didn't find the plot believable what so ever. Just not my type of film I guess."
3,"If you are not too critical, it's worth a watch.","'War of the Worlds' is one of the classic Science Fiction stories that has been transformed into the most famous of all radioplays, a 1953 movie and many more in many languages.Steven Spielberg has now taken his turn for interpretation, and 50 years after the first movie this one is certainly not bad. But it will never be a classic.Basically the movie is a long chase movie where Tom Cruise and his children are being chased by the invaders from space: the tripods.The characters can be very very annoying so you have to get through that. The children are brats. The older brother is not listening to anything and just doing what he wants and the younger sister is constantly screaming and disrupting.I'm glad they stayed close to the book and movie, only the place of handling has changed somewhat.The special effects are of course in good order, but what else could you expect in a Spielberg movie"
2,"Lots of Special Effects, little meaning or plot","If you didn't read the book, the movie will make little sense to you. Most of the story is based on the main character running away from the machines, and it gets tedious after a while because the plot doesn't change much. Most of the action is at the beginning and the end, and the middle pretty much fills up screen time. The characters are poorly developed, and interactions between them are overly and unecessarily dramatic.But there are good special effects for the aliens and the machines, slightly redeeming the poorly developed characters. The movie doesn't really explain many of the concepts behind the plot, and assumes that you'll know them, making some parts of the movie very confusing and pointless."
1,Boring and worst Spielberg movie yet!,"I think Spielberg conned a lot of people into seeing this movie based on his reputation. Well, his reputation isn't quite so good anymore. Just about everyone I've talked to who has seen this movie agrees that it is just plain boring. The original was significantly better. There is no plot to this version, you wait and wait for the action to happen and it never happens. The special effects (what little there was) were mediocre at best."
2,Proof that good special effects cannot save a movie,"Regardless of the impressive special effects, this movie is REALLY bad. The dialogue and character development are shallow and uninteresting. The alien-human confrontation in the basement was just like the dinosaur-human confrontation in the kitchen of Jurassic Park (mirror trick and everything). Nothing really innovative here. I giggled out loud when Cruise sings the lullaby from ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" to calm down his daughter. Wow. This is a bad movie."
1,boggles the mindless .......,"So, these machines have been buried for just how long? and the aliens travel via light? Yet, they senselessly vaporise, and ignite [?] in some cases the homo sapiens creatures, when they really need bodylfuids, as vaguely demonstrated later .....We never get to drive in a tripod's cockpit, and the aliens? They look vaguely like the ancient Kennedy ladies at bergdorffs, rummaging through bargain basement.The earlier version was by far more satisfying.Considering the immense budget - this one falls short and is rather flaccid and impotent.Viewing for the numb-less, or is that numbed?"
3,Shut That Little Girl Up,"I am a big science fiction fan, so I will usually end up watching them all sooner or later. In this movie the special effects were excellent but I never really developed any attachment to the characters. I will keep this short and sweet since nearly every aspect of this film has been covered --- however there were times during the movie when the thought passed through my mind ""Oh hell, feed the girl to the aliens and be done with it."" The screaming was annoying, as was the teenager boy's antics. I just didn't care whether they made it or not."
1,One star for special effects...,"Great specials effects, decent direction, OK acting but (and this is important I think) no plot."
5,Will blow you out of the water!,"I just got back from seeing it. This movie is awesome!!! I loved it! Some parts make you jump and throughout the whole thing, you think, ""How the heck are they gonna stop this?"" You will never suspevt the ending and one part almost made me cry!"
2,Really Weak -,"The movie struggles, primarily because of the ridiculous extra conflicts thrown into the plot - mostly involving Tom Cruise and his two children. Further, Cruise himself adds nothing, and the film's introduction of the 'space-men' couldn't be more implausible if Spielberg tried. Eventually, just as hope is almost lost, the invaders from other worlds succumb to plain old bacteria. (But what about the effect on humans of the alien bacteria they brought with them?) Further, the film's depiction of airplanes falling out of the sky and cars dying because of an enormous electromagnetic pulse doesn't square with reality - both have their own sources of electricity and could continue operating."
4,I loved it despite the bad ending.,"I've heard alot of people complaining that this movie sucked and how bad it was, but let me just say that I thought it was really good. The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. I really felt like I was there running away from the aliens and tripods. My only complaint with the movie is the ending. It really was a boring ending and left a lot of questions unanswered. It seems like they just wanted to tie it in really quick and end the movie all of a sudden. It was so insane how they escaped all the situations. It's defanitly not the greatest movie ever made, but I was really impressed with the special effects. The sound the tripods made was just chilling."
3,Too much Tom Cruise.........no enough aliens.,"I went to see a war of the world movie and they gave me a movieabout Tom Cruise's relationship with his two kids and ex-wife.I found the movie very good, but too much Tom and family justbrought it down. Looks Stephen Spielberg lost a bit of hismagic...or was he influence by the major studio's.I surely hope there is a extended version comming out therewith added footage of the alien invasion..and less of Tom+family."
2,"Beautiful to look at, empty of character","These days, amazing and realistic special effects are the price of entry for any film that wants to be taken seriously in the U.S. marketplace. And Spielberg, one of the inspirational creators of the modern standard in special effects, delivers visually without missing a beat...but fails pitifully where it comes to story and characterization. As a huge fan of the George Pal classic with Gene Barry as the beleguered hero, I desperately wanted this latest ""War of the Worlds"" to be as just as fascinating. Instead, the performances are wooden, predictable and--yes--boring. Rent it to say you've seen it; the effects are indeed excellent. But don't spend any more time or money unless you're going back for the PAL version. This one disappoints mightily."
1,terrible,"Terrible acting, terrible storyline. The little girl singlehandedly lowers the score because of her overacting."
3,The problem is the original WOTW had so much CLASS,"War of the Worlds is not the worst Hollywood movie about Aliensblowing up people, its just that it doesn't feel all that new and original. I love the original WOTW movie, as most people.I feel this one, didn't develop and add to the old movie, the book or even the radio series, there was a huge potential to do something very cool with modern day scenario.But I love slam, bam, action movies like the rest of us and there is some cool action requences, my favourite being the boat sequence.The Aliens also SOUND way cool and creepy, which was fresh.So, overal, dont expect much of anything different , a pure popcorn flick, check your brain at the door and enjoy.DVD although only worth renting or picking up cheap."
4,"Not Perfect, But Very Enjoyable","Despite some negative reviews, I watched this movie and was very surprised. It is a good, entertaining movie. Tom Cruise does a good job as well as Dakota Fanning (per usual). Yes, there are some plot holes in here and yes, the ending seemed a little forced, but overall, there is a lot of tension in this movie. Spielberg, as always, creates special effects that capture the imagination. I loved the alien hand scene and thought that it looked cool. The movie dragged a little bit in the basement scene and underutilized Tim Robbins - could have done without it. But I thought it captured the fear of the situation very well throughout the movie. One disappointment was a lot of unneccesary language (GD and S words), so the edited for TV version would be better to watch. Very entertaining, though, and worth a watch. And unlike some Spielberg movies, which are a half and hour too long, this one clocks in under two hours."
4,The movie was all Dakota Flanning.......,"Cruise is our Everyman - a common labourer with designer jeans and a sports car. His ex-wife leaves their 2 kids with him for the weekend, even if they don't think much of their dad. However, what she doesn't know is that our world is being watched by intelligences greater than our own and they are planning to attack. Narrated by a pseudo-serious Morgan Freeman, it quickly becomes apparent that while Tom's character may not be able to save the world, he sure as hell is going to try to save his family. What follows is an pretty decent sci-fi film which would have benefited heavily from a little less Tom, to a bit more Dakota."
2,"Great potential, but fell far too short.","I watched this movie for the first time last night. I've heard that it was ""OK"", but watchabe. So I watched it. I liked the beginning, it was story building about Cruise's character Ray and how it all started. It was very suspenseful through the chase scenes and the will-they or won't-they be caught scenes. But it wrapped up so quickly that it was insulting to the viewer. I was really into the movie for a while, but all of a sudden, it ended; and without good reason. It's almost as if the guys ran out of money to make or ran out of ideas to end it. It had a lot of potential, but it just lacked an ending. It's certainly worth watching once, but I wouldn't bother with it again."
1,Picture Quality Worse than DVD,"I notice a lot of folks spend more time reviewing the movie than the actual quality of the disc. So here goes:I have approximately 350 + Blu-Rays and this is by far the worst quality disc I have ever seen! Seriously, I have never seen such a grainy picture in my life. I played the movie on my 65"" Panasonic (brand new) and was extremely disappointed. I ended up turning the movie off about 45 minutes in. Don't waste your dollars on this. If you're wondering what kind of player I was using, it is an OPPO BDP-95 which is an audiophile grade player that is better then 99% of players on the market so I'm sure this horrible picture quality wasn't due to my player."
1,Don't waste your time and money on this loser,"This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Massive budget and that't it. No plot, no character development, poor direction, lousy screenplay, amateurish overacting, poor casting, etc. I was hoping the aliens would win and quickly vaporize the cast so I wouldn't have to suffer through this train wreck any longer than necessary. There was no one and I mean, no one in this film that I cared about or even found interesting. The special effects were not even all that great. Total failure."
1,Psychotic melodrama,"I watched this movie trying to make up my own mind, following all the publicity and less than flattering pre-release reviews. Unfortunately, the movie disappointed big time. Don't get me wrong, the effects, the sound etc. are very enjoyable, but the artistic value of this movie is minimal at best. Oh yes, you have to be a real cinematographic master to screw up such a fantastic material of Wells so badly! The essence and the spirit of the original is watered down by cliche directing and the immature self-centered acting by Tom Cruise, who is a real drag in this movie. In my view, the original brilliant novel has been turned into a cheap psychotic melodrama.In short, just do yourself a favor and watch Scary Movie 4 instead..."
3,This was just so-so.,"The action and special effects for this film are on point. Thats where the three stars come into play. Everything else was abysmal. From Tom Cruise's acting to that annoying little girl I just barely sat through this cinematic blunder. Is it just me or does Cruise act the same way in everything he plays in? I'm willing to bet that it's NOT just me. I think I liked him better when he played in that tired children's movie ""Legend"". But getting back to this film I think it was grossly over-hyped and it really set the audience up for a big disappointment. Sorry, but all the couch-jumping in the world couldn't save this film from mediocrity. All in all, this film was a lukewarm mess."
2,"I dont know what movie YOU were watching, but.......","ugh! yikes! where do i begin?TERRIBLE film! horrible! no character development, basic weak plot that left no emotional investment. all it is, is blowing things up! speilberg never should have the shown the aliens, they were laughable at best!This film first problem is with the script. some actors can take even the most utter crap, and turn it into mediocre watchable stuff. no one in this film can do this! Tom might be able to LEARN, considering his Fiancee is the always amazing Katie Holmes. everyone else is basically screwed. Dakota Fanning could have really done well, considering the pressure of a life and death situation, but she just screamed and i wanted to club her! she was the biggest baby! disappointing, because she's best young actress of our time, and to see such a terrible performance, was disheartening.just a mess of a film!"
2,Too much Cruise,We could have benefited from a few more perspectives other than Cruise and his very annoying children. I give it two stars for some of the CGI otherwise very poor story.
2,YAWN,"If your looking for a thrilling,Steven Spielberg summer movie,this isn't the one. The film starts off well,but after the first 4o min, it begins to loose steam,FAST. After the that, I couldn't wait for the movie to end. Seems like the exciting summer films that Spielberg used to make are over, at least with this one. It's not very thrilling,scary, or exciting, and the plot, to say the least, is pointless, leaves alot of holes, and leaves you wanting more (or maybe not). The preview looked exciting, but the film is utterly BORING."
5,War of the Worlds,"I generally like the first movie better than the second, but this is an exception--I like this version just as much, and Cruise (and everybody) did a good job. It brings you to the edge of depression and loss, then gives you your hope back. Good brinksmanship."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"If you love special effects you may love this movie. If you love decent acting, logical plots you'll hate this movie. I hated this movie with a passion. Cruise is reduced to his acting consisting of shouting his kid's names over and over. The ending is so crass and Hollywood that when all the evidence is that his son was dead of course he isn't.I loved the original movie. This is a travesty."
2,Didn't I see this already,This movie is an amazing display of what special affects can do. Outside of that this movie is aweful. Wanting to make this quick the last part about this movie is that it is the same as Independence Day. The smilarities are amazing. I know that probably means that Independence was a rip-off of the War of the Worlds book but maybe they should have held off with this movie instead.
1,Whata heck?,"Very unrealistic, badly written and plotholes galore.... you would think the movie was directed by Geogre Lucas. As ING commercial says. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Just Awful!,"Awful, Awful, Awful! Lousy acting, lousy script & bizarre ending. Whiny kids & jerk father had me wishing they would all be exterminated after 15 minutes. Hard to believe Spielberg put his name to this train wreck. Expected much more. One star for special effects only. Did I mention it was awful?"
2,Spielberg's Worst,"This movie is just a sequence of special effects scenes intertwined with a ludicrous and nonsensical story line. Even considering it's sci-fi, this movie relies extraordinarily on it's audience to ignore inconsistencies, contradictions, and improbabilities.It's sad to see such a master of film in Spielberg turn out such a piece of junk. Based on the relatively positive reviews from the media, it's also a testament to the power he has to sway reviewers, regardless of the quality of the movie.Don't make the mistake I did, find something else to watch!"
4,Great movie for all intense purposes!!!,"Awesome...that is what I have to say about this movie!! Speilberg and company do it again with this latest adaptation of War of the Worlds, which H. G Wells wrote at the turn of the 19th century. All seems quiet for this town in New Jersey, when aliens come to visit and reak havoc on the townspeople, destroying everything in their path, including the people themselves...ever see someone evaporate to dust and disappear?? Kinda cool!!! Great effects, great storyline. Actors abilities in this one are on par with most other movies, but you will not see this one get Oscars, or any other high prestige award...this is just a fun film that you can allow yourself to watch, and be in awe. Tom Cruise, War of the Worlds was not glib at all!!"
2,Literary study only,"In trying to keep a very open mind in regards to this movie, I was very dissapointed. I feel Spielberg could have done much better if he would have introduced some scientific facts to the movie as was in the novel and in the 1953 version. More could have been shown during the battle scenes. The graphics and Spielbergs version were excellent. The really outstanding part of the whole movie was the Grandparents, Gene Barry and Ann Robinson, who stared in the original 1953 version, a good move on Spielbergs part. All in all the movie could have been much much better, especially with todays technology and advancements in the film industry."
4,War of the Worlds : 2005,"Good movie. Tom Cruise was a good actor, along with his children, and the storyline was great. It all just seemed a bit elaborate, and the ending was....... well it could have been better. But sure, this movie is definately worth seeing. There were some scary images, but all in all it was fine. Atleast rent it, I would say.Enjoy!"
3,It's so so ok,"I like the 1953 version better. It just didnt grab me like the original one did and still does. I bought this,but wished i seen it first,i wouldnt have."
1,Best with the sound turned off,"The special effects are stunning, but the plot was an insult. It featured a father who could not stay married, a little girl who's main tactic was screeching, and a boy who did his best to get killed. Apparently stupidity lets you fall in icewater and spend the night in wet clothes without ill effect. The father kills a character who gave him food and shelter because the character showed some initiative - wanted to attack the aliens where they were vulnerable. The movie featured EMP effects that could take out a starter solenoid, but did not affect delicate engine management computers or cell phones. All gun use was shown to be suicidal or criminal. The good guys won because they were photogenic. Watching grass grow would be a lot less irritating."
1,Pathetic,"This movie totally SUCKED! The original is much better even though this one has the big boomy special effects. Good thing too, cuz that's about all it had going for it! The acting sucked. The little girl needed smacked big time! God! That screaming was nerve grating! (I think the movie could have done without that.) I'm dissapointed that I spent a buck 99 to rent it! I want my money back!"
1,What?,"I went to the theater to see this, and was very disappointed. The original is 10 times better! It even is more suspenseful! The story line was very poor. The foul language ruined it, and I certainly would not reccommend it.Also, in the original, the people all go to the church for refuge, and in this version the church is the first building you see get destroyed! Awful."
2,Terrible Quality,This is no homage to the movie on blu ray as the quality is grainy and the disc and is a waste of money. Terribly disappointed!
1,Terrible Ending. Spoiler Alert!,"Alright, so we have an alien race with superior intelligence. They have the technology to travel accross the universe and have been planning to invade Earth for hundreds if not thousands of years. Yet they don't understand the concept of microorganisms and disease. Speilberg must not think much of his audience if he expects us to buy that. What a copout."
2,"Not enough alien images, good graphics, poor direction.","I was very disappointed in this adaptation of the 1953 classic. It's all about the graphics and the aliens for my son and me but we felt cheated. The movie follows Tom Cruise around as he runs and runs while the real action and what I wanted to see was outside. In one scene jets fire missiles at the aliens but it all happens out of sight. What a shame to waste all this effort. We now own this DVD only because it came free in a buy-two-get-one-free sale at EA Games. We'll watch it again for the graphics but the story leaves a lot to be desired. We will always wish this movie could have been what we hoped it would be but fell way short.Given the great old 1953 version was such a classic, and this one is such a bomb, perhaps there is still room for a good remake."
2,Scientology,"It's kinda ironic that Tom Cruise, a Scientologist is in this movie. This movie is a Scientologist's nightmare! The special effects are good, but the movie is annoying."
3,Do Not Waste your Time,This movie is not worth watching. Tom Cruise on his long slide into obvilion does nothing to help this movie. The special effects are poor the entire is just not very good.
1,I Can't Believe The Good Reviews!,"Thank goodness I only paid $3.99 on pay-per-view for this catastrophe! Way too much Tom Cruise, and too little suspense. OK, I am an old man (60), but give me the original 1953 version any day. It was extremely suspenseful, the aliens much more believable, and the story did not center nearly as much on the individuals. What a bad storyline."
2,Could have been...,"This movie could have been a contender! The effects are great, but the characters are really bad. Half way through the movie, you almost end up rooting for the tri-pods because the writing in the movie is so bad. Here's a good drinking game: take a shot each time the little girl screams. You'll be drunk before long."
2,"Wow, another steamy pile from spielberg and cruise","Sorry, after minority report, which actually looked great compared to this performance of cruise, i didn't think it could get worse...yeah, it did. I didn't rank a one because it was a classic story, and the action was ok at times, but Crazy Cruise was just a stinker in it. I just didn't care for his performance. I can't help expecting every time tom cruise opens his mouth to expect to hear ""show me the money"". I was hoping spielberg would have cast an unknown in this spot, or someone that could look a bit more grubby, more manly, cruise still looks like a kid. Definitely not the original radio brodcast. Tim Robins did a fair job, I would have liked to see him in the main character roll than cruise. Catch this one on TV, HBO or something, or rent it if you must, just not my collection type movie though. I know my review is taking a beating, but I just didn't care for this movie."
3,so-so,"I was a little disappointed in the story line itself. Some of the things going on were far fetched and didn't make sense. Amazing how everyone around them are blown up but not this family!! I realize that you're going to have a ""hero"" in the movie but for ALL of them to survive? eh-as I said far fetched. I didn't care for Tom Cruise but than I don't usually care for him. I thought the graphics were alright but probably something to be seen on the big screen! I was expecting more from S. Spilberg but nonetheless, it's not something that I would RUN OUT for but it's not something that I would really say pass it up either!!"
4,awsome movie wish they wouldnt of made a 2 disc,"This is one friggin awsome film. Great acting spectacular effects. But when I recieved this movie an I put it in. I saw their was only one extra feature. ""Designing the Enemy Tripods & Aliens"". Its about 15 minutes long its very intresting. But once its over all you have is the film. I absolutley hate it when they have a single disc dvd with one or sometimes nothing on it. Then they have a $30-35.00 2 disc movie. Thats sometimes hard to find (Batman Begins). What I think is that they should have 1 dvd with all the extra features they want in it. Leave it at that an call it a day."
1,YUK!!!!,"To get the bad taste out of my mouth, I had to pop the original DVD into my player after suffering through what seemed like six hours with this HORRIBLE remake!! If I could give it 0 stars, I would. Don't waste your money."
3,A Run-Of-The-Mill Spielberg/Cruise Formula Movie,"Cruise needs to vary his acting technique. I know what he's going to say and how he's going to react the moment the scene begins! I can even anticipate his facial expressions. There's no surprises here, none. That's the problem. We have great special effects with bland acting and ho-hum direction, just another BIG budget Spielberg production hoping to capitalize on Cruise's name. Although the movie is not not a total stinker, it's medeocre. Considering the awesome amount of money spent on this movie, H.G. Wells deserved something better. Rent it; don't buy it. As an alternative I recommend buying the DVD, ""Riddick Trilogy"" (Pitch Black/ The Chronicles of Riddick), which is off-beat and has at least a few surprises."
3,"Entertaining movie, but not true to the book","I enjoyed the movie, but like many other novels brought to the big screen, it didn't do the author justice. A movie is never as good as the book, especially a classic like War of the Worlds.I thought the special effects were great, and i was thoroughly entertained.As for the quality of the dvd, i was somewhat disappointed. The picture looked grainy in some shots. I have a samsung lcd hdtv (1080P) with an upconvert DVD player. some of the shots just look plain bad."
2,Leaves a lot to desire,"War of the Worlds is a visual masterpiece, but there's more to a movie the FX. The film has no plot, really bad acting and a lot of plot holes. Cruise seems annyoing (maybe because I've seen to much of him in the news), and Fanning has once again managed to be really, really annoying. About 7 years have past since Independence Day came out, but this movies seems like its ugly twin brother."
3,War of the Cruzism,"Well Tom almost sent this one straight to video. That guy whould not shut up. This movie should have had more horror. PG13 booo. One part took me out of the movie. A plane crashes into the house and the van is still in the drive way. Its a astro van. The van you always see spewing a black cloud in traffic. Look for all the current day news. Is it terrorist, a occupation never works and parents trying to protect there eager children form the fight. You do get a real good sense of the chaos and panic of the masses. Just have a few grenades if they do come."
5,Spielberg's War of the Worlds Opinion,I don't have much to say because this movie isn't in theaters yet but I do know that anything by Spielberg is a masterpiece because all of his movies are. I really liked the novel and I know I will like the movie also. I haven't seen the original version but I know that this movie will have great special effects. And it will make a lot of money. I just know it. I especially like some of the films Tom Cruise stars in. They are stupendous.
1,This movie is frickin' horrible,"I saw this with a friend because the commercial looked good. Man, was I disappointed. We laughed several times during the movie, and it's not supposed to be funny. Speilberg used to be the best director. What happened? His movies were so good that you didn't just watch them, you felt them. Now he's like his buddy George Lucas. He's lost his touch with age. This overhyped, plodding, pointless film is just another in a continuously growing line of Spielberg toilet paper. Take some money out of your wallet and wipe your a$$ with it, and you'll feel better than wasting it and your time on War of the Worlds. It's that bad."
4,War of the Worlds - Review,"Action - packed , special E-fex in place , Tom Cruise takes you thru a maze of calculated insanity......Imagine having your world ""turned upside down"" by alien ships trying to take your planet.......now its time to buy the origional with Gene Berry !"
2,Poor ending that left you feeling like Jurrasaic Park,"The premise of the this movie had potential but Steven Speilberg blew it. I felt like I was watching Jurassaic Park -- it was all so fictional. And the ending -- I don't want to ruin it for the viewer but it comes out of nowhere and typifies the Hollywood way. After two hours of a bleak and insurmountable fight, everything somehow ends up ok in the end."
3,"Hokey, Cheesy Summer Flick","War of the Worlds lacked plot logic, but it was very entertaining nevertheless. The special effects were great and the acting was believable. I actually felt for the characters, which is always a good thing.With that said, the movie is essentially a summer extravaganza which in turn makes it a feast for the eyes not the brain. In short, it was cheesy and lacking plot plausibility. I won't get into the details of why the plot flat-out sucked (I'm not a spoiler), but suffice it to say that things don't add up in the end.One good moral out of this film: occupation never wins."
1,What a Mess,Possibly one of the worst movies of the year. The combined talents of Speilberg and Cruise amount to less than adequate. To take an excellent Wells story and turn it into this trash is a disgrace.
1,No story,Where's the story line??? It appeared Tom and his kids spent the 2 hours running from NY to Boston. The 1953 version with Gene Barry and Ann Robinson is far superior.
2,Big Disappointment,"Being a big fan of the original 1950's movie version, I was immensely disappointed with this ""dumbed down"" modern version of this classic story. Missing were the interesting and thought provoking scientific and religious themes of the original version. The protagonist, instead of being a curious and brave scientist, is dumbed down to a blue collar worker whose only interest is in protecting his children. Spielberg no doubt thought that this would add more drama to appeal to the masses, but instead it makes the plot boring and tedious, especially for adult audiences."
4,Riveting Remake,"Most people know the plot of H.G. Well's novel and the original sci fi movie classic. The new War of the Worlds is extremely impressive. It was much better than I expected it to be. Watching the events unfold, you feel as if you were there. The special effects are the best I have seen in any movie. Tom Cruise is a great actor. With the combination of superlative special effects, directing, sound, and acting, you feel every emotion that Tom Cruise's character feels.War of the Worlds is best viewed on the biggest screen possible, with surround sound.I would give it five stars, but towards the end, the story gets very thin. Our view and understanding of aliens has evolved so much since the original radio broadcast, that there could have been a better reason for the aliens wanting to take over the Earth and to kill humans."
2,a poor ending makes for a bad movie!,"I thoroughly enjoyed MOST of this movie, but it ended so poorly that I left the theater feeling rather disappointed. This is really too bad, because the movie starts off well and the storyline does a great job of building suspense. Tom was pretty good in his role, although I've seen better performances from him in other movies. Dakota Fanning was fabulous. The special effects were fine, nothing really new, but not bad. Just not exceptional. But the ending! After building you up to expect a big climax, it just poops out. I left the theater asking myself and others: What's the point?"
4,Less Flaws and more entertaining than the Average Summer Blockbuster,"H.G. Wells has been served far better than anyone has any right to expect.Spielsberg has created a cautionary tale about Imperialism and our complacency in the dominance over our affairs, and given us a great ""Chase movie"". While characterization is slight, and there are nits to be found everywhere, the movie strikes balances of horror, terror, and enough breathing space to keep the audience primed for the next inhumanity.Tripods! Death Rays! Irredeemably evil Aliens! And Cruise doesn't even save the world, although he does a lot better than many of his compatriots. The ending, and the defeat of the Aliens is completely true to the source material.Bring the popcorn and get ready for the ride."
4,GREAT portrayal of father's COURT-APPOINTED visit w/SNOTTY KIDS!!!,Fanning as precocious preteen daughter and teen son (Justin Chatwin) work with Cruise for beautifully believable portrayal of a blue-collar overgrown teen's visit by kids over the WEEKEND FROM HELL.H.G. Wells legendary story provides backdrop for excellent portrayal of the stress between NON-CUSTODIAL PARENT and RESENTFUL snotty spoiled brats.
1,It was ok,The movie was good. But I couldn't tell if it was Blu ray or not. The clarity was bad. Didn't look HD
4,Good Movie,This was a good movie adaptation of the original. I generally don't care for remakes but this is an exception. The only thing that would have made this better is if the lead role would have been played by someone other Tom Cruise.
1,I was torn....,"..about whether or not to even see this movie. Cruise is just like nails on chalk board, but Speilberg is a master of entertainment.After living through this film -- well half of it anyway -- I can assure you of two things: (1) I'll never watch anything else by Cruise, who is becoming a charicature of himself in every role, no matter who else is stupid enough to work with him and (2) Speilberg will know better than to ever do so again."
2,Expected more,"I expected more out of this film- Spielberg and Cruise gave expectations that. Unfortunatelly this remake fell short. Althought visual effects were decent, I felt that the screenplay did not provide the stars with enough of a story in order to please the audience. It was not a box office hit and that says a lot especially when it had names like Spielberg and Cruise behind it. However if you do not have high expectations, this film is watchable."
3,Pretty cool...,"The sound in this movie as well as the visual effects is what makes this worth viewing. If you like sci-fi flicks, then you need to have this. What I like most about this film is that there isnt an attempt to understand why extraterrestrials want to invade. They just invade!"
1,Shame on you Hollywood (once again)!,This film is probably one of the worst films ever made! Even 'Mac and Me' was better than this garbage. Clear evidence that not even Spielberg himself could save a horrendous script. Anybody that gave this film more than 1 star needs their head re-examined. Nothing more that needs to be said than that.
2,Blu-ray transfer is a huge disappointment!,I have to completely agree with many other reviewers on the Blu-ray version of War of the Worlds. I was very anxious to bring home my new $25 copy only to be highly disappointed as the movie began. The graininess is very distracting and a complete turn off for me. The sound though is still on par for DTS and excellent in all aspects. I should have better spent the $25 on something else more worthy. There is no good excuse for not having put forth a better effort for the ultimate transfer that this movie greatly deserves. Buyers beware!
2,Truly a Waste,"After a terrific first hour, the film just nosedives and never resurfaces. Tom Cruise is the last person you cast as an everyman because he's Tom Cruise and is only successful at playing Tom Cruise. Tim Robbins doesn't fare much better with his overacting; his presence is even more of a detriment. And don't get me started on the God-awful ""love conquers all"" ending. What a waste of Steven Spielberg's talent."
1,A huge disapointment,"This movie is completely rubbish. People who might be tempted to view this movie because of Jared Martin's ""War of the worlds"" TV series are bound to be disapointed.Rather than buying this DVD, i would suggest buying a DVD of Jared Marstin's TV series."
1,Bad Moive,This Moive is so bad who would give it five stars. I went to see this moive because it had good people in it. It was bad however. Do not buy this moive tust me. If you need a good moive buy Star wars but do not get this. This had a lot o hype but did not do will at the moives.
1,A waste of my time and yours!,"When I was only an hour into this film, I knew it was a disaster! It's just boring!!! Plain dull UN-believable and boring. The movie takes way too long to develop its plot; it just goes on and on and on and on. And Tom Cruise's kids are not believable. Dakota, the little girl, screams in a very fake way in a couple of scenes. Unfortunately, it's too forced. The kids as a whole, are more annoying than anything and their acting is not up to par! There are many nice ""visuals"" and these tend to drag on too long. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the citizens are shown like a million times! Enough! We know they are there! Now, get to the plot. I expected so much better from Spielberg. Perhaps it's time for him to go back to the drawing board. We come to expect better of him and I hope he reads these reviews on this movie! Spielberg, get it right next time!"
2,BORE OF A WAR!!!!,"When I first heard this movie was coming, I was excited. I expected it to be as good as the first, maybe better. I ignored the hoopla surrounding Tom Cruise and scientology, and hoped the movie would succeed in spite of it.Unfortuantely, the movie does not. It starts out all right. The scenes of the alien tripod creatures obliterating Americaare impressive, the scenes involving the refugees were equally intense. All good things come to an end, though, and mid-way the movie winds down. When the action picks up again, you know that Cruise will be the hero of the day until the microbes prove themselves bigger heroes of the day.Perhaps the main thing working against the movie, though, is its being a re-make. Almost every science fiction fan in existence has seen the first War of the Worlds, giving the second movie a ""been there, done that"" feeling.If special effects turn you on, see this at the big screen. Otherwise, I recommend waiting until it hits the DVDs or Comcast."
3,Where is the original War of the Worlds or something close,"Why were we given the impression that this was a remake of theoriginal War of the Worlds? This was truly a Spielberg/Cruz movie,the effects give it that. I found it hard to keep up with Cruz,in a believable way. If you have ever seen the original it was great for its time, but all this movie has is the special effects and then that's a stretch. The only part that is remotely close is when the eye comes in searching for life and nearly finds Cruz. Ifelt let down, where were the scientist trying to save the world. Oh and whats with all the blood?"
1,Hollywood throw up.,"Hearing so much of how this movie was to be the movie of the decade has jaded me a bit because I spent so much money seeing this in the theater with my family and feel so jipped out of my money. It looks totally unfinished and what's with the appearing and disappearing long poncho on Dakota Fanning?? I'm certain this movie was shot without a complete script and it wouldn't surprise me to find out Speilberg and Cruise never even read the classic novel. Too many facts are wrong or off in this film. It is uneven and rushed and what the H2@#! I expect more from such an allegedly expensive movie. The independent War of the Worlds movies are MUCH better and more entertaining and I highly recommend saving your money here and checking out the classic Victorian movie version instead. Let's hope Spielberg gets his head screwed on in the future and makes something we can all be proud of, like the original Jaws. Buyers beware here because this movie is a pooper and not one to be proud of."
4,Not bad afterall!,"I actually liked this movie enough to give it 4 stars. It is different than the original classic but not in the overall story. The fx are excellent and the pace keeps up quite well. There are problems however; the movie tends to lose it's steams about 2 thirds of the way in and it kind of stalls out a little. the basement sequence is a bit too long and the story is centered way too much on the three main characters. Also the end is a little sort of rushed and lame, in the original movie the aliens died just before distroying the only building left standing (the church) where the survivors took refuge, that adds to the end as saying that faith in god saved us from death, but in this remake there is no similar message that, to my opinion, would have given the movie a deeper meaning. Overall: PRETTY GOOD."
1,Terrible! Something unexpected from Spielberg.,"This movie is terrible. Only when I saw the Director's commentary in 'Special Features' I found out that the aliens caught flu/cold. It is hard to understand movie. Tom Cruise yells ""The Shield"" towards the end of the movie and then the spaceship is attcked with javelins. Given Tom cruise's interest in automobile repairs earlier in the movie it sounded like he had found a fault in some windshield of the spaceship or something. But NO it was the flu virus that saved the earth. Thanks. Tom Cruise's acting is terrible. He has a cute face but certainly he is not an actor. Direction is awful.Don't waste your time on this one."
1,War of the Worlds flop,"Ok don't get me wrong I loved the idea and the theory in the movie. The plot was just great. And the idea. But the actors sucked, that little girl I think she just got the job if she could she she was whiney enough. As far as character flow as in they are a family I sure didn't see it at all. Tom Cruise acted through the whole film as just an actor didn't really make me feel like he was tryint to 'get into' the part at all. Just readin lines from a card. And 3/4 way through the movie the son takes off after the aliens and ya never see him again till the end. What did he do? When the militarty was gettin blowin up he made it through? It made no sense. A remake in 2 years with good actors and I'd give it 5 stars if it kept the same storyline. If ya think of renting this have your buddy pay for it. Or go in half cause it's sure not worth full price."
3,War of the special effects,"This movie had my expectations raised, after all it was a blockbuster with big stars and Spielberg. The special effects were great, but for plot I preferred the George Pal version. True, this is closer to the novel in content, with a hundred year update. I did not really care what was happening to the characters. It was OK but not what I expected."
3,Of course it's not a bad movie...,"...with Spielberg behind the wheel, but I must say that I expected more. I haven't red the book, but I hear it's not as good as it is known to be (I've actually heard that from a lot of people, though I know it's a classic -so relax!). It's never boring, but it never reached a climax. That was actually my biggest surprise. Tom Cruise is really great, but acting in this kind of movie can't make up for that. It's actually not that much from the movie I remember, and it was nearly out of my mind the day after me and my friends went to see it in the theatre. No real ""remembarable"" scenes, not nearly a classic.Perhaps it deserves a second look though, some movies requires that."
2,No Science in Science Fiction,"One thing that the movie lacks is a focus on science in the context of science fiction. The earlier WOTW film had a focus on the science of science fiction. Strange for Spielberg because he has done work on Apollo 13 and seemed to respect the science. The film mirrors our culture's loss of interest in science at the same time we see cuts in science budgets, religious disapproval of stem cell research, and dishonesty in editing scientific environmental reports in Washington."
2,The original film was better.,"Yes, I know it was ""originally"" an Orson Welles radio broadcast, but I did not experience that. The 1953 Byron Haskin version of the film was much better (theatrically)than the modern version. I particularly don't like the fact that nearly every remake these days is centered around a family from a broken home, the children hate the father (even on the verge of certain death) and the father-figure can't act.Why two stars? Aside from the material of the remake being a disappointment, the visual effects didn't always work either. Blame it on the compositing and lighting, because Tom Cruise's character did not blend with the background, especially whe it was needed the most. I can go on, but I already wasted 2 hours in the theater watching this film, so I don't want to waste any more time writing a review of it. Save your money, wait for the DVD and rent it instead."
4,Better than I expected,"I was more than surprised by this film. I was expecting to get an overly preachy, optimistic Spielberg story, and was treated to a grim, dark, end of the world film. I loved the 1953 film, and thought this stayed true to that. I found the tripods to be terrifying, but the crowd scenes to be horrorific. Spielberg also pays tribute to Close Encounters, Independence Day, and the 1953 film. These are not humorous asides to the audience, but subtle clues woven in the terror.This film should win techmical effects oscars, and Dakota Fanning should be on the best supporting actress bill."
3,War of the Words,"I think that War of the Worlds was an amazing special effects movie. The aliens couldn't have been done better! This movie has lots of language, lots of violence, and some bad acting. (Violence? really? War of the Worlds?) I didn't like the rebellious kids' acting. It got annoying with the bad family relationship, which never completely heals in the end. I get sick of movies with family fighting with little point to it. However, this movie does excel in the action aspect. It's for this exciting and tense aspect that I saw it twice. Probably won't watch it again though."
3,Great Special Effects Poor Story and Ending,"This movie has great special effects, but the story line is kind of lacking. The two annoying kids in the movie really start to get on your nerves. I also did not like the fact that when the movie depicts the Army fighting the aliens you never actually see what the soldiers are firing at. You never see the numerous tanks, fighter jets, and helicopters firepower hit anything. Its like they are shooting at nothing. The worst part of the movie is the very weak ending. This movie was a major disappointment, despite its being fairly new and filled with special effects. This movie was the worst one I have seen in a while."
4,Entertainment!,"This film reeks of all that is good in film. The actors are forgettable in this film, this doesn't take from the value of the film though. Forget the comparisons to the other films. Forget the novel. This film will smack you in the face. It's fun and chocked full of great effects. Cruise is the ONLY actor that makes this film believable. Spielberg's direction is impeccable. I'm not a fan or Cruise or Speilberg, but his pairing works."
2,Too much publicity,"The special effects ...AwesomeThey actually had little mistakes. Like...all the electricity was gone, even phone, clocks, blah blah...but The videocamera was working , even the digital cameras :o, how were they taking pictures if machines weren't working? :| weird (Maybe I'm wrong, sorry).Why did aliens attacked earth not knowing if the ambient they were going to enter was good for them? Its like sending US soldiers to mars with no suits before knowing if they gonna be ok or not.I think they didn't knew how to end the movie. Cause the ending was really short.Maybe it needed more alien machines, we just saw 1 :| that gets kinda boring.Needed more alien infantry, more action, not just some big alien machine shooting everybody.But special effects and sound were damn great, the intro is damn cool."
2,"Grain, Grain, Go Away","Yes, motion picture film has grain but it is seldom visible as such in the theater.Yes, this Blu-ray has grain and it is very visible throughout."
1,Very poor,"American movie making at it's worst!Tom Cruise plays Tom Cruise.Stephen Spoilberg re-writes a story simply to pepper a movie with his now tiresome and predictable 'special effects' - and again an English story has to be re-located in the US - Very lame!The result is poor white trash.Even Fanny Dakota is looking old - perhaps she should retire now before she gets type cast! Oh, sorry - Too late!Better to buy Jeff Wayne's muscal version or War of The Worlds.Play it loud, close your eyes - Now you have a good movie!"
2,Just read the H.G. Wells novel,"This movie lacks the sophistication and depth from the book and the 1951 original film. Yeah, Spielberg did a fine job with the suspense and the visual effects looked amazing, but Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning were badly miscast (it was quite irritating to hear Fanning just shriek and shriek and shriek...). Tim Robbins should have played the main role instead; he was just a wasted supporting character. Overall, it's just a decent movie.C+"
3,So-so,"You know the plot. Alien invade Earth.THE GOOD-If Speilburg wanted to scare people, he sure scared me.-The acting is pretty good.-The special effects are awesome.THE BAD-WHY did the aliens attack Earth? They don't seem to have a reason this time.-The film is illogical. Why didn't the idiot humans just hide underground? The aliens didn't look there. Why didn't the aliens get sick and die when they buried they're tripods on Earth before the dawn of man?-The aliens are pretty goofy looking this time.-Dakota Fanning does three times as good as Cruise does.-The writing sucks.Overall, you should go watch the original instead."
2,Special affects will only go so far.,"I thought Cruise's character was shallow and inarticulate and his family was no treasure either. The story was meant to depict his inner journey from blue-collar jerk to commited family man as the invasion progresses, but there isn't one well-written, convincing conversation in the whole film and I couldn't care less about these people. This shows just how good 'Independence Day' really was - and this from the man who made 'Close Encounters', a truly great film.Other than the thrill of all the terrific special effects on the screen this film is a waste of time. It's a machine built to make money with no heart or charm. Spielberg is a great artist, but here he's just a great craftsman and I'm surprised he put his name on this hollow clunker. Thumbs down."
2,Just like the 1950's version...,"...this movie is not true to the novel. Therefore, we still do not have a viable movie version of ""The War of the Worlds"". Peter Jackson and his team of writers should take it on...they obviously *know* how to adapt novels to screen.And one word to Steven Spielberg: From now on, no more children in your movies. You must swear off having children in your movies for at least 5 years, or until you have shown that you know how to do it without so much saccharin sentimentality. (If I saw Tom Cruise cover Dakota Fanning's eyes one more time, I know I would have puked!) ""The War of the Worlds"" is not a children's book, and should not be a children's movie."
1,Worst film Ive seen in years,"It's not even a good ""B"" movie....Now the first 20 mins are OK and the lighting is great throughout, however, after the first 20mins the film rapidly goes downhill, becoming dull, predictable and can I say ""Boring"", oh and the ending caps it .... worse than 100% predictable!I imagine most have forgotten that the ""original"" adaptation was a Radio play, narrated by Orson Welles, broadcast in the Thirty's.Now that version caused mass panic, as people tuned in expecting to hear the usual ""radio play"" sometime after the opening announcement and thought it were really happening.......now that version is still bone chilling to hear, even to this day, its available free online and is really worth listening to....(Hey Amazon how about some negative stars?... I wouldn't give it a negative five, but certainly a negative something)"
1,Useless on a laptop,I to watch my DVD's on my laptop and what I assume is some form of anti-copying protection causes the movie to halt and stutter so much that it is completely unviewable. I know it isn't the laptop because I can put one of my older DVD's in and view it with no probems whatsoever.
1,Exploitive cash cow movie. An embarrassment to all involved.,"If you put together some greedy people, give them some recycled aliens, no story, one small set, a has been star and the CGI from the old Anaconda movie and you've got the end result called ""TOM CRUISE IN"" waroftheworlds. Thousands say otherwise, being as their lives and jobs depend on it. Non linear, non sensible waste of time."
1,brain damage,"i am really suprised as to how a talented director like Spielberg make such a dumb movie. It was ridiculous, absolute waste of time and money. The kids were the most irritating part of the movie, I wish the aliens ate them in the begining of the movie, atleast that would have saved their annoying characters."
2,War,"Could I be wrong in feeling that War of the World contained one of the most desturbing themes I have seen in a Spielberg movie?With the current events in the world being as troubling as they are , it doesn't supprise me that more movies like this one contain more than a few overt references to 9/11, terrorists, an forced ocupations. That is not what disturbes me. What did disturb me was the underlying messege mixed in with these in a few scenes that 'sometimes you have to turn on your fellow man to save yourself and your own family/people.'In no part was this more apparent than in the ""blindfold"" scene. What in every other decent story would be seen as coldblooded and premeditated murder carried out by someone of low moral character is here passed off as a neccessary action carried out by the hero figure.After this scene I found it virtually impossible to enjoy the movie."
4,A great film but could have better better,"One of the most anticipated movies of the year War of the worlds is a great movie but I thought it could of been better. There are many flaws witht eh movie first thing is the ending it was way to corney and I mean corney it kind of ruiend the whole movie, andother thing I am not a fan of Tom Cruise and he's in every scene. I got passes all the bad things and found the ovie great. the story is good, the acting was good I thought Dakota Fanning great, the special effects where great and the direction. Overall it's one of the best films of the year and should not dispaoint you."
3,Not bad at all,"I won't going into to much details on wether the conversion from book to movie was as crisp and clean as it could have been i find that Trivial at this stage this movie was a big budget film and the stars was also high profiled the special effects was intense and ifind myself asking ummmmmh this version wasn't so bad after all it had some really humorous moments and some really intense ones also , spielberg was great and tom cruise was of course tom cruise, the movie isnt on my classic list but its entertaining and worth a view or the destruction is like one of those end of the world dream, that have you runninig for your life, ummmh! it was an end of the world movie after all wasn't it??? no complaints here i will leave the bashing for the intellect so laterz folks."
1,:( pooh,"Wow, this was a let down. Went right out and bought it thinking it was going to be more like what the commercials led it to be. We all thought it was going to be more of us fighting the aliens or something more... It was good that the movie had some great acting stars, or it would have been simply unbearable to watch. Parts were good, but I hadn't expected to pay good money to watch us getting sucked through an alien straw."
3,cool special effects,"This movie had very cool special effects, but mediocre acting(could have done without the screaming child).My joke for this movie came when they showwed one of the martian machines destroying a town and I said,""there should be a bumper sticker on the back that says 'hows my destruction?call 1-800-udie-die'"""
4,Good movie,I liked the movie very much. The effects and story line are well put together. There is also a good since of realism involved here. Tom is a great actor and has delivered every time in every movie he has been in. I like his ability to make his character believable; you never get the felling that he is the same person he played in a previous film.
3,H G Wells afficianado,"Read the book or listen to the original Orson Wells recording to get the real deal! Special effects of this movie were spectacular and it is worth watching, but for the real deal follow the linksWar of the Worlds-Original Radio Broadcast 30 Octo,The War of the Worlds - Original Broadcast,The War of the Worlds"
3,"Okay as an action movie, I guess","Takes some of the ideas from the H.G. Wells science fiction classic and uses them to provide the action (and the gore) for a Tom Cruise action romp. If that's what you want - a typical Cruise film, with the lead character growing up at last as he triumphs over the dangers the plot throws at him - it's fine. It held my attention just well enough so I watched the whole movie, but it was not the Wells sci-fi thriller adapted for the screen. Just a borrowing of elements from that tale to use for another purpose.A definite ""your mileage may vary"" proposition."
1,Creepshow,"I'm sorry I can't even rate this 2 stars. Beacuse of the ending and how they tried to turn it into this feel-good family reunion at the end gave me the creeps. It's like, oh everyone in your immeadiate circle JUST HAPPENED to survive....yeah right. I wanted this to be a more realistic take on what would happened if this really took place in our lifetime. They spent more time keeping Tom cruise and dakota fanning in isolation, with all of their sentimental bs. I fast forwarded when tom cruise sang that lullaby thing, sorry, don't need to hear Tom cruise sing! Dakota fanning acts to much like a self-aware adult, you just want to grab her and say, be a kid! act normal! I guess that is her normal but it's creepy. And every extra in the movie seemed to be wearing a knit cap! Creepy!"
1,i would have given it 0 stars,"This movie is so predictable it's not even funny. for example, when dakota fanning asks tom cruise to sing her the second lullaby i knew he was going to say ""sorry i don't know that one either"" PREDICTABLE! It was really annoying to hear fanning scream...and I didn't like the acting in this movie either. I still don't understand why Tom Cruise would tell Tim Robbins not to use the axe...but then later used it himself. Doesn't make sense. The special effects were ok but other than that this movie was a flop. Two thumbs way down."
2,Why Bother?,"When so much talent onscreen and off is assembled to weave a film from H. G. Wells' eternal tale of ""unsympathetic"" interplanetary visitors scouring the earth of we parasitic humans, hopes naturally run high. Yet as I struggled to make it through this hapless, explosion-laden insult to past versions of War of the Worlds, I was actually grateful for the chance to escort a young relative off for a potty break. Yep, it was that bad. All the combined undeniable talents of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg couldn't salvage this ""ruined by its horrid efforts to update it"" bit of suspense-lacking, obese-with-special effects, mistake. I like the H.G. Wells source material and I like most of those involved in this version, I only wish I had been given reason to like this movie as well. Hey, now that I've survived my twenties and can expect a long life ahead of me, I look forward to the next re-make, due out around when I turn fifty. See you there?"
2,"Ah, the screaming sent me screaming out the door.","Tom Cruise was in full Scientology inanimation. But that's beside the point, it's his only 'acting' strength. What drove me nuts was the role of the daughter who was a 9 year old hypochondriac who had a shrill scream when she was happy, when she was frightened, when she was sad, when she was startled, and when she was angry. Even the neighborhood dogs howled at every screening of this flick. Then... the role of the son, good gracious, he was ready to join the 'Army of one' abandon his family and go running after a battalion going over a hill to attack an unknown enemy. Jeez!The saving grace were the special effects. But that does not make a movie."
4,mostly entertaining,"an extremely powerful and effective sci-fi extravaganza that runs circles around other action epics such as Independence Day and Twister. War of The Worlds actually combines a good story with believable actors and stunning special effects.The only red flag with this one is the Morgan Freeman narration, which has been done so many times before - with him being the all knowing one in the background. I realize with the horse and God movies the filmmakers wanted to be so politically correct by going with Mr. Freeman. At what point does Freeman or his agent say, ""You know what, the money would be great, but we want to do something new. We're tired of the same ole' tired narration bit; and we're tiring of tiring our audiences with it."""
5,different from first,this movie is really different from the first one with Gene Berry but it is really great. They were able to do things that could not be done in the first. Even if you saw & loved the movie with Gene Berry buy this one. it is worth the money.
2,good effects popcorn sci-fi on a grainy DVD,"Good effects and intensity but the story is lame and full of holes. How come technologically advanced aliens know nothing aboutbacteria and viruses? The opening voice-over says they werewatching us for a long time...so they never heard about a common cold?That aside, the worst part was the incessant high pitch screaming from the character playing Cruise' daughter.The sound effects are excellent (high-pitched screaming not withstanding) and the alien's weapons special effects make it worth the price of the rental.Alas, the movie (and the aliens) end not with a bang but a whimper, and it's all been transferred onto a grainy, washed-out DVD."
4,Cool,I have watched the old movie and I have to say that the remake is really cool. So much better than I expected.
3,Not to shabby.,"Before I saw this movie people said to me it was OK, but not that great. Being I diehard fan of Independence Day, I prayed for something new and different. Once I saw it, it was pretty good, but not something you'd expect from Speilburg. I guess the 'Martians in the basement' sequence (being extremely similar to the Raptors in the kitchen sequence from Jurassic Park) gives away that the film is Spielburg's, and Tom Cruise could do better to play his role but otherwise this movie's pretty good. I guess it's one of those films that some people are saying ""oh, ya it's Spielburg's movie duh it's gonna be good"". All I'm saying is it's not something you'd expect from Spielburg, just so you can be a little more prepared for something completely different more than I was. 3 stars."
1,A disappointing movie with a stupid ending,"The whole movie is about Tom Cruise, along with 2 uncooperative children, running away from aliens. At the end of the movie, no one kills the aliens. They just start dying on their own. It's not clear if the aliens die from a virus or what. I found the movie not only disappointing but annoying. Fortunately, I only rented it."
2,Hollywood Drizzle,"What a letdown, I really enjoyed ""Minority Report"" but this was borderline awful. Cruise's character was so one dimensional and so dull actually he was almost unlikeable. If he was to represnt the common man in humanity then he failed. Dakota Fanning was the most annoying character I have ever encountered all she did was scream. I really did not care for the characters and did not care what happened to them. Check out Tim Robbins riduculous New Jersey accent too. The aliens were out of central casting and worst of all was the terrible and predictable Hollywood ending. I was bored and dissapointed. Spielberg is a whimp, see the ending. Can we just have on movie without Morgan Freeman too? He narrates the beginning and the end. I do not recommend it would make a good video game though."
1,Highly Overrated!,"This is the worst movie Steven Spielberg has ever made, and it proves that it takes more than special effects to make a good movie. His movie lacks a good storyline, good direction, good acting and a good commentary. The start (or opening) of the movie was somewhat weak, but the end (or closing) was a lot weaker. All in all, the 1953 version is much better than this version of The War of The Worlds."
1,i didnt like it,"these aliens drive these giant robots things and blow junk up and theyve like been here for a long time. i know, but its not as good as it sounds. its more like a soap operah with Tom cruise running around with his family the hole time and trying to keep them safe. it's like a soap oprah with aliens and robots and I don't like tom cruise anyway"
1,"Soylent Dick says: Aweful movie, aweful acting, aweful directing","I pretty much agree with all of what the negative reviews have said.The directors cannot move from one scene to another without the main protagonists shrieking - at each other, or the situation. The absurdity is increased by the special effects which only throw into further relief the woeful mess this movie is."
4,Don't expect a great ending!,"Ok, the ending is maybe touching, but it's not what I was looking for. The ending is even less spectacular than Independence Day because (spoiler) the aliens die ""naturally"" of some kind of disease they contract. However, this movie has a serious message for all humanity, and that is we are being watched by advanced extraterrestrial beings. This is what I believe (based on common sense), but unlike the other message of the movie, I don't believe that we are in any danger of them. On the contrary, I believe we are merely being watched for our development and progress. And like the movie ""Star Trek - First Contact"", when we achieve faster than light (FTL) speed, these extraterrestrials will reveal themselves. So I guess it's going to be a long wait before the answer to the question ""Are we alone?"" is truly revealed."
2,It's the End of the World As We Know It,"I was kind of disappointed. Oh, it had great special effects but I thought it was soulless. I expect better from Spielberg. Something more humanistic instead of just watching the world being destroyed."
1,Wait for this DVD to Drop to 5 bucks or less!,"The story is told in such a lousy way! We are left to guess why the aliens are invading or killing the humans. Why wait thousands of years to resurface? The end is ridiculous, totally lacking in imagination. The high tech stuff is second grade; we have seen this in many many previous films before. Some ""suspense"" parts such as alien camera searching for humans was already seen in previous work by Spielberg, better. I would only buy this movie for $5, or watch it on TV. Major disapointment!!!"
2,Bad DVD Video Quality for a film like this.,"The film is not bad, storly could had been alot better if just edit a few scene, i must said the acting of this is true 5 star perfomance, especially the girl amazing perfomance, might be best actrees someday. Visual Effect is quite good, but not amzing, plot is somehow awkward, DVD lack alot of stuff, i mean u basically just getting the movie, commertary that's about it , i was expect quality of the film shall be better but no, is actually worst, just like hero, video encoder not doing good job this one, alot of flaw u can see easly."
2,Obnoxious kids are much scarier than aliens!,"The original 1950's version of Orson Welles' classic tale still strikes me as more the thing wanted -- despite the blubbering, shrieking presence of a future wifey-poo, who somehow manages to cook the hero a thumping good breakfast amid the carnage! The present release is hampered by a disposable subplot pitting a immature blue-collar divorced dad vs snotty teenage son and relentlessly self-centered, shrilly screaming tween daughter -- if he'd fed the latter to the aliens from the git-go, they'd have fled home within seconds with their whosits between their whatevers! As a matter of fact, most of the humans seem to have escaped from one of Stephen King's less subtle unattractive-weirdo-a-thons. But the effects are worth seeing (once) even if, judging by the otherwise admirably restrained soundtrack, every single one of the aliens played tuba in Martian High School."
2,the radio play was better and it's ~70 years old,"The title says it all: this movie was horrid.Instead of a story this movie serves up a heaping helping of family drama against a backdrop of laser-beam wielding, giant robot piloting, blood-draining aliens. Yay aliens - boo wooden family drama. I'm glad we saw one man's struggle to protect his children (not,) now I'd like to see the rest of the damn story."
1,Worst Remake I have seen,"This movie is terrible. Save your time and money, buy the 1953 version. This movie has the tri-pods having been put here a millon years ago. DUHHH. If they had been here to place them, why didthey not know the microbs would kill them? In fact, why did'nt they just stay while there was no resistance? The entire movie is full of this type of WTFs. The special effects are great, the movie is not."
2,"This Blu-ray DVD is substandard, very grainy and washed out","You can take or leave the movie. I think it's kind of so-so.Having seen it in the theater and as the owner of many Blu-ray DVDs, I was shocked at how terrible this film is on Blu-ray.This is the WORST Blu-ray I own, and I refer to the quality not the movie content.The picture is often washed out, it is grainy, it totally lacks the kind of detail one expects to see with Blu-ray. I would say this is at the level of watching it on a CRT TV from a VHS player.This product was totally disappointing. I'd advise you to just purchase it on regular DVD as there is no qualitative difference with the Blu-ray product."
3,disappointed,"I have been waiting a long time for this movie to be released on blu ray. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. It is grainy and the only noticable difference from regular dvd is the sound effects. I have a top of the line system so don't try to point the finger there. It is the quality. POOR!! Like i said only sound is different, picture the same quality as regular dvd, don't wast your $$$$"
2,"Big, Loud, Boring, and Stupid....","Amazing amount of talent expended for such a weak outcome. About the only thing going for this film are the special effects. The ""first"" alien tripod encounter does show the film's potential, but, very quickly the whole thing disintegrates into a mess of bad acting (I am so sick of Tom Cruise), implausible story situations (the entire plane crash sequence), and just generally uninteresting filmmaking (1/4 of the film in a basement). Once again, illustrating Hollywood's belief, that if something is just big and loud enough, it will sell tickets. One would expect much more from Speilberg and his talented crew here. Very, very disappointing!"
4,on saying goodbye,"His muzzle is turning white, his fur isn't as thick as it used to be, and his howl now as a few tremors in it, but Old Coyote's memory is as sharp as ever. He can recall when there wasn't any city near his home, and there were no highways with cars breaking speed limits.Since he can't run the way he used to Old Coyote sort of ambles along thinking about the past. He returns to the den where he lives with Mrs. Coyote. Together they think of their children and grandchildren, all 129 of them! But, he aches, he hurts. He knows he's grown old.In the way of all coyotes he tells Mrs. Coyote that he will be soon going off. She understands, and licks him on the nose.This tender tale about living a full life and then saying goodbye will help youngsters understand what the final goodbye means. It's a simple story beautifully illustrated in mixed media on paper.- Gail Cooke"
5,Great product,It tastes great and mixes pretty well. I think it is true about the slower releasing protein because I'm not hungry for a while after I eat it. Some other protein shakes are absorbed faster and I am hungry within an hour. This is also the best tasting protein shake I've ever tried. Great product!!!
1,Change Review --As bitter as beer,I must have had a bad batch as the replacement Pro-Rated bag has no problems and is as advertised. I use it after biking 50-100 miles as a protein replacement. I would change the review to 5 stars if the editor allowed.
3,bad toys!,"I bought this toy 2 years ago. It looked great put together, but broke the first time I flew it. Good thing it came with a second set of wings, but they broke too. I ordered replacement wings and they broke. So, what I am getting at is, don't buy this unless you want to keep buying replacement wings."
3,2 tracks are among the best '60s pop psych,"2 guitar-driven tracks on Flat Earth Society's 1968 album WALEECO -""Four and Twenty Miles"" (Surrealistic Pillow-inspired riffs)""In My Window"" - though generally overlooked by reviewers, are essential."
5,Perfect!,"I've listened to this album more times than I can count. It's unbelievable. For a primarily instrumental (rock/metal) album it never bores you with tired riffs and repetition. It's energetic, complex, engaging, unusual, and just plain fun to listen to. The styles are sweeping and the changes are happily unexpected. Above and beyond everything else, the musicianship is impeccable. Each instrument is played with virtuoso ability but the music never takes itself too seriously, as to be pretentious, which is entirely refreshing. You can tell a lot of care went into making this album and it was worth it. It's a must own for anyone with ears."
1,Leave this one on the shelf,"Mine begins to get tight as you approach the 4"" range and frequently the dial does not return to zero when you bring the caliper jaws back closed. This one I will return back to the home improvement center where purchased."
5,"if you're a fan of brotha lynch, you're gonna love this....","this album is one of the best albums i've heard in a long time... i've been looking for this album in my area for a long time and i finally broke down and ordered it, and it was worth every cent...if you're a fan of brotha lynch you're gonna love this album...lurch bust on every track, and i rarely find a cd i can listen to all the way through and just ride to. its a must have."
4,Good Buy,I had to drain a few gallons of water out of my fuel oil tank this winter after my furnace stopped working. The filter was easy to install. Haven't has any problems since the install.
2,Too bad the analysis doesn't match the preaching,"This book works from an interesting premise-take selected sermons by a noted and popular preacher about main themes in his work, then have someone write analysis. Some of the sermons are brilliant as in Easter is an Earthquake, the opening sermon and one of the best I've ever read. However the sermons are a bit uneven as is the analysis.It's worth the price of the book-especially used- for the opening sermon. Recommend with reservations"
2,Lacking,"I recently purchased a used cargo van. It's over 20 years old, so it was no surprise when the owners manual was nowhere to be found. So I picked up this guide to help me sort through and maintain it.But ""Total Car Care Repair Manual"" it ain't. It seems to stop *just* before giving you useful information. For example:A few of my van's fuses are blown. The Chilton guide helpfully showed me where to find the fusebox. It showed me how to take the plastic cover off. It advises I use a non-metallic tool to ease removal. But it doesn't tell me anything *about* the fuses. No part numbers, no amperages, no indication what fuse does what. Basically, it gave detailed information on everything I could determine by just looking at the van, but absolutely nothing I'd consult a manual for. Which makes it a pretty lackluster manual. :/"
4,Very cute gift idea,"I purchased this item for my 14 year old niece and she loved it. Yes the items and bag are smaller than you would think based on the picture, but if you take the time to read the product details you'd see the total weight of this item is 12 oz. Obviously you're not going to be receiving full size products at 12 oz. total weight."
3,Great things don't always come in small packages,"I was rather surprised with this product when it arrived - the bag is small and the product is in ""smaller than trial"" sized bottles and tubes. While the product is great - the size is what threw me. If you order this - be prepared. The product isn't much bigger than the picture you see in the catalog."
5,A good breakfast,I've been using this product for a while and I'm very happy with it. I put it in my coffee or put it in a smoothie and it makes a good breakfast for me.
5,Live performance with energy,"I'm sorry that I won't get the chance to see Karnataka live, but this CD is the next best thing. Rachel Jones's voice is just as beautiful live as it is on studio tracks, and even though the band sounds very highly produced on their albums, the live songs retain all the energy and full, rich sound I loved from their album. It's likely that only fans will buy this album, but I agree with a previous review that if you want to introduce someone to the band, this excellent compilation of their best songs is a good way to do it."
4,A great classical guitar CD set,"I am a fan of guitar music, and tried out this 2 CD set after hearing it on radio. The music is very good and the guitar is accompanied by a complete orchestra (none other than the immortal Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields).But to be sure, this is classical guitar, and not folk guitar music. I enjoyed this CD very much, but it is not like Spanish guitar or the works of John Williams (the guitar player, not the movie composer).However, if you are a fan of the guitar, as I am, it will be long before you tire of this CD."
2,No need.,"This is a book in which characters look in the mirror to see how good-looking they are (particularly to admire their voluptuous breasts, or the breasts of their friends). It is also a book in which John Updike tries to write feminist characters but succeeds only in building up a group of women who hate each other, who hate their children, who hate other women, and who are idly superior to the men.Ugh."
5,Put a spell on me!,"I've never seen the movie but I have to say I loved the book. Not just a fluffy story about witchy chicks and some guy, but of course social commentary re: feminism and the changing world in the early '70s. Updike is overstylistic sometimes, which works well during the sensual and witchy scenes and less so in other places, but overall, it's a style that can transport the reader. I read this one very, very slowly because I wanted to savor every word.**UPDATE** I watched the movie last night and it was NOTHING like the book! I mean, NOTHING! Three women and a guy and they're in a small town, that's about it. A drag to watch after enjoying the book so much. Not recommended. The book = def'ly recommended."
2,"Verbose, homophobic, and misogynistic.","Updike's novel is totally overworded with unnecessary details that fail to move the story on. Did we really need to know about Sukie contemplating the area between her legs while in the bathroom before having an affair with a married man? And of course the lesbian sex scenes just had to be Updikes hypersexual drive outdoing itself. And I don't think I can count the number of times the word ""fag"", or one of its similars, was used on one hand! Not to mention how our hero Darryl turns out to be one and has conned the women into doing his bidding. The problem is I WANTED to like this book since I love the movie and musical so much. But it was so damn hard to get into I could ONLY read it on the bus because I had to have NO alternative distraction! My opinion: unless you're a huge fan of Updike, get the movie. It's practically a completely different story than the book anyway."
1,"horrible, horrible","This was probably one of the worst books I've ever read; it doesn't even deserve 1 star! Well, I actually couldn't even force myself to finish it. Updike goes on and on and on with pointless descriptions, making it hard to get interested in the book. There really is no plot. He jumps all over the place making things hard to follow. There was also too much crazy sex scenes for me! I would definitely not recommend this one."
2,Disappointed with the book.,"I loved the movie. That's why I bought the book. The movie is fantastic, the book is disappointing. I will not be reading any other books by Updike. He is verbose, slow to read and wanders of tangents."
2,Not What I hoped,"I wanted to like this book. There are passages in it that are written so expressively that you feel like you are there - the music Jane plays before her cello is eaten is an example. But I didn't like the three witch-women - I don't think Updike liked them either. There was so much male fantasy about women that wasn't believeable (I know it's a book about witches) Since it was written about the early 70s, I guess maybe Updike thought he had some enlightened male insight into women and their behavior and thought patterns and desires but I just found it chauvanistic and wishful. And kind of boring at the end."
2,Is It Possible for a Movie to Outshine the Book?,"I would have never thought that it was even a slight possibility, but the book was plodding and just not interesting."
3,Yet another tale from Updike about the sex lives of shallow narcissists,"At first, this book seems like something different from Updike, with its female leads and its fantastic element of witchcraft. But it soon becomes apparent that it is the usual story about the affairs of unpleasant, middle-aged narcissists in small-town New England...but the women in question are even more unsympathetic than most of his characters, going so far as to commit murder for the thinnest reason of petty jealousy, and suffering no real consequences for their actions. Completely unrealistic, in every sense, not just scientifically but artistically. And often just plain nasty. It is fairly well written, and amusing in places, but in the end it is not his best work. Kate Reading's narration of this audio edition is quite entertaining, though."
4,The Widows of Eastwick,"I've been reading Updike for years, and particularly in the New Yorkermagazine.....The ""Witches of Eastwick,"" including the movie version,with Nicholson was good enough, but his followup with ""The Widows,""capped it....his ""stream of conscious,"" style captivated me."
4,A well-written page turner,"To be successful as a writer today (and I use the word succesful in its most vulgur form) it often seems that one must be either horribly mediocre or overly self-indulgent. As such, it is always a pleasure to find a book that is, at its heart, a well-writen page turner. Updike's developed wit and ability to offer concise but insightful descriptions elevate his work above much of the fiction that is popular today. The Witches of Eastiwck is a novel that is both light and heavy; the intriguing characters and slightly quirky plot twists compel one to turn the pages quickly, but the underlying messages about sexuality, love, and the human need for approbation will likely weigh on the reader's mind for quite some time"
2,The movie is TOTALLY different from the book,"If you think you can just watch the movie and know what goes on in this book you are sadly mistaken! This book is definitely different. I am not saying this book was bad, but strange. This is the only instance that I can say that the movie was better than the book in my opinion. I saw the movie way earlier, before I even knew that this was a book first.After reading, I was blown away by how far the movie was removed from the original vision of the author. One minor annoyance to me was that the basic character looks were scrambled around from the book to the screen...not that this really makes a difference in the grand scheme, but reading the book after seeing the movie it was a little difficult to keep the scene in my head straight. I also came away feeling that the author hates women."
4,"Bewitching tangle of taboo topics, charming bourgeois scene.","Updike exudes his knowledge and understanding of womankind in this delightful witchfest, his imagination giving us a clear picture of what our present day sorceresses truly resemble - neighbors, mothers, reporters, cellists. His beautifully varied word usage will keep you on your toes, his darlingly descriptive images will make you laugh and cry simultaneously. In Alexandra, Sukie and Jane's interactions with the devious Darryl Van Horne, you will see your own striving for love and acceptance among the opposite sex and your circle of friends. A must read for all of us with a little witch at heart."
1,Cheaper than L'oreal but caused me to break out!,"I've had good luck with Nivea products in the past so I thought I'd try out this lotion. I'd been using the L'oreal for Men version which worked really well, but was a few dollars more for a smaller bottle.I'm switching back to the L'oreal. The Nivea product made me break out within a few days of using it. I stopped using it for a few weeks, then tried it again. Sure enough, I broke out.Other than that, the product feels a bit greasy in comparison to the L'oreal for Men product. And I guess the scent is a matter of opinion, but they could have done a better job with it.If you have sensitive skin and don't mind spending a few extra bucks, buy the L'oreal for Men product instead."
3,works good,"not super powerful, but quiet and reliable like most IR tools. 1/4 bit thru steel is a little tough on it."
4,basic features at a very good price,"No remote control - but hey, dirt cheap if you get it with free shipping.It's quiet and offers the features I wanted. I used to use a regular fan that took up a chunk of floor space and was awkward to move around.I saw a tower fan that had a remote and a few extra functions ...and knew this is the style I wanted.This fan has a small footprint, can swivel, three speed settings, and also a timer (up to 180 minutes)."
4,good purchase in affordable price,"I was skeptical when i ordered it, but i'm happy with the performance and price i paid. It's perfect for my two medium sized bedrooms. In order to see some performance, you will always have to keep it on on maximum speed.One thing i didn't like is not being able to turn off timer. When you turn on fan, timer has to be set manually, and timer is always ON. Other then that, oscillation, three speed setting is perfect. It takes a little space in corner. With Amazon's free shipping and no taxes at most, the end price i paid makes it worth."
2,Bad quality control,"Was using Copags, decided to try out the supposedly gold standard in cards.Just got the deck, and was disappointed to find that 4 of the cards had significant defects in the paint. The 4 cards had paint flakes on them that can't be washed or scrubbed off, and were rough to touch, screwing up the smoothness/flatness of the cards.Also, a number of other cards had small stain lines in the white background, but this was ok since it didn't screw up the flatness of the cards.Go with Copags. Cheaper and better quality control."
2,NOT WHAT THEY SOLD ME!!!!,"the cards sent to me arent KEM but some bycicle wsop from 2008 plastic cards in a cardboard case. the bad thing about this is that i'm from Mexico and the person that brought them to me is not coming back to USA until 2 months. so i'm stuck with this so-so cards. the friends that asked me to buy them are really disappointed and the worse thing, they don't want to pay me back :( . I wouldn't trust them again!"
5,The best short book if you want to understand something about Africa,"This in my view is by far the best insight into what Africa is produced by a white man. Kapuscinski's perspective is different in that he is not from Britain, or France or other colonial power, or white man of Africa. He brings a different perspective to the usual selection of post-colonial literature. His skill of observation is incredible. After visiting and working in quite a few countries in Africa, I still find his perspective very insightful. His writing grabs you and you can't put down the book. If you want a short wise book, which reads easily and gives you a good idea of what Africa was/is ... this is the book."
3,Not the best,"I think I have read all the books writen by Kapuscinski and this particular one is weak. It seems that the author just took some of the notes that he wrote during his visits to Africa and constructed an unsuccesfully collage; to my big surprise and regret, Kapuscinski just superficially refers to the greatest dissease of many African and Third World countries: corruption. Nevertheless, this book is a just a good initiation for those interested in the forgotten continent politics."
5,Wise Perspective,"I just re-read this after reading it a couple years ago. I caught some things on rereading that I missed the first time around. Kapuszinski well understood African peoples, African politics and African cultures. Among other things, he explains very clearly how and why Idi Amin did what he did in Uganda, how and why Samuel Doe did what he did in Liberia, and how and why the Hutus did what they did in Rwanda. He not only recounts monstrous and terrible acts but understands the actors as persons and understands their motivations. He is a very perceptive writer."
4,Africa,The best book about Africa I have read. The reporting is balanced and full of insight and avoids falling into the the various traps of tourist brochure over-identification preaching etc. If there is a fault it is that is somewhat fragmentary. a set of excellent snapshots or shorts rather than a feature film.
5,Ridiculously Named CDs/Unrivalled Music,"I write this not for the cd itself but the entire alliterative series that seeks to introduce classical music to another generation of listeners. I first started collecting these releases about ten years ago when I needed a broad sampling of chamber music and was delighted to find the quality of the performances superb and the tracks themselves well-chosen and sequenced. Each one of these discs, however cornball the names may be, offers some of the best music written in the last four hundred years. If you love chamber music, this is a wonderful way to acquaint yourself with almost any of the major composers of western civilization."
3,great morning starter,just the kind of music you want to listen to in the morning. a choise of all the masterworks that will open up your eyes slowly and in a nice way.
2,Bit of a drag,"I don't know it was about the stories that didn't work for me, but it was a chore reading it. I think I gave up after a couple of stories, and then for the sake of having bought the book, I kept reading. I don't remember anything about the stories, and what made it so dry. Borrow it from the library. I really don't think it's worth buying."
3,ok for a throw-away thing,"My daughter loved this when she saw it on the web. But it took almost 3 weeks to arrive. Material/quality is ok, looks good, except for the life of me I couldn't figure out how to tie the waist."
4,cute but thin!,Costume is extremely thin AND the tie for the waistline useless. I had to pin it around my daughter's waist. Other than that Great costume! I put black tights and a black turtleneck underneath so that my daughter would stay warm.
2,Image quality is very poor.......,"Where do I start? first off....I have 3 tivo's, two regular and this humax....when i first had the humax hooked up, i noticed the picture looked almost like it was breaking up, it was on a CRT TV and hooked up using an s-video so i blamed the problem on this. in the mean time i bought a 32"" LCD, this time i hooked up the humax using the RGB component cables thinking it would work going all digital....BUT, this did no good either. i used every image quality setting available, all this did was to increase the file size of the recording and reduce the burning size of the DVD. this is not my primary DVD player, so i didn't have the drive failure like the others. also, mine is one of the ""made in mexico"" tivo's, the reason i know this is because i replaced the original HD as soon i got it for a larger drive, btw, it was a ""maxtor"" (good named brand drive). over all, this is a piece of carp, don't buy it.....it's no wonder tivo stopped selling it!"
1,Get the official TiVo!,"The Humax T800 is a poor clone of the official TiVo box, and costs three times as much! It's from a no-name company that may not be around a few months from now. The machine is noisy and makes you worry about whether the hard drive will go south any second. Go with the real TiVo box which is much better and cheaper."
4,Lotta Fun,"Have had this for a few years, never get tired of playing it. It is outdated I know but love those old planes and was a cheap program when I purchased it."
3,So so in the ETO,"Game mechanics are remarkably average. Scenarios are limited and restrictive. If I had to own only one WWII air combat simulation, this wouldn't be it."
3,What I expected,"The game is older but try and find a WW2 flying game now. I dont like flying the jets, prefer the prop warplanes of WW2. easier for an old man to do. Graphics are dated but I was expecting that."
3,I honestly just bought this for the noodles!,"My daughter has a wheat allergy so to satisfy her mac and cheese craving I simply boil some brown rice elbow macaroni and use the cheese package mix out of the Kraft mac and cheese box, discarding the noodles. You can't taste a difference. According to the cheese sauce ingredients supplied by Kraft, the sauce mixture itself does not contain wheat, just the noodles."
3,still makes us miss the gluten,out of the ones we have tried this is the best gluten free mac and cheese but it still isnt great. We still miss traditional mac and cheese taste.
1,Not very good,"I am gluten intolerant and just found out that my daughter has the same concerns. She is in first grade and is switching over to a gluten free diet. When we tried this mac and cheese, not only were we both disappointed, but honestly, it tasted awful! There are not too many GF things that I don't like, but this couldn't even be doctored up. I tried! Not impressed."
4,"Great Product, Lousy Packaging.","The Pasta and Cheddar was wonderful, as always. It allows my wife, who is Gluten sensitive, to have mac and cheese, which she loves. My complaint lies in the packaging. I had indicated that the item was a gift, yet the package arrived with the contents boldly indicated on the box. It also had the invoice openly displayed, which I had requested not be done. In short, LOVE the product, but the packaging policies need to be reviewed."
5,Annie's GF Mac & Cheese,This is one of the first gluten-free foods my daughter found edible when she was diagnosed with Celiac five years ago. It has become one of her comfort foods in spite of the fact that she was never a fan of quick-to-fix mac & cheese before her diagnosis. Gluten-free foods--especially pasta and macaroni can be really fussy--so please take note--just because some reviewers make talk down certain products it's really a matter of personal taste. Don't be afraid to experiment for yourself!!
2,Edible,"I tried this back when I was first diagnosed; there were almost NO products out there that were gluten free, so I was really excited to try this. I'm giving this 2 stars because it actually is edible, but just barely. I couldn't bring myself to ever buy it again, no matter how much I missed mac & cheese."
2,Needs a lot of work to make edible,"I was desperate to find a gluten-free mac n cheese. I was so excited to find this brand and was really impressed by the great reviews. I'm sorry to say that the only part that was worth anything was the noodles. The cheese sauce is terribly thin and tasteless. I had to add salt, pepper, and lots of extra cheese to make it edible. I hope they can make it better in the future."
1,digestive drama!,"One serving = bright orange pooThis happened twice, a few weeks apart and eaten by itself, so I'm 100% sure the effect was correlated to this product. Plus the color was an exact match."
1,if you don't mind food with no taste...,"I am very disappointed in this product. It tastes like nothing at all. If you eat the box instead at least you'll be getting some fiber. If you want good rice mac and cheese, try Amy's in the frozen food section--creamy and delicious!"
2,Awful.,"Terrible, gritty, bland noodles that aren't anything near the consistency of wheat pasta. Under-spiced sauce with very little cheesy ""bite"". Pass on this one, and just use gluten-free cheese sauce packets on on a better pasta, such as Tinkyada's Brown Rice pasta or any other brand that actually tastes and feels like real pasta. This is a waste of money and a real let down from a company whose mac'n'cheese I really loved back when I ate gluten"
4,Best replacement for mac n cheese I have found,"I just add a little shredded cheese to mine to thicken it up a bit. I have tried the frozen gluten free mac n cheese and it had no taste. This is the best I have found so far, apart from making it myself of course :)"
2,Insufficiently Cheesy,"The flavor and texture of the macaroni is decent; not as good as Tinkyada rice pasta products I've had, but palatable. But the ""cheese"" sauce is seriously lacking. I had to add a considerable amount of shredded cheddar cheese to make this actually taste cheesy. Given the high price per (puny) serving, I shouldn't have to be doctoring it up to get to taste like macaroni and CHEESE."
5,Surprisingly good!,"I am new to the gluten free life. And I was really, really worried about giving up mac and cheese. I ordered this, thinking it would probably taste like cardboard or something. Boy, was I surprised! It was excellent. The noodles have good texture. It was just as easy to make as the blue box stuff. And most importantly, it tasted GREAT! Give it a try."
4,"GF, instructions are ridiculous","It tastes pretty good, but it says to use a lot of water on the package ... 3 quarts seems very excessive for mac and cheese. Works well with half of that."
2,NOODLES COME OUT HARD,"Good taste, but I had to cook the noodles 5 min longer to get them even close to an edible softness."
2,No Match for Homemade or Kraft,Very easy to overcook the pasta and the cheese sauce mix is yucky.This product is no match for the macaroni and cheese I grew up with or the product from Kraft.
4,"Convenient, tasty, good pricing","I always add just a little bit of cheddar to this before I add the cooked macaroni because, imho, it's not quite cheesy enough. Otherwise, the amazon price is right for subscribing to it. Absolutely worth it for diagnosed celiac or glutenfree kids & families."
4,Delicious!,"I love mac-n-cheese and have been gluten free for about 2 years now. Annie's is my favorite GF substitute! My husband, who isn't gluten free likes it also. I just wish there was a little bit more in the box."
5,Gluten Free bargain,I loved the cost per box after purchasing the case of this product. I enjoy this Gluten Free Version of a quick Mac/Cheese.
5,Loved it!!,I LOVE this macaroni and cheese. Haven't had mac and cheese in over a year since I went gluten free. I was surprised how big the noodles are. I am doing Weight Watchers and 1 cup of this is just 7 points on the points plus program! My 9 year-old just went gluten free a month ago with me and she was so excited about this product because she is feeling deprived of some foods she loved. Will be staying on the subscribe and save with this one. Thanks Annie's Homegrown!
4,Good Option for Gluten Free Mac & Cheese,I bought this at the store before committing to a 12 pack. For a gluten free product it tastes very good. It does not taste just like Kraft Mac & Cheese but it's gluten free so what do you expect? It is very good for a gluten free mac & cheese and I am sure that gluten free kids who have never had Kraft etc. would like it a lot.
2,Gluten-free mac n cheese,My son did not like this very much. It was hard being diagnosed just before 12 years old when he hit puberty it set in. We really enjoy the corn pasta. It holds up better and better flavor!
4,"Yummy, easy GF side dish","Before going GF, we loved Annie's mac and cheese... we really missed it! When we found this we were thrilled. It is very good. The pasta has a fabulous consistency - Annie's should sell it by itself!The problem is that one box does not make very much :( I need to make two boxes to make to make enough for my family. It is pricey as well and spending almost $3 on a little bit of comfort food is only worth it now and then.It's great for a treat but not a staple in my pantry."
5,Delicious,This pasta is wonderful. Finding 'wheat free' alternatives is difficult and finding delicious alternatives is even harder but Annie's has brought pasta back into our diet ~ thank you Annie's.
5,Awesome!!!,"If you've been around the block searching for gluten-free or wheat-free groceries, you're in for a real treat. This is the best best boxed mac-n-cheese I've had and I've had quite a few. This is great item made as suggested. Honestly, it's better than your typical wheat pasta kraft mac-n-cheese, but if you're searching for a fine culinary dining no type of mac-n-cheese is for you."
5,Best GF mac n cheese,"Love this mac n cheese. So creamy and cheesy. Kids will love it. Closest to Kraft you can get, But healthier. I add a little milk and butter and then whisk the cheese a little before adding the pasta. Gluten free heaven."
5,so happy i found this!,"This Mac and cheese is great, especially if you cannot have the regular kind. This is the first rice pasta we have tried and it was every bit as good as Annie's regular Mac and cheese. I actually thought it was better because the noodles in this one are bigger. I added a little shredded cheddar but I have always done that to any Mac and cheese. My 13 month old loved this and my 4 1/2 year old, who adores Mac and cheese, ate 2 servings. Thanks Annie's for allowing my family to have Mac and cheese again!"
5,Delicious!,"I got this because I have celiacs and as a result am incredibly sensitive to gluten. This is very safe and I had no negative side effects at all. It's also very easy to make and it's delicious. I loved this! I will definitely be buying this again and recommend it for anything who's forced to be on a gluten-free diet but loves the taste of mac and cheese. It's delicious. I've eaten it several times in one day. I had this with soy milk rather than normal milk so maybe that makes it taste different, but I was very happily surprised at how good it is."
2,Works to a certain degree,"This product does a nice job exfoliating your dead skin cells but there were some issues that unfortunately will make me continue my search for cleansing pads. First, the smell of the product is so strong it permeates before you even open the container. Rough textured pads leave a oily/greasy film on your face. Not sure if I received a product that was doused for extra long in the facial cleansing oils but it was too overwhelming to use. Threw out the product after a few uses."
1,"Weird smell, ineffective.","This has a bizarre smell to it, doesn't make my face feel clean, and has done nothing for my acne. I bought this because I really enjoy theFacial Blemish Stick-Anti-Bacterial with Tea Tree - .31 oz - Stick, but this has very little in common and does nothing right.I really hated using these."
1,too drying,"i should send these back, but its such a small item and price to spend time returning, so i am going to try and find another use. Its actually my fault, i have sensitive skin and am proned to irritating and drying. I should have looked at the ingredients because these things are LOADED with alcohol."
2,Buyer Beware,I have ordered from this same company before and when I reordered I just went to my past purchase and hit order again. Since then the Company has changed the ingredients. Side by side comparison shows that it is no longer mainly Tea Tree Oil but rather alcohol and you can smell and tell the difference. I contacted customer service and they give me the run around. If you are looking for the real deal in Tea tree oil than don't bother with this. Do the research and find others. This is the first negative feedback I have had to give with Amazon after dealing with them for many years now))-;
1,toast burner,very uneven heating. making toast in this is an exercise in frustration. NOT recommended
4,"Great Toaster, Recommended","1) I love the design of the toaster. It's vertical with two trays on top of each other. This helps save counter space for those with limited room. And personally I like the unique design. 2) It heats up fast and you have the option of heating up just the top rack, just the bottom, or both at the same time. 3) It's reliable and seems well built. 4) Price-wise it's a great value.Update Feb 13, 2003: I've had the toaster for around 3 months and the oven is in good working order. My only complaint is with the ""cookie sheet"" pans that go in the oven---they flake easily. Like the surface of a non-stick cooking pan that's gotten old, these pans started flaking shortly after. One of them I left in the sink and my guess is that the continued exposure to water caused it. Whatever the reason, they're pretty cheap pans. Overall, I'm still happy with the way the oven performs."
5,Great Toaster,"This toaster is the greatest. My family uses a toaster oven to reheat food, cook snacks, and make toast. This toaster oven is great because it doesn't take up much space, has two racks, and provides a choice in heating options (saving me on electricity). I've had several toaster ovens in the past and this is by far my favorite. The only downside is for people who like to cook bigger items in their toaster oven because it doesn't provide a lot of height between the tray and the heating element. Perfect for my family."
2,New Sanyo Toasty Bought Because The Old One Was Great,It saddens me to have to say that this is probably the worst piece of kitchen ware that I have bought.The old one toasted evenly. This one often gives you a single dark streak and very uneven toasting.If I bought this in a retail store I would have returned it.Because I bought it over the internet I do not want to bothershipping it back.
4,Small footprint & Good performance,"While we've only had this a few weeks, we like the product & it works as advertised. It is unique for its small footprint where counter space is at a premium. It is not the quickest at doing toast but it comes out to our satisfaction."
5,Great Product,"This Sanyo (space saver) Toaster oven was purchased to replace the Sanyo model that I have used for 30 YEARS (The old one still worked fine, in fact I passed it on to a friend), but the ""Bagle-Best"" was a little larger and had more features... Great Product / Highly recommended."
4,Sanyo Toastie Oven,Love the vertical shape as I have little counter space. I looked at sooo many small toaster ovens which were poorly made. The manufacturing quality of this little oven is far above the others. I have been away a lot and haven't had time to use it for for baking or reheating. ( that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ) It makes great toast though.
4,new changes,"I LOVE THE OVEN. i HAVE 2 OLDER MODELS, WHICH I LIKE BETTER,THAT HAVE PORCELAIN AND ALLUMINUM TRAYS. I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD, BUT THEY STLL WORK PERFECTLY"
5,Far better than any mere toaster,"Unlike regular toasters, the Toasty can handle real-sized bagels. I also use it to warm up small amounts of chicken nuggets, fish fillets and fries when my picky-eating kids don't want the regular meal. The small footprint makes this a must. This doesn't require the counterspace for a regular toaster oven."
2,Cute but defective,"Liked the design. Cooks slowly. Timer was defective. No service centers in Pittsburgh area! Had to mail back to California, because I bought it as a gift and didn't open it and test it before the 30-day return period was up. Not sure I'd recommend this or any Sanyo small appliance."
2,too small with little temperature control,for making toast it's ok or melting cheese on toast but does not work well for reheating. the space is too small and the heat too high. this makes it burn on the edges while still cold in the middle.
1,Not what I was looking for...,"I couldn't tell from the dials in the photo that this doesn't have temp settings, just lo->hi and timed up to 15 minutes. I was looking for an oven that I could set to a specific temperature and it would run until I told it to stop. Also, the bottom level tended to burn anything I tried to make. I quickly handed this off to a friend who was in need of any type of toaster and went back to my $20 model that did what I needed it to."
4,Good at what it does,"You won't be turning out layer cakes or creme puffs from this little appliance, but it's very good for toasting the business sides of a cut bagel or a couple of pieces of garlic bread. Team up with a microwave for interior cooking and use this toaster for browning, and you can save time on a lot of different dishes. Unfortunately, the space constraints of this model limit you to rather small scale executions.Cleanup is no better and no worse than any other toaster oven, with the exception of the sealed quartz elements which are much easier to wipe clean than the usual exposed tungsten elements.Considering its low price and its small footprint on the counter, this toaster oven makes a versatile and economical contribution to a small apartment kitchen or a second kitchen used for entertaining."
5,Long wait but worth it.,Amazon kept me waiting on this one... well over a month. I'm glad I didn't cancel it because this toaster turned out to be so cool. Still surprised at how little counter space it takes up. Regarding posts about less then perfect toast: perhaps it has been improved because mine makes perfect toast. It will cook frozen foods like french fries & chicken fingers before my oven would have even finished preheating. Only thing I worry about is where to find such small pans if I need to replace them.
1,"This is a toaster, not a toaster oven","Save your money on this one. All it does is toast. It does not have any other temperature, not really very good at reheating. buy a regular toaster instead of this one."
3,"Ok, but just adequate.","Item does have a small footprint, which is nice, but as a toaster oven, I still miss my old B&D that I had for over twenty years. This item feels flimsy, and I doubt it will have the lifetime of the B&D. The settings can't be trusted to produce the same results from use to use - it toasts more quickly at the same setting after it warms up, so I find I have to keep an eye on it whenever I use it, since I still am unsure what the results will be even after several months of usage. Only the bottom rack is removable for cleaning, and generally the unit is awkward to clean. It is also only usable for toasting, and is not an oven at all. This was the best I could find after 4 months of checking reviews and talking to friends (who only said the new B&Ds are trash and were unable to recommend any toaster oven)."
4,Toasty,"I like this toaster because it is a space-saver, and it is versatile. Four stars rather than five? A thin slice of bread does not toast well on both sides. I use it for grilled cheese or muffins and bagels/baily."
3,Mediocre but appealing,"Plot Synopsis: Claire is a professional photographer who is hired to photograph hockey star Jason. There's instant heat between them, but then Claire's best friend gets Jason to agree to accompany her as his ""date"" to an ex-boyfriend's wedding. Much confusion ensues.The Claire and Jason characters are immensely appealing, and we're eventually given decent explanations for their actions. But those reasons, especially for Jason, aren't given in time. The plot seems muddled, sometimes lurching along very slowly, and sometimes moving almost too briskly. The conflict between the hero and heroine comes about far too quickly, with very little development, and is cleared up almost as quickly.Kelleher has given us some good characters, and the ""heat"" between Claire and Jason is written well, but the plot is far too uneven for me to recommend this book."
3,Product Came Really Dirty!!,Product was the correct one - the only issue I had is the white skin was really dirty with 1 stain. We were able to clean it up and my son was happy with it though.
2,More sales management than sales,This is a book about sales management and not as much about selling. It is also a commercial for these Trimetrics assessments that Mr. Brooks must market and sell. I can't imagine that past the first chapter or 2 a salesman would get much out of it. It is certainly a decent book for sales managers but not so much for sales people.
2,Misleading Title,"If you buy this book because you search for scientific thought in the field of sales methodologies or persuasion, you will be diasappointed. It contains nothing of that. Salespeople will find nothing of value. The books is about tips for sales managers, thus the two stars."
5,Witchi Tai To,"As an anser to R. Rimple, a music CD for a film mostly contains the music written by the film's overall composer. The ""external"" songs used are usually listed at the end of the film, as is done here. The song you ask for, is called ""Witchi tai to"" performed by Everything is Everything, found on Amazon on this record:(...)I have heard this song several times in films, and thought it was made by one of the former Beatles."
3,Sleeps score by Willaims - great string writing,"The score for ""Sleepers"" is somewhat uneven, but of course story, editing and a director's directions so often govern the consistency or lack thereof of style, texture, etc. Above all, several cues for ""Sleepers"" - especially the final cues clearly demonstrate John Williams' masterful string scoring and create a certain sense of pain, fate, bittersweet nostalgia and overriding pathos that the actors and director strive to create. Williams is always in a class by himself even when he's so strictly bound by the technique and style of his collaborators."
1,to 'moaneto',"Hi,The song from the bar scene when kevin bacon was killed was driving me mad too!! it's Witchi Tai To - Everything Is Everything if you copy and paste the link below you can have a listen. Hope this helpshttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Q6Q4/102-9863115-3549742?v=glance&vi;=samples&n;=5174"
2,Where is the rest of the music?,"I was hoping to hear the songs played in backround reflecting the era and times they grew up. There is one song in particular that I heard and I do not know the name of. It sound like, ""Witcha tie tie ....Owanika Owanika hey hey hey hey oh ah"". If anyone knows this please respond."
2,well...,"a hard-to-follow plot, but has some good performances by unknown talent, especially the two young black leads."
4,"Londrina: Coffee, money and prostitutes","A small but very good portrait of prostitutes lives and geographic space in Londrina, Paraná, Brazil.People who enriched wanted amusement and a plane every month landed Londrina with new beautiful prostitutes - ""balaio de putas"". But these lifes weren't always joy and smiles (to the men, of course)."
4,Lucid and Practical - W2K GP Mystique Removed,"If you require lucid and practical explanations of W2K GP, Profiles, and IntelliMirror, this is the text.Each of the nine chapters and Appendicies contain useful and practical information. Information as it relates to .Net enhancements and differences is appropriately included and thoughtfully discussed.In chapter 1, you can immediately implement simplistic yet instructive GP's.In chapter 9 and Appendix B, you are provided with real world information on deploying W2K - W2K is not deployed in a void. The successful deployment of W2K requires the integration with in place NT and Windows/9X environments. These two sections of the text are replete with valuable information.The remaining chapters provide similar quality information.This is a must have text for anyone serious about successfully planning, deploying, and suporting native and mixed W2K environments using GP, Profiles, and IntelliMirror."
4,Good product,"I purchased these tubes for my bike because I ride in the woods a lot and I need a thorn resistant tube (standard tubes are lucky to last more than a few days where I ride). These tubes feel nice and thick when you handle them. I did have one go flat (there is no such thing as puncture-proof, only varying degrees of puncture-resistant) but since then I've had zero problems and the tubes are holding up fine after months of riding. FWIW, it's somewhat hard to find presta valve, thorn resistant tubes in this size, so if you need heavy-duty tubes, these work well in my experience."
3,A Decent book,"This is a decent book, the author did a good job at describing both sides of the Windsor feud. However, Mr. Thorton's writing style is a little too dry for my taste, and he really doesn't bring the figures to life for the reader's imagination."
4,Chilton Manual for Fiero,"Better than the Haynes manual in most chapters for detail. Almost as good as the GM service manual, but lots cheaper."
2,"not bad, but not very well built.",I like this pointer very much but sometimes you have to shake it to make the connection.
3,Expensive stocking stuffer,"This laser pointer provided daily entertainment for my 13 year old for about a week. Then the batteries went dead. It took him a couple more days to buy the little cell batteries it takes and put them in. Meanwhile, his interest in it waned and now it's only used every couple of days for a few minutes."
1,Rplacement,"I want this to be five star ***** but I cant change it.After recieving inccorect item, I contacted the Company through Amazon and the company fixed the problem in one day."
1,This toy is like a bomb...,"I ordered this toy because i wanted a good laser pointer for a good price. Unfortunatly, i got this thing. This toy is like a bomb, when you push the on button it doesn't work no more. Mine didn't even turn on! psh, it's not like i'm going to pay a whole 5 bucks to return that stupid thing. I didnt even get to shine it in someone's eyes (which is very unsafe). I do not suggest buying this toy. ever. especially if you want to shine it in peoples eyes (which is a serious health risk that Amazon.com does not endorse)."
4,Great Fun With Your Pet!,"I bought this on the advice of a neighbor, and it's a super pet toy! No, the pet doesn't chew on it. You catch their attention by flashing the beam across the room and Oh, what's that? I'm going to get it! There! Wait, where did it go? What, is that it over there? Well I can get that! And that! And that! ... You can use it indoors in a not too bright room, or with the lights or, or outdoors at night; it's all equally fun. And I have used it to the delight of a miniature poodle, a dachshund, and an English setter. Cats love it even more. I know of one cat who loves playing with the beam so much that she comes loving every time she hears the click of the beam (her owner has a different style).This pointer can point really far, which is a plus. A couple of the tips aren't useful (i.e., the $ sign), but choose any of the large symbols and you are set to go for a fun, interactive time with your pet!"
1,"Fun for cats, but...","I received this as a gift to entertain my cats, but like others listed here I found it poorly designed. It works sporadically, if at all."
5,Handy stuff for kitchen,I love this stool. It's so handy and I can put it in tiny space between fridge and oven. Small and handy!
4,"Compact, Sturdy and Easy to use","Best deal for the money. Folds up easy. We use it in the kitchen to reach high places, it folds up and slides easily in next to the refrigerator. Stool is sturdy, and does not slip on the floor when opened up.Great Product."
4,"nice but, didn't keep it","seemed like it would work for what i needed but, i found a much smaller/slimmer version at TJMAXX for $7.99 so keeping this was not an option."
2,Can't replace rubber handle,"We have two of these at our house and use them often.We have also experienced a few ""finger pinches"", but my biggest complaint is I cannot find a replacement for a broken rubber handle.I will not pay $25 for a new stool just to get a new rubber handle!Except for these obvious defects, I would give it a higher rating.Polder 2 Step Stool without Rail"
3,Finger pinching experience,"I bought this step stool primarily because it folds up to fit a slim storage space in the kitchen. It is of good construction and sturdy to stand on. However, two of us middle-aged types find the opening mechanism difficult to use and both had fingers pinched a couple of times trying to open/close it. It has now been consigned to the garage where it can be left open."
2,Safey issues for little fingers!,"The stool is great as far as it's ability to function. It is quite thin which makes it easy to store. It does have a safety issue!!!!! My 3 year old son got his finger pinched when we were adjusting it to push it together. I almost got my finger pinched as well on more than one occassion. My husband welded it together and now it remains in the open position thus, no more pinched fingers. I would think twice before purchasing this one if you have toddlers around. I was right there when my son pinched his finger and it was difficult to open the stool back up to release his finger."
3,"Easy to open, hard to close","Easy to open, compact, and strong. Difficult to close, and really difficult to close without pinching yourself. Price seems fair."
3,"Nothing flashy, but it works...","My wife and I own other CDs from this series, and this isn't one of my favorites. I am unfamiliar with most of the music on ""Beethoven for Book Lovers,"" and none of it seems to be very notable. However, it accomplishes its presumed goal as great background music for reading, with very soothing recordings of these lesser-known works of Beethoven. I can't rave about this one, but it's certainly workable and worthwhile to own if you actually do desire ""an intimate companion for reading."""
5,Best movie ever!!!,I love this movie been a fan of this movie for years .... It came out when I was one years old started watching this movie at the age of 7 I love it growing up and I still do ... Makes me cry every time I see it its also hilarious I rate this movie 5 stars it never gets old ....
5,First Time Novelist Gets Published,"Way to go, Laurel Mills! ""Undercurrents"" put me in touch with my compassion for the disabled, understanding of grief after losing a loved one, a parent's unconditional support of their children, the beauty of our New England states and so much more. Keep it up, Laurel Mills. Along with your new readers, I look forward to your next novel in the fall - ""Racing Toward Providence."""
5,Great trains of Canada,This is one of the best videos I've ever seen about Canadian trains! There's 7 more just like it. Beautiful scenery behind the scenes history. Recommended!
3,Easy Listening Mariachi,"This is odd stuff to me. It might be common in elevators in Mexico City, for all I know, but this is my first experience with Mariachi Muzak-style.These are classic Mariachi songs arranged for muted Mariachi horns, string orchestra, and guitars - no vocals except for some la-la-las on one track. The horns are actually very good, but it's all very mellowed and sweetened. Might make good background music for a quiet Mexican dinner, if you like Easy Listening. (48:42 total time)"
5,An Amazing Achievement,"In July 1988, Cecil Taylor recorded ten (!) albums while performing live at a festival celebrating his music in Berlin. The discs include the classics ""Pleistozaen Mit Wasser"" with Derek Bailey, ""Spots, Circles And Fantasy"" with Han Bennink, ""Remembrance"" with Louis Moholo, ""Leaf Palm Hand"" with Tony Oxley, and this title, ""Riobec"" with drummer Gunter Sommer. These discs are only available as imports on the FMP label. They may be a bit expensive, but for fans of avant-garde jazz and European improvised music, they are must purchases. All of the discs feature extended compositions, and some are over an hour in length, so you do get a lot of music for the $21 price tag. While I do not find ""Riobec"" as enjoyable as ""Leaf Palm Hand"" or ""Spots, Circles And Fantasy,"" Taylor is truly at home in the drummer duo setting, and his collaboration with Sommer is excellent. These recordings represent an amazing achievement in the history of jazz."
3,Same Soup different Crackers,"Most popular Black fiction revolves around relationships and the their inherent drama. I complained about having to read this book the moment it was chosen but I confess it was better than I anticipated.The book unfolds in an alternate narrative between the Husband and the wife, who open the book physically separated and growing further apart by the word. I will spare you the gory details of their relationship and its dilemmas, but I will say that I found the characters rather predictable and shallow. It is obvious that the authors are quite in tune with the emotional turmoil of a dissolving marriage. It would be remarkable if one author could expose the inner workings of both the male and female mind, but considering this is a book written by a married couple, it is merely acceptable. I believe it will be entertaining and even a bit informative to those struggling in dysfunctional marriages, considering they are honest enough to accept both sides of a complex story."
3,Very Entertaining,"Although this book had a familiar theme (infidelity/marriage issues)I found it refreshingly witty. I especially liked the creative freedom the authors had to write as if they were speaking directly to the reader in some parts. I read it in a very short amount of time. It was light reading with ""laugh out loud"" storytelling."
4,A Great Spark for Meaningful Discussion,"The book started off slow for me but I found myself unable to put it down when the plot thickened. I chose if for my book club to discuss and it allowed us to have a frank and candid discussion about the complexities of relationships. I applaud the authors for exploring infidelity, love, family and friendships in a compelling way!Lorraine Morris ColeCo-author of Work It, Girl! The Black Woman's Guide to Professional Success"
4,"LOVE HERE , GOOD and RIGHT NOW!!!","This book reads like reality without the t.v. Just about every couple can relate to this book and they get to hear the story from both the Randy and Mekhi's point of view. I found that to be very refreshing and absolutely eye-opening to say the least. Though parts of it may seem to drag early on, there's a bulid-up you won't expect that brings it all home. It's a good read that I recommend to all couples and definately to the ladies no matter where you are in your relationship. This book gives it to you straight-up. The pill maybe a bit hard to swallow, regardless of your gender though."
2,Too Much Work for a Predictible Ending,There was way too much detail and not enough attention to the story. Why did I have to read about every past life event while the author was describing a current situation? I do not like that type of writing style.
3,It was ok,"This was a book about marriage, and the problems that can come up. I didn't really care for Mikki, the wife's characther at all, I don't think being able to compromise was in her at all, not saying that Randy was the perfect husband, but at least he tried. I don't think Mikki got what got what she deserved, but it was an ok read."
4,An Exciting Upgrade,"I was looking for a long time for an upgrade from my smaller lens(18-55mm). This lens works very quick and I can get farther distances than I could with my other lens. It isn't that much bigger and is just as easy to carry. The cleaning pen and filter it comes with is just superb.I mostly use the UV lens all the time to protect my new lens, it works very well. They don't even feel cheap (I have bought cheap filters in the past). All of the products that comes with the price of paying for the one single lens is a great deal.I'll put some pictures up and leave a link to my photography site for examples of how this lens works.Its a great price, it isn't broken or used, and i love the fact that it is actually from Nikon itself. It also comes with a warranty.I may not have anything of great value to say, All I can say is I very much enjoyed my purchase."
2,Disappointed,The breadbox is flimsy. Not at all sturdy. You have to be careful opening and shutting the cover. Also much shinier than I thought stainless steel would be. The measurements in the ad were different than on the box.
3,It'll Do:),"It is very simple. Nothing to rave about. I love this black trimming, it adds some sort of details to all the stainless steel. Really good box if you need something that looks good in the kitchen , wipes clean and closes well."
2,Arrived Dented,Opened the box on xmas and the side was all dented. It was embarassing. The thickness of the stainless steel is more like that of a soda can. Auto-door opens nicely. Size is a little small but works for 1 loaf and a smidge more.
1,Heed the warnings,"Bought this as a gift for my mom - was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box and it was severely dented (which caused the paint on the underside to chip). She decided to keep it as we were able to pop-out some of the dents and she was didn't think anyone would notice the chipped paint on the underside. It was strange because the box was not at all damaged, but the item was a mess. I had read similar reviews and ignored them. Very Disappointed."
4,Great look.,"It looks great in my kitchen and is a lot bigger than I expected. The only issue is that the front cover is hard to slide down. It doesn't close smoothly like it should. It still closes, but with a little work."
5,Stainless Steel Bread Box,Met all my expectations. Would highly recommend it to anyone (especially where there is limited counter space). Would also make a great gift.
1,dont buy this item,Not much to say about this item it sucks. very thin and cheap made. Does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah This is the worst product i have every got from Amazon.
1,"Deluxe? Try ""Cheap""","I decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it. The metal is thin and flimsy, and the construction very poor (e.g., little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose). Also, it was a bit lopsided, so it did not sit squarely on my counter.Maybe it works fine. Who knows. The design and manufacture were so poor, I didn't keep it long enough to find out."
2,VERY POOR QUALITY!!!!!,"I had read the reviews that were left for this item before I purchased it. I realize that everyone has their own opinions on everything. So, I decided to take my chances and purchase the item even though there were multiple comments about it being a poor quality item. It was packaged very well, however, the breadbox had two dents in the roll top portion and the paint has blob-like spots on the front of the item. It is off square and the lid opens (rolls back)at an angle. I wish I would have taken the words of others to account and saved myself some money."
3,bread box,It arrived with a dent in the bottom. Don't know if delivery service or warehouse dropped it. When reported another was on it's way immediately. It arrived safe and sound without any complications.
4,"A good, cheap read.","Before I describe this book, the following needs to be said: This is not a military or Soviet history of the cold war.That being said, this book is a fine economic and diplomatic history of the Cold War, from an Anglo-American perspective. Whild that may sound like a narrowly-focused book, it really is not, as the author uses well-placed juxtpositions and anecdotes that track the shifting attitudes of NATO Countries and the Soviet Union throughout the war. Particularly interesting is the analysis of each side's economy and the US-USSR tendency to try to bluff each other out.Reading this book requires sketchy knowledge of the military history of the war.While there are certainly newer and better general-histories, the unique angle of this book, combined with its bargain price due to age, makes it a great and enlightening read."
4,The Cold War is a hot read,"A very good outline of 1945-1991 and a couple of years afterwards. I learned a lot of new things about the conflict (that the Soviets didn't really want to invade Afghanistan, JFK was elected on an anti-Communist hawk platform, Britain since WWII), although I do agree with other reviewers that he left out many things. Walker spends about 70% of his time on the west and 30% on the Soviets in each decade, so the Evil Empire's motives and actions are a bit murky. Britain from the mid-sixties to the Thatcher era is dropped. And he does spend a lot of time on the economic markets of post-war Europe & Japan, that while interesting to me at first, I bought the book for history not economics. But those are just quibbles. Overall, the book is a good start for anyone wanting to know about the Cold War."
3,this is one crazee recording,"this recording isn't something you'd play every day, cuz it's just drums and percussion instruments ... but it's good for variety. i've never heard anything quite like it before. it'll really stretch your mind."
4,this stuff works,it helped me regain some control over my morbid fatigue and other thyroid symptoms that are associated with fibromyalgia-related low thyroid. If you know your thyroid has been sluggish but do not register as clinically hypothyroid this product may provide you the relief that you desperately seek (but that by-the-book endocrinologists refuse to provide).just be prepared for a mild downer when you stop taking the stuff.(at least that's what happened to me)good luck and feel better!
1,Another Scam Product,Do not buy this item. Its a plain ripoff just like so many other products promising things. I purchased this product because Ive had a problem with fatigue for years. Ive been down every avenue for treatment of the problem. I think I have hypothyroidism but I dont think my blood levels are low enough to be diagnosed. So I figured Id give this stuff a try in the hopes that maybe itd boost my levels a bit. Nope. Just another product with capsules that look like theyre filled with wheat flour.
2,"I think this is good product, but","this last bottle came witha ton of broken caplets which means that I got jiped and everytime I get any out, i get covered in the dust(ingrdiants). I would like to be compensated."
5,"If you like The Stones, Zepplin or Pearl Jam buy this album","This album has it all. It is a very diverse album with hard, funky, pop and classic styles of rock. The album goes up and down a musical roller coaster with out ever being derailed. This album is great!"
3,Mostly what I wanted...,"I wanted to order a small sized poster of the chakras. I was relatively happy with the size, however, the words were tougher to read than I'd counted on. Partially it was the font, but mostly it was the size. On the bright side, the colors are nice!"
2,A true disappointment,Amazingly this compilation has managed to get together some of the most untallented performances of Brahms' music. With a few exceptions the moto of this CD can be summed up as 'no understanding and appreciation for a musical genius'. The choice of music is also quite perfunctory. There are many Brahms pieces that could have served better the bedtime purpose. Buy at your own risk. My only fear is that some people will get their first impressions of Brahms from this CD...
4,pre bedtime music,Great music for helping you unwind after a long day so you can be more relaxed at bedtime.
5,Beautiful recording,Beautiful! My son likes to listen to it while falling alseep in bed at bet time and that is good!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,The first movie was great but by the time they got to the third one it was like they just gave up.
1,2 and 3 are a complete waste,Buy Starship Troopers #1 in Blu-Ray - its kind of fun. Do not waste your time or money on #2 and #3.
4,Good quality,"I still wish HD won the war, but the Blue Ray is nice. Mabye it's because I have three HD players! Funny movies lots of over acting and sub par animation, but funny enough thats what I love about these movies. Good sexy fun."
2,"First One Good, 2nd one Waaay Bad, 3rd just OK...","First one is and always will be a really good SF movie. The second movie however was just plain dumb. It was really bad. The thrid movie was more like the original but the plot line was weak and the acting was just okay. If you are a real SF buff, buy the third one but forget abount the second one."
3,fair,"decent movies, the 2nd and 3rd ok, but could have been better. I enjoyed the first one for its scifi kick. the 2nd one and 3rd are good but definately ended short. Either way I recommend if you liked the first to get the set."
1,Ripoff,Troopers 1 is good but 2 and 3 are incredibly cheap productions using old scenes from the first episode. The editing and story are second rate. Don't waste your money.
4,Bug and Guts,"What can I say, I loved the first movie and the second and third followed up reasonably well.The second and third didn't have the same sense of fun the first one did, no shooting off someone's arm and have them shout ""MEDIC!!!!"" Casper van Dien is such a lousy actor he ends up being good in an odd way."
3,Eh,"I bought this for the third one and to get the first one DVD rather than VHS, for those purposes it was great. 2 was like a horror movie rather than a sci-fi, but it was kind of fun in a campy way."
5,Starship Troopers unite!,"First I would like to say that there is a place in the SCIFI Genre for this type Movie. I enjoyed #1 and #3. Number 2 was a joke, what??!?!!? we have cloning tech now so the Captain of the Roger Young survived getting cut in two be a blast door and is now a Sgt in the second film? They could not find someone else to play the part? That being said, The third movie was a really well done movie, but there was a little bit too much about religion in it for my liking....I know thats the type movie it is, but as a former Soldier, I dont care who you is, and what you say when your smoking and jokin with your bro's, when the bugs start coming, you start praying... The premise of the movie was good and it is a worth while movie to watch...They need a 4th movie, the need to finish it. Now that they have a planet buster, I would say it would be off to Klendathu and deal with big K once and for all. $45-50 for 3 movies, good to go and have a great time..."
2,only the first movie is worth watching,Save your money. Only the first movie is worth watching. The sequels are lame rip-offs of the title.
3,Pretty Picture book,This book would make a lovely coffeetable book. If you are looking for a book about quilting then this is not for you. I found this book to mostly showcase what the author's accomplishments rather than teach others. I love Jensen's quilts but feel like I've been cheated with this book.
3,enjoyed the book,I enjoyed this book. Many of the pages were blank but the book itself was enjoyable. Beautiful illustrations and many good ideas for future projects.
1,Poor Judgement,"This book would make a lovely coffeetable book. If you are looking for a book about quilting then this is not for you. I found this book to mostly showcase what the author's accomplishments rather than teach others. I was so VERY disappointed that there were not very many quilts in this book. It was a fluffy book about her home, etc. I love Jensen's quilts but feel like I've been cheated with this book."
5,Great survey of takeout doubles and associated methods,"Again Mike Lawrence writes the bible on a bridge topic. It is hard to imagine a more thorough treatment of the topic of takeout doubles. Mike writes on regular takeout doubles, delayed takeout doubles, balancing doubles, responding to doubles, etc. He touches on a number of expert treatments along the way.A great book for all players. As with most of Mike's books, novices will find the material demanding."
3,"Decent take out food, not fine dinning","The book covers a decent amount of ground, but doesn't go into very much detail in any particular area. The book is geared towards intermediate/advancing players who are looking for a refresher on take out doubles, with a few more advanced topics thrown in for good measure. Mike Lawrence has written several 5-star books that are in-depth and chock full of real-life examples and practical guidance. This, unfortunately, is not one of them."
3,not great,"I got this toy as a gift, my daughter enjoys the bucket, but she could have used a plastic cup and been just as happy, the fish gets yucky inside from staying wet, and she showed no interest in the other objects. They have tiny numbers on then, hard to see not very educational."
1,Spare yourself,"I gave this book one star based on the fact the heroine is not the usual 22 year old. However, the plot is absolutely ridiculous, the heroine a weakling, and there is just no sense to any of it."
1,Very poorly written,"I have read several other JB novels but this was by far the worst. The older woman, younger man story line did not bother me so much as the pathetic dialogue and ridiculous story lines and subplots. One of the worst romance novels I have ever read!"
3,WESELL'S VESSEL,"To begin, you really CAN'T ACTUALLY FIT the Zam Wesell figure in the craft without some serious contortioning of plastic-and once in, just dash any hope of positioning the figure in any VAGUELY realistic pose! Poor figure access aside, the craft sports an inaccurate and bright green and yellow paint job. The craft also features collapsable front mandibles to simulate a collision. These are encased in some type of rubber/plastic-like material which is very poor at maintaining the sleek ships' lines. Dual rear tail spikes are also made from the same stuff and regardless of how hard you try, still can't be made to stay straight. you would think we were still vack in the Kenner toy days"
5,This stuff is amazing!,"I have had problem nails my entire life. Right before I began using Neutrogena's Instant Nail Enhancer (NINE), my nails were going through a very rough time - splitting, pealing, and breaking. I started using NINE and I have not suffered one broken nail since. My nails were weak and brittle, and since I began using NINE, there have been times when I hit my fingers on something that would have for sure broken a nail, and my nails did not break, even in their state of recovery from pealing. The pealing and splitting has stopped, and my nails are growing. I recommend giving NINE a try.I love that NINE dries immediately, and my nails always look polished.Way to go Neutrogena and thanks!!!"
3,defective bottles,"I love this stuff, and use one thin coat daily. If you put too much on or two coats, it will peel. Unfortunately, 2 of the 3 bottles I have the brush applicator tip broke off. It is now stuck in the lid and I can't use it."
4,Concise movement disorder book,This is not a reference book on movement disorders. Instead it is a concise book that deals w/ most aspects of movemnt disorders (including pediatric) w/out getting too detailed. This makes it perfect for the resident in training who wants to learn more about this division of Neurology. By far the best thing about this book is the included CD-ROM of videos.
3,Beware: Ideas only--No Plans!,"I should have known better from the title that this was just a book of photos. However, the photos are gorgeous and I often flip through it when I'm looking for something pretty to have a cup of tea with or to look at before I go to sleep. The houses are all kinds, all materials, and all inspiring. They try to sell you plans at the end."
4,"Another Sunset ""fluff"" piece","Actually, I liked this book. It has fantastic color photos of various cottages, cabanas, potting sheds, sleeping/dining sheds, greenhouses, trellises, etc.. If you are just skimming for visual ideas for what to build in somebody's back yard or vacation property, this book is ""tops"".Unfortunately there were no sketches or plans accompanying the pictures. So the reader is left unsure of how to reproduce what he sees. Also, the plans available for sale in the rear of the book are fine as far as they go -- but they don't have anything available if you want a cabana, trellis, or outdoor kitchen."
3,OK backyard cottages,The cover is better than the content. Disappointed in the lack of info and never could find more on the cottage that is shown on the cover. Just odd in my opinion.
4,ideas for great backyard cottages,accidently ordered 2 copies of same bookBooks were recieved by two different vendors but in ggood shape
5,Great Read - Timothy Ridge is an author to watch,"I really enjoyed this book and was tempted to read some of it again.""The Vampire Stone"" by Timothy Ridge is by far the best written. It's filled with great details about the locations and characters.So descript, you actually feel like you're right there in this sleepy Hudson River village. Articulate and exciting, the Vampire Stone's character Roceres, is devilish and sometimes frightening to the point of feeling real chills. The wooden box's contents keep you reading and the sex leaves you wondering, who is this guy and where did he learn to do that?...Mr. Ridge is an accomplished writer and I'll be looking out for him in bookstores more. The other stories were also great reads, which is why I gave Midnight Thirsts 2 fangs up!"
5,Grogan hits the mark with Solar Obsession,"While most videos in this industry get sidetracked with inaneattempts at comedy, Grogan's approach is more pure. He presents a hugeroster of today's cutting edge skaters, performing some of the mostspectacular maneuvers on 4 wheels. All shot on film (another industryrarity), with no boring filler, just the best skaters and the besttricks."
2,misting fan review,"This would be an excellent product but after 1 use one of the misting nozzles clogged, and also where the garden hose connects to the fan this has come undone after one use as well."
1,Company went under,Tried to get help but it looks like they company is no longer up and running. So if you are looking for any Windchaser product you better get a great deal and be sure it works and know if it can be returned for a refund since there is not going to be any warranty on there items for repair.
4,WindChaser Outdoor Misting Fan,Prompt delivery on the fan and it works just as advertised! One slight issue with the mister hose hitting the blades of the fan because it does not stay secured in a little pressure clamp on the face of the fan. A small plastic tie added security to the hose and the fan works great!
5,Just what the doctor ordered,"This fan is awesome! I took it out of the box, assembled it, hooked up the hose and let it fly. The mist sprays about 10-15 feet, depending on the speed you select. We had several outdoor parties during the sweltering heat and the fan was a godsend. Highly recommended for people who sit outside while small children play."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Execution","I looked at this and thought ""What a great idea!"". I ordered it, got it, put it together, turned it on, and realized that what I had was a very wet fan or a very bad lawn sprinkler. Bottom line - your municipal water pressure will not work to atomize the water enough so it is mostly evaporated by the time it hits you. You will get soaked if you stand too close, and the cooling is ineffective if you stand too far away. I can see you liking this if you want to cool the kids down while they play outside (and don't care about them getting wet) or if you are working on outdoor projects(and don't care about you getting wet). But for an evening of sitting around the patio with friends - it just isn't effective, and is just annoying."
3,Long ship time not worth the wait,"After waiting for over a month to receive the fan, found it had been repackaged and was missing parts (most likely the reason it was returned). Package came unsealed, obviously it had been previously opened and repackaged. Had to rig a screw to hold the fan to the base. Once connected, works fine, though drips constantly, not sure why yet."
4,Cool by the Pool!!,"I orginally bought this fan/mister to help deter the mosquitos! That did'nt work but it sure is nice to have in the heat. My only complaints are that the ""low"" setting is what I would consider ""high"" because you can set the fan 15' away and it's almost too much. The other complaint, the actual fan head does not adjust easily. I would really like to have the fan stand taller and the head more adjustable (up and down). Right now you are cooled from the waist down. I actually don't use the mister too much. It does not seem to blow far enough to cover your entire body if you're laying down on a chaise."
1,shaky,"To expensive for an outdoor fan. Built so fragile, small wind will blow it over. I can't imagine any good and safe use for it. Its best location is in the trash or the attic stored for your estate sale. Simply junk"
2,"All plastic,cheaply made fan",I now understand why this fan is so cheap.It is all plastic and you must assemble it yourself. Give it 2 stars for its low price.
3,Windchaser Fan,"My fan arrived missing a screen for the hose. I called and e-mailed the company. They e-mailed me that they didn't have a screen to send me. Disappointed, but it does mist ok and works, am hoping to get a hose screen from the hardware store before the fan clogs up."
2,"For the money I pay, shouldn't be any complain","The find some how spraying too much water. I get wet when I stay too close for a short period. I think the holes for ths spraying noddle should be smaller. As I said, for that amount of money I pay, I shouldn't have any complain."
2,"Great regular fan, fun for kids if you have no pool","I got this fan to cool off my lanai on hot, summer days. I know, I know ... in Florida the humidity is too high to allow an evaporative cooling fan to work. I had hoped to defy the physics and chill, but the only chill I got was when I was soaked through to the skin after about 10 minutes. And don't use this fan around upholstered outdoor furniture ... it's like leaving them out in the rain.My bad for buying something that would work great in the mountains of Colorado or the southwest deserts, where humidity is a desiccating 10 percent or so. In that environment, I expect this fan would work wonderfully. But if you live anywhere the humidity on a hot summer day exceeds 50 percent, save your money. You'll only use the fan part and that can be bought for a lot less than 100 bucks."
4,Great for Ooutdoors!,"This is a great outdoor fan and it really does mae those hot summer days more tolerable. However, unless you plan on getting wet, make sure you keep it far enough so that you and your guests don't get misted."
3,Cool in the south,"It was simple to assemble and it definitely cools down the temp. But with the humidity we already experience in the deep south, it adds a cover of dampness to anything within a few feet."
1,wind chaser will never get my money again,"I brought 2 wall fans from this company and 1 had the remote quit, the other had the blades quit. I decided since they were the same model I would just switch out the broken one with the one that still worked because I needed a fan in that room the most. Not only did those 2 not match up on a brack that should have been the same but I went to companies site to look at the manual. I found the fan as being sold in their product list, but they did have a manual for it (all other products but the one I needed) and they don't even cover it in the F.A.Q. section. So if you want to throw your money away by all means go right a head and throw your money away but if they can't make a good wall fan then I would not trust them for any thing that is more involved."
3,WindChaser Fans - a weakness,"We have been buying Windchaser Misting Fans for our farm for 5 or 6 years. We have 12 of them and we use them in the barns and shelters in all the pastures to keep our alpacas cool and hydrated in the hot summer months in Florida. We like the fans; on the whole they work well, BUT they are weak at the point where the stand enters the oscillating fan. We have had seven or eight fans break at this point and there seems no way we can easily repair them. If they fall or are knocked down by animals, they break. If the manufacturer could strengthen this section of the fan, it would be wonderful.Also, the nozzles where the water sprays easily get blocked with tiny impurities in the water supply. On a farm this is usually from a well and so the nozzles must be cleaned regularly to get maximum benefit.Gordon RatcliffClassic Alpacas, Dunnellon, Florida"
4,Cooling,"Easy assembly, screwdriver required, connections very simple. Provides adequate cooling for a smaller area but very effective. Only real downfall is no way to shut off water on the unit itself."
4,Yummy!,"I bought this chutney to make a recipe from a magazine I was reading. It was combined with orange sections, curry,etc. and served over chicken cutlets rolled in panko crumbs, then fried in olive oil. I cooked pork tenderloin slices the same way and it was delicious both times.Just the right amount of spice! A little pricey though."
4,"Good, but...","I like this but it has the following problems - a strangely bright orange color, rather than the darker colorof Indian brands; very, very sweet; way to chunky."
5,!,It met and exceeded my expectations. It was delicious and arrived in a timely fashion. Color me/us happy and satisfied campers. The Happy Harringtons.
4,High Energy and very motivational,"I saw an ad for the video a few months ago and decided to check it out. It was definitely a good decision. The workout in the Cardio Athletic kickbox video is high energy and motivational, I feel like the instructor (Eversly Forte) is actually in the room with me. The people in the video are real people and not world class athletes like some other kickboxing videos have. To my surprise there were low impact alternatives to all of the moves. It is easy to follow and the music is much better than the usual video music people are accustomed to. It is not a fancy production, but it is quite effective. I took a chance when buying this cardio kickboxing video, but it turned out to be a very good investment. I give it a big thumbs up."
5,Exactly like what you see,The product i received is of good quality. Its exactly what I thought it would be. I am very happy with my purchase. The item comes with buttons to sew onto your pants as well. :)
1,suckspender,one size does not fit all as advertise. Next time send something that actually fits the average population and not something from your overstock items that nobody buys.
5,Excellent Book,This is another wonderful book by Phyllis Root. The pictures are beautiful and the story has a dreamy rhythm that will help your child fall asleep. This is also a counting book. My son who is three loves this book.
2,Holy God is a better buy,If you want an album you will want to hear over and over again...Buy Holy God by Brain Doerksen.
5,You will be very pleased with this!,"I've had all types of paper planners over the years. I decided to purchase the slim planner this time from Day-Timer in the ""Armorhide"" and took a chance.This thing works well for carrying around and won't get in the way like the thicker planners. It fits under a car seat and feels comfortable when carrying.Buy the separate parts-and-pieces for this and customize this great binder yourself. Or, if you want, buy it complete. You can't go wrong and even though the price is a bit higher than most for the planners, you'll be glad you spent a little more on this."
5,Superb,"I first purchased these performances of the late quartets on vinyl back in the early to mid 1970's. I have listened to these wonderful performances many times over the years, and I just don't get tired of them. I have four of five other versions of the Beethoven quartets, and certainly, there are other great recordings of these works, but for clarity, precsion, attack, pesuasive power, sheer beauty of sound, I just keep coming back to the QI. At a cost of two CD's for the price of one, this is a terrific deal on arguably the best version of these quartets ever recorded. I can't think of any reason not to purchase this -- except that you can buy a boxed set of all the quartets for about [price]."
1,NOT Beethoven - Listen to previews of #15 before Purchasing!,"Listen to the previews of #15 BEFORE PURCHASING!!!I downloaded this and instead of Quartet No. 15 (the one I most wanted, but of course all are great) was NOT the Quartet at all! It was a Baroque group of Arias, -very nice, BUT NOT even BEETHOVEN! I complained to Amazon, who returned my money and said I could repurchase and it would be corrected ""in a week or two."" This was yesterday, March, 6, 2011. How are we to know when the problem is ""corrected???"" I don't know, but BEWARE! at least for the next 2 weeks!Playing the previews again now, it is NOT Beethoven, even now, so you will probably be okay if more than 2 weeks after Mar 6, 2011 and the previews are of the Beethoven... but if not, DO NOT PURCHASE!"
5,MUST HAVE ALBUM,This is one of the best album you can ever get. Never get bored listening to it. Greatest love song -> PAINT MY LOVE . Lyric is so deep. MUST HAVE!!!
5,MLTR rox!,Well what can I say? This is a hell of an album. It is really worth every cent and maybe more. MLTR does a great job and that shows in the greatest hits album. Every song of this is a masterpiece. I recommend this to all bryan adams and boyzone fans.
4,"Not the most innovative style, but pleasing, fun.","Michael Learns to Rock is not original sounding music, but there's a lot to be enjoyed here. I like that the lyrics are clean and positive. I found all of their songs either fun or beautiful. I like their singing harmony and their mild 80's rock sound. Some of my favorite songs on this CD: Sleeping Child, Paint My Love, Out of the Blue, 25 Minutes, and Someday."
4,A Must Read,"In the past, we could use Chicago or Philadelphia as models of the urban reality; however, the United States is rapidly becoming a more racially and ethnically diverse nation. The model of this current reality is Los Angeles. ""Prismatic Metropolis: Inequality in Los Angeles"" addresses questions of how race and ethnicity, space, gender and group identities and attitudes are linked in complex ways that result in divergent opportunities in the population. The editors (Lawrence D. Bobo, Melvin L. Oliver, James H. Johnson Jr. and Abel Valenzuela Jr.) and a distinguished group of younger scholars cover demographic transitions, economic restructuring, residential segregation, and the interplay of group identity, attitudes, and the dynamics of workplace interactions. ""Prismatic Metropolis"" is an essential starting place for understanding urban society in the 21st Century."
5,Super fun!,"The more people playing this game, the more fun it gets. GREAT for parties! The best part is when you curse someone like my mom so that she can' t bend her elbows, has to dance with her arms each time she talks, and has to keep her hands balled into fists. Great fun to watch!"
5,Super Game,This game is great. It allows for tons of laughter and endless fun even after the game is done. :)
4,So much Fun,I ordered this game because my family and I over heard another family playing this game one weekend camping. The game arrived quickly and as described. We have invited friends over to play and it is very entertaining.
1,No Instructions,We received this and opened it up -only to discover it came with no instructions. Looks like it could be fun. Guess we'll see if we can find some instructions online. Buzz kill for the New Years Party that's for sure!
3,Curse Tragedy,"This game was pretty fun. When you are cursed you have to do whatever your curse card tells you, like you can't bend your elbows, or something like that. For me, however, the game was getting already getting long when it ended tragically. I had a curse card that said I had to act like I was electrocuted whenever someone touched me. As the other players were rushing to electrocute me, one stepped on my foot and broke my toe. He said he was sorry."
4,Curses fun with the right people,"The first time my family played this game, my parents weren't into it and it made the game slow and boring. We tried playing a second time with a bigger group of people who really got into the game and we laughed the entire time!"
4,Great Fun!,Love this game especially when you add beverages! Unfortunately this isn't a great game for the same group multiple times. If you hang out with various groups it is a lot of fun though!
5,great songs!,"I love it, my daughter loves it too, the songs are very creative and alive. I play it in my car over and over after we heard the ""Yoyitos Vol I""So grateful to have a ""Vol 2""."
4,A REVIEW,"The F-18 Hornet is an aircraft highly rated and hard to review. However, this book includes insight and the things I really wanted to see and couldn't with anything else (sorry ""JANES""). Good information and coverage on specific points really made this book a good read and stare."
4,Excellent Modeler Resource-Typical Verlinden,"Excellent detail shots of entire airplane, This is a Walk-around type Picture book for hardcore enthusiasts. Very little to no aircraft history, operational stories, pics of different squadron markings, etc. But those are available elsewhere. This is a reference for the serious modeler, If you are interested in the actual mechanics of the Bug this book would go very nicely with a maintenance manual so you can figure out what all those black boxes and parts actually do. Typical verlinden book, a thousand shots of one or two planes in gruesome detail."
4,Will it work?,"I think this vehicle was really great except the figures who were intended for it(Obi-Wan and Anakin)don't fit!Now being a Star Wars fan I would really like to see this work,so I was wondering will the upcoming Obi-Wan and Anakin figures fit?I would really like to know."
4,Mistaken for...,"Several people have confused this wartime 'short' with the movie made in 1990. This Memphis Belle is a US propaganda file covering the last (25th) mission of the famous B-17 bomber named 'The Memphis Belle'. (after a young lady the crew met during training) During WWII US Army Air Corps bomber crews could be rotated back to the USA to training bases after 25 missions. As the anti-aircraft defenses around the Axis countries were the best in the world at the time, few crewmembers could make the magic number of 25. The Belle was the first to make it with a intact (read alive and uninjured) crew. The USAAC filmed this event through recreation and stock footage.Dont get me wrong. Any WWII history buff should grab a copy of this film. It is a fathful and well done view of a mission in a B-17 over Germany during WWII. You just have to remember it was a propaganda film. But see this one before seeing the 1990 movie."
4,Memphis Belle,Great to see real footage as opposed to a movie. A whole different scenario when you are shooting and being shot at.
5,The greatest WW2 film ever!!,This is the best film ever...the graphics are fantastic and you are sitting on the edge of your seat throughout most of the film.What really brings it to life is the fact that it's based on a true story. Go and see it whenever you have a spare moment and you'll want to watch it over and over again.
2,Not very informative,"This video is only about 43 minutes long. Image quality is not real good, having been produced from 16mm original film. It is a brief representation of only one mission. The film teaches very little about the Flying Fortresses, WWII, or air war in general."
3,A little disappointing,"The film had deteriorated and/or the transfer to DVD wasn't the best. Also, I was hoping for several interviews with the crew, and coverage of what happened to them after they returned to the States. Nope......While it's a decent supplement to the movie, it could have been more. I'm glad I got it, though."
1,Watch out!!!,If you are expecting the WWII action movie beware. This is a low budget adult film. (The low price) really is too good to be true.
3,"Girls on film and Girls/Girls On Film,Yeah !","Stars: Seth Cassell.Seth was in SEXPOT-a 3D cult hit from Theasylum.In his second feature he is the best friend of a guy who looks alot like Val Kilmer,When HE looked like Val Kilmer !This comedy is pretty good and alot of scenes are stolen by Charlene Tilton and her scenery chewing.There are strippers,girl on girl scenarios,and alot of funny spots.This is classic NATIONAL LAMPOON feel to it and Naomi Selfman (script) and Mark Quod (director) delivered a funny 90 minutes."
1,One Star is not low enough,"I had the same thoughts as above, but what the heck. The author is opinionated, inaccurate, and arrogant in the extreme. Everyone has a right to his or her own opinion, but not in a ""buyers"" guide. It is okay to praise, but...well, if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. As mentioned in a previous review, Sam Frank's taste is highly questionable, and he rams it down the reader's throat. Quite frankly, the author's comments indicate a jerk. Not worth one's time or money. A real waste of space."
1,I couldn't use the romanisation for Cantonese,"Borderline OK if you are interested in the characters and learning basic mandarin, but I couldn't follow the IPC romanisation for the Cantonese. If you want to learn Cantonese, this book is only good for people who can follow IPC or can read traditional Chinese characters. Ok if you are learning (basic) Mandarin, the Mandarin translation is in Pinyin (and simplifed Chinese), but i'm sure there are better books to buy for this purpose. One benefit is that I could end up learning IPC from this book if I really wanted to put the effort in - but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this book for this purpose."
2,4 super short stories,"this book contains four mediocre short stories. i didn't find them anything special and though i gravitated to the book because i have gotten to like lori foster's work, i found her story to be especially disappointing. i suppose if you are looking for a quick summer read, this will do, but beware for you may be a bit bothered when you finish."
2,Mixed bag,"The first two stories in this anthology -- by Lori Foster and Laura Bradley -- were definitely ""hot,"" but the second two stories just, well, bothered me. The historical story set in the sixteenth century was both dull and out of place among the other contemporary love stories. I wanted to like Victoria Marquez' contribution because of its latina heroine, but frankly the ending was just too unbelievable. Still, Lori Foster's story was *almost* worth the book. Almost."
4,I love it/ Great Simpson Figures,"Hi,I love the Simpsons and these are great to have.They do resemble Simpson charactor.Even though the the Ages are 4+, and I'm almost 10, I still love these figures very much!This is certainly a way to start collectiong Simpsons products."
5,Exactly what I got,"What you see is what you get. Product came in exact looking condition as picture, individually packaged, and safely sealed. Mechanical functions are in good shape. All in all I got what I paid for."
1,Loudsy fan,This fan is the worst I have encountered so far. It rattles even at low speed. It would definitely keep you up at night. I have one frm Holmes and it is much quieter.
2,2 year service plan - know what that means,"Be aware, these plans run concurrent with the manuafacturer's warranty. If the manufacturer provides a 1 year warranty, you are really getting only one additional year of coverage.The product description does not spell this out. Sure, it's a 2 year service plan, I guess. But it doesn't state anything about when it begins, I assumed I was getting 2 years of additional warranty coverage. Wrong. It starts with the purchase date, so I'm getting one additional year. You find that out when you receive the plan.The seller contacted me, via email, about previous negative feedback I posted. Their quick response and desire to rectify the situation prompted me to pull the feedback. Should have left it as is. They could do nothing about the terms. When they stated ""rectify"", they must have meant explain it to me, cause that's all I got."
1,not useful for engineer or designer.,Most of the solutions provided by the book are differential equations or a bunch of formulae that has nothing to do with solving a real life engineering solution. It may give you some concepts but it won't help you solve any real problem.
3,Good but not great,A good reference source to search for other more specific books and papers but not enough practical data to do the design calculations I was hoping to find.A good starting point for an HVAC novice.
3,Too Much Info,"This book is good if you're a college professor. I needed something more straight forward and basic for my ventilation needs. And, for the cost, it was not worth it."
5,Comprehensive,"This is a book for those who want to modify and develop ""standard solutions"" or do not trust them. It requires some effort to use, but the reward is the access to a solid and comprehensive scientific basis for the design of ventilation systems for contaminant control.The chapter Design Methodology guides you through a systematic and holistic design process."
5,Heaven thru Music,the Brilliance and importance of Beethoven's Late String Quartets is a given. Suffice it to say that this is one of the loveliest recordings both in performance and sonic qualities. Not to be missed is the 1st Movement of Op 127 - which explores of B's most haunting lyrical melodies - just about as close to heaven on earth you'll get. - performed with absolute perfection.
1,Sorry customer Support,"I would not recommend buying anything from Windchaser. Their customer support department is lacking. If you can get through on the phone good luck, I have been trying for months. They do not answer thier emails either, Sirry company."
1,Piece of Junk with the Worst Costumer Service,Tray gets stuck and ice maker shuts down. It was # 8 on the FAQ so it must be a common problem. Tried to get help but it looks like they company is no longer up and running. So if you are looking for any Windchaser product you better get a great deal and be sure it works and know if it can be returned for a refund since there is not going to be any warranty on there items for repair.
2,Is Windchaser Defunct?,I've had my machine for 2-3 years. I need a replacement part and have been trying to get some one on the phone or to return my email for over two weeks. I think they must be in bankruptcy or something because they sure don't seem to care about customer service. Once I got sent to the operator voice mail and got a message that the voice mailbox was full.
3,Where is the Ice?,"I purchased this Ice maker two year ago. It has been wonderful for the most part other then having to reset it often. Anyway, we put up with that as it is a fairly new thing of late. This ice maker has been going around the clock for two years solid and we use a lot of ice. It has kept up with our needs for the most part. Last night it finally gave it up and refused to be reset or make ice. So, I am going to have to get another one. I am a bit disapointed that it hasn't lasted longer. I still have my grandfathers GE Freezer from the 1930's that still gives great service and I have never had it repaired. So much for things that last forever or at least a long time. One other thing... My old freezer is a lot quieter then this small little icemaker or at least until today."
1,Total waste of money,"After one day of operation the machine indicated it was out of water. It wasn't, but because the machine insisted it was, it stopped and refused to work. Service calls and adjustments were to no avail. We just listed it on the '""free"" section of Craigslist in the hopes that someone will take it out of here."
4,Pump,I need to replace the pump in the unit.Could you please sell me one or tell me where to find oneThank youJoe gatt
1,BJ's Price Clube for $149.00,"It isn't a windchaser, but a permaSteel. same specs. Can't find ""permasteel"" anywhere on the net. but it is 1/2 the cost of Windchaser."
2,"It makes ice, but . . .","I bought my WC in Nov 2004 through Amazon (best price, incredibly fast arrival) after comparison shopping with other mfrs/sellers for a week or so. It worked as promised until last month-noisy but efficient so it sits in the basement cranking out cubes. The cubes are ""spongy"" but transferring them to a container in our refrigerator's freezer compartment door firms them up in short order. Now the PROBLEMS: Last month, it started continually making ice regardless of whether the bin is full. The auto-shut-off also stopped working so it tries to make ice even when the reservoir is empty (although those little ""caps"" of ice are pretty cute). A one-star review here from June(?) '05 noted that the manufacturer was less than sympathetic. I plan on calling them today and will follow up in another posting on whether I have the same experience.Regards, jhjorg WashDC"
1,CUSTOMER SERVICE NIGHTMARE,"I bought my ice maker from Amazon in September. Good price, prompt delivery. But in November, I was on the phone to Windchaser's nightmarish customer service department to replace some cheap plastic parts that broke and then in March to replace the whole unit because it began producing irregular sized ice. By the middle of July I still had not received the promised replacement and am dreading having to call them again!"
1,Winchaser Products - False Customer Service Phone #,"Try it yourself. Look on the Internet and get the phone numbers for Windchaser Products and call.You will hear that either you have dialed the wrong number or the phone has been disconnected.I'm surprised that Amazon sells their products. If Amazon continues to do so, they lose credibility.WindChaser Outdoor Misting Fan"
5,Dragonball GT Episodes 61-64,"well being from uk and we have already seen all of these episodes i will give you a sneak peek, goku uses one of his favourites to defeat evil shenron, then the dragon appears and you find out something about where goku going and vegetain the last episode there a big hint that a following dragonball series might be created cause it is left opoen for it"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"Of all the teen bibles I looked at, this one had the busyist cover. Don't judge a book by it's cover, I guess! However, inside was a pleasant surprise. The inserts were placed appropriately, not distracting from the bible contents. It was easy to hold and the print was easily read, unlike some teenage bibles I've looked at."
2,Condition mis represented,"The product was listed like new. However, the product was more like in fair or poor condition.- big crack in the front of the case- sticky residue on the back of the case- sticker on the booklet was half torn off and left a residue that cannot be removed"
3,BEWARE,"Although I love the motif of this bedding set and did purchase it for our new arrival, beware that it DOES NOT HAVE BOTTOM BUMPER TIES. As a pediatrician, I can tell you this is not safe and is a health risk. I am sewing ribbon onto the bottom of the bumper to use as bottom ties to fix the problem. Everything else about the set I love (sheet 100% cotton, fits standard mattress well, quilt with a wall-hanging option)."
4,Adorable,I am having a boy in August and I thought that this bedding was really cute. The color was easy to match fabrics I am using on the glider and other accessories. The only problem is there are no ties on the bottom of the bumper. I am going to sew ribbon to the bottom of the bumper because of this SAFETY HAZARD.Congrats to all new mothers!
1,Did not work with PCG700ML,"I installed this new board on my Genie Powermax2 PCG700ML, and it would not work properly. Seemed like the limiters were not working as it would close for a few inches and pop back up. Adjusted the force control all the way up, rechecked everything and unplugged and plugged back in, and still no luck. Put my old board in and it worked fine again (except the code learning button, which is why I ordered a new board)."
4,Can't believe I'm Giving Nels Cline only 4 stars!,I got all three trio records at one time from little brother and this one didn't strike me as hard as the others. For that reason i just haven't listened to it that much. Maybe it will grow on me more in the future. It is Nels Cline after all.
4,Excellent word for word copy of all of the available Out of Copyright original Tom Swift adventures...,The only real down side is that the way that the individual books are organized; you will need to work with a wiki to be able to read the books within sequence. Otherwise a superior value and a real window into life during the early 20th century.
4,science prod,I like it - brings back my childhood - it is a science prod for kids and me - thanks for the product from my kidhood
1,You misled me and your other customers,"I found this collection while searching for Tom Swift, Jr. books by Victor Appleton II. The product appears to be advertised as a 17 book collection of those stories, but it is not. The cover shows Tom Swift Jr in space, but what you get is 27 books of the original Tom Swift collection by Victor Appleton. While those stories are wonderful in the writing, I already own most of them for my Kindle and didn't plan to purchase them a second time."
1,Way too predictible for my taste.,"Girl forgets diary in hotel room. Boy finds diary, boy reads diary. Boy has to return diary and meet girl. Etc. We all know how it ends. They hook up of course. Search your feelings, you know this too be true. I fell asleep five times while trying to get through this book."
2,Ben was great but Sam was a [fuss],"I am sorry, but the female character, Sam, in the book just never got likeable. She was a [fuss] from the word go. The character of Ben was great, but Sam never developed beyond her starting character. Very dissapointing for such a fun premise."
2,Witty and sometimes humorous but overall confusing,"Jane Sigaloff's romantic and humorous novel ""Lost and Found"" can be comical and witty at times but if you get down to it, its just not clearly written. The words all seem to run together, interferring with the mood of the book. The main character Sam Washington(a young london lawyer) is a total head case. She ""loses"" her self after leaving her preceous diary in a New York hotel room. Ben Fisher, the man that finds her diary, serches for her to return it. Sam, terrified that someone(Ben) has read it, is in a complete fuss. But something strange happens between the two....romance??? Personaly i found the book confusing at times. The book jumped around in so many different directions(sam obsessing over work,and her love life, Ben reading Sam's diary, and her friends putting in their two sence), i sometimes caught myself wondering what was going on. I also found the main character Sam a bite annyoing and to much to handle."
3,Pace is off; characters too predictable,"I knew exactly who was going to end up with whom, and anybody described as ""scruffy-looking"" is an immediate turn-off for me. Sure, I'm up on a lot of British slang and pop culture references, but it was still a difficult and uneven read. The lead character was too predictable (as was the outcome) and the whole book was poorly executed."
4,Ultimately a wonderful read,"What made this book irritating at first eventually was what made it hard to put down. The author, Jane Sigaloff, writes in a fashion that has you rereading to figure out whose head you're in, what the American translation is of the English you just read, and wondering what happened and whose mind just changed in the space between paragraphs. But as difficult to follow as that sounds, after a few chapters it's absolutely addictive. I liked not having absolutely everything spelled out, but seeing the result of the change of heart/plans/what have you. One minute the characters are in disaccord, the next they agree. It was definately worth the money a larger paperback like this usually costs, and I'm looking forward to finding her first book, _Name and Address Withheld_ to enjoy her writing style some more."

4,Simply Beautiful,"The Shine soundtrack was a wonderful accompaniment to the movie, and it is a great addition to any classical music library. The music is both uplifting and empowering. But if you buy this CD for only one reason buy it for the magnificent rendition of Vivaldi's Nulla in Mundo Pax Sincera by the angelic-sounding soparano Jane Edwards. Simply beautiful!"
5,Beautiful Music,There is a blend of published music with new haunting music which tells the story. I seldom buy CDs but this was a must have for me.
4,offers both more and less than I wanted,"I ordered the CD after seeing the movie, which was quite wonderful. I was hoping to hear some of the pieces in their entirety, which, of course, is not what a soundtrack is about. It did guide me to other CDs for the music I wanted. The soundtrack is well-worth having, however, and is quite ""lush."""
2,le son sature.,"la musique est vraiment tres bien, mais l'enregistrement à un défaut, il y a de la saturation dès la première plage et il y en a encore plus tard dans d'autres plages. dommage, et ; inacceptable."
4,Good Soundtrack,"It was a great deal. I loved the movie and the music so I got it. Though I disappointed little, because I wanted to hear more of the classic music played in the movie. But this is the soundtrack of the movie so it has all music from the movie scenes and it bring us back the momory of each moment when they are played. So, this is good for you who love the movie."
5,Soothing and Soaring,"Serah has the uncanny ability to bring together incredible musicians from all over the globe and make an album that sounds as though they've all been working together for years. Her voice is very pure and direct, and over the rich layers of music supplied by the musicians, it is pure magic.The message of her music is very clear, and even when she deviates from her own original songs to cover oldies like ""Sailing"" and ""Stand By Me"", her interpretations never stray.If you're looking to be inspired by beautiful melodies and images, or if you just want something soothing in the middle of all the chaos, I highly reccomend Late Harvest."
2,"OK, BUT PROBLEMS WITH HUMIDISTAT","As far as taking water out of the air, this unit does fine. I have had problems with the humidistat/control panel since purchasing this unit. I have called customer service 3 times and each time they have sent me a new control panel. Once installed, the unit works fine for like 1 day and then the same problem happens again! Sooooo frustrating! The problem is, the fan runs constantly. It is supposed to shut off when the air reaches the humidity set, but the unit will not shut off! I have had this unit for a few months. I with I had returned it when I had the chance. Today I placed an order for a Frigidaire model that I hope will be better."
5,"Beautifully made, light and durable","We have had Calphalon for years, and my wife has always complained about the weight. I haven't liked the special cleanup (using Dormond cleanser instead of the dishwasher.) This pan is terrific; lightweight, a breeze to clean. It is beautifully made, and looks beautiful as well."
5,Great Cologne!,I have used this cologne for years. It is my favorite. Very fresh and always seems to draw positive comments.
3,Tsar,I usually use the eau de toilette but thought the cologne would be stronger but it isnt and it is a an entirely different scent. Its not bad its just not the same as the toilette
1,10 year old Tsar,"I recieved an old bottle of Tsar. It was sealed and in the bottle they have not used in many years, obviously an old bottle. The cologne is so old it has very little frangrance left. It does not smell anything like the other bottles I have bought recently. Whatever supplier Amazon used for this fragrance can not be trusted to supply you with the product as pictured."
3,A definitive First in mixed company,"I can only echo what the Amazon reviewers have said about Previn's great recording of Elgar's First Symphony. At this two-fer price, it's worth getting this set for the First alone--but the remainder of this 2-CD set is more variable. Previn's recording of the Second Symphony is less successful; in fact, it only starts to come to life about halfway through. The ""Pomp & Circumstance"" Marches 1-5 and ""Cockaigne"" Overture are okay, but there are better performances of these. Another bargain-priced duo with more consistently fine performances of both symphonies is available on Virgin Classics conducted by the late Yehudi Menuhin, who as a teenager performed Elgar's Violin Concerto under the composer's direction."
5,No kitchen should be without a box of this stuff!,"In the land of cubed bouillon, there are 3 remaining contenders for the""Best Of"" title. There's Maggi, Goya (which is not a Jewish company OK)and Knorr. They are all similar, and all in different cost categories,but this is the most easily found cube bouillon locally.These 3 brand names are all great, but this is the one I've used for yearsand years. It effectively replaced Wyler's about 10 years ago when Wyler'sdecided to start making chicken bouillon that tastes like burnt plastic.This stuff is great for making rice, grits, and for explosive flavors insoups and sauces. The flavor is so rich that it actually makes a good standin for chicken stock. I use 5 of these in a pot of Soup Nazi's Chicken Chili,and only use stocks for very special dishes. Its that good!Nestle is the parent company, and they have a million products but this greatfoundational product hasn't been corporatized yet, lets keep it that way OK!"
2,over priced,"This is a great item for ppl who have no fireplace, small spaces or too many stockings (like me) for the fireplace. [...]"
4,Exactly as described,"These were exactly as described style 3393 color suntan (82) and delivery was on time. these are heavy and would be fine for winter outdoor skating. They do not suit my purposes, but it is my mistake. the reason for 4 stars is that the package had been opened before and resealed with tape, but the item did not seem to have been wornAlas,these were not what I really wanted to wear under short skirts, etc in the summer. I learned that what I really wanted was the 3312 semi opaque in color 24 which is not as orange as the suntan color."
4,Major Cooling Action,"We bought this fan for our bedroom and even on low, it's too cold to sleep without a comforter completely covering us. I love the remote control and timer features. The fan is quiet and will easily cool down a large room. We don't have A/C and it's the only fan we own. I agree that it isn't ideal to only be able to control certain features (including oscillation) with the remote control, and the fan isn't overly sleek or modern in appearance, which keeps it from being a 5 star product, but overall an excellent fan!"
1,Fan is garbage,We bought two of these fans about a year ago. Neither fan was used very much except on the occasional days in the summer when we didn't have our air conditioning on. One fan is now totally inoperative and the other doesn't oscillate and doesn't work at high speed. Don't even think about buying this fan!!!!
1,poor performance,"I bought this fan in the winter and just start to use it this summer. The fan is very loud for the mid and high speed. And even with high speed, the fan is not cool enough. The remote control is hard to use. It can only control the fan in certain angle. And it's now melt functioned within two weeks. The design is very stupid, I can only control on/off and the speed without the remote control. With my remote control melt functioned, I can not even make the fan to oscillate. Totally not satisfied with the quality. I will never buy any WindChaser product again."
2,JustUs,"I have to admit it was a bit shocking seeing all of the guys together. Don't get me wrong it was a good shock.However, the video is only 30 minutes long. Not nearly long enough for us to get to visit each monkee. I am a little disappointed with the video, although the songs they were singing weren't so bad, it's just I wish it could have been longer."
3,Old Monkees Never Die,"Over the course of too many years to recall one of the things that was always comforting was that some things-like the monkees-would always be a part of ""magic youth"". Alas those days are gone. The album and the video of Justus are fine for what they are-but they arn't much monkee. In a world of glitzy music videos that are all gloss Justus is just that--all gloss and polish. These songs and videos are too laboured over. A monkee's album or TV show should have something fresh or different. It's too bad...old monkess never die they just move into the 90's and beyond. And that is not always a good thing."
2,"Okay for a cheap modem, but...","I bought this just to use PhoneTray. Works adequately for that but Windows XP will not automatically detect and enable it on boot. You need to manually unplug and replug the USB connector for it to work (in other words, a manual plug-and-play). I've read online that this is a common problem with the Conexant modem IC it uses.You get what you pay for..."
3,Fine for XP and Older Operating Systems,"It's surprising, but there are no drivers available for Vista or Windows 7. Once I move all systems to Windows 7 (or 8), this modem will be useless. It works fine with XP, but nothing later."
1,Terrible product,"As another reviewer mentioned, you have to unplug/plug everytime you use it. That gets old. I bought this for my mother who has dialup and even she is sick of it. Worked for 4 months. Now it really doesn't work at all. Dials up when it wants to. I'm trashing it and buying another brand of USB external modem. I'll never buy this brand again.NOTE: I did not buy it from Amazon. I bought it from another popular online retailer."
2,Stray Cats CD,I had heard a particular Stray Cats song on the radio. I was disappointed to find that the version of the song on the CD was not the same version that I had heard on the radio. I wish there had been a way to hear the songs or bits of the songs before I purchased the CDThe Very Best Of The Stray Cats: Rumble in Brixton
4,Easy to put together,I don't know why some people have trouble with this. I put it together myself in about 15 minutes.The only caveat I have is that the top had warped a bit and sloped down in the middle which causes the doors to have to be pushed in. Not a deal breaker but slightly troublesome.
3,"Great shed, poor packaging/or delivery handling.","We have an older model of this shed that we bought locally 14 years ago. It held up great, aside from a few raccoon and squirrel scratching attacks at the birdseed within, and a slightly cracked roof that the manufacturer states can't be replaced because of a model discontinuance. We didn't accept this shed upon delivery because it was apparent there was damage to the unit, even before opening it. Crunched plastic edges peaked out at us, and no extra padding was evident. Will buy another locally."
3,Acceptable,"Definitely a two-person assembly job. I was furious when I saw on the instruction sheet that a rubber mallet was required for assembly, as that hadn't been stated in the product description and is not a common household tool in my opinion. However, we were able to assemble it without a mallet. Took two of us almost an hour.I wouldn't trust this shed to stand up to heavy storms, but in my partially sheltered urban backyard in mild California, it should be fine."
1,Sides will bow out,"If I had written this review a year ago, I would have given the shed 5 stars. However, after 1 year of service, the sides bowed out so much that the shelves fell off. I only had a few plastic pots and hand tools on the shelves, so weight was not an issue, and I live in a temperate climate, so I don't think it was weather.To fix it required me to take everything out of the shed, completely disassemble it, reassemble it (now, of course, without the instructions). Even after doing this, it was still bowing out, so out came the trusty duct tape (pictures uploaded). It can now hold shelves again, but I'm not sure how long this will last, and of course, it's pretty ugly.In short, extremely disappointing product, no durability at all."
2,warped and fell down,this shed is a useful size and irritating but simple to assemble. It is vulnerable to heat and cold. our one warped and then fell down on a windy day. caveat emptor
1,What a piece of crap,"This shed is a piece of junk! I bought it in August and assembled it per Rubbermaid's instructions. It was sitting on a platform of pavers, very level, for 3 months and a week. Then for some reason, the shed buckled in the middle of the left panel under 50 lbs or so of weight on the 2 shelves. Rubbermaid states the shed can handle 100lbs of undistributed weight. I put it back together, and a month after that it collapsed again, under 30 lbs of paint on the shelves. I called Rubbermaid, and they want to send me a side panel, instead of replacing it. Bull! This shed is Recycle #2 and that's where it's heading. Good work Rubbermaid, you lost a customer for good."
1,Forget it if it's windy,"I was really happy to have found this since it was the perfect thing that I needed, but I ended up having to throw it away after trying and trying to keep it from falling apart during any harsh weather by putting bungee cords around it, or fiddling with the grooves in the molded plastic that are the only thing keeping it together (note it's very easy to mangle the plastic to make it look like it's your own damn fault for not being able to put it together properly). Yeah, it's pretty windy here at times, but I'm not talking hurricane/tornado. Maybe my experience was atypical but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone for fear they'd have the same frustrating and expensive experience if they wanted to use it in a non-sheltered space, like, say, maybe your yard or deck where you might think to put it."
5,"Great product, well managed delivery...",The product is very easy to put together and is water proof. It fit everything we needed into it. The shipping was fast and they even brought the product all the way into the apartment for us.
5,Great Product,"Very fast shipping. Solid and easy to put together. Great little shed for keeping those ""everyday"" tools close to hand."
3,NO SHELVES?,"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT IS SO HARD TO FIND SHELVES FOR THIS PRODUCT, WHEN THERE ARE GROVES AND SLOTS FOR THE SHELVES,WHERE DO YOU GET THE SHELVES?SKY"
4,Good Value Outside Storage,"The Rubbermaid Vertical Storage Shed suits my outside storage needs well and is good value for money.I fairly quickly made and installed one wooden shelf and incorporated a wooden stiffener below it at the back so that I could install screw hooks for hanging saws and other garden implements.While the assembly instructions were appropriate, it took patience and care to get the components together without damaging them. I was successful, but be careful where and how hard you strike with your rubber mallet.I installed my shed under the deck out of direct sunlight. Visiting a garden center where one was in use out in the open, it was clear that things had warped pretty badly, so I would be careful in choosing a shady location for your shed."
4,Rubbermaid Storage Shed 3749,"Product was shipped as promised and assembled in the time estimated on the box. Very pleased with the item,it is perfect for the function I bought it for: storing garden tools, pool supplies, power washer and some other odds and ends.Julian"
4,Cheaper at Ace Hardware,"Amazon is way out of line with the price of this storage shed. Ace has it listed for $299, with free shipping to your local store. Lowes is even worse - $474. What are they thinking?"
4,Works as advertised,"I searched all over for this product. In San Jose, CA, Amazon beat Home Depot by about $50+tax and shipping. Home Depot actually wanted $85 for delivery. Amazon charged about $50, so it was kind of a no-brainer.The shed, itself was pretty easy to set up. Other reviewers commented that it was not a place to store valuables. I would tend to agree with that assessment. For storing common gardening tools and chemicals, it works great. The shed comes with shelf racks molded into the sides. You have to cut the shelves yourself, but the dimensions are in the instructions. They add a nice place to put smaller items. All in all I am pretty satisfied and have been thinking of maybe ordering another."
5,Great buy!!,"We are very happy with our purchase, the storage is sturdy and was very easy to put together.Just exactly what we were looking for.Delivery was promt as promised."
2,Initial opinion-setup today-UPDATE,"After 1 month...too much of a hassle to return it. Plastic door lock mechanism is sloppy, so it doesn't totally close. Should have been made out of some kind of metal. At least the unit hasn't collapsed, and no rain water has leaked inside.Original review:Not really sure why this storage shed gets glowing reviews. I set it up today, and noticed a potential problem....and may return it. My major concern is it seems that the panels appear to be too flimsy for a shed that large...even after being perfectly assembled. Nearly 10 years ago, I bought a Rubbermaid shed from Home Depot that looks like #3747, but the panels appear to be of more durable material than the new 3746. I will be checking it especially during the hot days, although it is fairly well protected from direct sunlight. At least, it is reasonably good looking for a shed, plus there's plenty of storage space. Hope it's more durable than I think it is...."
4,SANYO WINE COOLER,"Functions as advertised. Instructions were complete. Could be upgraded by having Sanyo install a thermometer.The unit visually is the equal of other hardware in the kitchen annex where it sits on a counter.I am going to install some exterior side wall insulation blocks covered with thin veneer hardwood to reduce cold loss. To the hand, the box insulation must not be quite thick enough to retain more cold.Bottom line: I would do it again."
5,Landa,"During the sixteenth century, the Franciscan friar Diego de Landa put into writing the Relacion de Las Cosas de Yucatan. This work is a translation of the manuscript from 1566 by the renowned scholar William Gates. The Dover edition was originally published as Publication Number 20 by the Maya Society, Baltimore, 1937. This was reportedly the first English translation of that text. Landa's relacion pieced together the culture and society of the Yucatec Maya as he saw the people, their practices and their region during his time. Although his work may be labeled as ""Euro centric"" by our standards, his writings are an early example of ethnographical accounts by a foreign observer. Diego de Landa has left scholars a view into the perceptions of a sixteenth century European clergyman as he encountered a foreign culture."
4,Good book,You have to like archaeology to enjoy this. I do and reading account from the first whites in the area was interesting.
2,Yucatan Before and After the Conquest (Native American),"Diego de Landa was a criminal in my eyes and also every MayaAll the Christians after him were also criminalsHis accounts gives some truth about Maya, the great things he destroyed it by burning their booksI would have killed him also"
5,"Very technical, very useful for intermed/advanced archers","I own quite a few (probably too many!) books on archery. After a while they all start to sound the same, NOT SO with this book. It details the exact mucles and bones used in shooting a bow. It has many excellent labelled drawings so the techincal language is easier to follow than you would think. I have rotator cuff trouble and this book really helped me with this. Explanations of how to hold the string are particularly good. I do not recommend this for beginners, you really should start with a less technical book. Otherwise it's an excellent value."
1,Underwhelmed,"This is a very poor documentary.I was shocked at how bad the voice over quality was(about as bad as it gets) to start the show, and the recap of WWI was lacking in depth and writing skills.The documentary lacks any focus and is really only music with video.I actually would not consider this a documentary, because there is nothing to learn from watching this.I would not recommend this video, but do recommend that Amazon take this video off of their list of videos to rent."
1,A complete waste,"I just wasted my time and money starting this one up. I should have read the first review. I agree that this should be removed, or at least make it free so people don't feel ripped off."
4,Get up and dance,"Douglas Lawler has a real talent. This CD make you want to get up and dance. I especially like #4 on here, ""Good little girls(make mighty wild women)"". Hope to hear more fom him in the future."
5,The Very Best I've Read In a Long Long Time,"Poignant, funny, charming, cynical and smart, with beautiful artwork, this is the best comic I've read in a long long time. It's really a shame this didn't catch on, but it's really worth reading."
3,Not quite what I expected,"First of all, the color in the pictures is a bit deceptive. Instead of a light pink color, I received one in hot pink. I was also expecting a cover similar to the one I had for my old phone where the pieces were more like a sleeve that you slide the phone into, with a plastic/vinyl covering for the inside screen and keypad. Instead, this only covers the outside bits, thus not protecting the inside of the phone from facial oils, make-up, sweaty fingers, etc. Overall, with a price so reasonable and the fact it does offer some protection though just for the outside of my phone, this cover is better than nothing."
4,Glitter with a Bit Darker Pink,"Picture of case is a bit off. The color is not a solid lite pink. I received this item today and it is a bit darker in pink tone with clear glitter on it. It snaps on the front and back. There are no plastic see through cover for front screen, camera opening, inside screen and keypad. For such a low price, I'll keep it. It still looks cute, but your screens and keypad won't be protected from oily or dirty prints. My case did have a little scar in front of the case, but not worth complaining about for the price. It would have been nice that the shipper did not send this to me and made sure it looked perfect before shipping it out. But I think the shipper did acknowledge the flaw and thus the low price. That's my two cents on this item."
3,Cute case,"This case is pretty cute. I read other reviews that said it gets dirty easily--that's true. It does look pretty sleek and offers some protection. I wish I had gotten one that protects the screens, though. But for the price it's a great deal--affords the ability to add a belt clip. The clip is sturdy and that was my main focus as I usually keep it safe in my purse and only need the case when I'm out walking, etc. and don't want to carry a purse."
1,not what you think,"I purchased this ""leather"" cover for my cell phone. When I received it I was so dissapointed. It was a plastic shell covered with very little leather. I should of known by the price. I spent more for shipping than for the leather cover. Do not buy this item."
1,pink motorazor case,Product is nice but found out way too expensive. Were is the leather? Looks nice but please don't buy this product.
5,Great cell phone cover,I ordered this cell phone cover and it is great. Fits the phone and really protects it.. I am very pleased..
4,Good use,"I have got this one for about 3 months now. It shows dirt pretty easily and I don't like pink, that's why it's a 4. Otherwise, it saved my phone the other day when I dropped it. The leather is nice for $5. My phone is a Motorola V3t and it fits just fine even though it was particularly for V3.One thing to care about when you put this case on is not to press it on the buttons on the side of your phone. It freezes the phone until you put it off."
3,From Back Cover,"Billionaire Matt Walker was not a man who walked away from what he wanted. And what he wanted was the hand of lady Helena Reichard. The darling of the paparazzi, Helena had recently been through hell and back - emerging a changed and vulnerable woman. The tall, green-eyed Texan was experiencing and intense desire to protect her, to be her avenging angel, to make her his forever. But would his love be able to pierce the darkness of her woulded spirit and prevail?"
5,My grandkids love it!,"The wooden mosaic by Haba provides hours of educational fun. Kids learn spatial relationships, and stimulate their creativity.It is very durable!"
4,Fun for the kids,"My grandkids got a Spiderman tent and I got the tunnels for them. I haven't seen them yet, but understand they are enjoying it"
2,It Worked....for a little while,"I checked here and read the reviews before purchasing. I'm the eternal optimist, thinking a few critics had just gotten a bad apple. Well, I got one too. This little maching worked great for about a month...then it completely died. To send it back they charge $15 plust postage (each way). Listen to to critics. Don't take a chance. Buy one of the big ones and just do it right from the start (like I didn't do)."
3,"Just too small to do much good, even in a small space.","For a bathroom or kitchen, as suggested by the manufacturer? Put the money toward a 30-pint or larger unit.Can't give it less than 3 stars because it does work - just not fast enough to do the job in any space larger than a closet. Which is why it turned out to be $50 wasted, for me."
2,"Would Have Earned 5 STARS, but only worked 4 months!","Bought my Wind Chaser, in spite of the negative reviews I'd read concerning bearing problems, thanks to others, who'd written in a simple way to remedy that problem. I absolutely LOVED this little guy, (he was perfect for my small living room), & looked forward every few days, to finding out how much unwanted moisture I'd captured. After only a few months of use, however, I noticed the machine was not running. I turned it off, then back on, & it ran fine for a few more days, then cut off again. This time, turning it off then back on, didn't help. I never heard bearings, or any noise that wud have indicated problems. I miss my little WC, but even tho now priced $10 less than I paid, wont ask for another faulty product."
4,Dr. Grazioli,It does the job for the price. I have 2 of these units in the same room and they work quite well.
1,Broke after a month.,I bough it for my walk in closet and was pretty excited as this Mini Dehumidifier did a good job at first. After a bout 3 weeks it started to make a humming noise and finally gave up. I don't particularly want to deal with Wind Chaser customer service after reading some reviews here but looks like I have to. Stay away from this product.
1,a towel works better,I bought this to help out our water damaged house. We have a lot of water and over night it only got out a little tiny bit of water. We are taking it back today.
1,Died in less than 6 months,"Really pulled the water. Had to constantly keep watch because reservoir would fill up in a few days and then shut off. Decided to make a modification so the reservoir would automatically drain. Worked great, but motor died in less than 6 months. Bought two. Both died about same time. Strange huh??I would go back to manufacturer, but they probably would say it was because of my auto drain modification. I doubt it. In fact, I think they should create a model that does drain through tube outlet so you don't have to constantly check it. We stored clothes in storage closet and went away for 8 months. Our house sitter checked regularly, and then it just stopped!"
2,Broke down after 4 months,I bought two of these the same day to use in different bathrooms. Worked fine for about four months then they both broke down within two weeks of each other. I'm not inclined to buy another.
4,Small and Quiet,"I wanted a small and quiet dehumidifier for our camper trailer that we are living in while building a house. Full size dehumidifiers are too loud (and too big) for such a small place and WindChaser is small. Not as quiet as I was led to believe, but it works. No more wet windows in our bedroom even in our cool NW weather. I'm thinking of buying one more for our living area. I would have given this 5 star except they should have listed the db's so I could have known what to expect with noise. It doesn't bother us sleeping but I can't hear the coyotes howl anymore at night. It's a little louder than our computer."
3,Simple construction,"For the techies out there... This dehumidifier is an overgrown peltier chip, two big heat sinks, and a fan for forced air. 13vdc @ 5A input. Nice form factor, effective. I might build this guy a big brother one day."
3,Once again...,"This unit works well in a small confined area, such as under a stariwell or a closet. The dehumidifyer ran for almost a year before I needed to re-oil the unit as has been previously mentioned. The fix is so easy, it should be included in the product manual. The reservoir is small and it is easy to forget about it when it is running. Another fix that has been mentioned is drilling a hole in the removable reservoir and gluing a line in so that it can drain into a larger container or even into a drain. I did this and now the dehumidifyer sits on a 5 gallon bucket. I figure by the time it fills the bucket I need to 'check the oil' anyway. The dehumidifyer is efficient enough that when it is damp it can fill in as little as two to three days."
1,Stopped working,Had the unit in my 35 ft boat for about a year. Worked pretty well until today. Now broken. Will prob move up to one of the large units. Wish there was something between this unit's capacity .8 and the home units 25.
5,Great for Small Travel Trailer,"We have used our Windchaser, mini dehumdifier now for around 9 months and NO problems. We keep it running 24/7 in our 25' travel trailer while its in storage and it makes a HUGE difference. You do have to remember to empty it about once a week here in Texas. I will probably modify the holding tank with an aquarium drain valve and let it drain into our gray water tank so we don't have to remember to dump it."
2,Noisy and adapter is almost the size of the unit,"I bought this to help with the humidity problem in the bathroom. I picked it because the description said that it was small and I have a small bathroom. The unit itself is small but the adapter is almost the size of the unit, so in reality the dehumidifier is twice as big as it is advertised. I think this is deceptive advertisement because this small detail about the adapter size is not stated anywhere. The adapter also gets very hot. The unit produces a lot of noise for such a small appliance. The unit did not work very well at removing water and I returned it. I bought calcium chloride pellets instead and they work great. They remove water, do not take much space, do not use electricity and do not break! It's a winning combination for me."
1,"Broke down after a few months, no customer service","The machine worked for about four months, then the power supply went out. It took 2-3 months to finally get the company to send a new power supply (for which I had to pay $5), and the machine STILL doesn't work. No one any longer answers their customer service line. They say to send an e-mail--to which there is never a reply--or to call back later. A total rip off. Buyer beware. Amazon should be ashamed for even selling this device."
2,Crummy Motor & Warranty,"This was a great deal on Amazon (still love you guys) because it is compact & worked great UNTIL the motor went after 6 months.. you have to pay to ship it back to manufacturer, pay to have it repaired, and pay to have it shipped back. Warranty not worth it.. too much out of pocket."
3,Glockshot and Vfern are my new heroes!,"I bought this item last spring, and it worked perfectly for about 4-5 months. Then it went kaput, as mentioned in several others' reviews. I was about to toss it and write a nasty review on this site, when I happened to read the suggestions of Glcokshot and Vfern. And the unit now works! Follow everything they say exactly, and you will be fine. As Vfern mentioned, it takes a few minutes once you close the unit to get it working again - for me, it took about 10 minutes.Many thanks!"
1,Worked well until it broke in 2 weeks,"I was really happy with this item when I got it. I lived in an apartment that had all kinds of moisture and mildew problems. The dehumidifier was pulling about a cup of water out everyday which I was really happy about. But alas, after only about 2 weeks it stopped working completely. Looks like other reviewers have had similar longevity problems with this item so I'd have to conclude that this is not a well made product."
1,P.O.S. Product,I used this dehumidifier for a few months and it just stopped working. I recommend you pay a little extra for a better quality product.
4,Bill Evans - Saxophonist,"This CD features Bill Evans, the saxophonist who played with Miles Davis & John McLaughlin in the 80's, not pianist BIll Evans."
5,Excellent Music. Excellent Interpretations.,"Tchaikovsky is often considered a heart-on-sleeve Romantic, and he is. These four suites surely show him for that, but also for something more: a consummate master of his craft. Both qualities of the composer come through in the wonderful performances captured in this recording. Dorati shapes compelling interpretations, and the Philharmonia offers its usual superb playing. The Phillips engineers' work holds up very well after all these years. Here is a bargain music lovers should not pass up."
5,Tchaikovsky Suites for Orchestra,"I bought this to replace an open reel tape performance in which the tape was showing it's age - starting to squeal on my old deck. Happily, this was the same performers as my pre-recorded tape so I knew what to look - and listen - for. Downloaded it then copied it to 2 cd's. Much prefer to listen on my home stereo system then on ear buds. Worked out very well - enjoyed the performance and the sound quality."
2,Not so hot,"Doesn't put out much warmth. I have to have it about 6 inches from my ankles. Never overheats me, but occasionally it overheats itself. The dial immediatly broke so that it can be accidentally turned beyond the last setting, in which case the heater doesn't turn on at all. I'm now looking for a replacement."
4,You get what you pay for - this is not so bad...,"Despite the reivews of others, I was looking for a cheap way to heat my office, and this has done the trick so far. Yes, this is a cheap - cheap prodcut; all palstic parts, could easily break if you don't pay attention. It does the job. It can heat my 12'x12' office from 57 degrees to 73 degrees in about 1/2 hour. This does not put out high heat - but it does put out good consistant heat. You are getting what you pay for here. For under $25.00 people should expect so much from a product like this. Stay warm!"
1,The machine NEVER turned on.,"The machine was advertised as new, but I obviously got used and not working. The fan never blew. The only thing that worked was the Caution light. I'm sending it back and hoping to get a guaranteed working product in return for my money."
2,Not so hot,"Doesn't put out much heat. I have to sit right on top of it. And my dial broke immediately, too. It pushes right beyond the highest setting, in which case I get no heat at all."
5,very lovely,i like it alot. i'm using for my lemon juice. i use fresh lemon juice only. very easy to use.
5,The reviews don't lie!,"This is the highest-rated olive oil cruet on Amazon for for good reason. It's an adorably cute size (fits in the palm of my hand!) and most importantly DOES NOT DRIP! Any excess oil slides back down the spout and then back into the bottle. No messy counter or oily jar.The glass is pretty delicate and I imagine that it would break fairly easily if it was knocked around or dropped. A few times, the spout has fallen out of the cruet when I'm pouring. Once the spout fell into a hot cast iron pan and I thought that it would shatter but it didn't crack - it's good as new!Other than those issues this is an excellent purchase."
5,just the right size,"I am very pleased with the cruet I just received. It will be ideal for limiting the amount of oil used. It certainly is big enough for us. 5 ounces is enough for 30 salads, using 1 teaspoon per salad."
5,"Chef's Planet 5 oz Glass Cruet - Small, looks nice, works well","I got this to promote use of olive oil (better for the heart) instead of butter (not good for the heart). When I make toast, I drizzle on it instead of butter. And to grease the frying pan, I drizzle. I've even drizzled on popcorn, and it works just fine. Drizzles when & where you want it, and doesn't drip. Good design.The 5 oz container is roughly the size of a baseball, and the spout is also glass (which wasn't obvious from the pictures, as I remember), but it came thru the mail w/no breakage and we haven't broken it yet, so I think I'm totally pleased with it."
3,Slippery,I was very excited to get this and it looked great in my kitchen. And then I started using it. I use olive oil at least 3 times a week and I felt like I was always refilling this. And every time I used it oil would leak downn the spout and onto the body which made it very slippery. I lost my grip picking it up one time and it fell onto the counter and broke. If you use oil a lot I would recommend getting a larger dispenser. And if you're afraid of dropping it I wouldn't recommend this one.
3,Product recently modified and now has an expanded orifice,"I have purchased eight ChefPlanet glass cruets over a few years. The product was superlative. When inverted, the cruet could be manipulated to selectively distill oil onto targeted food. Now, upon inversion, oil irrupts from the expanded orifice of the cruet. Presently, the cruet is but crudely manageable. The result can be excessive oil on parts of food. The former product was precise; the current one can be messy. A premium product has been vitiated."
3,good little cruet,This cruet was a gift for my mom. It had to sit on a narrow shelf over her stove. The cruet fits well and she is happy with it.
4,A cruet worthy of EVOO!,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HPXG4U/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis cruet is a quality product, and works as touted, with no drip or leakage. All glass, it even looks great on a marble counter-top. Of course, holding only 5 ounces, it's not intended for those occasions requiring large quantities of oil; however, it's perfect when a splash or a tablespoon or two is needed."
1,My baby didn't like it,"Well, my baby girl just doesn't seem to like this toy. I started putting her in it at 5 months (after she had very good head control) but it ususally ended in crying. It's a little difficult to get the baby's legs through the seat. Now at 8 months's she's still not too interested. She likes her jumperoo, but just really doesn't seem too interested in this exersaucer. I'd have to agree with another's review that the sounds are either too loud or too soft. This toy either gives you a big headache or else you can't hear the noises at all. For the money I'd have to say I am a little disappointed."
4,VERY entertaining...but hard to put together!,"My 5-month old loves this silly thing. We bought it to get her off her back, she HATES tummy time, but needed something to play with that didn't involve being on her back so much. (Her favorite thing is the Gymini play mat). We haven't had the problem with the purple flower like so many other reviewers. My only comment is that is was pretty challenging to put together, and you REALLY have to read the directions well. All in all, I'm very glad we spent the money. The colors are bright, the toys are all so different that our little girl doesn't get bored!"
3,You can do much better for less money,"I did not pick this saucer out, and I wish I had checked it out before opening it and putting it together. It LOOKS like it has so many toys... but 3 of them are just these butterfly things that hold the legs on and basically do nothing. The rest of the toys are good, and the music isn't annoying, so I will give it that. I would much rather have traded it in for something with more toys to play with, or something that will turn into a walker so my daughter could get more use out of it."
5,Nathaniel's Mom,"This is a great exersaucer. Although, it was on the expensive side, I feel it is worth the money. My son is 7 months and has been using it regularly since 4 months. Initally, I thought the arch with toys dangling would not be used, as he seemed disinterested. However, now he is very interested and loves to reach and pull. He has chewed on plenty of the toys and we have never had a problem with dye running. Very nice to have the colapsable feature. Works well for bringing in the car for grandma's house."
4,It is entertaining but my son grows out of it too quick,"I bought it ten days ago, when my 5 month old son has to be put on the second level. ( it says baby can not be stay inside with flat-footed). And now it has to raised to the third level because my son has already been flat-footed in it. It only has three levels. So probably I have to abondon it after using it for a month.Except for that, it is a great product. Its color, music and overall design are fasinating. My son seems having fun in it."
5,My 4 month old LOVES it!,"After reading the complementing reviews online but, never seeing it in the store, I asked for it for my son for Christmas. I wasn't sure if he was going to be able to enjoy it right away since the box says 4-12 months and you never know if they are exaggerating. Well they weren't and my son loves it. He likes to spin around in the chair, chew on whatever he can, and lean on the book that makes noise and talks. He is able to entertain himself for 10-15 minutes while I am able to get things done, knowing he is in a safe place. This is one of the more expensive models but it is worth it and a must buy!"
4,Great for restless baby!!,This is a wonderful product if you have a baby who likes to keep busy and you can't keep up! Our 4 month old girl LOVES it. She didn't like the swing or any other product that didn't keep her upright. The only reason I took a star away is because it is difficult and time consuming to assemble but other than that I highly recommend it!
1,VERY DANGEROUS,"I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old as soon as he learned to move around in it this thing became a hazard. The springs that hold it together are held in a clear see through dome and the kids see it as a toy. once they start messing with it the dome easily twist off, the springs pop up and the excersaucer COLLAPSES WITH YOUR BABY INSIDE !!!!! It only takes a second and the saucer collapses on your babies legs very poorly made"
2,Box open and damaged,"I ordered the SmartSteps Exersaucer as a Baby shower gift, and the box was delivered in a damaged condition. The top was almost completely open, and I have no confidence that all the pieces and parts are actually there."
5,I Love this product,"My 6 month old got this when she was 4 months old. I took her to Babies R Us and see if she fits in it. What do you know, she started playing with all the toys and was on it for at least 45 minutes. I showed it to my husband how she enjoyed this toy and he had to get it for her. She still enjoys it. I called Evenflo to replace one toy since she overused it so much that it stop working. Now she's always entertained while we have a nice peaceful dinner. It keeps your little one busy and gets rid of all the excess energy so she gets a great nap or sleep."
5,SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,"I purchased this as a gift for my newest Godson. His mother and maternal grandmother have both told me on many occasions when he is fussy, the only thing that will calm him down is putting him in the Exersaucer. He loves it."
3,"Just Okay, We're not really blown away by it or anything!","This toy is just okay. I may feel differently when my baby gets a little bit older, but right now, she doesn't stay in it for longer than 10 minutes or so. She's 4 months old right now. She can't really sit upright so she ends up leaning forward a little bit.Update (3/13/06) She really likes it now--she will stay in it long enough for me to give the kitchen floor a good wash. She has tried all the toys, and is still learning how to play with some of them. But she seems to have a lot of fun trying! This product definitely deserves 4 stars!"
1,For One Hundred Dollars it should be half way assembled!,"I just purchased this item from Babies R Us today. I asked the salesperson if it was difficult to assemble, he said not really...well he lied through his teeth!I have bought and assembled more baby products than the normal consumer and this one is a definate challenge!! After working on it for over an hour I've decided to return it and get another model. I don't think it's worth the effort.The seat on the saucer has very little padding and it doesn't look at all comfortable for a little child. Very dissappointed in this product, the picture on the box looked fabulous!"
1,Color comes off from teething toy,"Purchased this Exersaucer for 4 days, it was really entertaining for my 6 monthes old son and he loves it. But we found all his clothes that he wore spending time in the saucer has some pink stains around the same area. I have a baby that puts everything in his mouth. By testing the toys on the excersaucer with a wet paper towel, we found out there was this flower with purple and blue petals that makes my paper towel all pink with its purple petal. I will contact evenflo tomorrow since it might be a health hazard for the baby."
3,Some problems with this toy,"I got this for my son when he was 5 months old. I choose this one because it had so many toys for him to play with. The first day I had to take the cell phone toy off because they made the antena so pointy that when he jumps around it was going right next to his eye. The second thing was the plastic that the butterfly sits on strips as the baby jumps up and down which is made for that since it is on springs. Anyway it striped so bad that it gets stuck and my baby's chest crashes down on the toy hurting him. We tried to smooth it down, but it keeps happening. I have also noticed the fowl smell from the flower toy like some others that wrote a review, however mine did not have the dye problem yet. Like the toy, but can be very dangerous."
5,Very Entertaining,"Our 3 month old daughter loves her Exersaucer. From the first time we put her in it, she was hooked! Although it was a little complicated to put together it was definately worth the aggrivation. My daughter loves to press the buttons on the learning pod and she always laughs and smiles. There is just so much to do that it keeps her entertained for quite a while. I would definately recommend this product to any parent."
4,Wonderful except for learning book....,"We were thrilled when this new exersaucer came out because of all the extras. The lights and music on multiple toys fascinates our 5 month old. However, we also had to return the removable book 2 times. Once it only worked on loud and only played the musical noise when you turn the page. The second one just made a terrible loud noise and didn't work at all!! If you can get one with a good book, it is definetly worth the money."
1,great toy but poorly made?,"I love the toys on this saucer. My son loves them, he couldn't stop staring at it in the store. I rated it one because I bought it with one of the toys on the bar broken and sent three emails to them never getting a response. Two months later the piece with the story books on it broke.It keeps making weird noises. Again I tried to contact them but didn't get a response. I am upset that we wasted our money. I don't know if we just happened to buy the one lemon or if they are not made very well."
3,"So, so.... It's not what we expected.",We bought this after we saw my nephew really enjoy his older model. Our daughter has been using this for the past three months since she was six months old. In the early days she was not too interested in the toys. I think she would have liked the older model with the animal figures instead of the toys that come with this delux model. The butterflys on the corners are suppose to twist as she pushes up and down and they don't work properly. I don't think it's worth the premium they are charging for it.
3,"Good toy, some problems","This is a wonderful toy. It keeps my four month old entertained for a long time. I found it very difficult to get the legs through the slots on the bottom. It took me a long frustrating time to finish assembaly. My other problem is that there is avery sharp point on the top of the play phone. The baby can easily scratch himself or poke his eye on this. I decided to remove this toy. Also, I liked the older model my daughter had better. I wish I had kept it. The toys were better and it was better quality. This newer one seems a bit cheaper although it is much more expensive."
2,EvenFlo Exersaucer,"From the moment we opend the box, this was a HUGE disappointment. The directions were HORRIBLE (really, not everything can be ""part A""), there were missing toys, and the activity bar never played music, or lit up, despite several battery changes. Yes, we could've returned it, but once you've opened it up, spent an hour putting it together...who has that kind of time with a 5 month old??? This is the 1st, and clearly last evenflo product we will buy. She likes it enough, but would probably love it if all the pieces were there, and it worked properly. Obviously, their QA department is lacking, much to our great disappontment"
2,Worried about safety of this toy...,"I won't dispute that this toy keeps baby entertained, but I have reservations about its safety as some other reviewers have remarked. I've noticed some of the same things.1. The dye from the teether runs off and looks faded now.2. The stickers scratch off easily when wet - not a good mix for an infant who puts everything in their mouth.3. The butterfly springy toys have plastic strings peeling off their stick - I can't imagine this would be safe for baby to ingest.4. THe telephone holster can create a dangerous ""impaling"" situation if baby hits his head or eye on it while playing.I have removed the dangerous toys and will be putting Tape over the butterfly springs since they cannot be removed. It's a shame since most of the other toys on this saucer are very engaging.I would search for something safer, maybe Evenflo's newer model of exersaucers have been improved."
5,You Can take a break with this Entertainer,"I have two girls (18 months and 7 months). Both have loved this stationary entertainer. Its full of toys for them to explore, it's completely safe for you to leave the room (to go potty or change the loads of laundry), it's easy to clean, and it's portable. We have taken it to grandma's and outdoor picnics. We just love it."
1,Disappointed before we even put it together...,"After reading all the comments regarding the running dye on the flower toy, we decided that we would test the fabric on all the toys before putting it together. We wet a paper towel and gently rubbed each toy. The dye ran on all the fabric, including the fabric on the seat and overhead bar. We decided to return the toy before putting it together. Who knows what danger the dye would be to an infant.We believe this item should be recalled by Evenflow."
3,The color bleeds on the flower rattle...,"Not sure what kinds of dye are in the fabric, but I imagine they aren't meant to be consumed. My daughter likes to chew on anything she can get to her mouth, and the flower bleeds dye when wet. I plan on cutting it off, which is a shame because it is the only thing on the exersaucer that she can get into her mouth. I would probably have purchased a different entertainer had I known it would bleed as it does."
5,A GREAT BUY!,"My husband and I took a great deal of time with purchasing our exersaucer. We shopped around for weeks. Eliminating others one by one. Finally we decided on this one. One, it has lots of features. You can remove the little book feature and have it go to the floor, high chair, wherever you want. The toys can be removed, once your little angel is bored with some of the toys you can inter change them with others ... and if you have an evenflo stroller the toys can go from the exersaucer to the tray of your stroller. It plays lots of sound effects and songs. The main thing is that it teaches your angel letters, numbers, shapes and colors. So this exersaucer is fun and educational. A definite great purchase. Thank you Evenflo!"
3,Watch out for funny stains!,"My son has been playing with this for about a month and loves it. The only thing he is not interested in is the toy bar, I wish I would have saved $20-$30 dollars and got one a little cheaper with out the toy bar! I have however had a huge problem with 50% of my sons cloths becoming stained with pink spots. I have been driving myself insain trying to figure out what was making this since it was appearing on only half his cloths. I read anothe review stating the flower toy had caused this same mystery stain with her son. Sure enough when I took a wet paper towel to the toy it turned up pink. I really like this toy, and I am going to try and cut off the flower, but you may want to try another model!"
3,"Good, except for the battery operated attachment.","My baby loves this item, however, we have had to replace the battery operated attachement two times now. A major pain esp. since the toy is so expensive. The company said there was a ""bad batch"". Also, I agree with the others on the die issue. I too had to cut off the toy."
1,Shoddy workmanship and abysmal customer service,"I received the Lotus system as a gift and was anxious to try it out. It lasted about six months before it stopped working entirely. The process of getting it repaired was extremely cumbersome. The company does not respond to emails to their customer service site and they do not answer their customer service number. You simply stay on hold for 10-15 minutes, then you are transferred to a voice mail which may or may not be returned.I finally was successful in getting the product repaired, and then I ordered replacement cartridges directly from Lotus Tersano. They sent me cartridges that had already expired, and then I had to start the process of dealing with their non-responsive customer service department all over again.Unless you have hours to spend trying to get this product to work and dealing with a nonresponsive company, don't even think about buying it."
5,Couldn't live without it,"Some folks have complained about getting an F1 error frequently. I have found that I get an F1 error when I sanitize grapes. Actually, I place the grapes into the bowl and swish them in water first and it's pretty horrifying how dirty the first rinse water is. (It's hard to tell that they're spraying grapes with down there in Chile...) Even after washing the grapes, I sometimes get an F1 error. My feeling is that the grapes were still too dirty for the unit to clean and I'm glad to know that the unit is ""smart"" enough to alert me.I love this little machine so much that I got one for my mom. She loves hers, too."
2,"Love this device, but who knew strawberries take repeated washings.","I love this machine, but strawberries must be really contaminated because you can only wash a handful at a time. Works great, and really does EXTENDS THE LIFE of the fruit or vegetable storage time.---- Edited Review after 2 years -----Broke in a year and it only breaks down after the warrantee is over. I began to leak from the bottom. It appears this a common occurrence and it is how they guarantee repeat business. The company is unless and will only sell you another unit.I will not buy from this company again!!! Workmanship Awful !!!! Customer Service is Horrific !!!"
1,Tersano Lotus Sanitizing System,I was very dissapointed with this product. It only worked twice and then it started malfunctioning (the F1 kept flashing). After various attempts I exchanged it for another one and the same thing happened. This time I did not hesitate to return it immediately and get a refund. The Amazon customer service was excellent on both occasions.
1,Good Idea...if it worked : (,I ordered this product in hopes that it would work. I am an avid gardener and enjoy eating vegetables from my garden. This product could give me peace of mind knowing what I consume is free from bacteria. I was never able to complete a cycle of cleaning because an error occured each time. I called customer support and they wanted me to run it on bottled water and give a call back. Why should I use bottled water? Call me when the real deal is available.
1,"Good concept, but fail within 24hrs","I didn't know it is sold by Sharper image until couple hours earlier when i was trying to search the web for my F1 issues. I will try to contact the customer support tomorrow to see if there is any solution, but if I'm reading all the ""real"" review carefully, this is a very troubled product. Man I threw away the boxes already, and I'm not sure how Tersano handles RMA... I will report back and let you know their customer service. Btw i bought the unit directly from the website which is cheaper at the moment... I hoped i didn't get one of those returned unit..."
2,Fabulous but rarely works,"I'm on my second one and it still does not get past 97% - It has to reach 100% to clean your vegatables. Even plain water gets the error message F1 before finishing. it's obvious this product should not have been launched yet. It did go all the way through the cycle one time ( out of 30 other trys), the vegtables were wonderful that actually made it through and were better tasting and stayed fresh longer."
3,How much Ozone does this product spew into the indoor air in the house?,"Ozone is a good disinfectant, but also is harmful to humans when it is inhaled. It can be a source of indoor air pollution and cause breathing problems. Do we know how much ozone this product releases in the air during its functioning? Can the ozone ""bubble"" out of the water and into the air to any extent? How much ozone is liberated per hour (or min) of use? Would be great to know the answer to these questions before buying! Would give it 5 stars if these concerns can be addressed, and if the mechanical issues cited by other reviewers can be fixed."
1,F1 error message after 3 times,"We bought this item 2 years ago and intended to use it for wash fruit and vegetable. It started to have F1 error after we used it for 3 times. We had done everything according to the user guidance. It functioned again for a couple of time then showes F1 error again. After that, it did never get through 100% of cleaning process. We have to dispose it."
2,Leaks after just 2 years,We bought our lotus sanitizing system about 2 years ago and used it once per week during this time. It now leaks out the bottom and is not usable. It was never dropped or mishandled. The company will repair it for $50 plus shipping charges. A well made product should not need to be repaired in this short of a period.
1,POS,"Talk about a lot of BS...this product does nothing they say it does. You are lead to believe you get this super powerful cleaning solution, you get water. Talk about snake oil! All that happens is the water swirles around and you get some bubbles. And when you spray this so called "" super powerful"" water on any stain, or grease, or anything else, it acts....well like water. Also the spray bottle is a piece of junk, it really does not ""spray"" the water out, it dribbles it out. I have never been so disappointed in a product....I had to write this review to tell people to save their money."
3,doesn't work half the time,"don't be surprised when this item doesn't work every other time you use it, and you have to restart the process and wait for the system to treat the water all over again."
2,"Deliver as promised, however, there are some defect issues.","The product worked as promised, however, my first ""2"" units kept showing ""F3"" error messages.When I returned to SharperImage, their sale rep. told me that the company ""Tersano"" has realized the problem and when customers return, just replace them with new one.I got my ""THIRD"" one 2 days ago, which arrived to store on July 7th. They did fixed the ""F3"" problem, but now, July 9th, it starts showing ""F1"" error messages.The reason I gave 2 star instead of 1 is because it's a good concept and when it worked, it did what they advertised. Unfortunately, there are still bugs that they need to fix. I will return my ""THIRD"" one, and get my refund. I guess ""Third time's a charm"" does not work on this product."
1,Seems like there are a lot of fake reviews on the 28th,"Considering that the units reportedly don't work (see 7/26 review from manufacture), it seems odd that there are three reviews on 7/28 all giving it 5 stars. Especially since manufacturer on 7/26 said that Sharper Image was instructed to return all units. Really brings the average review up. I noticed that all reviewers giving it 5 stars have never reviewed any other product."
1,Need to work the bugs out,"The idea of this product is great. And it does a fine job of sanitizing plain water. However I could never get it to finish a cycle when trying to sanitize foods. And the claims of cleaning are a bit of a hype. Sanitizing is about all the water can do. It did not clean mildew, soap scum or even plain old dirt off of anything. And if it takes so many trys to get the product to work how is this helping in reducing costs associated with wasting electricity. I sent mine back. They should have worked a little harder on getting the bugs out before introducting this to the public."
1,Buyer's Remorse,"I've purchased two of these units and I am extremely disappointed. Both of them malfunctioned, both stopped working. I attempted to contact customer service to see if they would send me a replacement since I have purchased two of their units and they told me there was nothing that they could do. I'm done. Nice concept, poor execution."
1,Poorly Made...Finally Giving Up,"I have been using the Lotus cleaning system for at least six years. I love the idea of using it to clean fruit, vegetables and household surfaces.Why is the machine built so poorly?? There is no reason for me to go through multiple machines. I have replaced the machine at least four times. I have even purchased new ones when the machine was out of warrenty. I have had two leak from the bottom and my current replacement model is flashing F7.Their customer service is terrible. You can't get through and you go into a black hole voice mail.In all of the time that I've owned a unit, I have never recommended it. I'm not sure why I have been so loyal. I am finally done...I can certainly use the counter space for something else."
1,Company does not stand behind the product,"I was really excited about this product. Then I tried using it. The water bottle attachment works fine but the bowl attachment will not pass a cycle even with just plain water. I called the manufacturing company. They told me to buy Dasani brand water and run the bowl two times with the Dasani water. That cost me $5 to do. I did that and it didn't work. I still got the error message with just plain Dasani water. I called the company back and they said if the water bottle attachment works then the unit works and they won't do anything. I told them I bought this item for my produce not for the spray bottle. They then told me just use the water bottle on all the produce.This was a brand new item and they won't take it back, and they won't replace it. I spent over $200 on something that doesn't do what it says and the company will not stand behind there product.Just be warned you may be stuck with something that doesn't work."
4,Usefull addition,Works well on my vegetables and fruits; extends freshness and prevents spoiling. I use it often...glad to have it.
4,tersano lotus,"The product works well. It is critical that one used the right level of water, too little doesn't fly. Also, as indicated in some of the other reviews, strawberries (berries in general) and grapes often need more than one cycle. This doesn't seem to be a product issue but an issue with pesticides and the surface volume of the fruit. Organic grapes did not have the issue."
2,Tersano lotus LBU100 Sanitizing System,"I purchased this product based on the high recommendations made by a radio personality in our area. Conceptually the product made lot of sense. I was, however, very disappointed when I started using the product. I called the Customer Service number and they were not helpful at all.Here is the problem I have been encountering. I cannot get the system to clean anything 100%. I get ""Code F1"" after the display shows that it has cleaned 97%. The Customer Service rep told me to keep trying it 6 or 7 times. Well that takes lot of time and patience. I have tried to clean grapes 4 or 5 times and still got F1 code. Now I clean 2 times and hope that the fruits are ""pretty clean"".I am not sure if I have received a ""bad product"" or most of the users are encountering similar problems. In any case I am not as excited about using the product frequently. I think either the manufacturer should fix their product or be upfront and state clearly about the F1 issue."
4,The U.S. Tour,"A fine addition to the library of any serious student of U.S. Grant. But readers interested in what world travel was like in the late 1870s or those interested in the specific history and culture of countries such as Eygpt, Viet Nam, China, and Japan will also find this volume of interest.This is not a biography of General Grant but a trip back into the time machine to a different era. I do quarrel with the editor, Professor Fellman, when he declares General Grant ""...the oddest member of the American pantheon."" The book itself disproves this ""odd"" assessment."
5,LOVE THIS,"I borrowed a friend's Pampered Chef flower bread mold to make little sandwiches for my daughter's birthday party and then saw this set and ordered them too. I used my friend's and this one so I could made 2 loaves at once to save time and couldn't tell a bit of difference between them. I used Pilsbury French Bread Dough from the can, so easy. The sandwiches turned out sooo cute and everyone loved them. Great deal to get all three for such a great price! Can't wait to use the star one for the 4th of July!!"
4,Adorable,The product arrived promptly to my sister's home. When using them to make sandwich bread be prepared to try a few attempts. It took my sister and I three attempts to make them correctly.
1,not great,"the tin is very flimsy, I poured batter in and it leaked out of the base, its also a lot larger than I thought it would be"
1,Awful,"Tried it several times, followed the recipe and it turned out all mushy, yuk yuk. I would send it back but would cost to much to ship it, and I wonder if the makers figured on that. A piece of garbage."
1,Not what I thought it would be,I thought that this would be a mold for cutting bread and making little snacks and treats and you have to bake the bread in the mold. I have never baked bread in my life and wasn't really planning on it. It may be my fault that I missed the details before purchase but felt misled by description and now have a product I will not use.
2,Tilts and falls,"I find two flaws with this product. First, when tilted even slightly, it falls. Secondly, it does not tilt forward only backward."
4,Does what I need it to do...,"The product arrived quickly and in perfect working order (note that I live in Hawaii). I use it to supplement my air conditioner which doesn't circulate the entire room well. This fan is a bit noisier than I expected. However, I still use it on low speed at night (despite being a light sleeper). I don't particularly care for the intermittent ""wind"" settings since that significantly increases the noise level of operation. The remote control is an excellent feature since I have the unit placed on top of a bookshelf where I can't reach or see the on-unit controls. Love the relatively compact size (didn't want a stand type fan but these box fans are sorta hard to find). Thanks, Amazon, for offering a good product!"
2,windchaser remote control fan,"I was disappointed with a couple of things.First the size of the fan was way smaller than I had anticipated. Second the fan tips over when it is set on high as the force of the ""wind"" pushes it over. Later I found a tower fan with remote on sale for the same price and it performs a lot better."
3,"""Underground"" Review","This collection of ten tracks recorded by San Diego rap star Jayo Felony in his early days is surprisingly impressive. If you're expecting a mainstream guest-filled full length album, you'll be in for some dissapointment but if you can't get enough of Bullet Loco, you'll want to check this one out. The production courtesy of DJ Silk is simple but effective, it's Jayo's flow that really makes ""Underground"" worth its weight. His energy on tracks like ""My Name In Your Mouth"" and ""Flow 4 Ya"" is very impressive and it shows that a true emcee can make a hot track without a million-dollar production team behind him. This isn't to say that Silk isn't doing good work on the beats but there are dozens of rappers (many with major label deals) that probably wouldn't know how to rock them like Jayo."
5,Great tennis panties,I think Adidas is by far the best for this style of tennis pantie. Fits well and very comfortable.
4,Pretty good - worth the money,"It shows some rare footage you wouldn't find else where, for instance, him at basketball games and such. It's better than most of the other videos, so I recommend it,"
4,"fun, but not as disgusting as it could be...","My best friend and I share a passion for simpsons interactive figurines, so we were both quite pleased when we saw that Wendell was on the market. Sadly, he was something of a disapointment. Though colectively we own the courthouse environment, main street, the springfield elementary cafiteria, the bowling alley, the retirement castle, the police station, the DMV, and one other that I am clearly not going to remember right now, the only environment in which we could coerce Wendell into speaking was main street. Even then all he had to say for himself was ""You better belive it."" He did, however, come with his own barf-bag, and in that I suppose the toy has redeemed itself for its disapointing showing."
2,tight group old school representer,"but this cd was ok not like i thought,so i will try the next PE dvd it have to be better cause there the truth from oh10"
4,Compact and works as advertised. May not work with all cases.,"One word of caution. The connector on the iPod side is large so it may not be able to work with all cases, it did not with mine. Been using it for about a month now and that is my only complaint."
3,Good for older ipods,I have had this product for a few years and originally bought it for my 5th generation ipod it worked well for it. I have since upgraded to an itouch and an ipad and found that unfortunately this does not work for them.
5,"GREAT BOOK, GREAT STORIES","THE AUTHOR HAS RESEARCHED THESE TALES OUT PERSONALLY, I MYSELF AM A GHOST HUNTER AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO VALIDATE A ""GHOST STORY"", OTHERWISE THERE IS NO WAY TO BACK UP THE ORIGINAL TELLERS STORY. VERY WELL RESEARCHED. ONCE YOU PICK IT UP IT'S HARD TO PUT DOWN. I ACTUALLY READ THIS IN RECORD TIME, AND PASSED IT ON TO A FELLOW GHOST HUNTER WHO FEELS THE SAME WAY I DO ABOUT IT. FABULOUS."
2,More a documental than a Music video,"Good sound and the multilingual subtitles are a plus, but is more a documental about Milton Nascimento than a music video, most of the songs are incomplete..."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this book on King's reputation and was very disappointed. The first third of the book covers very basic subjects that every sewer knows, I don't need information on irons, marking tools or fabrics. The book is basically about cording. I sort of like the way he used it on one outfit which is all that's shown in the book. There are a couple small pictures of some beading that I would like to be able to see or have any comment on putting together. The one brief bit about edging sheer fabric is okay but one technique I've seen many times."
3,Book for beginners,"There are not many books out there for this style and I was hoping to get a more well rounded view of CLF by reading about it. However, what the author covers are basic techniques. It seems the author is well versed in several martial arts, however the book did not seem to be written by an expert CLF practitioner.A good photo outline of one version of the two beginning sets fundamental to choy lay fut.This book is only for people just starting choy lay fut or those who want to read about it before trying it."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed by the tone of this book. It made it seem like very few women are capeable of continuing to breastfeed after returning to work, when in fact the opposite is true. It also discounted well known organizations (including the American Academy of Pediatrics) recommendations about the importance of breastfeeding exclusively for 6 months and continuing to breastfeed with complementary solids for at least a year. I am not a militant breastfeeding fanatic - just a mom, and I was able to continue breastfeeding with very few modifications. This book needs work...."
1,There's better advice than this out there!,"Wilkoff labels breastfeeding after returning to work as being overly troublesome for new moms. Not so. As a breastfeeding mother, I have successfully breastfed while working full time with minimal hassle or interruptions to my life. I recommend any woman looking for good breastfeeding information and support buy Dr. Sears The Breastfeeding Book or The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. Breast is best - and for a lot longer than just the first three months!"
2,Very negative book,"I am quite liberal about doing what is right for you and your baby and not being guilted into breastfeeding. But at the same time, this book is SO negative.The author (a man) kept referring to breastfeeding and pumping as a hassle. I've never felt like it is a hassle.He constantly talked about breadtfeeding in public as offensive. huh?This guy is on the other side of the spectrum.If you truly want to breastfeed, this is not the book for you. It is not encouraging at all. Thankfully I was already committed to breastfeeding before I read it. Otherwise I think the book would have discouraged me.I am succesfully continueing to nurse after I've gone back to work. And it's not a hassle, but a wonderful way to stay connected to my baby. I'm currently reading the Milk Memos and it's the better choice. I'm loving it so far."
5,Very Helpful!,"This book is incredibly usable and full of common sense information and advice on breastfeeding in general, as well as infant care and ways to make the experience successful! I read this book, intending to wean once I went back to work and instead nursed for 1 yr!"
2,new knife and compass ?,"the knife we received is what we expected, but the compass does not seem to exist. even after calling we still only have 1/2 of this set"
3,Important info about the volume number listed.,"If your a Babylon 5 fan, you know that season 5 didn't really live up to its promise - it just tied up a lot of loose ends in the plot! You also know that you will want to buy this video, just like you're buying all of the rest. Ah well, at least we B5 fans aren't sitting around with plastic ""Spock"" ears on, yet! (Although, I wonder how many are draping blankets over their shoulders and pretending to be Marcus? A little role playing never hurt anyone!) This is a typical episode from the 5th season, but be aware, Amazon's listing is incorrect! This is actually vol. 3 from the fifth season (""In the Beginning"" is vol. 1 & ""No Compromises""/""The Very Long Night ..."" is vol. 2). Other than that, you already know what you're getting if you are looking at B5 titles so, enjoy!"
2,Doesn't drain and gets rusty,"Got this dish rack because it's stainless steel but it still rusts! Because it doesn't drain (not sure why I wasn't more observant), the legs that sit on the tray gets rusty! The utensil holder falls off the rod from time to time and it's a bit annoying. I've abandoned this dish rack and got myself a SimpleHuman dish rack instead!"
1,Disappointed dishwasher,"I bought this exact same dish rack from another company ... . I liked this dish rack for the stainless quality and for looks. I was very disappointed that it has no sides, therefore cups and bowls, etc fall out continually. Nor does it hold many dishes at one time. The drained water stands in the bottom tray and has to be emptied with each use. The stainless steel will indeed last forever, but not in my house."
2,"too small, rusts","I actively dislike this dishrack. As noted, plates and bowls slide out because of open sides, it's too small for anything but VERY casual use (don't buy it if you do all your dishes by hand), and contrary to the PR, it does indeed rust. Water catches in the bottom and has nowhere to drain, so you end up with an unsanitary pool of water under your dishes. Not recommended."
1,How nasty could it be?,"Like another reviewer said, the water just stands in the bottom and there is no way for it to drain. I paid, what I consider to be a lot of money for a dish rack and it stinks....literally. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,"Nice, small sized dish rack, but stainless steel rusts","This is a nice looking dishrack, and is the perfect size for me - I live by myself and always wash my dishes by hand. The only problem is that within the first week the tray started rusting, and now the rack itself is beginning to rust. As well as washing my dishes, I have to wash the rack too! I've used this rack for a little less than half a year, and am looking to replace it now."
1,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a large, nice, stainless steel drain rack and was not happy once I actually used this. First, there's no way to drain the water from the tray below into the sink, you have to lift and dump it out. :-(. Second, it just doesn't have the space I like, like on the plastic ones, for glasses...and the like and things slip-or don't stay where I put them. Thirdly, the silverware tray is strange, that the silverware leans way over to one side, making it more difficult to put more in as you wash. I would return it had I kept the receipt. Who would have thought you had to use a drain rack to know if you like it?!"
1,Deeply disappointed,"I purchased this product a few years ago and it rusts despite the claim that it is rust resistant. Secondly, the drainage rack has nowhere to drain so the water accumulates and creates more rust. I will now purchase a cheap plastic dish rack that can be cleaned easily."
2,quality has degraded and now rust,"I owned this dish rack 7 years ago and it never rust. It's still at my mom's house and looks beautiful. When I moved out, I bought the same dish rack and within 6 months, rust everywhere! There are rust water staining my granite countertop which is not good. The bottom pan also has water stains that I can't get remove no matter how hard I scrub."
2,It Rusts,"I figured out how to stack more dishes by angling the glasses, and I love the drainer, BUT it rusts! Stainless steel, my foot!"
1,Disappointed,I should have read the reviews before I bought this dish drain. The water doesn't drain out so we turned it over and punch holes in the rim. This does help the water to drain but along the lip we now have mold growing. The utensil caddy is the worse..everything falls...there is no place to put your glasses and the compartment for the dishes is also lacking. Dishes fall right through the large opening.Rust? It does rust. I bought stainless steel because I thought that wouldn't happen...Surprise !!!So needless to say I am disappointed. Do not buy this product!
1,Looks nice at first but very unfunctional.,"It looks nice. But when you have a lot of dishes to do, you can't stack because of the uneven surface on one side. The lower part is so low, that sometimes the dishes wind up sitting in dirty water.I would NOT recommend this product."
4,Fine Dish Rack,"A stainless steel wire frame dish drainer. It is strong, and holds up dishes. It has a flat surface for larger items. It met my needs. Note: Water will gather in the tray - need to empty the tray and wipe with dry towel. Otherwise, the water will evaporate and leave stains. Overall, I am happy with it."
3,dish drainer,"I really like this dish drainer, because it's stainless steel and has alot of space. The only negative is there is no way for the water to drain into the sink from the drainer. It has to be lifted up to allow water to get over the edge. A couple of holes drilled in the bottom tray would help. It's better than the plastic coated metal. I have found that those type eventually rust thru. This dish drainer looks very nice, classy even."
4,bought for my grandmother,"I bought this for my Granny for Christmas. And she absolutely loves it, it doesnt rust and it shines beautifully on her counter top."
2,Great for toddlers when they are asleep,"the jogger is great, big tires, colapses small, but its boring for the baby."
2,Bummer,"I bought this jogger and loved it at first. It has turned into a dud. It pulls to the left, the frame is creaking under the strain of having to correct it from pulling. I don't use it for jogging- just trips around the block with my 8 month old and to a local park where there's gravel. Tried to fix it but we can't get it right. Hope you have better luck. Still waiting on Baby Trend to return my call.**Update... Baby Trend never called me back but I did finally get them. The customer service rep said I could send it back but if their mechanic fixed it the problem and then dis-assembled it and sent it back I may still have a problem because I am not a mechanic and the problem might just be me. Not friendly service. I never sent it back and use it very little."
4,"It's great for rough terrain, with one small drawback...","We have a family cottage on Lake Michigan, and for the rough terrain, it's PERFECT... it's quite heavy, so it's not our trunk stroller; it lives at the cottage with Grandma and Grandpa and is their stroller for when we're there on weekends, spring, summer and fall. My only complaint is that it pulls to the left immediately upon assembly. There are directions re: taking care of the pull, but they are a bit confusing. I trust that if we really put our minds to it, my husband and I could work it out, but even with a little built in lean, this stroller makes walks on the gravel roads and in the woods a dream. Under these circumstances, I think its ideal, and at $100 its a great value."
4,"A bit heavy, but good!","Since my husband and I travel to out of the way locations a great deal we decided to invest in this stroller. I have to say it's a bit heavy for running, but for everyday use it's good. The heavy duty tires really do make a huge difference in the ride"
3,"A good, affordable stroller","I have enjoyed my stroller. It has served me well, however, I am a suburban ""walker"". I should note that my hand brake has never worked but my husband says that it should be an easy fix. I was also frustrated when the storage area on the back of the seat broke within the first 6 months - the string snapped. It had not had a lot of use & now the stroller looks dishevelled.My 18 month old enjoys riding in the stroller & even climbs in & asks to go out in it. He likes the ""hidden"" pockets on the inside so that he can put his snack & other little surprises for along the way. I would buy this stroller again."
5,JESSYE DOES JUSTICE TO GERMAN,"I like the sound of German sung from Jessye Norman's lips. There is dignity and tragedy, sorrow in song. But listening to it now it is wunderkind. She projects powerfully and playfully. We should hear more of her on PBS."
4,Wonderful insight into the traditions that make up our holiday.,"Jock Elliott captures and relates all of the building blocks that went into making our Christmas holiday what it is--in terms of the way in which we celebrate.As an ad man, he's got a unique perspective.Fascinating reading."
5,cannon fodder,I like this booster pack because it has mostly low level pieces. Many of the other packs have supper powerful guys and no low point guys to supliment your army. This pack has plenty of cannon fodder for the war machine to throw lots of bad guys at your opponent. Pieces have point values as low as 5 and most are between 11 to 25 points.
3,Excellent Video,"The video is very useful for my classroom, but it arrived broken and luckily it was able to be repaired, but I do not know how long it will last!"
3,Will NOT RUN on a 64 Bit Windows OS,Do not buy this if you are running a newer 64 bit version of Windows (Vista or 7). It will not work.
3,I like Pajama Sam,"It was a bit scary when you get into Darkness'room. The two door guards were nice and it was a very nice game my mother and I played. - child age 6My son wanted to review this to let his voice be heard. We love all the Pajama Sam games, but this one was a bit scary for 3-5 year olds."
3,"Great having all functions, but reliability is just ok","This unit takes a lot of water out of the air in my basement, and shuts off when the tank is full. You can also hook it up to drain out a hole which accomodates a hose of some sort.I am having a problem with it after only running it for a few months. The dehumidifier keeps shutting off, thinking the tank is full and it surely isn't. I played with the switch and gave the unit a bang and it started working again. Not confidence inspiring. For an item in this price range, it shouldn't have switch problems in the first 3 months. When it works, it works great."
5,"Festive, Holiday Cheer!","For those new to Handel, or classical music, this is a great introduction. The music is light, cheerful, and adds to the holiday feeling."
4,Good utility stool,"The wife, who is moderately height challenged, needed a stool to reach the top of the pantry. I picked up this one at Amazon. It's a good stool and it folds very flat (which she wanted). Opening is a breeze. Closing slightly less so (hence the deduction of 1 star). But it is sturdy, stores flat (about 1"" thick) and it works well for her. I would definitely buy it again."
1,bad description,"I returned this because it did not fit my mixer. The KA website says it ""Fits models K5, KP50 and KSM5."" NOT KSM90 as it says in the description. Boo."
2,"Great heater, not built to last.","This heater WAS great, but stopped working after only 5 months. I should have sent it back when I first assembled it. I noticed the tilt clamp was not only difficult to assemble, but didn't really function well(tilting). So we basically had to put it on the floor. We enjoyed the warmth, up to 20 feet away. I wouldn't buy another one though after it konked out so soon, the tilt quality, and the size as well."
4,simple but complex,A very pointed movie about a young man and his bicyle. It tells of the struggles facing a young uneducated man trying to carve out a place in society. Worth watching with the english captions.
3,Hatteras West,"5th in Myers' first series featuring Alex Winston and his lighthouse inn in the Blue Ridge Mountains, this mystery focuses on the huge emerald that Alex has agreed to host a display of in one of his rooms. When the guard is murdered and the emerald is switched with a fake in the last hour of the display, Alex and his manager, Elise, look high and low to find clues as to who committed this heinous act in their beloved inn. In the midst of the murder, there is a local muffin war going on between a new baker in town and the local diner, who has provided the inn with their breakfasts since the inn began serving them. On top of that, there is a new fancy restaurant in town, and Alex has become embroiled in helping the new owner survive in the small town. Following Alex and Elise in their adventures is a pleasant pastime, but not an overwhelmingly involved one."
3,Weak!,"I really enjoyed the Lighthouse series until I got to the last two. They were weak and seemed contrived, no heart. It was as if Mr. Myers felt he had to add to the series and did so quickly without much thought, energy or effort!"
1,Don't buy this or other spherical puzzles by this manufactur,"I bought a spherical puzzle of the moon. The problem is that the pieces intentionally don't fit together perfectly to get the puzzle to hold the spherical shape. Consequently, you'll find two pieces that you think will fit. When you turn them over, where each piece has a number encoding its order, you'll discover you were wrong. Basically, you can't tell if you've assembled the thing correctly unless you cheat.Second, even when you find two that are sequenced together, you have to pound -- and pound hard -- to get them to fit. After one attempt to get ten pieces to go together, my fingertips were so sore that I had to give up for the rest of the night.I'm an idiot savant at assembling jigsaw puzzles, but I gave up on this one. It wasn't worth the literal pain to put it together."
1,Pieces dont fit together!,"This is a nifty idea for a puzzle, but it needs some work. The pieces don't fit together! I couldn't even get the base of mine to fit together perfectly (or even close to perfectly) and that part is flat! After a few tries, I finally gave up out of frustration at the pieces falling apart so often!"
2,Your time would be better spent elsewhere,"This puzzle does not offer much of a challenge. It is solved by following a numeric sequence (ie. place #1 w/ piece #2) which are printed on the back. Secondly, the pieces don't fit together well. We had to implement a glass to pound the pieces together. When we reached the north pole, we had to just place (not interlocking the pieces) the top for fear of it crashing down. Therefore, as avid ""puzzlers,"" we cannot recommend this puzzle with good conscience."
1,Don't Buy It,"As much as this puzzle costs, you should be able to undo one piece without the pieces tearing. This puzzle is so hard to put together. We got all of the way to the top and then it was impossible to make the puzzle stay together while you finished the last few pieces. There were no instructions included. We figured out how to put it together and it is not fun like a normal puzzle. All you do is put the numbers in sequence. How fun is that!!! Then it keeps falling apart so that youcan't even finish the puzzle. Needless to say it went in the garbage can."
2,Inside paint...????,"I have the robin's egg blue kettle, it is very pretty and works well. My concern is with the inside paint. I have washed and used the kettle for over 1.5 years. My concern is that after washing and rinsing it, I have black smears on a paper towel after wiping the inside. Does anyone else have this problem? A solution? I wonder what it is painted with and if it is unhealthy to use the kettle?"
1,Avoid this manufacturer at all costs,"The previous review about substandard service is spot-on. The DVD-RW drive that came in my Averatec 3300 series laptop was complete garbage (my DVD-RW was made by QSI, I don't know if that's standard in Averatec laptops or if the manufacturer varies.) I couldn't get it to read DVDs or burn DVD-Rs without many errors.After extensively searching Google I found quite a few other people who had the same problem and I was led to suspect it was a firmware issue, and the Averatec website didn't have any firmware upgrades, nor did the QSI site (which was mostly in Chinese and the little bit of English was very broken English.) So, I emailed Averatec asking if they knew where I could get a firmware upgrade. They refused to help unless I faxed them a copy of the original sales receipt, which I no longer had.Bad product, bad support, stay away!"
3,The Joy of Reviewing a drawn out book....,"This book had a nice flow, but got away from the main topic of the book and spun around to a long drawn out autobiography of her accomplisments. Veronica Chambers came across as a braggart. I would have appreicated the book more, if she created a character that shared similar experiences. If I had to choose between bying a cup of Starbucks coffee or buying this book, I'd choose the coffee."
3,Delightfully fun album; Opera for YOU!,"Opera unfortunatley has the reputation for being uppity and pretentious, but this album shows that Opera can be fun and entertaining. This album is SUPERB for just listening to as you work, eat, or sleep. Especially if you've recently been turned on to Opera by Mr. Andrea Bocelli, you'll enjoy the rich diversity of this album. You know the tenor; how about soprano, etc? Grab a bowl of spaghetti, pour a glass of wine (or grape juice) and enjoy ""Puccini & Pasta""!"
1,My Review,"This might have been a good game in its time , but it wont even play on a system with Vista or newer operating system.Their should be a warning for games this old about that."
5,the best that music can be,"I first heard this man play about 35 years ago and I've felt ever since that he is in a class by himself. Like Tatum, his fingers seem to fly effortlessly up and down the keys, and I have NEVER heard him stumble. There seems to be no barrier between his endless ideas and flawless execution. There doesen't seem to be anything that he cannot play...and play with brilliance, imagination, fire, grace and humor. And he must be pushing 80 by now! His junior sidemen here are is equal in many ways, and thier joyfull interplay is infectious. This is simply beautiful music, without pretension, at once traditional and spontanious, not needing any promotion or hype, uncorruptable in its purity. These are artists and musicians in the truest sense of the words. So, enough words. Listen and be uplifted. Bless you all."
5,Two Can Keep A Secret.....,"I enjoy the songs on this album, one of which is the theme song for the currently popular TV series, Pretty Little Liars."
3,Not bad,"I like this album more than I thought I would from reading all the other reviews. It has a solid 7-9 songs out of 13, which is quite impressive of any album. I like their voices, and they can be funky."
1,How did they let this happen,"I am a huge eels fan, and their live stuff is as good as it gets, but this album sounds terrible. his vocals are up too loud or something and his vocals just aren't strong enough to carry notes with music that quiet behind him. I was really excited for this album, becuase there is not a blemish on any of the eels or e's studio albums, buy them all, but I am going to stash this one under the bed and pretend it didn't happen."
1,Useless,"Useless, does not work, no instructions included, a total waste of time trying to figure out how it works and money...Totally, Totally Useless!!!"
1,It would be great if it worked.,"The design is nice, it runs smooth. It's extremely easy to use, but the only problem is it doesn't work. If you type in a question you'll get an answer that is sort of mixed up, all the numbers are there, just out of order. The idea is great but the product is useless."
1,Well for starters...,"The pan I received is not from the catering line, it is not a saucier, and the capacity is not 3.35 quarts. I tested it by filling it with water - 3 quarts of water fit right up to the rim. Trying to decide whether I should give it to my daughter, or return it. Very disappointed. Bottom line - if you want a 2.8 quart saucepan from the Sitram Proffiserie line, this is your pan. If you want a 3.35 quart saucier from the Catering line, look elsewhere. False advertising."
5,Great Product,"My overall objective of buying this product was to utilize my iPaq 3900 series (which was laying in my draw from last 3 years and doing nothing) by converting it into GPS receiver display. I bought BT-359W GPS receiver (which is also very impressive) and attached that to my iPaq using Bekin product. The connectivity was so smooth. Never drop the signals. It (Belkin F8T006 Bluetooth Wireless CompactFlash CF and PCMCIA type II PDA and PC Adapter Combo Card) worked very efficiently, not only with my GPS receiver, but other BT supported devices as well. The only problem, I had so far, is that my iPaq gets hang if I turned it off and on back again. Could not figure out why is it doing this? The interim solution of this problem is to perform a soft reset in my iPaq and then every thing works great.Overall this product, really worked great. I am happy that I utilized some thing from my old stock. Now my iPaq is out of my old stock draw and that space is empty for some thing else"
4,Target Located... Processing...,"The Sentinel is finally here! And boy does he shake up the HeroClix game! This bad boy is a one man army with variable stats depending on the situation. He incites fear into your opponents HeroClix team just by being on the table. He's made of a hard plastic and is very durable. I've already dropped him at least 3 times today, and his paint hasn't chipped yet. As usual Wizkids has put out another awesome minature."
5,Stops baby's crying every time!,"I got this CD as a gift when I was pregnant and thought it was pretty goofy. In fact, I don't particularly care for the zylophone music on the CD, it gets a bit annoying without the lyrics. But now that it has hushed my little one up on all of 10 occassions without fail, I'm a big fan of it! If she's crying in the car, I just pop in the Rockabye Baby CD and she automatically hushes up! No other sound has this profound an effect on her. It's almost eerie how automatic her hushing is upon hearing the music. I highly recommend this CD for anyone with a new infant."
4,Another Great Story By Parshall,"As with the previous books in his 'Chambers of Justice' series, Craig Parshall delivers another top notch story.Attorney Will Chambers is retained to defend a Marine Corps colonel who has been accused of multiple murder in an anti-terrorist mission gone badly awry. Along with Chamber's defense of the colonel, he has to deal with a grandstanding U.S. senator and a heavy handed prosecution in the International Criminal Court.It is a great story throughout. There is good courtroom drama as well as military action. Aong with those main plot elements are Christian themes of prayer, faith, and forgiveness.This story is well done and not to be missed by Parshall fans. For those who have not read him before, I recommend starting with 'The Resurrection File', which is the first one in this collection. Do yourself a favor and check out this series by Craig Parshall."
3,military drama,"will chambers is on his honeymoon when he receives an urgent request from an army colonel on the brink of court martial, so begins another rollercoaster journey of courtroom battles and international politics with a decent smattering of military drama. who killed chambers first wife? he must unlock the secrets of the past in order to save his futurei found this book to be good but more stodgy than the first two with the storyline being weighed down at times with a little too much detail and dialogue"
3,stuck shut,The sticky tape(if used as designed) seals the battery compartment shut. This can be fixed by cutting down the tape to not cover the battery door. The alarm works fine in my none automatic defrost freezer.
2,not impressed,"First unit arrived DOA. Not worth the hassle to deal with the warranty requirements. Bought a second. As others have noted, the double-sticky mounting tape makes it impossible to replace the battery without destroying (and replacing) the tape. Also, as others have noted, alarm volume is pathetically low."
2,works but too quiet,Although this items audio alarm works as described the alarm is so soft you need to be within a very short distance of it to hear it. Also the suction cup does not stick to my freezers interior at all. The visual part of the alarm is almost microscopic in size.
2,Works but too quiet,"Good for the price but may not be the best choice depending on were your freezer is. The alarm on this item was rather quiet, surprisingly so, and if I weren't in the same space as the freezer it's unlikely it would draw attention through a closed door."
2,Does not do well with auto-defrost freezers,"Auto-defrost refrigerators/freezers cycle their temperature between 0 degrees F and above 25 degrees F. Unfortunately, this alarm doesn't accomodate the cycle resulting in false alarms. The owners manual offers a cop-out solution, ""wrap the sensor in foam"". OK -- so how does one calibrate the sensor and know that it is set properly? It would take a lot of trial an error, adding foam, removing foam . . . who has time for that? It needs a switch where the consumer can pick the alarm temperature."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I purchased the alarm because my kids were always leaving the freezer door open resulting in defrosted popsicles, ice cream, meat, and the like. I bought the alarm and installed it as directed after spending a day defrosting the large, upright freezer. (Both my husband and I are engineers, so you can be certain we followed the directions to a ""T"".) To my surprise, two days later the freezer door was open, frost had built up on the metal shelves, and NO ALARM WAS GOING OFF! I pulled the alarm off the instructed location and put it outside the freezer to see if maybe the batteries were bad. No, the alarm sounded. DO NOT BUY THIS! We now have to defrost the freezer for the second time in a week. I plan to return this worthless device."
4,A good idea,"Easy to install. Has already saved us once when the GFI circuit it's attached to tripped. No false alarms yet when we put in food, even though it is on a deep freezer with a front swinging door."
2,Not loud enough to be useful,"I bought 2 of these for the basement deep freezers. They work OK, but unless you are very close to these units, you will not hear the alarm, i.e., you'd have to be in the same room to be able to hear it. Much lower volume than an avarage alarm clock, which is usually even closer to you when it sounds. I'd not buy this product unless you know someone will likely be in the same room as the freezer."
4,Knock on Wood,"So far so good. I am in the basement alot, I have a studio/office there so we would be able to hear it down here. I hope we never have to test it. I learned the hard way that for under 20 bucks, it could have prevented a lot of head aches. Ours was about for a week before we noticed it...I had open it to get dinner out.....but we were in that room every day! to feed the cats and dogs. Had there been an alarm we could have saved hundreds of dollars worth of meat. Get it now before you fill your freezer!"
1,Poorly designed,CDN Audio Visual Freezer AlarmThe alarm sounds when the freezer goes into defrost cycle. This may occur several times a day. Who wants to keep checking on the freezer every time the alarm sounds.Save your money!!!!!!!
1,Junk,"Bought two of these, both defective. What else can I say. Its a struggle to get them returned (from Amana). Alarm sounds 100% of the time, regardless of how it is installed or how many times it is reset. Thermometer say below zero, this alarm goes off all the time. Worthless."
4,Worth the money,"This is the second alarm that we have purchased. The first one broke after several years. I believe the wire that goes into the freezer broke, but it alerted us to an open freezer door on several occasions. It definitely paid for itself. I just wish the alarm was a little louder."
1,Expensive for what you get.,"This is my second M9 style bayonet. The first was a cheaper version which I returned. The first knife was dull and cheaply made but it fastened securely to my Mossberg 590 shotgun. Wanting more I purchased this one expecting to get much better product since I was paying twice as much. It did come with a decent edge and had a much better feel to it. However feature wise it had less then the cheap knock off. Once fitted to my shotgun it flopped around so bad I thought it would fall off. After 20 min toying with it I realized the handle is about 1/8"" longer then it should be which prevents it from properly fitting on my shotgun. This is a real deal breaker as I can find a better knife for less since this will not attach securely to a M9 mount."
1,WindChaser Oil Filled Heater: Problems,"I bought the WindChaser 7-Fin Oil Filled Heater for $29.99 at a medium sized chain of Home Improvement Centers in Upstate, NY. I was searching for a 600 Watt heater and the box labels the power settings as 600/900/1500 Watt which is false. The actual settings are 700/800/1500 Watt so I am very wary of this product. Four wheels come that you attach to plates at the bottom of the fins and one wheel broke when I was inserting it so the heater is tipped to one corner so the oil is not properly distributed to heat. The heat settings are merely numbers and the instructions don't tell you where the thermostat is to measure the air temperature. In my opinion, these are too many problems ""out of the box"" so I am returning it."
5,Emblematic and desert island choices!,"Dvorak's immense talent as composer of chamber works deserve to him, even a major status that most of people tend to estimate. The spirit of eloquency, sheer lyricism and brisky musicality make of this set a true must-have.Don't miss this set under any pretext."
2,A disappointing effort from a usually flawless author.,"Donald, Donald, Donald. I picked this book up with a giddiness only experienced when I pick up a Westlake or Lawerence Block book. I was sadly disappointed. The story was long and dragged out and the plot, if you can call it a plot, was without a sense of reality. I only finished this book because of the Westlake name. Thank you but I'll stick to rereading my Dortmunder novels"
2,A disappointing effort from a usually flawless author.,"Donald, Donald, Donald. I picked this book up with a giddiness only experienced when I pick up a Westlake or Lawerence Block book. I was sadly disapointed. The story was long and dragged out and the plot, if you can call it a plot, was without a sense of reality. I only finished this book because of the Westlake name. Thank you but I'll stick to rereading my Dortmunder novels"
2,My Hopes Went Up In Smoke,"After all the hype about Donald E. Westlake, I decided to read one of his novels to get in on the fun. Maybe SMOKE is an exception to his usually good romps, but I was really bored throughout the novel. With the exception of a couple of characters, the rest of them were stereotyped, formless and boring. So much could have been done with this great plot. Oh, well.... I won't give up on Mr. Westlake. His Dortmunder novels get great press, so guess I'll give one of those a try. I WANT to like his writing. So many people do! Help me out, folks. Am I missing something?!!"
2,Could have been so much better.,"The idea and concept of this book is just fantastic.. ""An Invisible Thief, running around New York""... What a Fantastic Idea!. I was expecting big laughs and a great plot. What I got was a very slow read with a gutless plot. The laughs where few, far between and not really funny. This book just did not go anywhere, it could have been done so much better and with much more punch. The main character was pretty good, and some of the supporting characters (especially Jersey Josh) carried the book along, but the underlying plot of the tobacco industry was poorly done. I was disappointed, but this book is for you if you want a simple, mind numbing read."
2,Not Large Print,I bought this as a gift for someone with poor eyesight and found that it IS NOT large print. Very disappointed.
5,Thinline Bible,Product is as described and was received promptly. I am completly satisfied with my purchase
1,Red letter---- boo,"Any one needing large print doesn't need the difficulty of the red print if this had been pointed out, I would NOT have purchased it. The black print is good. Of course the meat of the new testament is in red. Not a very good color to see, especially for any one needing large print. I would NOT recommend this edition to anyone else. I am making do."
5,Bible,I like the Thinline Bible because it also has a concordance in the back plus other Bible related information. The lighter weight and smaller size works well for taking it with me.
5,Great Quality!,Great quality from cover to cover! Large print and thin Bible. Light weight and easy to read. It is great!
5,"Great Find, Great New Band.... Even better LIVE... Great CD","I was in Portsmouth about a month ago and saw them live, they were and are terrific. I bought the CD right then and loved every track. I've since bought a couple for friends. ""Chapter In Verse"" is definately on their way up....I would recommend the CD as a must for any new artists."
5,"Chapter in Verse, a well kept secret","""Wicked Smile"", the highly anticipated debut CD from Boston based Chapter in Verse was well worth the wait. Lead vocalists Rachel Clayton and Brenda Whyte have proven that the energy and charisma they have brought to stages throughout New England can be transplanted into the recording studio. In a word ""Wicked Smile"" is exceptional! The music is both melodic and exhilarating, the lyrics are meaningful, their voices are strong and sincere. All in all Chapter in Verse is the most well rounded band I have heard in a very long time. ""Wicked Smile"" is really just the tip of the iceberg for these outstanding musicians. ""Wicked Smile"", Check it out!"
4,Hard to find,"I used to use Dr Scholls bunion pads, but they quit making the non felt kind, which these are. The thicker foam shields the bunion better in my opinion. The only problem is the adhesive is not as strong, so I have to add tape to hold them in place, but it is worth it to be able to use this kind. I will buy again when needed."
2,Not as described...NOT FULLY COMPATIBLE!!!,Good case...functional charger...*headset NOT COMPATIBLE with the Nokia 1100!!!* Completely different connector type...LOOK CLOSELY at the product photo!
1,never received sent wendall ? where are the scout flanders,never received got wendall instead either they never received or problem with enter info
3,trouble on a stick,"I just tried my first recipe with this new pan and I was soooo disappointed. I used a butter cake mix and the weight of the icing made it too heavy for the stick and the cake sank to the bottom of the stick. I tried sticking the cake-sicles in a piece of foam for a cute presentation and the sticks came through the cake. I'm not ready to give up yet, I just won't try cake again. The Rice Krispies Treats look good though, but I could have shaped them without the pan. Maybe I should have used a denser kind of cake mix."
2,Not what i expected,"this was not what i expected used pre made cookie dough, and it was a mess......the sticks would not hold they kept tearing out of the cookie. I would suggest not even use this form and just buy the Popsicle sticks and insert the sticks into the cookie dough and by pass this pan together. used it once and put it in a garage sale...save your money"
3,Not great yet,The idea is great and probably will work someday when I master the concept. The cakes ripped off the sticks so I'm guessing I used too much batter. Hopefully I'll figure it out before I really need them since they will be great if it works.
4,Good product...,"It would be better without the non-stick coating, which always tends to over-brown everything; for those having issues with the cake sliding on the sticks, dip the sticks in a bit of melted chocolate before insertion, and let it set up a couple minutes before picking up the cakes."
4,Recipes??,"It would have been nice to get more recipes with the pan or, at least, a conversion chart to modify cookie and cake recipes. That being said, it is a nice pan, not too thin. It arrived in perfect condition. It does come with some popsicle sticks so you don't have to buy them right away unless you plan on baking dozens of pops the first time."
3,Item Works well but novelty is so so.,I really liked teh concept of this item but when we actually used it with the kids they got bored of it easily. The quality of the product is totally fine just the concept is just ok.
2,Caution,"The guitar is a refurb Yamaha C-45. The guitar arrived w/o an invoice, very little packing and damaged. I had to pay for return shipping and contact the company and ask for my money back."
4,Gets the job done,"I had to buy this book for a class, but given textbooks in general, this one is perfectly adequate."
3,Good to startup with but need to add more punch for techies,"This book is a good source for beginners who wants learn to manipulate the files and use simple TSO commands in MVS/TSO area. Illustration with screen samples are superb. As a guide for developers, I did not find the author handling the subject in depth."
1,Boring and Dry,"Database Systems is probably the dullest subject I have encountered in Computer Science, and this book tends to exacerbate the problem. The authors fails to craft good examples, and if you are not already familiar with databases, you will be left behind by the authors' assumptions of your knowledge..."
4,Children's book,My grandsons really like Scooby Doo so they have enjoyed these books. They have us all read them over and over.
2,Story Reader Scooby-Doo 3-Storybook Library,"While the grand daughters loved the Scooby movies, this book was a little disappointing. It was a voice telling the story with no Scooby character voices.Chill Out Scooby-Doo! - Original Movie"
4,Songs that make your flesh creep,"I love the album Faerie Goddess; it has chants and songs that are warm, loving and beautiful. Since I got this cd I had to know more of this Faery Elaine, as she calls herself sometimes.She isn't really professional, but her voice makes you flesh creep. Ballads and chearful songs, in a total of 13 songs.Although I have to say that some texts, like: don't you know you're body is a temple, the earth is a witch and nine million european women died; isn't an accurate thing to say; because it that is just a romantic idea of female witches. But if you look beyond that: it really sounds very nice!I also have Faeries, dreams and Other Friends, which is a cd full of American Children Songs, such as; Puff the Magic Dragon and Teddy Bears'Picnic. Sadly you can't obtain it from this site. ..."
3,soso,Material gets dirty very quick.Very bright red almost looks pink in some light.Get blue or black.
4,"Comfortable, stylish boots","I've been looking for comfortable boots for YEARS, that I could wear both to work and in casual settings. These definitely work. They are wider than most boots (which I generally need), they have some cushioning (another plus) and are generally comfortable. They do run a bit large, though!"
5,Harley-Davidson Men's Interstate Zip Boot,"This is one nice pair of boots. If you are looking for a pair of boots that are functional and look good, this is what you need to order! Go get ya some!"
5,Exewent!,"These boots are exewent! They're comfortable, easy to take on and off, and of course they're Harley Davidson! The only drawback is that they run small, size wise. I ordered a 14 because I wear a 15 tennis shoe, and I shouldve ordered a 15."
4,Comedians Turned Loose to do Music Video,"Comedy Videos features thirteen music videos done by some of the great comedians of a few decades ago. It is really great to see some of these comedians again and they do some most unusual and funny things. John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd THE BLUES BROTHERS in ""Hey Bartender"", Mel Brooks' does ""To Be or Not to Be/Hitler Rap"". John Candy and Eugene Levy present ""The Last Polka"", Julie Brown does ""The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun"" (a little too true to be funny in my estimation), Eric Idle shares ""Piggie in the Middle"", Gary Trudeau does ""Rap Master Ronnie"", Jimmy Picker gives us the Academy Award-winning ""Sundae in New York"" and MY FAVORITE, BOB AND RAY with Gilda Radner, Loraine Newman and Jane Curtin do ""Don't You Think I'm Sexy"". If you like music videos and great comedians, you should love this video."
1,I had to force myself to finish this book.,"It was written in the 70's and boy, can you ever tell. The female character is powerless, confused, and lets herself be ruled by any of 3 different men, all of this in SPITE of the fact that she is supposedly the embodiment of the Norse goddess Freyja. Over this weak foundation, Paxson includes overdone political commentary on the Viet Nam war (it felt as if she really wanted to talk about Viet Nam, and wrote the Freyja story as an aside), male characters who are flat and predictable, a storyline that tries, but fails, to sell itself, and superficial exploration of dated stereotypes.I read the book through, hoping that it would redeem itself. It didn't. For me, the only enjoyable aspect of this book was that it let me flex my critic's muscles long enough to articulate just WHY I hated it. If you like good mythological or fantasy fiction, AVOID this book."
2,Too light and flimsy,"This lid is surprisingly light-weight compared to the Profiserie pans themselves, which are good solid pans designed for restaurant use. It has a thin sharp rim that has become dinged in normal use. If you want a Sitram lid, the lids from the Catering line are much better made. If you just need a lid for you pan check the yellow pages under Restaurant Supplies.On the positive side, at least the handle does not heat up and doesn't require a side towel to remove the lid."
3,It was alright,This was not quite what I expected but it was fun and end product was good. The pieces didn't fit well together but with puzzle glue it stayed together. Over all it was fun and made a nice decoration in my room.
3,Fun short game.,"The numbers on the backsides of each piece make the puzzle easy to put together, but not very challenging. It took me about half an hour to put together, which is not very long considering the amount of pieces that it has. The sides fall in a lot and it is hard to hold without part of the sphere caving in. The puzzle does go together well and is fun for a short time."
4,Well worth the read for a beginner.,"This book provided an excellent intro into ALL radio, not just shortwave. The book title ignores the fact that the book deals with HAM and Scanner radio. Also, it was a bit elementary, but was filled with lots of helpful explanations and references. For a novice like me it was perfect! Well worth the read."
2,too young,"The book itself is good but I couldn't find any description of age appropriateness. It was too young for my 3 year old granddaughter, plus the book is only about 10 pages long. The book also had dot to dots from 1-10 only. Wanted something a little harder."
2,not worth it for the price,"I only bought this as filler to get free shipping....It was over a dollar and definitely not worth a dollar. There's not many pages, you can get much more for your money at Walmart or dollar store....but it works as a free shipping filler I guess..."
2,"Even if you like other work by the author, get this one from the library","It's 82 pages. As of 22September2012, the Kindle price is $8.99. If you've read Harrison's ""The Kiss"" (which actually is book-length), you've already read the essential themes in more depth than offered by the extremely small treatment in ""The Mother Knot."" I consider ""The Kiss"" an outstanding memoir, a literary work, a powerful book. I purchased ""The Kiss"" and have read it more than once. ""The Mother Knot"" reminds me of the Christmas letters some people send out to everyone they know to say, ""Here's what's happened in the year(s) since you last heard from me."" As little as I care for those Christmas letters, some of them were better reads than ""The Mother Knot."""
2,Very disappointing,"I had such a hard time finishing this very short memoir. It was very short but packed with lots of reflections. I had read ""The Kiss"" a memoir also written by Kathryn Harrison and thought it was powerful so I thought this one would be equally as good--or better but no. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. My mind kept wandering to other books I have--that I would much rather be reading. :("
2,Bare Minimum,"I bought Bullet Witch back in the fall of 2009. I fully cleared the game for all achievements and then put it away as soon as possible. I wanted to like this game, but ended up only liking the main character. It seems they poured most of their budget into her creation and rushed everything else. It seems like they originally intended to create a different game. I say this because the levels are not always linear, yet often you will reach a dead end that has nothing of interest; nothing to kill, nothing to pick up... just nothing. The graphics are subpar, the environments are not detailed and the enemies uninspired. Also, the enemies are recycled over and over. I remember mostly relying on 1 gun to beat the game on all difficulties. Basically the end product was a good start, a rough draft, nothing more."
2,Is There A Spell T o Refund My Money?,"Too bad you can't use curse words on Amazon, because there would be a ****load right now. This game is filled with good intentions and some nice ideas, but just not thought out as well as it should have. Mowing down demon soliers in a suburban neighborhood should be alot funner than this. And while the magic effects are nice, the overall feel of this game is very mediocre; The movements are awkward, and while some of the graphics are nice and sharp, the overall bland enviornments will just have you shaking your head. Sure, all the explosions look 'purty', but don't they all on Next Gen? This could have a been a really fun guilty pleasure with a little more effort behind it, but instead it's just very ho-hum. Another year in development could have maybe turned this around. But....Just play Bloodrayne 2 again."
4,Not as Bad as They Say,"I liked this game. The voice acting could have been better, but the game had a great atmosphere and one felt that you were really experience a hell on earth apocalypse. I found the game to be challenging and got killed several times on my first playthrough. However, your able to keep your upgrades on subsequent playthroughs which increases playability. Using spells along with bullets makes this game shine.I would support a sequel or a remake, but I don't think either one will happen. Although lesser games have gotten second chances."
2,Lost potential..... But give credit for the effort.,"Yes this game isn't the best of its class but it was a very hard concept to make and by this 3rd party Developer Atari that made games such as Enter the matrix and so on, One can't really expect an Award winning ""Game of the Year"" Franchise to follow through. This game would have been more successful had it been Rated Teen since the gameplay is simplistic as Devil may Cry and there was no need for the ultra gore. Overall Its an above average game that didn't do too hot in the market that was targeted for a small group of gamers. Not too bad but not too great either."
2,"ANOTHER CRAPPY FEMALE HERO, WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Lets face it, everytime a videogame incorporates a female leading character, the game turn into ruins....examples??? red ninja (sucked),nightshade (sucked) tomb raider ( sucks), aeon flux (sucks),like that there are many.....bulletwitch is no exemption, SHE SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!! shes a gungrave, devil may cry wanna be, thats all she is..the game is pretty boring, feels just like gungrave, its for sure a gungrave rip-off...but then again, atari does not make great games either.....this game is a rental at most...its not worth your 49.99....buy a real mens game, BUY GOD OF WAR 2 INSTEAD!!!!!!!!"
1,"Terrible, just terrible.","I got this game based on a preview video I watched. Sexy girl, big guns, stuff blowing up, whats not to like right? Boy was I wrong. There is very little to do in this game. Theres no ammo to pick or health to find (you have unlimited ammo and your health regenerates pretty fast). The enemy AI is horrible as well as your allies. Aiming your weapon is difficult and jerky. You run FOREVER through unnecessarily vast landscapes. There is very little challenge. I played the game for a few HOURS praying for something interesting to happen. Finally after two or three stages, I come upon what i perceived to be a boss. Big guy 4 or 5 stories tall with a giant machine gun for an arm. Yes! Finally something to do...I killed him with one spell...seriously...I didn't even have to move. I could go on and on but I wont. Dont buy this game, dont rent it, forget it ever existed."
4,"Don't compare it to major titles, just have fun","This game is not at all bad. As far as 'B' title games would go, this one was very fun. Of course there are better games out there; I get tired of people comparing a game like this to Gears of War, etc. Not all games are going to be 100/100.I picked this up in the store on the sale rack, having never heard of it. I came into the game with no expectations, but by the end of it, it was a great game. It had its little hiccups from time to time but overall, it was a very fun game to pick up, play, beat, and put down."
4,Decent Game,"If you like to shoot your way through tons of guys with a big gun, then your in the right place. Gorgeous graphics, decent magic spells, and the lead role is a chick. The only problem i found with the game is the A.I. can be kind of well...""Dumb"" at times, all in all, there is some fun to be had with BulletWitch."
3,cool game,"Recv'd in GOOD condition , used . . with booklet and case.This game is addicting and very fun! I had some difficulty aiming the Flaming Death Rose thingie but it was dang cool when it hit. Her different rifle configs were pretty neat. The enemies are ruthless and numerous , kind of a pain! But hey that's why she's got unlimited refills on ammo! LoLEasy to play and good - looking game! I recommend it"
3,worth the gamer points,it has an original concept with an ok but kind of weak story line. the graphics are pretty good.
4,bullit witch is good not great,the game is not that much cash so if your looking for a game to wast some time on it not that bad and its kinda fun but on the higher setting it gets hard to play and the bullets dont hit the mark every time
5,The Game-Season 3,"All I have to say is EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT... Paramount did not change the music for the DVD Home Edition. So it is just like watching it on TV."
4,"Memoirs of ""the Magician""","Van Buren wrote his memoirs in the 1850s while living in England. The work covers the period from his early political carrer in New York through Andrew Jackson's presidency. Van Buren's own presidency in not covered. His anecdotes regarding Jackson, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John Calhoun are interesting and stimulate one to read more of the era. The animosity between the Federalist and Republican parties in the early 19th century is also a common theme. There is a lot of self-serving fluff regarding issues the affected Van Buren the politician as the book passes the halfway point and my interest here waned. Van Buren never mentions his wife--although his sons are mentioned. If you are interested in this era of American history and have a prior grasp of the issues at hand, this work may provide some enjoyable and entertaining insight into the period."
5,Product as described!,The butterfly lamp was delivered very quickly and was just as described!Excellent vendor!
5,Beautiful Butterfly Tiffany Lamp-Perfect Gift & Treasure!,"I purchased this Lamp and one similar as gifts for my Mother and Daughter. They adored their gifts and this item is a wonderful gift idea for anyone who likes to have Tiffany & a warm, nitelite type Lamp in their home or office. The Tiffany colors are brilliant when the Light is one and the glow is a warm, decorative to add to any piece of furniture. They are a good large size and very well made. I now have the one I gave to my Mother next to her portrait, which is on all the time. I love the peace and tranquility it fills me with decorating my office. Again, I consider this a Superb & lovely gift which will be highly appreciated and enjoyed!"
5,Great pain Relief,Relieves pain in sore muscles without massage or medication. Convenient spray keeps hands from absorbing medication so you don't rub it your eyes or other unintended places.
5,Cyroderm,I thought the product was great. It was nice not to have to put a cream on your back which ends up on your clothes. I used it on my husband for his back pain.
2,NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS THE GEL!!!,"HAVING PURCHASED BOTH THE GEL AND THE SPRAY, I'VE FOUND THAT THERE'S NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO. THE SPRAY IS VERY WATERY AND ONLY SPRAYS IN A ""PUDDLE"" REGARDLESS OF HOW THE SPRAYER IS SET. FURTHERMORE, THE GEL SEEMS TO LAST LONGER WHEN IT COMES TO PAIN RELIEF."
5,Good pain reduction product,"My wife has Fibromyalgia and was using the product StopPain. The Cryoderm works even a little better. We buy it in the large bottle with a spray top, and it puts out enough volume that the bottle doesn't last very long. However, even though it's expensive, it's worth it. It's a counter irritant, so some people's skin might not be up to using it."
5,"CryoDerm, a great product.....it works",I have used this product for some time. (Around three years.) I am a repeat user. It gives me immediate relief from back pain. I would reccomend this product to anyone looking for IMMEDIATE pain relief.
3,"DVD is not what I expected, I was hoping for a CD.","This is a fun game with lot of mental test involved, it was in a cd format first, then it came out in DVD. I couldv'e sworn that the game was in CD format."
5,A must play!,Wow this is a great game. Even better than Myst. The graphics are better and also the story. The only down side to Riven is that you have to keep putting in CD.
5,Riven Rocks!,"This game is so cool it is not to be believed. I LOVE IT! If you thought that the graphics were good in Myst, Riven's are 10 times better. The story is amazing. I loved the way all of the pieces were connected. It took a while to get everything sorted out but once I did it was really cool. The only bad thing is that you can easily overlook some important things while you are on some islands, but the way everything looks makes up for it. Sometimes I could actually imagine I was in Riven. It is one very cool game."
5,Full Immersion,"I enjoyed Riven more than Myst. Riven was more difficult than Myst, for me, but I still only needed two hints to complete Riven. I would highly recommend Riven to adventure gamers. It really has set a new standard for the genre. Haven't played Exile yet, but I wanted to complete Riven before moving on to #3. What these Cyan games possess - far above any other adventure games I've played - are smart, subtle story lines that really keep your attention. How refreshing to play a game that respects the player's intelligence and sense of inquisitiveness and adventure. I know I'm hooked when I think about a game throughout my day. Riven does become your world. Finally, like Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings,' the Myst games possess subtle yet compelling Christian symbols - a spiritually fulfilling experience."
4,"Enjoyable, frustrating","I told myself I was NOT going to use any hints to solve Riven. Actually I got through most of the game without hints. But then I got frustrated and finally gave in and got help. Riven is perhaps the most difficult of the Myst series. The one critical puzzle involving coded locks was so difficult that after finding the solution online, and realizing I had been on the right track towards the solution, still there was no way I would have cracked the full code, even though I had deciphered some of the code on my own. As with other Myst games, there was also one important area that I didn't find on my own, because I didn't click around enough (a small and non-obvious hot spot). There are fewer ages in Riven than in the other Myst games, and about 95% of the game consists of finding your way around the islands that make up the first age. In that respect it is a different game experience than the others. The prerendered point-and-click interface is much like the original Myst."
3,Too opened-ended for most.,"Riven looks like Myst. Riven sounds like Myst. Riven plays like Myst...sort of. The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst, you start on a small island, told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven, you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed. The game ran fine on Windows 98."
3,"Well, it's better than Myst","I enjoy playing the Myst games once through, they are fun and challenging. However my computer would not allow me to hit a certain switch for some reason, and I was therefore never able to get to the location on the cover. Even if I had, I would never play the game again, I would know how to do everything, and therefore, what would be the point? At least it is better then Myst in which you can win within about 15 minutes of starting the game, but still... Any 60 dollar game (as it was when it was released) should last longer than this. With the detail put in, the game itself is rather short, with puzzle solving accounting for much of your time. Also some puzzles can be so frustrating when you know what to do, but can't (the stopping the scopes thing, the puzzle at the top of the dome on the first island). I thought it was a beautiful game, but I wouldn't get it unless it is below 20 dollars, otherwise I don't really think it's worth it."
3,Not my favorite puzzle/adventure game.,"This may just be my personal preferences, but here's what I think about Riven.The graphics are beautiful, stunning even...but not as beautiful or stunning as those in, say, The Legacy of Time.The puzzles are thought-provoking, but they can sometimes be difficult or impossible to understand simply because you don't know what you're looking for: there's no internal logic to the puzzles. In, say, the 7th Guest each puzzle has a clear goal, and a clear set of rules/guidelines/parameters.The worst problem, though, is that it's lonely. I just find myself wishing for more people.My recommendation? Borrow it from a friend or rent a copy from a video game store to see whether you enjoy it before you purchase it at full price."
1,Not for newer computers,I loved the Myst game of years ago so bought this to continue the story/game. I have windows 7 and was not able to play it with the newer technologies I guess. However I found it from the new owners of the game and downloaded it from their site.
1,Don't buy it - play Myst again,"I'm waiting for Riven since I finished Myst. Although the graphics are fabulous, the game is awful. The puzzles aren't difficult, but sometimes so tricky that the game becomes stupid. Some things just lack sense. If you really liked Myst, don't buy Riven. The only thing you will find both in Myst and Riven is the kind of graphics and the point and click. Don't expect to find the same kind of intelligent puzzles Myst had. After some play, you really get sick of this game. If you really want to play it, borrow from a friend.Riven maybe is the worst game sequel I've seen. It's really sad, because Myst is one of the best games ever."
3,not the strongest in the series but decent,The puzzles are a bit wonky for the most part but keep in line with that special Myst look and feel. Get a walkthrough off the net and you will experience much less frustration at weird oddities that keep you from getting further in the game.
1,I HAVE STARED BOREDOM IN THE FACE!!,"Riven is the unneccessary sequel to Myst. Apparently, there are enough insomniacs out there to merit a sequel. I can't imagine anyone that would prefer this to an excellent game like Red Alert or Quake. If it's reflexes you lack, try Heroes Of Might and Magic 2 or Curse of Monkey Island. Please do not encourage the creators to make yet another sequel."
5,"Challenging, Entertaining, Beautiful!",When I first played MYST I was enthralled by the graphics and enjoyed the game so much that I went into mild depression when I finished it :) But even MYST doesn't hold a candle to RIVEN. Just walking around and looking and listening is entertaining! Everything looks and sounds so realistic that it's utterly fascinating. And it's challenging enough to anybody stuck to their computer with the sound up for great periods of time. I love it!
5,The Best! This is a game that keeps you wanting more.,"Riven is a game that is as maddening as it is fun. This game has so many twists and turns that you really need to take notes just to stay on top of the mystery. You actually participate in the action around you, and getting to the end is a rush the player(you) will never forget."
5,Riven,"Excellent. Sound story line, great graphics and challenging puzzles. Although I found I had to cheat just a little using the Universal Hint System on the Net. All in all it is well worth the purchase."
5,wow.... it's so great,"Riven is one of the most spectacular computer games to come along in a very long time. It's the sequel to Myst, which was a ""got to have"" on everyones' list. This game has mysterious moving rooms, time travel and secret passageways. To be successful requires precise timing and a good memory (or note-taking). As my title says, it's the best thing to come around in a while. So many adventures, so many puzzles and so many traps to steer clear. There's this one part where you..........................................................................., see what I mean. It's so great!!"
4,"Fun game, but sometimes boring","Most of Riven is pretty interesting, but not all of it. Some parts I find boring. They could improve the graphics a bit and mabye put better music in. There are only some songs I like. Most of the songs sound the same. There is no point to those songs."
1,"Pretty to look at, but boring","Can't imagine what all the hoo-ha was about. The scenery is nice, the graphics are lifelike, but so what? The puzzles are pointless and the story is dumb."
3,Very Hard,"I think the game is VERY HARD. To you young people, unless you are really smart and are great at solving puzzles, this is not a game for you. It took me forever just to figure out what was going on and I even had to buy a cheat book to finish the game. I also thought it was a little boring, just a little bit. So, if you want a game with extremely hard puzzles and slightly boring plot, this is your game."
1,Wish I could review it,"Love to be able to review this title, as I loved realMYST so much, but three weeks after purchase game has still not arrived. Extremely disappointed in Amazon and companion retailers."
1,WARNING:IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS XP!!!,WARNING: Holiday season is upon us - The DVD version of this game (RIVEN) as well as its sequals EXILE and MYST do not work with Windows XP especially if you have Quicktime 3.0 or higher. We contacted the company though thier website and they have no intention of upgrading or providing drivers for said games to accomodate users. By their own suggestion at CYAN and RED-ORB and PRESTO is if you have purchased these games and they do not work take them back to the store and see if you can get your money back. Unless the compatibilty with any game produced by this company specifically says it is XP compatible DO NOT PURCHASE IT> Thanks
2,"Riven is bigger but not better. Actually, its awful.","Riven contains the same beautiful details that made Myst such a phenomenon, however it fails to achieve the overall quality of the previous entry in this series. The pacing of puzzles and clues is completely unbalanced. Some of the puzzles are made more difficult by a cavalier attitude toward providing clues. After laboring through puzzle after puzzle, hunting for clue after clue, the finale of the game comes too easily and quickly. Though visually stunning, Riven,in the end, fails to be as entertaining as Myst or many other games currently available."
1,doesn't work with my OSX versioon,When I made the purchase I somehow missed that the software doesn't run with the later versions of OSX.CD case was shattered upon arrival. Didn't bother to return.
1,Issues with playing,I still have not been able to play it. It is not compatible with a lot of computers. Would love if this game was re-made so I could play it
5,This is the Best Game of the Series! (from MYST to End of Ages),"Riven is far and away the best game of the MYST series and for that matter the best game in the first-person adventure genre. The world is very big and the graphics are substantially better than the original MYST. But the best thing is that everything is integrated with the back story and current story. There are no puzzles for the sake of puzzles to go through. Everything has a reason for being, and you get to have the joy of unlocking those reasons.If you only get one of the games from the MYST series, then get RIVEN."
3,Blue States - The Soundings,"Try as they might, Blue States has never quite recaptured the sublimity of their first album, NOTHING CHANGES UNDER THE SUN. Their third album, THE SOUNDINGS, takes a new approach: an emo/electronic combination -- like a more mellow verion of M83. And though it sounds great on ""Across the Wire,"" it sounds too earnest on ""For a Lifetime."" The instrumental ""One Night on Tulane"" has an intriguing electronic feedback to accompany the lovely melody (with some horns to remid us of what made their first album so great), which leads into the folksy vocals ""The Last Blast."" ""Output,"" another instrumental, is as equally haunting. Interestingly enough, the bits of vocals on ""Alright Today"" lend more sonic density than full lyrics elsewhere. But it still doesn't have the emotion of the wordless ""Leaning In."" So even while the album strives for a new paradigm of beauty, it seems that perhaps the older ways were the best."
4,"Give him a break, he didn't find a cure for cancer...","This book was hysterical, it was passed around the office and a good read was had by all. You have to remember that Chuck Barris didn't find a cure for cancer, he created some of the funniest television moments. That being said the book merrily moves along recounting antics from his early days as well as his life in St. Tropez. Lighten up, sit back and enjoy the book."
4,The Game Show King: A Confession,"The guy above didn't read this book....he doesn't even mention the CIA in it.Game Show King was a quick, enjoyable, funny read. I picked it up on a whim and loved it. Chuck's witty, flowing style makes this book read like a group of short stories with a common theme. The stories of the old days in TV are funny, bawdy and enjoyable and leave you wanting more.If you enjoyed his shows, pick up the book, it is worth the read."
4,Diverse soundscape,"Great collection of Acid Jazz/Smooth Jazz Artist that has everything from keyboards, sax, vocals, and vibes. Really cool sounds!"
3,Enjoyable,"I enjoy good children's books and decided to collect the books offered by Madonna. I am from her generation and admire all the things she has done in her life. This 2-disk collection of Madonna reading her books was a great addition to the collection. She adds the spirit and emotional content to the stories she wrote. She could have added a personal note or message or story to add to the content of these CDs. Most of us are unable to get to book signings and readings because we are not close to a big city, this is the next best thing for many. Feel confident in ordering this CD set. Thank you for allowing me to review my purchase."
5,great books madonna,I PURCHASED THESE BOOKS FOR MY DAUGHTER'S CHRISTMAS GIFT.. SHE LOVES THEM AND WE EVEN LISTEN TO THE CD IN THE CAR!
5,on the edge of perfection,"From the opening scene, it is evident you are watching a truly great movie. The story is essentially ""boy interupted"" with a bonus love story but the cast and cinematography are superior. Cillian Murphy is a gifted actor and I look forward to seeing more from him in the future. I highly recommend this movie, eventhough it would have been nice to have more special features since there are very few: bios, production notes and the trailer."
1,Terrible Product,"I can't endorse this product. It seems more like a polish than a cleaner.Like any ""wax"" it is difficult to use and you will see more swirls after you use than you had to begin with.I think it is this anti-static property that causes this. I just want a simple cleaner"
4,Good product,This is a really good product but I have had to use the product more liberally than what the directions call for. After you make your own adjustments I'm sure you will be pleased with this product.
3,Great Screen Cleaner,I use this on my PC monitor all the time. The Iklear Screen Deluxe Cleaning Kit does a great job every time. I would recommend this product without reservation.
1,Spit works better.,"This is the worst cleaning product I have ever tried. I have to unplug my LG flat screen monitor, lay it down flat and work like crazy to get the streaks off. Don't waste you money, find a better product."
4,Bridge Over the River Kwai (Japanese version),"I read this book about a year after I had visited the North of Japan in autumn to walk along Oirase and take a hot bath in one of the hot springs near Mt Hakkoda (both of which are highly recommended). Maybe my view of the area would have been rather different had I read this entertaining but fictionalised account of one of the greatest peacetime military blunders.The book does not really explore the characters (some real, some fiction) in any great depth (nor are they totally convincing) but the factual basis of the story makes one wince with each new act of arrogance and folly as it is exposed in the narrative. The frailties of the major protagonists are ruthlessly revealed in a strictly hierarchical society - a theme explored subsequently by - among others - Chie Nakane."
1,Something wrong,I bought the product 1 month back. Something seems to be wrong..The coating in the bottom of the vessel has already started to give away.. And i could see all the rainbow colours inside the vessel. I donno if it is because i use a electric burner or because of overheating bla bla bla...
4,Great basic function bag,"I really like this bag, but over the last year i have come to realize that i'd be better off with a ""back pack"" type equipment bag due to the amount of stuff i carry. I'm a coach so i carry lots of stuff. But for the price and for just 1 person, i recommend."
5,Nice quality bag,"I haven't really owned a bat bag in a dozen years, so my basis of comparison is pretty weak, but this is a great bag. Good price, good quality, and much better then I expected. The compartments are very convenient, and the zippers seem durable. This bag is also very roomy, but not to the point of being bulky. Couldn't recommend it more for the casual player."
5,Great CD,"The Song RatingsTomorrow-A great song to listen to. 9/10I Love You Not- It has a horrible tune all the way through. 3/10Give It Up- a great song to listen to over and over. 9/10Kiss me,Diss Me- Carries a good tune all the way through. 8/10You're Not Alone- gets boring if you listen to it alot. 7/10I'll Never Fall In Love- The Best Song on the CD. 11/10Second Best- Really bad lyrics 2/10Why won't You Leave Me- it has really good lyrics. 10/10Cannot Stop The World- It carries a good tune. 8/10My Time Alone- It has a good melody. 9/10Waiting on Me- Great Drums and Guitar. 10/10Disaster- A very average song. 5/10Overall Rating 9/10 or 5 stars. Buy this CD"
4,listen to num 12,"ne one else notice that on num 12 (disaster) the lead singer sounds uncannily like blink-182's tom delonge, tell me if im wrong but i think so! ne way this is a cool album and u should spend the lousy 13 bucks to buy it itll give u some catchy tunes to jam to!"
4,Sweeet,"Didnt even know this band even existed until i went to see them supporting something corporate , i was blown away , and bought the album at the show , Homegrown are an awesome band , this cd is brilliant , and they are all pretty nice guys ... this is a TOP CD , and you must slam it into your collection."
4,"Home Grown Rocks, a little messily","Only reason this CD doesn't get 5 stars is because certian songs, like Tomorrow(even though it rocks) has like 16 different parts. It's hard to get into. Then again, songs like You're Not Alone are just unbelievably awesome. I don't really like when John sings. But Kiss Me, Diss Me is awesome."
4,It had to grow on me...,"Having never been a ska-punk fan, I never got the chance to get into Home grown in their earlier years... A friend of mine had burned a whole buncha crap onto a mix CD and was playing it in his car when the song ""I Love you, Not"" came on. It was super catchy and reminded me alot of Mest's ""breakin' down"". I went out and got the CD (along with their EP ""when it all comes down"") and at first I didn't like it. The only other song that truly stuck out was ""disaster"". After a few more listens though, most of the songs stuck and now its hard to pick a favorite. I'd also like to note that the guitarist in ""home grown"" is highly above average for the pop-punk genre, giving guitar lovers something along the lines of SUM 41 meets RUFiO. I'd recommend this album to you if you like: Mest, Blink 182, SUM 41, Allister, RUFiO and maybe even A New Found Glory."
4,They got good...,"I've known Home Grown since they released ""That's Business"", and I always thought they were pretty mediocre and unoriginal. While they may not be creating any groundbreaking music on this album, they have definately grown as a band...This is a great CD, they finally found their niche as the Kings of Pop."
4,Quite comprehensive,Quite comprehensive. More than just the basic though I wish it can go more in-depth. One of the best boxing books I can find so far.
3,"Ulitmate Boxer, wish it was Ulimate book","I train boxers in New York City and am also a boxing historian. I collect boxing manuals and this one is just average, not enough information on how to do techniques. Good for someone just starting out but not for anyone looking for detailed information."
5,Most Knowlegable Book on Olympic-style Boxing,"This is the most knowledgable book ever writtien on Olympic-style (amateur) boxing.The finer points of the game that most people don't even consider, including boxing for judges positioning, computer scoring, five critera for a scoring blow, what to expect as a boxer at a venue, and boxing different styles of boxers are all included. It really shows how boxing is not just getting in the ring and slugging, but a precise and measured art.The self reflection worksheets are also a valuable tool for keeping track of your training progress for both Olympic-style and professional boxers. I look foward to the next book!"
5,How to box - here.,"If you have to get only one book on how to box, this is the one. It has almost all amateur (and some pro) boxing covered. Lots of good exercises, drills, and tactics. The ONLY thing it is lacking in, is pictures - could use more photos for a couple of the techniques."
4,outstanding!,Outstanding puzzle game stimulating and relaxing enjoy the challenge of solving each puzzle in its completion microsoft has produced an outstanding product. These type of puzzles are very hard to come by.
1,Unbelievably bad!!!!!,"UUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I read the reviews before I purchased this game. I CAN""T believe how boring this game is. Puzzles are simple to solve and the story line is cheezy!!! I am a puzzle game addict. This one, unfortunately, will be used as a coaster.!"
1,Must have the CD in the drive,"I detest games like this that require I mount the CD in the drive. Especially when those games are published by companies with big agendas for laptops and other small devices that DON'T HAVE CD DRIVES! And even if I did have a drive, why should I have to go fetch the CD when I want to play the game? HELLO? I might be on the road? Why did I purchase that 60 GB Hard Drive? So that I would keep my stuff in a bunch of CDs? HELLO ??? Or, maybe this game is so overwhelmingly important that I should dedicate my CD drive to it. HELLO?Annoyware? Infuriateware? How about boycottware? The only way to teach companies to stop this infantile attempt at antipiracy is to Not Buy Games That Require the CD in the Drive.Don't buy it unless you want to shuffle CDs every time you want to play it. Don't buy it if your laptop doesn't have a CD drive.I'm not even going to address the quality of the game."
5,"This is the ""holy grail"" of all puzzle games!","This is truly an awesome game. I love how the pictures, music and storyline all blend together while at the same time you are cultured and gain a sense of accomplishment. The best games are those where you learn without realizing it. Bravo, Alexey Pajitnov! (If there was any concern, this game is compatible with Windows XP)"
4,"Great Cable, Great Price","Great Product, much cheaper then Monster and works great. Rec'd in good original packaging. Only issue was it took 2 weeks to receive from Order date."
5,Excellent price!,Great price for this type of cable. Same quality as any you would find in Best Buy or other electronics store.
3,cheaper one available from belkin,There is a cheaper on available from Belkin - 12 foot long and significantly less bought from Amazon !
4,"Works well, excellent price","I've only used it a couple of times (to hook up my laptop to my digital TV - great for instantly watching netflix shows/movies online), but it appears to work well and is much cheaper than products with the same specs sold in stores."
1,Boring,"When I first heard ""Game Over"", I thought Lil' Flip was bringing something new to the table of mainstream rap, but he just proved me wrong with this generic rap-ballad, ""Sunshine"". When it comes to rap-ballads, Lil' Flip is obviously no LL Cool J. The slow-tempo beat and flow doesn't suit Flip, and the bone-headed hook doesn't help the song much either. While Game Over worked for Lil' Flip's style, this does not. He better come back hard with his next single, if he knows what's good for him."
4,Has exactly what I hoped for,I was not disallusioned when i recieved this book. It has a good table of contents the help target a specific topic. Then there are references enough for further research. This is a fundemental personal library book that does not disappoint. Thanks.
4,good reference,"good reference book. Very detailed, you may find it alot to read all at once though. Not an easy read."
5,A must buy!!,This is an amazing book. I must buy for anyone serious about learning more about the catholic faith. The members of catholic answers really hit the nail on the head with this one.
5,Absolute MUST HAVE,"The Essential Catholic Survival Guide is just that - It is a survival guide for questions from anyone who wants to discredit or truly understand more about the Catholic faith. It addresses every topic that a Catholic could be faced with to explain your faith. You will feel confident in giving a solid apologetics response. I highly recommend it, even as a tool to use to defend your faith when Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses knock at your door. You can just show them the pieces that pertain to their attempts to convert you out of the Church by looking it up in the Table of Contents. Addresses everything you need to know, and for more, go to Catholic Answers online to see their faith tracts which contain all of these chapters and more, but you will burn out your printer printing them all. Easier to buy this book!"
1,Quarters do not fit,The quarters do not fit in the book and you either have to bend the book to get them in. Most fall out because they will not fit in the hole completely.
2,This book is a total disappointment,"I ordered the book partly based on the ratings given by others, and I feel they are totally misleading: this book just compiled some basic concepts on ipv6, and of very little value on configuring Cisco IOS practically -- you'd better goggle any specific topic you interested instead."
5,Cross reference for IPV4 and IPV6,"Configuring IPv6 with Cisco IOSI found this book to be excellent reading. It covers enough to help you understand IPv4 and carry that over to IPv6 very adaquately. I have to say I have a technical library of over 300 books and manuals, and this is a welcome addition. It is definitley the best book I've read on IPv6, and know that I will have it around for reference for some time. It is very well written adn organized.I am a proffesional Internet Security Expert, and find this book Configuring IPv6 with Cisco IOS to be very helpful in understanding what to expect in the new version of IP.I recommend the book to anyone who is serious about IT, and wants to be on top of the game."
4,Beware the Giant Carrots,"Just when you think its safe to eat your vegetables, your spaceship is attacked by a giant, disgruntal carrot. Danger Will Robinson! If you are a fan of Lost in Space, you will love these episodes. I actually went looking for these and was quite surprised when I found them. They are a lot of fun to watch and get nostalgic. The quality isn't very good, but it wasn't good when it was on TV. Just sit back and enjoy."
2,Low quality,I love the workout dvd that comes with it - but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses. Very disappointed with this product!
3,Exercise Ball,"The product is good, however it is not the mirrored silver as it appears to be in the picture. It is a dull gray color, which was fine for us."
4,A Trustworthy Pan,"This pan is very responsive and good at delivering sustained heat as a result of the big copper disk on the bottom. My gut reaction is that the performance is better than Sitram Profiserie (aluminum disk) but I don't have two same-size pans to test with.I can compare performance with my Calphalon One sauté pan, whose performance is much inferior. My Calphalon pan, which sells for much more, got bumped to the basement.The only negative is that the handle, which appears designed to provide a sure grip when the pan is picked up using a side towel, is the most uncomfortable of any pan I own.I have purchased one or two pieces over the years of most of the brands you've heard and can tell you from experience that Sitram provides the best value."
4,Puzzle Enthusiast,This puzzle is of a really neat picture. It is definately a difficult puzzle for any jigsaw puzzle pro. The details are really hard to spot in the puzzle.
4,Jake from Naples,"Usually I'm not into this type of music. Hey! I danced to Glenn Miller in my salad days. But, a friend gave me this CD as a gift, now I'm hooked. The finest keyboard I've heard, and great vocals. I'll buy their next one."
3,narrow across toe,"These skates are cute, look nice. I had to return them, they are very narrow across the toes. If you have a wide foot at all, I would not recommend them"
2,Good enough to take my daughter skating,"I wanted skates to go skating with my daughter, but didn't want to invest a lot since I don't know how long her roller skating kick will last. I found these skates to run narrow, and I do not have a wide foot. I wear a 7 in skates and the length of the footbed was good, just the width is a problem. They are also stiff and I felt the ankle area was too thick and bulky. I would have sent them back but the return shipping was too much, it wouldn't have been worth it. I guess I should have just spent the extra money and got ones I could have tried on before buying."
5,Nice skates,My daughter loves her skates! They fit great! They are comfortable and easy to put on! Nice skates! Thank you!
2,Very uncomfortable..I sent them back.,They were really cute and durable and arrived quick.However they were really tight and felt like metal was poking my toes and my heel I couldnt even stand up in them let alone skate...the boot part leans against the back of your calf instead of just standing straight up.Hard to explain but very uncomfortable.I sent them back and ordered another brand...
3,they r great skates but the size,"Well ordered 4 pair of these skates for my God daughters and a pair for my niece. Sizes ordered 2 pair of 10.,9,and 6. The 10s were true to size and the 9. But the 6 was not. I had to send it back and re-order in one size up. The problem with these skates is they get really small and tight towards the toes not for wide feet individuals but narrow feet. They skate well and r made for hard play."
3,Beware the plastic!,"The eyelets and lace hooks are plastic, so these are NOT durable skates. I bought them for 60% off, so I'm not upset; just annoyed. The trucks underneath are plastic, too. ok for a few session, but not durable for the long run. :{"
2,you get what you pay for.,I was pleased with these until 3 weeks later when the entire skate fell apart. Not happy that my daughter is in tears because her skates fell apart so quickly. You get what you pay for. Cheap skates cheap quality
2,"Attractive, but NARROW and VERY STIFF!!!","The seller describes this skate boot as soft Nubuck, but this skate is not in the least bit soft! It's very stiff, narrow, and has very little cushion in the insole. I'm sorry I purchased this skate!"
2,Skates are not comfortable,"These are good looking, but they really hurt the back of my leg. I thought I would need something with ankle support so I got a little higher ones. I couldn't even skate with them for 5 minutes. Very stiff and would have to break in a little at a time maybe. Or maybe they just aren't built right??? We'll see."
3,consequence of frugality,Im not impressed with these skates ...they are heavy and uncomfortable ...the wheels are cool but ...design on the boot make it hard to airbrush. Now I ended up spending more money because I ended up purchasing the Chicago skates after all...smh
4,they seem pretty,"my daughter is skating every friday at the rink across the street, she will love these when I give them to her on Christmas morning."
1,size question,I need a 9.5 W should I get a ten? I am learning to roller skate all over again for excersize and can't wait to see how these look. I really like the poms too.
4,tasty fun,"When you go to the store and purchase yourself a pack of sugary bubble gum, you, undoubtedly will leave with certain expectations. You want soft, pink, give-me-a-cavity kind of satisfaction. Dressy Bessy is that gum, and they are delicious. Their classic pop is so catchy it's almost annoying. Almost. Now, if you want something more substantial than candy-coated rock, keep shopping."
4,How Twee can you be?,"A great follow up from this Kindercore band. The usual Jangly guitars, off key-n'-kilter vocals, with a 60's bubblegum-via-Velvets influence. Perhaps a bit too clever for it's own good sometimes - but, well that's twee for you."
2,not what I ordered,"When I ordered this chutney, it was supposed to be ""Sun"" brand, where mangoes were the first ingredient. What I was sent was ""Patak"" brand, where sugar is the first ingredient, and which is quite sweet for a chutney. I don't feel I got what I ordered. I have bought Patak brand in the past and didn't like it much."
2,"Not very good, don't waste your money, D-","This book isn't very good for the repair of Firebirds and Trans Am. It has very limited Info; the water pump section shows a small block Chevy. There is nothing about the Pontiac water pump. It has a few wiring Schematics. It is just not very good or detailed. This book doesn't show any Schematics with gauges or ""Gauge Pack"" only idiot lights. I would not recommend this Manual for anything but a novelty gift. Spend the extra money and purchase a GM Book/Manual. I also purchased the Clymer book and it is worse. No schematics at all and almost all pictures are of small block Chevy. Just about a complete waste of money!!!!! I am very disappointed in both of these manuals."
1,The starter guide of Fusion is better than this book,"Do you need a manual duplicated? then buy this book. But the manual are better. The program is great and this book don't add nothing new. Nothing about the SDK for build NFX components, nothing a bout how to implementate hava applets,... A child can learn in Fusion by him self all included in this book"
2,You need a lot of concentration and patience to read it.,"I don't have any background in HTML. But I want to build a web site using Netobjects. The authors provide very little explanation in the beginning to keep me in sync with the technical terms and names used in Netobjects. Many examples are shown without any real explanation. Some major functionality of Netobjects like Link, Anchor are not covered in the book. The authors try to make easy thing complicated. Netobjects is very easy to do. Your friend who knows Netobjects can tell you how within an hour. But even though you finish reading this book, you don't know that much. I almost helplessly cried when I was trying to understand what the authors meant"
1,Not worth the money,"I've got other Laura Lemay books so I thought this one would be as good but it's not. It was written by others and her name is just on the cover. [Bad idea, Laura. It hurts your credibility.]"
3,Quite shallow book now offered FREE by NetObject Fusion,"Shallow read not adding much to the manual. NetObjects Fusion offered this book FREE to all users who paid the full price when they dramatically (and drastically) cut the price of their product. A generous ""sop"" or cynical ""marketing ploy? The jury is still out..."
1,THIS IS A TERRIBLE TAPE,This is a terrible tape..The tape is just about unwatchable...The quality is such that you can hardly make out the characters...The tape looks like it has been copied too many times...The sound quality isn't much either...i'm suprised that Amazon would sell something of this poor quality
1,Tape and sound quality are dreadful.,"Like another reviewer, I am astonished that Amazon would market such a poor quality product. Better to do without than to suffer through this miserable video. I should have returned this product for a refund, but figured once I had opened and viewed same, it was a lost cause. Seems hard to believe that there is no better alternative to this shockingly terrible video. After viewing this, you can certainly identify with poor Dr. Faust, for you have been through Hell."
2,this wasn't the faust I expected!!!!,"Although the quality of the tape (audio and video) was not completely horrendous, the conspicuous absence of english subtitles made it an indeed awkward viewing experience for me, a non-speaker of French. The quality of the production was, in my opinion, very nice. The sets and costumes were lavish, and the singing was exemplary. However, the characterization of Marguerite as a Catholic nun made it very strange to say the least. Also, during the overture a bizarre ballet is performed in which Faust uses Universal Studios-ish Frankenstein equipment to bring a dead girl back to life for a few moments. Also disappointing was the omission of the Walpurgis night scene of the opera. I guess we'll just have to wait for Kultur video to put out a nice version of this opera on tape!!"
1,Total disaster,"As noted by others, this video does not feature Freni,Ghiaurov, or Domingo, nor is it from the Opera de Paris. It is sung by Alfredo Kraus and others with a regional Italian opera company (Parma, if I remember correctly). I bought this video hoping for a professional production. What a mistake! The video appears to have been shot from the balcony with a hand held VCR. The initial scene concentrates on the trap door through which Mephistofeles appears. The video is blurry and focuses much of the time on an empty stage or on the bass players in the orchestra. The voices are decent, but can hardly be heard, while the orchestra (which is not outstanding) dominates the audio. The few titles are hand written in Italian. Don't even THINK of buying this tape."
5,RugRats Print Shop,"My husband loves using this easy to make program. He makes collages, cards, etc. all with this handy little program. The item was received lightening fast and in great condition. I would definitely recommend this seller and this program to everyone."
2,Way too much money for what it does.,"Does a fair job printing documents from Palm Docs to Go, if you print from inside Docs to Go. Also I found I needed PrintBoy or some other Palm application to use this printer at all. The Bluetooth feature is an improvement over the earlier IR-only model, and I don't mind that it only uses A7 size thermal paper. But the Palm OS itself doesn't support printing Docs to Go fonts, so what you see on your Palm device is not what you get from the printer. Also no graphics printing, but again, that's a Palm OS problem. Other than that, it's a pretty amazing little device, but not worth half of what it costs."
3,BE CAREFUL!,"I ordered this book based on the ""look inside."" On-line there were pictures instead of words throughout so a child could ""read"" along. The book I received only has words-no helpful pictures. A child who can not read, can't ""help."""
5,This Sitram Stainless Steel Saucepan is an outstanding pan!,"This saucepan is an absolutely outstanding pan. I own it and use it everyday with NO problems. The size is very useful. The pan has a thick copper core sandwiched between layers of stainless steel and is very responsive to temperature changes. Cleaning the pan is a snap in the dishwasher. If by chance something sticks, a little soak with hot, soapy water first does the trick.Sitram Catering Stainless Steel pans are extremely high quality pans. They are used by professional cooks in France who do not put up with inferior equipment.I own a number of pans from the Catering line and heartily recommend them all. I like this pan so much and find it so useful that I just bought a second pan of this size.1/16/08 Update: I do wish the prices on the Catering line had not risen as much as they have. The prices are on par when compared to other high quality lines but the prices are no longer the great deal they used to be."
5,The ties that bind,"Eve Bunting has a wonderful gift of capturing the meaning of life for children young and old. She is truly a master storyteller.I love this book and give it frequently as a gift. It is a perfect way to remind the receiver of the ties that bind and cross all barriers of language and distance.After the devastation of her village in World War II, my Mother planted an almond grove in the hills of her village in Greece where she was born. I promised her that I would visit her grove one day. When I did, I felt a connection and less heart ache, now that she is no longer with us. I now know she comes alive every spring when the blossoms perfume the air in Vitoli.This is a book that is not just for Greeks, but for all grandparents to show the ties that bind (even when they are no longer with us).Owen & Mzee: The True Story Of A Remarkable Friendship"
2,Please....,"I could have written a FAR more scandalous book, and if I do I'll be sure and ""name names"". And as far as the reviewer who thinks this stuff didn't/doesn't happen at the 'Big wire-houses' ? Wake up!!! It goes sooo much deeper than the author even touched on."
3,"Interesting, but...","I found this book an interesting read, but rather confusing. As a broker for 15 years, I can verify alot of what this guy did. I'm also pretty sure I can identify the real names of ""Harvard"", ""junior College"" and ""prep school"". However, he makes a number of factual errors, which makes me wonder if this ""former broker"" is really what he says he is.An overall entertaining read, but anyone who thinks all brokers are like this is just plain wrong."
5,CASH RICH,"THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ. I TOOK THE BOOK ON VACATION AND REALLY COULD'NT PUT IT DOWN. IM USUALLY NOT A DILLIGENT READER BUT THIS BOOK REALLY HELD MY INTEREST. I MISS IT NOW THAT IM FINISHED WITH IT. ANYONE WHO TRADES STOCKS OR LIKES THE STOCKMARKET, SHOULD LOVE THIS BOOK!"
3,Good information,"This book reveals a lot about a small part of the industry i.e. underwriting and selling micro-cap stocks. I don't think it accurately portrays the market in blue chips and medium cap stocks. People with the discretionary income/wealth to gamble (not invest) in microcaps know what they're getting into and don't need a lot of protection. The authors make clear repeatedly that clients are ""pre-qualified"" and have sufficent resources to play the game. The authors also try to portray making a market in a stock as a necessarily bad thing. I think market making is a legitimate activity if the float is sufficiently large because it adds liquidity to the market. All that said, I was still astonished to learn that there are such lowlifes in the microcap market."
2,Mediocre at Best,"Having been a broker for the past 13 years, I had high hopes for this, yet was dissappointed. I have worked for major wire houses, (Shearson-Lehman Bros,eg,) and little OTC houses and I can say honestly that I could have written a MUCH better book ! ""Anonymous"" failed to mention that what he spoke of is only a small sector of the business. The investing public only thinks they ""don't need brokers"" because we are in a raging bull market. What about when this ends? We are NOT all scam artists, and I know how to make $$ for my clients when its not easy."
4,"Dell C8882 Inspiron 17"" Laptop Backpack",This backpack looks really nice and is lightweight.I think that it would have been nice if the shape wasa little more square on the bottom. All of the contents end upsquished together at the bottom of the bag even if they are inseperate pockets making it hard to get at them quickly.
2,An extra copy of instruction manual.,All the strategy in this book is very logic. Something that you will do even if you don't buy this book. I bought this book and play the game without reading it. I stuck only in 2 ocassion and this book help.All other information is the same with the book that come with the game.
2,waste of money,"If u wanna waste ur time n money u should definitely buy this guide, if not u r better off with the game manual."
4,Good product; good price;,Good product; good price; like that it has a felt soles but also has rubber sole sections at toe/heel ends of shoe.
2,BORING,"I have not warmed up to this book yet, haven't even finished it because it is not holding my attention. Character development is flat, the main characters don't even know each well and yet they are jumping right into bed, etc. I bought both books 1 and 2 for this series because they sounded interesting, but I'm not so sure I will enjoy either one. If the book ends up better in the end I will adjust my review."
3,Couldn't put it down,Kept my attention. I didn't expect some of the twists and turns. Couldn't put it down. The characters were relatable and fun.
2,Not for Me.,This book is written for technical people. The overall tone is dull and pedantic. The contents will be difficult to follow for those who do not have mathematical or programming background.Anyone who has an overall understanding of the EMV specifications will have very little use for the material in this book. There is nothing of note with respect to specific card schemes.Business people can get much of the non-technical information in the book for free from other sources.
1,"No rivets, just inadequate spot welds on handle","It's big. I bought the comercial lid too. Unfortunately, neither handle is riveted to the pan. The long handle broke completely off during shipping even though the box that it came in was still in good shape. The spot welds were inadequate (downright crummy).Pans without rivets are a bit easier to clean, so I figured I give this pan a try instead of an All-Clad. If the spotwelds had been up to par, I would happier.Amazon was quick to send a shipping tag for both the pan and lid. Amazon quickly refunded everything including shipping."
1,wrong picture,"I have bought 6 Sitram kitchenware from Amazon during the last 5 years, because of the high quality construction and tubular handle, as pictured..I returned this last product because although the Amazon picture is unchanged,, the product is being made quite differently, with a very uncomfortable flat handle. I believe Sitram has been bought by another company."
5,Now you're cooking with copper.,"This copper-bottomed Catering line by Sitram is the best performing line of cookware around. I have an All-Clad SS skillet that is almost exactly this size and my wife and I both like this Sitram pan quite a bit more than the AC. The thick (~2 mm) copper disc in the bottom of the this pan means that it heats much more quickly and evenly than an aluminum clad pan like AC. When you remove this pan from the heat it cools quickly, too, meaning food stops cooking when you want it too. Also, its quite easy to clean up, probably because the stainless interior seems to be a lot more smooth than in other pans. If you cook often enough to be considering a pan in this price range, just get it. You'll love copper the first time you use it!"
3,Nothing Special,"I recently received this software and find it to be similar to several other drawing programs that are available for free online. I suppose that this would be a good purchase for a child who absolutely loves drawing on the computer, but a child who is only occasionally interested in drawing programs, just stick to what's available for free online.I would also like to add that if you purchase this product from ccsoftare (as I did), do not expect to receive a newly packaged product. Instead, you may (as I did) receive just a CD-Rom in a paper envelope. Amazon's Condition Guidelines specifically state that any software being sold as ""New"" must come in an unopened package with a UPC symbol. This seller not only ignored this guideline, but was offensively flippant in his/her response to my negative review. I would not reccommend doing business with this seller."
1,Don't buy this book!,"First of all, I found multiple errors---answers that were marked differently in the answer key than in the explanations, a key paragraph missing in one of the reading selections, questions based on a highlighted section with no highlighting visible! Second of all, if this was your only preparation material for the test, it would scare you silly! This book tests at a much higher level than the actual test. Buy the very expensive guides from the ETS, they're shorter but much more accurate and indicative of the difficulty of the actual test."
1,The book suffers from poor editing.,"The book suffers from poor editing but the content review seems good. I have found many glaring incorrect answers and misprints. Example 1) pg. 84, question 91. The answer is November, but it could also be October. Example 2) pg. 192, The ""Reading About Reading"" paragraph appears twice on the same page. 3) pg. 196, under ""Author's Tone"" the book spells impassioned as 'innpassioned', on the CBT practice test - half of the answers in the back for a particular passage are referring to a passage not in the book! These were just the errors I remember, too. Also, you can't use a calculator on the CBT even though the book says you can, although the testing center said this is a recent Praxis regulation. It's too bad the book had so many errors. Who has time to question their study materials?"
1,Rubbish,"I bought this translator for $99. Not from Amazon but from the Lec Power Translator website. Do not purchase this item it is rubbish. I had an email from a Spanish friend which I translated both on this product and Google translator. The free Google translation was far superior. A simple Spanish word ""Ano"", meaning year, was translated as ""Anus"".It wasn't just that but the email came out as gibberish in certain sections whereas Google translated it fine.Very, very disappointing."
2,A Real Challange,"I am not really a fan of this type of puzzle, while the end result looks good the effort expended is high. The only part of this puzzle that you can complete without refering to the box is the edge. For the rest of the puzzle you will spend hours comparing a particular piece with the small picture on the box looking for its position. Each puzzle piece has a portion of 4 small pictures on it, the colour and picture content do not indicate where it fits in the overall jigsaw. Be prepared for hours of squinting and a sore neck as you repetitivly search the picture. If you are a fan of this range of puzzles then this puzzle carries on the quality and style."
4,The Candy Book No.15 by Ruth Berolzheimer,"250 recipes the sweetest story ever told! Everything you need to know about making fondant candies, chocolate candies, fudges, caramels, divinities and nougats and so much more"
5,cute book!,"We don't celebrate Halloween, but I find it really hard for my 5 and 7yr old to understand. We know lots of christians that do celebrate it, which can make our decision ever harder. It is hard for them to always be ""missing out""! This book helped them to understand how Halloween began. It was very educational for me! We want to teach all things to the Glory of God and as a mom I fall short in so many ways. I am glad to find a book that helps them to understand why we choose to different and that it isn't something they are ""MISSING"" out on!"
1,Great for Crazy Christians,"This book is a helpful tool in raising children to be right-wing religious whack jobs that the majority of the country cannot stand. One thing not addressed in this book is how Halloween is satanic and ""dark-sided"" but celebrating Christmas (complete with a tree, a clear holdover from pagan religion) is ok. The author may want to write a follow-up book explaining that discrepancy."
1,Shameful,"Halloween is CULTURAL, NOT religious. The Celts, Druids, and Pagans knew nothing of Christianity before they converted to it; they were doing what they could in a harsh world and these festivals were their comfort and joy.Sitting back, at home, being smug as they watch the trick-or-treaters, thinking that they are better and ""holier"" than those out, those children are being bigoted, not better.I expected some of the true, realistic dangers of Halloween, such as too-dark costuming or unwrapped candy and such, and I find this book to be abhorrant.Also, there seems to be that obnoxious message about the ""Celtic Lord of Death, Samhain"". There was no Celtic lord of death. Samhain(SAW-wen), meaning ""Summer's End"", was the Celtic New Year, a period between the end of the old year and the beginning of the new year.I am growing more distrustful of Christianity, and this helped push me further away."
1,Generic alt-country not worth your time,"I'm told this is Philly-based singer-songwriter James Oliver's third CD, and if that is the case, I never want to hear the other two CD's. Truth be told, there's little that stands out here. The stab at white reggae (""This State of Youth"") is incredibly ill-advised, as is the inept attempt at psychedelia (""You Rip Up Your Postcard""). Vocally, Oliver has serious problems with pitch - he's not a quality non-singer like Lou Reed or Tom Waits, just someone who should seriously consider investing in a pitch-corrector. Lyrically, he's trying for a ""...Memphis Blues""-era Dylan poetic surrealism, and failing miserably, as, even with a lyric sheet enclosed, I can't figure out what any of the songs are about. You may end up buying this to support local Philly music, but that doesn't mean you'll listen to it more than once."
2,Huge sections of the book were missing!,"I give this two stars because the parts of the book that were actually _there_ were really good. Unfortunately huge sections weren't included in the book! It's missing at least pages 15-46, 79-134, 199-230, 295-342, and 455-526, possibly more that I haven't spotted. That's a full 40% of the book gone!!! Trying to get a refund now..."
2,No good,"Very disappointing. I ordered some of these and while they look pretty snazzy at first glance, they are very poorly made. Some had weird spots of tarnish I couldn't buff out. In a few of them, the piece that holds the cigarettes in place was actually backwards and upside down. And they all make a terrible clicking noise when you open them. Trying to be inconspicuous over here.I dress flasks up to resell them, but I would feel terrible reselling these. I guess I'll have to pawn them off on my friends..."
5,"Entertaining, provocative, and inspired","From start to end this novel had me. A provocative and witty coming of age story told from inside the mind of a boy growing up in a screwed up family under the tyranny of a very messed up father. Unthinkable thoughts makes you think and makes you smile.And yes, it is the type of book that would be enjoyed by someone who loved Running With Scissors."
4,How Old Are You?,"I bought this book whe I was in 7th grade because it was in the recommend list that I got from a local newspaper. Well, I thought that it had some mature content to be included in a middle school book list.Although it is a pretty nice book in whole, it has lots of sexual references tht one may not recommend to a twelve-year old."
1,UNTHINKABLE THOUGHTS,"i did not care for this one. though it gave me further insight and appreciation into the jewish religion, i kept wondering if i had to be jewish... or male... to appreciate the humor. a strict father thrusts his desires upon his two sons, and neither share the father's dreams.i found the book to be much more stressful than it was entertaining. i suppose someone who liked this book would also appreciate the humor in RUNNING WITH SCISSORS."
3,An almost-coming-of-age story,"This almost-coming-of-age story follows Jacob Green's life from age 10 through 15 as he attempts to deal with his learning disabilities and his dysfunctional, Orthodox Jewish family in 1970's suburban New Jersey. Jacob idolizes his older brother Asher, an artistic rebel, but is scared to death of his tyrannical father. His mother is so busy trying to escape her life that she has almost no presence in her son's life. Jacob expresses himself well, especially in his thank you notes for his Bar Mitzvah gifts and his letters to Meagan, the babysitter whose seductive ways leave a lasting impression on Jacob in this funny yet poignant novel. Probably deserves 3 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't give that option."
2,"Not ""This Boy's Life""","A thin buildensroman centered on the adolescent Jacob Green, ADHD, sex-obsessed son and brother. Jacob idolizes his artistic older brother, Asher, the family rebel. He is tyrannized by his autocratic and narcissistic father, Abram. And his converted from gentile mother, Claire, remains ineffective in his life, even after she leaves her husband whose iron-fisted emotional abuse is unbearable for everyone. Funny in spots, tense with suppressed violence, and hackneyed in being another story of male repression couched in a father-son relationship.Tobias Wolff'sThis Boy's Life: A Memoiris afar better literary experience and vastly outshines Braff's offering, which reads more like a screenplay than a novel. Gee, I wonder why?"
4,Jacob Green's adolescence fumblings amusing,"I started this book but really couldn't get into it at first. I came back to it a few weeks later and found myself much more interested so it may have just been my mood at the time.This is definently a light read, for me at least, but enjoyable. I don't know much the Jewish religion but as for good story telling it seems quite interesting.His elder brother doesn't seem the greatest person to idolize though. But I suppose someone who is living in a strict and rigerous household, they might long for freedom, especially that of their family members.It was a sweet book at times too, as he fumbles through adolescence, learning about vaiours things. I also felt bad about the constant mockery and frustration his father exhibited towards him due to his learning disability.Joshua Braff is an interesting author and this book managed to hold my attention the second time around."
2,The Dissident,"I'm surprised to find that mine is one of the only negative reviews. As a religious Jew, I found it hard to recognize Judaism, as portrayed by Braff. I truly hope that these inconsistencies are the product of Braff's active imagination and that this novel does not reflect Braff's experiences as a Jew -- or his experiences with Orthodox Jews."
2,Very Disappointing,We were very disappointed with this game. Its basically a read-along story combined with a few games. My preschoolers were bored with this one right away. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,A Better Book Exists,"How can the jacket flap state that this book is to be the seminal book on Tashas's life and work when such a work already exists in the fine bibliography book, a work of true scholarship entitled Tasha Tudor, The Direction of Her Dreams by John and Jill Hare.The Davis book is a disappointment with many illustrations taken from her newer books and works . I had hoped to see as yet unpublished works of Tasha's art from the past.....old Christmas cards etc...."
4,"""Kilar strikes a cord setting the mood""","Silva Screen presents a fascinating soundtrack composed by Wojciech Kilar - THE NINTH GATE, a Roman Polanski film. Kilar who also composed ""Francis Ford Coppola's - Bram Stoker's DRACULA"" - was a triumph. Ninth Gate's score is eerie, suspenseful and haunting, much to the listeners enjoyment. Kilar strikes a cord when setting the mood for this film, which never stops from beginning to end. A beautiful voice emerges from soprano Sumijo, blending well with - The City of Prague Philharmonic & Chorus, conducted by Stepan Konicek. Please stand up and take a bow, all those who participated in this venture through the - NINTH GATE!Total Time: 54:07 on 16 Tracks/ Silva Screen Records - SSD 1103 (2000)"
1,misrepresented,"These are really mini. They must be intended for a toy oven set. I received them as a gift, both the giver and I thought they would be individual serving size, but they are hardly bite size. I can't think of any practical use. Amazon should list the size prominently in the catalog."
1,The add need correcting.,I did before I saw this Review. I work in Egypt for 30 days at a time and thought I was buying something nice from the add online but when my wife got them in the mail she asked why I got them. I told her to look at the add to see if they shipped the right item. After looking at the add the add makes them look like large dishes but short but the no so. The add is way off. They are so small they could be used as a shot glass if you need a drink after buying them.
1,Good sound terrible design flaws,Sound is fine. The volume is also a push button for differnt sound settings so if you are driving and bump this button as your are turning the volume you will switch to settings and it is a pain to get back. It claims to read mp3 disks but I have had no luck and lots of TOC ERROR messages whenever i put in an MP3 disk and have tried various different ways of burning these cd's with no luck. Skip this device.
3,"good value, great sound","I was looking for a no frills MP3 player with an easy-access jack on the front plate to plug my Ipod into. This was a great deal at 6ave Electronics, 30% less than Best Buy! The sound is excellent, but the controls are a bit awkward and you can't see the button functions at night (kind of hard to read in the daytime too), but I'll memorize them soon enough. If you like to save gas by crankin' up the bass this unit has a separate subwoofer jack and two bass boost settings. Rock on!"
3,Functional Device,Just installed the unit into my 1994 Pontiac Bonneville today - I agree that the joystick control is quite the cause of frustration. Even in the fifteen hours I've had it in my car I have had trouble using some of the features. The auxiliary input is perfect for me and provides much clearer sound than a tape-deck adapter ever could. The unit gives great sound and once it is set up works perfectly as it should. The only issue with the product is changing your options and viewing information on-the-fly (while driving). Looking over at the unit to try and control the small joystick is quite the dangerous task when driving your vehicle.
3,Within Me,"Lorna's approach to this album is quite different from any other freshman album I have ever listen too. Never has anyone released an album with so many different styles of singing. This album starts with the flavor of a Vanessa Rubin ,takes you to a little Chante Moore, and delivers Dianne in style. Lorna has a wonderful voice. I'm looking forward to her next album."
3,Earsnuff,"I used the Bilsom Leightning L3 Earmuff when I was in Japan hunting dolphins in the sea. Since they use a harpoon gun, it's a good idea to have Earmuffs and nose tarpins. Has cheap plastic, so it won't last if you use it for wrestling near an airport or car work. It can break easy if you work in a slaughterhouse or a tub plant. I also found that it squeezes one's brain if you leave it on for 5 days."
1,These do NOT work,"These barely block noise traffic noise in my apartment. Foam ear plugs work better, and Nexcare ear plugs work 10 times better. They refunded my money, but not the shipping charges."
5,"Super comfortable, economical, and most importantly, great function!","We have two pair of these beauties at the telescope array I observe with to wear when checking our (unbelievably loud) power generators. They work so well we have to gesture in ridiculous fashion to one another to communicate effectively while wearing them.I bought a pair for my dad for Father's Day this year to wear around the property for yard work. His hearing is very sensitive to loud noises, so he always wears muffs for mowing, trimming, and using the chainsaw. After using them just once he was extremely pleased with both the feel and the noise reduction - far and away better than anything he had been using previously.Highly recommended, especially for the price!"
3,Block out office noise perfectly!,"I purchased these headphones to block out office noise. I sit around people that sniff, cough, constantly clear their throats, and make other bodily noises that I just don't care to hear. Since our new office has very low walls, now, conversations are overheard as well. These headphones block out just about everything but the very loud talk around me. They at least reduce it to a level that I can still work without wanting to yell out, ""BLOW YOUR DAMN NOSE."" or ""SHUT THE HELL UP!""However, if you need complete silence, wear foam plugs AND these headphones! That will block out even the loudest talker or a crowd that congreates around your office to chat.I gave them three stars because they are very, very snug on my head. Although, I'd rather have them that way, than too loose."
3,"Great for noise, but...","These work great for noise cancellation, but so do many other muffs. I bought these to get a high comfort level which I did not get on long term wearing. After about an hour I need a break from the pressure. Just for the record I wear a size 7 1/8 hat."
5,Awesome earmuffs!,Love these earmufs! I use them almost everyday as an adult student who needs quiet to study. I take them with me to the library etc. to drown out the noise of chatter and clicking keyboards. I also gave them as a gift to someone who complained of the loud noise of the ride-on lawn mower. These worked like a charm! So much so that a second pair was requested. Every place I go people ask me where they can buy these too b/c they are so envious. I tried every kind of earmuff and ear plug before I found these and they are truly the best.
5,Quiet,I use these at the gun range. They do an excellent job at keeping the noise to a minimum. They are also very comfortable to wear for an extended amount of time.
4,Bilsom Earmuff,"I use the Bilsom Leightning L3 Earmuff on our Kubota ZD-21 diesel grass mower. The earmuff is the best of several brands that I have used over the past twenty years, and is better than previous Bilsom models that I used. The quality is in the sound protection provided with an NRR of 31. I can easily detect the superior sound protection over the previous NRR 29 Bilsom that this model replaces. High sound protection is supremely important for anyone who is exposed to high noise levels for extended times.I agree that the earmuff is slightly fragile. That may be the price of an acceptable weight and it is a secondary consideration for my use since I can avoid physical maltreatment. For my use, the earmuff has never failed me. Sound protection is not very costly. I've been using earmuffs for many years and know of no superior earmuff at any price."
3,Not for a big head,"My hat size is Large, I found this earmuff small. Even when fully extened, the headband still press top of my head hard, or my earlobes crushed by the ear cushions.Decent build quality, good sound insulation, too bad it doesn't fit."
4,They do the job!,"I have two of these, one for my gal and one for me. They fit well and perform the intended task as well as you can imagine. If I have a complaint it would be that on hot summer days they can be uncomfortable, but any full-size muff would be, so we use these in cooler weather and plugs when the temps are 90 and above. In my experience, Leightning products are well made and always a good value. I have other Leightning products and am equally happy with them."
3,Be Careful with Eczema,"The mask does clean the skin, but if the skin is broken due to eczema be careful because it burns!! In combination with Eucerin cream it seems to work."
5,Giftgiftgift!!,I got this for my mom along with the Sea Salt oil scrub and loves them both!!!! And I used some too and its very tingly. ;]
3,Hummingbird Fish Finder is just okay,I thought this product would be very cool but it really isn't. It is really pretty hard to read because of the small display. Also since it floats all the time it is hard to keep it from constantly washing back toward you if fishing in a lake. River fishing is about impossible because the current makes the sonar not read properly. Overal it is a great idea but not the best product.
1,you get what you pay for,"Use this as a supplement only. I tried to do all my studying with this book, and did not feel prepared at all(I did pass though. It doesn't have very much information about bouy markings and lights. It is merely a gloss over of the subject material. THere's a reason the proper study guide is two massive volumes. Unless you have prepared in other ways, (courses or the actual books) this is a study guide at best."
5,Sweet and straight to the heart!,"Cracking the Parenting Code: 6 Clues to Solving the Mystery of Meeting Your Child's NeedsThis book makes me sigh...in a great way! It brings me back to the real sweet issues in life, beautifully written and very insightful. Our small group did a study and the verdict was unanimous: five stars all around as it brought us all such peace and joy!"
1,"Been there, bought the book","While Ruth Haley Barton uses the right Christian terminology, the underlying practice of this book is Zen Meditation. I would read this book with a great deal of caution."
1,very dissapointed,Wow! Who sells outdated software? Seriously? My old XP computer that we have had for 12 years won't even run this program. What a waste of money and time! I wish I had looked at the reviews before I put this item in my cart.
1,Windows Requirements,My kids never played the game. This CD-Rom requires Windows 95/98. We don't have ANYthing that runs such an outdated version of Windows. Know the requirements BEFORE you buy this!
5,SO glad I bought this!,"I bought my D40X from a vendor through amazon and added the extended warranty as I checked out. I never thought I would need it. Exactly 1 month after the Nikon warranty expired, the auto focus lens stopped working. I just called the number and sent it off by UPS. It was quickly repaired and returned working well until a year later when the flash stopped working too. Sent off and fixed immediately. The cost of one of these repairs more than pays for the warranty. I still have 2 years left and hopefully won't need it, but am glad to have it just in case. I don't know why these others are giving low ratings when they never even used the service. It does not make any sense to give an opinion on something they have no experience on.The staff I spoke to on the phone were very quick to answer calls, take my info and send the pre-paid shipping labels. Good experience all around."
3,Warranty,Took a while for the Warranty to come in... About 3 weeks delay...Plan is cheaper than most other online company offer... Time will tell how good the service will be
3,4 Yr Service Plan,"Hope I never have to use it, won't know how good a plan this is until then! Without using it I rate it a 3."
4,Great books for discussion and awareness,"We all enjoy these books. My daughter is not yet two but she loves Ann Morris' entire series of books and likes to identify things in each photograph. The photos are obviously dated but I don't believe that lessens the impact of what the author and photographer are trying to do.As she grows, we'll continue to read these books, moving on from identifying simple items to talking about cultures, traditions, environments, geography, socio-economics, and etc. In the final pages of each Ann Morris book there are maps and descriptions of locations/subjectss for each page that allow readers to discuss where places are in relation to one another and what is really happening in photos versus what a young child (or adult!) might imagine is happening.I recommend these books for curious children starting at age 18 months and all the way up into the school years."
5,Work great. Dr. recommended. Packs of all 1 size ARE available,My doctor recommended these and they are great.Packages of just one of the 3 sizes are available if you know which one you prefer. Try Amazon or the pedifix website or printed catalog. 1-800-PEDIFIX
2,Comfy but...,"These toe separators are quite soft and comfy, but they won't stay in place, even with socks worn over them. And I can't see any change in the direction of my overlapping toes. Overall, I wasted my money unless you count satisfying my curiosity."
4,toes,These are terrific. They really work and do the job right. They are washable and may be used many times. I rate them very highly.Hope others will try them
1,Pedifix 3 layer toe Separator,"Just foam cut into shapes. Something one can do for themselves. Was cheap, but not even worth that price.Don't bother."
5,Uvex Melanin Polorized Sunglasses,"These are an awsome set of sunglasses for driving, they are somewhat stylish but are an excellent product really does reduce glare and I guess Melanin is good for your eyes too. But I love these pair of sunglasses I hope I never lose them. Worth every penny I paid for it"
1,I only like extra cheese on my Pizza....,"I really enjoyed the first Chicken Soup books and the stories were warm and fuzzy -- good falling asleep or bathroom reading.....This series, in it's quest to maximize its' fad-like shelf-life, has lapsed into cheesy, moralistic garbage. I admit that I didn't finish the book, but I did not find myself moved, and felt that the book was quite manipulative. Chritianity has better forums than this."
3,"Mistitled book can be used to check your &#65533;vital"" signs","As a previous reviewer observed, there is precious little in this book that is distinctly Christian and parts which are decidedly non-Christian, so if your desire is to find a book which will firm up your faith in Jesus or use as a witnessing tool, you need to look elsewhere. And for those few stories that contain supernatural elements, it is not clear whether they were written just for effect or meant to document true happenings. Still, many of these short stories are extremely moving, so if the tears do not flow freely as you work your way through this book, don't bother to check for a pulse. You have none."
5,It has rekindled my faith in God.,Every story I read brings tears & happiness to me. Never ever has a book done that before. I read certain stories over & over again. It has brought alive the faith which I thought was lost.
3,"Okay, but the earlier books were MUCH better","This is a nice book -- but I, myself, much prefer the earlier books. Most, if not all, of these stories appear to be reprinted from the earlier books -- making this a waste of money if you already own the others. Likewise, many of these stories are nothing special, and appear to have been included solely because of their Christian emphasis ... I, myself, would have much preferred a shorter book comprised of meaningful stories, rather than one padded to make it bigger. Personally, I much prefer the earlier Chicken Soup books, and strongly recommend buying them, instead ... If you want an inspirational Christian book, there are plenty much better than this one."
3,Too much for me,"Ok, I know CSFTS books are famous for uplifting and helping through, but i have to honestly say..... IT DID NOT do the same for me. I highly admire what these peope have overcome but it was honestly more than I could handle. I cried through most of these stories and by the end of the book I was more depressed than uplifted. Of course this is just my personal experience with the book but I can say that it helps to remind you that you are not alone and even helps you count your blessings when you think you got it bad. I do recommed this book but I suggest you proceed with caution if you are easily affected by other peoples pain."
5,Hot Soup(y),"Soupy at his charming best. If you want just plain fun, see Soupy Sales. Good family entertainment."
3,looks good but not for true skating,"i got a pair of these, i skate in them. they look really cool , and they arent bad for skating either. i got some good pop and grip with them, but the problem i definately the toeguard. My stiching is already ripped off to the point that i can put my finger nearly inside the shoe and i have only been skating in them for maybe 3 months.still though, i got a pair for 35 bucks, and that was a great deal. They look really snazzy, like puma meets skating shoe : )however i want to get a pair of emerica heretics .. emerica makes great skate shoes that last forever, or my old pair did at least. they still arent even ripped, but kind of lost their pop and grip."
4,4 because I have not needed it yet,I received the paperwork promptly but have not needed to use it yet so I dont know how well the warranty works but it looks like something everyone should get with any purchase. I am happy having it. You know what they say its better to have it and not need it then need it and not have it.
5,Best Advice I Can Find,"I have personally used the information in this book to buy two small businesses. Mancuso's advice was invaluable to me. If you have what it takes to run a business and want to do so, but don't know where to start, this book is for you."
5,Pleasing Beethoven,"After reading several very favorable reviews of this CD, I purchased a copy and was pleased to find that these performances are as good as claimed. While there are audible differences between these performances and those by Abbado, Monteux, Walter, etc., I cannot say that this is due to the new critical edition of the scores or to the conductor, size of the orchestra, style of playing, or ... you name it. However, this CD is most enjoyable. The sound is good but not outstanding."
5,What a voice!,"I discovered Mike Eldred in December 2005 at a Jim Brickman holiday concert and all I can say is, ""wow,"" why haven't I heard of him before?! This man's voice is excellent and his delivery is professional. I had to find more of his recordings and found this one done in 1990. He not only sings, but has either written the lyrics and/or music on 4 of the songs. I look forward to seeing him in concert, again, and purchasing more of his CD's."
3,An imperfectly written eye opener,"Robert Royal's book ""Catholic Martyrs"" is a decent enough effort. I applaud him vigorously for his efforts. He does a decent enough job in laying out the facts concerning the men and women who have died for the Catholic faith in the 20th century. I found the chapter on the ""forgotten holocaust"", the deaths of 10 million Ukrainian Catholics at the hands of Stalin and the Marxist/Communists to be quite an eye opener. Likewise, his chapter on Edith Stein who died as St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross to be well written.The same cannot be said for some of the other chapters. One reviewer pointed out the one of the more puzzling lines, ""Christ told so-and-so to tell some funny stories"". Okaaay.But those minor slip ups aside, I do recommend this book to anyone who wants to find out more about the courageous men and women who gave their lives for the church. So do buy this book and read it. It is worth your time and money."
5,Inspiring!,"Royal does his readers a great service by showing that the Catholic martyrs of the 20th century were ordinary people who were not afraid to do the extraordinary when it came to standing up for their faith. Unlike other books, which have portrayed martyrs as untouchable icons of virtue and piety, Royal brings a human dimension to each of his stories, making them interesting and relevant to all readers. Thought-provoking, well-researched, and simply fantastic! A must read!"
3,Must see for every mafia movie lover,"For those that want something different from all those Sinatra loving american-born mafioso this is a must. The movie based on a true story and describes the life of Judge Falcone, a man dedicated in fighting the mafia in its nest, Sicily. I gave it 3stars as i find quite short and end very suddenly."
3,"Well, it was a funny idea...","A Night Without Armor II was a clever idea, but it gets boring quickly. The poems aren't interesting or funny enough to keep the book going. Judging by some of Beau's other work, he's an excellent poet. I wish he would put out a book of his more engaging efforts."
4,Beau is God,"He wrote it in four hours and you can tell. Beau Sia is a pretty fantastic spoken word performer and his onstage work is definitely stronger than this. That aside, this book is still a Beau Sia work, making it a cut funnier and more eloquent than the rest. Ironically it reads a bit stronger than many other more popular spoken word artists inspite of the fact that it is a quickly written satire. A wonderful experiment."
3,"great humorous idea, funny ironies, so so literary","I dunno, I 've read Jewels and Bieus books. Jewels is emotional tripe and ""The Revenge"" is a funny satire of it. Unfortunatley it offers nothing that couldnt stand without the original. Some of the poems are down right hilarious but only as far as how much of a joke that is made from Jewel's book. I liked it for a good momentary read but dont really care to look through it again.I wil admit though, Im interested in finding out what he skewers next."
4,Universal Binary Available,"Aspyr Studios has now released a ""Universal"" patch for Generals for Mac, Deluxe Edition. This patch includes binaries that run natively on Intel-based Macs, which should offer the performance that gamers would expect of the platform, rather than the performance of a low-end G3 from 1998, which is what is offered by the PowerPC versions.I wish the Universal binaries were available directly (rather than as a patch), and I would like to see interoperability in multiplayer play with PC versions. However, the campaigns/skirmish games are fantastic. Haven't had the occasion to play it online, but as bad as the network code for the PC original was, it can't get much worse than that."
2,Sluggish on Intel-based Macs,"I bought this game and installed it on an Intel-based Mac, along with the Universal binary patch. Unfortunately it continued to be extremely sluggish. The tractors would move to a snail's pace. Even with the game speed up to its limit. I, too, would have liked to see this game released as an Universal version, instead of just having a patch (that doesn't work) available.As for the game itself, unfortunately they took out the ships from the weapons you could build, thus making the game more limited."
1,Does not work on new Macs,WARNING: This game does not perform well on Intel Macs. I have a MacBook Pro 2.0GHz w/ 2GB of RAM and performance was terrible. Do not buy this product if you own a Mac bought in 2006 or later.
5,An excellent insight in Beholders,You get to know almost anything you would like to know about Beholders and their kin
4,Pella history,"This fictionalized history of the settlement of the Dutch in Pella, Iowa is definitely worth reading. It's an inspiring story of the faith and trials of the Dutch people escaping persecution in the Netherlands and establishing their colony in the Pella where they relish their freedom to worship without the interference of the government. Gives a new appreciation for religious freedom that we enjoy here in America."
5,Great quad for a great price!,"We purchased this for our son, and are very happy with it upon first inspection. Came fully assembled, has most the features that kids would like, horns & lights. Few screws came off during shipment, but other than that, it's perfect. Seems very sturdy and well built for a low cost item, which is great for those who can't afford a gas powered quad, or whose kids aren't ready for one yet! Says for ages 6 and up, but honestly a child who is really good/great at riding Power Wheels quads, should be ready for this around age 4! Remember age 6 is their safety guideline, each child is different, and only you can determine when they are ready for it!The quad is small though, even our regular sized 12V Power Wheels quad, is larger than this, but don't let the size full you, this thing looks made to last!"
2,Quality is questionable....keep looking,"Purchased three of these at Christmas. Horns and lights did not work on but one, another was missing keys when delivered, luckily interchangable. Within 5 days, one four wheeler had a faulty throttle and quit, the drive train fell out of the other with bolts going everywhere, and the third had two bald tires which burst! All this before the new year turned. I contacted the company, and they offered assistance by sending a box of parts in the mail. However, they offered no assistance on actual repair, telling me that ""any man can do it with a few tools"". After several hours and a visit to the tire shop, I fixed the bikes and they seem to work fine for now. I obviously question the quality of the product and be aware return shipping is not an option b/c these bikes are heavy and it would be cost prohibitive. I would buy at a store where I could take back if needed. Good luck."
2,Would not get unless you need something to work on,"Bought this for my 5 year old son for his b-day in april. The connectors for the battery and flag were missing. Took a week to get the parts and the battery connector parts were wrong. I had to go to the hardware store to get the right ones. After riding it for about a week the connectors for the battery became loose had to use electrial tape to hold down. Now the bolts that hold the brake in place came loose and feel out and I cannot find them, so to the store I got to replace them. I would say if you want something that they can just ride and you dont have to work on every week then do not get this. I do say the frame is sturdy and looks to handle all the rough stuff."
4,Mongoose Dirtgrinder,The first one we got was defective. Amazon promptly sent out another one and picked up the defective one. Communication was excellent and the new ATV works very well. I love that we can control the speed with 2 speed settings. I will defnitely keep Amazon in mind for future purchaces whether large or small.
1,Not up to the usual standard of this series,"I have used a number of the ""XYZ made ridiculously simple"" texts, such as neuroanatonmy, microbiology, acid base balance, and so was optimistic that this one would be useful to clarify the morass of renal pathophysiology. It wasn't. It is very ""cutesy"" without being informative. For example, the diagrams are adorable cartoons but are not in any way designed to provide mnenonics for the material. The usual approach for this series is somewhat lighthearted, but focused, and certainly the hard-core material is covered. Not so with this text. There is virtually no useful material and what is presented is either completely trivial (literally high school level, or more like ""patient waiting room at the doctor's office"" level) or the usual laundry list of renal terms that we all could use some help with. Don't bother."
3,Helpful,Makes it easier with lots of pictures in trying to explain this disease process to patients and providers alike.
5,Beautiful Neapolitan Songs,"For the aficionado of neapolitan romantic songs this is a 'must have' recording. There are 14 beautifully arranged and sung neapolitan songs which will tug on the strings of your heart. Even if you do not understand the neapolitan dialect, the music and masterful singing will bring the meanings home for you. It is simply the best! Bella musica!"
4,like the characters,"second in the series of three, the characters are interesting, the story is good, I enjoyed all three books, would recommend all three."
4,"Love, Honor and Survival Keeps You Reading!","Marsha Ward's western novel of love, honor and survival is an exciting ride from beginning to end. From watching his brother marry his fiance to rescuing a Mexican bride when her intended is killed, the story kept me reading with good conflict and plenty of action. Just when I thought things were going a little too smoothly, Marsha throws in an unexpected twist. I recommend Ride to Raton.Heidi M. Thomas,Cowgirl Dreams"
5,well done,"After reading the first three in the series, I could'nt find others for my kindle... will there be more in the series of the ""Owens family saga""??? It was obvious that she (Marsha Ward) did her homework... I cowboyed for several years.. Good read.."
2,nonstick coating comes off,I bought 4 of these springform pans to make cheesecake for gifts.Two of them started to peel and I had to toss them.
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks!","At first I was happy with this pan, but the first time I baked something that had a more liquid base it leaked. I can't bake a cheesecake in this because it makes a huge mess of my oven. I'm tossing it out and finding one that won't leak."
2,Poor coating overcomes glass bottom advantage,"I was so excited to find a glass-bottomed springform pan so that I could put desserts baked in it directly onto a pretty serving plate, with no unsighly metal bottom rim showing. I always wash my nonstick pans, including this one, by hand, and am careful to use only a thin silicone spatula or plastic knife to loosen the edges of my desserts. But after several uses, I've noticed large patches of the nonstick surface gone and am having to swallow my disappointment and trash this product. I hope we haven't swallowed some of that nonstick coating along with our desserts, and I'm glad no young children have eaten them. Now I'll look for a heavy, high-end 10"" springform pan, without much hope of finding one with a lovely glass bottom."
1,Great for Target Practice,Paper thin glass. They broke within 5 seconds out of the box. I dropped a few coins in them and the bottom broke out. Now I will use for target practice with my BB gun.....
3,its a vase,"I wouldn't pay more than the $1.00 I paid for it, its kinda cheaply made, and I don't know if I'm gonna chance putting any water in it to wash away the color, but its a nice bright centerpiece. Got some blue and green and red ones and they are a nice colorful addition to my apartment."
1,vague and outdated,"This book is outdated - written almost 20 years ago. The advice is vague and it sounds like the author hasn't even been to Russia! If you are looking for a book on how to get a job in Russia, I found this other book to be much more up-to-date and relevant:How to Get a Job in Russia: a practical guide for native English speakersIt is more expensive, but it is extremely useful and practical advice and it was written this year."
2,Even Janeane Can't Save This One!,"If you're looking for quirky, at times annoying comedy, this is the tape for you. If you're searching out Janeane material, leave this one on the shelf. Janeane makes very brief appearances, dropping half-hearted jokes each time. Bobcat gives the only performance worth watching, the other three comics pretty much miss the mark."
4,Great for cooperation,"I really enjoyed this game. Good progression of the story line through the game. Graphics are great. On the parts I could not figure out, my sister and I worked together. Two heads are definitely better than one."
2,"I beat the game, what do I do now?","Okay, i'll agree the game was a good alternative to the all the first person shooters out there, but what are you susposed to do with it after you've solved all the puzzles?Call me crazy, but I think one of the most important factors of a good game is replay value and Myst just doesn't have this. When you get stuck on a puzzle, there's nothing to do but ask a friend who's beaten the game what to do next. And as i've asked before, What are you susposed to do after you beat the game? (and please don't say ""you could always play it again"", because if you do, i'll know you're truly a geek:)I know it would defeat the perpose of this genre of beautiful non-violent games but I would like to see a combination of Myst and Doom in the future. A game where you could kill a few monsters while you're between quests."
2,More puzzling than a Ribuk's Cube!,"What what game I'm describing. It's old, it's puzzling, and it's a blockbuster game. It's, you guessed it, Myst. And that is probably the easiest puzzle you'll get concerning Myst, too. Since it is a popular game that was released a quite a long time ago, you've probably heard of it by now. I'll just say this one thing: If you're deaf or impatient, AVOID. There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones...heck, even if you're NOT deaf, it's still quite a puzzler! But don't fret...you can beat this game in FIVE MINUTES if you know how, and it can be found in the many game walk-throughs of the Internet. After all, with the difficulty of THESE puzzles, rest assured, you'll be looking for one!"
1,Sorry but I was disappointed!,Saw so many grand statements about this program and how great it was only to be disappointed. Maybe I'm just not a game player - certainly not a Myst enthusiast! I would be happy to sell my copy!
2,this game is so slow,"I can see why this game was so hyped in 1993. CD-ROMs were cutting edge and the ""slideshow"" graphics are fairly good and so is the sound. However, the story isn't as interesting as the ambiance would have you think and the movement is absolutely, irritatingly choppy.I don't believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help. There is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest person.I don't like having to resort to hints in order to play a game because it's released before the necessary technology is truely ready.REALmyst?...I no longer care. Riven and Myst3?...even more clue-less and annoying, I'm sure."
3,cd Rom + What do I do? + Impossibilities =,"WHAT IS THIS?!No but seriously. They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful. But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology. It doesn't really need to be *easier* We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do. But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: ""What the heck is this?"" ""Why am I playing this?"" ""Gah! What am I supposed to do?!?!""Buy then and only then."
2,Why is this a classic?,"This game continues to haunt my memories as an irritation because of it's length and puzzles, which usually amounted to no more than treading back and forth across the island of Myst. While the environments were increadibly beautiful, they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay, which has you go to one place at least 5 times to solve five different puzzles. The story is intruiging, yet the game's ending fails to please the player, since, you'll discover shortly after completing it, it could be completed in a matter of minutes.A good game for 10 to 20 dollars, but you shouldn't spend more than that on this weekend game."
2,Myst,"Too hard for me. I have been using a walkthrough to figure it out. O.K., but not what I had hoped for. Least favorite game so far that I have purchased. Kids probably love it but it's not for this 61 year old granny."
5,A Classic,"Great puzzle game. Hours and hours of mind-bending entertainment that's appropriate for family members of all ages. We've been playing Myst and the sequels in our family for over 15 years, and they always satisfy."
3,Cool game!,This game was a little difficult to get my computer to be compatible with. Good thing my Dad is a computer wiz. Once I got the game running it was very addicting. Love games like this. Wish there was an updated version of this game and the series! Too fun!
4,A great game,"This Game is a good game depending on your personality. If you like to drive around in a car in New York City or shooting up alien invaders,in other words you like games with a lot of action, then this is probably not the game for you. there is no action, or enemies. Myst is more of exploring and puzzle solving. It requires quite a bit of patience to play. If your looking for an adventure/puzzle game then you should get myst. in my opinion it is a great game. one of the best i have ever played"
4,A very good game!,It took me a while but I was able to solve Myst! I enjoyed it's unique interface and no directions just move around it and figure it out for yourself style! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge and wants to solve a mystery!
3,"Great looking, interesting...but so CONFUSING!","I like this game...i really do, but i just don't get it. I'll agree that the concept is wonderful, and the graphics are great, and the story is stellar...but geez, i just don't get a lot of it! I love books, and eat up logic puzzles and games, but i just don't like this game enough to try to wade my way through the absolutely too complex world that you're supposed to journey though to do...what? I think that's what urks me the most...i have no idea what i'm supposed to be doing half the time...and somehow that diminishes my enjoyment of the game. I'm not certain whether to recommend this game or not. If you can get a chance to play it without buying it, i'd go that route, then if you like it you can buy it, but if you don't you don't have to waste your money."
5,One of the best,This is without doubt one of the best computer games I ever played. The consept is totally different from any other game. The graphics are amazing. The story is incridible too. For the first time in computer gaming you actually FEEL you are the person in the game. Simply one of the best.
1,Myst,"You deceived me. Myst doesn't run under Win 7 at all. Why don't you tell your customers this minor detail? A complete waste of money for someone who loved the game when it first came out. Thanks for nothing.Oh, now you want me to edit this? OK, your service stinks too"
1,was a bummer,I guess it is my fault but when I purchase a game I expect it to work on computersthat were built in this century :) It is sitting in the box in my closet..unplayed :(
1,New Computer Owners Beware !!,"So I bought this game for my son thinking he'd get a kick out of a game that the old man played. Missed the spec that Amazon is still selling the Windows 3.X version of this game ! Are you kidding me??? Who owns a computer that can handle Windows 3.X? I put the disk in the machine (Windows 7) and that was the full extent of its ""playability."" Won't load, won't play, waste of $20 -- Thanks Amazon. What's next? Games that only run in DOS? My bad for not scrutinizing every line of the specs, just figured if it played in the 1990s surely any computer in 2012 would slay it."
2,Mostly Boring,THis should have been a 5-15min clip. Instead it keeps going and going and going.THe band is sympathetic. But most of footage is them complaining about their refugee status. For three hours.
2,It's ok.....,"This is the first vibrator I have ever bought, so maybe I don't have enoughe experience to give a review, but I will give one anyway. It is very cute, and doesn't look like a typical vibrator. At first it feels nice, but then after a few minutes gets kind of dull. Thing is, there are not alot of options with this. I will just have to keep buying and trying, I guess......"
2,Low Intensity,"The Octopus produces very low intensity vibrations, due to its small size, I'm sure. Better than doing things the old fashioned way but not by much. One thing I do have to say in its favor is that it is very quiet and the size is discreet enough to hide it easily."
3,buy one that ISNT photomosaic!,"i bought this puzzle because my favorite art piece of all time is featured on it.the only reason i purchased it as opposed to other ones like it was that is was cheaper.that was a mistake.i didnt know that the term ""photomosiac"" meant scribbled on.a pm puzzle is the picture itself but wherever theres empty space it has thousands of tiny pictures.so it looks like i have my favorite painting with grafitti on it to me.i bought it so i intend to finish it,but its not as cool as it sounds.if thats what you were thinking.i need a lot of light to even see the pieces.when i do,they dont even seem to match when they fit.it might be say the yellow of the moon with a tiny sunflower on it with a pale purple impression on it.the next piece might have none of these colors.its going to be a major pain in the butt to finish.ive sat down to it 3 times and havent even finished the border yet.i say do not buy this.buy the regular jigsaw version,the more traditional one."
3,MANY starry night,"this puzzle is a very big challenge im still in the process of workin on it, i bought a photo mosaic pizzle ( monarch butterfly) which wasnt 2 bad but this puzzle is much more of a challenge idk abt any1 else but i have 2 go piece by piece"
2,"Hell, Hot, Mild, and then Watered Down","Don't get me wrong, I love Del Ray. Far and away, she is one of the top 5 live performers I have ever had the pleasure to sit in front of. However, she should be advised to shy away from over-production as her style ONLY benefits from the bare roots approach to recording.THIS WOMAN IS INCREDIBLE! Talented, Beautiful, and Cunning. And it is such a shame to hear her music with such clutter killing the ambiance. Such is her choice and I must respect it.If you ever get the chance to hear one of her solo shows, GO. There will never be anything to match it ever again."
1,What A Lame Book,folks Make Mistakes what's the Point? Different Cases&Subjects carry different Weight.but The N.F.L doesn't Reflect The General Population.also Most Of The Attack I feel is DIrected African-American Players.funny How Nobody Mentions all the Bad-Boys Of Baseball especially Pre-Jackie Robinson Era? cuz The Wack Racist Author was trying to Make A Point and we Know who it was Directed to? go pick on The Hockey Players that get Paid To Assault each other on the Ice every Night?Yeah I'm waiting for that Book?
5,Wake up NFL,"I was suprised at the conduct & statistics in this book, but not shocked. Being an avid football fan in a football city I've seen and heard the coverups. Hopefully this expose will be a catalyst for the League to institute a plan for help for the ""men"". Even their coaches ignore the law and thier dirt swept under the rug. Two words would clean up the whole mess --- ""Your fired"""
4,excellent book. warning may damage your love of the NFL,"At times it read too much like a list rather than a book, but it was eye opening. I think we might suspect stuff like this goes on, but never to this degree. Raising awareness of this behavior in sports will go a long way to changing the way paying customers reward franchises and universities that accept it."
3,The author doesn't believe the findings,"This review is really about a paper coauthored by Jeff Benedict (coauthor of this book) that refutes the basic conclusions of the book. The article ""Criminal Violence of NFL Players Compared to the General Population,"" which appeared in the Summer 1999 issue of the statistical magazine Chance, reanalyzes these data, and comes to the conclusion that NFL players have, in fact, LOWER crime rates than the general population. I quote: ""Thus, even though our initial assessment was that the NFL rates looked very high, we find them well below the rates for the general population"" (page 14). You can buy the book for a fun read, but don't make the mistake that one of the authors now admits - these data do not support the contention that NFL players are more likely to be criminals; rather, they REFUTE it!"
1,Faulty research?,I agree with the reviewer who said that the pool of athletes these statistics are derived from is too small. Culture and ethnicity are also factors given little scrutiny in the author's methodology.
4,Shocking,"The NFL loves to portray its players as gladiators on the field, but gentle giants off. Benedict and Yeager let us in on the truth, which is that the brutality doesn't end when the whistle blows. I was disgusted not only by the crimes revealed, but also by the lack of adequate punishment in most of the cases. This book is not always a page-turner, as the authors document many players' criminal histories in great detail, but it's a must for professional football fans who want to know the truth about Sunday's heroes."
5,This is my favorite puzzle!,"I love most all puzzles, but this is the first type of puzzle I've done where the individual pieces are so intriguing. I loved looking at all the little pictures that make up each piece so much that I subsequently put together a large number of the rest of the photomosaic puzzles available.The rendering of the space shuttle is beautiful, and it looks great in a frame."
2,Aggravating beyond reason!,"My husband and I are both puzzle buffs, and I got him this for his birthday. It was the most exasperating experience of my life! The photos that make up the mosaic are repeated all through the puzzle, making it difficult to pinpoint where a piece should go. Also, the puzzle is about an inch larger than the image on the box, so it was nearly impossible just to assemble the frame. My husband gave up, so I finished the puzzle just out of principle, but it was really unpleasant. Unless you're a masochistic puzzler, skip the photomosiacs."
3,i was in this,i was in this. And when she fell they said they do takes and we worked all weekend. I t was good pay. London. She really look old but ok for
4,great product,"I scoured the internet looking for a high quality stockpot and this has exceeded all my expectations! My only complaint is that it does not come with a lid. Hence the four stars instead of five. Other than that, it's a great product. Company shipped promptly, too."
4,Turn your radio on . . .,"Subtitled ""The Men Who Made Radio,"" this book is concerned with the principal actors developing radio: Marconi, Sarnoff, Armstrong, and De Forrest. Sarnoff (""The General"") was the egoist who founded RCA, and Armstrong was the secretive inventor of FM who refused to compromise and lost everything (and committed suicide). The first half of the book is the best; it's all about the inventors and their new inventions and is very interesting. The second half suffers from being mostly about the legal hassling that occurred among the principals. Recommended."
5,Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio,"Empire of the Air: The Men Who Made RadioAnyone who is interested in the world of radio where it started and where it has come to, may be interested in knowing about this book. I found it very interesting and enlightening. I read this book years ago and bought a paperback copy to be sent to a talk show person on WLBR radio 1270 KHz in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. As one should be aware of where we came from and the background of a profession, if one profess to know how one fits into the current history of the workings of an operation/profession."
3,Impressions After Visiting Molokai,"I purchased the book before my trip hoping to learn about the place. It's not a bad book, but I didn't feel like I learned much from it. It is more of a love letter written by the author who is a local resident and business owner in Kaunakakai. The photos are nice although not spectacular, and there are plenty of them, giving a good general overview. During my trip a friend loaned me a Lonely Planet guide to Hawaii which I got much more out of as far as learning about Molokai."
2,Lots of potential ... but no payoff,"This series started off well with an interesting and plausible concept incorporating minor characters from the NJO series. When an insect colony absorbs a Jedi into its hive mind it learns the value of caring for the individual. The unforeseen consequence soon threatens the known universe - population explosion and territorial expansion of the insect hive.Author Troy Denning comes up with intriguing twists for all the major characters, but except for Leia finally becoming a Jedi Knight, the series ends without resolving any of the issues that Denning creates, making for a very unsatisfying conclusion to a tale that could have been told in one long novel."
3,Felt rushed (spoliers),"Three books in one year by the same author? It's a hard feat, no wonder Timothy Zahn's original Star Wars extended universe trilogy took three years to be published. Between the plot holes and unresolved situations at the end of this book, the ending was something of a moot point and altogether unimportant to the next phase of the NJO. The title picture and back cover blurb lead you to believe an epic battle will take place at the end, but no. Luke's battle with Lomi midway thrpugh was better handled. Even against the two oponents he fights at the end he has a relatively easy time of it. A ""Lightning display of the Force"" coupled with the cover picture also lead you to belive there would be something new (and maybe a little sinister) coming from Luke.Think not. Nothing really new here at all. This trilogy could've been done in one 700 page book and done well. Instead they get three books out of you for 8 bucks a piece."
5,Passing of the torch.,"This really was well written. I enjoyed it. Others have complained that it was a cliff hanger, but that was its purpose. I saw it as a passing of the torch from the Luke/Leia/Han to the new generation Jacen, Jaina, Ben and the other young Jedi Knights. Denning did a very good job with the story and brought out some new revelations for Luke and Jacen. This is well worth your time to read and add to your collection."
2,Just Awful,"This series has to be the worst since The Jedi Academy Trilogy. Totally destroyed Jainas character. She is the Sword of the Jedi and Denning turns her into a punk joiner. Come on, wheres the continuity in that. Plus, a trilogy about bugs.Boring!!! Especially after something as ambitious as the NJO story arc. Lomi Plo and Raynar Thul should have stayed dead. hopefully LOTF will be better."
2,the decline of quality star wars material,this book was boring. it was quickly and sloppily wrapped up and left me with less than a head scratch. the characters were very out of character. where is timothy zahn when you need him.
4,"Not bad, it was a nice way to pass the time between episodes","Booth is on a case in Chicago which involves the mob. Someone is stringing up the bones of murder victims and recreating whole skeletons. He needs the expertise of his fellow partner, Temperance Brennan, for this macabre case and she leaves D.C to help him. There are a number of villains in this story and Booth and Temperance have to sort them all out to find the bad guys.This wasn't a bad story. It wasn't great, but it was a nice way to pass the time between episodes. There is one a** kicking scene that had me laughing. Somehow, reading about Bones' martial art skills is not the same as watching them. There is good chemistry between Booth and Bones that was nice and they have their customary witty repartee. I enjoyed this story/episode. It wasn't bad. If there are any more, I wouldn't mind reading them. Enjoy!"
5,Read it in one sitting,"The book had a fast-paced interesting storyline. Mr Collins also managed to capture the characters and their ""ways"" of interacting as portrayed on TV. As a fan of the show, I enjoyed the read. Well worth the price I paid for it!"
4,Fun read for what it is,"First, note that this book is NOT written by Kathy Reichs, the original creator of the Temperance Brennan character. (Hopefully, Amazon will fix that error on the page.) This novel is a spin-off from the TV series BONES, and should not be confused with the novels written by Reichs.Compared with Reichs's books, this falls far short, naturally. It's just a fun read for those of us who are utterly addicted to the TV series and need a fix to hold us over between episodes! Actually, this book doesn't do complete justice to the characters on screen, either, but it ain't bad for capturing the repartee and chemistry between Brennan and Booth.Like I said, if you're addicted to the show like me, this book comes in handy when you're waiting for season 1 on DVD or stuck in the days that stretch long between Wednesdays (or thru the baseball playoffs!)."
4,Good read,"Not as great as Kathy Reichs but a good read. Just like the tv show Bones. A little confusing because if u read Reichs books, she shows temperance Brennan in a different light. But, if u like show, is easy to follow her quirky personality"
3,Bones w/Booth,It's ok but I've gotten used to reading about her relationship with Ryan. TV is great for Booth and her.
1,Has printing a paperback become rocket science?,"I could have done without the inclusion of two acts of ""The Tempest"" that replaced pages 85 - 116. Luckily, the plot of ""Bones Buried Deep"" wasn't rocket science, either, so what was left out the copy I purchased from Amazon wasn't that much of a loss."
4,BONES for the TV fan,"I really enjoyed this one. It is nothing like Kathy Reichs books, but it is like the TV show. Since I saw the TV show before I read any of Ms. Reichs books, I enjoyed the fact that the characters here were the TV characters.That doesn't mean that I have any problems with the books by Ms. Reichs. They are really good. I just wish that the TV show had followed the books a bit more closely, but then when do TV or movies give a fig for the book that they are derived from.Long live BONES and long live Kathy Reichs. There is definately room enough for ""Bones"" and Tempe!"
5,Wanting More!,"I was disappointed with a blue-eyed Booth, but after getting over that, the book was perfect in every aspect of character interaction and interesting plot. Please Mr. Collins write more crimes for Bones & Booth to solve."
4,"Good, but not as GOOD as Kathy Reichs original novels","I have had a good time reading this book - but comparing it to Kathy Reichs original novels, it's a little wanting in depth and detail. I understand that this is a book that is based on the TV show - and I do LOVE the TV show, but I didn't feel that I connected with this Tempe Brennan as well as I connected with the pre-TV Tempe Brennan.A good read, but I highly suggest that you read all of Kathy Reiches' novels - - - they are WONDERFUL. I love her depth of character that she protrays in her original novels - in these novels there is a woman that I can connect with and understand...I find it a little hard to connect with the TV version Tempe - but I do love the addition of Booth. I loved David B on Buffy/Angel - and I was started watching this TV program BECAUSE of him, but the actual TV program did catch and keep my attention. I just wish the book had as much depth as the show."
1,Character theft and assasination,"This book is not by Kathy Reichs. It is by Max Collins, but features Tempe Brennan. I love Tempe Brennan - Kathy Reichs' forensic anthropologist. Why she let this author use her character's name and some other characteristics is beyond me. Here, the character and the story is flat, one-dimensional, linear and written poorly. It's like a cheap knock-off that is obvious to all once you buy the book and begin reading. What a disappointment."
1,Novel based on the TV based on the Novel- WHAT?,"I can't believe this exists! There are already ""Bones books."" Smart, well-written mysteries with nuanced characters.Coming up with this TV-tie-in crap is just shameless merchandising. What if this is the first Bones book someone reads, and s/he gets soured on the idea of Kathy Reichs' novels?"
3,It's an okay book,This book is not what I expected. It's too general because it attempts to cover everything. I think it's best for people who have just started thinking about grad school.
3,Disappointing,"WARNING: Contains SpoilersI've read the previous three books in this series and loved them! However, I found this book to be disappointing, especially with the romantic subplot. Strip Poker appears to be the last book in the series, so why on earth did the author leave the ending to the romantic subplot open-ended? I fully expected Sierra and John Nailor to be together at the end and to be in a full-on romantic relationship, totally committed to each other, but at the end of the book you don't know what's going to happen with them!You also don't know who the mobster really is either - he's not ""Uncle Moose""!Vincent and Marla weren't in it much and I enjoy their characters.Overall, I would give it 2.5 stars because I'm so disappointed with the ending. Her previous books in the series were 5 star books for me."
5,Bring Back Sierra!,"I read the other three books in this series a few years ago and just got around to picking up a used copy of this one. And I'm disappointed -- not in the story, but that there's no more Sierra!I don't know why the author stopped this series. I've read her other books and while they're good, they can't hold a candle to this series. The characters, the storytelling, the mystery -- everything put together makes it a book you don't want to put down, and a series you don't want to see left hanging when there's still so much story to tell.Bring back Sierra!"
3,A Fish Story,"When I first heard of THE LAST MARLIN I thought it was like most fishing books, long and drawn out with no real point. Then I found out it was written by Fred Waitzkin, who also wrote SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISHER, I thought it must be good. How wrong I was. This book has very little to do with fishing and alot to do with Fred Waitzkin telling the story of his (not so) troubled youth. Although the title is somewhat misleading, and this is not the text I imagined it is written well, and has a few pages that will interest fishing enthusiasts. If you want a book on fishing try FISHING'S BEST SHORT STORIES edited by Paul D. Saudohar, or THE HUNGRY OCEAN BY Linda Greenlaw. If a memoir is more to your liking then THE LAST MARLIN might be for you."
5,Jackson's Are Family!,"I love this DVD I love the behind the scenes access this DVD gives from Michael's show, and it's narrated by Mr Marlon him self!"
2,Sorry,"I was very, very dissappointed with this DVD, everyone wants to see Michael, he was only in one or two shots, then it was only about 45 minutes long, I will sell it for $6 if anyone is interested."
3,"The Jacksons: America's First Family of Music, Vol. 1","This could have been better. I'm not gone to say why, but it could have been a whole lot better."
4,It was an ok documentary,"This dvd was basically a documentary that was in parts interesting but mostly nothing new that most people havent seen. It also was not very long. Just feel should have gotten more interesting fact, but still not bad."
3,A good game,"It's a fun game, and Is very fun to play, especially when you mix is with the catz game. The only problem is that it takes so much room. You pretty much need a seperate computer for playing it."
2,A disappointment,"I dearly loved Dan Jurgens' run on the ""Superman"" comic books -- he wrote and drew some of my favorite Superman stories of all time, not the least of which was the infamous ""Death of Superman"" storyline. This is not that storyline, however -- it's a rehash of the story years down the line filtered through the perceptions of a stereotypical comic book ""crusading journalist"" type. The new characters are dull and the old characters don't really add much to the story that we didn't get ten years ago when it was printed the first time.If anyone gets this paperback, it'll be Superman completists. People looking for a good Superman story -- get the original Death & Return saga... I'm afraid you won't find it here."
4,A Great Help with organizing!,"I like that the case is large enough to accomodate 8 dolls and clothing, however, it's not very secure storage for smaller accessories."
2,Disappointing,"Having kissed my share of frogs I had high hopes for the story, but it dragged. You never really get attached to the character and just keep reading to get the end. don't bother. There is no end. Very anticlamactic. She has no big character growth, no life altering event, no real conclusion at all. I can only assume Karrie's life will go on as it has for the first 45 years, I'm just glad I don't have to read about the next 45. don't waste your time."
1,Like being trapped at a party by a narcissistic princess...,"A rambling, self-obsessed, horrendously written bore. If you don't know any obnoxious NY princesses, and you are simply desperate to feel like you're at a really bad party, monopolized by a self-absorbed narcissist, you will find your own personal ring of hell with this book!! Otherwise, steer clear!"
1,"Lots of pages, but not much fun","I'm all about books that are written from the single girl's point of view (i.e. Bridget Jones's Diary, The Devil Wears Prada, etc.) but this book, which details the life of the heroine in non-chronological order, is not a fun read. The reader never feels any true empathy for the Karrie Kline, nor does her romantic exploits satisfy the reader's imagination. There are better written, more interesting, and poignant books one could read instead. Don't waste your time flipping through over 400 pages waiting to like the book. Because even the ending, not the content, but how it is written-- cut short and dry, leaves the reader frustrated."
4,I enjoyed it,"Do not expect a deep book,what you will get is an interesting read about the horrible dates and relationships this woman went through. It's interesting to know that I am not the only one finding these men, it's common for other women. I enjoyed it."
2,Hard to follow...,"I flopped back and forth on my rating of this book. The beginning was hard for me to get into as the author writes in an almost a choppy form. Then I really got into the middle part of the book and couldn't put it down. Then, with about 100 pages left, I had to force myself to finish reading it! I have never had such mixed emotions about a book before. Normally if it is hard for me to get into, I eventually start liking it or hating it all the way through. I don't really know how to give a review on this book as it was hard for me to read. I know that is not a huge help but I always recommend to try something out for yourself because everyone is different."
4,Very cute!,"This was a very cute and entertaining book about dating ALL the wrong men and finding out what is important and when enough is enough! IF I were her, I would have given up long ago! Everything from the cab driver to Elliot.It also dealt with family and how important their role is in your life. It proves you may think you are happy to pretend to be someone else, but in the end you are better off being yourself.And heck in the end, if all else fails, go buy a dog!!!! Enjoy!"
5,Delicious,"Laurie blows up a ballon labelled religion, romance, wanting, needing and believing and punctures it with sadness, bitterness, and then acceptance. One of the best chick lit I've read so far as it deals with real grown up stuff. A highly recommended read."
3,Bill winston was way better,"Bill Winston Ministries on his web site has a really good one on ""How many frogs do I have to kiss to find a prince?"" and this blows the reviewed book here way out of the ball park making this book a strike out compared to Bill Winston! I have actually been able to help someone from this ministry on TV message the show BELIEVERS WALK OF FAITH on DayStar Network (KSXC). That pain full longing and not knowing is now being directed in the pathway of God the Lord. Why worry about such little things when what we should do as is directed in the BIBLE to not worry and fear. Literally directed and stated in the Bible. If you want someone the best thing to do is make yourself whole first and start on the self with the Lord God and Holy Spirit inside ourselves, then when the time comes we can function better with someone."
3,Not what I was hoping for,I was excited to read this book and was very happy with it until the last 50 pages. I guess maybe I can't relate to this book very well b/c I've never been through this. I'm still glad I read it and would recommend it to anyone who has had bad dates.
2,Not Impressed,"I think this book was too long; should have ended way before it did. Not the worst book I ever read, but certainly not the best. I would not recommend it."
4,Immensely entertaining,"I love all of the Red Dress Ink books I have read, and when I spotted this one in the bookstore, it looked like it would be right up my alley. And it was. The protagonist, Karrie Kline, had a strong voice that came through clearly in these series of humorous vignettes about dating. The author was also able to keep what could be a depressing subject mostly upbeat. She seemed to observe her experiences in a positive light and move on into the next experience. I think everyone has a little of Karrie Kline in them, especially when it comes to the dating world. Though the novel was quite long, it did move very quickly and actually made me laugh out loud at several parts! I have recommended it to all of my friends who are dating and need a good laugh. And, of course, I recommend it to anyone who is in the mood to read a great book."
1,So what?,"It's rare that I do not finish a book, but I had to put this one down. It was nothing like I expected it to be. The writing just was not captivating enough to make me force myself to finish it. I feel a book is only good if you can care about the characters in one way or another, and this book made me think, ""So what?""I wouldn't waste my money. Well, actually, I did. But if I was you and I hadn't bought the book yet, I wouldn't waste my money."
3,Good if you're a 45 year-old Jewish actress in New York,"Each chapter is a different date or guy she dated. It gets monotonous until halfway through the book when you start to see some repeats of characters. It just seems like bad date after bad date, and it's a lot of bad dates before she learns not to be so desperate.I had a hard time relating to the main character because there are a lot of cultural factors that come with being Jewish and trying to date. There is, however, an opportunity to learn about the Jewish culture from this book. You can also learn about being an actress in the dating world.I thought the book dragged, and the ending disappointed me. I?m 25 right now and still single, and the thought of spending another 20 years in the dating world is depressing to me."
2,Not recommended...,"It was a chore to finish this book. Karrie (lead character) drove me nuts, and the subplot about the random meeting of her unknown father on a set was completely unrealistic. I've read most of the RDI books, and this was one of the worst. It's not a good sign when celebrities supply the blurbs on the cover and back instead of other authors. Read the new Shannon Olson book instead."
1,Save your money,It takes a lot for me to put a book down without finishing it. In the history of me reading there have only been 3 books that I have put down without finishing. This is one of them. The premise is that a lady is on the hunt for a man to settle down with. The chapters are written as if a diary history of 10 years of dating. The chapters are not immediately connected and the main character is so slimly designed that you could care less if a bus hits her. I would put this on one of the all time worst chick-lit books ever written. And to top that off probably one of the worst books ever. I find more interest in reading bathroom wall graffiti than this.
5,From Caracas to Stockholm,Very good. This is the second time I review it favourably. Please check your files and don't ask me anymore.
