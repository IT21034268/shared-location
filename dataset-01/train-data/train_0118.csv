5,A No-Brainer Superior Greatest Hits!!,"Too often, the problem with many greatest hits albums is that they leave off crucial tracks, thus forcing people to buy the original albums that they may not want. Most people buying a greatest hits compilation just want the essentials, and in that case, this CD succeeds stupendously. Each of their four albums is given generous representation, and the CD is well over 70 minutes of excellence. Though Sade has been unfortunately lumped in with the reprehensible ""smooth jazz"" crowd, their music is so much more. Take ""Is It A Crime"" for instance. The song was recorded live in one take, and is purely organic and totally haunting. Who can't relate to the emotions expressed in this song when one has gone through a breakup? Though many of these songs are now 20 years old, they have lost none of their appeal, sound amazing, and show why Sade still has a career ahead of them."
5,Timeless appeal,"Though Sade reached her commercial high point in the mid/late 80s, none of the songs on this best-of collection sound at all dated when listened to 10 years after they were hits. Her group was dismissed by some critics as ""elevator music,"" but Sade crafted a brand of exotic pop-jazz which has withstood the test of time in today's extraordinarily fickle world of pop music. Her thoughtful lyrics, cool sophistication and consistent artistic direction give Sade a timeless appeal which ranks her alongside Whitney Houston and Anita Baker as one of the foremost divas of her generation. Highlights include the hits ""Smooth Operator,"" ""The Sweetest Taboo"" and ""No Ordinary Love"" as well as the lesser known songs ""Jezebel"" and ""Is It A Crime."""
5,The best in R&B that I've heard,I find her voice very haunting and some of the easiest and smoothest songs I've ever heard since New Orleans Jazz. And my cats and dog all give it 2 paws up :)Keep up the great work
1,"Gawd, you're kidding me, right?","This is the worst piece of ... I've heard in a long time. Heavily arranged pop cheese gathered on one disc. The players are good, the singer is good, but the tunes are pure cheese, while the players are held back from playing anything that's actually musical. If Sade wants to be a jazz singer, she should try singing something with some meat in it, and learn to improvise, as well as let her musicians improvise and swing. This is smooth R&B at it's elevator music blandest."
5,best of sade,"I had this cd before but lost it. So I purchased another one, and I still love it! Loving the new Sade as well, Soldier of Love!!"
4,Classic,Sade is one of those people who transcends all boundaries she is truly timeless. I still have this CD playing in my car I can't take it out. If you have any type of appreciation for GOOD music check her out.
5,Awesome!,This CD is soo great. I can listen to it over and over and never get sick of it. I definitly recomend it.
5,the best of Sade,"I got this because of one of the Songs ""Love is stronger than pride"" that got my curiosity, but the singer was disappointing and the songs too. She sings like a robot and has no mentionable range. I donated the cd to the local library. The shipping and price were, as usual, perfect, no problem in that area."
3,When Sade Finishes Running From The Police.........,"I enjoy Sade's work but am annoyed that she doesn't sing anything new. She needs to make another album so I don't have to listen to the same songs over and over again.So whenever she finishes running from the police in Africa and pays her bail or has her trial or whatever she's doing, I wish she would write more music. Otherwise, I highly recommend all of Sade's albums."
5,Excellent,"Put this on the hi-fi, pour yourself and your loved one a large glass of red wine. Sit back and enjoy."
5,Breathtaking CD!,Sade has a beautiful voice and this CD is awesome. I have no regrets whatsoever purchasing this CD - Awesome!
5,Amazing Neural Net Introduction!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It introduces neural networks, with a strong emphasis on biological plausibility. For example, the book compares the visual systems of simple animals with neural network feature extraction. Anderson moves effectively among evolutionary biology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and behavioral psychology. His insights are important, clear, and often funny as well. The book gently introduces source code for implementing the various neural networks that he describes."
2,Not Practical,"There's nothing really wrong with this book - it's just not useful for someone wanting to actually program a neural network system.I read all sorts of stuff about the nervous systems in horseshoe crabs, but I don't find myself able to do anything with neural networks. Therefore, I'm scouring the Internet to find some source code examples or a tutorial of some kind.If you want to know miscellaneous information about neural networks, go ahead and buy the book. But if you actually want to construct neural networks, buy something else."
3,"Not the best, not the worst","If you have hard water, you'll probably end up using A LOT of this product with each cleaning. Not the best, but it does help a little."
1,I don't know about this one...,"I see these great reviews to this book and wonder if we read the same book...I wasn't impressed with this book at all. I never give this low of rating but I felt I totally wasted my money and gained nothing from the book.Like the other reviewers say full of other mail order campaigns. That is right, most of the entire book. If you are looking for ideas as what to see then maybe that can help you. If you already know what you want to mail order I didn't see where this book helped at all. The book is full of photocopies of others campaigns and I got absolutely nothing out of the entire book that helped, enthused or motivated me at all."
5,A classic fairytale,"There have been numerous takes on this story. The Polar Bear King, The Golden Compass(both movies), East (a book for young adults); they're all based on this Norwegian fairy tale of a nameless loving girl who went to live with the polar bear king to save her family. I can't say enough about this story. I grew up listening to rabbit ears books on tape. Every time I left home, stayed in hotels, or had trouble sleeping I would listen to this story and I could calmly doze off. There is a wonderful strings/piano background and extended score that your child will always remember, and Max Von Sydow's voice is deep, rumbling, and comforting to any young child, like your own grandfather telling you a story. If you have children, get this, King Midas (Yo-Yo Ma and Michael Caine!!!), Jack and the Beanstalk (members from Monty Python! don't worry it's completely appropriate :D), and all the other Rabbit Ears audio cds!"
1,Ballets Russes Without That Pesky Dancing,This was a BIG disappointment because the ad didn't make clear that it was not ballet but rather interviews with octogenarian dancers. The only dancing was a few 10-second inserts. Wasted money!
3,For the serious ballet lover only,"It's really long, but if you love ballet this is for you. The history and clips of the really great ballerinas are wonderful. But if you're expecting a full-length ballet, this is not it. I ordered it because it got such great reviews, but frankly I couldn't sit through it in one sitting."
1,I wish I could have seen it!,"I was unable to view my DVD of Ballet Russes since the message on the screen said - not available in this area - or something like that. I have sent 3 Emails to Amazon to tell them I was unable to view it, and despite the fact they promise replies to Emails within 24 hours, I have heard nothing. So I am not happy at all. I will let you know how good the DVD is when you send me a copy I can view."
5,best ballet movie,For ballet lovers this is a most wonderful movie and it is so interesting to see what happens to old ballet dances and how they continue to dance.
5,Ballet Russes,Even people who do not have an interest in ballet will find this an excellent move. It is richly garnished in archival film.
5,Ballets Russes,Excellent overview. The interviews and footage of past performances are outstanding! A must for any ballet fan!
4,enjoyable documentary even for the uninterested,"""you don't need to know an arabesque from an alligator handbag to enjoy this,"" wrote one reviewer, and indeed, i didn't (and still don't), and i did. archival footage, great editing, and clean interviewing style keep this documentary of ballet groups from the 1920's to 1970's actually, unbelievably, pretty interesting. the movie does drag a little at the 3/4 point, but not unbearably. the interviews with largely fat old russians who were once lithe masters of ballet are humorous and touching."
3,"Good bargain, but visible quality loss with this release","I give ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Complete Series"" 5 stars for the animation and voice acting itself, but have to give this release 3 stars. The individual volumes were 39 episodes on 9 DVDS. This presentation is 39 episodes on 4 DVDS. The have obviously compressed the video to shrink and fit it onto less discs. There is visible quality loss with pixelation, coarser images and compression artifacts. Also the dvds are in paper sleeves, which I've actually never seen done on a store bought dvd before. It is a great bargain and most likely fine for kids or if you have a small tv. But if you are an adult or concerned about video quality, I would recommend the individual volumes named ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe Volume 1, Volume 2 and Volume 3 instead. It is a wonderful series."
4,great show bad packet,"This is one of my favourite cartoon series so i was keen to get it. when it rocked up i was impressed with the dvd quality but the packaging let me down big time!!. standard dvd packaging but the discs are contained in little paper sleeves which is kinda sh@&! but thats the only thing keeping me giving it a 5 star review..great price, great show poor packaging"
3,Check the 4th Disc,"If ur into He-Man for nostalgia or ur kids, this is a good watch. Make sure you check the 4th disc to see if it plays. I had to send it back twice to get one that works"
4,Good collection,"This is good. It consists of all episodes packaged in one DVD-case.In short, it gives you what it promises: all 39 episodes that were made, the after-episode-morals and some commentaries.There is only one thing that bugs me; and that is that they didn't include the ""He-man and the Masters of the Universe vs the Snakemen"" title-sequence for the later episodes. Every 39 episodes begin with ""I am Adam, prince of Eternia..."" etc.I always liked the ""vs Snakemen""-intro more, so i am biased of course ^^But all in all, it is an awesome show and it is good to have all episodes in one package."
4,A Must have for all He Man Fans,I happen to be a huge He man fan as I grew up in the 80s and have seen every He Man incarnation cartoon show since then. This new He Man TV Series is well produced with great storylines and animation and although it's not as good as the original animated show from the 80s it still manages to be very enjoyable. Highly recommended for all He Man fans.
5,Greatest Thing to ever Create,This is the greatest thing the creator of this series could have done. It answers a lot of questions about the mysteries of He-Man and how he was created and about the Secrets of the Sword.
5,"Fun Toon, Great Deal...","This was truly a great deal. There is every episode from this series on this DVD. My son loves it. And, there is a powerful Goddess & some powerful females as well as the males. This is a great buy and a really fun show for kids."
3,Grandchildren not watch muck.,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
2,Doesn't hold up to original He-Man,"Being a kid growing up to He-Man in the 80's, no doubt I have fond memories of that show and was excited to hear about the 2002 series. Needless to say I had high expectations, and unfortunately this series did not meet them.The show seems to try desperately to be epic, to be greater than the original 1983 He-Man. Grandiose and epic music, battles, larger than life villians. I couldn't help but feel the producers tried too hard to equal or surpass the original, and in my honest opinion fails at that goal.Mix that with the less than stellar voice acting (quite frankly I found it terrible), a childish Adam (whom by contrast, even the older young adult Adam from the original was immature, but far more mature than this whiny brat), I have to say that I must pass on this series, and I am glad it cost me only $8 at time of purchase.I honestly cannot recommend this series to anyone, but rather recommend that fans stick to the 80's series instead."
3,Good Movie,"This movie is good, but not the so called TV original. This is a remastered product and I was a wee bit dissappointed."
5,return to yesteryear,"This was a fun ""prequel"" to the iconic 80's series I enjoyed with my young children at the time. Though some of the subliminal symbolism is lost, the story lines are satisfying."
5,He Man!!,I grew up watching the original He-man and had never had the chance to see this newer version. I love it and so does my 6 year old daughter!
2,Can't play the DVD :(,"Hello Everyone,I purchased this DVD from USA but when I tried to view the DVD on my PS3 in India, it says the 'continent code is incorrect'. I tried to view the DVD on my iMac but the DVD pops out as soon as I put it inside the DVD tray. I havent tried anywhere else coz I have an iMac and a PS3. kindly Help."
2,could have been better,I got this item a few days after Christmas and put the first of four dvds in and immediately my computer froze. This being a new item I checked for scratches when I didnt find any I put it in again two minute into the first episode the thing froze up and skipped. I put it in a dvd player same thing the shows are great but the quality of my dvds was a bust next time ill buy from bestbuy that way I can just return for an exchange. buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Good show but aweful packaging,"The actual dvd set is fine, but there are packaging issues. The DVD's are packaged in paper slips/envelopes stacked on top of one another in a clam shell case. There is no paperwork or booklet. Definatley a bare bones release. Buy it if you don't already have the series, but pass if you have the previous release of the series."
3,Misleading set of performers,The Bach Tocata and Fugue seems to be a organ soloist. The jacket implies that it is performed by an orchestra. For those seeking the Tocata and Fugue with a wider range of instruments it is a disappointment.
4,A premier resource for F/A hopefuls.,"After 4 fruitless tries at the major airlines, I read this book. My next interview was a success! The selection process for the F/A position is bizarre. Your focus needs to be on not getting knocked out of the running and this book tells you how: What to wear, how to prepare, what to say. If you want a job at a major airline, interviewing without having read this book is like not having a second-language; a major handicap. You won't believe how much you didn't know!"
2,Korean version better,"I thought from the trailer it would not be that bad, but after watching the korean version, it did not even come near it. The acting wasn't that bad, but I guess i do not like remakes. But this just my opinion anyway."
3,Watchable Romantic Comedy,"""My Sassy Girl"" isn't a great movie, it was pretty predictable, and not completly empathetic, but it also isn't a bad movie, by the end the predictable outcome and plotline was one that you will look forward to and probably feel (like I did) a bit moved with some of the ending dialogue.It answers the romantic version of the question, ""What is my destiny?""It is the story of a likable nice guy nerd, and a beautiful mentaly ill girl with a subsatnce abuse problem. What makes love work, what is needed to overcome loss and adversety, what is really living? That is the crux of the story, if that sounds interesting to you you might like this movie.3 1/4 *"
5,Very Impressed,"I didnt know what to expect. I didnt know there was a korean version.I didnt know I would want to see it again as soon as it ended, because i did, I really enjoyed this movie and it just kept me smiling andlaughing and very entertaining with interesting music that fit itwonderfully.If you have to compare this to other movies in its category then its areal winner."
1,Watch the original Korean version of this movie instead,"I watched the original Korean version at least 20 times. It was with a little exaggeration in the middle, but deep and touching.The remake, I can't even bear to watch it the first time. It feels like it has a lot of ""acting"" as if they want to ""act like it is so"". It is shallow and pretentious.Try the original Korean version instead."
3,"What did you expect, really?","Ho hum.I don't think anyone expected this to be as good as the original - but I think we all wanted it to resemble it's Korean counterpart.I feel there were a little too many creative liberties taken... the story is a little bit far fetched- the acting wears a bit thin here and there- and the scenarios are entirely different. This was so distant from the Korean version that it was hard to believe the writers had watched it at all.Vaguely humorous, a good effort at least, but definitely not as good as the first. :("
1,completely lost in translation....,Wow... I loved the korean movie and I thought hey I loved it so I'll give it a chance but this was competely horrendous and it makes me sad that such a great movie was ruined. I really hope everyone just skips this movie and stick to the original.
1,Poorly Constructed,"The French director may compose the movie in an unique matter, but felt a bit messy. His transitions were too off, sometimes quick and sometimes slow. The humor was a bit off taste. At times that's what made it feel slow.And I must mention, good movies should almost never be remade."
2,OK doesn't have the magic of the original,It's an OK romantic comedy. If I hadn't seen the original may be it would have been more enjoyable - it just doesn't have the magic of the Korean version.
4,Worth waiting for the pay-off,"In the market for a romantic comedy, and adoring Elisha Cuthbert, I snagged this used at Blockbuster. I quickly realized it was more drama than comedy. But like the lead male character Charlie (winningly played by Jesse Bradford), I wanted to see what Jordan was about - and ""how the story ends"". While some found the ending contrived, I didn't see it coming - although the hint was there, if you were looking for it. Guys, the chicks will LOVE this movie. And it reminded me of how I too used to yearn for finding that kind of romance in life. Keep the kleenex handy - and not just for the girl watching this with you. It does get a little long, but it's worth the wait in the end."
1,"Sorry, but you just can't re-do a korean movie",There are just some things that do not work in the US/English- a lot of those things are the cutesy and quirkyness of Asian-ness /Korean movies. First off the original My Sassy Girl is a pretty long movie-- it develops the characters pretty well but this version is so short you can't get attached to the characters. At least watch it on a stream first before you purchase it.
2,Just Watch the Original Korean Version,"This Hollywood version of My Sassy Girl is just awful: the casting, acting, directing, editing, and plot. The American plotline should have been more adapted toward something more of 500 days of summer.If you are from the States, please watch the Original Korean My Sassy Girl and bear with the subtitles. Don't be xenophobic, there are some amazing movies out there beyond Hollywood."
1,no good,I got this CD in a timely manner it did appear new I opened it and put in in my Cd player it did not work. Then I tried my other CD player and it didnt work so I went to my computer and it still didn't work very upset.I returned it and am still waiting for my refund
4,Rare part/Cheap price--WRONG PART!!,"I have looked all over the place for this part and could only find a small number of places that sell this hub--without ABS. And this is by far the cheapest. Most other prices were above $200 and a couple were even above $300. I suggest you purchase from here, you might be searching for a while to find a price this low.--SPOKE TOO SOON--READ COMMENT"
2,No Micro Current or 6volt transformer,This product seems to only be a heated eye massager. It did not come with the 6 volt transformer so runs on batteries. Does not seem to generate any micro frequencies that I can see as is stated in the item description.
3,"2 steps forward, 3 steps back","After the brilliance of godflesh's Hymns from 2001, i had high hopes for this record. However upon listening to the first track i was quite dumbfounded, instead of progressing in a logical manner from that band and all it had achieved, we seem to have been transported back to new york no wave 1984 and the Swans' Cop album. Like the Swans, JESU have only two speeds dead slow and slower than dead. tracks 2 and 3 brightened up though as JESU at least use some contrast in their noise and unlike the early Swans haven't forgotten you need tunes if you're going to rock out. Guitars and keyboards are distorted and swirl about with distant echoey vocals. Kinda sounding here like Red House Painters put through a fuzz box. So my hopes build, and then track 7 comes along and were back in 1984 again. So to all you young ones out there who haven't heard Swans, Carbon, Live Skull et al it's not exactly groundbreaking. Let's hope the next album moves more in the right direction."
4,Super Epic Doom Industrial Rock!!!,"This is a super unique and amazing record! This is Justin Broderick's(Godflesh)new band and they are awesome. This is for people who like super heavy droning bands like Isis and Pelican or really beautiful mostly instrumental bands like Sigur Ros and Mogwai. The guitar and bass on this record mostly consist of super heavy low tuned doomy chords and riffs with a very drony futuristic feel and the slow plodding drums are simply crushing. The vocals are very dreamy and melodic, consisting of mostly short phrases that echo and repeat in waves of melody. This is a majestically heavy record. One of the best and coolest of the year!"
3,"Sonic Excellence, however....","Jesu delivers on the promise of kick ass soundscapes and bone crushing production. The 9 and 10 minute songs on this record don't seem long at all. They flow past like a solid metal album should. But the problem comes with the vocals. Every time he starts to sing it totally pulls me out of it. I know not everyone will agree with me on this one but I can't stand his voice, and his melodies are super weak. If they could pull his singing off the mix this album would be about thirty times better. Oh well."
4,Classics... very very nice.,"I love this collection. There is a freedom in the music of this era that translates into all of the individual composers represented here. One can only reap this information from a compiled set of representative musical selections, seen in a chronological collection, such as this LaserLight ""100 Masterpieces."" I particularly enjoy listening to their creations while in the photographic darkroom, mastering my own creation. My personal favorite is track number five. Thank you."
2,"Sorry,didn't like it","I was a big fan of one of the author's other books ""the book of tomorrow"" but I was so disappointed with ""where rainbows end""!! I found it so frustrating to read!! I think the story is VERY hard to believe. I felt the urge to just shake Rosee a good deal of the time because I couldn't understand why she made all of those bad decisions. A lot of times it felt like she didn't WANT to be happy.Another reason it felt frustrating was the amount of time that elapsed in the book. I felt like in real life years fly equally fast. Hard to explain.It also bothered me A LOT how absurd a lot of things described in this book were. I know it's just fiction but it should be at least credible!I still think Cecilia Ahern is a gifted writer but I just didn't enjoy this book."
5,Same Book as Rosie Dunne,"I just received this book and realized that it is the same book as Rosie Dunne, which I had just finished reading. I was pretty disappointed; the descriptions do not even tell you that- kind of mix it up so you do not realize, but it is a great book."
2,Don't get the hype...,"It was an okay novel. It was long and drawn out. I was disappointed, overall. I thought it was be something more fun and spectacular. Bad things happened to this girl her entire life. Then, at the end, the story is 100% predictable. Not your average chicklit, sadly. I expected better. I found myself bored at times. And it is very confusing to see all of this email and text messaging going on 30 years ago. Doesn't make sense."
3,It was okay....,"This was one of those books that I wanted to know the ending to.. But wanted to scream at how the characters ran around in circles.. 40 years to shrug off stubborness and admit true love? While I enjoyed meeting the other characters on the journey through out the book, if I could have shaken Rosie in the hope her stubborness disappeared, I would of."
3,Can someone please explain????,HiI really enjoyed this book but I don't understand the time frame thing. I am nearly 40 and when I was in primary school there was no instant messaging or emails. At the end of the novel Rosie was 50 so surely email didn't exist in the 70s? I am wondering if Cecilia Ahern is so young she didn't envisage a life without email. Was I too old to have read this book????I have tried to read as many reviews about the book and no-one mentions this. Perhaps the target audience is younger than me- I can remember a time when we didn't have computers and the only options were letters and phones (born in 1970). Is anyone with me on this? Would welcome anyone's comments.Cinds
3,Cut and Dry,"This book contains alot of great information for the parent who is RECENTLY SEPARATED OR DIVORCED. It gives a simple explaination how to negotiate the court system, what forms need to be filed, how to find an attorney, and how to determine child support.Unfortunately, we were already deep into our pursuit of custody of my step-daughter when I purchased this book and found the information to be too vague. We also felt the book is targeted to mothers and did not address the issues fathers have to face when seeking a change in custody.Despite the above, this book was a useful piece of reference material. We referred to the book often when we needed explanation legal terminology.All in all, the book was helpful, but not what we hoped for when we purchased it."
5,"This was one of the most accurate, in depth and easy to read","It is my belief that all legal, nonlegal and divorcing parents should read this book, it is concise,accurate and gives a decent scenario of how to prepare for all aspects of the legal system, I only wish I bought it sooner!!!"
4,This helped me get through it!,"A two-year custody battle almost made me crazy. A friend bought me this book and I wish I had it sooner! I like that it tells you how to interact with your lawyer...I fired my first one after reading this. I found the story of the divorcing couple a little unreal, but it was funny in places like when the guy has to justify his lifestyle of sleeping at odd hours so he can stay up all night working. My work hours are also weird, so I could relate."
1,Unsolicited Faxes!,I would never buy this book! They sent us a fax with no return fax number and no way to be removed from their fax list. There was no contact number of any sort. This is a very sleazy way to do business and I would never buy a book from a company who would do this!!
1,Poor quality,I used this heater for about 2 years with a 50 gallon reef tank. After 2 years it developed an internal leak which shorted out the heating coils and tripped my ground fault circuits. In addition to shorting the coils a small amount of water was leaking from the temperature adjustment knob. Because this is the only in-line heater I have found I purchased a second unit to replace the first one. After 2 months it also developed an internal leak and shorted the heating coils. I am now using an in-tank heater.If anyone knows of a good inline heater to use instead of this one please let me know.
2,"It's a good heater, it just didn't fit on the hose for my canister filter",I got a bit frustrated when I was trying to install it on my aquarium. That means I tried everything to get it on the hose. If only they made it with a 1/2 inch option all would be well. Thankfully I had one that's rated for a smaller aquarium than the one I have. That let me attach it to the tubing that came with my filter.
3,Works great but short life span.,"These inline heaters work great while they last. I had a large oscar that destroyed my in-tank heater. I found this inline heater to be the perfect choice. Removes much of the clutter from the inside of the tank as well. That being said, the heaters only seem to last roughly 2 years. My 2nd heater has recently died after 2 years. I think I will be looking for an alternative heater. I have read other reviews saying the heater lasts 2 years as well. Not sure what the deal is with the magic 2 year mark. Great price and works great, but expect to replace it often."

2,Buyer beware--overrated Vines not for everybody,"I have read so many positive reviews of this album, I had to check it out for myself. I was severely disappointed with this recording. The Vines do not live up to the hype.""Highly Evolved"" contains some pleasurable moments, but in the end it is a rote, soul-less album. I did not want to listen to this again after a couple of listens. On a positive note, they are a young, inexperienced band who have the potential to make a much more engaging recording in the future.I think another reviewer put it best: if you are in the Weezer/Nirvana camp, you might possibly enjoy this. If you are in the White Stripes/Hives/Strokes camp, you may regret buying this record. Be sure to review this at the record store or online before purchasing!"
3,Not Nirvana,"However, they are a good band. But I wouldn't use any adjectives stronger than that. It feels like they're experimenting throughout the entire album, trying to figure out what works...& never really seem to find that area that they own. It's a little bit choppy & incoherent, & you can tell they're capable of better. If you're looking for a new rock band to listen to, give this band a shot. One day they'll be amazing. Just not today."
2,Highly What?,"Imagine Oasis fronted by a screaming drugged up, drunk and crazy Scott Weiland (wait that is just like Scott Weiland). Frightened yet? Well you should be. The Vines tread a lot of ground in genres in music compared to other 'New Rock Revolution' bands, but they pull all of this off quite unsucessfully and end up looking quite inferior to their counterparts. I was reluctant to buy this album because I was afraid it would all sound like Get Free. Well guess what, most of the songs don't sound like the single. But it doesn't matter because the album is drenched in filler. The Vines try to pull off Beatles sounding tunes and Led Zeppelinish tunes but they don't mesmerize you. This album has three pretty good songs, the title track, Mary Jane, and Outtathaway. I suggest you download those songs and scrap the rest of the album."
3,Its ok...,"some good some bad. They have a great bassist, but the frontman ... My favorite track is 1969, least favorite probably Get Free. Don't compare them to Nirvana or the Beatles as thats just unfair for a young band who just released their first album. They definately borrow from these bands now, but when the Beatles came out they weren't that original, U2 was written off as some little Irish kids copying the Ramones and they would develop there own style, so bands can grow. Its an ok first album I'm not buying it, I borrowed it from a friend to check it, but if you like noise bands this is probably good for you."
2,Uneven & Not Terribly Impressive,"1/3 of this album is good (Highly Evolved, Outoftheway, Get Free, In the Jungle), 1/3 is ok, 1/3 is bad. I felt that it wasn't really worth owning."
4,"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie..oi oi oi!","Love these guys, for only three of them they have a huge sound. Are they what will save us from Britney and Shikira? Quite possibly!Reminds me alot ofthe Buzzcocks but polished.You won't be sorry on this one..Cheers!"
1,EVOLVED? Please...,"They have ""Evolved"" because they have managed to steal all the ""hooks"" and ""cool riffs"" from their predecessors. This band is a fake and if it wasn't for Nirvana, would never have been around! Do not waste you money or time with this cd. If you're looking for retro guitar rock look to The HIVES."
2,the Pixies were better than Nirvana.. and other Myths..,"For those of you planning to buy this CD based on hearing ""get free"" do not bother. download it off the net or something. because the rest of this album, (aside from possibly ""in the jungle"") is full of lush harmoniesand beatle-esque arrangements and slow songs. i was pretty dissapointed, based on how brutal ""get free""is. this really makes you appreciate a band like Nirvana. imagine someone heard ""smells like teen spirit"" and then bought the album based on that, not knowing they'd be equally blown away by the entire album. not the case here.i saw the Vines on Letterman and was blown away by their performance of get free, but get free isthe only punkish/nirvana type song on ""highly evolved"". (little wonder that track was mixed by andy wallace, who mixed ""nevermind"") if you like beatle retreads you might likethe rest of this CD, but otherwise, don't be fooled punks and grunge fans."
1,Ugh!,"Lyrics from old rock bands actually made sense. The singer for The Vines is just shouting nonsense lyrics that DON'T make any sense. I use to like this band back when I use to watch Brainwashing America and the world telivision(MTV), but I saw them playing live and they were terrible. What you hear on the CD is artificial. They are not talented nor are they the saviors of rock. I don't know of any good rock that's out today, so I would have to recommend metal(like Opeth, In Flames) or any rock and metal before the 90s."
5,nutso fudge!,"This CD was nutso fudge, i mean it was the fizzle in the shizzle. It was the homie G goat of my day! I thought all of the songs were great except for all of them!"
3,not bad...,"Kurt Cobain once said the The Beatles had done everything possible for a rock band to do and The Vines are obviously of the same opinion. They even seem to be singing in Scouse accents on the ace, grinding 'Factory'. But, of course, it's their Nirvana-meets-garage tunes that have brought them so much attention (in this strange era in which garage rock gets to appear on kids' TV). 'Highly Evolved' is still brilliant, a wrenching spasm of lurching guitars and slurred vocals; 'Get Free' sounds like a cross between two Nirvana songs, 'Negative Creep' and 'About A Girl' -- but, as Kurt would've told you, a little borrowing is no bad thing. The Vines don't deserve either the hype they've received or the suspicion. Yes, they've been lucky to get so much attention so quickly, but this is still an impressive debut."
4,Great Rocking Action,"Okay, anybody else sick of the whole ""They sound like Nirvana"" thing? Well, you should be....everyone and their mother's are writing their reviews of this album like it is a Nirvana album. It's not. I have listened the hell out of this record and, as I do hear the influence, it still sounds of it's own uniqueness. It seems that reviewers are rushing to call any new band ""The Next (fill in great past band here)!"" Christ, I bet someone will remark as to how my review reminds them of a young Ted Nugent! Fair enough...yet, I feel that the hype around this Aussie band is much larger than it need be. They rock, it's true. They are one of the best new bands to come out, it's true. I write much like Ted Nugent sweated, it's true. Buy this record because The Vines are a great band, not because you think Highly Evolved will fill your empty, deep Nirvana hole."
3,"Not Quite There, but Close","The Vines energetic vocal power and daring musicianship are hoaxes. Lead singer Chris Nicholls has a voice that saunters between whispy and full-blown growl mixed with Kurt Cobain's occasional mush-mouth that never seemed to hurt the overall delivery. I would like to say it sounds like The VInes know what they're doing, but sometimes it's very hard to tell. The album has no real rhythm or reason for it's indiviual parts, but all of the parts are entertaining and fun. This is not a very ""deep"" album or a great album either, but it's a rather promising start. I hope the initial promise shown on this record (Beatles-esque, Nirvana-like, and kinda-Pavement) can evolve into a cohesive blend. I'm waiting."
3,Give it a go...,"It seems like it was not that long ago when there was nothing exciting in rock music. I really had to try hard to find something interesting. I think now is a really different time; there is so much that is interesting out there to pick from... The Vines are contributing to this.I've only given the album a few go's but it seems that the record is at its best when it's rocking, not when it's laid back (which almost comprises half of the CD). Highly Evolved, Outtathaway, Get Free, and Aint No Room are the songs that make this band promising, and, perhaps coincidentally, they are the songs that make you wonder if this is how Nirvana would sound if they were still around today.Give the album a go because it's worth it to listen to how The Vines are aptly contributing to the interesting music scene of late.(If I had the opportunity, I would have given this 3.5 stars, instead of just 3. The ""ballads"" hold this album back.)"
4,A Rocker!,"First of all, this CD rocks... my personal favs or ""Outtathaway!"" and the famous ""Get Free"". This CD is 40 minutes of hard rock and thats what makes it good, even though Craig Nicholls vocals can become irratating and annoying which is why I only gave it four stars. Nevertheless its still a rocker! i reccomend it"
1,OUCH!,"Oh man.I dont know what to say. This band tries to be like all those new rock bands, The white stripes, the hives, the strokes, black rebel motorcycle club. And this is the worst of this brand of music. Supposedly these bands are getting back to the roots of rock and roll, but in reality htey are copying bands such as the beatles and led zepp;in and using this for on music to write simple bad music. The vines are expecially bad, they have no creativity and unorigional repeated lyrics and lines. The only reson they are popular is because of the fact that capitol records has paid for them to be over hyped by mtv, which shows them quite often. If you want some real rock and roll listen to Hopesfall and The Dilinger Escape Plan."
4,The Vines' Highly Evolved,"Great album, but not as great as the critics say it is. This band isn't the future of rock, but they are part of the movement. Let's not focus on just one band, and just enjoy some good rock and roll. I saw these guys live last night with the Music and they are just INSANE live. they played about 3 of their new songs, and I can't wait until their new record when it comes out later this year. This album is very solid, and if you see them live, you see their energy and their tendency for destroying just about everything in sight, come to life. They're the band that represents what Nirvana would be like if Kurt Cobain were still alive today. Sure they don't have as big of an impact, but they show arrogance and no mercy for pop culture today. Long live the new Rock and Roll."
4,The Vines are..,"The Vines are pretty good. With their hits, ""Get Free"" and ""Outtathaway,"" it makes this debut album good. It's a mix altogether, with grunge, punk, and rock. The Vines somewhat have a little mix with Nirvana and some of The Beatles music as well. Overall, it has a little bit of everything in this album.The album is definitely worth buying, with only a little bit of flaws. I recommend this album to anyone who likes real rock, with all the screaming, the drums, and the loud guitars."
3,Aussie Rock!...,"Rock and roll is appealing to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba! I enjoy this album. Great tunes, Big Poomba pleased with production and stars.I would reckon-mend this to Little Poomba, but not Big Poomba, BP already listened and has no money.But anyone else who likes the rock and The Rock, I would definitely reckon-mend this to you. They are better than the Strokes and the White Stripes."
4,"Nirvanaesque, but not totally","I love nirvana, theyre my favorite band, so when I heard Get free and realized it sounded like nirvana's ""negative creep"", i went home, and downloaded some songs. They are like a more ommericial nirvana, without getting to the point of pearl jam...if you know what i mean..... this band could give a kick in the [butt] to rock just like nirvana and the grunge bands did."
5,quality new music,"ok...i've read the reviews, some good and some bad, but the bottom line is...these guys are worth listening to. The Vines present an eclectic mix of melodic ballads, ska-tinged melodies and straight power chord rock. after seeing their first video on M2, i went right out and bought this CD. overall, the music is works as both great background tunes and as easily hummable and memorable songs. while the comparisons to Nirvana and The Strokes are inevitable, i believe that this Australian quartet is going to cut its own swath through the muck that is today's pop radio. and it's about time someone did."
1,dissapointed...,"after hearing 'get free' and 'outtatheway' i was impressed. But the rest of the cd [is a dissapointment]. save yourself and dont buy this cd....besides the 2 songs, the rest of the cd is horrible"
2,highly evolved? highly overrated!!,"So many good Australian bands around. You Am I, Grinspoon, Jebediah, The Living End, Powderfinger just to name a few. Why does the world pick The Vines to love? After hearing ""Get Free"" & ""Highly Evolved"" I don't blame the world for going nuts! These two songs are really good and I love them. But after getting the album, I soon came to realise that ""Highly Evolved"" really had nothing else. The other songs were OK, but sound weak & bland compared to the first two singles.And then I saw these guys live at the big day out 2003 (large australian music festival). Oh my god! the vines were absolutly terrible! They sounded weak and were easily the worst band of the day. They seriously need to work on their live performance. And whats the deal with Craig Nicolls accent? as an australian I find this quite insulting. That guy is a wanker. Listen to some real music."
2,Overhyped Garbage,"The Vines have been hailed as the second coming of Nirvana-like rock. They have been hyped as the savior which will save our musical universe from the likes of Pop Divas and Pearl Jam Knockoffs. But, this album falls short in so many ways. The first single, Get Free, is by far the most amusing song on the album, despite its simplicity, it is a good song. But, the rest of the album lacks that dynamic and is really quite boring. Some people have said they are like a combination between The Beatles and Nirvana, but they don't realize how horrible a combination that would be. The songs are mediocre, and the album itself is not as good as most people would lead you to believe. The album is good for Get Free, but that's about it. Two stars for the effort, but the last three are only earned through quality."
3,"Good effort, Luke warm music.","Far better than the hives, but not as amazing as the strokes or the white stripes. The vines first album gives testimony to nirvana and the beatles as still being the must copied bands in rock history. Don't get me wrong, I think this cd is ok, but man is it chopped full of borrowed tunes. My personal favorite track is factory. This song being of course heavily influenced by the beatle's. In the jungle is another noteable track. If the vines stop sounding so much like there influences and start to get more original without losing their hard loud sound. They'll be around for sometime."
5,"Highly Evolved, indeed!","This is a band that is going to change everything... again. The Vines have moved beyond all things that have been produced in recent years, taken the raw emotions of rage, glory, hope, and curiosity and whipped it into a potent mix of hard rockin, groin engorging, soul flying MUSIC! With that first bang of 'Highly Evolved', you know you're in for something good. The songs flip from dirty and edgy (the title track,'Outtathaway','Get Free','Ain't No Room') to tender and trippy ('Autumn Shade','Homesick',and 'Mary Jane') all the while demanding a listen and kicking your guts. I fell in love with Craig Nicholls while listening to his words, his melodies, and his voice which travels from shreading to soaring.This album is amazing. Every cut has its own strength and personality presented through the visual lyrics and sounds. Nicholls is beyond my wildest musical fantasies, and I can't get enough of The Vines!"
3,Not that great,"This disc has two sides to it -- the fast songs are okay, and the slower songs stink. The fast songs are somewhat catchy, though the guitar solo playing is primitive... not primitive in a good Neil Young-esque way, but primitive as in a 8th-grade still learning way. The singer screams in some of the fast ones, though it's better when he sings, since there doesn't seem to be much a reason to scream. The slower songs aren't catchy, there's nothing interesting musically, and the singing is annoying Oasis-like."
3,"Not the ""future of rock""","I bought ""Highly Evolved"" in submission to all of the hype that surrounded it. The ""future of rock""? Hardly. That's not to say it's a really bad album. I just didn't find it to be that innovative or break any new ground. The best tracks are ""Get Free"" and ""Factory"" which kinda reminds me of ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" from Abbey Road. I'm not sure I'd pay full price for this, but if it's in the used CD bin, it's worth picking up if only to disprove the hype. Average."
5,J,"Great album! Nirvana and the Beatles are definite influences. If you like these bands, you'll like The Vines."
1,Unevolved Nirvana,"This album is nothing more than a poorly done rehash of Nirvana, Radiohead, and the Beatles. While all three of those are defintely respectable, The Vines however,are not. The music is pretentious and the band leader, Craig Nichols, has been nothing but a clueless lout that feels like it is his duty to be the new CrAzY guy in rock-n-roll. Instead of being a loose cannon he is just another loose nut. I give it one star because the current single Come In is a decent revision of Nirvana's Negative Creep. When it comes to spending your money, save it for real rock-n-roll bands not this."
4,presidents of the united states of america?,"pretty good album.but try listening to ""highly evolved"" and presidents of the united states of america's ""tiki god"".The vines shouldn't have ripped them off"
1,"Outtathaway, indeed","What the heck is wrong with this band? The lead singer's voice is a weird, sandpapery yelp, and he is incoherant at all times. I saw them on the MTV awards or some other crap, and they were awful. And what are they saying in Outtathaway? I'm pretty sure I heard 'I'm comin' off that negr* sound' and that might very well be what they said, since most of the song is about people being 'different' and them not caring about saying things 'out of line cause they don't believe in time'. Of course, I've gotten different versions of the lyrics from a few different places since no one seems to agree on what the heck they're saying. OutKast should hunt them down and kick their skinny white asses. And why did OutKast or whichever black person owns that 'Ms. Jackson' song sell it to THEM? Way to sell out, man."
1,nirvana number three,"the vines are a copy of nirvana god could they take any melodies from nirvana and try to make them their own, my answer is noi bought this album listen to ten minutes then turned it off and went and got a refundedcraig nicholas the wacky lead singer trying to outspace kurt cobain as the hectic singer but failing miserbly and looking stupid god he can't sing he just screams...and his lyrics well i don't need to say a word...just because he wears a green cardy got the same face as kurt and he thinks he's a genius HMMM no to be a genius you got to have talent and craig you have no talentthe vines are as bad as silverchair at being a nirvana copycat band"
2,Where's da true rock these days??,"Unlike Creed 'n Bizkit, whose middle name is ""innovation,"" these guys just don't carry on the torch of rock 'n roll like they lay claim to. Now, don't get me wrong, this record does have its moments of Seattle-like soundz. However, the lameness on this record far outweights the rockin' moments, like when they try to be the next Beatles or something. Trust me, music fans, if they want to try and emulate anybody, it shouldn't be the overrated Beatles. Rather, they should take a cue from strong-rock gods Creed 'n Bush, and mold their sound to fit New-Age grunge, a favorite genre of mine.Another concern I have is this: have these Australian rockers been on TRL yet? If not, I hesitate to take them seriously. Remember this motto: ""if they ain't talked to Carson Daly, then they ain't the real deal."" Steer clear from bands who don't frequent TRL's show, either via countdown or live performance.Alright, I'm outta here, yep, yep. Peace Out!!"
3,The Vines,"The vines are taking the charts and hitting america with all they got. but no one knows they don't got much. half the songs on the cd are pretty good. good enough to make them a top band in the rise of indie rock. but they sound too much like other bands. People keep saying the lead singer, Craig Nicholls, sounds like Kurt Cobain, but he really only sounds like him on their single, Get Free, which is an excellent song. half of the other songs, he sounds like John Lennon. even some of their songs could pass as beatles tunes. that's not that good though. it's not that it's bad that they sound just like the beatles it's bad that they sound just like another band. it takes away from their originallity. But they do hit a couple sweet spots with their title track, Highly Evolved and their leading single, Get Free. The album is too unbalanced. it just goes from upbeat to slow over and over again. but if you really like the beatles and really like indie rock then buy this cd. 7/10"
2,so-so,"anytime a band gets hailed as saviors of rock, they're bound to let you down. this album is 80% hype, 20% quality. listen to BONA ROBA (bonaroba.net) for some straight up rock n roll, minus the hype."
4,THE VINES REVIEW,"The vines are my favorite out of the new ""old style"" bands. The hives, the strokes, the white stripes. There are some real catchy song and then there are some soft melodies. I would give it a 4.5, its hard to give out 5s b/c then they are perfect. While they are a good band there is always space for improvement.I really do enjoy it tho. Vocals-4 edgy Guitar-heard but not well enough Drums-i dont remember them Lyrics-5 very good but not meaningful really just fun"
1,Is this band supposed to be great?,The Vines have a groovy bassist. I'll give them that. Other than the cool bass lines there is not much to say. The melodies are so similar to the beatles that hardly any credit can be given to The Vines for originality.The Vines blend in some grunge tones into their music. That is when it gets annoying. The singer will be singing then he'll burst out screeching like he has a hot coal in his underwear. The singer often sounds too similar to Marilyn Manson. That is not a good thing if you want to be a indie rock band.The Factory is the only song that I enjoyed. I will warn you not to buy this cd because these guys just arn't top notch. Don't be a sheep that gave into all the marketing tricks.
3,not impressed...,"The vines were among the few names (strokes hives white stripes) that were supposed to be reviving the rock and roll era. now whereas i thoroughly enjoyed 'is this it?' by the strokes and have listened and enjoyed a number of hives songs, this band fails to stand-out as anything remotely interesting let alone original. i do listen to a lot of music, so my expectations for a band so hyped were quite high. Beatles (Lennon in 2nd track) and Nirvana influences do spring up in these songs, but the a lack of distinction in the lead singers voice and his tendency to scream the notes dont seem justified and can sound annoying.im sure this album will be a mainstream success judging from the reviews here, but i just wasn't convinced by what i heard on this album."
2,Silverchair II,"Australia can do better than this. If you're buying this album for the single ""Get Free,"" get albums by groups like Girls vs. Boys first; they had a similar but superior sound in the early 90's. I'm all for this rock revival with groups like The Hives and The Strokes but this is not it."
2,"Saviours of Rock, hUh?","Calling a band the ""saviour of rock"" a strong thing to say, and in this case, it's also ridiculous... not to say this band is bad, because they are not. But I didn't find their music that appealing or anything that I could really call fantastic. ""Get Free"" definently interested me and suited my tastes, but the rest of album just didn't appeal to me nor amaze me in any sort of way. However, I'm sure there are people out there who will like this album more then I did.Lots of bands have been popping up, and if you don't particurally like The Hives, then listen to The Strokes. They are, simply, a flat out awesome band and my favorite of the bunch."
1,HA HA HA HAH AH,"oh my god. if you like this album, then i'm sorry.in fact, i don't know why i'm even writing to you. you are beyond hope, and i don't think communication is truly possible.so i'm giving up. i'm abandoning you to the hordes of others like you who listen to the worst music ever made."
4,music freak,"This album is definately a great! But, don't be fooled by the comparisons that seem to be tagged to this band. More than any others - this band sounds almost exactly like Redd Kross - either their Neurotica or Phaseshifter CD's. Sometimes the Vines sounds vaguely like Stone Temple Pilots and also have a bit of a Beatlesque feel with a punk attitude - but seriously - Redd Kross did it first. If you like the Vines or you get interested enough to by their GREAT CD - check out Redd Kross too - they deserve it - they started it!!!"
3,The future?,"""Highly Evolved"" is nothing new or exciting, especially since this format of pop-grunge has been done. (See Stone Temple Pilots...) Songs like ""Highly Evolved"" and ""Get Free"" have a feel that they've yet to be finished. Don't let ""Get Free"" scare you though because the single definately does not set the tone for the album. Craig Nicholls likes to change it up with mellow pop rockers like ""Autumn Shade"" and ""Mary Jane."" My favorite song on this debut album would have to be ""Outtathaway!"" which is a catchy tune with loud vocals. ""Sunshinin'"" is a throwback to the Beatles era of music and a very good song, worthy of being the next single. If you are interested in the Vines, borrow a copy before you buy."
4,dont me misled,"the vines are good, dont get me wrong, but they arent punk, or post punk. they are indie, and this cd only has about 3 ""upbeat"" songs on it including get free, non of the other songs sound like that song at all. they are more slow and mellow and relaxing in the sun on vacation kind of music, some have a cheerfull beatlesesque feeling to it. so if your thinkin they are all punk sounding like the hives or the white stripes your wrong, but they r still good."
2,Cookie Cutter Corporate Rock,"I heard the raves about The Vines (on the radio, Rolling Stones article) and decided to purchase this album. I read how the lead singer wants to compare himself to Kurt Cobain. Well, this album is nothing like Grunge Rock. And the lead singer is no Cobain. The Vines do not sound like a garage band. They sound and appear to be an exact replica of what producers and record execs want--clean, boring, pseudo-angst driven. But then again, the album's graphic designs should hint at that. What do you think the target age group here is?? There's none of Grunge's sensitive introspection and emotion here. This album as well as the whole new 'Brit-Pop sound' is a complete laugh, and so are the comparisons to a former Northwestern Grunge music.If you want to listen to garage-style music, try something else. If you want Grunge, try the Nixons, Replacements, Vaselines, Melvins, Alice, Tad, Mudhoney, Sebadoh, Soundgarden, Nirvana, etc., not this."
1,ACK,"Are you kidding me? I picked this cd up because I heard it was similar to The Hives. Boy, what a mistake. Ok, Get Free is tolerable, but the rest is garabage. They'll be gone in few months, if that."
4,The essence of grunge rock... or is it?,"The Vines rock. They are not the best garage band to ever cross the music scene, but they do capture some of that essence in their diversity of songs, not all of which are grungey. I particularly love the guitar riff in the middle of 'Homesick'. It's just a tale of yearning in itself."
2,"Cool, a new Nirvana greatest hits?","Oh, my bad, it's just another wannabee. Please don't buy into the hype. I did, and am regretting my ...loss. I bought this album without a listen, and I vow never to do that again. I could have popped Bleach into the CD player and had a much more enjoyable, and original listen, not to mention saved [money]. Before arguing, please listen to ""Blew"" on Bleach, and then ""Get Free"", the first single by the Vines, and then talk to me.This is not terrible song writing, but just not original, and not all that exciting. The future of rock 'n roll?, I hope not. In the same order, I spent [money] on the EP by Interpol, and found much more to enjoy in those 3 songs than the entire album by the Vines. Sorry to be the rotten apple. If you don't own it, i'd recommend Bleach by Nirvana before buying this one."
1,Derivative nonsense,"I had heard this band a few times on the radio and wondered who turned the dial back to 1995, and that was before the hype onslaught began.But seriously, this band is energetic, but far from original. I have alot of CDs from bands who do this better. Besids who wants rock that is so over-produced. That is one fancy garage they play in. From this past year, if you want something new AND good, check out McLusky or The Hot Snakes."
3,not bad,"Sure, the music on this cd is outstanding, but I think Glen should stick to just guitar playing. I didn't really care too much for the vocals. I think he should have hired a singer instead of doing it himself. That's just my opinion. Obviously, most of the reviewers here don't agree with me on that. Other than the vocals, this cd is great. I particulary liked the cover of Rolling Stones' Paint It Black. Glen has always been a great guitarist, but he's no Tim Owens."
3,not exactly a classic Priest album,"I got to say when I bought this and looked at the vocals, I couldn't believe Tipton was doing the singing. He can't even sing good backround vocals. Tipton is a great guitar player in his influence in Priest is evident. However I like the input from Halford and Downing more than Tipton. Even so if your a diehard Priest fan you probably will enjoy this."
3,I don't get it.....,"The only reason I can see Glenn doing this is because he had a singing urge he needed to take care of, because the music itself is nothing we haven't heard from him in Priest.That he is a great guitar player is unquestioned, but this album doesn't show off his talents any better than, say, Painkiller. Glenn's guitar tone is horribly digital on this, which he unfortunately carried on to Judas Priest after this release.How K.K. agreed to this tonal diarrhea is beyond all reason.And the vocals...just stick to guitar playing, Glenn. He's not a ""bad"" singer, but if he was meant to be a full-time vocalist he would BE a full-time vocalist.At any rate, if you're a Priest fan that is wondering whether or not to buy this, just listen to Demolition. If you like that, then you'll like this. This is basically the same record with worse singing."
5,Josh Wink at his best!,"I think that this album is excellent. It has that catchy beat while keeping you moving. His mix of ""When The Funk Hits the Fan"" is smooth, and even though this is one of my favorite songs ever, Wink reminds me of why it is. I recommend this to everyone!"
4,Fonky Yeh Yeh,"This mix CD is a great example of the current tech-house aesthetic, merging insistent house-y beats with minimalism and old-school Detroit flourishes. All the tracks here are class, maybe too much so; in 1999, it would have been nice to see some of these artists doing something a bit more radical. Having said that, the opening track is a keeper - awesome dubbed out echoes creating a great sense of space. From there, Wink slowly ups the energy, working in hints of Detroit, disco and trippy vocals lifted from his own ""Sixth Sense"" ona couple of the tracks. The mixing is one of the most impressive things about this CD - Wink handles the records with consummate professionalism. Transitions often last for several minutes, and there is creative use of filters and effects. Overall, quality product, but still product. For seasoned tech heads only."
2,too soft,"Too much of a disco vibe. Doesn't deliver on the promise of ""Higher State of Consciousness."""
3,"Eisenhorn, by Dan Abnett","The Eisenhorn Omnibus is a great deal for fans of the 40k series, and of the books. It constitutes a very high quality dark science/fantasy fiction. At the same time, it is very dry, and I found myself unable to get through it. I read to the end of the first book (the Eisenhorn arc is a trilogy), and put it back on the shelf, where it has sat for quite some time, waiting for me to try again.What I did read, I liked. I just felt that, after three hundred pages of Eisenhorn, there was no reason to carry on.I'm not a huge fan of 40k--frankly, I like the Eldar more than the Space Marines and Imperium at large, but the majority of the Black Library's fiction deals with humanity.As I've said, if you're into the 40k fiction, it's worth it. If you're only tangentially interested, as I am, it's a crap shoot."
2,Dull 40K universe,I read through the entire 3 novels contained in the book and i have to say that I was not impressed. My first foray into 40K novels was the Ultramarines Omnibus which I enjoyed immensely so i decided to expand my library. After going through the entire book I was extremely disappointed at the lack of pull it had compared to Graham McNeils book.The characters in the story were pretty lame and really lacked polish. One part i particularly disliked was when he was using these terms to describe sword techniques. Instead of illustration an intense battle scene he uses these abstract jargon to replace the action which really sucked the excitement from the event.
4,this isn't a review,never read it-a young relative idicated he liked it and somehow my name popped upon this--no more to say
1,Great book! A MUST BUY,Bought it! Shipping was fast and smooth. Book in perfect condition. 10 Dollar price tag for such an amazing book is a great deal! Eisenhorn is as thick as it is good. You have simply no real reason to not buy it...
4,Worth your time,"The characters are great. The stories are great. The ending is even kind of strangely touching, especially for the 40K setting. I'm not sure what else to say about it except that I can't wait to read his Ravenor novels now."
5,Jedis on roids,"If you like the idea of jedis battling truly DARK forces, then you'll love this book. Hands down one of the best Warhammer 40k books."
4,GREAT BOOK!!!,"I unfortunately made the mistake of reading the ""Ravenor Omnibus"" first so that kinda gave me a distorted view of Eisenhorn, however, despite this it was still on of the best books I've ever read. The story lines were second to none, and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire way through the book. Character development was unbelievable and I actually felt like I knew them. Dan Abnett is in my opinion one of the greatest writers of our time, and I have enjoyed every one of his books I have read. If you enjoy a good story, and love the world of Warhammer 40k READ THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Defective Wranglers,The middle of the right front pocket was riveted to the right pant leg. The jeans were unwearable. These pants were definitely defective.
2,Despereaux,"The story was a little slow and boring at times. The animation was good, but it is not one I would watch over and over again."
3,The Tale of Despereaux,"Cute little mouse story. Fans of medieval animated animal stories should enjoy it. A small mouse shows that no matter of size one can exhibit honor, courage, and chivalry. He is unlike other mice, for they are taught to be timid and to stay away from humans. Despereaux meets a human princess after a death in the family and tries to console her. The kingdom is falling apart, so it is up to Despereaux to come up with a way to restore hope. I recommend as a family rental before buying. Several kid friendly features including a game. Good quality DVD and decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catchRedwall - Season One.CA Luster"
3,This soup has some Racist Spices in it!Rat World's wearing Fess etc,"Everything looked Ok till it showed the Rat World after the Peaceful Mice World. Rat World's rats had fes in their heads, the music is oriental, like egypt or saudi, cobra snake dancers while the Mice World had Central European or France. This movie is not for kids and very Humiliating the Middle Eastern Part of the world."
1,2:35 you will NEVER get back of your life,"In the beginning, there was soup, and it was good.That sums up the grand opening of the entire movie. A physically deformed mouse rebells against a society and creates his own generic way; all without the means of any plot. It just unfolds.... moment by painful moment. True, it could have been worse with a chorus and a kick-line, but I believe myself to be sufficiantly scarred.This film is full of brain-washing ideas for a rated G movie. I would not show it to children-- ever. Soup is, in this movie, ""better than Christmas,"" the portly ""ugly"" characters wind up together isolated out of town by the end of the film, NONE of the females seem to have the ability to read and rely on male mice to do this for them, and of course, all father figures in this film have abandoned their children in this film. In a word: this movie is warped."
3,not much impressed....the blue ray was good,the 3 stars are for the film being not so impressive..atleast to us...my 3 year old got too excited but soon got bored ...but the quality of the blu ray was good but filmwise not much impressive.
2,cute movie,this was a cute movie in my opinion but i think Hollywood is running out of movie ideas. we need some better story lines like nemo and lion king
2,Pinochio and Bolt set the blu ray standard,"With Pinochio and Bolt coming out in blu-ray/DVD combo packs I'm goin to support them.I have one blu-ray player, and a dvd player in my laptop. I want to watch it in both places and I want the best qualit. The new combo packs give me that for the same price! a dollar less actually.Let's make blu-ray successful. Gimme Combo packs!The movie is cute, the story is ok, I give the movie 4 stars but won't be buying it until I canget a good price on it used, or they release a cobo pack."
4,Cute kid movie!,"Fun and engaging! The plot is unique and fun, it is rare to see a truely fresh movie that the kid will enjoy!"
3,A little boring,"The whole family got bored with this movie. My 4 year old son stopped watching it about 1/3rd way through.It's a cute story, just not enough content. It's like a short story book turned into a film. This story would make an awesome 20-30 page story book."
5,Widescreen DVD - Tale of Despereaux,"Bought this movie for my husband for father's day! Unable to find it at local stores, so ordered it from Amazon. Received within a week and my husband and I love it. The unique animation in the movie is wonderful as is the story and the voices used for the rich characters.Thanks for having exactly what my husband wanted and what we wanted!J Talley"
1,B for boring,"This was one of the most boring kids movies I have ever seen, the movie was really dark and we couldn't see the first half, just shadows, dialog, boring, characters boring, plot, was there a plot? Don't waste your time or money on this video"
2,Just Bad,"I hate to say it because little Despereaux is so cute but this movie is bad. I have most of these cartoon movies that come out and I don't want this one. The story line just doesn't make too much sense. The lessons are confusing as are the characters and lines. Using Matthew Brodrick, or whatever his name is, was a bad choice for voice of a mouse child. It's just creepy. I would never let my kid watch this movie and I don't even have a kid."
2,tedious.,rent Ratatouille instead!my young son got bored in the theater and asked to leave (thank god).no narrative drive whatsoever. has a tedious narrator who tries to explain the movie to you.looks really bad next to some of Pixar's gems.
4,Good family entertainment.,Enjoyed this with my grandsons! Did note the reference to the kingdom thinking Christmas was not as important as the soup!That is so typical of Hollywood and unnecessary.
3,"A GOOD STORY, BUT IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT WANTS TO BE!","I was a little disappointed in this film only because it seemed a little too adult for this type of film. The animation is excellent even if a bit dull and the voice acting is very good although not that inspired. I found the story to have a great message, but not enough excitement and sharp wit....something I've grown accustomed to as of late with so many top notch animated films. It's not a bad film, but there are certainly much better animated films and also many worse! It's a very good story, but I doubt it will keep the little ones attention."
1,Read the Book Instead,"This film does no justice to the book. In fact, the book and the movie have only the names of the characters in common. The book is lovely, written with such beautiful language, imagery, and character development. The movie is stark, choppy, and dark.Please read the book by Kate DiCamillo instead. Better yet, read it aloud to your child. You will be swept up in the story and feel good at the end."
3,"Believe me, its not a copy of Ratatouille","The movie starts as one about food and rats, so I straight away thought about Ratatouille, but the storyline quickly moves to tale about mice and rats, and how one mouse redeems a rat who actually prefers the company of humans over rats. Matthew Broderick plays the main role, and like his other recent movies, what we have is an inoffensive family movie that blends some comedy with some action and some drama. The animation is respectable, but nothing breath-taking. The soundtrack is generic, with some good orchestral music when Despereaux is reliving scees from a fairy tale book. Otherwise, nothing outstanding. All in all, an OK movie."
2,"Story? Interesting. Animation, BLEGH!","The plot of this movie was quite interesting...I know the book is popular. I won't go into the disturbing scenes where the princess is about to be eaten alive by rodents, or the seriously depressing parts, I'll just say the animation is terrible! The mice look...OK but the humans have ultra skinny, long faces and look really, really ugly! Every time they were like, ""oh, the princess is so beautiful,"" I was thinking, who? the girl with the thin head? I was really disappointed in the animation, and it just wasn't a very good movie."
3,Did not live up to expectations,"Did not live up to expectations, hard for an adult to sit through and watch."
1,"Great book, horrible movie","I am a big fan of this children's story, so the movie was a major disappointment to me. I hated the changes that were made to the story, and I didn't care for the added violence. The story is a good one as is, and didn't need added movie violence. The changes that were made were not necessary and annoying."
5,Great,"I love animations and I have several. This is right up there with my favorites. Great story that teaches no matter what you look like, you can be GREAT."
1,Dull movie,"As our kids are fans of great mouse movies like Flushed Away, I thought they would like The Tale of Despereaux. The kids, my husband and I were all bored, bored, bored and we couldn't even watch to the end. Don't waste your time on this one."
4,"Good story, lots of action","It was pretty intense for my 7 year old who wondered if everyone was going to be o.k. a little too much, but the rest of us enjoyed the story, laughed some, and would recommend it."
4,WHAT A CUTIE!,CUTE STORY. I'm not sure it is that good for kids under 5. Most of them 3-4 year olds seemed to lose interest. But good for 5 and up.
1,"Would give it no stars, were that an option.","My 5 year old daughter and I saw this last night in a hotel room. I read the story's synopsis and saw it was rated G and thought that, at the very least, it would be entertaining to her. It was dreadful. Despereaux really becomes a bit player among other story lines that are all dark and sinister. When the princess is bound in the dungeon about to be eaten by rats, I really could not believe it! I also thought (and I have never read the book, so perhaps I'm wrong) that some of it was a rip off from ratatouille...the appreciation of the soup, the rat guiding the human, and the one head evil rat, to my mind, was a rat version of the snooty food critic Anton (?). At any rate, this movie literally made my daughter cry and she spent a good part of it under her blanket. I ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN."
2,Disappointing to a Children's Movie Fan,"We have a 7 year old daughter who is usually glued to the TV when we watch the newest released DVDs. With The Tale of Despereaux, she was finding excuses to get up and do something in another room. I had to tell her to ""watch your movie!"" I have never read the book, and I am sure it must be a lot better than the film. Nothing really happens in the film until the very end when there is a little action. and Despereaux, supposedly the main character, isn't often even in the film. I found they tried to throw in aspects from the book but didn't give them enough background or fleshed the ideas out enough, resulting in a very fragmented film. It seemed like so many elements should have just been left out instead of haphazardly trying to fit them in. So many things were left unexplained that I was like ""what the?"" the whole time. There are better new Kid's releases out there for sure like Bolt, or Kung Fu Panda that left us a much more satisfied movie watching family."
3,Arrived broken,"This teakettle is not at all as nice as the ones sold several years ago, all of the materials are thinner and lighter and the the entire teakettle is smaller. I bought the Copco Mirage to replace the one I purchased about 6 years ago. The old one was still beautiful and the perfect size on my electric stove's small burner. It looked and worked as well as the day I bought it. Unfortunately it got ruined when it was accidently left empty and the burner was still on. The new one arrived broken, a large chunk of the plastic handle near the spout was broken off and rolling around in the box. It looked significantly smaller and cheaper than the one I had. I purchased a Chantel kettle and am sending this one back."
5,Quick and Easy,"I am pleased with the Zio CompactFlash media reader. It is simple and easy to use, out of the box. The benefits of reading the card directly into the computer from the card without having to attach the camera itself include:1) I'm not using up the camera battery2) I don't need the optional AC power cord (a significant savings)3) It is easy to share the contents of the FlashCard with friends without having to give up the use of the camera while they are downloading the pictures to their PCI certainly recommend this product for any digital camera user."
4,All parents see some of their child(hood) in Dennis,"""Dennis the Menace"" is one of the most endearing comic strips because no matter how good their child is, each parent experiences some of the behaviors of Dennis. Furthermore, nearly every neighborhood has a grumpy old Mr. Wilson; in my neighborhood it was Mr. McConnell. A boy on a mission, Dennis is a child that is on the extreme of the spectrum of behavior, yet he is also endearing, because at times he does things that melt your heart. While no child is all bad, all children are bad at times so we can enjoy Dennis from a distance and see our children and relive some of the more memorable events from our childhoods."
3,Incomplete overtures,"I share the other customer's opinion that this CD is priceworthy. But any Telemann-lover should be aware of the fact that the Telemann-overtures on this CD are all incomplete versions, missing 1 (TWV55:D07, TWV55:F3) or 2 (TWV55:D15 and D18) parts. Besides, D15 is originally scored for 3 oboes instead of trumpets. But D07 is not available thus far in an other performance on CD, so that makes this CD unique anyway.."
1,Beware of the worst Telemann CD ever,"Yes, it is. Horror piled on horror: all of the overtures are incomplete, the order of movements is changed, standard repetitions are not played, and to top it all off, the three oboes in 55:D15 (TWV numbers? Who needs them?) are shamelessly, and ridiculously, replaced by three trumpets. I only keep the thing because 55:D7 is still not available elsewhere. Even if the soloists are good, there is no point in praising them. Telemann is my favourite composer, and to see him treated like this makes my bile rise. - Cheap it may be, but please don't buy this trash CD."
4,Good for beginners,"As a rank beginner, I found this book helpful. The instructions and pictures are easy to follow. The only drawback for me is that the authors seem to subscribe a bit to the ""no pain no gain"" theory. I ignored that and started out with no weight but my own body weight, and one set, and worked slowly from there. I have been improving and after six weeks can feel the difference. I find twice a week easy to stick with, too."
2,Unimpressive,"I thought this might be a vinyl dye (like VHT's products for vinyls claim to be), but no, actually it's just, more or less, a flexible vinyl paint.I used it on some textured, black motorcycle plastics. It left them shiny, rather than their original satin finish, and spotted with occasional runs and defects.I've been extremely happy with Plasti-Kote's acrylic lacquer, and have gotten very high quality finishes from them, so I'm no newbie when it comes to aerosols. But Plasti-Kote Vinyl Color left me disappointed.Update: it's been about a year since I applied this to my motorcycle luggage. It's peeled off in large chunks. Looks awful."
2,Unsatisfied,"The material was very cheap and not lasting. For the amount of money, it could have been a little more durable. The color was kind of pretty.States the bottom is a thong - Incorrect - It is a string bikini. I felt like was was misled and paid too much for what it actually turned out to be."
3,Maybe not the best choice if looking...,"I bought this in the hopes of reviewing college algebra. This is a pretty light weight look at the basics of high school level algebra, but serves that purpose well."
5,Forgotten Algebra,"Looking in the public library for an algebra book for my daughter to use as a review for an ACT test I checked this book out. I was so impressed that I purchased a copy to always have to refresh a memory or teach from.This book is written exactly as a book should be, easy to read and understand thus enabling one to completely self teach. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to learn algebra or needed help remembering what they had forgotten."
3,There are TONS of errors in this book!!!!!,"I was real excited about this book because I havent taken math in over three years. I liked the simple explanations and refreshing review. There is plenty of space for practice and just enough problems to work so that the book is not jumbled with practice.The only gripe and I think this is important one , is that their are tons of errors! I am only on page 53 and I have found at least 6 errors. If you don't know your algebra or dont remember much you can be misled in your learning. I think this deters in the learning of the material. It also makes the explanations and answers confusing."
4,A Great and Helpful Book,This is a very helpful book. I'm only fourteen and I'm very interested in looking into a career that had to do with mathematics. I had never even delt with algebra before so I knew absolutely nothing about it. I bought the book to prepare for mathematical courses in High School and it made a huge difference. The book gives many examples that help you understand the different algebraic concepts. It explains mostly anything that you could need to know. The only part in this great book that wasn't so good was when they got into the higher chapters with the high level of difficulty they didn't explain the concepts well enough to have a totally thorough understanding. Other than that the book was very helpful and now I can go on to harder subjects in mathematics with confidence.
5,I'm not afraid of algebra anymore!,"I have been dreading taking a college math class for years because I felt I had never learned algebra, and what I had learned, I'd long since forgotten. This book has undone years of fear! I've been working in the book for about a week and a half, and I'm almost a third of the way through. I feel very confident now because this stuff is acutally makes sense! Thank you, Barbara Lee Bleau!"
5,If you need your algebra back like yesterday....,"If you are studying for:* SAT* GED* Math placement testsor you need to brush-up on your algebra for work (or because you never understood it in the first place!), I HIGHLY recommend this book.If you are sitting there right now thinking to yourself ""...if I don't learn this stuff now I'm in a world of hurt..."", and looking for the right learning tool out of desparation, buy this book.Good stuff, highly recommended!"
4,Perfect for refreshing your skills!!,"I found this book perfect for refreshing algebra skills 17 years after my last math course! It brought back to mind everything I learned, and the explanations are clear and concise. Moving forward to calculus hasn't been a challenge at all now that I remember my algebra. Highly recommend!"
4,Forgotten Algebra,Excellent refresher course. Highly recommended to brush up on your algebra. If it had more practice problems I would give it 5 stars.
2,Truly forgotten,"I must be honest and say that I threw in the towel after working through half of this book. The many errors led me to believe that the author may have actually ""forgotten"" some of the math herself. That said, the book gets two stars because of the fact that it forced me to think critically and prove my work, errors and all."
1,Terrible edition,"The idea behind this book is great but the book itself is frustrating with how many typos and errors are in the book. By unit 12 I had given up in frustration. One of the solutions midway into the problem they forgot the superscript on one of the powers, another they changed the problem from the one written in the back to a completely different power. One of the lessons had 15 written problems to do and 16 answers in the back of the book. And yet another, and my favorite, ""Do these 16 problems by yourself"" Just to have them skip flat out making a problem 7!"
2,Really hard way of finding the answers,"I don't know how many times I thought to myself 'I don't remember learning it this way at all'. I have graduated HS about 15 years ago, and need to clept out of the math classes at college. I was recommended this book by my adviser. I became frustrated at how they came to their answers as I found it very complicated. I ended up going on You tube for some more tutorials and saw a much easier way of coming to the solution."
2,Good to jog your memory but be leary of answers given. (3rd ed included),"Background:I am using this book after being out of formal schools for 10 yrs now. The local college suggested it for its coverage of the subjects covered for the math placement test.Pros:Math in general was a strong suit in HS and with the help of this book it has been like riding a bike. I like the way Barbara makes the review process more challenging and covers the pertinent rules with good examples and explanations.Cons:There are too many errors in the Examples and the Exercises that really kicked me in the confidence. On the bright side, I worked 3 times as many problems that I generated myself or found online to exercise what I learned and checked all my answers.Conclusion:This book did a good job of reviewing critical rules and special cases, the lessons were clear but it was very time consuming having to double check if your answers were actually right because of a lack of confidence in the books answers."
2,disorderly presentation,"Even though this CD has some helpful ideas for learning French, it is put together without paying enough attention to detail. The same explanations of liasons and other pronuncation practices are repeated over and over again with different lessons. In one of the intermediate interviews (third step, Jean-Luc Sibiude), one hears the phone ring and an individual in the background swearing. This is very careless editing (or lack of it)and is not the professional quality one would expect."
1,Fake?,"I still have my 1.6oz bottle of Lacoste pour homme that I purchased from Macy's 6 years ago, and the difference between that and what I received (I got two 3.3 oz) is like night and day. The original I have from 6 years ago is strong, and wonderful smelling. I only need one spray and I can easily smell it on all parts I tagged. I tested both bottles I received against my original, and I can barely smell either of them at all even after three sprays. There's a lingering trace of what Lacoste pour homme is supposed to be, but it is so weak (like it's watered down heavily) that I am better off not wearing it at all.I contacted the seller today and if I hear back, I'll update.In the meantime, I'll check to see if Macy's is still selling it and if it still smells like it's supposed to."
5,Lacose Pour Homme,Great smelling and lasts a long time. Shipping was faster than what they said. I think that this is one of the best smelling colognes out there. I will be buying this again when I need more. Note: Its only 3.3oz not the 3.4oz they advertise. But thats no big deal.
4,Exactly what I was looking for..,"My husband loves this perfume. I bought him the set a couple of years ago at Macy's. We've tried to purchased it again at Macy's but I'm thinking it's discontinued, so when I found it online, I knew I had to surprise him with it for his birthday. He loves it. It got here right on time. The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not the Eau De Parfum one. I can't seem to find that one. But I guess it's the scent that counts."
3,"Good, but lasts for very little","Scent smells good enough, nothing extraordinary but fairly good. Now, it lasts for.....an average of half an hour, with the normal dosage. Three hours later, no traces of perfume can be found not even in your neck, where it is supposed to last for longer. Scent simply fade away and disappear."
4,Bottle came hot!!!,"I just received my bottle today. I took it out of the package and it was hot! Now those of you who are picky with how you store your cologne know that you don't keep them in extremely warm places because it will dull down the fragrance. I know that after it leaves the seller that they are not responsible for what mother nature does. So I've learned a lesson today, never buy cologne over the internet during summer. Next time I'll wait for winter because colder temperatures are safe. You could even store your cologne in the fridge if you want. That's what I'm doing right now to try to see if I can salvage the scent. It's not totally ruined but I've purchased this many times before and found it to be way more powerful than it is right now."
3,Not Lacoste's best scent.,"Don't get me wrong, I think the smell of Lacoste for Men is nice, I just don't think it's anything more than that. I bought some a while back and instead of it being one of my 'signatures', I typically wear it in situations were I'd like to smell nice but not use one of my more expensive colognes. All in all, it's a decent smell but I can see why Lacoste decided to leave it behind. Give it a try, you might like it more than I do, I just can't help but think about how many other fish are in the sea when I smell this though."
3,I'm wondering if this is fake...,This just doesn't have the same strength as the same cologne that I bought in a retail store. I'm wondering if it is a fake.
1,"Product was sent in a timely manner, but.................",This cologne does not smell like the 20 other bottles of this cologne I have owned in the past? I don't know if it is old or got heated some way prior to delivery. I am disappointed in the scent.
3,Disappointing To Me,I'm just one person but this isn't what I expected. It's good and I've listened to it several times but it isn't what I anticipated it would be.The advertising I'd heard on the radio led me to order this product. I'm learning to be more cautious. I assumed that what was said on the radio would be true when the product arrived.I'd not buy again.
5,My Kingdom for a Radio!,"This is one of the best, if not THE best, book I have read on WWII and I have read my fair share. I have a special affinity for this book as it describes the efforts of my two ""favorite"" infantry divisions: the US 45th and 70th. My g'father was in the 70th but was in their artillery and thus not present at the Battle of Wingen-sur-Moder, which - as it turns out - had some effect on the battle. The author expertly describes his own role in the battle while using official American after-action reports and memoirs to flesh out the opposite side's activity. See Wallace Cheve's account for an American perspective. Zoepf's end-of-chapter analyses of communication (thus the title of this review), command/control, etc. are wonderful. His accounts of the civilian experience are short but sensitive. I liked best that he did not overwhelm with the ""big picture"" except as necessary. Highly recommended."
5,Seven Days in January: With the 6th SS-Mountain Division in Operation NORDWIND,"The most detailed account of Operation NORDWIND ever published, from both a German and US military perspective. Focused on the author's first hand account of the fighting at Wingen, but includes other critical actions in the Vosges mountains that influenced this battle. A must read for all seeking a clear picture of combat during the last major German offensive of WWII in western Europe."
4,Very detailed account of te battle from a senior officers perspective,"This was an interesting book, but it is not much of a first hand account. The author obviously went through a lot, but he was at a very high command level and his participation in the battles were very limited and in all honesty not very entertaining. If you want an exciting book to read about Nord and what it was like to be a soldier, I highly recommend ""Black Edelweiss."" This book is a very detailed account that often goes over the logistics of the battle and the planning on both sides. A great resource for somebody doing research for something larger concerning the western front late in the war, but not a page turning thriller likely to keep you up all night."
4,Does the Job,"Patched a hole bigger than a golf ball and worked fine, has a matte finish when completely dry. Home Depot sells for half the price."
5,Very good stuff for the price,Dries very quickly and is white when it dries. Goes on pink so you know when it dries. Good stuff for filling in holes and good price for the amount you get.
4,It was all right.,It was a little rougher than I thought it would be but still in good shape. It is a GREAT read!!
1,Very Poor Product,This is a very poor product. It is not worth the money i spent. The lights do not work. The umaterials are very poorly attached.
5,Another Winner by Pyzdek,"As usual, Mr. Pyzdek takes a complex and confusing subject and makes it easy to understand with concise prose and clear examples. As he has done in his other books (Pyzdek's Guide to SPC) he writes to the people who really need to understand the material: Quality Engineers and Managers. You will find this book a rewarding experince and a valuable addition to your bookshelf."
2,A good second source for process improvement tools,"Mr. Pyzdek treats the subject of organizational leadership, team make-up and team management extensively. He provides good suggestions for the groundwork of Management's role in Six Sigma. I found the section on training and education a good reminder chapter for infrequent trainers. The Principles section merely glossed over the essentials of Six Sigma philosophy. I found the Mikel Harry book much more helpful in this arena. And finally, I think the three chapters on Six Sigma Methods were arranged in a manner that makes it difficult for someone to know when to apply such tools. It does make a good second source to Breyfogle's excellent book on the Six Sigma tools."
5,REEL MAGIC,"""Access is something you create in the same way you create credibility. You do the job right."" The Producers Handbook presents deal structure and organizational practice for independent producers which do not require relationships with stars, super-agents and heads of studios, but rather rely on accepted, salient business practices -- which in turn not only engender such relationships, but successful, profitable, mainstream film making -- with distributors, agents, stars and investors who are pleased to be involved, and remain involved time after time. This material offers the most exciting, dynamic and pivotal business information and applications readers are likely to encounter in their entertainment career. Perhaps as life-changing as the day one sees their first motion picture or first determines to make motion pictures their life's work."
5,Highly recommended!,"I recently took the producer's business seminar offered by John J. Lee Jr. Not only is he an exceptional speaker, but the material within the book is truly amazing. For new producers like myself, the book gives the reader a wealth of information on the film business. For those of you who are interested in the seminar, I would also recommend that. Its worth every penny!"
3,Droooooooolllll,"It's hard to believe I watched this movie twice before I passed it onto others. It's enteraining in a strange way, the over the top plot, characters and accents (maybe it's because I'm australian). I'd be surprised if you would see this one in anyones home collection, don't expect too much."
1,If you have nothing else to do,"This movie doesn't rank as a bad movie. The script and story are bad. The acting by Laura and Jill Marie is good, however, the supporting cast is terrible!!!!! If you have nothing else to do with your time...I mean even getting an oil change, then see this movie."
1,Jerry Spinger meets the color purple,"This film seems to be a blend between the ""pushing daisies"" TV series & the ""color purple""... It was slickly covered toilet paper..,And I liked ""Pushing Daisies""... You got your wimpy weak abusive husband, A promiscuious daughter, a gay son, a doormat lesbian wife turned terminator and the single lesbian neighbor with no social responsibilities... The viewing of this Dvd became tedious with each scene, the ending brought relief... The disappointment with this Dvd was the pricing..."
3,YEARS OF THE BEAST,"This is an older Christian movie, perhaps a bit dated, but still does a good job of portraying plausible scenarios and the persecution of Christians (to a milder degree) as Biblical events unfold after the Rapture. Still a good witnessing tool for Christians in my opinion."
5,good thought provoking movie,nteresting movie. If anything it keeps the preparedness embers going. This movie would be good to watch in a small bible study group and talk about it.
5,Loved this album.,"I think this work kept me company day in and day out for weeks and I never tired of it. The emotional power of beautiful vocal work, backed up with innovative and groundbreaking (at the time) modern orchestration and rhythm. I've been looking for other things just like it ever since. *sigh*"
5,THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER,"at first all i watched was the show and thought it couldn't get better, then i saw the movie. the antic hawkeye, duke,and trapper john play are hilarious. but it is also touching through trapper and hawkeyes friendship"
2,"Dated, looks poor today","This movie aged faster than a fruit fly. Poorly filmed (it looks grainy in parts), strained humor, Altman's usual messy direction (or is it his non-direction?), all conspire to create a film that was topical for about a month and then corny, and then over-the-hill. The tv series is funnier."
1,yek,"Didn't like it after watching the series, I bought it for a friend. And I viewed it and just didn't like it."
5,Mash,"This was great, It was good to find something that I watched years ago that still interested me and was available in good condition"
4,Much about M.A.S.H.,"Funny, and very entertaining...Knew it was o ld hat from the start, but worth washing every so often. Watch again and laugh!"
3,M*A*S*H (Two -Disc Collector's Edition),It wasn't as funny as i expected it be like the television series. I guess i just to watch the tv reruns.
5,Great movie,Great movie with one of the best football scenes EVER. Do not expect the TV show...the movie is much better.
4,Altman's greatest commercial success...,"In the Seventies, while the Hollywood mainstream foundered, the finest American films were made by Robert Altman... A natural outsider, he intuitively opposed the heroic traditions of Hollywood's seamless narratives to create a fresh, personal style and a consistently provocative critique of The American Dream...Only with ""MASH,"" however, did his unique style first make itself felt... This seemingly chaotic black comedy, about a mobile army medical unit's anarchic adventures during the Korean War, made inventive use of a large cast, barely comprehensible multi-track dialog and a spontaneity of performance verging on the improvisational... But for all its gleeful mockery of conventional war heroics, the film (clearly intended to evoke the Vietnam War) was flawed by cynical cliché; sadly, but perhaps not surprisingly, it remains Altman's greatest commercial success..."
2,I DON'T CARE...,...how much extra stuff you put into this film! It'll still be AWFUL! Watch the series! It's a hundred times better than this mess of a film! Stupid and Dull! Only a few funny moments! Grade: D-
1,Christians be warned! This movie mocks God.,"I always enjoyed the weekly television series MASH, so I was quite shocked to discover that the movie version of MASH is a piece of garbage, which is where my copy ended up. My first shock was to discover that the catchy little tune they play at the beginning of every show is actually a song about suicide being painless. Next, one of the characters is mocked for praying. The worst scene is where they mock the Last Supper during a fake suicide. Enough said!"
5,One of funniest flicks ever!,"Great film, definitely an American classic. I saw the TV show maybe once or twice, and it never really impressed me. The film, on the other hand, is wickedly funny and has the kind of spirit that will keep you smiling throughout. Some of the bits are hilarious, even worth rewinding while you watch."
5,Anti-War Black Comedy Remastered,Altman's funny black comedy set during Korean War is a metaphor for Vietnam war.Innovative style of filmmaking especially with use of sound. DVD version has restored the film's original R-rating and claims to be ucut yet I don't understand what was put back in. Can someone please help me out here?DVD version includes a lot of bonuses. there are at least 3 documentaries including one about real MASH surgeons.
1,Poor Quality,"I Am A BIG fan of MASH, but I was very unhappy with the Quality of MASH the first season on VHS. DO NOT BUY IT. The DVD version is more than worth it , and I stongly recommend it."
1,offensive,"This movie glorifies sexual harrassment, homophobia, and adultery. ""Trapper"" and ""Hawkeye"" are the film's heroes, who are constantly sexually berating nurses. In one scene, ""Hot Lips"" is exposed while take a shower to the entire camp. She helplessly crawls away naked, screaming, while the entire camp laughs and jeers at her. How can that be funny? This scene was boderline rape.This movie was created by 60's counter-culture Hollywood to expose the horrors of the Vietnam war. That was accomplished, but the movies' creators exposed themselves as selfish, immoral, and hatefully disrespectful of women."
4,It was A*M*A*Z*I*N*G*,"This was one of the most brilliant, insightful, funny, poignant, compelling and sad movies I have ever seen. Every scene, which was a fragment, was much like Vietnam itself, fragmented, something to get through one day at a time, hopefully. One then hopes they have no recollection of the day before. (I am aware that the movie takes place in Korea, but it is a social commentary on Vietnam). Another thing that strikes me is how sensitive and touched the characters are; even though they try not to feel [or convey a sense of emotionlessness] and comedy is the release for all the emotions pent up during the day. There is no other way to describe it but as a satire of survival, (emotional, mental, physical). The only thing that may have made it better would have been to include another fragment on the end. You must rent it and savor it."
3,War Never Seemed So Funny,"Even now, thirty years after it's release, I can still get a few good laughs out of this movie. There are nonstop teenage pranks pulled off by Hawkeye, Trapper, and Duke and they seem to be masterfull surgeons. How it is that nobody can by the series and not this is beyond me.I recommend this title along with ""Animal House"" and the entire ""MASH"" series."
5,Scream for the Release,Not only is the movie a classic; the series needs to be released as well. One of the longest running series before being sent to re-run land. Hilarious while keeping what horrors war offers. Scripts are good and the acting even better.
5,B.E.S.T!!!,"I agree with the viewer from San Diego reviewing this masterpiece on March 13 who said this fim candidly had no concrete plot, but it was by all means not boring!!! What is so bad about a film not making a whole lot of sense? It was uproariously funny and inspired many, including myself, to use some of its catch phrases routinely. I first saw this motion picture on opening night in 1970 with my wife and have yet to forget its wild antics and plot. I own a copy of the cassette and want to tell you all out there to go out and buy it"
2,Not for the faint of heart...,"If you're use to the TV series you'll need to reset your mind to enjoy the movie. Much darker and more difficult to get into, the basics for the series are there but very well hidden. Watch it without expectations and you could be impressed. After years of the series I found it difficult to follow, but found it added some history to the characters that I had missed."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An uneven sketch comedy, M*A*S*H* is often reputed to reveal the absurdity of war when in fact the film is mainly content to offer Animal House style humor with war as a backdrop; overrated and dated, it should not rank high on a ""must-see"" or ""must-own"" list."
3,Second Release on DVD?,"Normaly I would give this movie a 5 stars. I mean it is that good. The movie is outstanding.Here is the reason I am giving this only 3 stars:I am puzzled of why 20th Century Fox is re-releasing this movie as a single disc DVD.They should have released the single disc first, then the Five Star Collection edition.Hey 20th Century Fox, why????????"
3,Disagree a little on Altman's commentary,He mentions at one point segregation of races in America and says it is still going on (in 2000 when he recorded his commentary). Huh? Ever since at least the early 90's segregation has been more than absolutely gone in the USA. On other areas of his commentary his views are usually fine. Like when he says that a real medical doctor was hired as technical consultant on the film.
2,not as good as the TV series (2.5/5),"though i thought this movie was OK,in my opinion it pales in comparisonto the Television series.i have nothing against any of theactors,most of whom were just staring out or barely known at thetime,and are now well known.but,in the TV series,the actor are a better fitfor the characters.the movie isn't as clever as the TV showeither,although there are some moments of dialogue brilliance.ElliotGould and Donald Sutherland do have good chemistry together though,andthat counts for something.however,something else that really bugged mewas the opening theme song.in the series,it's all instrumental.in themovie,we get to hear the lyrics which to me,overpower the piece,andtake away its impact.plus,the words don't really make sense and theydon't fit with the melody.that may seem like a minor point,but to meit's a major faux pas.as for the movie itself,it's not horrible by anymeans.it's just no masterpiece.for me MASH (the movie)is a 2.5/5"
2,Not so hot,"I bought this movie because my fiance is addicted to the TV show. However, even though it follows the same train of thought...doctors during the Korean conflict, who don't want to be there and drink and don't follow rules etc, it lacks the charm of the TV show by far. Donald Sutherland does nothing with the Hawkeye character but make him kind of creepy. However I don't understand why in the TV show they took out characters from the movie such as ""Duke""??? It is worth watching if you like the TV show because you get the contrast and you have a better understanding of how everything started for the show. But overall this movie was a disappointment for me. And it ruined the theme song (do you know it has words???)"
2,I hate when they do this.,"As stated before, this is a great DVD but it's already been done with the Five Star Collection MASH DVD. I don't see anything new here. DVD nuts like me really get tired of the studios constantly trying to get us to double dip for the same movie thinking we are going to get some new content. It's ridiculous. If you have Five Star Collection MASH DVD don't bother with this and even if you don't I wouldn't get this version. This package doesn't look as good as the previous release."
3,"Great movie, so so transfer","Could not wait for the blu-ray release of this classic film. Unfortunately the quality of the transfer was only average. Although the film originally had a somewhat grainy (intentional) look to it, that could not make up for the lack of definition and color saturation. It appears that the studio elected to do a 'down and dirty' quickie transfer rather than spend the money on a full restoration, which is a shame. If you own the original DVD I would save your money and wait (hopefully) for a proper blu-ray re-release sometime in the future."
5,Sparx is an excellent Latin group,"They make their songs come alive with their vibrant touch which has me listening to them over and over, again."
3,Description,"Fiona believed that love had deserted her for ever. There remained Torquil MacLean, whom she liked and respected, and the work they could do together in the glen that meant so much to them both. Could a successful marriage be built on that foundation?"
4,Defense of Hidden Variables,"Bohm in this book attacks to Standard Interpretation of Quantum Physics. He starts with definition of Physical Theories, Laws of Nature, discusses Statistical Mechanics and goes into Deterministic Mechanicstic Philosophys and indeterminist Mechanistic Philosophy. He attackes Bohr and Heisenberg on their stand that Uncertainity Principal is the rule of the nature and foundation of Quantum Physics.Claims it is not conclusively proven as a rule and than argues that one can always find new Theory that can be fundemantally different from Uncertainity Principle, yet could explain nature better and yields current Quantum Physics as complimentarity. Although he claims that Heisenberg's claim is with no foundation, I believe he fails to prove that Nature can not be explained completely with limited number of laws and concepts.His argument against Heisenberg could be reversed and used against his own argument"
3,A Little Bit Crappy Halloween,"""Snappy Little Halloween"" is a pop-up book featuring assorted Halloween characters (witches, ghosts, mummies etc).The illustrations are incredible. The children love to see the scary creatures spring out. Each page contains a short verse on a character.""Halloween's a time for spells. This witch makes strange things grow.But - oops! - she's made her nose too long - OH! OH! OH!""I wasn't happy with the verses. I felt that the author wasn't making a genuine effort to describe these characters. In particular, there is a suit of arms, yet young children (two's and three's) who may not have ever seen one, wouldn't know what the characters name was because it is not mentioned. The same can be said for Frankenstein."
1,Disappointed,I received this book and it was ripped and in bad shape. I contacted the seller who sent me another at no charge and insisted that I keep the torn one that I originally received. The second book was in worst shape then the first book. I just purchased a new online instead. The books were in bad shape but their customer service was 100%.
3,Not quite as sticky as I hoped,Using it to train doberman ears to stand (oy - lots of work!). Tape wasn't quite as sticky as I hoped and I have had to re-tape on occasion.
3,Missing Pictures,"This book is a good review in bullet-point format, but it's missing crucial pictures of conditions such as impetigo, erysipelas, and common rashes found in infections such as measles and mumps. There are verbal descriptions of the conditions, but being able to recognize these conditions in a picture is essential for the boards. I recommend Microbiology by Harvey to supplement or replace Microbiology and Immunology Rapid Review."
5,Such a wonderful source book,"If you need to find out about gay organizations, gay friendly insurance companies, gays in the military, support groups, gay writers, lesbian characters in novels or ANYTHING gay related (almost): get that wonderful book!"
3,1992 Version - A Bit Outdated,This 1992 version of the book is mainly in black and white and uses some older terms and procedures that are no longer used these days. It does cover the topics well and in good detail. I would try to purchase a newer copy.
1,Cheap......you get what you pay for.,I MIGHT buy it fir less than 10 bucks.Cheap material. Cheap construction.
1,Don't bother,"Just as the previous reviewer stated, these things ""snap like twigs"". Thank you, China, for flooding our home improvement stores with cheap products like this. That said, when the bits do snap off, st least you have the option of replacing just the drill bit with one made out of real metal. The actual countersink component is made in the USA.Perhaps a warning label advising the user not to use these in anything harder than balsa wood."
3,Bits are cheap,There is a huge difference between inexpensive and cheap. This set is cheap. It is cheaply made and the price reflects as much. I use this set in conjunction with a Makita set quite a bit. I was excited to put this set to good use around the house and in my workshop when I started snapping the drill bits like twigs. I went through two of them before I decided that I wasn't going to mess around with the cheap drill bits any more and began to use spare drill bits with one side ground down to fit in the Hitachi quick change system. I am disappointed at Hitachi for producing such a cheap set. I love my other Hitachi products...Maybe I received an atypical set.
2,De Shootinest Gent'man,"classic but so steeped in the racism and conventions of the early 20th century that I really had trouble enjoying the book. The maudlin sentimentality of the white and privileged writer thinking that there is something cheery about the light seeping between the logs of the the black tenents' cabins without any regard for the fact that that means that there is no protection from the weather, or his jocular descriptions of the constant verbal threats and abuse bestowed on bowing and scraping servants in a part of the country where lynchings were not uncommon just set my teeth on edge. The paternalistic warmth for the balck under class combined with the smug self satisfaction aof the author and his sincere affection of his underlings are instructive into the traditional poat Civil war attitude of the Southern gentleman, but it detracts form the hunting stories."
5,Great Book,"As a life long wing shooter with personal interest in history, these stories written by Mr. Buchingham offer a window into hunting lifestyles and opportunity that one can only dream about today. It also offers a reflection of the social aspects of the post Civil War south as seen thru the eyes of landed gentry."
2,Drip...drip...drip!!!,It's a leaker...I need to keep the spout over a small container or it drips all over everything.
1,Not the quality I expected,"I did not buy this from Amazon.com. It was bought at a local store. I used it for about 6 hours total over 6 days. It will no longer turn on using either setting. I've tried unplugging, waiting hours to try to use it again, everything I can think of and nothing will resurrect it. I love dremel's rotary tool, I own two of them for different purposes. Due to the quality and use I've had out of the rotary tool, I thought I was making a sound decision to purchase this glue gun. If you're thinking the same thing, DON'T be fooled."
2,Good features in a VERY wasteful glue gun,"I purchased this glue gun after it was featured on the Martha Stewart Show and I was impressed with the following features: on-off button didn't require unplugging, lighted tip, dual-temp, LED-ready light, pop-out stand, stands upright steadily, large trigger, sturdy feel of the gun, silicone tip to prevent burns, and 3 different tips. Unfortunately, after releasing the trigger, the glue continues to flow from the tip. Some drip is typical of most glue guns however, this gun really releases a lot of extra glue. (I've posted the red pictures above to illustrate this.) At first, I thought perhaps it was the glue stick or the temperature setting, but three different brands yielded the same ""super-drip"" at either heat setting. This unfortunately was a deal-breaker because it is a VERY WASTEFUL and extremely messy."
2,Will and tear drips constantly while it is in its harness,"I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but the glue gun constantly drips large puddles of glue while it sits in its harness. I may send it back."
3,Disappointed In Dremel,"I am disappointed in Dremel. The 1200 has a light, two temperature settings, is ergonomically designed to feel good in your hand and do a good job.The problem is that it takes way too long to heat up. When it does it drips glue all over the place. If this was an isolated incident it would be acceptible, but I bought two of these lemons for work. We hate to use them because of the dripping. I have to put a piece of cardboard under it to keep it from making a big mess.I previously had Arrow Fastener glue guns. No light, no dual temp setting, just a simple glue gun and stand with a drip catcher. It didnt drip that much however. Too bad they got old and needed to be replaced.I give it three stars because it heats up and glues. Whats with the light anyway? A lot of people glue in the dark and need a blue light?saxman"
2,PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!!,"I give this a 2 star rating because, the light at the tip is a great feature and the glue gun is comfortable in your hand. The main problem is that this glue gun uses more glue after you use it than when your using it. IT DRIPS GLUE LIKE NO OTHER. Glue sticks are expensive so spend your money on a surebonder or something else."
5,Awesome!,This book was exactly as described. I could not have asked for a better experience. Shipped fast and was here before I could even think about it.
5,Great Service! Great book!,"I read this book almost 40 years ago...and ordered it for a friend last month! It is easy to understand, and is wonderful at introducing you to the gifts of the Holy Spirit! It is a very practical and well-written book. Its contents are still current today! If you want a better understanding of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, this is the book for you!"
3,Great concept,The intent is great. The flaw of this product is the size. The product could and should be big. The fact that the volcano is smaller than a 7oz plastic cup is disappointing. The book that comes with the volcano is very user friendly. Its the volcano which is laughable.
5,Love it! Powerful and beautiful.,My hands aren't strong enough to knead bread and the bread machine wasn't working for me. This works well and makes the bread-making process so much easier!
5,Great mixer!,"Have used this mixer many times for a variety of things in less than a month. The dough hood is great for making breads, the texture turns out wonderful! The whisk makes whipped cream fast and easy. The regular beater is great for cookies. Highly recommended!"
5,Best Coutertop Mix I have ever seen or used,"I have been using mine for the past month. It is extremely durable and mixes items extremely well. I have mixed items from frosting, cake mixes, cookie dough and more and not once have I been disappointed on how well it is mixed. In fact I believe it has made the items I was making even better than doing it by hand or with a hand mixer. I will be getting the additional attachments soon. No way would I give this up. It has quickly became the must have item in my kitchen, without it is not an option."
3,Loud screeching motor,"I bought this mixer and when I got it the motor would scream on speed 6 also the beater hit the side of the bowl, also the bowl where the handle is riveted on was missing the finish so the bowl leaked outside the handle. I was very dissapointed so I called KitchenAid and the people there were very nice, They asked me a few questions and I told them about it and then they said they would send me a brand new one with no cost to me, well I got the new one and it was perfect, they asked me to send them the old one back and it was all postage paid and Fed Ex came to my door to pick it up, so even though the first one maybe was a fluke, this one exceeds my expectations, works great and I am very happy with it. Thanks Amazon, and Thanks KitchenAid !!"
5,Can't believe I waited this long!,"Terrific machine, performs great. All that I expected and I'm having a blast baking again! Just wish I had bought one years ago. Great price from Amazon and great service. Love it!!"
4,Excellent Value,"Received my KitchenAid Pro600 Stand Mixer in excellent shape, at a very nice Holiday Price. Very satisfied with shipping and service."
5,Kitchen Aid stand mixer,"This 6 qt. mixer us the best I've ever used, very powerful and mixes 4 loaves of bread with ease. cookies are a snap with this,will mix 3 or 4 batches at a time. So far, I'm very pleased with it.D. R. W."
5,excellent deal,"very good deal and the product was exactly as it was describe , received it on time and perfect packaging."
5,Super Mixer,I got this for my mom for Christmas........she loves it.....previously she has worn out many other mixers since she bake all the time. This one works great!
1,Missing almost everything!,"I ordered this because it was a bit bigger than the standard 4.5qt and 5qt. and I do a lot of baking, so I thought the bigger one would be better.I got it pretty fast, but when I opened the box everything was missing or damaged. I think this might have been a return that was then sold to me as new!There was no paddle, no dough hook, and no pour shield! All it had was the whip. Then on further inspection the tabs on both the bowl and the mixer were bent out of shape so the bowl would not attach at all. It was not even close to lining up.I contacted Amazon to return it and then tried to re-order the same color. Now the color I wanted is a lot more than it was a few days ago and no longer Prime, so I was forced to either order another color and pay more or order the smaller version. I decided on the smaller version (which still does not come in the color I wanted). Not very happy at all."
5,KichenAid 6-Quart Mixer,I debated if I wanted the 6-quart or the 5-quart mixer because there was some difference in price. I'm glad I went with the 6-quart because it can handle anything. Excellent machine and I use it on a regualr basis.
5,excellent mixer,i have always loved kitchenaid products. i bought this as a gift to my mother in-law and she can't get enough of it. she used it as soon as she unpacked it and hasn't stopped since.
5,great price for this great mixer,"Had the this large mixer previously as a refurbished model which lasted for years. But when it did die and I needed to replace it, this was the best price I could find, which is fantastic for this size model. Kitchen Aid makes the best mixers...would not get any other kind."
2,Very loud when using attachments,"This post is related to using attachments for this Kitchen Aid.ATTACHMENT USED: KitchenAid Pasta Press AttachmentI am shocked at the high pitch sound that is made when using the attachments.The attachments allows you to press fresh spaghetti, bucatini, rigatoni, fusilli, and small or large macaroni - after drying you cook it. The pasta tastes good but the machine makes a super loud high extremely high pitch sound while doing it - my advise, wear ear protection."
1,beware!,"I have had the >$300.00 professional mixer for about 3 years. It quit lifting the bowel, some kind of jamb, with only light occasional use. I e-mailed the company and they offered to ship it to their service center for the price of $35.00, with no guarantee of any fixes available. They will gladly, however, offer in the same e-mail, a RECONDITIONED mixer at a reduced price. WHAT ARE THEY THINKING! They are showing a conflict of interest in their own words! They can't loose- they either get me by charging a lot to fix mine, or send mine, if THEY DECIDE it is a total loss, to their refurbish area, fix it, and make money that way. Then, if I'm really gullible, I'll buy another at a reduced, refurbished price! They kill their own reputation! NEVER AGAIN!!!"
5,Kitchen aid stand mixer,"This is an excellent product for the price, it was a great black friday deal and everything I wanted it to be,"
1,Smoke comming out after only 3 minutes of use,I just received my new KP26M1PSL with serial # starting with W14. I am not sure but the mixer looks used. The attachments are blemished like someone washed them in a dishwasher or they were stored in a damp place for a long time. Could be the second one since I read serial numbers starting with W14 are the older discontinued model. Yes you are not supposed to wash the parts in a dishwasher.I unpacked the mixer and decided to give it a try. Started mixing my favorite pizza dough first on speed 1. 2-3 minutes later I switched to speed 2 (per the booklet) and after only 1 minute heavy smoke started coming out the back of the machine. I called customer service and talked to Justice. She was helpful and placed a replacement order. Unfortunately they are on back order and it will take 2-4 weeks before I get the replacement. Hopefully it will be an unit with serial above W15. I will report after I receive it.
1,Terrible Product!,"I have owned 7 of these mixers in 7 years, trying to make bread. Each year, the mixer fails within several months and is cheerfully replaced by Kitchenaid. As other reviewers have stated, the gearing is simply faulty and any slight strain will quickly (within months) destroy the gearing. If you do not make bread, this product might work well for years, but then you should buy a cheaper less powerful model than this. If you make bread, this product will fail! After 7 replacements, Kitchenaid refused any more returns. THIS IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT and Kitchenaid is well aware of this and still refuses to fix the gearing. STAY AWAY FROM THIS MIXER!"
4,Worth it!!,"In 20 years I have worn out two Kitchen Aid Classics...even the enamel on the beaters! Amazon's price made the jump to the Professional a no-brainer. I am very pleased with it's abilities, accessories and appearance. The only reason I scored four out of five was due to the sound of the mixer. It is really different in an unpleasant way."
1,They Don't Build 'Em Like They Used To,"My first KA was the 5 qt stand mixer. I used it 20 yrs - and gave it away. I replaced it with the KP26 mixer, their biggest and best. The accessories don't work (cut) like the old atch did, the machine is a monstrosity that takes too much counter space, and everything I've prepped on it so far - something has gone wrong. I got an unbelievable price via Amazon promotion, but it's just too big for my kitchen. My first use involved the veggie shredder and it felt like the shaft of the shredder was bending as I applied pressure to the potato. This gave an impression I was forcing improperly, but fact is- on first use this shredder would barely cut a potato; my first shredder (yrs ago) went through potatoes like a hot knife through soft butter.Make sure you need a model this large before you buy it."
1,very poor customer service,"my mixer died within a year under very mild usage. customer service was very rude. she accused me either not using the machine correctly or my recipes are wrong. Also, she said the mixer should not be on for more than two minutes when it is on high speed. I was using speed TWO!!! And what kind of $300 mixer should be expected not to run for more than two minute?! If they want to charge $300 for a mixer, I expect that they should do a better quality control, products and customer services wise."
1,Couldn't handle bread dough,"Returned the mixer as it couldn't handle six cups of flour for a bread recipe. The motor seized up after a few minutes. Before that, the bowl jumped off & on the holding knobs."
2,Third Kitchen Aid mixer,"This is the third Kitchen Aid mixer I have bought and it has lasted the longest. The first two lasted just over a year each, this one( the Professional 600 Series 6 quart Stand Mixer) has lasted from December of 2006 to today february 28, 2009. The gears have gone on this one, just like the first one and the second one the plastic housing broke. This one also has a plastic housing but a little more substantial.They work great when they work but they don't last that long. I just bought another one for our Daughter for Christmas(the professional 600 series) thinking that Kitchen-aid finally got it right. We will see how long it lasts."
2,Did not last,I bought this model KT2651XWW Epicurean 6 qt machine for myself as I have been drooling over getting one for years. I used it 3 times for christmas and then pulled it out this year to find it does not work. It does not even turn on.I am really disappointed; it does have metal housing and feels like a workhorse but wants to be out to pasture way before it's time. I am in process now of attempting to get it repaired or a motor to fix it myself.
1,Overpriced even at a discount,"Just look at what comes with it to start with, none of the beaters are dishwasher safe.And most of the accessories are not either.Can not even handle a five cup dough recipe without burning up,one of the most disappointing purchases I have made.And a lot of good a return policy is when it will cost forty dollars to ship it for service."
3,To big for the average kitchen,Have not been able to use it. It's so big it will not fit in or under any of my existing cabinets.
1,Shame On Kitchen Aid and Amazon,I received this item in only the packing you would see on the store shelf. It has black grease all over it. There is yellow goop and black grease where your hands can contact it when raising and lowering the bowl. The whisk beater clangs against the bowl with every revolution of the motor.I am highly dissappointed and expect a new one to be sent immediately.
1,Macy's Architect series...,"We used at home 3 times the third one we realized that the ""steinless steel"" bowl was rusting. This series pretend to be the most trendy (...and expensive).Brought back to Macy's and bye bye, no regrets.My next one will be a EU's 'Bosh' if I can find one at 110 V. otherwise better nothing then a $ 450.00 appliance that rust almost immediately on hand-washing!!!"
3,Problems,"Estimados señores:En noviembre del año pasado compré una batidora Kitchen Aid, como lo pueden ver al final de este correo. Desde que la recibí la velocidad 6 nofuncionaba pero con las otras velocidades podía trabajar. Sin embargo un mes después la velocidad 10 dejó de funcionar. Utilizo la batidora pocasveces pero la última velocidad es la que se utiliza para hacer claras de huevo a punto de nieve y no he podido hacerlo.Les solicito me indiquen qué debo hacer para aplicar la garantía en Costa Rica porque enviar la batidora de regreso a Estados Unidos me resulta muy caro.No había enviado este correo antes porque no domino el inglés y debía buscar quién podía traducirlo.Les solicito que por favor me indiquen lo que debo hacer.Gracias"
3,Exceptional price and product- idiotic packaging,"The price the product, everything was perfect.....except.....the item was delivered and left on my doorstep without any external packaging. So anyone driving by could see what it was! Thankfully it was not stolen and thankfully the person I purchased this gift for did not come home in time to see it. Please consider some sort of external wrapping next time!!!"
1,it didnt work out of the box,I just got home and found my new kitchen aid mixer waiting for me. I took it out of the box and plugged it in and it ran for 5 seconds and cut off. It does this each time I try to use it. I contacted customer service and was told the unit was old and out of warranty. It is not supposed to be a refurbished mixer.( I just ordered it from amazon)I must fax them a copy of the shipping invoice before they send me a new machine. My initial impression is bad product not worth the high cost but good customer service. The mixer was much louder than expected and the fit and finish of the mixer and accessories doesn't match what I have seen in stores. I'll repost when I get my new mixer.UPDATEHere it is 3 years later and the mixer is working great. Don't know how I lived without it. However unless you need to make 2 to 4 loaves of bread at a time I would get the smaller one.
1,not satisfied,I had a Kitchenaid mixer for 25 years and loved it. What happened to this company. Wish I had paid attention to the negative reviews on the 6 quart mixer. Will never buy another Kitchenaid. This mixer is horrible. Followed directions carefully. Did not mix bread above 2. Cannot even mix one batch of bread or cookies without problems. Please be advised this mixer has serious problems. I would give it no stars.
2,A bit disappointing,"I was so excited when buying this on a super deal, but I now know why it was a super deal. For some reason the the rubber handle that should have been on the lever to put the bowl up and down, is missing, not like the ones you buy at the store. If you have an attachment on and you want to remove the bowl, it can become very messy, not enough room to get bowl off if it has stuff in it. Also, much LOUDER than other Kitchenaid mixers of this same type, I am assuming that is why it was on a special deal, becuase it is very LOUD.A bit disappointed, not sure I will buy a special deal again, with the experience I have had. I had waited 5 years to buy one, and now realized should spent more money to buy in the store."
4,I love it,"This is just a little bigger than I thought it was, didn't quite fit under my kitchen cabinets. However, it is an amazing tool! I can make cookies, cakes, breads, you name it - all without a shoulder ache!I would recommend it to anyone."
3,This 600 is Ok,"I have this mixer for more than six month. It is Ok to me. It will have some smell if you run it more than 30 min. I was making noodles, then I found it smelled like something burned. So, I stopped, waiting it cooled down. However, it was a good machine but had weak power. I will suggest someone want to buy it...they have new model comming out...the 700 series. I think it would be better than this model since it has 1.5 horse power."
1,My sincere advice: do not buy this,"I bought one pro 600 in 2010 before Mother's day. The problem occured in Oct 2011. It last about one and half year. The problem is the gears. The gears wears out EASILY (Convicing evident: I opened up the unit and saw the wear and tear myself. In addition, I searched it on youtube that others had exact same problem) My wife used this machine twice a week for kneading dough. I regretted that I bought 2 more units as a gift to my family."
2,Does not live up to the name,I have had my kitchenaid for less than 3 years and have probably used it 15 times total I am in the middle of making bread and it started making a weird noise and sounds like the motor is gone. I am very disgusted to think we paid $300 for a mixer that you are going to get less than 3 years use for that amount of money I will do some research before buying a new one.
2,Not worth the money,"I had an Artisan mixer for over 10 years until the motor recently burned out..I decided to upgrade to the professional mixer..I had the mixer exactly 2 days and a piece broke because it was cheaply made..I then tried to make bread, which is why I bought it, and the motor got so hot after a few minutes, i turned it off in fear it would blow..I decided after that to send it back as it was not worth the money..I will be buying the Artisan again in the near future.."
1,junk after 2.25 years,"I bought one of these in Dec 2008. It quit working after about 9months. Great return policy. However, a year and a half into using the replacement, the same problem occurred. While mixing 1 large loaf of white flour bread, the gears started to grind and the machine stopped. Everything I've read about these newer KAs is that they cannot handle bread dough. so even though I got the one that is supposed to work for ""14 cups of flour"", a ""double batch of bread dough"", and has ""commericail style performance"", it is junk for the main activity I need it for. don't buy it if that is how you want to use it. I've given up on KA and will be trying something different."
3,Great machine but it broke after a year,"I love my mixer and have used it frequently. The whole plate that holds the attachments fell off, however, in the middle of kneading dough. Customer service was very unhelpful; they gave us the wrong number for a repair dealer. Customer service actually recommended that we simply purchase a new machine! I assumed there must be a screw or some such that needed to be replaced, but it cost more than $200 . Moreover, the repairman indicated that this was a very frequent occurence. I love the performance of the machine, and since I now have another $200 invested in it, I will continue to use it. But if and when it breaks again, I plan to replace it with another brand."
4,KitchenAid Review,"I have used the mixer several times making artisan bread as well as cookies. My only complaint is that the mixer does not completely mix the ingredients in the bottom of the bowl. I read a suggestion that someone put a spring above the whip and that helped the problem. I would like to know more about how this was done and exactly where the spring was placed and how big the spring is supposed to be. I would recommend this product. Besides,it is red and looks gorgeous on my counter!"
1,kitchenAid YOU DO NEED AID,"Well,I purchased this PROFESSIONAL 600 6 qt stand mixer. Well, it looks great make a lot of noise.If you prepare eggs, soft batter,custards etc it would do the job.However,if you do bread dough,pizza dough SAVE YOUR MONEY I have had the old kitchenaid about 30 years made by HOBART. It is still going after making bread dougs 3 times a week, grinding w/att. Moz cheese 10lbs at a time---NEVER A PROBLEM.Now with the new 6qt stand mixer it lasted 6 months.Sad to say service was a issue -the cost of sending it to be repared? then will it last???? So I bit the bullet and dumped it!!So I purchased a 7 gt commercial stand mixer-- My wife used it for christmas and can""t believe she can double her recipe.I can only say if your going to use it for breads SAVE YOUR MONEY-I now know why KITCHENAID put AID into its product-YOU NEED A LOT OF AID!!!"
5,Christmas Gift,This was the first gift with a cord I have given to my wife in 10 years. Her smiles said it all.I hit a grand slam.
1,Never started,"I just purchase this mixer and it won't start. This is my third KA mixer, and may be my last. I guess its going back. Will contact Amazon about return."
1,Does not work for bread dough,"This 600 series does not deserve the description ""Professional"". The technical difficulties are well described by the other comments. It is a disappointing product. After the warranty period the mixer broke down. During the kneading of bread dough the mixing part ""popped"" and whilst the engine was still working, part of the mixer fell off into the dough. Customer service was unhelpful and told us to expect to wait 4 to 8 weeks and pay CAD 120 for the replacement part. We used the mixer on an average two times a week and well within the indicated limits."
5,"Great Product, bit deceiving on Amazon's part","Ordered after much research and Amazon had a good price. When looking at images of product, second picture is for a mother's day offer for ice cream maker or pasta maker. I ordered mixer but when I wanted to print out offer, I see it's from a 2005 offer. Amazon might just missed it for the last 6 years but I have my doubts. Ended up, Kitchenaid had another offer for icecream maker but not pasta maker I wanted. Good price either way but I thought I was also getting the pasta maker."
1,One less lifetime customer,"A poorly designed head on this series resulted in the mixer literally falling apart in to the food I was making. I swore by Kitchen Aid back when I worked in restaurants. I convinced my wife to go along with me on purchasing the Pro. Now my loyalty makes me look like an idiot. We called Kitchenaid, but they failed to stand by the mixer - and they lost a strong advocate for their brand."
5,Big improvement,"I received this mixer as an early Christmas gift when my old 6 quart mixer quit just before Thanksgiving. The old mixer was one of the early 6 quart KitchenAid mixers with a 525 watt motor. The 525 motor seemed to have problems and is no longer made for the 6 quart machine. I got two replacement machines under warranty before I was shipped one which lasted a few years. When my 525 machine quit, I decided to replace it rather than fix it.The first thing I noticed about the new, 6 quart, 575 watt machine was that it is MUCH quieter than my old one. Thus far, I have used it over a dozen times for bread and double batches of cookies. It handles it all with ease."
2,NOT FOR BREAD,"I have had this mixer for 3 years and had to have it replaced once, because the motor was making a funny noise. It has now started slipping gears; it cannot handle kneading a simple single white bread recipe. It gets hot and the gears slip. It is great for cake, icing, etc. If you have heavier work to do-go with another brand."
2,not long lasting! $300 in repairs later ...,"We bought this mixer 6 years ago, but only used it about once a month until about a year ago. I started making my own bread about 1x a week. It is a wheat bread 3c white / 3c wheat flour. After a few months, the engine burnt out. I've had to change to 4c white & 2 c wheat because the mixer couldn't handle it. Since then, I've had to take it in two more times & have boon told by the repair tech. to either get a new mixer (he doesn't ever recommend this mixer!) the 5qt one, or quit making bread. So disappointed!! I've spent over $300 in repairs on a ""professional"" mixer that can not even be used on a weekly basis."
3,Mixer - good and bad,"I like the size of the bowl on this mixer, but it is WAY more noisy than my older smaller Kitchen Aid mixer. Also, I find it doesn't mix small quantities very well. For cookies, once I get the dry ingredients into the wet, it mixes well. In the smaller mixer (4 quart?) I could do a batch of bread without a problem. You would think a larger mixer like the 600 series would mix a double batch of bread, but it often overheats when I try."
3,like it but....,Received this as a gift and use it for making pasta and bread predominantly. The first one had to be shipped back due to alignment problems with the pasta attachments. The shipping was paid for and the service department was excellent to work with. This one works well except that the bowl keeps bouncing out of the stand when mixing. This is very frustrating as you have to hold it in when mixing.Not certain I would recommend it and certainly glad I didn't pay full price for it.
2,Hold the bowl!,We have never owned a stand mixer so we were excited to use it (Kitchenaid KP26M1PGC Professional 600 Series) for the first time. Our excitement was short lived because the bowl on the mixer pops off when using the dough hook. My daughter had it come off when making a small batch of holiday treats and I had it come off when making pizza dough that only had three cups of flour in it. The motor also sounded loud and appeared to struggle when working the pizza dough.We will either send the mixer back or modify it so that the bowl stays it place.
5,"Super Mixer, Super Price, Super Fast!","Amazon really came through! I had been watching deals for KitchenAids for a while and wanted to purchase it during their rebate period before 12/31. This mixer is one of their largest(6qt) and most powerful(575watt), which is important if you want to make bread or pizza dough or larger quantities of anything. And, the price offered after Thanksgiving was unheard of! My mom was so impressed that she bought one too after owning her 4.5qt for 15 years. This mixer is great for almost anything you want to bake. I bought it as a family gift, and my kids (ages 10, 8, and 6) LOVE it! It's a great way to learn about cooking and have some terrific quality time! We've already made Christmas cookies, pizza dough, and pumpkin rolls. It kneads like nobody's business and my hands aren't even tired! If you're even considering it, just keep watching amazon.com for a good deal, and it will come up! Bon appetit!"
4,Superior Mixer,This mixer is amazing. It is very powerful and very easy to use. It can handle a large amount of thick dough and mix it throughly.
5,Love it!,This machine is everything I wanted and more. It handles heavy bread dough with ease and everything goes so much faster than the old mixer I was using. It is very heavy and does not scoot across the counter when running.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who cooks and bakes regularly.
5,Awesome KitchenAid pro600,I got my KitchenAid pro600 at the beginning of December. I have used it quite a bit with the holiday meal and baking. I made 4 batches of cookies at the same time. What a time saver. I absolutely love it. My mash potatoes are like whipped butter. Yum. Best purchase ever.
5,Love this stand mixer,The KitchenAid stand mixer is the gold standard for stand mixers and I was not disappointed. Keep in mind that this is a tall mixer - If you plan to leave it on the counter it will not fit under your hung cabinets.
4,Powerful enough to puree a brick,I have used this model to make Christmas cookies for friends and family for the last 4 years. 26 medium to full sized tins so taking a recipe and quadrupling it was standard. The bowl is huge and will hold such excess (which is nice) and the motor is strong enough to power through anything you throw at it. Before this we used to go through one to two hand mixers each year. It's *very* expensive which is why I am only giving it 4 stars but it is the best. Also... we had a problem with the original one (burning smell) and the customer service folks were excellent. They immediately shipped us a new one and told us to put the old one in the replacement box. They included paid postage for the return and sent the replacement 2 day air. Nice!
5,stand mixer,"This was a gift x my wife, but i benefit from the great things she prepares with it, the time she saves in it, and the cleanliness of the whole process.I am buying all the accesories, the cover and something to help in making sausages.She intends to make bread, cubcakes, pasta, and a big etc.."
5,Great Mixer,"Loved everything about this product, quality and color, easy to use, would recommend to friends, gave this as a gift and intend on buying one for me"
5,good mixer,This is the best mixer money can buy. Anything else your just wasting your money. Amazon's price can't be beat by anyone.
4,A Must Have,"I love my KitchenAid 6-Quart mixer. I purchased a 600 series mixer to get the greater ""horsepower"" of the motor. (This motor can handle my stiff-dough recipes easily.) I didn't give it a 5-star for three reasons. First, the whip and mixing attachments don't quite reach low enough in the bowl, so I have to do more scraping by hand than I would like to. Next, because the top does not open up and back like some of the lower models do, I can't reach into the bowl very well unless I take the mixing attachment off to do my scraping. Lastly, I don't like the way it sounds and performs at the lowest speed setting. It sounds like it's laboring away. I love the Nickel Pearl color. It's a ""must have"" addition to my newly remodeled kitchen."
4,excellent kitchen helper,"It is my dream to have this in my kitchen. It makes every work in baking so easy. I hope I can have more attachments to help me do more works. I know it is expensive, but if you have big family to feed and love the kitchen magic, you better have this to be your helper. It makes your life much easier and fun."
5,Great Product Best Price,This is by far the best mixer of its type on the market. Amazon's price for this in the Licorice color was the best I have ever seen.
1,"broken gearbox, no support","The gearbox broke after ~15 uses in ~2 years. Since it was out of waranty, Kitchenaid made no efforts to ""make it right"" in any way. I realize they can't support products for ever, but in this case, I consider it a faulty product."
2,Nope,"This is a great mixer if you enjoy baking cakes and cookies. However, I cannot recommend it for bread baking as it is not good at handling large quantities of dough, nor can the motor handle a stiff dough - the motor will burn out, smoke, or shed grease - and simply will not last. Get the Magic Mill or better yet, the Bosch with the metal bowl, if you are serious about baking bread."
1,Machine stopped working in few min,"Is there anyone who used the 600 * 6 qtr mixer to make a 14 cup flour + liquid bread dough?Mine newly purchased stopped after few minutes.Called kitchen aid, was told it should be 14 cups in total, that is flour + liquid + others = 14 cups. But, the instruction says 14 cups of flour.If I am the only unlucky one, I will have to make an exchange."
5,Kitchenaide 600 series,"WOW! This machine is a dream! Powerful, sturdy, good for stiff doughs. Easy to clean and use. I lend it out often to less fortunate foodies."
4,"Not as convenient as the smaller one, but great deal at a good price","I like this mixer for it's capacity - it easily holds 3 cake mixes. The motor is a little loud, much more that my smaller (tilt head) kitchenaid. My 2 complaints are you can't get the bowl off without removing the paddle & that gets a bit messy - we are a bakery & actually use this repeatedly. And, #2 the paddle is definiely cheap. It seems to mix good though & I bought it for about $250 with a $40 rebate (yet to be seen). So, for around $200, I don't think you can go wrong. I would never buy this for over $250 though - I would rather have a tilt head one."
3,"Loud, shrill noise","Pro 600 KitchenAid stand mixerI wanted a powerful mixer, and I got it. I leave the beautiful black mixer out on the counter as if it were decoration.What I did not bargain for was the unbelievably loud noise it makes. When I turn it on, it emits a shrill sound which is alarming at first. If anyone, child or adult, had been sleeping when I first turned it on, they would have been startled awake. Now, I hesitate to use the machine.There is a minor design flaw that probably cannot be helped. Flour lodges where the bowl attaches to the stand. And yes, I used the shield. Working diligently with toothpicks, I was able to remove the flour.The paddle comes with sharp burrs which need to be removed before use.My old KitchenAid mixer had problems that were never resolved, so I chose to buy a professional mixer. I find it hard to believe that professionals would listen to the noise all day."
1,"Good news, Bad news","The bad news is that the mixer (6 qt. Pro) sounded bad right out of the box. It got to the point where the motor was scary after one month of use. The good news is that after calling and letting the customer service actually listen to it, they replaced it immediately, even though the service rep seemed to indicate that we had done something wrong. The new mixer is not exactly quiet either, but haven't used it yet, just turned it on to see how it sounded. We had a 4 1/2 qt mixer for years and the motor sounded like a mixer usually does."
5,Fabulous KitchenAid Stand Mixer!,We purchased this mixer for our daughter as a Christmas gift and were so pleased to see the great deal. She was delighted and obviously surprised with her gift when she opened it tonight. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a high end stand mixer. We anticipate many wonderful and delicious treats prepared by this mixer. It was a gift for her but the family will definitely reap the rewards.
5,Kitchenaid 6 qt Mixer,Very nice very high quality mixer. Daughter can't wait to get all the attachments.
3,wish it wasn't as tall,"I like this machine a lot but wish it wasn't as tall so that it would fit on counter between upper and lower cabinets when not in use. Had to purchase additional cart to place it on, since it is also too tall to fit into my cabinet shelves as well."
5,perfect,we use this for bread and pizza dough mostly. It works great. I'm glad because I would freak out if I had the problems others have had.
2,Junk Electronic Speed Control,"Hi,When it is working, this appliance is great, but in the last 3 years, I had to replace the electronic speed control three times. The funny thing is that KitchenAid, doesn't even carry it as a spare part, (I guess they would rather sell you a new mixer all over again :) )The first time, I really did scramble to find one from a third party and it cost me U$ 67.00 with shipping.Speed control #2 did last a little less than a year and I just had to replace it again.This last year, my wife used the mixer maybe 5 times. This time, I got speed control #3through Amazon.com for U$ 38.00.The electronic on this mixer is made from the cheapest components money can buy; it seems to degrade slowly by itself even if it isn't being used.....It is a far cry from the rugged unit KitchenAid is marketing. Good news; 2 years after installing unit #3 our mixer is still going..."
4,"Absolutely a peach, watch for pits","This mixer is attractive, well designed, and a joy to use. I was expecting a little more from the legendary kitchenaid as the mechanism isn't as silky and tight as a high end product should feel but it is still functions great and is a bargain for the price. The whisk attachment arrived defective but a quick phone call had a good one at my door in a week. All in all I would definitely buy one again."
1,DON'T BUY A KITCHEN AID!!,"DON'T BUY A KITCHEN AID!!! We use our Kitchen Aid professional 600 mixer weekly to make bread, cookies, and pasta--NORMAL HOME USE. Ours lasted 1 year and 8 months. I called customer service and they said outside of the one year warranty there is NO service. This is an expensive mixer. It didn't even last 2 years. BUY SOMETHING ELSE. Please be warned that this machine does not last and is not worth the money!"
2,Creates a big mess,"No matter how carefully I turn this on and how slowly I use it, the ingredients are always spread around the kitchen. The cover KitchenAid suggests has a big opening on one side, so everything flies out of that. The mixer does a nice job, but I hate to use it because of all the mess it creates."
4,"Better, but not strong enough for making 2 loaves","I like the Pro 600 better than the Classic I previously used. It has it's strengths in most kitchen tasks, but it is still not quite up to my expectations when making a double batch of bread dough. I expected the motor/transmission to be quieter under load with less vibration, and though it does complete the job, it's noisy and stressed. I bought this on a one day sale for around $220 with rebate, a fantastic deal! Price considered this is a good mixer and easily does the other kitchen mixing jobs I have."
5,last mixer I'll ever buy!,"Making bread is so easy now! I use my mixer for mashing potatoes, whipping up dips, kneading bread... and so on! My husband is loving all the new recipes I'm trying and I'm loving how easy it has become to try them.I will be purchasing a meat grinding, pasta making, and citrus juicing attachment for it soon."
5,I love my mixer!,"I made butter in no time flat, much faster than my old Sunbeam (which I liked too, don't get me wrong) and my hand-mixer. I made two recipes already from the book it comes with, the peanut butter and the sugar cookies. Both were perfect!I'm so glad I have my mixing-beast!"
3,Quality not like it used to be,"I bought the mixer on Cyber Monday and thought I was getting a great deal. It arrived today and when I turned it on without the bowl or beater, it made loud clanking noises. It sounded like loose gears or something inside. After reading the reviews about the plastic parts, it is being returned tomorrow. I also do not want to deal with any problems in getting my $50 rebate. I own two smaller Kitchenaide mixers and love them. Apparently they are not being manufactured like they used to be, like so many other companies' products. Good thing Amazon has such great customer service."
5,Excellent quality and beautifully made,"By some to the reviews I read, I was afraid it was going to be monster size. However, it is the perfect size for any kitchen. It does everything it promises with ease. Excellent quality and beautifully made. Be aware that when making small batches, the 3qt bowl and combo whip comes in handy. It fits the Professional 600 model like a glove, see link below.KitchenAid 3qt Bowl and Combi Whip"
5,LOVE IT,Love the mixer! Have wanted one for YEARS and with it being the Deal of the Day- plus a rebate It was a steal!!!
2,Jumbo jet sound,"I have a cake decorating company. So I spend a lot of time baking. I have a kenwood but business expanded so I needed another mixer. I went for the Kitchenaid as I heard a lot of good reviews about the brand. However, I am using it for a while now and I'm totally not satisfied. The thing makes a noice as if a jet is taking off!!! I cannot hear someone talk if the person was standing next to me.Next to that the kitchenaid does not completely mix everything. It leaves a lot of chunks behind. Which you'll find in your cakebatter after your cake is baked.So I would nog recommend the kitchenaid 6Q. Instead go for the kenwood. You'll pay a bit more but it will be worth it. It is much more quiet, steady and it doesn't leave unmixed flower behind."
1,Extremely LOUD!,"I have had a smaller KitchenAid mixer for many years and love it. I couldn't wait to get a larger one in order to make larger batches of bread. However, the motor has a very high pitch and screams like a banshee! You need to wear hearing protection with this loud machine. I am sending it back and looking for other alternatives to make bread."
1,Piece of junk,"I ordered this mixer and when I first used it it had a loud ""grinding"" noise. I called KitchenAid and they said they couldn't hear it over the phone so I kept the mixer and, since I very seldom use it, (I have an artisian that I use for everyday) I just ignored the sound. The second time I used the mixer it shut off and got very warm. Now it won't come on for several minutes after you turn it on and shuts down within two minutes after you turn it on. I got this to make bread with and it is useless. This is my third KitchenAid (bought my daughter one when she moved out) because I have loved the Artisian. I am very disappointed!"
3,Not what I expected,I have been disappointed with the noise that this mixer makes. It sounds like a washing machine. I have always owned Kitchenaid mixers just not as big.
4,envy,"I work in food service, I bought for home use, I told boss& coworkers what I was getting & the price I was paying they all envied my great find. Sadly, I haven't got to test it yet, works' had a hold on my time."
4,Beefy Beauty,I've had the 4.5qt KitchenAid Stand Mixer and used it weekly for 16+ years. When it died I decided to upgrade to the 6qt version. Wow. It is beautiful. The additional capacity is wonderful. The power control of the different speeds is great. I can make so many recipes without risk of splash or spill over. It is a beefy machine and is just an inch too tall to fit on my kitchen counter tucked under the cabinets.One thing I miss about my 4.5qt machine is the tilt-head. The tilt-head allows me to lift the beater out of the bowl yet contain the drips that come off the beater. The 6qt design one lowers the bowl rather than lifting the head and there isn't enough clearance with the lowered bowl to easily remove the beater without disturbing the contents of the bowl. This is the only reason I'm giving this product a rating of 4 stars rather than 5.
5,Amazing product.,"I've been a long time fan of many programs on the food network and they seem to always use this thing. While I realize that is probably advertising (and let's face it, it works) I went ahead and grabbed this. I had wanted one for a while, and at $220 I couldn't refuse.Let me just say this works exactly as it should. It's an amazing piece of hardware. It blends, mixes, whips everything I throw at it and it's fairly easy to clean and maintain.The only mark I would say about this, is that it is really really loud. You don't hear it on the shows cause they have the magic of editing, but this thing screams, especially at high speeds. I would give it a 4.5 stars but that didn't seem to be an option. Even though it is loud, I love it."
5,KitchenAid Pro 600,This was purchased as a gift for my wife. She loves it. Has all the power that was lacking in her other mixer and the 6 quart bowl is great. You have lots of room to put things in and mix them up without it getting all over the counter and the lid that goes on so you can pour things in is a great addition. Would highly recommend this to anyone wanting a heavy duty type mixer.
5,Would recommend to a friend.,"I bought this for my wife, but I bake bread and use the dough hook. I actually enjoy kneading bread, but this mixer and dough hook work so well, that it is a time saver and eliminates some of the mess."
2,Does not hold up to everyday use,I believe Kitchen Aid has some quality issues to work out. I used my Kitchen aid almost daily-- I did not misuse it. I made a lot of bread and other things. After 1 1/2 years the gears have gone out on my Kitchen Aid. Prior to this Kitchen Aid I had a lesser model and before the year was up that one also broke. It was replaced but broke the 2nd time after the warranty was up.
2,Not Hobart quality,"For years I used the old Hobart kitchenaid mixer with great satisfaction. I used it so long that the carbons had to be replaced. In those years I had only one repair--of an electrical part connected to the switch. I bought this new ""professional"" model because my many attachments for the old mixer will fit the new. Shortly after I got the new mixer I had to return it for replacement. The gears failed. Now after a year of so of intermittent but serious use (nothing that would have strained my old mixer), the gears make a loud click every so many revolutions. Many cookbooks (Julia Child, etc.) recommend speed 4 for bread dough, but the new kitchenaid recommends speed one or 2--a sign, I believe of lesser quality. I'm disappointed, but feel somewhat trapped by all the attachments I have that will work only with kitchenaid. If I were young and buying a mixer, I'd look elsewhere."
1,PLASTIC,"There is a plastic gear housing under the metal cover. That plastic housing garbage has broken on me twice in the last 3 months under normal wear. I would think a ""professional"" grade appliance might have a crucial item like that made of metal! Get a clue Kitchen Aid! Way to save a few bucks you jerks!"
5,Wow!,It is amazing! I am so pleased with my bargain! Considering it is 400.00 in the local retail stores in my area! I use it all the time!I recommend it for the serious baker!
4,four years and counting,"Me and my wife have used this blender for 4 years and have done everything from cake baking, bread making (low volume) and pastries. We upgraded to the meat grinder to make our own ground beef and loved that attachment as well. Our only issue with this blender was only having one bowl and cleaning the binding of the handle, there is a gap in there that takes time ot get clean if you get stuff in it ( we have 2 kids, they love to help).Overall very satisfied with the money spent on this item."
5,Professional Mixer,Love it! Love it! I order one for me one for a gift....problem was rebate offer. I had both shipped to one address but rebate was one rebate per address. I contacted AMAZON and they fixed the rebate problem...Thank You so much Amazon..the rebate made a big difference in the price. The mixer...well that speaks for itself. I've use many different brands and this one is the best. Enough power to make those Choc. Chip cookies that take so much power to mix.
5,Nice finish!,"I just received my mixer so I can not say anything about it's functioning...although I am confident I will be pleased. I just wanted to remark about the ""licorice"" color option. It is a matte finish similar to a titanium color...it is really classy looking and will look great with my other kitchen appliances. I could not be happier...not to mention I got a great deal on Amazon!"
3,kitchenaid mixer,I like this mixer alot. The thing I didnt like about it is top doesnt rotate up so that its easier to get the bowl out.
3,perfect stand mixer,"I must tell you that I am not a bit disappointed that I bought this mixer, it really lightened my fruit cake baking in Christmas. It creams sugar and butter very well, If you know how to bake a real Jamaican fruit cake, you know you must cream your butter and sugar until it is light and fluffy. With this mixer you can cream four (4) pounds of sugar and butter at any given time. This mixer is very fast and efficient, it takes at least quater the time than that of a hand mixer. I love my new mixer,to my surprise it even matches the other appliances in my kitchen. thank you amazon. Delivery time was also efficient."
3,Consider your needs before buying this model,"This is a great product _if you need to mix large batches of dough_. It is powerful and reliable. However, the bowl is large (for large batches - get it?) and so if you mix up one or two loaves of bread at a time, the dough hook barely catches the dough. In fact a one-loaf batch is impossible; it simply lies inert at the bottom of the bowl while the dough hook rotates over it. If you make four loaves at a time (I refer to a one-pound or so loaf), then this is definitely the machine for you."
3,Bigger is not necessarily better,"When I purchased the Kitchen Aid KP26M1XOB Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, I really thought I was going to be so much happier with this than my older, smaller one. What I did not realize was that there is no smaller bowl that fits this for the times when you need both sizes. Secondly, I found that taking the beater out was more difficult as well. Yes, it holds more and doubling or tripling recipes is a little easier, but it still makes the same mess even with the plastic cover, I still use a towel to cover it. Then I was also faced with the fact that this machine is bigger and does not fit under the cabinet so I cannot leave it on my counter which means everytime I want to use it, I have to take it from another place and bring it into my kitchen. So the long and short of this is, the other one is better for me."
3,not totally satisfied,"we purchased pro 600 primarily to make bread,up till now we were using a 30 year old black and decker mixer which worked extremely well, unfortunatelu the glass bowl started chipping at the edges and the blades started to chip and rust the 6 quart capacity of the pro appealed because we could make a double batch which we tried and capacity is fine but the dough hook does not do a good job of kneading the dough, depending on the consistency of the dough it either spreads all over the bowl without getting the kneading action or it sticks in one tight ball around the hook and does not knead....the mixers with two blades do a much better job of kneading dough and are much much cheaper"
1,My electronic speed control decided to fail.,"The 600 Professional is far from being the mixer my mother used to have. It's built in China now and it shows. The speed control is electronic now and decided to fail at the worst time. Adding flour to the bowl, the mixer decided to go into top speed and flung flour everywhere. Eventually the mixer shut down on it's own before I could unplug it. This is suppose to be a professional model, it's really just a large home appliance. It's not built like the truck they used to be. This isn't a highly used machine, maybe once every other month. We expected it to last for generations as most older models did. Not the case any longer. It's no longer American made and it shows. Don't waste your money on these models, your money can be spent wisely going somewhere else."
2,Not What i expected,"I bought this mixer cause its the biggest of kitchenaind, however i can only make 1 pound of dough at a time and even with that little weight it gets overheated!!!!"
1,Smoke came out with Burnt Smell,"I bought the mixer as a Christmas gift for a membe of my family. When we started making a dough according to the instruction, smoke came out of the mixer with burnt smell. I thought maybe the problem would go away with repeated usage. We then used it a couple of times more, the same thing happened. I gave up and had to return it. I really hope Kitchen Aid can improve the quality of the product or make the quality more consistent."
3,Not what I was hoping for... Disappointed,Oooo.... Kitchenaid... you have managed to disappoint me. Summing it up... its too loud and needs a tilt head. I returned it :(
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! AND NEVER SENT ME MY GOODS,I place an order on the 18th of march for a kitchen aid mixer. It is now the 11th of april and they have not returned my emails nor have I receved my buy.!!I would buy a kitchen aid but never order from this company again.
2,Kitchenaid Professional 6,"I just found out that my Kitchenaid Professional 6 mixer needs a repair costing $135. I have used this mixer for 5 years lightly and this is the 2nd one. The first one was replaced within one year after purchase. I am not impressed. The unit is not worth the price they ask for it. Don't purchase it, check out your other choices. I am very disappointed."
3,"Nancee J. Swartz, 27, Philadelphia, PA","Nancee J. Swartz, 27, Philadelphia, PA. I own the KitchenAid Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Series Stand Mizer and it is a very useful appliance for blending and baking mixes. It is easy to clean and comes with instructions for usage and cleaning. I recommend it as an addition for any kitchen."
1,Disappointed with their best product.,"I have used old hand helds and other kitchen all in one units for decades and finally bought my own ""KitchenAid's"" best..... very disappointed. This product is very pretty, runs very sweetly, and is possibly the least useful tool in my kitchen now. What it is really only good at is mixing bread dough. It has the power to do a great job! Don't make cookies or anything like a cake with it; it leaves so much room between the bowl and the mixer that you have more to scrape, over and over before you are done than is worth the effort to use it. Get the hand mixer out, much better, so why buy it? This basic design has not been substancially improved or changed for 30 years."
1,"$300 Paperweight, Insulted by Kitchenaid","I was so excited to try out my new fancy mixer. Raised the bowl and found that the flat paddle head was hitting the bottom of the bowl. No problem, read the instructions and there is a screw to adjust for this. Which, unfortunately, did nothing. Not higher, not lower, nada. OK, so I read the manual about returns. They say they'll replace it and pay for shipping. If they do that, I'll be reasonably pleased. But y'know what really ticked me off? In discussing bad machines, they use the phrase ""failed"" mixer. In quotes. Like it's not really broken, the customer is just an idiot. Like I can't tell whether it's working or not. Like I can't read the instructions and make the adjustment as indicted. I am not an idiot and I don't appreciate being insulted. Wish I hadn't bought this thing."
3,KitchenAid Pro 600 Stand Mixer,"Product had a $50 rebate offer at time of purchase on Amazon. However, no rebate paperwork accompany mixer...no $50 rebate. Could have bought at local store at same price instead of waiting for the shipment. As for product, haven't used it yet since we've just moved to our new residence. Will post later on it's function."
1,Sad sad sad,How could I possibly rate this product. Arrived without a power plug and not wired to be used in Australia. What a real fizzer this turned out to be. My husband and I were soooooo looking forward to receiving this amazing machine. Huge plans for lots of baking and experimenting with it only to be sorely disappointed. Why on earth would any company supply a machine that is not compatible with the electrical systems of the country it was being sent to.Hard lesson learned never shop outside of Australia. Cheap may not always be what it seems. :(
4,Delivery,I just ordered this Item and in less than 48 hours my wife received it. Perfect timing. I will update this comment later to insure the quality of the item meets my expectations.
5,LOVE IT!!!,"I love this mixer.I thought I would have to purchase a used commercial mixer to make my bread.Now I don't and I am so pleased. I like to make 4 loaves of bread at one time. As I use fresh ground whole wheat,I was pleasantly surprised at the power of the mixing and kneading of the KitchenAid. The stability of the mixer while kneading was also a pleasant surprise."
1,great product but $50 cahback never materialized!,"The KitchenAid KP26M1XMR Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, Meringue was fine, but the bait was a $50 give back for purchase on that day for that item. I filled out all of the paperwork and mailed it. This is a weakness with Amazon fulfillment. If you do not get something promised you at a ""bait"" there is no way to rectify it later. This is just a warning to other buyers. It reflects badly on Amazon, not the manufacturer."
3,Long time user,"I have been a long time user of the KitchenAid stand mixer, over 45 years. I really like this purchase and will continue to use KitchenAid mixers. It is a great product but there are some thing I wish were different such as the noise level. This is my 5th KitchenAid Stand Mixer and I have to say that my first was the best. It was made by Hobart and was a great machine. I keep buying KitchenAid because I have the attachments and extra bowls. If you are a first time purchaser of a stand mixer I would look into other brands to see if this one is the one you really want."
1,Need repaire after 10 Months,"Bought professional 600 Series 6-Quart in January 2011. It ONLY works for making fluffy cakes, anything else it gets locked and overheat easily. Gears are not even working now. I read some negative reviews about KitchenAid before I bought it, but I thought ""professional"" should be strong enough for home bakery. But now I had paid my lessons. Never KitchenAid Again!!!"
3,Professional mixer,"The experience with Amazon was excellent, The mixer overall is good. The beater mount to the drive shaft is very loose"
4,Loud but great,"I've been wanting this mixer for such a long time - it's very loud, but works great.....the 1st attachment that I bought was terrible - do not buy the small pasta attachment - it makes terrible pasta - too dense because you cannot control the thickness"
4,Rebate forms?,"I have just received my 600 Series mixer and so far am thrilled with it, however, I purchased it in part due to the rebate offer. Can anyone tell me where to look for the rebate coupon? Thank you!!!"
1,The gears stripped out after three months. Kitchaid said our fault and would not honor warranty,"My wife was making a single batch of bread dough in the machine. Mixer book said it should be able to handle 14 cups of flour but she was only using 8. Towards the end of the cycle the dough hook stopped rotating but motor continued to run. Contacted Kitchen aid warranty department and they told us we had overloaded the product, you can only use 8 cups total ingredients w/ bread flour. KA said they would not honor the warranty. Out $400 + accessories after just 90 days."
1,"Disappointing, lack of power and completely dead after 4 months","Save your money and look for another mixer. We bought this, it worked for 4 months and then it died, the engine makes noise as if it is working but the beater does not move at all, looks like a broken ""clutch"" or something. During the 4 months that it did work it was not as strong as advertised and for bread or croissant dough it will violently shake and fail to mix, sort of move a bit, get stuck, move a bit, get stuck. The engine also gets hot and smells, very bad design, don't waste your money on it!"
4,Powerful mixer and easy to use.,"The professional 600 KitchenAid mixer is the first stand mixer I've ever purchased. During the holidays we used it to make all types of treats from double chocolate cookies, to lemon ricotta shortbread cookies. It's a FANTASTIC machine that is easy to use and makes mixing a breeze. Highly recommend. Next on the list, homemade whipped cream using the wire whisk attachment. YUM! Would have given the mixer five stars, but this model is from 2011 and the 2012 version has a few minor changes that now after seeing would have been nice to have."
4,Wonderful Item for a Great Price!,"Great Item! I love it! I use it to make Cakes, Pies, to mix Meat, etc. It does a great job! The only drawback is that this item's stand is really heavy so it is hard to move!"
5,KitchenAid 600,I purchased my first KitchenAid 600 stand mixer. It is a dream. The motor is so powerful that it takes no time to mix batters. You need to cut mixing time because of the powerful motor you can over mix delicate batters. I would recommend with out reservations.
5,ease in the kitchen,I bought the kitchenaid kp26m1xnp 600 series stand mixer and the accessory package for my fiancee to make life in the kitchen easier. It has worked out great.She love all the power it has and the versatility. If anyone does a lot of baking it's the perfect machine.
5,Great Product.,"I will first admit that I ordered this for my wife as a Christmas present so I am not actually using the product.My wife has used this mixer a couple of times and I did once to mix up box brownies. The mixer worked perfectly and didn't have any problems and did a great job with the bread, brownies and cookies she made.The only things is initially when she turned it on it was louder than I expected. I did some research and found that the mixer was made with metal parts and the sort since she has never had one before I am assuming the noise is normal as it doesn't sound like there is anything being damaged just a bit louder than I expected."
5,Great Mixer for even Greater price,Could not believe I found this great mixer from a well established company for such a great price new. It works better than I had expected. The soft start is wonderful..One downfall though......having this mixer MAY add additional pounds from using too often.
2,I gave mine away.,I was very frustrated with this mixer. I was using it to manufacture dog treats and it kept overheating and turning off. Not good for productivity. I finally went back to the 5 qt. and gave this one away.
1,Weaksauce,"Very noisy. Do not buy if you live in an apartment. It gets way too hot, much hotter than my old Kitchen-Aid from the 80s. I ""upgraded"" to the bigger bowl and find the lack of power disappointing. Seriously, though, I cannot begin to describe how this thing moans and screeches even when under no stress. Welcome to the 21st century, people, where junk reigns supreme over quality and durability.UPDATE: The POS is done. Shipping her back tomorrow and intend to get a full refund."
5,Great product! Great Service!,"This is a replacement for a smaller KitchenAid that is still working. It was my Christmas gift to myself, and a great buy. After a couple uses, the new one started to make a screeching noise. I called Customer Service. In less than a week, a new replacement one arrived with prepaid postage sticker to return the old. Kitchenaid Customer service rep was efficient and courteous. Such a nice Christmas experience. New one works great!"
3,Wish the Metal Bowl was thicker,"Overall good product design and motor power, but I believe that:1) The Stainless Steel Bowl should be thicker.2) The control knob sturdier.3) The cheap plastic pouring shield is a waste. I do not use it at all. It is very flimsy and comes off easily.Expensive as it is, for another few extra bucks the manufacturer could have made a much superior product. Why call it a professional Stand Mixer if you have cheap materials attached to the product."
3,review,"The mixer is fine, but 2 of the 3 attachments did not fit. They mailed me 2 new ones. The new spiral one worked, but the flat beater still didn't fit. Finally they mailed another one which was not metal that worked."
1,Motor failed after 5 years,I did not use my mixer for bread often but managed to kill the motor with a small batch of challah. At KA's authorized repair center it's going to cost $140 for repair and KitchenAid can do nothing for me or even guarantee the replacement parts. I am unhappy with the customer service.
2,Another Plastic transmission cover victim,"Powerful, but noisy mixer. KitchenAid won't sell the replacement cover for the plastic housing that broke. Of course, it's out of warranty... Their only solution is to have me ship my unit for repair (they refuse to either acknowledge the design problem or sell the part to fix it). Looks like it is back to the disposable mixers for me. Their product support is horrendous. I will never pay a single dollar to a company that hides behind its mistakes and refuses to acknowledge the problem that it obviously knows about. It would have been so easy to make me a happy customer...but even refusing to sell parts that are poorly designed in inexcusable. To add insult to injury, the rep spent the last 2 minutes trying to sell me a refurb and accessories for my broken mixer. KitchenAid: Two thumbs down, one finger up."
2,Some flaws,"What I don't understand about a $300 machine is why in multiple cakes I've made, even after I do at least a couple of scrapings is that there's always a layer that manages to stick to the bottom. Each time I have to finish up the mixing by hand, which is NOT what I am looking for when I pay a couple of hundred dollars for a quality mixer."
5,Powerhouse mixer,This Mixer is a workhorse. The Professional 600 series is by far the mixer that should be on anyone's counter that wants to do serious baking and wants it to be easier that fighting that old underpowered mixer. I bougght this for my wife becaue I smoked her hand held mixer that was plenty years old while making the Cool Whip/Cake Mix cookies. This kitchenaid has all the power I would think you would want in a home mixer. Watch closely for sales on this one. Plenty of horsepower in the 575 watt. Great Colors. Easy to attach and remove attachments.
5,Absolutely Love It!,"This is the second KitchenAid I've owned. As with the first (that ended up at my daughter's), I am extremely happy and satisfied."
5,Heaven.....,"This mixer was bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is a professional baker. She adores it - it does everything but the dishes! Great product! Shipped it to our U.S. address for free shipping - it doesn't get better! I bought it, and I didn't even have to carry it home from the store."
1,Disappointed,"My husband just tried to use my less than 2 year old Pro 600 to grind chicken. The power level was noticeably reduced and before he had done 3 quarts, metal filings and grease were being flung from the mixer head!! And it was way too hot. He stopped and investigated and found the metal gears were worn out!! I have never done anything more than 8 cups of flour and had even stopped that because it got too hot. Bought a BOSCH UNIVERSAL PLUS 800W to use. Have used it for a year and love it! It costs about $100 less and does 9 pounds of dough easily and doesn't overheat.The KitchenAid Pro 600 mixer is a huge disappointment and dent in my pocketbook. It took my husband several years to convince me I needed a KitchenAid and now he's sorry he did. KitchenAid is no longer a standard bearer in kitchen appliances. Where have all the good appliances gone? Ones that used to last for 10 years or better."
5,Where have you been all my life?!,"Seriously this has changed my life, my family are very clean, paleo eaters bc of my sons autism so we mass produce food & freeze it & this makes life SOOOO much easier. It was hard to pay so much $$ but in the end I am very happy with my purchase"
2,Item arrived damaged,"I received this mixer as a Christmas present. I have been wanting/researching the item for several years and my husband surprised me with one. I was so excited until we took it out of the box and found a big dent on the top of the mixer. Since the motor is directly below, we do not know if there is damage internally as well. I am bummed because I can not ""exchange"" the mixer. Rather, I have to return it then wait 4 weeks for a refund to then hope there are still some left and order another one. In the future, I won't order items of this nature if it's not directly through Amazon. I will update my review if I have to pay for shipping this damaged item."
5,WOW,I did not know what I was missing until I used my KitchenAid mixer. It makes food preparation much easier. Remember that this sits a little higher and may not fit under all kitchen cabinets.This is a perfect gift for someone special.
1,Dont buy if you use it more than once a week!!!!!!!,"I have this unit replace once and is broken again now waiting for the other one. They removed my warranty because i am using it for selling purpose, they say they told the people but i didnt read anything about that before buying, it came in the manual after buying...... Yeah, i was honest with them, also i asked advice in order to not break the unit again but they say nothing to me. The only thing they say is THIS UNIT IS TENT TO BE USED ONCE A WEEK WITH NO TOO MUCH FLOUR...... So you make your decision."
4,love it,"I love the kitchenaid professional 600 series 6 quart stand mixer. I've used it many times now since i bought it, the only complain i would have is that it makes a too much noise, but beside that i would recommend this product."
5,KitchenAid KP26M1XER,"Powerful motor, easy to use, speeds up mixing time significantly over other models. This mixer is fantastic if you can afford it."
4,very pleased,excellent product - a little noisy - sounds like it's working too hard but it does a very good job - guess the noise is all that horsepower working
5,Killer KitchenAid at BEST price,"cookies cookies cookies, thought my wife may be pissed for me getting her an ""appliance"" for Christmas. no chance, she loved it, her friends love it, our baby sitter loves it (so weird). and it was the best price I could find after 30 days of research."
1,KitchenAid-less,"I have a Professional mixer that used to work well. I didn't need the Professional model, but I figured that I should ever need it I'd be ready. The mixer was working well, albeit loud, then it got louder, I started hearing grinding noises, and then it died.I called KitchenAid customer service, and they repeated their warranty policy over and over, offered to sell me a new mixer, or have it repaired ay my exppense.My mother's KitchenAid mixer has nowhere near the power of this mixer, she uses her mixer for heavier duty loads, and it works as well as it did the day she bought it.KitchenAid doesn't stand behind their products, so I won't buy another one of their products, ever."
5,My Kitchen Work Horse,"If you use your stand mixer (or want to) to do anything bigger than whip cream or mix cake batter, don't even bother with the smaller mixers. This heavy-duty work horse does it all for me.. I bake bread 2 times a week and my machine is constantly in use.. from mixing meatloaf to grinding pork to make my own breakfast sausage.. and of course, for bread baking.I read another review where someone said that after 15 minutes their bread dough made the machine stop? This has never happened to me and quite frankly, I'm shocked that I read that. I make double batches of bread and love the corkscrew design of the bread hook.Don't bother with the lower wattage mixer.. spend the extra $100 and buy the pro.. you'll never be sorry! From delicate creams and meringues, pasta making and bread mixing.. it's perfect for any job."
5,THE.BEST.MIXER.EVER.,"I love my kitchenaid. And to be honest, I haven't heard anyone say anything but this. It's great quality, durable and reliable. I can't wait to start baking! As a heads up to any new owners...read the manual about changing up your recipe for this specific mixer. It's stronger, and mixes faster, and they give you hints on adjusting mixing times, etc. for this mixer. I was too excited to try it out for the first time to do that... :)It just made for a more dense Red Velvet Cake... Oh well...more time to play on it while I correct! I recommend this product!"
5,Best present ever,"My hubby surprised me on my birthday a few years ago, and this mixer has more than exceeded my expectations. We got it on sale with a good rebate, so I would definitely price-watch for a while before spending the money. It is my can't-live-without kitchen tool, and I sometimes wonder what I did before it arrived. :P That said, if you're a newlywed perhaps, and/or not really big into baking and such, I definitely think the Artisan or Classic stand mixers are more than adequate for everyday use. My only (teensy-tiny) complaint is that the attachments with the Pro mixer are not dishwasher-safe; but again, it's not that big of a deal to me."
4,Works as advertised,Makes cooking easier for my wife. She likes to cook and anything that will make that easier is a plus. The machine is easy to use and easy to change out the attachments. No problems reported.
4,My Experience,"Product works, but the trim band around head unit is loose and there was no warranty registration card in the box. Not totally pleased."
5,Great Buy,I am very pleased with my purchase of a Kitchen Aid Professional 600 series 6-quart Mixer. I saved at least $150.00 over after-Christmas sales at department stores. I am sold on the ease with which one can shop on-line. It certainly saves on my time and energy and gasoline.
2,Not worth the money,"We bought the Pro 600 in 2004, as a ""splurge"" to replace an older, smaller (but reliable) KA. Right away we noticed the annoying, high pitched whine so many have mentioned. We also noticed lighter-weight bowls, beaters, just not the same quality as our old KA (the ""pro"" model of its time, in 1988). After not quite 4 years (compared to the nearly 20 the old machine lasted), the gears have abruptly stripped and the machine is completely shot. We would argue with KitchenAid about replacing it, even though it is out of warranty -- except that we have not the slightest desire to have another of these ""new"" (and cheaper!) Kitchenaids. We will look to more professional grade kitchen equipment for our next mixer. These are high-priced ""gadgets"" indeed if they're only going to last a few years..."
2,"LOUD, LOUD, LOUD",Take a listen before you buy this mixer. It is so loud. It emits a lovely high pitched motor noise that frightens my dog even on low speeds. I called KitchenAid and they said it's normal. Yuck. I'm returning this mixer and buying another brand.They also don't recommend using a higher speed than 2 for dough. Huh?
4,Bella mi Batidora,"KitchenAid KP26M1PSL Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, Silverexcelente producto hasta los momento se ha portado de maravilla.....entrega satisfactoria..."
1,Waste Of Money,"Sure, we all loved them, at first. Within four years, mine, my mother's, and a close friend's all died. The problem was identical on all three...first a few drops of oil started leaking out, which we all thought was our imagination. One or two uses later, they only went up to a low medium speed, then made clunking noise and stopped. Add that to our piles of also broken Kitchen Aid blenders and food processors, and you have a great picture of how the quality of these products has tumbled over the past five years. None of us will ever buy another Kitchen Aid product again."
2,"Very Heavy,inconvenient to use",I dont like it at all. It is very heavy and inconvenient to use to put it out and in.
3,Very noisy,Product is very noisy especially when kneading bread dough. Concerned this is going to lead to an early failure.
2,Not what I expected for the $,"I just received this mixer from my husband as a Christmas present. After using my sister's exact model, I thought I had no need to review the the instructions. Being that it's such a swanky little machine at a swanky little price, I assumed that I can put the beater in my dishwasher. Being that I can put my $60 mixer parts in the dishwasher, I assumed that the $400 would practically wash itself!!! I know, I'm at fault for assuming, but really Kitchenaid? I researched and realized that the beaters for the smaller models have the capability to be put in the dishwasher! #fail"
2,Does not cover mixer completely,"The KitchenAid cover is well made, but fails to cover the mixer completely. There is about a 1"" gap between the bottom of the cover and the countertop. It appears the cover was made for the 5-quart mixer rather than the 6-quart mixer. I purchased the 6-quart cover, and it indicated it was the 6-quart cover, but it does not fit properly. I will probably end up giving this one away to my sister who has a 5-quart, and making my own that fits properly."
4,It is really nice,"If you have ever had a Kitchen-Aid stand mixer, it takes a while to stop trying to pull the head back to disengage the bowl and mixers. This mixer looks great and works great...especially for large quanitities."
5,Purchase of the year,This has been one of our better purchases. The quality is second to none and no task is too big. Well worth the money.
5,Durable,"I have used this mixer for years! It's a work horse! I have used it for many types of foods including cakes, cookies and stiff breads. It performs superbly even with heavy bread doughs. I can quickly mix double batches of brad dough in the large mixing bowl. I bought a second steel bowl for convenience. The second bowl helps to separate wet & dry ingeredients. I highly recommend this mixer!"
5,Kitchenaid KP26M1XWH Prof. 00 Mixer,I have owned a Kitchenaid stand mixer for 42 years and it still ran perfectly. I wanted a new larger one and WOW is it large. Runs great.
3,Oddly Bad,"1. Won't whip small quantities of egg whites. Since I seldom whip large quantities of egg whites, this is a problem. Does your recipe call for the whites of two eggs? Forget it.2. By the same token, care to make aioli? Forget about it.Otherwise, it does most things well. But, for the money I'd rather have a machine that did the small things as well as the big things. I'm going to swap the 600 for the 500 that I have at my restaurant. We do bigger things at the restaurant. Overall, I think the 500 is a better machine."
4,Kitchenaid 600 series mixer rebate does apply. I just got a return call from them,I just got off the phone with the rebate center. 937-264-8018. They called me back after I left them my info a few hrs ago. They told me that they are in fact honoring the rebate. I made several calls after getting conflicting info and was told that they were waiting on Mgmt approval. I guess that approval came through. The direct No. for the rebate center is: 888-474-2457. Hope this helps[...]
1,Stopped working after just 10 uses.,"Wish I had read all of the reviews on this before purchasing. I was enticed into paying extra for the ""professional"" series with the expectation of more power, better components, etc. We've only used it 10 times over the last 2-3 years and it now doesn't have the torque to mix anything but air. Of course it's out of warranty. Customer service was friendly but not helpful. Referred me to a few service centers. I don't believe in the KA name anymore. For the cost of shipping, diagnostic and repair, I'll just buy a cheaper mixer. It will probably last just as long."
1,Don't Bother,"The real measure of a mixer's strength isn't what it can deal with once, it's what it can deal with day-to-day. And these modern kitchenaid mixers simply can't put up with regular use in any real way. I bought one of the cheap Artisan series mixers and used it to make bread (2-3 loaves/week) for nearly two years, at which point it broke under the strain. Then I bought this model under the idea that it's 14-cup ""flour power"" would be more than enough to handle making single loaves of bread with only 2-3 cups of flour. Boy was I wrong. This model has broken under the strain in only 7 months, and I've even been using it significantly less than I did the Artisan.If you want/need a kitchenaid mixer for light duty things like cookies, cakes, whipping egg whites, or the wide array of attachments you can put on them, then go and buy one of the cheaper models. If you want a mixer that will hold up to the ""strain"" of baking a loaf of bread each week, then look elsewhere."
1,A Disappointment,"I was kneading bread six cups worth and the gears went out. Now I need to have it fixed, I am a loyal Kitchenaid customer, all my appliances are from the Pro Series. I have wanted a kitchenaid mixer ever since I was a kid and we used one in culinary school. This model is a disappointment to the Kitchenaid name. I called customer service and that was an equal disappointment."
2,Not so happy,"This was maybe used 5 times in a year. It stops working three days past warranty. Kitchen Aid will do ""a one time courtesy"" and replace it with a refurbished one. That's lame and so is this Pro 600 mixer for not lasting at all. Yes, I operated it under proper care outlined in the manual. Now I know why there are so many refurbished ones online! Downright BS policy with Kitchen Aid."
3,KitchenAid Professional 600 series,"While the mixer does it's job, I'm sorry I didn't get a model with a tilt head. The bowl is hard to scrape down and batters etc can get stuck under the bowl rim.It's an ok model but not fabulous.It alo vibrates like heck and the power takes a second to kick in. Kinda disappointing for the money."
3,Grey Mashed Potatoes,"I purchased a Kitchen Aid 6qt 575W Professional 600 for my mother. When I visited her shortly thereafter she made mashed potatoes for dinner. The metallic beater rubs off on whatever she makes, thus, we had grey mashed potatoes. I have a smaller Kitchen Aid mixer and I love it. But then again my beater is plastic coated. Now my search is on to obtain a plastic beater for my mother's mixer so we do not have to eat the grey mashed potatoes anymore!"
5,"If you bake bread, this is your mixer!",This is an amazing workhorse of a mixer. I bake bread weekly and this makes easy work of it. I use a 7 cup of flour recipe and no longer need to kneed by hand. The only thing I would change is the aluminium hook & paddle as they are not machine washable.
4,Would recommend this appliance,"Powerful motor. Works well on all tasks. The only issue is sometimes the bowl is hard to lock in place. It has to be done just right. Overall, am very pleased with this appliance. The price on Amazon was better than any place I looked. I would recommend this product."
5,It's everything I wanted!,I've used a 4.5 quart Kitchenaid for about 9 yrs and I really wanted the bigger one... The 6 quart makes my life alot easier. I think it's another AWESOME product from Kitchenaid!!!
5,Best Kitchen Aid decision yet!,"I have wanted to upgrade my Kitchen Aid mixer for awhile and started shopping around. I knew that I needed the Professional Series Mixer to meet my needs, but was reluctant to spend that much money. Amazon ran a fabulous deal on just the mixer I wanted, so I bought it. I was also nervouse about buying such a large appliance off of the internet worried it would be shipped damaged. It came in just fine and so far all is well. I love my large my Kitchen Aid Mixer!"
3,Product quality after 4 years of ownership,"I've owned this machine for 4 years now and am looking at a $175 bill to replace all the gears. According to the service guy the 600 series is the only one with metal gears which means that if I didn't have this model it probably would have worn out sooner. I make bread 2-3 times a month, plus use it for lighter duty things such as mixing batters. I am mostly happy with this mixer, but it is really not up to the task of making whole wheat bread on a regular basis. 2 loaves is the most it can make at one time-- more than this with whole wheat flour in the dough and the machine can not knead it enough, it gets hot and shuts off.If you are going to make a lot of whole wheat or partial whole wheat bread then you can probably expect a service bill on this in your future. If not, then this mixer will probably be a great addition to your kitchen."
5,Great strong product!,"Compared to mixers with similar power, you can bet on keeping this one a long time. Very Heavy, Very Sturdy, and Strong!"
3,Good mixer IF...,"This is a great mixer for SMALL batches of bread dough IF it's not heavy (like bagels). It absolutely does not have the ""flour power"" they state it does. In fact, when mixing less than what they consider safe, it broke the mixer. I'm thankful for their warranty (it rocks!), but I just can't use this for what I do most.It does a wonderful job with cookies, egg whites, potatoes, meatloaf and the like, but if you're a serious bread maker and want something reliable, check out a Bosch universal mixer instead. It's not pretty, but it's a workhorse and does 12 pounds of dough at a time and never needs to rest. The Kitchenaid just doesn't have what it takes to get the job done, even for a medium batch.I sure wish the kitchenaid was better in this area, as it's a beautiful machine and works so great in other ways. Bummer."
1,Not gonna wash it,"After much drooling and review reading, I finally settled for the Pro 600 KitchenAid. I knew that this machine has sometimes bogged down so I wanted to give it a good test. I decided to try a double batch of a sweet bread dough requiring 10 cups of sugar (well below the 'Flour power' for this model) It started mixing and things were going well... until it stopped. It did not seem to labour, it just stopped. Over heated I guess. So I ended up finishing up by hand...I'll return it tomorrow."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this item. This was a Christmas gift for my wife and wish it would have not been defective. I wanted to return it and get a new one but Amazon did not have this option. However Amazon told me I could return it for a refund.Reason for return: Loud humming noise and the wire whip and flat beater struck the bottom of bowl despite making all adjustments as per instructions manual. KitchenAid, What happened to you quality inspection?"
4,KitchenAid Pro 600,We are happy with the purchase of the KitchenAid Pro 600. The Pro 600 works very well. KitchenAid mixers are a good product. We have had a KitchenAid mixer in our household for the past 32 years.
1,Save your pennies for a better mixer,"My wife bought me this mixer as a Christmas present. It was to be an upgrade from my trusty old 4.5 quart KitchenAid mixer I've had for almost twenty years. This new one doesn't deserve to wear the KitchenAid name.On the weekends I bake bread and bagels. Old trusty can plow through 5 or 6 batches of bagel dough without a problem. The new ""pro"" model can't even make it through two before switching off from overheating. Also it gives off an odor half way through the first batch. The recipe I use is from an old issue of Cook Illustrated, in the article they state they use a KitchenAid mixer. Also the recipe uses a mere 4 cups of flour.If you really want one of these I'm considering leaving mine at the end of the driveway with a FREE sign on it. May save my pennies for Hobart (they owned KitchenAid back when my old mixer was made.)"
5,Food processor,Great product. I use it a lot to make dough (aata) for making tortillas (rotis). The vessel shakes while making rotis...doesn't bother me. I wish I would have bought a smaller quart size.
4,New KitchenAid in 25 years,"We wanted a larger bowl and dediced to finally purchase a new KitchenAid after 25 years. The bowl is quite a bit larger, but much lighter. The machine itself weighs half the weight of our old one. The knob to turn on is cheap and feels flimsy. It smells like burnt rubber when it is running, this is after having it for a month over the holidays. The beaters are also much lighter in weight and we just hope that all the cutbacks on materials will hold up for 25 years, like our first one. We did keep the old one for just in case! I use it at least 2-3 times a week, so it has gotten quite a workout. We do use all the blades, especially the paddle. A double recipe of cookies fits rather nicely in the bowl, which barely fit in our prior machine. To be continued..."
5,Kitchen Aid Professional 600 mixer,This mixer is wonderful! I got it before baking Christmas cookies and used it for many batches. It worked excellently for even the sugar roll out cookie recipethat takes 6-7 cups of flour that we always had to mix by hand. Price through Amazon was also very good. I have seen the same mixer at other places for over $100 more than I paid for it.
1,Plastic gear box!,Awesome machine with plastic gear box. No accountability from manufacturer. Buyer beware! research this item before you dish out the money on this one!
5,A Monster in the kitchen!! (Work Ethic),Great tool for your kitchen it devours any task at hand. Just make sure you need it..
1,It sound like Chines lown mower.,"I had a old KithenAid I was happy with it. I needed new one after 10 years. I bought this new one,and it is a Cheaply made. It is not made like the old days. I will say by by by to KitchenAid. Never again."
1,Disappointed,"My husband purchase this KP2M1PGC KitchenAid Mixer as a gift. I was really diassapointed and wish he had bought it locally so I could return it. This model is a ""fixed' position head that will not tilt back for ease of operation. I can't blame my husband the Amazon site does not identify that this particular model is ""fixed"". Most kitchenAid mixers displayed in stores are tilt models (user friendly). Even my two daughters did not like this mixer. Do not purchase this one... you can buy the tilt model for the same price."
1,KITCHENAID,"Hi,A week ago I bought a kitchenaid mixer which has already been collected and is still not at my address. In status said: In transit and in latest event:said: incorrect address. Confirm to me what happend with this because I bought a mixer cover too and I received it on Feb, 04"
2,bait and switch,"Before I purchased the 600 series KitchenAid mixer, I would have made sure I knew exactly how to receive the promotional materials promised - a $40 debit card, a book of recipes and a magazine subscription. When I clicked for more information regarding these promotions, before I ordered the mixer, the information said that if guidelines weren't apparent, then the information would be in the box. There was no information in the box. And to attempt to go back to the orginal web site was too daunting. Through obfuscation of information the promotional perks I was promised never appeared."
5,KitchenAid - Backorder????,"I rate the product amazing, but I actually returned the product to Amazon and purchased from a retailer, because Amazon could not guaranteed me a delivery. The delivery was a window of about 7 days, and that is not sufficient for me."
5,My first stand mixer!,"I love my KitchenAid 6 Quart Pearl Metallic mixer! I got mine about a month ago. I've waited until I'm 37 to invest in one of these babies, and I wish I had done it a long time ago. It's way more fun to use than a bowl and a mixing spoon or kneading dough by hand! I've made lots of pizza dough, lots of cookies, and even mixed up some omelet eggs with this thing, all of which turned out fantastic. Make sure you keep checking daily on the price here on Amazon, because it fluctuates just like the stock market. If you see a color that you like, but it's too expensive, just wait. It'll come down in price, or maybe go up. It'll vary wildly. Supply and demand, I suppose. I highly recommend this mixer!"
1,you have got to be kidding,this product was returned within a few days of receipt.The mixer was totally unusable.The rotor shaft was sitting in the bowl when I unpacked it.This would have been my third Kitchen Aid mixer.Total garbage.
2,Broke in less then 2 years!!,"I received this mixer as a gift for Christmas 2006. In October 2008 it broke - internals gears and housing cracked. It is no longer under warranty and is a $150+ repair. I used the mixer for regular household tasks about 2 times a week - i.e., nothing out of the ordinary.I'm really disappointed - so much for my $300+ investment! Kitchen Aid customer service can do nothing for me - I'm leery of purchasing their products again. I do have the 4.5 qt. mixer that I used for 12 years and am again using now - it no longer locks but otherwise works fine. But I miss making double batches of bread, cookies, etc. GRRRRRR!!!!"
3,sad about the quality,"it does what its supposed to do but i think its lame that the mixing blades are too small for the blades, to whip egg whites i have to lift the bowel, also it has the ""i am working to hard"" engine smell even on low settings :(but .... it hasnt broken yet..."
2,Need improvement,"This is the second mixer I bought from this company, I though the last one was too small than I bought this larger one. The problem is not the power is the design. Their engineer should let their wife to try out at home first instaead just developming/testing at the lab."
1,Seller: Please contact me.,I bought this mixer almost exactly 10 months ago and have used it less than a dozen times. I was kneading bread dough and it just quit woking and started smoking. I turned it off immediately and unplugged it. It's completely fried and won't turn back on. Please contact me and let me know how to get a replacement. Thank you.
1,It came wrong!! doesn't work and i live abroad!!,i buoght it from amazon thinking that it was a waranty. nop. it came out to be bad. and now i dont know what to do
1,Not Meant to Knead Bread,"Like others have said, this machine is great if you want to mix softer doughs, BUT THE MOTOR BURNS OUT EASILY. Mine died after kneading 1-lb. loaves once every 2 weeks for 8 months."
3,"Buy an extended warranty, you will need it!!","Got one three years ago, die within one year right before the warranty expired. Got replacement through the factory and nice customer service. The replacement died after 1 year 11 months. With it out of warranty, it will cause me $52 shipping(both way) and $49 - $165 to fix it (and of course they told me the price will toward to higher side. ) So overall, my suggestion to all who are interested to this product is to get an extended warranty (at least 3 yrs) when you made the purchase. Because you will need it."
1,Lemons or flimsy,"I purchased a Pro 600 mixer 3 years ago. Shortly after the 1 year warranty period the unit stopped mixing. Since I had called concerned about excessive noise, which the customer service rep indicated was ""normal"", they replaced it with a rebuilt unit. Now, 20 months later, the rebuilt unit is dead. The only help I get from customer service is a list of places to get it repaired.I have not abused the units (I make 3 loaves of bread a week). Either I had 2 lemons, or the top-of-the line KitchenAid model lacks durability."
2,Look for a different mixer,We purchased the professional model thinking it would stand up over time. We only use it to make bread and pizza dough. It cant even handle 4 cups of flour. After moderate use the gears broke. This model should be recalled!
2,Noisy 6 Qt Mixer,"We've had a Kitchen Aid Mixer for years and have been pleased with it's performance. However, when we decided to ""upgrade"" to the 6 QT mixer we have been disappointed with the loud noise of the machine. Our son is a pastry chef and works in a University Kitchen and he provided perspective, informing us it's as loud as some of the school's kitchen large institutional mixers. The 6 Qt.Kitchen Aid is in our kitchen at home and the sound truly detracts from our using it. Surprised at Kitchen Aid and disappointed with the product. Something's not right with this model."
1,don't make them like they used to,"I purchased this model as a replacement for my 25 year old kitchenaid. I am very disappointed, and will return it after the holidays. The first time I made bread using the new ""more powerful"" mixer, it overheated and shut off. I have made the same recipe many times in my old model, and never had a problem. Very disappointed. I also found it much noisier than my old one. I think I will try a Viking next."
2,Great for light duty,"The power of this mixer is great, but not worth the money if you want to use it a lot! We bake a lot of bread, gingerbread, etc., and I have gone through two of these in three years. (The company replaced it once when it went out after just one year.) The gears strip. We have never exceeded manufacturer's recommendations for amounts of flour. I started looking on the internet, and found that my experience is not uncommon for those who use the mixer a lot for bread, etc. I am looking at a Cuisinart to replace my KitchenAid, and I have used KitchenAid for thirty years! I am sad, but the quality seems to have changed, and I don't want to waste any more money."
3,Do you really need a 6 quart mixer?,"You think I would learn after sending back two of these beasts because they quit running within the first week of ownership while mixing a smiple bread recipe; I ordered this one again for the third time hoping the new machine wouldn't sound like a deisel truck. I wanted a mixer with the larger capacity and I can live with the noise if it performs without suddingly stopping as the first two did. Unfortunately the steel gears are very noisy compared to the 4 1/2 quart mixer I've used for twenty years and you would think KitchenAid would address this grinding noise within their booklet. Another thing I dislike about the 6 quart mixer is the inability to tilt the motor head to access your beaters and product within the bowl. If this one quits as the other two did, I will surely order a 5 quart mixer with a tilting motor head next time."
4,"Good Brand, Pricey but worth it.",I owned the smaller KitchenAid mixer before and it was good. This KitchenAid 600 is great. I have two teenage daughters that love to bake large batches of cookies for school events. I use it to mix my Masa for Tamales and it handles the load easily. The sausage attachment is great for making homemade chorizo sausages or brat style sausages. This mixer is a bit pricey but now I have a great mixer to leave to each of my daughters.
5,Terrific Mixer !!!!,"This is my second KitchenAid stand mixer. I decided to upgrade from the Artisan. Very powerful, does an excellent job, and looks great in the Nickel Pearl color. Just one complaint, it's about 1 inch too tall to slide under my cabinet, so it does take up more room then I would like. Make sure you measure carefully before ordering. Once again Amazon.com did a terrific job handling this order and shipping my mixer to me quickly"
3,It is good with some exceptions,"I am all for the KitchenAid Mixers but this one seems a little problematic. One, you have to hand wash everything and if you leave anything in water for only a few min the metal starts to fade. Two, the attachments are kind of lose, I don't know if that is what is needed for a larger mixer but the mixing utensil comes off so easily that is tends to fall in to what I am mixing. Three, I don't know if anyone else is having the same problem but no matter how I adjust the mixer height the mixing utensils scrape the bottom. Maybe I need to call KitchenAid but I don't see this working as well as the last one I had."
4,If you want something pretty this is not for you....,"I am a professional pastry chef and recently purchased the pro 600 series. We use two of them in the kitchen every day. These mixers are durable and can stand hours of use each day, they usually last around three years with heavy usage. I was very disappointed when I opened the box; I thought I would be receiving a gorgeous red mixer. What I got was a red mixer but the paint was orange peeled and very flawed. Also there was the distinct faint sound of gears grinding. So far it works like a champ I have had it two weeks. I will not be purchasing another mixer from Amazon ever. I have never seen a kitchen-aid with bad paint like this one. In my profession appearance of the mixer doesn't matter so I won't be sending it back. My rating for the functions of the mixer is a 5 but the appearance rating would be a 2, if that."
5,LOVE IT!!!! NO MOTOR PROBLEMS!,I have had this mixer for a few monthes now. I love it!!! I make angel food cake in no time and have made bread alot of times. I think as long as you know that the things that are harder to mix like bread you need to set the machine at a lower speed. I always use the book included as a guide for what speed to use for recipes. Plus it makes my sister super jealous! Ohh and not to brag but I got it for under $200 because of a mega sale on amazon and $64 in rebates from the company! Winning :)
5,Kitchen Aid stands behind what they sell.,"I ordered my first mixer... it was shiney, and I was excited to use it. The first time I used the mixer it FELL APART!!! Literally, the screws fell out of the bottom and the head of the mixer fell forward in the mixing bowl!!! I was sick about it, and called the Kitchen Aid number that is right on the mixer. I told them what happened... they sent me out a new mixer immediately! They even paid for the pick up of the broken mixer. Although, I was upset... they really did stand behind their mixer and were VERY nice about. Now... I LOVE THIS MIXER."
5,Robin,"This review is specially for people out of Europe!A couple of months ago i decided to buy a US kitchenaid and import it to the Netherlands. The problem a lot of people think they will have is the Voltage and Hertz problem. Before i bought the item i did a lot of research on the internet to see if a 110V 60Hz product will work on a 220-240V 50Hz electricity network. I found out you need a good 110V to 220-240V converter and the 60 -> 50Hz doesnt matter. So i decided to buy the Kitchenaid and i bought a transformer at Amazon as well.Guess what, the Kitchenaid is working perfect! I never had any hickups the sound it makes is normal. This Kitchenaid is heavier than the Kitchenaids in the Netherlands and about 25% the price!The only thing i recommand you to do is, buy a transformer thats overpowered. Take about a 1000 Watt 110 to 220-240 Volt converter!"
4,KitchenAide Pro 600 Mixer,"used this mixer one time and really liked it's performance. When I went to use it again, it would not even turn on!!!!! So I called their 800 number. They are sending me a new mixer to replace the broken one with instructions on how to return the broken one(return costs are paid by KitchenAide). I hope I have better luck with the replacement."
5,Totally worth it!,"Although Amazon.com had the best prices for KithcenAid mixers, they are still expensive. Knowing that my girlfriend would be using hers regularly, I was pleased to read so many reviews on consumers having little to no issues with the longevity of their purchases. So far the mixer has been a HUGE help in the kitchen (and one hell of a relief on my forearms!). If you're thinking about purchasing one and are worried about the price point, rest easy knowing that the Kithcen-Aid brand mixers are totally worth it."
1,Expensive Junk,"Broke the third time I used it. KitchenAid repaired it under warranty. 2 years later all the gears stripped, it's going to cost me 100 dollars to repair it. No warranty. Really Kitchen Aide?"
2,Worked less than two years,"Worked pretty well for less than two years and that is a LOT of money to spend for a mixer than does NOT last and I only used this MAYBE once a week...probably more like twice a month. I never abused it or put more ingredients than it could handle (per the user guide). Even so, the unit would get HOT after only a couple minutes of kneading! Loved my first KA 4 1/2 QT stand mixer, but this one is a joke. Does not mix as well and does not get to bottom or sides of bowl very well at all. Also very awkward when you must stir to get to the bottom and sides with spatula or spoon while bowl is still attached. Cannot believe I'm left to shop for yet another mixer at my biggest cookie baking time of the year. will NOT buy another kitchenaid mixer. These days they are JUNK. Most definitely not worth $400!"
1,Metal gears completely stripped after 6 months of light use,"Bought this in Oct/Nov 2011. My wife has used it for relatively light tasks. About April it totally stopped working. Turns out, the gears are completely stripped. These are the supposedly new, metal gears. She has an old model from 10 years ago that is still trucking. But this one died after 6 months. So sad."
4,"Heavy-Duty, but noisy",noisy. bowl welds (as on all kitchen aid mixer models) not built to last - took bowl to metal shop and made more tac welds to strengthen.
3,"KitchenAid KP26M1XLC Professional 600 Series 6-Quart Stand Mixer, Licorice","I enjoy the better motor on this mixer from my last, but you can't tilt the head back, so this is highly inconveniant when mixing!!!!!!!I love the bigger bowl size, but not being able to adjust the head and stir easily is driving me nuts.I also need to learn to use the attachment set I bought with it yet.Wish I could combine some features of my old and new!!!!"
1,Do not buy...,"Unless you just need a mixer to decorate your kitchen. If you ever try to use this one, especially for bread, it will break fast. I did worn five of them, all between 14 to 17 months after their first use. Of course warranty was out each time, and when I learned about all the problems people had with this expensive mixer, I was shocked. This mixer is not intend to any dought work. Parts inside are poor quality and worn out really fast. Performances are in the lower range. Sounds like cheap ""made in china"" mixer. Customer service is horrible, since they are used to deal with so many unsatisfied people."
5,Great mixer,"My wife loves it so far, seems to be a great mixer. Has the steel plate instead of the plastic one."
2,Not as good as my old one,"I have owned a Kitchenaid Proline stand mixer since the mid 1990's. It has been a great mixer. I decided to upgrade to the larger 6qt Professional model. I used it briefly two times and returned it to the store. I didn't feel like the wire whip was close enough to the bowl to get all the ingredients mixed/whipped together. I did read the instructions about the adjusting screw but could not tell that the whip even moved. Also was disappointed that they had cheapened the attachments (my old whip is stainless steel, new one was aluminum) I am keeping my 90's mixer. Seems like everything made now is more expensive and NOT made to last."
1,Garbage,I used the speeds for the dough hook as specified and it still burned the motor out. I'm not sure where I want to go from here but I don't think I'll take anymore chances with this lousy machine.
5,Excellent Kitchen Equipment,"I debated getting the professional series or the smaller 5 quart mixer. I'm glad I choose the larger version. The side pins keep the bowl locked into place allowing the blades to scrape the sides of the bowl without moving. I have use the mixer for a variety of task with the outcomes spectacular. Recently make sour cream mashed potatoes, everyone said they were the best ever!"
4,I hope they issue a replacement for the beaters.,"I can't believe Kitchen AId puts out a mixer with beaters that can't be washed in the dishwasher! The sticker in the box says the wire whip can't be washed in the dishwasher, but the big, used all the time, beater was rough and discolored after one trip in the dishwasher when I washed it before using it. I hope they issue a replacement. But I do wish I had had this much power years ago, it mixes up big batches of cookies or bread dough so much faster than the Artisan I've had for 15 years and probably hastened it's demise by making big batches. It was still usable, but making ominous noises. If you only make small batches of dough, or mashed potatoes you may not need this larger size but I love it. The hand washed beaters are the only thing keeping me from a 5 star review,"
4,mixer review,"I received this as a birthday present - what a wonderful gift!The color is fabulous - not a bright red as I was fearful, it blends well with my kitchen.The only thing I was upset about is that the guard for the bowl was not included - since a guard was included on the previous version I receieved 10 years ago, I expected it."
5,Quality!,I bought this for my sister as a wedding gift and she LOVES it!! She does a lot of baking and cooking and it has most definitely come in handy for her. My mom has also got one which she has had for over twenty years now and it still works perfectly. Lasts a lifetime!
5,kitchenaidkp26m1xnp mixer,"i like this kitchenaid mixer it heip me a lot bake wery quick and is easy to wash .i will recomend this to friend ,every woman should hawe it at kitchen"
5,Love this KitchenAid!,"This is my first KitchenAid mixer. I love, love, love it! I've made several kinds of bread and I've lost count of the cookies. Only disadvantage is that we're eating way to many goodies! Ok we can curb that, maybe! I'm looking forward to trying different recipes and getting some attachments. All that aside I'm very pleased with the power and capacity of the 6 quart, my thought was this is going to be with me for years to come I might as well get one that will handle anything I want to do. I also got the Pearl Metallic. I thought it might be to shiny, but it's a beautiful gray color."
1,"Wouldn't know, the vender (Bazingaroo) sent me the wrong one! USED","Plain and simple, don't purchase from Bazingaroo. They sent me an older model. Not only that, what I purchased was a NEW KitchenAid mixer, yet they sent me a used one. In addition, it had someone's name scrawled all over it. They offered to let me keep it while also giving me a $100 credit. This would have been fine... except for the fact that the older, USED model they sent me isn't worth what I paid for for the UN-used NEWER model which is over $300 more than what they sent me, even if they threw in the $100! Please, for your sanity, and the comfort of not having to go through what I went through, don't buy from these guys."
5,Mom loves it,Bought this as a Xmas present for Mom. She loves it. I think she must use it at least once a week. The 6 quart capacity is larger than the one she had before so she can make a full batch of things now.
5,Hated for it to end.,"I had cared little about Sigmund Freud, and even less about reading a thick book about him, but I was captivated by the title. Stone has great titles and I have read Lust of Life, and found it rather interesting. When I read Passions of the Mind, it took a while. This was years ago, but I have not forgotten how much I enjoyed it. When I finished it, it was with some sadness that I folded it pages together, and laid it down to rest. It was used when I got it. It is beat up and weary, but I loved it, and have a much different feeling, not only about Freud, but also about the students of medicine and the times about which it was written. These were real people, and I like real people. I would put this book much higher on an approval list than The Agony and the Ecstacy, which I never quite finished. Maurice Thorne"
4,Excellent buy for this type of product,"These knifes are excellent value. They are razor sharp when received and stay that way with a few strokes of a sharpner, after or before each use. The ony thing is these knifes are not drop forged, they are stamped steel, but are of excellent quility. One last thing do not put these knifes in the dishwasher it will damage the handles and the blades. Hand wash them only. I would recommend these knifes to anyone on a budget as a very good product for a very reasonable price."
3,poor customer service from vendor,"The video disc I purchased from Palacio Musical has bee released under 2 titles. Since I own one already, I requested an exchange or credit from the vendor. In reply I received a rude response indicating my ""ignorance"".I wish to pursue this no further, so I'll keep the product to give as a gift. Nevertheless, I am greatly disappointed in Palacio Musical's treatment of customers."
4,"Red Land, Black Land: Daily Life in Ancient Egypt","Loved it. This book is actually a textbook, but it's the most interesting textbook I've ever read. It really gives you a ""feel"" for daily life in ancient Egypt."
4,"RedLand,Black Land","Funny and informative - adds a lot to the Amelia Peabody novels that she wrote which were placed in the Egypt of the 19th-early 20th century, also to the various TV presentations of 20/21 century archeologic discoveries. Helps a lot that she revised the book, which one can see fairly easily.Linda Sheean"
5,A classic,"An excellent overview of daily life in Egypt by a veteran Egyptologist who, disappointingly, only wrote a few books on Egypt, and a ton of mysteries under a pseudonym, a major loss for Egypt lovers."
3,History of everyday life in ancient Egypt by Eliz. Peters (pseud.),"This is a basic history of Egypt, of the life of the average people, written by B. Mertz PH.D, otherwise known as Elizabeth Peters, author of the Amelia Peabody series. It is referenced in many of the non-fiction books I have read or skimmed. Unfortunately, not too many photographs and they are black and white. The writing is clear, not dry and boring or text-bookish although it was originally a textbook I believe. It is readable, and fun to ""dip into"" for selections on various aspects of life, such as clothes over time, army life, etc."
5,"Red Land, Black Land","I love all things Barbara Mertz. She injects humor in her writing and her books are always entertaining and informative. I have a fascination with ancient Egypt and have read many, many books on the subject, but I always learn new things from Barbara's books. I'd certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn and laugh at the same time."
1,Good luck getting an intact one!,"This may be a great pot when it's in good shape, but your chances of getting an undented one are close to zero. the first pot I got had a dented lid, and it was clearly damaged in transit. The box they shipped it in was very thin, and they did not double-box it. The replacement (which arrived very quickly - thank you Amazon) WAS double-boxed, and the inner box was not damaged at all (the outer was a mess, though)but when I opened it, I saw a huge dent, so severe that quite a bit of enamel was chipped off both inside and outside of the bottom pot. (see photo)So even though I still want this pot and Amazon's price is good, I'll pay more and buy it locally, where I can at least see what I'm getting. Going back and forth to UPS is a very annoying waste of time. Too bad both Granite Ware and Amazon don't understand that this product is delicate and must be handled carefully."
1,Would not buy again!!!!,I just used this product for the first time on Friday and all it did was leak. I tried multiple times to tighten the faucet part and would not get a great seal. I'm past the return date so my plan is to throw it away since it pretty much useless.
1,Missing faucet,"I ordered this item and the faucet was missing. Unfortunately, I did not receive a total refund for the item. I believe they charged my account for the shipping and handling even though the item was missing parts and the return policy clearly says that you will not be charged in that case."
2,TOO SMALL!!,"Because this product was called ""Clam and Lobster Steamer"", I assumed it would be large enough to accommodate more than ONE clam and ONE lobster. Not so. I never would have selected this pot had I seen it in person. I returned the pot and bought one (from Amazon) twice as large for the same price."
2,Look elsewhere for excitement...,"My toddler son really loves the Truck and Motorcycle videos, which have a great deal of action and keep his interest all the way through. I thought he would surely enjoy ""There Goes a Boat"". Unfortunately, he lost interest almost immediately. So much of the video is spent either inside the boats (technical-type stuff, which went right over my son's head) or with Dave/Becky goofing around (which I found particularly excessive in this video). I think he would have preferred some speedboats or more ""out and about on the water"" scenes. Overall, a dull choice compared to others in the series, although older children may find the technical information interesting."
2,"Not nearly as good as the train, firetruck, or bulldozer.","This video wasn't nearly as good as the Firetruck, train, or bulldozer videos. Dave needs to stop trying to be so entertaining and be a little more informative."
5,Good overview of the actor's life and career,"With interviews from people that knew him, including his son, A&E has done a great job. A man that was far more gifted an actor than generally thought. Highly recommended"
5,Real rap,"Great flows, intense beats, and superlative lyrics. One of the best rappers around. Not gonna be a legend, but should not be forgotten."
5,Simply a good cd ...,"No frills .... It's simply a good cd, has some of Muddy's best stuff on here. If you new to Muddy and want to save some $$$ you can start with this cd. Once you hear a cd like this, you may end up buying more Muddy like I did."
5,Pardon my English...,"Got this Spanish language translation for my husband, who has been studying Spanish in Continuing Ed for several years. He loved it - not only did it challenge him linguistically just enough to keep him on his toes, he tells me the translation is flawless. We both reread the book at the same time - he in Spanish, me in English, discussing progress, details, story nuance, etc. as we went. His experience was the exact same as mine - and as both of us had already read the book (he, once, me, several times), we could be objective of his experience. Highly recommend this edition for anyone - Spanish or English native speakers/readers - you won't miss this seminal work in detail or nuance."
5,buy it if you're a seeker,"this and path notes are probably the most important and influential books i've read on the esoteric subjects of spirituality, meaning, self-exploration, enlightenment, kundalini, meditation, and the mysteries of life. If you seek you shall find; reading Glenn's books will take you one step closer."
2,ON HOLD!!!,I HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF ENJOYING WATT STAX FROM BOTH THE MOVIE AND LATER THE ALBUM AS A YOUNGSTER. I KNOW HOW GOOD IT WAS IN IT'S ORIGINAL FORM. UNFORTUNATELY I WAS BLINDSIDED BY THE CD DUE TO THE COMMENTATION OVERIDING THE MUSIC THAT SEEMED TO NEVER STOP IN LEGNTH OR IN FREQUENCY. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? THIS SHOULD HAVE COME WITH A FLASHING WARNING. DROVE A FIVE STAR PERFORMANCE DOWN TO TWO.
2,ALBERT KING FANS BEWARE!!!!!!,"If you are an Albert King fan buying this dvd for the ""complete"" version of ""I'll Play The Blues For You"", don't bother. Neither version here is even close to ""complete"". The ""bonus"" version is longer than the original, but it still doesn't even make it to the guitar solo:-( If you happen to have the ""Blues At Sunset"" cd I don't have to tell you that is the best part of the performance and it is NOT included here. Other than that, this film looks great and is a great historical document."
2,Wattstax,Dvd is good but not great.The movie is more political than music.Granted the live acts are great but the performances are short. If you want the music minus the politics I would suggest buying SOUL TO SOUL or Ike and Tina Turner review live from 1971.Both movies are more about the music and the performancesand both flics are rated 4 to 5 stars in my opinion.
3,nice vibes,"no subtitles available, too much talking in between, great concerts and very nice audio! Pity about the rubbish between de concerts......"
5,WHOA!,So glad this DVD exists. While I would have loved to see full performances--of course!--this is a fantastic time capsule of a pivotal era.
2,Meh,I guess I expected more music and less politics from this film about a music festival. The 70's era outfits the people had on were amazing though. And Rufus Thomas' and Albert King's parts were totally awesome.
1,Not a concert film,"75% of this is profane, racist ranting, briefly interrupted by some poorly edited concert footage. This is not what I thought I was buying. I would return it if I could."
3,Wattstax,"I was expecting more music. The producers would start to show performances and then cut them off right when it started to get good. It was more like a documentary about the attitudes of black people during the time Wattstax was made. It was very interesting, but it wasn't what I thought I was purchasing."
5,Absolutely superb!,"I purchased this dvd back in 2005, and i have to say it was one of the best concerts on dvd that i'd ever seen. I was just a little fella when this event took place, but Al Bell had a serious sound going on down there in Memphis. I've always been a big fan of Isaac Hayes, and to see him performing along with some of the other r&b greats on here was a tremendous treat. I only regret not being old enough back then to have caught this historical event in person. Not to mention, Richard Pryor was funny as heck too. I recommend for any real soul music listener to go out and cop this dvd. You won't regret it!"
1,REALLY LET DOWN,"I saw wattstaxx at the movies when it came out in the 70""s. It was awesome. This version is like going to a movie and having the people behind you talk through the whole thing. You cant tell if Richard Pryor is funny all you hear is punch lines. You cant get into how finky the bands are because the commentators turned the music down so they can talk. wish i could get my money back."
4,Didn't need to hear THAT MUCH from the Winos,"I'll keep this short: The performances in this DVD were extremely well done and moving. Richard Pryor's comedy was incredibly good, but those obviously drunk and/or high guys in many of the segments got waaay too much time in front of the camera. The quality of the entire film was lessened by the repeated appearances and inane utterances of people who were obviously drunk or under the influence of drugs."
4,the Black Woodstock,"Just as Woodstock captured the spirit of the White American youth of the 60's and 70's; Wattsstax does so with young Black America. I would've given it 5 stars if it were longer and didn't adruptly cut performances just as they're getting warmed up. The commentary is great. Recorded on the heels of Martin Luther King's [...], Wattsstax gives people who were either too young or not around at all an insight to the socio-political problems Black Americans faced back then. These were the days when all Americans questioned their government and took action; win or lose. Long before the days of ""get rich or die trying"". The organic music (real musicians NO samples, synths or drum machines) is so beautiful it's hypnotic."
4,"Wattstax- this IS old school, and it will take you to school.","A historical-cultural gem. If you weren't there you won't believe the vibe, the clothes, and the attitude unless you've seen this docu-concert. Not having been in the camcorder generation, I miss seeing so much of what went on around us back then. Wattstax brings it back; my kids were amazed.Buy it,"
4,WATTSTAX 30TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EDITION,The DVD was good. I was disappointed that more footage of singing artists and their names were not used.
4,Beautiful crib,"My husband and I picked out this crib because of its beautiful design and the fact that it will turn into a toddler bed and later a full sized bed. I liked the solid back design in the store but did not think about the fact that a bumper would be hard to attach because of that. Also the end posts on the crib are so thick that the bumpers are even more difficult to tie on. Our crib also has a few problems with the finish but thankfully they are in spots that cannot be seen easily. But, all in all, I think this is a sturdy, beautiful crib that we are very glad that we bought."
1,THIS CRIB IS DANGEROUS! BEWARE!,Well I been having this cribs for ten months now and its about the third time that my daughter has gotten her legs stuck in between the bar the first time I figure ok it was a accident and she was 5months she was just learning how to stand so I blew it off! my daughter was 6 1/months and again she got it stuck and had some black and blues now today she 10 months and she got her leg stuck again and this time while trying to get it out she happens to get the other one stuck to in the matter of seconds which was not cool when your trying to prevent the baby from leaning back while she was crying and screaming... I know this crib is beautiful and... good reviews about the looks and all but looks wont save you from making a trips to the hospital because the childs leg is broken and in pain . please let me know if you anyone gets in touch with the company because I can't
2,PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASE!!,"Hands-down, this is indeed a BEAUTIFUL crib, very sturdy and good quality and all that, but it is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE for hanging items! I have tried yet again to hang something on the rails and they are just too wide, so this being the 3rd strike, I wanted other future parents to know. We wanted this crib (I wanted it) b/c it is lifelong, but for the next couple/several years, it will be miserable!! I can't fault the toy companies, b/c the straps are pretty long, but almost NOTHING fits on the sides or front of this crib (we won't even mention the back), like mobiles, play light sleepers, etc. Your bumper won't tie on the back, either, and you had better make sure the bumper strings are at LEAST 6 INCHES or they won't tie on the corners. So, if you're sold solely by looks and plan on NEVER entertaining your child in his/her crib, this is yours! If not, good luck, and please post how you jerry-rigged it!!!"
3,Don't like the Solid Back,"I like this crib - but will buy a new crib if we have more children.Besides all of the posts that mention the problems with mobiles, bumpers and sheet savers... I found that the solid back was a problem for us in two other ways.First, my son hit his head several times on the solid back when he was trying to pull himself up/learning to sit up. If he fell forward or to the sides, the spindles didn't cause much pain. But when he fell back and whack his head... I think I felt it too.Also, once he was a little older, he would lay on his back on kick the solid back against the wall. After time, the crib back starting losing its strength.Not just a problem with this particular crib - but all solid back cribs."
4,Cute but long,"This is a really cute book about another world - Krystonia. The ""writer"" of the book tells of his journeys in the land of Krystonia, and introduces you to several new species and characters. Unfortunately, the first half of the book is just that - discussing the different animals in Krystonia - and is very long, drawn out, and sometimes downright boring. The actual action in the book - a wizard's attempted takeover - doesn't begin to happen until the later half of the book. The first time I read the book I almost couldn't make it through because the first half was so boring. But by the end of the book I really enjoyed the theme. So if you're looking for a book that draws you in in the beginning, this is not the book for you. But of you're willing to work through the boring part, there is a great treat in store for you."
5,Adorable,"I absolutely loved this book. I did find, however, that it was extremely difficult to read as a child, and only appreciated it fully upon re-reading as an adult. Consequently, I do not recommend for children under 13 years of age. The character development is fantastic, and you are brought into a new world of people, animals, and adventure. I highly recommend for someone looking for something different but fun to read."
3,"Nice, but much darker than image on Amazon","The product came fairly quickly and in good condition. The image is exactly like that on Amazon; so if you like that pastoral image.... The one thing we did not like, however, is the product we received was much darker than the one shown on Amazon. We were expecting the bright image to brighten the room it's in; but it has the opposite effect. Also, it does not come with the bar across the top that holds the tapestry up; you'll need to buy that extra. That being said, it's very different from the other prints, photo's and things we have on our walls, making it a nice addition."
3,Interesting but Disjoint,"While initially excited by this book, within a few chapters I found it disappointing. First, while the books a whole is organized in a logical way, each chapter is a desultory journey over mounds of unrelated information--some that can be supported by scholarship and some that amounts to no more than folk tales. Second, this books suffers from the same problem a lot of books translated or written around the same time fall prey to: ecumenism. The introduction by Merton is a tip-off that more of the same is to come. Personally, I don't like translations or books on Zen that ""Westernize"" Chinese philosophy, and I think that Wu does this far too much. Thankfully, this trend seems to have reversed itself (see, e.g., Burton Watson's translations of the writings of Lin Chi)"
2,Not exactly what I thought...,"The book contains no real review material, only sample tests and questions. There is a section that breaks down the question type by subject, but you cannot use this book to learn material for the test. You can buy this item for the questions, but dont think that it can be your sole source for test prep."
2,Ermph,"I was encouraged to read this for El Salvador, but there was very littel useful info in there.If someone wants to read the diaryish notes of a combat reporter than maybe this would have been 3 stars, but that wasn't me."
2,Ryszard can do Much Better,"The Soccer Wars is a timeless diary( timeless in the sense that it lacks chronology, not timeless in the sense of transcendance) that bounces from Eastern Europe to West Africa, the Great Lakes region, Central America and through the west back to Poland. Kapuschinski is usually a more thourough analyst and offers insights along the journey.He suggests many times that this is the book ""he never got 'round to writing"". Unfortunately, the lack of flow, ideas and critical thought makes it a book he shouldn't have written."
5,A witness's account of the Cold War,"It is a striking book. Mr. Kapuscinski is a great writer and the narrative is simply wonderful.It is a great account of the cold war, as fought in Africa and Latin America."
3,Incoherent Mess,"Sorry, but this book is a major disappointment. I have enjoyed a lot of Kapuscinski's writing, but this book really misses the mark. Some of Kapuscinski's trade mark incredibly perceptive observations shine out here and there, but what is the coordinating thesis??? What are the salient conclusions Kapuscinksi makes after viewing so much revolution? We never get any clear eludication of the above, the book reads like a diary and diaries are often incoherent messes. The book can be enjoyed on the level of a diary, but it would have been much much better had Kapuscinski put together a (few) coordinating thesis for the book, and allowed the book to flow in a way that supports his thesis. Also many of the topics that Kapuscinski touches really deserve their own entire books."
1,Not Worth It,"Should have read the other reviews on this particular model from Delta. Check out the reviews for the ones that are different metals. The pump does not work. Drilled holes in my wall, pieced it together, filled it up with soap, and nada. I will be returning this."
1,Inferior Product,"Multiple problems: 1) 10 pumps will only yield 3 small drops of soap 2) the hardware/connection betweeen that connects the bottle to the wall is poorly designed, it comes loose very easily. 3) The brushed nickel finish looks cheap.Finally I took it down and bought a different product made by Ginger."
2,"looks good, I needed replacements and they were all broken!!!","I bought this and it was broken, it didn't stick it would not pump at all. The second one did the same thing. The company informed me that knew about the problem and that they had fixed it, I think not The THIRD one stopped pumping with in a day. Let them rework this product before you buy, don't let them waste your time too!!!"
1,Delta Victorian Wall-Mounted,Delta Victorian Wall-MountedPure Junk Don't Buy It...It don't work & Leaks all over..
1,Terrible product,"I purchased this item and within weeks the pump constantly got stuck after you pumped it. It had to be pulled back up so you could get it to pump again. This continued for a few more weeks and then it would not even pump out any soap. Shortly after that the nozzle fell off. I contacted Delta service as the dispenser was still covered by the warranty. They were very pleasant and nicely sent me a whole new dispenser. I put it up and wouldn't you know it, won't pump and it gets stuck after you try to pump it. I took the pump mechanism apart to see if I could figure out the problem. One of the steel ball valves was not seated properly so the pump couldn't create the proper pressure to expel the soap. Ok, no problem I re-seated the ball valve. Pushed it down and presto soap came out and then presto the pump won't come back up. Pure junk and from the sounds of it not an isolated incident. Don't waste your money and time with this."
1,Piece of junk,This is a piece of c****. I rarely bother to post reviews unless something is incredibly good or incredibly bad - this falls into the latter category. It's stopped working two months after I bought it. Now I have to try to get a replacement from Delta. I'll not be buying more products from Delta ever again.
3,"Nice Design, But Wear Easily","This is perhaps the third example of this dispenser we have had, over 10 years ~ We continue to purchase new ones, only because we like the design/style/finish, and the price allows for replacements. The pump will develop issues after a few years ~ The finish, especially on the top plunger will diminish and start to pit, no doubt from water, and repeated use. Looks good, works wells, but don't expect it to last forever."
1,disappointing,"I was so excited to get this product. Spent the time getting it set into the wall, and then the pump on the thing doesn't even work."
1,Attractive But pump fails,"I first purchased approx. three or fours years ago. The disp. goes with my faucet and towel bar,fits decor.BUT be prepared to replace entire unit yearly,as pump stops working and CANNOT be replaced without purchase of entire unit.Have thought of trashing entire unit but then will be left with attached holder on wall,with no use,or hole in wall.Delta needs to come up with a solution,as cleaning pump does not help...should sell with a couple of replacement pumps.... Gets to be costly to replace entire unit just to have a working on the wall disp."
4,A Pleasing Book,I looved this book. I do some of the exercises in the morning before I do my Makeup and go to school. My body has also gotten in much better shape ever senice I started doing the exercises regulara (my mile time has improved too). I recomened this book to any one!
2,More appropriate for younger children,"As a yoga teacher and a mother of teens I am seeking books that present the beauty and value of yoga to teens. This book is nice to look at however...if you are seeking a yoga program that teaches classic yoga postures this is not the book for you. They are only briefly mentioned late in the book. My kids and the teens that I teach do not want postures with ""kid names"", they are interested in and are capable of learning the true names of postures and the metaphors that they present. Alignment in postures is not presented well and while I do not overly focus on strict alignment with teens I feel that it should be presented in a book on the subject. In my mind this is a ""fun"" type book but not for serious students or teachers."
4,Great Book,This book was so great. I'm a follower of the raw food diet and have practiced yoga for 2 years now. I'm only 16 but after I did some the exercises in this book I saw results after 6 weeks of doing them. I'm a surfer so being in shape is a must. This book worked for me. I also haven't had sickness in a year. I would recommend this book to anyone.
3,Two episodes,I was a little disappointed that this video only has two episodes. The other Dino Dan have several episodes on each.
3,too short,This video is very short. If it was longer I would give five star my son loves dino dan very much
5,DVD,"Once again, this is a good dvd for anyone whos kids love dinos. Dino Dan teaches them alo about dinos and my kids love it."
5,Great Sci Fi,"I was surprised this book does not have more reviews and a large entry on Wikipedia. The Humanoids deserves a wider audience, it compares favorably to 1984 and Brave New World and is entertaining and suspenseful to boot. It is truly great science fiction. It is depressing though, perhaps that accounts for its lack of popularity. The book is an important commentary on the nature of Freedom. Moreover, those who blieve in God but wonder why (s)he is not more overtly benevolent, would do well to read this book."
3,An old but still worthy warning flag.,"Forty or so years after The Humanoids was written, one might be excused for proclaiming its author as prescient. We Earthlings welcome them at first, for they do all the grotty little jobs we don't like to do; they help with almost obsequious servitude; they are there to protect and to serve - their motto, indeed, 'To serve and protect, and keep men from harm' might be the motto of the modern, omnipresent and omnicompetent government. And, like that government, they take away one freedom after another, until...well, you must read the book to find out. May our tale end as happily."
5,Perfect,"I ordered the complete Fiesta kit as my wifes Christmas and Birthday (28th of December) gifts. Big plates, little plates, bowls (I see now I will have to order the larger bowls), canisters, sugar and creamer, gravy bowl, glasses (three different styles) etc and she loves them. Problem is what to do with the old stuff...amazing how much you accumulate over time. Long story short the Fiesta line of products are first class as are the retailers Amazon.com works with. I requested gift wrapping which most vendors offered and they arrived with no problems, except the salt and pepper shaker of which one of them arrived cracked but was cheerfully replaced. Can't say enough good about my experience."
5,YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK,This book was wonderfully delightful. Heather Graham gives you an insight of the American Revolution through her characters. I definately recommend this book!
5,Another Great Dave Douglas CD!,"The prolific Douglas scores again with this, his third recording with his string group. Douglas is a master of utilizing unusual combinations of instruments. The string group is comprised of Trumpet, Violin, Cello, Bass and Drums. (His Tiny Bell Trio consist of Trumpet, Guitar and Drums) While the group does tackle a classical piece, a Messian composition originally for organ, there is no mistaking this for anything but jazz. Though I prefer ""Five"" this is still amust have cd."
4,Final string quartet disc,"Dave Douglas put out three discs with his string group of Mark Feldman on violin, Erik Friedlander on cello, Drew Gress on bass, and Michael Sarin on drums. ""Convergence"" is the final one. Some people say this is the best of the three, but I am partial to ""Five"". ""Convergence"" has the same great combination of jazz with improvising strings and interesting songs. There is a lag in the middle of the disc, though. ""Joe's Auto Glass"" gets your attention in the beginning, and ""Meeting At Infinity"" is a good long song. The disc then meanders some, and I don't quite get the ""Borders Stories"" songs. ""Collatoral Damages"" starts to bring things around, then ""Goodbye Tony"" and a traditional jazz-sounding ""Nothing Like You"" close the disc as strongly as it started. This is a strong CD, and Dave Douglas fans should get it."
5,Good DVD,One of the better DVDs my kid likes to watch over and over again. This one has a variety of live performances and skits.
5,Documentary,Santa got this for my 4 year old. Love the little skits n flashing from concert to other stuff. The documentary at the end was very good. I don't care if u make fun of the wiggles but these guys worked very hard to get where they r now. Three out 4 kids adore the wiggles growing up so I applaud them. Bands come n go but the wiggles have been around for 20 plus years!
2,Wrong Quantity,"These bags work as they should, however they advertise that it comes with 3 bags. I only got 2 bags. Not happy about getting jipped on 1/3 of what I paid for. Will be going elsewhere when I need more replacements."
4,What can I say,They're vac bags. What can I say. they keep the stuff I vacuum up from exiting the vac until I decide it's time
4,It's not waterproof,"Bought this to put on my RV, but then found out that it was not waterproof. Now I have to figure out how to keep it dry when it is wet outside as the placement does not protect it from the rain."
2,mediocre at best,"I purchased two Audio Vox doorbells to replace my old one, same model. One was purchased at OSH and didn't work even after I replaced the batteries, the one that I ordered through Amazon worked but only after I replaced the battereis that were included.This cost me an additional $6.00 and extra hassle and irritation all the fault of the manufacturer not the vendor.Be wary."
4,Captivating album,"In a world of hit songs and singles, this album is a delectable, soothing mix of songs that you can play from start to finish - no skipping. Sia's tone is extremely unique and beautiful - it's slightly nasal, but extremely powerful and her ability to slide from note to note is remniscent of the skatting ability of Fitzgerald - though Sia takes a much slower approach. ""breathe me"" is ethereal and absolutely breath-taking - one of those times when the single actually is the best track on the album. ""Don't bring me Down"" and ""Sunday"" are great tracks as well. The only let down of this album is the lack of variance in tempos - it's a little slow at times, but other than that it's a great CD and I'm proud to have it on my wall. If you fancy Sia and other female singer/song writers, try ""Siren Songs"" by Gretchen Lieberum - an irresistably sultry, sexy female subpop/jazz vocalist whose latest album features innovative musical and lyrical ideas."
3,how can i say...,"Colour the small one is relaxing,somehow melancholic album, with a great vocal,over avarage melodies,high quaility sounds and some really moving tracks like ""breathe me"" and my personal favourite;""the church of what's happening now"" (a simple but great line gets into your head:throw away yesterday,today is a brand new day"")if you buy this album it'll probably catch you in track 3 and will make you have a good time until the end with its catching and relaxing melodies.They'll make you smile or sometimes feel sad,but never bad.once you listen it all,you'll eventually come back for more.So if what you are looking for is good,high quality music,you are in the right title , but dont keep your expectations high like finding a track to make you cry for hours or change the way you look at your life;which;i thing should be the purpose of music."
4,Simple,"It's a great chill, bbq, sunday afternoon cd... The remixes of a couple of songs are super dope."
5,What a voice!,"I just saw Sia last night live in concert in San Diego. I was blown away by her voice. The recordings with Zero 7 and this album just don't even come close to doing her voice justice. She just blew the roof off. She doesn't need a mike. Her voice could fill a concert hall. Some of the reviewers below compare her to Tori Amos, etc. If they could only hear Sia live, they'd really know how original and distinct her voice is. I can honestly say I've never heard anyone sing with such power and raw emotion. Kind of like a Brenda Lee belt with a Billy Holiday vulnerability. My advice: play it loud because she sings live with such power. It's the closest thing to hearing her live."
5,Sia Nails It,"I love this album! I first heard Sia with Zero 7 and loved her voice. I bought her album, Colour the Small One. I gotta admit, after the first casual listen I was unimpressed, but put it in my car and listened to it some more and I really enjoy it. She has such a big, lovely voice and a lot of heart. Some of her songs are a bit sad, but beautiful and so relaxing. This is a wonderful wonderful Cd."
3,Pleasing and Pleasant,"If you are a fan of Gray's Anatomy or your favorite radio station has a female name, you will find that your day in your cube will be that much more bearable with the wistful tones of Sia on your ipod.Somewhere between Tori Amos and The Sneaker Pimps, any fan of Dido or Ivy, will instantly connect with the accessibly lush sounds of Sia."
3,Good but a little dissappointing,"This is a solid album but after hearing the single I was expecting better. It's still great chillout music, very calm nice downtempo stuff that makes great background music. Definitely better than Zero 7's last album, which was awful, although it's not as good as the first Zero 7 album, which was awesome. Overall, Sia has a nice voice, but could use a little more passion and creativity to put her over the top from just good to great. Until then, she'll always be remembered as the girl from that Zero 7 song Distraction, and not as Sia, the solo artist.Also, if you like the single Breathe Me, search out the Four Tet remix, which may even be better than the original.And I don't watch Six Feet Under."
2,Disappointing,"Much as I tried to like this cd, there are really only about 2 or 3 songs that are worthy in my opinion. I was turned on to this one because I heard ""Breathe Me"" on the finale of ""Six Feet Under"". Coupled with the exiting montage it was an excellent choice and I do like the song by itself, but the rest of this album just isn't as interesting. The repetitive lyrics make it downright irritating to listen to, and if you're gonna repeat the same line 16 times you really better be able to sing the heck out of it. Sia just doesn't pull of the gospelly thing; she exudes a forced soulfulness. The album is just a little too drowsy for my tastes as well. I expected more of a sonic treat, with cooler samples and more ambience than brood, but it instead fell a little flat. At this import price too, it's hard to justify."
3,1 good song,"The entire CD is average, the only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of 1 amazing song. Breathe me. That song alone made it worth the buy though. Great song, on a sub-par CD."
1,Not so good without Zero 7,"I hear this album in FYE and a few songs on her myspace, and was disappointed. i was expecting a zero 7 with a little twist, but only got her voice. her voice is, without a doubt, one of the most amazing voices ever. its melodic and smooth like audio coffee...or audio hot chocolate. but her voice is best complimented by Zero 7's music. i'm still confused as to why they haven't joined forces. they're like peas and carrots(u know this, if u've heard any of zero 7's albums) and this album is like peas and...brussel sprouts. its like...huh? with the wrong music, her voice gets annoying-fast."
2,Not Impressed,I expected more from such a soulful vocalist. This album does her no justice. The music is poppy and the vocals are sometimes too soft and muffled to the point where it sounds like she is not even opening her mouth. It gets annoyingly whiney at certain points. I was not pleased at all. I hope she picks it up a bit next time. Her stuff with Zero-7 was much more enjoyable and emphasized the potential in her vocal style.
4,Wow is right,"I will probably regret not giving this cd 5 stars. This is an intriguing cd. ""Rewrite"" starts off, an incredibly engaging song, with a smoldering yet hopeful ""happy chorus,"" as one critic has described it. It has a laughing through tears quality, you don't know if she's just met a new love, walking out on the old one, or if the song is about the creative process, with literal ""rewrites,"" and the lyrics are somewhat cryptic. Other highlights are ""The Bully,"" ""Moon,"" ""Sunday."" I don't know who to compare her to; totally original, incorporeal, melodic Euro-pop (although she is from Australia), but fans of Tori Amos and Charlotte Martin should like."
4,New mold of songwriting,"I'm docking a star for 2 tracks where Sia tries to sing like Nelly Furtado. Otherwise, a pretty great album for the following tracks at the very least:RewriteSundayBreathe Me(wow)The BullyDon't Bring Me DownWhat some people are missing about Sia is that she doesn't belt out the showtunes like Barbara Streisand, and that was NEVER the point! Sia follows directly in the line of intense, moody confessional singer-songwriters like Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan. IT's about baring her soul to the audience, and she definitely does it here to great effect.Also to a previous reviewer who said that Sia ripped off Tori Amos in ""Breate Me"", well that's some neat trick to be able to sing write and sing like that, no? Besides, Tori never wrote such straightforward lyrics, the Queen of Obtuseness."
4,Pretty good!,"These lashes are great! They don't look too gaudy or fake. The only downside is that they don't last 3 weeks. Maybe 2 to 3 wears and they're done because the glue doesn't come off of them, even with the remover."
3,not as good as i would have hoped,"This is the first time that I have bought false eyelashes, they are ok. obviously you get what u pay for. The eyelashes were not cut properly I had to cut and make even."
5,LOVE these!,"I can't wear mascara because it leaves dark circles under my eyes (no matter what brand I try...), so I decided to try these fake lashes for a friend's wedding. I love them! They look very natural, not too long, not to think or dense, they just give your eyes that extra ""omph"". I like that they're made from real hair as well.Applying them can be tricky at first. You'll probably have to trim them a little. Then I apply a generous amount of glue at my lash line, then on the strip of the fake lashes. I wait about 30 seconds to let the glue get tacky, then I slide them on and tap them into place. I cover any gaps between my real lashes and the fake ones with eyeliner (you could also apply the liner first). It takes a little practice, but once you have it down, it's second nature.Definetely recommend!"
5,So Divalishes,I love these lashes. No store by my home carry these lashes. They look so real and are easy to apply.
2,a little too thin,this one was too short and I could barely see it on my eyes. I'm not a big fan. the ware is okay
4,good but light,"Great light reading for late at night. Some good gems, examples; ""I knew by 10 years old that life would be happier if only I were quite stupid and devoutly religious.."" or, ""Happy work is as gratifying as sex or hard laughter or love or good drugs."" Or about boys, ""I wonder if they will grow up to be adult males who are led by their penises and wallets, or if, at thirty, they will visit sad friends."" And, ""Your looks start to go about the time you start growing up, about the time things are starting to gel.."""
2,DOESN'T RING TRUE,"Maybe it's too much to expect that every Annie Lamott book be great - but this one's a real disappointment. Annie tries to handle the impossible: the life-threatening illness of a beloved father who'd never had any medical problems prior to diagnosis within an addictive family - but the storyline wanders, the characters get fuzzy and in the end we're left with treacly soap-opera garbage that doesn't ring true. Her other books have MUCH more to offer, fortunately."
2,Book arrived in bad shape,The first 2 pages of the story were missing and a clump of more pages fell out when I first opened the book. Does not use recyclable packaging.
5,love the brutal honesty,"How could anyone not love this book (and the author)?!? Never have I read such a brutally honest account of ones life. Anne Lamott's writing is so refreshly sincere. All believers in Christ should rally around Ms. Lamott and encourage her to continue to bare her naked soul to the rest of the world. I read reviews that said she was irreverent, which if you read with a closed mind you may find this to be so, but I found her to be a REAL person, who realizes she is simply saved by God's grace and by nothing she's done on her on. I would encourage everyone to read this book, with and open mind and heart, and check your judgemental mind at the door. Keep it up Anne!"
1,Nothing to laugh about,"This story should be poignant, as it deals with the death of a loved one. Unfortunately, it is just annoying. I didn't chuckle once while reading it. The writing was lackluster and reminded me of ""Joe Jones,"" another of Lamott's early novels. Truly forgettable. Skip this turkey."
1,Seriously?,"I heard the author interviewed on NPR and thought I would try a couple of her books. She talks my style, but her writing is way to crude for me. I have standards, morals, and intelligence way above the characters and don't prefer to read books with gutter language. Never read past the first chapter, threw it in the trash."
2,Raw,"The Enchanter is clearly an exploratory piece of writing - it has a certain juvenile, rough feel that makes the reader certain that it is the beginning of an inquiry rather than the end. It would probably be most interesting to readers of 'Lolita' and 'Laughter in the Dark'."
5,Can't explain,"Though I have no Russian to make a forensic case of what I'm about to say, I have a hunch that Nabokov's Russian at the time of his writing THE ENCHANTER exceeded the mastery of English that Nabokov would later demonstrate with LOLITA et al.Even in English translation, THE ENCHANTER is more poetry than prose, a phenomenom not unlike Flaubert's MADAME BOVARY. Every sentence quivers with meaning, conveying a sinuous artistry that only the brevity of the piece seem to spoil and mar. Then again it may be the brevity of the piece that its perfection can't do without."
3,Sketchy predecessor to Lolita,"No one can write about ""The Enchanter"" without mentioning the fact that it is the precursor to ""Lolita"". Keeping in mind that this was a sketch for ""Lolita"", it isn't that bad. Who can say that they've written something brilliant without thought on the first try? Also, keep in mind that it was translated from Russian into English (not by Nabokov), so Nabokov's usual beauty in writing may be badly put into English. If you are interested in reading ""The Enchanter"", be it for the fact that you want to see where it meets with ""Lolita""."
3,Difficult graduate level textbook,"This is a difficult-to-understand textbook about educational research. However, one feature that is helpful is a multiple choice quiz at the end of each chapter which helps you to test your comprehension."
5,They Don't Make It Like This Anymore...,"They don't make rock'n'roll like this these days... I'm not saying I don't like nowadays music, but nobody can make it like Alice Cooper.This compilation is, in my opinion, a must-have for any music fan out there. It doesn't matter if you like rock, pop, rap or classical music; what matters is that this CD has 21 tracks of great music, something who seems to be unknown to most bands today.My favorite songs in here are ""Desperado"", ""Hey Stoopid"", ""I Never Cry"", ""I'm Eighteen"", ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"", ""Only Women Bleed"" and ""Teenage Lament '74"". These songs are just awesome, you must listen them to know what I'm saying.The message of this review is simple: buy this CD, it's awesome. I don't need to explain anything more, this is the Definitive Alice Cooper compilation and you should take it home."
4,Almost The Greatest Hits Of Early Alice,"This abum is not so much a greatest hits, as more a best of the early days. But then the last 2 tracks are from albums 10 years after the last.If it where my choice, i'd have not included Hey Stoopid and Poison, and instead have put in Go To Hell and Clones. Tho, it's hard to pick ""best of lists"" for Alice.... after 30 years of hits after hits, Alice should quit coming out with a million compilation and greatest hits type albusm every year and just release a box set with every album and call that ""the best of Alice"""
2,Another one!,"Another greatest hits, except this one is called Definitive Collection.They just keep spitting these greatest hits out and people keep buying the same songs, over and over again."
4,A Decent Collection that really gives you more stuff!,"I really like what Rhino's been doing recently with their re-releases/adjustments of bands greatest hits packages. They just seem to be getting it right in most cases and for we fans who enjoy the essentials so to speak, these best of's are what we want and all we need. Black Sabbath's Sympton Of the Universe release was great and some of the ELP stuff been very good as well. So bring it on Rhino!Rhino seems to be giving us the listener, a well rounded choice of what we'd like to hear. These very nicely remastered classics are better than ever. Sound quality is very good and they seem to be focusing on the older material or shall I say the good stuff and staying away from the fluff.Yes it's yet another Hits package, but I really like this one as it gives you more of the older tunes that haven't been showing up on most of the Foreigner greatest hits compilations.It's just a good listen all around!"
3,Standard nineties Yes...,"What can I say? The Yes of this decade are a partial repudiation of the MTV-ethic 'Eighties Yes, but all through the 'Nineties, it's been clear that they don't want to return to their greatness of the 'Seventies for fear of being called ""dinosaur"". They never have dumped their trademark vocal harmonies (thank God), and some songs on this this album take a few interesting liberties with rhythm and time signatures, but what's with that last song ""The Solution""? It runs for about six-or-so minutes, but after the actual song ends, you get a bit over fifteen minutes of environmental night noises (crickets, breezes, etc.), interupted every so often by very brief vocal excerpts from some of the other numbers, so that track ends up clocking in at over 23 minutes. Fortunately, the song is listed on the insert as being only that six-and-change long, but come on already! I can't always remember to hit <stop> at that point every time I play the freakin' disc! Geeeez..."
2,What happend to Keys To Ascension ????,"I'm a very old fan of Yes ""Best Progressive"" Band. When I listened to Keys to Ascension I and II, I thought Yes was Being the One again. The two new musics Be the One and That, That is are great, the live version of Awaken was perfect. So I bought the Open Your Eyes without second thought and when I got home and listen to it, I was frustrated. It seams that Rick Wakeman is responsible for all of it. Why?? He is not there ..."
2,An unfortunate album...,"This album, while being very good compared to any other band, only gets two stars when compared to other Yes. Since the loss of Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman and/or Tony Kaye, Yes has struggled to stay fresh wihout losing their style of making great music... yet i think this album falls flat when compared to the albums Talk and Union."
1,1 Star is being VERY generous,"The diehard fan should make this their very last Yes purchase, and newbies should stay far, FAR away from this disc.You'd feel ripped off if you stole it. The opening cut, ""New State Of Mind"" has some stellar vocal harmonies and very Yes-like lyrics, but even this standout track lacks in many areas, subtle production being one area. The vocals are so stacked they wobble. It's cheesy 80's rock feel doesn't help.It obviously sounds like they tried to overproduce to compensate for a lack of strong material, and believe me you'll notice. Not even Duran Duran needed this much gloss.Overall their most bland and lifeless effort."
2,As weak as I originally thought,"I'll keep this brief. After reading the reviews of this cd here, and realizing that I hadn't listened to this disappointing release in a while, I went back and tried to give it another listen. I'm still really underwhelmed. Other than the first two tracks, on which Anderson/Howe make a serious contribution, the rest of the work is uninspired, tedious and not Yes-like at all. Given that this album was really a Squire/Sherwood collaboration, this isn't surprising; however, some of the material is just awful. ""Man in the Moon"" makes my skin crawl, and the seriously insipid lyrics of ""No way we can lose"" are just intolerable. Unfortunate, coming from my long-time favorite band..."
1,No Drama,"If you thought 1980's Drama was a Yes low-point, then you haven't heard Open Your Eyes. It features what could possibly be the worst song ever written, ""Wonderlove."" After listening to this I went scrambling for Drama to hear how good a bad Yes record can actually be. Even worse than Union. Who knew THAT was possible?"
4,"Not Rabin era, but not old Yes either. . .",This album is actually a nice blend of the different styles of music we have heard from Yes over the years. Possibly the most underrated album in their catalog.
2,Disappointing,"Listening to this CD is like eating fast food: bland and unappetizing. Open Your Eyes is commercial, and like any other commercial recording, it lacks any creative depth whatsoever. The sound quality is excellent, though, and very well mixed, which is the only reason I didn't give it just one star."
2,One song morphs into the next,"As a long-time fan who appreciates ""classical"" Yes and ""Rabined"" Yes, I was very underwhelmed by this release. Each piece sounds like the one just before it, especially on the vocals. Try listening for the melody on any song (except the title track, which does carry quite well)--the subtle complexities they're known for are missing.Yes' trademarks--and the reason most pieces are still relevant today--are songs that build, that drive emotion, that leave you wanting for more. It's not here. Let's hope that the next release bears more fruit and fewer pits."
1,Zero Stars - Big Waste of Time,"Yes at their best are a highly talented, innovative and inspirational ensemble. *None* of that is present here, not one iota.The sound of this album is distinctly AOR tinged, as have all their releases since '90125'. Unlike '90125', the pop-oriented song writing on this release is exceptionally poor, and sounds completely uninspired. If you want to listen to well written pop rock, you won't find it here (check out Dave Matthews Band, Sting or something else). If you want to listen to prog-rock, right band, wrong album!On one level, I felt this was like Yes' answer to Jethro Tull's 'Under Wraps', not in term of musical style, but in term of final effect on the listener!"
2,They should've taken the advice of the album title...,"...and realized that this album is basically a mess. Written and recorded primarily by Chris Squire and Billy Sherwood, Open Your Eyes shows a confused group haphazardly making an album in order to go on tour and hoping that the music finds an audience. I rarely criticize Yes albums too harshly but nearly three years since I first heard it, it's a challenge to listen to the whole thing all the way through. There are a few good songs (""Open Your Eyes"", ""Universal Garden"") and some good musical passages (bass line to ""Fortune Seller"") but there are more than a few out-and-out duds on this album. My two star review is being generous. An album for completists only or fans of 80's AOR."
3,OK,"This disk isn't exactly ""junk"" as someone described it below, but it isn't great either. There are some good songs here, but too many have an overly slick production."
1,A major mistake,"This album was an obvious attempt to get some radio airplay and it finds Yes playing some eighties-like commercial rock. It makes you wonder if these guys are even aware of what's commercial nowadays. This is a pointless collection of bad pop songs unworthy of the name Yes. You even wonder if Steve Howe is playing on this album. The songs were mostly written by bassist Chris Squire and new member Billy Sherwood, with Anderson adding his voice later on. A lifeless, overproduced mess, this is exactly the kind of stupid move that has characterized Yes since the late 80's. No wonder they've lost so many fans."
4,A fine cd with excelent songs by YES!!!!!,"This is one of Yes underrated cds not only because when it was released, it lacked good promotion and distribuition by the record company. It was a very hard to get cd by one great band.This cd is the first without TREVOR RABIN, but sounds as he is still there. This cd has a ""brother"" cd very similar in sound and songs to a solo cd by bassist Cris Squier and guitarr player and producer Billy Sherwood.This collection of songs by YES mix the sound the band had with TREVOR RABIN with the old sound as a so called progressive band.The best song is ""Open Your Eyes"", but also the rest of the cd stands out well. The only observation i have is that if you listen to it completely you somehow get lost even tho Bassist Cris Squire gets the chance to sing on a couple of songs. Other good songs are ""Fortune Teller"", ""Universal Garden"" and the bautiful ""Wonderlove"". This is a very satisfying cd. GET IT!"
2,At crossroads again...,"The first post-Rabin studio album,found Yes in a creative crisis of some sort,very much evident here.Gone are the fantastic interplay of the past,or even the harder edge of the eighties. There are far too few inspired moments,and too much confusion regarding the style,putting their music in a creative limbo."
1,Open Your Eyes...But Cover Your Ears,"This has to be the WORST Yes album to date. After Union and Talk I had lost faith in Yes being able to actually come with anything interesting anymore. But then Keys I and II came out and while the new studio material on Keys I was not that great, Keys II offered up the strongest Yes material since Big Generator and 90125.This album, however, does not follow in the footsteps of Keys 2 at all. Instead of songs with substance, we get songs without direction. I literally cannot recommend one good song on this album. The songs are simply awful.As much as I think Trevor Rabin began to swamp the Yes sound by the time Talk came out, I wouldn't mind having him back to restore a sense of power and melody back to the band."
3,A Clear Miss By Yes,"As someone who absolutely loves Yes, and loves almost their entire catalog of music, I was hoping reviews I'd read online were wrong. They were not! The songwriting on Open Your Eyes is just not up to the usual Yes standard, and the songs sound overproduced and lack emotion and impact.I'm not sure how we these guys can go from the awesome ABWH (not officially a Yes album but close enough) to the lackluster albums Union and Talk, then release the excellent new studio tracks on the Keys To Ascension albums, and then release Open Your Eyes! What followed it, The Ladder and Magnification, are both good albums (especially The Ladder -- it's excellent)."
1,A desperate cry for the return of Trevor Rabin and Tony Kaye,"When Yes released the Keys To Ascension cds, I thought the new material was okay. The live material definitely kicked ass. Now, with Tony or Rick nowhere to be found, Open your Eyes hits the stores and I thought it was a huge disappointment. Not because of a new keyboard player (I saw them on the VH-1 Hard Rock Cafe thing) because obviously, Igor is a great keyboard player, but Yes seem to be way past their prime. They need Trevor and either Tony or Rick back in the band. If you haven't heard this cd yet and you're a fan of albums like Talk, 90125, or Union, skip this one!"
2,"Open Your Eyes, Close Your Ears","I've been about as big a Yes fan as there has ever been. I don't know the member's middle names or birthdates but I have always appreciated their music. Open Your Eyes is not ""Yes"" music. It is Yes with the very talented Billie Sherwood. Anderson, Squire, Howe, Wakeman, Bruford and/or White is Yes. Ten and twenty minute compositions are Yes although the short pieces are great too. There was synergy there not created with other line-ups or during attemps at more mainstream rock oriented albums like Open. It's good, it can't help but be good with this talent but it isn't great, which is what I always hope for and usually get with Yes. If you like Union or Talk you will probably like this album. If you think Fragile, Tales and Close To The Edge were the best rock albums ever made you'll be very disappointed."
3,Not that good - but it gains with time!,"After the two amazing Keys To Ascension double CD's, it was really an anticlimax to put Open Your Eyes into the CD player.But honestly, this album gains a lot once you've listened to it about ten times. Just don't take it for more than it is. It's just Yes from the band's more simplistic and semi-commercial side. A rock album.One of the best tracks on Open Your Eyes is the ballad From The Balcony which touches the Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album's style. Another good ballad is the halfway symphonic Universal Garden which is close to Yes'ish.The catchy title song and the opener are quite good rock songs - they're just more simple than we Yes fans are used to from the band.Open Your Eyes closes off with a kind of sound collage. Different. But pretty good, in fact, once you get used to it."
2,Only for Die-Hard Fans,"I tend to agree that this is one of the worst Yes CDs...OPEN YOUR EYES contains a couple of good songs. The title song is excellent - it's got a good, driving sound. Also, ""Universal Garden"" is pretty good. Some of the songs are harmless enough - ""No Way We Can Loose"" and ""Wonderlove."" But some songs just drone on (like ""Fortune Seller"" and ""Love Shine""). Also, OPEN YOUR EYES contains one of the worst Yes songs ever - ""Man on the Moon."" ""I am the man in the moon and I hope to shine upon you very soon / Waiting in the night to bathe you all in moonlight / I am the man . . . in the man."" Yikes. Much of the writing is almost as trite.This CD isn't horrible. There just aren't any memorable songs. A couple years later, Yes made amends with THE LADDER. THE LADDER was hardly a return to ""classic-Yes"" as some claimed, but it was a more substantial effort."
2,Really no big deal.,"I think the trouble with this album is that is has no soul, something that never lacked in a YES album. Other problem is that the album has 74 minutes of radio-oriented songs! Silly thing to do!Also, Steve Howe's playing reached an all-time low here, he was obvioulsy not into the songs.Of coruse, when you're delaing with musicians of this magnitude, you can always find one, two or three great moments. That's all."
4,SOUNDS GREAT AFTER 12 BEERS,"REALLY STRONG GUITAR, POSITIVE CATCHY LYRICS, POWERFUL RHYTHM SECTION, I LOVE THIS CD. IT'S NOT THE TRIPPY YES OF THE EARLY 70'S, BUT ITS GREAT YES MUSIC."
4,A very underated album,"This is a great album, and one which is unfairly maligned by many Yes fans. This is very much a ""Chris Squire"" Yes album, and, of course, bears many similarities to Squire and Billy Sherwood's ""Conspiracy"" release. This may not be ""Topographic Oceans,"" but there is still a lot of musical complexity on this record, just not perhaps as obvious as Yes' '70's work, or even ""Keys."" ""Open Your Eyes,"" ""Universal Garden,"" ""New State of Mind,"" ""Love Shine,"" ""Fortune Seller"" are all great songs. There are a couple of relatively lackluster (for Yes) spots, but overall, this is a great, energetic, joyous, rockin' Yes record, fit to be placed alongside the rest of their output. This album may have some of the sound of the Rabin Yes, but in spirit it's much closer to their classic work. Don't prejudge this record - listen first."
1,Squire & Howe caught napping,"Except for two or three good tunes on this CD, ""Open Your Eyes"" disappointed me greatly. I feel it to be Yes' worst album since ""Tormato"". While Chris Squire penned some of the songs on this album, his classic punching bass is, for the most part, dormant, as it was on the CD ""Talk."" Steve Howe's guitar wizardry is ""missing"" as well. What's up with the CD's final cut, ""The Solution""? After the initial five-plus minutes, there are about 20 minutes of near silence. I'd rather have had more songs. This album does not possess the classic Yes sound. Yes' newest, ""The Ladder,"" returns to form."
1,A desperate cry for the return of Trevor Rabin and Tony Kaye,"Is this a joke, or what? Yes has been one of my favorite bands for a long time and I thought the Keys albums were great. How could they make such a sloppy cd, especially less than a year after Keys 2 came out. Do us a favor, and bring back Trevor and Tony."
5,The Magic of Olive Water,"What a pleasant surprise this product was! I expected it to feel like a toner on the skin, and not much else, but found it does much more.First, it gently cleanses (I used it on cotton balls), and leaves a nice, moisturized feel.The description on the bottle says it leaves a radiance to the skin, and I was skeptical about that claim, but the glow that comes after using it, well, it's radiance!The moisturizing results are good as well.I will say that if you wear very heavy makeup, you might need more than this to cleanse your face. But even then, I think it would make a nice ""second step"" in the cleansing process, one which will do more than an ordinary toner would."
4,worth it no complaints at all,"This monitor is definitely worth its value. using it for couple of months now, no complaints at all. Though i havent been using its speakers which are of ok quality."
4,Great Value,This monitor is a great value! The picture is vibrant and clear and it didn't empty my pocketbook. It is extremely user friendly as well. The only thing that I wish were a little better is the sound dynamic from the built in speakers. Although it is a space saver it would be nice if they carried the ability to have a little more bass. Unfortunately you have to take that from someone who went from having a subwoofer speaker system to just having the built in computer speakers. They are very normal computer speakers though and I am extremely happy with this purchase.
5,Awesome Surprise,"Okay, so after hearing some buzz over them, and checking out the blue van website (thebluevan.com), I took a chance and bought The Blue Van - The Art of Rolling. And I -SO- did not regret it. I was completely hooked with the raw vocals, pounding of the drums and the Hammond organ. They just jam it out with fun old-school R&B / Rock n' Roll. ""The Art Of Rolling"" will be getting heavy rotation this summer..You should definitely check it out."
1,I should have known better,"The cover photo fooled me. I should have realized that Timothy Schmit had not aged but the others had. I was looking for more of his work. Although he is pictured on the cover, I did not see him anywhere during the performance.The others may be talented performers, but the cover deception turned me off."
3,"interesting compilation,obfuscates the real point","of course, no one who listens to this collection thinks mr. abu-jamal is anything other then a victim of a racist society,unfarly sitting on death row.the list of supporters is most impressive,and mr. abu -jamal himself is rather understated in his tone.The salient point is not the gross differential between rich and poor in the court system[is this news to anyone that people of color are routinely treated poorly ?],nor the blatant racist policies of the death penalty. The point is that mr. abu-jamal shot a man in philadephia,and has no defense other then some well meaning folks taken in by a smooth talking con.Speaking with others who have been inside,we all to a man agree that he is playing folks,and doing a damn good job of it.Shoud he die, of course not. People should look at the facts,not the hype,read the court report,read the trial transcripts.No,they wont..."
5,it works!,"We purchased this to put in the closet that holds the kitty litter box. It is unbelievable how well this works. It gets rid of any smell, and also gets rid of the odor from the cat food which is usually more unplesent than the box. The big downside is that after two weeks, the filter did stop working, so it had to be replaced. The filter that comes in a three-pack for $7.99 works great, you don't need to buy the special pet ones which are more than 8 dollars each. So for $70 a year, you can have a fresh smelling kitty area. And the filters have free shipping and no tax. Get this, it works and the filters are worth it."
3,Works OK for the price,"I am on my second unit now. The first one lasted about two years running continuously before it died. I was pretty happy with it for use by the cat box. Cat litter dust does clog the filter pretty quickly, but I just vacuum the dust off occasionally. I am very disappointed with the second one though, it is much louder than the first one. Some of the reviewers compare the loudness to that of a computer fan. The 'whisper mode' on mine is much louder than any computer that I own. For this reason I am hoping that it breaks soon so I can try another brand. Although if Amazon still has them on sale for $12, I may just get another one and hope that it is quiet like the first one I had. It is worth taking the risk at that price."
1,Useless,"I am unable to use this product because none of the electrical sockets in my home has the strength to hold onto the electrical prongs of this relatively bulky appliance. This is definitely not one of those cute little plug-in heated-oil room deodorizers. This appliance weighs in at 1.5 pounds, and has dimensions of approximately 8.5 inches high x 6.5 inches wide x 3 inches deep. Think of it as a hefty box of brown sugar plugged into your wall with nothing holding it in place except the plug. Unless your socket forcefully grabs electrical prongs, you would be well advised to consider an air cleaner that is not plug-mounted. The weight of this unit literally pulls it out of the socket. I, for one, do not appreciate the additional expense and bother of replacing a wall outlet to accommodate an appliance that may or may not do what the manufacturer claims. This product is clearly a misadventure in engineering."
4,Good value for the price,"After reading all other reviews I thought that this product would work well and for only $20. I tested it while cooking a Mexican dish and it did better than expected. Clearly it did not get rid of all the garlic, onion and chili oddors, but it did reduced the smells a lot. I liked it a lot. In fact I will buy another one for the bathroom."
5,It does what it claims to do,"I use this product to get rid of the smoking odor in our living room. It works! If you hold a cigarette near it, you can see it sucking all the smoke. I also like the feature where the tiny light on top turns red to indicate that its time to change the filter. I have had this for almost 2 years now and its still going strong. Highly recommended!"
3,Not for a ferret owner,"I purchased this product hoping it would help cut through the smell of a ferret. It did nothing of the kind. While it has been working wonders in removing dust from the air, it does not hold up to its deodorizing claim. I have not tried it around a cat litter box, and maybe it works with milder odors, but the pungent musk of a ferret has already proved to be too much for it."
5,Excellent wireless card for compatible Macs,"I am using the AirPort card in an iBook, with an AirPort Base station in my home. This allows me to use my laptop inside and outside my home, up to about a 120-150 foot radius, for printing to my networked printer, connecting to other wired or wireless Macs, or connect to the internet (The AirPort Base Station, sold separately, acts as a Cable/DSL router, sharing the connection with up to 50 other networked Macs or PCs).PROs: Easily user-installed in PowerMac G4, PowerBook G4, iBooks, and newer iMacs, works without installing extra software or complicated configuration (hey--it's a Mac), 128-bit security, compatible with AOL.CONs; Range may slightly less than comparable 802.11b WiFi PC cards, especially in a Ti PowerBook."
4,"Happy Birthday, Duke! Volume 1","MUST You have this album? No. Would you enjoy it if you tried it? Absolutely! Many of our favorite Duke sidemen are included and you'll dig much more than Duke's standards. I'm not into the technical side of why Duke's music sounds the way it does. I listen to relax, groove, wonder at the genius, ability and creativity. It's all about entertainment and you will be entertained by this album."
5,Classic examination of the foot-soldier's war in Korea,"The thing that gets me about this book is that it appears that many of the problems Marshall points out from his on-the-spot interviews with Korean war troopers are EXACTLY the ones that had such a devastating impact on our Vietnam war soldiers. Individual trooper rotation among our forces while the enemy left veterans in place to familiarize themselves with the terrain. Casual attitudes to construction of U.S. fortifications and over-reliance of artillery support while the enemy maximized concealment and exploited it for movement and deployment. Reliance on unreliable native allies. Lack of communication about objectives. Insufficient manning of positions by understrength units. etc, etc... They say the military is always prepared for the LAST war, but typically the U.S. has always been prepared for the NEXT one."
3,A very informative novel that keeps one wanting more,"What made me choose this book? Firstly I wanted to read the book because my grandfather fought in one of the battles' right next to pork chop hill and he said it would be a great book to read because it really gave a good account of it. I also wanted to choose a military novel because as a future officer of the Army I wanted to see a first had account of military strategy, which is what it gave me.As I read the preface, I found that SLA Marshall was a brigadier general at the time and he was a military operations analysis officer. And that this book was recounted from the perspective of surviving soldiers through interviews immediately following the fighting. This intrigued me more to read it because I knew I was getting a first hand account of what happened at Pork Chop Hill.I feel this is a must read as future officers, because it is an extremely comprehensive book on military strategy and combat."
4,"Give me more, Les!","Les McCann continues to shine with Talkin' Verve. The energy is clearly displayed in Sad Little Girl, Boo-Go-Loo, and Sunny Part 2, but is also evident in many of the other tracks. There is only one minor criticism. I am a great fan of McCann's song Compared to What, but I wasn't overwhelmed by it on this album. It has been better on other albums. That one flaw certainly shouldn't keep you from purchasing this album. McCann's continued vocals and soul/jazz style are truly a joy. Overall from top to bottom this is a clear winner and another of McCann's terrific efforts."
4,Toe Tappers for the body and soul.,"This is an awesome album that will have you tapping and humming shaking and swaying to the infectious beat of Mr McCann's soul bound boogie. If you have not had the chance to hear his music before, then line yourself up with some true ""talkin"" and introduce your self to the grand puba of piano - Mr Les McCann."
4,It's time to go to Mars!,"Every once in a while, I pick up a book thats tough to put down. I read this one in several sittings and as I read, I kept thinking of what a great film it would make. I make this statement because the novel is very visual, has a great cast of characters, and a story line with a interesting perspective on the first manned Mars mission. I like my Science Fiction with a heavy emphasis on science and technology, and this book delivered. I found myself deeply involved with the characters, and their situations as well. The last few chapters, especially the epilog, brought a tear or two to my eyes. I highly recommend this novel."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I felt like I was reading two books in one. When it focused on the Mars mission, the book was thought-provoking and seemed quite plausible (though I'm literally no rocket scientist). However, the characters seemed straight out of daytime drama; overwrought and not what you'd expect from highly skilled pros selected from the top of their respective fields for a Mars mission. The human aspect lacked dimension and the inevitable conflict in an isolated survival situation that could have been as fascinating as the operations aspect, was jarringly overdone."
3,Three for effort and scientific accuracy,"There is nothing in First Landing that you could not have gotten from watching the film Mission to Mars (which Zubrin helped create). The plot is boring and the characters are one dimensional. Zubrin cops out by using lots of verbalized thoughts, and it is distracting. At the end Zubrin gives us a revised version of the Turner Thesis (which he does excellently in Entering Space), but it comes out poorly.This is definitely NOT worth reading. But if he keeps trying, he'll get fiction right eventually. Give Zubrin two more books, and they'll start to get good!"
4,none,"Zubrin is a gifted and talented writer that can easily blend fact with fiction, and ""First Landing"" has all the right stuff: intrigue and wonder, clashing personalities and cold-hearted politicians, integrity and intellect, danger and the human will to survive despite the odds, dicovery and mystery both human and alien... Gary S. Potter Author/Poet"
1,read The Case for Mars instead,"If you have read Zubrin's The Case for Mars, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES read First Landing. Basically, First Landing is a poorly-written, unedited fictionalization of The Case for Mars (which, incidentally, is a largely coherent and compelling nonfiction argument for the feasibility of exploring/colonizing the red planet). DO NOT read First Landing. Read The Case for Mars instead."
3,"More consistent, doomier groove","..than their earlier albums, which tended to veer about with more abandon, for better or worse. This reminds me of Wire mark 2, in their late-80s phase. Like Wire, Bailter Space creates gloomy, low-key laments not so much howled as moaned. The trio does sound winded here after a previous and prolific stint of more and more intense, and introspective, records that probably did not gain them the larger audience they deserved in the wake of so many second-rate black-clad sullen merchants of drone. But, if you like their other albums, this is worth seeking out. My three stars are only in comparison to their earlier, and in my opinion, riskier and more rewarding, fresher, punchier efforts."
2,It's OK,"At first I really love the sandals, but as I continued to exercise with them it became harder and harder to keep the strings tight. I would have to stop and tighten the strings every few minutes. It got to be such a pain that I don't wear them anymore."
1,Why do they not check these things?,"I have to agree with the reviewer regarding the bad fit between the pot and the stand it sits on. It does not sit squarely and firmly but instead is wobbly. It will not tip over but neither does it mate properly and there is this little irritating wobble. When dealing with hot oil the last thing I want is for the pot to be less than secure on its stand. Also, the burner is too large in diameter to be slid in and out of position between the legs of the stand. In order to refill the burner you have to remove the pot and lift the stand up, then remove the burner. Who ever designed this fondue pot never used it, but it sure is pretty in the pictures."
1,no no no,we have had this for about a year and i am throwing it out today! the feeder is difficult to raise up as the bottom connects to the top through a series of grooves. it is difficult to get the correct placement to have both sides an equal height. i would never have been able to keep dog food inside. we eventually began using the bottom to collect our recyclables. the main problem is that the bowls sit in the unit and it is very easy for food and water to collect underneath. it can get really gross down there.
2,Description is deceptive,"I have no idea if this product actually works, as I purchased it based on the fact the description stated it treats up to 8000 gallons. However, the instructions on the bottle state to use 20 oz. for the intial treatment for an 8000 gallon pond and 10 oz for an additional application after 2 weeks. The bottle is only 8 oz. According to the instructions on the bottle, 8 oz. will only treat 1100 gallons, not the 8000 advertised.Shame on Amazon for selling a product with such fraudelent claims!"
3,"great game, but too easy.","the game is great for just shooting stuff up and having fun but theres not a lot to it. based on the events of the US occupation of Somalia. you will fight as a army ranger in the mogadeshu city assault. its fun but again, not a lot to it."
1,Too small,No one seems to sell the old fashioned 3 t0 5 gallon jugs to catch a full day (or night)of output. Many males produce 3000 ml to 4000 ml within a 12 to 16 hour period.Does anyone know of a med supply who still produce and sell this size?
3,I don't think dealer would choose theses,They are microfiber and works like it. BUT they are smaller and thinner than other I have brought. BUT it's been like a year or 2 and still using them. you make the choice.
4,Psychotic story of an underused character,Spawn fans often dog the character Jessica Priest. Why? Because she took the place of Chapel in the overall arc of the Spawn mythos. I would submit that Priest would be absolutely LOVED had she been introduced as anything other than the assassin of Al Simmons. 'Lost Values' contains a three issue story from the sorely missed 'Curse of the Spawn' series that delves into the absolutely psychotic nature of Jessica Priest. It also contains a single issue bonus called 'Deadland' (CotS # 22) that feaures some zombies and a new character: Hatchet.
4,Past Forgetting My Love Affair with Dwight Eisenhower,"My overall impression is that the book is entertaining. It appears to be fairly accurate with respeect to the time and places mentioned. the book is used as a source document in other books about Eisenhower. Considering the period of time it covers, it moves at a fairly good pace."
1,DO THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE SINGING???,This is supposed to be a Christmas album. Please explain to me why it is then appropriate to include a setting of the Pie Jesu?!?! That is for funerals!!
3,Barely OK,"Good musicians, but choice of songs not to my liking. Would have enjoyed more traditional songs. That's about it, I do not have four more things to say!!!"
2,A biography that is not worth your time.,"An poorly researched biography that, while long, still does notprovide a full picture of Woodrow Wilson. Even after 500 pages I stilldid not know much baout the TWW's inner workings; what made him tick. There was a paucity of documents used as examples, despite his being President for eight years. He is given to us as an automaton, moving from one job to the next, and we are never privy to his superior intellect. Go read McCollough's bio of Truman instead."
2,MISPRINTED COPY-- OCT 2010 and DEC 2010,"I've purchased this program twice from Amazon and both times the version I recieved was a misprinted copy. When trying to use this book to supplement coursework for a Clinical Neuropsych class, I noticed pages are correct up until 486, then suddenly pages 391-438 repeat, then book jumps to page 535 and pages 487-534 are missing! That means that certain sections are missing, like the section on the agnosias and a page from the alexias. Amazon has assured me they are looking into it. I also contacted the publisher (the APA) who have also let me know they are pulling this printed version off the shelves of their vendors and that they will only supply the corrected copy from now on (but they refuse to replace my incorrect version). Amazon has graciously agreed to accept a return of the defect product and I hope that sometime in the near future I'll hold in my hands a copy of this book that is printed correctly."
4,Great PDA for the money,"Right now the 5500 is around $200 and it is hard to beat this PDA at that price. Sure the 5600 and 6500 have fancier features, but they are still priced too high. The best thing about the Sharp Zaurus running Linux is the enormous amount of free software that has been developed for it. You can make this little PDA do ANYthing! My only gripe is that Sharp hasn't put more effort into making syncing the Zaurus with Linux easier out of the box. It's as if they assumed a Linux PDA would only be popular with Windows and Mac users. How dumb is that? Otherwise, my favorite PDA."
4,Nice Product!,"Sharp has done a great job with this PDA. I love the fact that it has both an SD/MMC slot and a CF slot. I can use the SD for storage and the CF for wireless connectivity. And with Linux as the OS, there are lots of free / low-cost applications and games around already. I was a little disappointed with the image viewer on large JPEGs (1600x1200), but other than that it's great."
5,Using it now.,I'm writing this now ON the Zaurus using the web browser and a Linksys CF wireless card. Works great! All the linux tools are there. Set up is easy. Very cool!
3,Way out of date,freezes up and loses data when changing the battery. I was using it to rember appointments. It froze so stopped using it.
4,A great PDA implementation,"This is a pretty nice PDA with notebook like features. With it, I have been able to store lots of useful information and add tons of powerful software. The best part is that it support JAVA and is opensource so there is a TON of software for it. I recommend this unit for anyone who wants to work and play on the road."
4,The swiss army knife of palmtops,"After reading a variety of reviews on a number of palm devices, I decided to try the Zaurus. So far, I havn't been dissapointed with my decision. The Zaurus GUI is responsive and the applications appear to work well and intuitively. The text reader application did lock up on a huge file. Other than that, no problems.As stated previously, this product's greatest strength is the Linux OS that lies underneath rhe hood. I've downloaded a few UNIX shell based tools that have compiled and worked without a hitch. I love using Opera with a d-link cf wireless card. It required almost no tweaking and works great. The Zaurus is made of plastic but appears to be fairly durable. The battery is a bit underpowered on 5500 (The 5600 has a battery 2X larger.)If you plan on networking the 5500, read the security information regarding ftp weaknesses in early models.Overall, a great value for $200!"
1,Poor Underdog,"Had it in my hands for a few days, I'm happy it isnt mine.Its poorly implemented, the software is pathetic and the screen looks cheap. Not to mention the fact that it is an underdog in a market with thousands of professional-looking titles available for the palm or the pocket pc.If you are gonna spend money on a PDA, you'd better consider a Palm (Sony's are cool if you can afford them) or the new Pocket PCs."
1,Great idea but a poor implementation.,"Sorry Sharp, but I tried. This Zaurus SL-5500 PDA is a great idea, but it is poorly implemented and supported. The screen is great; I love the fact that is uses Linux; and the applications included with the product are just fine. **BUT** I have grown tired of the constant synching problems between my workstation and the docking station. I've tried for days to get this ...thing to work, and I'm giving up. I have read many of the postings on message boards, and I believe my frustrations are shared by many. I can't recommend this product to anyone unless they are interested in pain. Sorry, I tried. Buyer beware!!!!!"
2,Looked promising...,"...but no Mac support? Bummer. It seemed promising as an alternative to all the new Windows-based devices, but then I see the only OS's supported for syncing are Windows-based!If there had been Mac support, this would have been my Christmas gift to my hubby! Guess we're back to Palm."
1,Only for anti-socials,"If 60% of PDA users use Palm and 35% use Pocket PC/WinCE, why be the last 5% that use something nobody really cares about? As a Mac user I learned the pains of living on the fringe, and my advice to any potential Zaurus shopper is, stick with a mainstream device, i.e., Pocket PC or Palm.The Zaurus sports a nice hardware design, something you'd expect from a Japanese company. The software, while stable, is very unpolished and VERY confusing. There's also a lack of clear integration as on the Palm and also Pocket PC. Free software? You get what you pay for...In short, not quite worth the money and the label of an anti-social."
4,A very funny movie!!,"As a Peter O'Toole fan I love this movie. As usual he proves that he is both a dramatic and a comedic genius. The only draw back is Audrey Hepburn. Though I admit I am not a fan of hers (except My Fair Lady), she is a bit of a drag on this movie (a bit plastic). Having Paula Prentiss or someone with a little more comic flair would have been nicer. But, overall the movie was very funny with Hugh Griffith and Charles Boyer. Don't forget the guards at the museum too!!!!"
5,Parfait!,"This movie is intelligent, sophisticated, funny, warm and about as ingenious and clever as you can get. It's longer than I like a movie to be, but I loved every minute of it. And what's more, the robbery makes sense (giving nothing away), it would work, it's a devilish surprise but all believable. I liked it better than Ocean's 11 (not the original, I want nothing to do with sinatra), Ocean's 12 and The Thomas Crown Affair (again not the original which I thought was just nothing). The 2nd Thomas Crown was impossible which spoiled it, and Ocean's 11 and 12 were too complicated and far-fetched (though I liked all these movies anyway). And the 3 principals were a sheer delight to watch and listen to. I thought it was a warm, intelligent, clever movie."
5,How To Steal a Million,Great movie! Audrey Hepburn and Peter O'Toole do their usual fantastic job! Worth seeing repeatedly!
4,Peter Steals It,"This chic 60s caper is colorful and fun if a little over-long. Audrey seems to be a little old to be playing this part, but she's game and delightful. But the whole show is O'Toole. He's sensational here, very smooth and cool but also laugh-out-loud funny. I wish he had done more of this kind of light-hearted caper in his prime. He could easily have stepped in for the aging Cary Grant as the reigning master of this type of star-turn."
5,Funny and Charming,"Any film with Audrey Hepburn is a gem. The stunning scenery, and Miss Hepburn's outfits are elegant and timeless.Buy it and watch it over and over again!!!"
5,"Audrey, Peter, Paris","This is a wonderful, funny, sweet movie. There are hilarious scenes in it all throughout. It works from beginning to end. SEE IT!"
4,How to Steal a Million,Audrey Hepburn stars in this funny Romantic Comedy. You will fall in love with her as she tries to help her Papa get out of the mess that he's put himself in. Peter O'Toole comes along to help her but their's a twist in his motives. It makes for a very funny and entertaining movie with a sound track that fits perfectly with Miss Hepburn's personality.
3,It was too easy,"This is a pleasant enough romantic comedy, and Audrey is as fine as ever. Watch it, if you do, for the comedy and the romance, because as a caper it's a dud. The museum guards are too stupid (and comically played) to present a real challenge to our heroes.The movie especially suffers in comparison to the underrated Gambit (1966), another romantic comedy/caper released to cinemas just six months later; Gambit has all the cunning plans, twists, and above all the sense of danger and challenge that a caper film needs and which How to Steal a Million lacks."
2,Classy flop,"O'Toole and Hepburn mug and strut and read lines. Hugh Griffith is poorly cast. The script is extremely long, unbelievable, and speckled only here and there with wit. And, boy, is it light in that tiny closet where our stars are mugging and reading their lines.Wholly artificial and unamusing, this is one of the least of the 1966 films."
3,A bit outdated,"This book is required reading for my Human Behavior and Social Environment courses. While it makes a good basis for long-standing theories, it definitely shows its age. A version that reflects more recent ideas and events would be more useful."
5,Required reading for professionals,"This book is an excellent primer, along with the P&P book, for anyone who wishes to learn about the treatment of sleep disorders. In this second edition, you can find some of the most up to date info from internationally recognized sleep disorders experts. A must-read."
4,Sparkey,"This unit works adequate for providing a small amount of warmth to a specefic area. It does not provide the intense heat of a rdiant heater; but when you are moving air as fast as the Blue Blower does, it would be difficult to heat the air more than moderately."
4,A Book for Marriage Preparation,"Excellent preparation, well orgainzed with Scripture into weekly sessions for couples working together or with a counselor."
5,A must have book!!!,"We pastor a church and have found this book to be a must have for couples who are getting married and for those whom have been married for 20 years, like we have. We use this book for pre-marital counseling and require reading it for couples in our church that desire to be married. The wealth of information in this book cannot be duplicated in any other resource we have found in all our years of ministry!It is an invaluable tool for you! A must read!"
5,best resource I've found,"As a pastor, ""Called Together"" is the best resource I have found for use with couples in premarital counseling. This book asks questions of couples they may not have been asked before, including working on a budget, writing a common vision and mission statement, examining strengths and weaknesses of families of origin and so much more. A particular highlight are the sections regarding remarriage after divorce or the death of a spouse. I highly recommend this book for pastors, counselors, couples, and for those considering marriage in the future."
3,An inexpensive way to explore fiddling around,"Not a bad way to explore the fiddle if you are very sensitive to price. The video is privately produced by Lark in the Morning. Nothing fancy, but it covers the basic technique and includes several pieces to learn and is really quite helpful.The violin is about what you'd expect for the price. It's helped enormously by changing to a better set of strings and a bit more by upgrading to a better bow and rosin. You will probably also want to get a shoulder rest - even a $6 one.The case is adequate but has no room for a shoulder rest.If you're new to bowed instruments, you will find it frustrating to rosin up the bow enough at first - but hang in there!"
2,"I'd give 3, but the letdown from KTA 2 was too big.","Yes deserves stars for being Yes. But this is a big disappointment given the studio work on KTA 2. Only one killer bass riff -- is Chris getting lazy? Too much hep yadda, not enough odd meters and fancy instumentals."
2,Leave It!,"Forget all of the hype etc. It may be the best Yes CD in ten years, but it still falls pretty short of anything decent by this band. Dont get me wrong, I love this band. But imagine a Yes album where all members timidly hold back, and that pretty much sums this baby up. Only two decent tracks: 1st and last. And Yes - I did see them on their Ladder tour. Dont waste your money here, folks."
2,A Return to Form? A Return to Form?,"I saw the label on the CD and thought it was telling me the truth-that it was an album in the grain of Close to the Edge. Instead I got overblown lyrics from Jon Anderson (not that his lyrics were ever great but in this album you could just tell when he was going to sing ""love"" or ""heart"". And Alan White's drumming is boring and uninspired, as usual. I don't know how people can say he is the definitive Yes drummer and Bruford was not as good. Alan White could never be half as creative as Bruford. He does just standard drumming methods. It's like saying caffeine free diet pepsi tastes better and is more powerful than pepsi. Not to endorse Pepsi because Pepsi will kill you."
4,"If you like Yes's Going for the one and Tormato, then you will like this","This recording is similar to Yes's Going for the one and Tormato recordings made in the late 70's.That is, not as compositional as their classics in the early to mid 70's, but not a pop oriented as in the 90125, Big Generator period.Chris Squire's bass playing stands out as does Jon Anderson's vocals.Clearly a progressive rock album with a bit of pop touches, and not a pop album with progressive rock touches."
3,Bland songwriting keeps this Ladder on the bottom rung.,"No one really expected another ""Close To The Edge"" at this point in the band's career, but come on! The simplistic, mainstream songwriting on ""The Ladder"" really boggles the mind. Aside from the two longer cuts that clock in at 9 minutes each (not really that long, either, by Yes standards), Yes dispenses with any pretense of ""progressive"" music and proceeds to bore us with these radio friendly, sing-songy tunes that go absolutely nowhere. In fact, after the first minute or two of each song, you've pretty much heard it all and can move on to the next one. Me, I'll listen to ""Homeworld"" and ""New Language"" but that's about it. Yes seem to be going in the wrong direction (down) with this Ladder, when they should be ascending."
4,Well done!,"This is an o.k. later-era work, and I think it's their best '90s-album. There are no big surprises here, but in general the songs are more soulful and harmonious than on other Yes releases. Drummer Alan White provides some slightly funky grooves and the rest of the band works like a well-oiled machine. I'm glad this 30+ years old band still manages to make such an enjoyable album.The European edition of ""The Ladder"" contains a numbered paper slipcase and an additional poster of the cover artwork."
4,Yes returns to form,"The Ladder is a fine example of an album that most pundits thought couldn't be made: an album by a 30-year-old band that has sounds as fresh as the latest upstarts. Yes proves with this release that they ""aren't quite dead yet"" and in fact have a lot to offer to their loyal fans as well as new listeners. The songs range from ""classic Yes"" style pieces like Homeworld and New Language to the pop ballad If Only You Knew, which actually sounds like it belongs on a Celine Dion record (where it would probably sell a million copies). Lightning Strikes has a bouncy, almost danceable rhythm, and Nine Voices has the famous Yes harmonies used to their best effect. The Ladder will satisfy a lot of music lovers out there who might have said to themselves, ""Is that band of geezers still around?"" The answer is a resounding, ""Yes!"""
4,Yes moving fresh to the new century!,"To some hard-core, progressive old fans this album may not be one of the best in Yes history, however, it has the right mix of classic, epic pieces and modern, fresh rock. We ought to consider that this 30 years-old band is trying to move forward to the next millenium with a positive, modern approach. Yes, they were the pioneers of progressive in the 60's and 70's but they cannot live in the past. The Ladder's best tunes are the mini-epics ""Homeworld"" and ""New Language"" and show great moments in ""The Messenger"" in which the new guys (Sherwood and Khoroschev) really sound as Yes now. Special mention to ""Nine Voices"" in which Steve and Jon graciously give us a heartfelt, simple acoustic masterpiece as only these two virtuosos can do it. Godspeed in their tour! Hope to see them soon."
4,"Good Yes, but not the best or 5 stars","The was label was somewhat right stating the best since Fragile, & CTTE. What was right was Homeworld(The Ladder). This song is the best I've heard since those classic disks. Can one song be worth a whole CD? YES!!!!O.K. well add It Will Be A Good Day, New Languages,The messenger, Nine Voices and you have a solid CD. The rest of the CD is good pop music. It is not complete or 5 stars like The Yes Alblum,Closer To The Edge,Fragile, Going For The One, or Tormato( I know some of you will hate me for including this). This CD is comparable to Anderson,Bruford,Wakeman & Howe which is a CD any who love The Ladder and don't have it should check it out!"
5,A masterful creation to contrast today's formula rock.,"The Ladder demonstrates that ""music for the mind"" is still not dead. Having listened to rock music dating back to the late 60's, I find 90's music pitifully lacking anything to sink your teeth into. With the exception of a few prog rock bands (Dream Theatre, Rush and Yes), the musical soundscape is barren.The Ladder is certainly an exception, and as Jon Anderson suggests, a triumphant ""return to form"". The tracks are often reminiscent of the early Yes years, in particular The Yes Album, Fragile, Close To the Edge and Tales From Topographic Oceans. But the compositions are more than mere extensions of the 70's; they exhibit a newness, a fresh new burst of creativity.This effort bodes well for the new millennium. We can only hope more great works will follow."
5,"""Very nice Surprise""","This is a very nice album! Good job ! It's nice to hear Chris more "" frontal "" in the music again, kinda like the old days. ( i.e. The Yes Album"", Time and a Word"", etc. )This different from "" Keys"", in that it's more ""Simplified""version of Yes,. Like I said ""Like the old days"""
4,Lush and full of sparkle,"While some fans heralded this disc as Yes' return to form, I see it as more of an experiment in sound than any magnificent opus. The production is almost faultless and the musical performances are amazing. But with the exception of about 3 tracks and the truly amazing 'Homeworld', the material probably isn't even as well-written as the songs from it's harshly-received predecessor ""Open Your Eyes"". I'm not knocking ""The Ladder"" at all. But it's not the best Yes album of the '90's... the studio disc from the first ""Keys To Ascension"" set claims that prize."
5,Very satisfying,"An excellent look back at the seventies but still looking forward to new musical frontiers. ""Homeworld"" is among the best Yes tracks ever. Get this CD!"
3,Excellent composition carries the day.,"As a Yes fan for the past 23 years and having seen them in their mid-seventies heyday, it seems to me that this recording is quite reminiscent of that time period. While not necessarily an instrumental showpiece, the overall quality of the songs and melodic sense displayed is excellent. Standouts on this CD are: Homeworld, Lightning Strikes, and most definitely: Finally. I don't think there is a weak track on the CD."
5,What a way to take Yes music in the 21st century,"A rememberence of the old style, with a still new flair. A great combination and definetly worth a listen..."
4,quite good for Yes - but this is still not their best,"I am among those long-time Yes fans who firmly believe that Yes peaked long ago, with The Yes Album, Fragile, and Close to the Edge. Their drummer Bill Bruford felt the band could only repeat itself after those incredible albums, and so he moved on. And he was right! This album, while better than many latter Yes albums - especially when you consider the quality of the production, which is excellent - is just not very interesting musically. The title cut is wonderful and IS musically interesting. Just loved it! But I miss the Steve & Chris background vocals; I don't like the Billy Sherwood/Beach Boys effect present throughout the record. I wish Bill Bruford would rejoin the band and give them a spark!"
3,Sappy Sweet and Incomplete,"Clearly one of the most talented rock acts ever, however, on this album they are still off on the pseudo spiritual track displayed by Jon Anderson on most of his solo projects. Some fairly interesting instrumental work. Lyrics are needlessly sappy and detract greatly from the album. For, example, in the song entitled ""If You Only Knew"" Anderson sings that he will ""Pick the flowers from your floor. Put them in your arms for your my love."" Sounds like some awkward prose from a bad Valentines Day card. Lyrically, this album is wanting. Instrumentally, this album shows that Yes still has it. I wish someone would relieve Anderson of his lyric writing duties because he can still sing, Yes can still play, and I beleive they still have the ability to produce another progessive rock classic in the same league as ""The Yes Album,"" ""Fragile,"" or ""Going for the One."""
2,"Homeworld is great, but the rest...","is just a bit too popish for my tastes. Mr. Howe has lost something on this album: presence. New Language has some nice moments and Nine Voices goes over well but the rest can go. After sitting with this album for some time now I find that after being a Yes fan for some 22 years now the band just doesn't do it for me the way they used to. The lyrics for the most part are on the silly side. Jon Anderson used to be accused of writing lyrics that were too cryptic but I will take the lyrics of Close to the Edge and Siberian Khatru any day over If Only You Knew and its like. Even Anderson's voice is a bit grating in spots and I never thought that would happen. Still, they are giving it their best shot and that has to be worth at least two stars."
5,If you like the old stuff you will like this,"Outstanding album! Where has this been for the past twenty years?If you love ""classic"" yes, you will love this album. Play it loud!"
3,This cd has not aged very well,"I really liked ""The Ladder"" when it was released in 1999. But 2 and a half years later, I must say I do not listen to it much. Only a handful of tracks really catch my attention, I find the rest a bit too ""light"" for my taste. Too bad because the production if top notch. But there are much better Yes albums that deserve a listen."
5,"""IT'S WHAT KEEPS US SO ALIVE""","The best album from this ageless band of pioneers of progressive-rock. Simply stunning. Finely crafted songs, with power depth and emotion, which get stronger with every listen. From the walking, suspended bass-line and classic (yet stunningly innovative) prog-rock chords from ""Homeworld"" to the delicate refrain from ""Longwalker"" this is one seriously wondrous story.... Not only do the guys play and sing as well as they ever have done, but the production (from one of the masters) is flawless - every note, every nuance, every harmony is displayed beautifully. Have no fear of seeing a new name in the line up: Igor's key-work has a prog-classical awareness that is rare - and complements the musical powerhouse of Jon, Steve, Alan, Chris and Billy perfectly. The whole thing has a ""first-album"" freshness to it which not even a brand-new band can match.... - up-and-coming bands listen in and take notes from a band that's done it all, and can still deliver the goods!"
3,"Not their best ever, but their best in a while!","Well, after several years of mediocre albums, ""The Ladder"" is a worthy comeback. ""The Homeworld"" is probably the best song, it has a great melody. There are no really bad songs. Hopefully Yes will just keep getting better!"
5,from one the 1st Yesfans!!,"Netherlands is one of the first countries where Yes break through. I'm Yes fan from the beginning. I have all there albums, even boorlegs and visited all their concerts. The Ladder is one of theit bests, together wits, Close to the Edge, Fragile and Topgraphic Oceans. Just bought Ladder, and even my kids love it, they play it themselves, this is the best compliment !!!"
3,Better than the previous,"Yes is back with a better cd than their previous ""Open your eyes""I like this cd a lot, even if I give it only three stars, three stars for me is a good album. There is some great track in this one like ""Homeworld"", good ballad also like ""It will be a good day"" or ""If only you knew"" The sound is very good and you can feel happiness and joy when you listen to this cd, I don't know why, but this is what I have felt. A good cd to listen on a beautiful summer day !"
3,Yes back on track,"I would give this a 3.5, but there is not an option for that. And 4 is just a tad bit too high. Yes starts to gel again on this recording, and thank god this was not OPEN YOUR EYES II. (their horrid recording before this one). Songwriting, especially with HOMEWORLD and other long pieces stands out, and gets attention. Prog coming through. Very good stuff. Sounds like Yes is preparing itself for a good record off of a terrible one, and they did just that with thier next recording MAGNIFICATION. Great stuff. Plus on Magnification they get rid of Igor and Billy. Great move."
5,The Best!,"I have purchased everything by Yes, even the solo work since they put our Roundabout. Close To the Edge will forever be the progressive masterpiece of our time and I will always feel that Going For The One sounds wonderfully fresh, no matter how old it gets.Other than that it has been the never-ending hope that they would be able to put out something close to the work that they had achieved in the past. Well they have, The Ladder is simply fantastic. For the past month it's all that I have listened to. I love the new Santana but this is truly the best CD of the year. Thank you YES."
4,Trevor who?????,"Throughout the 80's and most of the 90's I had ignored one of my favorite bands....YES! Trevor Rabin took over the band and tried to reign in the style of the greatest progressive rock band into a 3 minute radio friendly format. Big mistake. Listening to The Ladder takes me back to the heyday of progressive rock. The epics; Homeworld and New Language, hearken back to the days Roundabout and CTTE. The Messenger shows what Trevor could have accomplished had he just some of the talent of Jon Anderson and company. Tight, polished, and well written it is among the best of the Yes albums I own. Now I'm looking forward to Magnification."
4,Yes Reviatlized,"The Ladder is a successful latter-day Yes effort, and undoubtedly their best studio album since 90125. The opening title track is a mini-epic that features some nice sections, and, in particular, the beauty of the piano/acoustic guitar coda is mesmerizing. It Will Be A Good Day (The River) is another good song in the same vein. Lightning Strikes is also a strong track, that features a surprisingly-cast horn section. If You Only Knew is a highly touching ballad. The Messenger and, especially, New Language are great tracks that recall classic 70's Yes without sounding dated or trite. Come to think of it, that's a good way to describe the entire album. Successful from any way you care to look at it, The Ladder is a highly interesting album from a veteran band, that has chosen to carry on and expand upon their signature sound without retreading old ground."
2,YAWN,"Nothing new. Same old tired songs. Bring back Rabin; I'm getting sick of Howe's twangy guitar. This CD, as well as the one before it, lacks substance. It's a good fit for the 90s, though - a decade of poor quality in every type of rock. Maybe the next decade will have fans demanding more. Until then, don't expect it."
3,Better than what they have done in a long time,"If you are expecting what people have been saying about this album, just forget it. Yes will never reach the peak of Relayer, Close to the Edge or Fragil. I can tell you this, it is definetly better than anything they have done lately (since Tormato onwards to be specific) It is nicely balanced, nice vocals and good guitar work but you just keep waiting for that amazing gret mjusicalo moment that never comes. Keyboards by Igor are great but HE never reaches the quality and brilliance of Moraz or Wakeman. Steve work on the guitars is great and shows why he is the master of masters. Chris is superb and Jon's vocals are as good as ever. You cannot avoid finding the influence of Jon all around the album with his ""New Wave styles and thoughts"" Overal a nice album, definetly better than anythin else I have heard in a long time, but for sure not the best of yes."
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"As a huge Yes fan, both old and new, I found The Ladder to be uneven. The music is great but there is no direction to it. Jon Anderson's vocals are as good as ever but it seems not to fit. Most of the songs attempt to sound like ""classic"" Yes but the beat is all wrong. No song jumped out at me except Nine Voices, but not enough. I'm hoping after more listening it will grow on me."
4,Lightning Strikes More Than Once For Yes.,"After several albums in the mid 90's that felt disjointed (Keys To Ascension 1, Keys To Ascension 2, Open Your Eyes), The Ladder is a fresh collection of songs from a band that has been churning out music for over thirty years. Probably able to appease fans of old-school Yes and fans of 80's Yes alike, The Ladder offers some of Yes' best material in quite some time. The first seven minutes of ""Homeworld"" can easily be placed aside tunes like ""Close to the Edge"" and ""The Gates of Delerium"". ""It Will Be A Good Day"" proves that for all its instrumental prowess, Yes is still capable of writing creative, simple pop songs. ""Lightning Strikes"" and ""The Messenger"" are two examples of Yes trying to remain creative and exploring different musical ideas. There are only a few weak spots on this disc but the strong qualities of disc more than make up for it. A must for any Yes fan and even a good introduction for someone who is new to Yes."
3,"Finally, after 20 years ...","The extensive noodlings are pleasantly absent, the groove is back, and what's that? Do I hear rock 'n' roll? I do! I hear rock songs! With riffs! I am not yawning or bored! This is a good album. Jon Anderson's usual spacy-cheesy lyrics prevent the album from being really good, but something in the water in Vancouver, B.C. (where The Ladder was recorded) finally woke these guys up."
2,A Return to Form? A Return to Form?,"I saw the label on the packaging for this album and thought,""maybe i should buy it to finally see if Yes got back to good musick"". Instead i got an album that was not as bad as 90125 but not so great. It isn't the music itself, which is ok. Jon Anderson's lyrics and singing just gets worse and worse and cornier and cornier. You can just tell when he is going to sing the words ""love"" or ""heart""-not creative. Anderson's lyrics on CTTE were much better, albeit not the greatest. And Alan White's drumming is always rather monotonous-he always uses the same style, unable to mix anything up remotely like Bruford did. I don't really understand people's ability to not only call him a good drummer, but the best the band has ever had. It's like saying the new Caffeine free diet coke is more tasty and refreshing than Coca cola Classic (sorry for the plug, Coke will kill you)"
2,Nothing new...,"If you are a YES fan get it. Specially if you are one of those who like CTTE and the '70s stuff. I don't want that YES change it's music. But I think that's time to review the formula. They did something expressive in '70 with Howe and Wakeman. It was different! In '83 with Rabin, they started a new era. It was different again without loosing the quality. But now! What they are tryng to do? The same kind of songs they did 30 years ago? I think it's the wrong way. I'd like to see a better finish in YES history..."
4,It's pretty good 3.5 stars,"I have been a Yes fan for a long time. But until now I've only listened to their earlier albums, Fragile,The Yes Album, and Close to the Edge all are excellent albums. The Ladder lacks something that those albums have. Maybe it's the absence of Wakeman, but whatever it is brings the quality of this album down. It opens up with an awesome piece, Homeworld (The Ladder) resembeling some of their earlier work. Homeworld is an awesome song and it's what makes this album worth buying. The other songs are only average Yes quality."
3,Not a bad album for what was once a legendary band,"Yes is still legendary in their concert performances, now beginning the 40th anniversary tour. The ladder isn't a bad album either. I think the Keys to Ascension studio tracks are much better though. The ladder features that great progressive feel but just lacks a bit from the ""old days"" of Close to the Edge and Going For The One. If you are a true Yes fan you must have it but if you are stuck in the 70s then you might not like it.However, if you didn't like the 80's Yes, don't worry this doesn't sound like that at all (I happen to like the 80's yes, so this is just an FYI thing). Magnification is a more interesting album for me and I hope that it wasn't the last Yes studio album ever. Would be nice to hear one more."
4,YES is on a rebound!,"Excellent CD. It's about time guys.I can once again say I feel proud to be a YES fan.My favorite tracks are the first and last.This CD reminds me a little bit of their ""Fragile"" CD.Highly recommended!"
5,GOING FOR THE MILLENIUM,Why say needless words. Buy the album. Listen to it and discover why it's 5 stars for almost everyone who wrote a review.
3,Pretty Good,"This certainly is a lot better than Open Your Eyes. But a return to ""classic Yes""? Hardly."
5,I must correct my original review,"I must apologize to the band on my initial blind review of the CD when it had just came out. Let me explain to those that music is best appreciated when savored and lived with for second, third, fourth and on hearings. After living with the CD for many months, and seeing the band live twice this last year performing the material, I must say the songs have stong YES composition value. To get a better idea of what I am saying, order and view the New DVD, House of YES, filmed at the House of blues: It is essentially the same show that I seen in Philadelphia. Having the new material performed Live is very instrumental appreciating the album. David_Carlin@Vtel.com"
2,A Bit Dissapointing,"I've been a big fan of Capt. Fingers for years. This album's production qualities are a bit too sterile and syrupy for it's own good. It's fine that Lee wants to get the CD heavy airplay on the smooth jazz stations, but he would be just as well cutting back on the slick electronic drums, samples, and mounds of processing on everything. The two Sonny Rollins tunes are excellent, with more of a B-3/Guitar/Sax melody interplay. It just doesn't come close, however, to matching up with his groundbreaking works like ""Festival"" or ""Harlequin""."
2,This is Junk,"This just doesn't do anything for me. Lee is a sensational guitarist, and I listen to most of his '80s and '90s albums a lot. This one is just too random, with nothing that really reaches out and grabs you. Try anything else by Lee first."
4,"useful book for individuals, studios","Not many legal jargons, easy to read guidebook for non-lawyers. As a practicing lawyer, I also like the book because it provides useful information not directly related to legal theory but practical tips for licensing (e.g. royalty negotiation). Will be great if more contract templates are provided."
1,Dated Information,This book was a disappointment. The information was old and dated. The internet was mentioned as if it just arrived on the scene. It's time to shelve this book. Don't buy it.
3,"good info, boring read","This book has some very basic information about licensing, but it was difficult to understand and still didn't give much insight on the topic."
3,Magnets fall off,"After a year the magnets of both have fallen off ...... duh, is this another shoddy ripoff Chinese product?! ....... duh....... You betcha!! We are being taken to the cleaners as a nation and I would like to know what we can do about it? Who is benefiting from this bleepin junk we are spending our hard earned money on?"
2,For hardcore Gino fans only....,"I am also a long-time Gino fan, but this one disappoints. The orchestrations and Gino's vocals are lovely, but the CD lacks the classic Vannelli passion and creativity."
1,The Title sets the Tone,"Unlike the brilliant ""Yonder Tree"" Slow Love is a ride to nowhere. Who told Gino to tone down his vocals? On the title track it sounds like he's cooing.The highlight is the re-make of ""Down with Love"". If you listen to this track first you'll say ""Hey, this will be good"". Sorry, personally I can't stand it and its made worse because I have all of Gino's albums but ""Crazy Life"".I am reluctant to conclude that perhaps ""Yonder Tree"" should have capped his career."
4,Bakery Car,I also bought the Logger Car also can't wait for Christmas to run these together with the rest of the train. I hope my Grand-daughter notices the two new cars.
4,Move over Cyrano,"This book is a great idea for anyone who has been overcome with feelings of love but don't have the words to express those feelings. There is a poem for almost every emotion under the sun. The language is down to earth and modern and gets to the heart of the matter. The words could be yours, so don't be afraid to use them. Move over Cyrano de Bergerac!"
5,The Best Reference Guide to the English Language,"A terrifically useful reference piece, and of incalculable value to readers, writers, and students of the English language."
1,Doesn't work with Windows XP SP 2,"I wish I could tell you more about the product, but I can't get it to load. Apparently the security features are so robust that it won't run if you are using XP with service pack 2. After contacting tech support we had a run a hotfix (and hour and a half on the phone with Microsoft tech support as their download file was corrupt), then I installed the hotfix, the program ran one time, and now won't work again.I guess the answer is that if you really want the dictionary you might as well cough up the $800 and be done with it."
5,Perfect,"What can I possibly add to what has gone before me? Not for everyone, this incredible tome (or, rather, TWENTY of them!) is a weighty reminder of the turbulent and varied history of the English language. Actually, it IS for everyone. One soon gets lost in the story; each page providing splendid new wonders, and forgotten comforting vistas. How did I live without it?October 2010: a few weeks ago I noticed an issue with Vol 3 - pages 890 and 892 were blank. After some to-ing and fro-ing with Oxford University Press (OUP), I was sent a reprinted copy of Vol 3, this time with all pages printed! Customer support with OUP was fantastic. OUP did acknowledge there is an issue with Vol 3 in some of the printings, and that they intend replacing all faulty copies. So, check vol. 3!"
3,Excellent reference... poor quality.,"It goes without saying that the OED has no equal. The content is a lexicographical masterpiece. The compact edition, though potentially unusable for those with poor vision, is the only practical format for this content.I do have an issue with the quality of the book itself. My first copy was not quite in alphabetical order. The book was bound out of order, so that pages 2143-2238 were intermixed.Amazon seemed eager to remedy the problem and sent me a second copy. This copy had a number of misprinted pages where the text ran off of the page. Also, some of the pages were partially glued together causing them to tear.After this, I was effectively told to deal with it. Amazon refused to send a second replacement (this is their policy). Oxford University Press required me to pay shipping.I chose to live with my first copy. It's still a fantastic reference, but considering its quality issues, I can rate it no better than average."
1,Packaging,This twenty volume set weighing in excess of 140 lbs. was packed in a 65 lb. maximum capacity box. The box was totally demolished and only 14 of the 20 volumes were delivered. The volumes that made it had crushed corners and scratched covers. I repacked the remaining volumes in 3 separate boxes and sent them back. I would really like to have this incredible set of dictionaries but am afraid that if I order them again I will get the same result.
5,"Say what, governor","This is the ultimate referance on the English Language and while the cd versions is not perfect, the core is true.I've used this since it first came out, both version 1 and now version2. This second version's copy protection is much better than version one, which would check for the installation disk with every use. The copy prevention routine is a drag, but a small inconvience to access the contents of what is the greatest English dictionary ever compiled."
5,You need this book!,"The BEST one volume reference work ever. Although the print is tiny, the accompanying magnifying glass make this a great tool and fascinating conversation piece for your coffee table. The etymological information is comprehensive and the usage citations present an eclectic progression of meaning through time."
1,"Unfortunately, pirate version better","I purchased this product few years ago and really had a genuine interest in learning words at a deeper level. Looking back, the one barrier that prevented me from doing so is the need for CD validation. Worse yet, the pirated version DOESN'T require CD validation. So I'm actually mad they've handicap US - The actual customers! While others who ""stole"" it had a better, more convenient version. This is a pretty big lesson for me, and I definitely won't waste my money on DRMed products any longer."
3,Warning: not for eyes over 50,"You can read the other reviews regarding the text, which, being the Oxford English Dictionary, is the best English resource there is. Sadly, I can read a phone book, I can read maps, I can read the fine print at most websites, but I cannot read this version of the OED with the supplied magnifier. I need to use a second hand held magnifying glass with the supplied magnifier to see the smaller fonts. This will probably go to my nephew, and I will either save for the 20 volumes or do without--or wait till they have the wisdom to go to 2 or 3 volumes for people with aging eyes."
3,Middle aged eyes will struggle with this edition,"Other reviewers of this edition discussed the smallness of its print, but having read all the reviews I decided to order it anyway. Well, the content is superb. Definitions are astonishingly thorough, and the quotations add fabulous depth. The size of the dictionary itself, tho large, is manageable. But the font size is just too small, even with magnification, to read comfortably. In fact, I laughed when I saw it. Women - dive for your glasses!! Scrunch up your face!! Add bright light!! I'm returning this edition for the two volume instead."
3,OED,"OED in one giant book! But be aware that you really can't read anything without using magnifying glass (you get one with the book for a reason). So if you will only use this book in those rare occasions where all your other dictionaries have failed you (here presuming that you are at least an advanced student of English because otherwise you don't really need it although you may want to have it anyway) than it might be the right choice for you. If however you intend to use it frequently then perhaps the 6-book edition of OED might be a better way to go although costing 3 times more - either way you look at it, it is quite an investment."
5,Essential for any serious lover of words,"Forget the CD-ROM version, this print edition is the way to go. Fantastic etymological history for any and every word. The level of historical detail is phenomenal. Kudos to the entire OED staff for continuing to make this the ultimate word reference source."
4,Quick and informative,"If you're looking for a ""fictional"" account of the events to transpire in 2012, this is a good place to start. It's a quick read with alot of good information and references. It ties in many different sources to provide a wholistic perspective of the coming years and ultimately gives a positive outlook for our future..."
3,I'm Judging a Book by its Cover,"The content of this book is fabulous. Sumner makes a very good case against humanitarianism of all shapes and sizes.However, I would not recommend this publication. It is not sized like a regular book. It's perfectly legible, but I prefer something closer to a rectangle than a square shape."
2,Speak Slowly Please,"The first section of this course was fantastic -- they pronounced each French phrase very slowly, had you repeat each syllable, and then sped it up to full speed. However, after the first few lessons the slow, careful pronunciation ceased, and the French came flying at me too quickly to hear clearly. This is supposed to be an audio-based course, so the book is not very inclusive and offered little help in deciphering the speakers. I'm very dissapointed."
4,Bonjour,"I like this tape very much. I think they should leave a little more space for repetition even when it isn't an ""ecoutez et repitez"" part. Otherwise very good and fun."
2,"first cd good, the rest useless","Completely agree with the others, the first CD is great, I was learning French, then put in the second CD and it is like a whole different program! Completely useless. They go so fast with barely any interpretations of the French. I feel like I need to learn French and then maybe use the rest of the CDs to review pronunciations. That's why I am on Amazon right now, to find another program to learn French."
5,Drive time French,"This is the best idea, listening and repeating the languages, when l am on my way to and home from work.I even wake up in the morning remembering what l have learn on the day before.Recommended to all who want to learn a lanugage fast"
4,Satisfied with my purchase,"I bought this because I wanted to re-engage my French skills during the time I was in the car. This disc is specifically formatted for hands-free activities. You will not learn how to speak French just from this disc, but it does provide you with some basics of grammar, vocabulary and conversational skills. If you want to see the material in text format, there is an accompanying book."
5,Looking Backwards at Evil,"Occasionally when I was reading Time's Arrow, my wife would ask me a question, and I would look up, thinking I had already answered her. That's how complete the spell is in this novel. Narratively gripping and technically stunning"
1,Disappointing,"An enormous disappointment.I have usually greatly enjoyed Martin Amis's novels. Sadly, not this one.The central premise is a neat one but there is more truth & beauty in the single line from Vonnegut describing the bombers flying backwards over Dresden than there is in the whole of this book.Somewhere in the middle of this book Amis loses interest in the central premise. Maybe he is bored by it, maybe he lacks the intellectual rigour to see it through or may be he knows that the first 100 pages simply do not measure up and only the huge advance keeps him going."
3,Interesting idea for a book but does not really deliver.,"The claim to fame of this book, I suppose, is that the plot runs backward in time and follows the life story of a man whose identity we don't really know. It does render some curious effects for the reader, such as most of the dialog running backward. The prose itself is at times somewhat confusing. If you are interested in a short account of the (backward) life story of a nazi doctor and his personal role in the holocaust this may be your book. But why bother? Why not read either a real account of such things or a good si-fi book which has the time travel angle covered a whole lot better than most prose fiction writers could ever do. Cheers. RW"
4,"good, but been done","You know, didn't Kurt vonnegut write a dream sequence in Slaughterhouse-Five in which Billy Pilgrim watches a World War II movie in reverse, reversing the morals just like this? Only, Vonnegut wrote it decades before Amis? I like Amis very much and thought that he executed the idea pretty well here, but I wish I could shake the thought that the idea really wasn't too original..."
2,"Beyond its one-note ""concept,"" this is fluff","Bereft of a truly original interpretation of the tragedy, Amis uses a single ""neat"" and ""cool"" idea, then writes an entire novel around it. Like much of Amis's other fiction (see, for example, his New Yorker story that reversed the roles of superficial screenwriters and deep-hearted poets), this book does not offer anything beyond its self-satisfied initial concept. Everything else is filler; it is not a compelling read. Amis is vastly overrated."
1,tiresome gimmick of a novel.,"if it is one thing i hate in a book it's a gimmick. gimmick writing is almost never clever or interesting or good, it is simply a gimmick. the gimmick here is that mr amis writes the novel backwards. the story, all dialogue, everything is backward. end to beginning, this, like all gimmicks, gets real tiresome, real fast. years ago i read mr amis's book ""money,"" which i loved. i have been looking forward to reading more of him, so this came as a great disappointment. don't waste your time."
5,Surprising Change in Narrative Pattern,"I realize that other authors have broken with the linear narrative pattern, but I have to say that the way Amis broke down the life of his protagonist here, by telling his life backwards, was amazing. I doubt that many writers could figure out a way to still insert some sort of social commentary, and yet Amis manages to do just that. I loved the way he snatches us right up in the beginning with the character's death, and we then spend the rest of the novel trying to piece together how or why he died, what he did in his life, and how these experiences shaped the character we saw in the beginning/end. It's an interesting read, and one that I'd recommend doing in one sitting if possible!"
4,A Very Creepy And Thought-Provoking Book.,"I got this book out of the library having virtually no idea what it was about. I'm glad I didn't know cause then I might have put it back on the shelf. The Holocaust is not an easy subject to read or write about,to put it mildly. This book turns the tragedy on it's ear by telling it in reverse,which was not clear to me at first. When it did,it was quite a chilling,ironic story. Not an easy book,but it raises many questions that would make it an interesting ""book club"" selection."
5,One-Day Read,"Not a Gimmick.This novel doesn't use narrative experimentation as a means to be 'cute' or 'clever'. I'd think we can give Amis more credit than that...he's using the structure as a means to comment on existence, on time, not really a grandiose theme when you consider human life...that is, our entire way of being and seeing is wrapped up in memory, deep-rooted sorrows, things of the like.Profound? Yeah, but not pretentiously so. Very very readable, could not put down, lots of surprises, plenty of social commentary but not as mere propaganda.A nice hybrid between middle-brow and high-brow fiction.If you want to stretch your brain and wrap around something not only thought-provoking but entertaining, read the book."
1,Did not enjoy!,I had been looking forward to reading this book after reading the review in the New Yorker. I found it difficult to follow and have attempted to read it a second time to make sure I didn't miss an important element...
2,A hollow book not rescued by mere technical trickery,"This book just leaves me cold. The technical premise is interesting (if unevenly done) but ultimately pointless. ""Tod"" is the German word for death, and that's what Dr. Tod is - Dr. Death. His horrible life story is, ultimately, one not worth unreeling - backwards or forwards. These technical tricks by writers are great when they work - which means, when they engage the reader. This semi-backwards narrative, however, failed to really engage this reader. Good riddance, Dr. Death!"
2,Dull and uninspiring,"I make no pretense to being a literary critic, and I do not wish to be uncharitable, but this book is not exactly a page-turner. For me, at least, it was a tedious read, a real bust. Not only did I find reading a story backwards an unexhilarating experience that was totally off-putting and not the least bit fun or interesting but, to top the whole mess off, the story itself was like rowing across a yawning sea of boredom."
1,You pathetic little man,"Find the Holocaust's gone stale? One of history's great crimes getting dull and need a makeover? No, I didn't think so either.Amis, a brilliant stylist with no feeling for character consistently found anything more than clever lightweight books beyond him. The story of Tod T (geddit?) Friendly is told backwards. Writing a whole book backwards in time is an overextended gimmick. Dragging the Holocaust in (nearest available Great Theme) does not change this into an important novel."
5,a comprehensive and fascinating look at the life and art of,"This Cannes Film Festival selection takes a comprehensive and fascinating look at the life and art of the legendary Pablo Picasso. During the last 22 years of Picasso's life, film maker Edward Quinn had complete access to the artist. Through a combination of exclusive home movies and intimate photos, as well as over 600 of the artist's works (many never seen in public), a living, breathing scrapbook of Picasso is realized. The film follows the parallel development of the artist's life and work, giving insight into his creative processes. Among other highlights are some of the last pictures ever taken of him."
1,Limp,"Hearing this CD was a huge shock for me. McLaughlin's music (which I'm really familiar with) got such a limp, whimpy tratment by the Groningen Guitar Duo, and I don't think McLaughlin deserves it. If anything, I would expect the musicians who cover his repertoire to put some fire into interpreting it. This duo is merely caressing the strings, sounding very tentative. Plus, they don't seem to take any chances, which is utterly in contradiction with the original intentions of McLaughlin's music.The music on this CD sounds lifeless, and the players are getting dangerously close to being flatliners. They somehow managed to scoop out all the guts from McLaughlin's music, and I don't think that's a good thing."
5,Like nothing else,"I loved this film! Especially interesting is the look at 'Graceland Too' and the astounding lengths that some people have gone to preserve the memory of a true original, Elvis Presley."
4,Loved It!,This is a great doc. Different from other things I have seen about eElvis. I have watched it several times and get something new each time.LW
5,loved it!,this is a great independent doc in the spirit of errol morris- great characters telling their own stories. i loved this movie.
2,album: miami,"i have been touch for two songs!!: summer guest ,and over the edge...there are pretty cool!!.The composer is Belgian and his music is esasy to listen...;i wouldn t buy this cd for two songsof course!!but this is my point of view,by the way i hate postal service.peace and love!"
4,heavy duty,"Just as discribed, very good quality & heavy duty, (but rather expensive), however if you require 12/3 this is the baby,,,"
5,Great source of knowledge,Very good book...good explanation of all aspects of motorbikes...I really came to know good deal about carbs and suspension from this book... I will recommend it to any sports bike enthusiast.
5,Extremely thorough and detailed yet highly readable,"As an avid reader of both Cycle World's and it's precursor Cycle magazine's 'TDC' column, I had long awaited a compilation of Mr. Cameron's thoughts and insightful observations on various aspects of the motoring world. This book has not disappointed me in any way, and has provided hours of fascinating reading as both a form of reference text and an entertaining commentary on current and past states of the art. If you're looking for more than a ""how-to"" guide, and actively seeking to understand why things are so, this is the one. Bravo, KC, more please!"
5,Remarkably Useful,"Talk about putting the maximum amount of punch on every page of a book. This book packs loads of useful and detailed information on every page it small font. The pictures and diagrams are useful and informative. It will take you a while to read and it gets technical, but it will teach you so much you will just love it. It explains the intricacies of how and why your motorcycle works in a sharp, clear, and instructive writing style. I found it a gem to read and own. You must buy this book if you want to know as much as you can about how bike's work and why."
3,Not wonderfully written or organized.,"While Mr. Cameron's understanding of the workings of the modern sportbike is obviously more than adequate to help sportbike owners understand the whats and whys of all aspects of sportbike functioning, he would have done well to have used a co-writer with more writing experience. I found myself having to reread several sections before I could pick out the pieces I was looking for. Many of the drawings were also crude. Very technical, but overall interesting and somewhat helpful to any sportbike owner."
4,Don't let the cover fool you,"Despite the misleading cover, this is a wonderfully compiled book of all things related to how a motorcycle handles. I passed over this book several times because the cover made me think it was a book on how to do wheelies and stupid sportbike stunts. I could not have been more wrong. This is a must have book for anybody who likes to wrench on their motorcycle in the garage and wants to improve upon the design without making things worse. Cameron is brilliant at explaining the physics of how and why a motorcycle behaves the way it does without having to delve into the intricate mathematical equations so commonly found in books of this nature."
5,Good info for beginner on up,"This book is very informative and simple to read. Cameron easily educates you without getting too technical. In about 15 minutes he had me understanding the operation of a turbo system without boring me with scientific jargon. He covers all aspects of the bike. Good for people who want to know about exhaust, jetting your carbs, suspension setup, etc. Loved it."
4,Outstanding information but poor organization.,"The book cuts through the ridiculous claims made by many aftermarket parts companies. It covers pratically every performance modification you can make to your bike, listing the advantages and disadvantages of each. By far, the best part of the book is that it explains the ""why?"" behind the modifications so that you can make the best decision based on your individual riding skills/style. Firestone and Ford should read the section on tire pressure!"
1,A tragic waste of Paper,"I have always found Kevin Cameron to be an interesting and thoughtful writer, but this book is nearly useless. There is virtually no hard information and its' most common theme is that KC did something in the past he now thinks was a poor choice and he expects you will do it too, whether he tells you it is a bad idea or not. If you are looking for advice on how to tune your bike, or when to tune instead of replace, save your money."
3,"great serial, awful picture & sound","I know this DVD is cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for here. No restoration has been done on this 1934 serial, so we get very hissy, muffled sound and plenty of scratches and flecks etc on a washed-out, very rough-looking print. Oh and an alpha logo popping up on the chapter titles cards. The RHS text of some of the opening chapter summary cards is also cropped off.This is the only DVD version available at the moment, so by all means buy it, but be prepared - you will certainly not benefit from DVD quality!"
2,The Best Serial produced and the worst reproduction,"What a shame that possibly the best of all the movie serials produced should be one of the worst available, technically. Except for the annoying performance of Sonny something-or-other, the acting is good, John Davison is superior. What a fine speaking voice. The first chapter has too many loops of the same bomb being dropped, but from chapter two on, the continuity is more than OK.However, the quality of the dvd print is terrible, just awful. The sound track is bass muffled and audio gain control non-existant. I've viewed many old serials from a number of distributors but this one is pathetic in quality.I would pay a premium price for a good copy of ""Perils"", if one existed. And if I only had one serial, this would be it.I give 4.5 stars for the serial acting and content. One-half star for the technical quality. It gets the one-half because at least the dvd exists."
4,Fun Movies,I had seen the original black and white version of these episodes when they were silent. This version is still fun to watch. I enjoyed them.
3,Pauline Is Not In Peril,"I had hoped that this would be a compilation of the original Perils of Pauline - but it turned out to be a rehash of the type that sprung up in the 30s and 40s. While the offering itself is a good representation of the serial genre, it was not what I had really wanted. However, old movies, like old art, may become more enjoyable later on."
3,Blue water?,"This product does shade the water but it didn't turn my pond blue, it turned it green. It looked like it needed to be cleaned.It only takes a tiny bit to color the pond and be sure to wear gloves or you will have blue fingers for awhile.I got tired of people saying my pond was full of Algea because of the green color so I cleaned it out."
2,interesting topic but rather obtuse writing,"The book describes well the complexities of relationships- between the son, Will, and his father, Sonny; between Sonny and his wife Aila; between Sonny and his lover Hannah, between everyone and the political situation at hand. However, the frequency of pronouns can be confusing and the long, impassioned dialogues never directly state anything at all. One must already be familiar with the apartheid and liberation movement to fully comprehend the book."
3,This book was very confusing!,"I am a freshman in high school and I was required to read this book for a summer reading project. I found everything very confusing, from the political aspect to the relationships throughout the novel. It made me feel horrifically dumb and I am planning on telling my english teacher that this year. It shouldn't be required for 9th grade students, 11th or 12th maybe but it was very difficult for myself and my classmates to read and understand. I did realize, after visiting this website that it was a very good novel and I enjoyed it a lot. I would really recomend this book and website to anyone above my age."
4,"style is rich, intense, down, real, and beautiful","Although the Album is very rich, I'm looking for ""Ladies Man""----that piece is real from generation to generation...."
4,Latins lessons learned,"When I decided that learning Latin would further my career, Essential Latin was the book I chose. Although it starts off with the hard stuff (grammar, cases etc.), it gave an excellent view of latin, and also insights into the history of ancient Rome. Filled with comical cartoons and ancient quotes to translate, this is the essential book to learn latin from. There is an Audio cassette available throught the publishers."
1,not satisfied,one of the c/d players is not working at allthe reason it was bout is so we could have 2 c/d player and so happends that only one works is not acceptable. Yes it was used but it does not say taht is not working at its fulest before we purchasteed.its nof fair.
1,Blurry,"Even though the manufacturer, a chemical company based in South korea, claims 28mm dog pitch, it's very blurry. The colours are washed out, and the contrast is poor... For better price, go with Kogi..."
5,Warriner's English Grammar,"I am thrilled to have a copy of this book in my hands once again. It is the text I used in High School. For me, it is the definitive reference for common American English spoken by educated people during the '40's, 50's and 60's. As my English was refined during those decades, ""Warriner's"" is my first choice for grammar and syntax. All this is to say that ""Warriner's"" may be out of fashion. In the age of ""Word Perfect"" and ""politically correct"", all the new adaptations of English are missing. However, when I am speaking with a person who can explain herself/himself along the lines of ""Warriner's"", I tend to listen closely and attribute a higher level of intelligence to the speaker. This book remains a valuable tool of the English language."
5,Pure Mad,A movie that stirs the inner senses that someone could control so many people and do what they want. This movie is worth watching and taken on its own merits as to your own opinion. I enjoyed the movie very much as I have a huge range of interest as to pictures for my collection to sit and watch.
2,Poor treatment of interesting subject,"This movie took a fascinating topic, and made it boring. The acting was bland, the screenplay was trite, and the directing was amateurish. It was a made for tv movie, that really wasn't even up to tv movie standards. At just a little over an hour, there was little time to develop the characters. I have read several books about this man, who was called 'The Morman Manson'. This should have been interesting, but I was bored after about 20 minutes. I only finished watching it because my husband wanted to see how it ended. He really didn't like it either though."
2,Talented but just over the top,"It is hard to judge music from the snippets available online. I purchased this CD, but wasn't really sure. When I received it and had a chance to actually listen, sometimes I just burst out laughing. Midway through every track you need to brace, because you can hear it coming, all the heavy-handed octaves. This man is so enormously talented, but, honestly, over the edge. If the tracks are busy, it is not because of the selections elected for medley; the musical choices themselves work well. Some of these tracks would be so nice if he just knew when to quit. I purchased a second copy as a joke gift. :)"
5,Best Piano Christmas CD ever!,"David Lanz? Jim Brickman? John Tesh? Move over guys... John Bayless has done what no others could... Taken the xmas classics to a new level of musical enjoyment! By combining the songs together, and making them so rich and full of life, this will be my favorite Christmas CD for a looooooooooong time."
2,Not worth money,"Thank goodness I borrowed this book, because there are better investments out there.It's ironic that Kevin J. Anderson has a blurb on the book's cover, because I was just about to compare this book to the terrible Butlerian Jihad novel by Anderson in terms of writing style--not a good thing! This book isn't quite as bad, but that's the only good thing I can say about DEATHDAY. I, for one, am not even going to contemplate buying the sequel. This book has no literary soul, and no resolution of any kind either. What's worse, it lacks any of the qualities I would expect in a Dietz book. His novels had been going uphill since Legion of the Damned, with strong characterizations and intricate portraits of fascinating universes. This book lacks effective character development, and there is NO fascinating universe, just Earth on fire. There are too many good books out there to waste time on this product--using the word literature implies too much that just doesn't apply here."
1,"Painful, trite and overdone","I realy wanted to like this book. I picked it up looking for a new author. As others have noted, racism plays a big role in this book. It's not done well. The author manages to pound the issue into nearly every page regadless of wether it would fit the plot.Those that noted that the aliens seem to share human motivations and actions are in my opinion, correct.I had to give up on this book after about 50 pages. Like others who have reviewed it, I love sci-fi, I thought I was getting a good action packed aliens-vs-human thriller. What I got was a heavy handed morality play that could have been better by a third grader.When I found out from reviews that author actually decided to write this as a first in a ""series"" I gave up. I rarley put down a book unfinshed. It bothers me to do so and I probably would have finished this mindnumming tale if it had been a stand alone novel.I cannot recommend anyone read this."
1,Disappointing,"I just didn't like this book. I think that the racial overtones were over played. I've always thought that the human race would unite against a common enemy, especially a human killing ET. Dietz did do a good job with the action sequences, but there were not enough of them. The book waffled between an action book and a political book and did a poor job at both.Pro- good action sequences, different plot and take on humanityCon- too many alien names, personally, I just didn't like the plot. Story seemed very sterile with really no emotion.It's a short book if you want to read, but i would take a pass on it."
1,Bad book = bad feelings,"I am not sure whether I should feel angry, depressed, or foolish after reading this book. Angry because I am tired of constantly being assaulted by authors who inflate their since of self rightousness by casting whites as the font for all racial evils in the world. When the Earth is invaded leave it the whites to keep racial hatred alive while everybody else has the character to rise above it. As for being depressed, that is simply because I was hoping for an enjoyable story which was nowhere to be found. Cookie cutter characters (none of which I cared about) coasting through improbable and rushed plot lines aren't good combinations. Finally, as you can probably guess, my foolishness came from ever having bought this book in the first place."
1,Death Day lacks any depth.,"This book is a pitiful excuse for an alien invasion story that hinges heavily on race; that of the humans and the aliens, who are just as stratified,race minded and backwards as 1875 America(reconstruction era).I only have one thing to say: Mr. Dietz lacks any and all knowledge of race issues in America, unless he is dealing with white racist--which was shallow at best. I found the lack of African-American conflict in: 1) becoming slaves (again!!) and 2) becoming overseers, as a profound white-washing (at best) or an intentional oversight (like a lazy student with a forced term paper) into the true effects of slavery on a culture...AND a country.I recommend using this book to hold up the end of a wobbly table because nothing else--the plot, characters, or the pitiful attempt to deal with the race issue--can stand up under the conscious eye of the reader."
3,Writing not that great,"Unfortunately I bought this book before I thoroughly read the reviews. Don't get me wrong I love sci-fi and invasion stories, but I don't like his writing style. There was not enough science, although he sure likes to describe guns. The racial component of the storyline seemed unnecessary and distracting. The characters are undeveloped and much of the plot is predictable. This book ends in a cliffhanger, and I was still tempted to buy Earthrise just so I get the satisfaction of finishing the story. I've decided against it. I'll probably skip this author in the future."
4,Nothing like independence day... save the destruction,"I enjoyed this book quite a bit. How much did we see of the aliens in Independence Day and War of the Worlds? Almost half this book deals with the Saurons which is the best part as far as I am concerned. Looking forward to Earthrise. For those who think this is the worse book in the world, you should get out and read some more."
1,Death Day? More like: Boring Day!,"I was looking for a word to describe this book and nothing other than ""horrible"" or synonyms came to my mind.I borrowed this book from someone at work because the little synopsis made it sound interesting, I should have reminded myself to never judge a book from its cover. To make it short, this book is boring, I usually read a book in a couple of days but this time it took me a month just to get done with the first chapter. This book is so full of cliche' that will bore you to death before you even try to understand what's going on. The characters are just so flat, they lack any kind of personaly, and every single military member acts exactly as you would expect them to in a B series movie.I never gave such a negative review to a book, but if you have some spare dollars you can find thousands of great books here on Amazon, starting with Stephen Baxter. Stay away from this one!"
3,I didn't plan this i promise! I just hope my Deathday is better!,"Deathday by Eugene Bruce would be better? Maybe, maybe not who knows - but being an impoverished author i won't apologise for shamelessly promoting my debut novel Deathday by Eugene Bruce - I'd very much appreciate you checking it out that's DEATHDAY by EUGENE BRUCE - I love you America!"
3,the locust swarm alien,"Action, action, action and a lot of blood and guts...Action adventure is what has made sci fi a crowd pleaser.The aliens are not really very evil or very smart either.Except for racial memories they resemble crabs or insects more than intelligent beings. They have what are very like raccoons for slaves:not very willing slaves. You may not be able to judge a society by the technology it uses, if that technology is stolen.It is a fast read and to get the end you have to buy the next bookwhich is always a bummer."
3,Deitz left his build up for a lame charade of the last chaps,"This was a good sci fic story. His build up leads everyone to believe some great multi-character scandal that will leads to some great multi-scandal ending. He fails horribly! And I mean HORRIBLY! This guy couldn't see a proper ending if it fell on him and kissed his .... Either he got too lazy to write or he didn't stick to his creative guns to make it right. Both consequences, are consequences to himself and his readership. I will not buy one of his books again!!! He has no finishing power.Bob Manni"
2,William C. Dietz is a name I'll remember (and avoid).,"Interesting enough that I did finish reading it, but confusing (or perhaps just more tiring) trying to keep track of the different species of insect aliens and their ""hierarchy"". If it had been a ""complete"" story, I would have walked away with a review of fair, but it was especially disappointing to get to the end and find out it is the first of a series (which I won't be continuing). 2 stars may be a little generous, but I have to reserve 1 star for those I won't even finish. I'm going to make an effort to read these reviews before buying from now on."
3,The Christmas Gift,Service from this provider was prompt and came via USPS. The condition was good which is what I expected it to be. Thank you
5,christmas gift,"simply brilliant it was a long wait for it to arrive but worth it, especially if you like christmas and John Denver"
4,Remembering John Denver,"Due to it be an old VHS - the quality wasn't the best, but the story line was very cute. Will keep it to share with the little ones for the holidays"
3,Worked sorta,Would not fit with out spacers. The thread was US fine but the socket heads where metric. Go figure.
2,No drivers,This mouse is kind of large and awkward to hold. The CD that came with this was BLANK and there are no drivers on their web site. I've learned after buying a couple of Creative Labs items that their customer support is sorely lacking. I won't be buying any more of their products anytime soon.
4,well built stand,I really like this stand .... it is well built and so nice that it is tall enough for me to bring the stand up to eye level. My one complaint on this stand is that if you load it too heavy (for me my windows tablet and a few books) the stand starts to fall down. I had to purchase a shaft lock separately to keep this from happening. I really think that at this price they should come with a shaft lock. Otherwise a very nice stand and with the shaft lock it is awesome.
3,"Not her best, but an okay read","There are some very well played out love scenes and seductions in this book, but the story is a little thin. She has SO MANY better books, but you can see, even in this one, that Ms. Becnel can really write and write well. The heroine in this book is a little young and immature and longs for her life at the convent just a tad too long to make sense. What is she blind? She's got the best man in the universe panting after her and she wants to pick up the veil. Please. The clue that this out-of-print book was not a keeper is how many copies are available used."
3,decent delivery on promise,"I think this book did a decent job of delivering on its promise. For this reason I give it a 3. As for real world usefulness, I give it a 2. I found it helpful for a person like me, who not totally new to java (the language), wanted to move to the JBuilder IDE and learn how to get things done quickly. By following the chapters, I was able to quickly get Java applets up; creating applications and using JDBC. I also got a good idea of how to manipulate these things from within the IDE.This book is for JBuilder beginners. If you are looking to learn Java or get into the real meat of the language then this book is not for you. This serves only to get you started with Jbuider and you'll have to do further reading in order to do any real world development."
2,"Not bad for basic skills, but database part missing","I have been using Borland products for 10 years. Java Builder seems to be very promissing, but unfortunatelly there are still no books which go beyond basics. This book is no exception. It can help the new user to find his/her way in new concepts, but it will not be of much help in solving crucial practical problems. Databases are not even mentioned in a reference."
2,I really didn't like it!,"The Virginian was such a snooze fest! I felt like Wister kept building up a story that he didn't fulfill on. The ending was really good and that's why I gave it two stars instead of one, but personally, I don't think a great book is defined solely on the ending. I think it should be amazing throughout and this one wasn't!"
4,The Virginian,I read this because I grew up watching the TV show. I was not disappointed in the book. There is nothing like a good western.
1,The Virginian,"Really boreing. Only made it to 40% read mark. I do not understand why someone would read it and like it, but we do not all have the same taste. I do not expect everyone to like what I like."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book in high hopes, having heard nothing but great things about it, but I was supremely disappointed in it.The book moves slow -- so slow that by the half-way point, I decided to lay it down. For good.Probably wrong of me to write a review about a book I didn't finish, but I was stunned to see there were almost only positive reviews. Maybe this will help a few future buyers be more judicious in their decision and at least read the sample prior to purchasing."
4,An Image of a Cowboy,"The Virginian is a wonderful story full of adventure and romance! The book is written from the perspective of the Virginian's ""city-boy"" friend, and the two enjoy several exciting escapades. One of the main conflicts in the story is between the Virginian and cattle-rustler/murderer Trampas. Throughout the story they are locked in combat, Trampas desperately trying to make the Virginian look bad and the Virginian trying to catch him before he stirs up more trouble. Enter Miss Molly Wood, dainty school teacher from the East with a family history and a mind of her own. Deciding this is the girl for him, the Virginian sets off on a comical wooing. A real western complete with a shootout, The Virginian is a thoroughly enjoyable book that keeps you turning the page and wondering what will happen next."
4,"When you call me that, smile!","This is the classic story by Wister (1860-1938) of the ranch foreman, known only as the Virginian, his courtship of Molly Starkwood, the ""schoolmarm"" from Vermont, and his conflicts with Trampas. In 1977, the Western Writers of America voted this novel as the top western novel of all time. It probably started the whole genre (even if one counts the pulp fiction popular in the late 19th century). Historians have always pointed out that there never really was a ""Code of the West."" This was just something thought up by writers, journalists, and film makers. The West was made up of both good and bad men, just as today. But, in my opinion, this book challenges that concept. Wister based his characters on real people he interacted with in the West a few years earlier. There really were men like the Virginian. There really were people who, unknowingly, followed a Code (just as there are today)."
4,"Not as exotic as I expected, but a fresh start for Krynn","I picked this book up not knowing what to expect. Could I really tolerate another drastic change to the world of Dragonlance? Then again, maybe a totally new setting would breathe much needed life into Krynn. (After all, this is Chris Pierson, how can you not read it?)What we get is an isolated continent, peopled with familiar races, influenced by familiar gods, but with a different twist on the events of Krynn.Pierson fills his new canvas with a good story: 3 separate and very different lives uniting in a bid to contain an ancient evil within the confines of its elusive relic. While the Taladas Trilogy may not turn out to be the powerhouse that the Kingpriest Trilogy was, it certainly appears to be worthy reading and proof of Pierson's potential to be the new voice of Krynn."
3,Get What You Pay For Really.,"Bought this lil guy when I first started smoking Cigars.It's fairly flimsy, and the blade started to dull after maybe 20 cigars or so it seemed.at which point I upgraded toCuban Crafters Stainless Steel Perfecto Cigar CutterHowever if your looking for a cutter to travel with, something for 1 time use, or something to take with you to a party, this guys certainly cheap, light, and WILL do the job. Just obviously not as well as some of his more expensive, well crafted brethren."
1,Not good at all,"This product barely works, cheap and somewhat dangerous because you need to push so hard to compensate for the weak blade"
1,Not a good buy--even a $4,The edges of the blades bent on a tobacco stem in the cigar on the third use! A very poorly made cutter that's not even worth the nominal price charged.
1,You get what you pay for.,"The cutter broke in my hand after two uses. Total garbage. I got what I pay for, it is what it is."
4,Works for me!,"Works great! Cuts my robustos clean and even. Great cutter and an even greater price. I don't expect it to last forever, but you can't beat it for the price."
2,Too small for robusto cigars,"It's a decent cutter for its price, but it would've been nice to point out that this cutter is too small for robusto size cigars"
5,As expected,"This product makes precise cuts and is fairly durable. Great value for the price. It came very quickly, and was packaged well."
3,"Not double bladed, but does the job","Only one blade is truly sharp. The construction is very cheap and I'm not sure what will be the life cycle of this product. So far, it cuts the cigar properly, even with one sharp blade.The shape is also different than the picture. It's more like a rectangle"
3,Good enough for price,"If you're buying this product, you're probably not expecting a really nice cigar cutter that you will use for years. If you want a cigar cutter that you plan on using for a long time, don't buy this. Invest more money and get a nice one. For the price, though, this gets the job done. It's rather flimsy and the blades are not particularly sharp, but it will get the job done. Hasn't broken after a few uses, so that's a plus. If you only need a cigar cutter that you will use a couple times for whatever reason, this is a solid product. Otherwise, it's pretty terrible."
4,not bad,"its not the sharpest cutter in the world, but does the job for the price. good one to have to just toss around, or leave in the car"
3,Hard to fault at this price,"They are cheap, feel cheap, feel flimsy, are wobbly...but...they actually cut pretty well for the price. I have a couple of Xikar cutters, and these don't compare, but these aren't $60 either. They do squish the cigar end a little, but acceptably minimally. Real cutters don't do this. Surprised at how sharp they actually are. I keep a couple of these in my desk for coworkers (mooches) and don't worry a bit about a $3 cutter getting lost. So cheap, you can buy 20 (which should last you at least 5 years if you are a heavy smoker!"
2,You get what you paid for,"This cigar cutter is not very sharp. If you are looking for quality, pay more than $3. You get what you paid for."
1,Shipped from Hong Kong??????,"Its been well over two weeks and now i know why, its shipped on a slow boat from hong kong!!!!!! or a very slow airplane, had i known this -- no order.evrything else arrives within days and i spoiledlar shipments."
4,Does the trick,This cigar cutter works fine. I have used it about 12 times so far and it still does the trick
3,"Good standby cutter for the golf bag, boat, suitcase, motorcycle or anywhere you might light up!","As the title says this is a good standby cutter for the golf bag, boat, suitcase, motorcycle or anywhere you might light up! Not sure how sharp it will stay but it seems to be better than the cheaper looking ones out there. The price is right so you can't go wrong!"
3,does what you need,"First got it and it looked and felt very cheap. You are getting what you paid for. works for what you need. cuts decent, doesn't ruin the outer casing of cigars ."
5,"Terrific Fun, but Warning!","This is a terrific fun expansion pack for Roller Coaster Tycoon on the Mac...allows you to build pools, slides, adds all sorts of additional rides, coasters, and water rides -- but WARNING!! I was playing on a Macbook Pro Dual Core - very speedy machine that absolutedly ground to a crawl once this expansion pack was added...I found myself removing it from the laptop and everything went back to normal - so it somehow eats up a lot of system resources. Works great on my mac G5 desktop."
1,Doesn't work on my new computer,"I have a new 15"" MacBook Pro, and this game does not work properly. There is something strange going on with the graphics... it draws weird colors and huge planes and rays all over the place, making the game unusable. I have a 2.2 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo, with a nicer graphics card than recommended, so I exceed the minimum requirements, but it won't run properly. By the way, RCT 3 regular works fine."
1,DON'T TRUST SOAKED OR ATARI...NO SUPPORT,"Please, read this and all other warnings before you buy. This soaked expansion pack does not work. I installed it on both a Mac and PC using XP and it does not work. I am now out the purchase price and will not buy another game from Atari."
1,this is a rip off!,"i got this game and it did not work.I tried installing it but it falied I wish it worked but it did not.Warning,you need roller coaster tycoon 3 to install this game. this is my opinion."
1,roller coaster,This was not the game my son was looking for. you failed to put in your add additional product needed for this selection. I was very dissatisfied and am letting my friends know do not use this site.
5,A resource for YEARS to come....,"Johnny Mac has put his life into getting this volume together and it shows. Filled with copious amounts of notes, maps, explanations and much more on virtually every verse of scripture, this is probably the BEST study bible on the market, bar none.My only caveats - there's a few small points here and there that I don't agree with, but they're open to discussion (i.e.- 2 Cor. 13 - Paul's thorn in the flesh).... but otherwise this is a pretty solid resource. He should've included a topical index like the New Open Bible does. Lastly, he needs to make this available in the ESV translation as soon as possible. Other than that- GREAT! I say get one right now."
3,Nice product if you like the author and Edition,"Quality product if you like MacArthur's notes, mentality and theology. You also need to like the NKJV translation, which falls short in translation at points due to the diverse source of manuscripts and resources used in translation. MacArthur is anti-Pentecostal-charismatic, which is his right, but he is tough on charismatic interpretative approach to Scripture, while claiming literalist interpretative position. The notes are factual [some are personal interpretations] but for me not earthshaking or as informative as some other study Bibles. NKJV translation leaves a lot to be desired, despite it's promotion as a successor to the KJV. Bottom line is for fans of MacArthur this edition will be easy to read from the top of the page to the bottom as well as Introductory notes and concordance, but I would not base my theology exclusively on this Study Bible."
2,Difficult to Navigate,"I was so excited to have this Bible on my Kindle.....only to find that it is very difficult, if not impossible to navigate from one scripture or book to another. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
5,A deeper study of The Bible,"I like John MacArthur and what he has to offer in the way of study materials. He is straight forward and has written many books I have read. The Study Bible is a must have for anyone in the Ministry and does Sermon preparation. I have other Study Bibles, but this one goes deeper in the explaination of the Bible verses. The Appendicies are very helpful and the Concordance is awesome. Due to my budget, I had to wait for a sale and now I own this great book."
4,A great Bible,I love my MacArthur Study Bible. I can now throw out all my bible Study commentaries now that John MacArthur has commented on every book ! My only complaint is that the concordance is not like my old KJV bible. It seems to be not a complete as my my old KJV study bible. oh well you can't have every thing.
5,ch,"This book is an excellent source for the beginner through the Clery.The MacAarthur Study Bible is a great reference book. I liked the fact that each book of the Bible has its own outline and sub headings of eventswith scripture reference. The Index gives you charts and maps. It explains how we got the Bible and how it relates to us. The book gives you the table of abbreviations,the authors and written date. This Bibleeven gives you an introduction to the division books of the Bible, overview of theology, concordance and the study notes with cross reference. If you really want to learn the Bible buy this book."
1,DON'T BUY THE KINDLE VERSION,"I'm fairly new to Kindle (3 months ) and bought this Bible thinking how valuable it would be to have on my Kindle. It is NOT KINDLE FRIENDLY! There are no quick links to chapters and verse - even difficult to get to the table of contents - All of the ""study guides"" are a chopped up. I have never managed my Kindle account from the computer so I spent the last two weeks trying to refund from the media I purchased - you can't do that either only to learn I'm 5 days past my 7 day curfew. Very frustating. Live and learn."
2,not for daily use,"Maybe I'm not getting it, but this version is very hard to navigate. I wanted an e-Bible I could take to church, but I cannot figure out how to find a passage quickly. It seems you have to go all the way to the table of contents each time, and if you click on a cross refertence there does not appear to be a way to get back to the original passage I was looking at without going through the whole process again. This might be a great version of a study Bible, but in its current format it is of little use to me."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased the MacArthur Study Bible Kindle Edition several days ago. I was very disappointed to see that the notes of the authur re: the verses explanations, etc. were not included. His commentaries before each Book were but not his notes. I have this Bible in hard copy so I was excited to learn that it was available for my Kindle but disappointed when it downloaded. I look forward to taking my Kindle out of town. I think the Bible should not be listed as a Study Bible but just a Bible."
5,Excelent Study Bible,"This is a great reference and study bible, John's comment on each verse are very accurate."
1,No notes on kindle version,I was very disappointed with the kindle version because it does not have the study notes that I love in his paper version. This book should not be sold as a study version.
3,Navigation,"Great resource. Good references. But navigation back to the table of contents to change a book is cumbersome. Even worse, after 8 months the new and old testament hyperlinks stopped working??? I know this has happened to others also. Now moving thru the books is more difficult!!!"
2,Sorely Lacking,"Do Not buy this KINDLE edition. It does not contain any of the commentary, or verse notes that the paper versions do. It is a waste of your money. Spend the few extra dollars and buy a leather, or hardcover. Hopefully, I will be able to get a refund.UPDATE: went onto livechat, and spoke to a rep. No hassle about the refund. Removed the from my kindle"
4,Outstanding Running Commentary,"Dr. John MacArthur, known as one of America's greatest current expository preachers, has taking great lengths in making a study Bible easy to use and still full of detialed information. The running commentary (notes at the bottom of the pages) is some of the best you will find.The commentaries pick up strength in the New Testament which has much to do with the Christian's soterialogy. The Topical Index section is simply one of the best on the market.Why four stars instead of five? Well, often in his running commentaries he provides only one view. This is especially true in regards to prophecy. His overview on Theology is quite good, but not excellent. Again he provides only one view in regards to eschatology, which is a highly debatable topic. I would have preferred him to present his view,even emphasize it then, add other views that are in the scope of orthodox teaching.All in all, a great study Bible and well worth having."
4,MacArthur Study Bible,"As a minister, overall, I've enjoyed studying the MacArthur NKJV Study Bible. There are those times that the commentary has nothing to do with the verse in question. I've learned to overlook this. I do not like the Topical Index at all. It is difficult to find specific Bible references. I would much prefer a Concordance.I have had my MacArthur NKJV Study Bible since it came on market. I must say that the publisher could have done a better job in putting the book together. The glue on the book's binding is not that good. The book cover has been working loose for years and is coming apart at the edges. Be ready to use a good glue to make repairs. Otherwise, expect pages to start falling out if you give the Bible much use. Also, this book is not intended to be held by those whose muscles are failing. It could be quite heavy for them. In spite of these shortcomings, I would recommend this book for serious Bible students."
5,"good,",This product was all that i thought it would be and came faster than any other products ordered the same day.
3,study notes llight ink,This is a really good Bible and I like the nice size print in the test it is of a dark enough ink to make for easy reading. i supposed when I ordered this version that since it was a large print version that the notes would be easier to read I expected for the notes to be smaller print which they are. I was surprised when the notes were of such light ink that makes them very hard to read. I guess that I foolishly thought that the printer would know that if one needs large print then he would catch on that the smaller print notes should be in a dark print also.
4,MacArthur always the best.,"i have used so many Bible commentaries ,yet i am not satisfied with the explanation, until i got MacArthur,useful for all the bible students and the truth seekers."
5,MACARTHUR STUDY BIBLE,This is certainly one of the best study Bibles available today. The product is excellent. Shipping was fast. Overall a great buying experience.
5,Happy with MacArthur,"This was a great choice. Print is easy enough to read if I can't find my glasses. Lots of cross references. Very glas I purchased it. I do miss the ""red letters"", but I have another source for that."
1,Non-biblical,"The author only wants to say that the Bible is perfect, where he means something superficial: no contradictions, nothing can be taken in a non literal way, implausible metaphysical and scientific doctrines, etc. The author does not consider that the message of a book does not coincide with the wording of it. As well, there are no considerations that to understand the message of the Bible we should understand the culture in which the Bible has been written, the aims of its being written, etc. These considerations would undermine several interpretative claim. In sum, the author see the Bible as a book of metaphysics and science, not of as message of love coming through Jesus."
2,A little negative,This study guide seems to be on the negative side for bible story analysis. Other than that the explanation of certain passages is good.
1,Do Not Buy!,"My wife has an older edition of this study bible. I was flipping through it to see what MacArthur says about various passages. I made a shocking discovery. He omitted 1 Corinthians 4:19-21. I never would have expected MacArthur, of all people, to omit portions of scripture. The newer editions may have remedied this, but don't waste your money. MacArthur too often massages scripture into validating his highly pharisaical worldview."
5,Tremendous,"The study Bible by John McArthur is the highlight of my ability to teach Sunday School as I have over the past 36 years. I've never come across a more easy to read, up to date, easy to understand bible than this Bible.It does such a good job, that before, I would have to spend hours using 4 or 5 reference books to really be ready to teach every Sunday. Not any more. Most reference books can't hold a candle to the work that was put into this edition. And McArthur is way ahead of most in deciphering the INTENT of each scripture. Wow. Not another one like it.Steve Harris"
4,Mac on the Mac,This product is as comprehensive as I had hoped and then some. It makes for easy and solid reading from my Kindle. I can also navigate quickly to find passages that I need. There is still so much to learn and a great deal of material to go through. But this Bible is organized in such a way that the navigation is a predictable pleasure.
2,"Good content, poor quality book","Good content, as always. However the quality of the paper in the book is poor. So thin the print on the reverse side is visible, making it hard to read, and the corners and edges of the pages dog-ear and curl very quickly. Too bad."
5,MacArthur Study Bible,I was very happy with my purchase of this Bible. I had purchased some before at other locations and paid much more for the same product.
3,Great edition; poor binding,"I have nothing bad at all to say about the MacArthur Study Bible text. It's been very helpful in my Bible study and I have found it biblically faithful in every way.The hard cover edition, however, is poorly constructed. I have only owned this Bible for six months, and pages are coming loose everywhere! The binding is broken in one place and beginning to break in others.I thought since I wasn't planning to carry this Bible around in my purse or bring it to church I would be fine buying the cheaper hardcover edition rather than springing for the leather bound version. Get the leather! You'll be glad you did. I'm going to have to buy this again!"
4,Extremely thorough,"The MacArthur Study Bible is an extremely thorough and researched study Bible. His many study notes brake down individual verses and words of the Bible to the most minute detail. For me, this has been a blessing and a curse. Also, be advised that are many words in his study notes that are difficult for the average reader to decipher. Such as simile, volitional, seminally, efficacy, inviolable, corollary, familial, cacophony, penitent, libertinism, recalcitrant, licentiousness, libation, soteriologically, and militates to name a few. Keep a dictionary nearby! This is definitely not a study Bible for beginners. But for those more learned, it is an immense and impressive work. Remember also that his many thousands of interpretative notes are his and his alone. I have the genuine leather edition and it is by far the most beautiful study Bible I own."
2,Macarthur a true scholar...but the Publishers shoudl be ashamed,"I will not fault this Bible's notes and study helps. I will fault however the cheap, cheap, cheap quality of the construction of this book. It will not last very long under prolonged use. I wonder Mr Macarthur...have you seen what these cheating publishers have done to your study Bible? Would you want your name and work sullied by these profit mongers who charge these prices for a substandard product? Money..money money..is the god of this world. Cuting corners on Bibles to make a profit should be condemned by the ministry. After all this is The Bible..not Oprah's book of the month.Disapointed!"
5,Great Resource For Getting Passionate and Knowledgeable About God's Word,"I received this Study Bible for my 13th birthday and have been using it ever since. It has been instrumental in stoking my love for God's word and maturity in Christ. Even after I have gone on in my studies and became competent in independent original language exegesis, I still find myself peeking at a note for a quick double check on my results. No two people can be expected to agree on every interpretive question in the Bible, but this Study Bible provides a faithful exposition of the entire text of the Bible by one of Evangelicalism's finest scholars and pastors. For anyone looking to grow in their knowledge of God's word, this is probably the best Study Bible around for consistent, trustworthy, and honest dealing with the text. You would be well served to use this work as a starting point for your adventure in handling God's word accurately."
4,Damaged,"John MacArthur is by far one of the greatest preachers out there, but my only complaint is that the book is damaged."
5,Awesome Bible,I bought this bible as a gift for my brother because John MacArthur is one of his favorite theologians- that was 5 years ago. He still has the bible and finds it extremely helpful during his bible study.
2,Description says notes but there are none for kindle,"The product description says ""Dr. John MacArthur has compiled more than 20,000 study notes"" however, they are not available in the Kindle version, so that's a false statement. Very disappointing. I'm going to try to return this. Note that the paper study Bible is fantastic but the Kindle version is a tremendous disappointment and falsely advertised."
1,Chapters missing in this edition,"My copy is missing Romans, beginning with chapter 2 and all of 1 Corinthians. I'm not sure if any other parts are missing but I contacted the publisher and they're sending me a new one."
1,Are you kidding?,"Thr study notes are useless on my Kindle. I have this downloaded on one device, that I can find, and when I try to download it to my iPad the book tells me that I have installed this on too many devices!? This is a huge waste of my money! Love the hard version of this bible, But I would not be able to recommend the kindle version."
2,The macarthur study bible new,"The book itself was in good condition, however, it was most definitely not new....just from my initial flipping through the pages..i have seen at least 3 pages that have been highlighted and written on pencil also. There is also a section in the 1st few pages in 1st Timothy had must have had something stuck in between the pages & then the book was closed with it still in the book, or it may have gotten wet & the pages were closed and crinkled and bumped that way. This may have been a book in good + to maybe even very good condition, but it was certainly not a ""new"" book"
1,The Bible according to John McCarthur,"While this Bible does contain some very helpful study notes, in regards to historical background of the Bible. McCarthur's blatant promotion of his own hard-line Calvinistic views and anti-charismatic doctrine is very disappointing. His notes in regards to the gifts of the spirit are harsh, and contain no Biblical basis whatsoever. He based his notes solely on his own opinion. Even as a long-time Baptist I can hardly stomach his divisive comments and rhetoric."
5,Exactly What Mom Wanted !,"Mom was looking for a study bible, and we found this one. Excellent condition, very fast shipping from the vendor."
2,Poor Quality Printing,"No doubt, an excellent Bible and commentary. My disappointment is with the poor quality printing. Specifically, the pages are so cheap, you see the printing on the reverse side while trying to read it. This makes it difficult to enjoy. I'd advise others to look at a copy prior to ordering it."
1,What a Mistake!,"I was so disappointed. I assumed since it was the Kindle Edition that I would be able to ""Go To"" a location by typing in a bible book name, chapter, and verse and GO THERE. But no. This was a total waste of money."
5,GREAT Study Bible,"MacArthur's NAS Bible has dramatically improved my ability to read, comprehend, reflect, and learn the Bible. The commentary is clear, concise and insightful. The margin notes bring a new dimension to the text as they typically cite back to original languages for context and clarity.This was purchased as a gift for my wife as a reciprocal for the identical one she got me for my birthday."
5,Excelent work done,"I am very pleased with this seller. I very appreciate the prompt communication, attention to detail and special commitment to customer service. To cut the delivery time of my order in half....they have given me a FREE Air Mail upgrade! Thank you very much for your great job done."
3,I don't care for the color,"I wanted to like this light since my last bulb only lasted for a month and I thought this one might have a longer life. I can not speak to its lifespan since I just got it (locally)and do not plan to keep it. This lamp gives my tank a very yellow/green look that I don't care for at all. It is so obvious that my 3 year old said the tank was green. I do not have live plants in my tank, if I did and was looking to show them off, this would be a good light. However, my fish look more dull than they did with my previous 8000k light. I will be buying either the Aqueon Color Max or the Aqueon daylight bulb."
4,"Cheap, But Decent","This little player has a decent sound for being so inexpensive. The sound is only a little bit tinny and was much better than I expected.Folding up the speakers is a little bit annoying, but not difficult. The little front piece that holds the iPod comes off so that you can close up the speakers. Then there is a short wire that wraps around the unit and snaps on. Then you slide the holder back onto the closed speakers.They work pretty well sitting on the passenger seat in my car. (My car's sound system is old and unreliable.) At top volume, they are just about loud enough to enjoy. My old, stick-of-gum-sized iPod Shuffle sits loosely in the iPod holder or falls out when in the car."
3,its ok,"its ok , just needed to come with plug, instead you will have to use 3AAA batteries for it to play , to me its more like a player and not charger at all. i still have to hook my ipod to my laptop for charging .this is better for people who wants to take something to work inorder to lisen to there ipod, its great for that,or the bathroom ,some place your cant take your stereo to."
4,Great For The Money,This is great for the money. I use it at work where we have to keep our music down to a minimum. This set of speakers works great for that.
1,Worked great then stopped.,I loved the device at first but then it stopped working a couple of days ago.
3,Very disturbing!,This book is very disturbing. There are some very sick people in this world to do these kind of things to others.
1,Specific Intent,"I can not believe the things people do in this world.How dare the author of this book write about a little girl and what happen to her.I am that little girl's big sister (Jodee) and have alot more than 1000 words to say about this.I feel that it is no one's business on what happen to Nichole. This was a hell of a year for the family and to take it and just write a book about it does not let her family put it to rest.I don't think that the author O'neil, had any right to write this book. All he is doing is making money off of my sister and her brutal murder. The people who did this act is and was sick in the head.This book just goes to show the world had sick even book writer's can be."
2,sparce,"Busch's music sounds very sparce. Various instruments mostly play solo, while chords are added just sometimes here and there. It is mostly homophonic and not dense at all. The lack of dense chords makes it sounding weak. Too gentle. I have never heard so sparce orchestral music, written either in 18th century style or otherwise. That lack of density makes his music in some sense ""modern""."
4,Owen & Mzee: The True Story Of A Remarkable Friendship,"I have been following the story of Owen and Mzee for months now and was so excited for the release of this book. I bought one for my nephews and one for myself. I love it, and my newphews have enjoyed it also. It is written for the older child when reading it, but the younger children still enjoy the pictures very much."
4,Heartwarming story with wonderful pictures!,"When I heard that a book had been written about the friendship between Owen, an orphaned hippopotamus, and Mzee, the old tortoise, I knew I had to get it. This is a lovely story that will warm the hearts of children and adults and can be used to illustrate resiliency, the strength of friendship, and how creatures that don't look alike can get along. This book is worth buying for the pictures alone."
5,A reminder that animals do have a soul...,"As my 7 year old and I read this beautiful story together, we had to take turns finishing each other's sentences because of overwhelming emotion. She was so inspired by their friendship, she immediately requested to go to any Tsunami-devastated country to rescue and take care of injured and orphaned animals! Our fellow creatures continually amaze me in their capacity to inspire and nurture our souls."
5,Great story for all ages!,I loved this story. I've told friends and family old and young they MUST read this book.
5,Heartwarming Story,What a heart warming story about friendship. A great gift for a child or adult! I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book on multiple occasions! I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to literally anyone!
4,Owen & Mzee: The True Story Of A Remarkable Friendship,"I enjoyed this book very much. I bought 1 copy for myself & 1 for a friend, as we had monitored the story since it first appeared the papers. We'd worried they would be separated. I was glad to know all the background & the pictures. Very sweet!"
5,Beautiful Story and Pictures,Heartwarming and inspirational story of a loving friendship that defies prediction and expectation. A lesson for us all in reaching out and in accepting love in all its' forms and the power of love to ensure survival.
4,Amazing Journey,This is a great account of this friendship. I would recommend for older children as the fantasy fictional part is missing for the younger ones.
3,Owen & Mzee: The True Story Of A Remarkable Friendship,Very delightful and heartwarming pictures of the baby hippo and the ancient tortoise. The text is brief and to the point. A great book for hippo fans.
4,Fantastic Story!,"Fantastic story, great for these turbulent times. Also recommend The Great Hippo Migration, fiction, for kids. William James Reece."
5,Destined to be a Child's Favorite,I bought this to give my neighbor's 6 year old son. Maybe I will get another copy for myself! The story is about unlikely friendship that is endearing and surprising. The pictures are great and the warm fuzzies stay in your heart for a while after reading the book. This would be a great read aloud to share.
4,A better kind of mellow,"If you would like a nice mellow album, but find yourself turned off by bands such as Red House Painters or American Analog Set, give Suburban Light a try. What separates the Clientele from the rest of the new quiet bunch is that their music always has a foot firmly planted in the classic rock tradition, meaning the emphasis is always on the songs, not the sound. There are whispers of groups like the Association and the Byrds scattered throughout the album. Obviously, with song titles such as ""monday's rain"" and ""6am morning"" you know what you are going to get here, but Suburban Light never gets boring. One of my favorite releases this year."
5,A Great Escape,"I have to say that I have recently been obsessed with this band. Once the music from any of the songs start, I am completely relaxed and my mind wanders into an ethereal state. The songs do sound similar but they provide a continuum of this peaceful state."
4,Wet,"Great tunes, though they sound as if they were recorded in a bathroom underwater. There are brilliant melodic ideas on this album, but one gets the sense that this is a band still developing. The musicianship is rough, which I guess is maybe kinda the point, but with structures so loose and open and mellow, it sometimes sounds like the tunes are about to fall apart. One hears the drummer meandering around tempos, some sections of songs just kind of sit there lifeless, only to have a brilliant verse or chorus kick in. I think that if you dried out the reverb, it'd sound hellova sloppy, like it's the first time these guys have ever played these tunes.Still, it's a really moody, mysterious, and enjoyable album."
3,A breezy tension,"3 1/2In the spirit of the best British retro bands that do not sound too obnoxiously derivative, Clientele streaked across the scene with Suburban Light, a relaxed, though darkened independent pop album that at the time, could hang with the best of them. Played in succession, a few of these intricate melodies begin to overlap one another, but taken track by track we see a focused rainy-day haze of 60's psychedelia merged with the gently edgy instrumentation and echoey production. These sad celebrations provide elegantly mixed emotions, even if only about half of these tracks feel fully fleshed out."
4,prime redux,Totally retro sound and production but I find the songs and just the overall sound extremely evocative. You might not want to let them get away with this but if you desire a smokey 60s throwback this is really good.
4,almost as good as THE BLACK WATCH,"when i first got this, i wondered if the Clientele were playing an elaborate aural joke on the world. there is so much reverb on everything here that the folks in Galaxie 500 might go ""whoa, guys, you are gonna need a sponge, this record's so wet."" then i listened to it...and listened to it. and in the best way i couldnt get it out of my head. simple perfection--or close to it. the only thing that prevents it from being a 5 star disc is that the songs sound a tad samey by track 10. nevertheless, this is almost as good as the best records of last year, which in my opinion, were THE BLACK WATCH'S ""Christopher Smart EP"" and ""Lime Green Girl."" get the Clientele."
2,I can't feel anything.,"The hipster hype for this record was so overwhelming I had to check it out. Wow, what a letdown. The whole thing is produced to sound like it's coming from a tinny AM radio. Cute in theory, but extremely frustrating over the course of a record. Totally fuzzed out and detached. Trying to connect with this record is like trying to enjoy sex wearing a full-body condom. It's all wash-out and fuzz and self-conscious retro detachment. The songs themselves, as they are, aren't without their charms, recalling the Byrds and Zombies and such, but you'd be much better off picking up one of those bands' albums then settling for this. Flame away."
5,A Touch In The Heart,"Ten True Animal RescuesTen True Animal Rescues was a great book.I would definitely recommend this book to all animal lovers.This book totally stunned me.It showed me how much these animals care for their owners and complete strangers!I could tell you that the best chapter I think is the first one.It's called Three-Alarm Fire.It's about a little hamster who saves a whole family from a fire.If you want to know more,then you'll have to read it to find out.So far out of all the books i've read in the fifth grade,this one is the best...."
5,My daughter LOVED these stories,My 8-year old is an animal lover and as we are trying to encourage reading this book was WONDERFUL. The stories are short enough to keep her focused but well-written enough that she gets detailed information as to the situations these wonderful animals faced that resulted in their heroism.I am now looking for more books like this one!
1,not what I had in mind',"I bought this book as a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I could not believe it when I received this ""collectible book"" and there was an ink inscription in in tthe inside of the front COVER!!!I was sick with anger at someone selling this as a collector item!I ended up putting a plaster over it with my granddaughter's name on it. So crumby!"
3,Ten True Animal Rescues,"Ten True Animal RescuesI wouldn't recommend this book unless you truly love animals and adventures. I thought some of the stories were ok and some of the stories were boring.If you think you like this book,just listen to this.A pony getting you to saftey!A dog saving your life!I know it sounds crazy,but it's all true."
4,One Great Book,"One of the best books i've read is Ten True Animal Rescues. This book had so many adventures. How would you like to be trapped in fires or get saved by cows? How would you like to be trapped in ice or trapped in a blizzard with no one there? How would you feel if you were getting attacked by a shark. See there are many adventures in this book. I would recommend this book to you if you like adventures and animals.By, Megan"
3,Animals,This book was amazing because you can see what's it like to have a frightning advenature. Can you believe this book is really true? Imagine being trapped in a snowbank where nobody could hear you. I think my favorite story was a hamster saved a girl life's.What if you fell in a gorilla exhidit? If you want to find out read Ten True Animal Rescues.

4,Animal Rescues,"I would recommend this book toyou because it was very exciting, and you wouldn't even believeit was true. What would you feel like in freezing cold water with only a dog noticing you? What if your house was on fire and only a hamster knew it was going on? What if you were about to get attacked by a shark while there was a strong undertow? What if your son or daughter was in a gorilla exhibit? If you want the answers to these questions and many more just read Ten True Animal Rescues and find out."
4,Awesome!,"This book was great! I would recomend this to everyone.I thought animals could only snuggle,play,and sleep. But I was wrong.Animals can do those things but they can also save lives. Imagine a 3,300 pound bull stamping on you or a hamster saving a family from a burning house!Theses stories are amazing just like the animals that save their lives.Review by,Lindsey"
5,Woman Dangerous,"This is great ""Women's Music Festival"" music! If that's what you're looking to hear, buy this album!"
1,Item delivered is not actually a Western Digital product,This item is advertised to be a Western Digital WDAD004-RNx part and the graphic image shows that. The actual item delivered is a no-brand item with no cable or document and the package does not list it as compatible with WinXP. Reviewing feedback shows that this Cables4PC outfit has a history of sending items other than what is ordered.
5,bad a#$ bass in a small space,"I'll admit it, at first I was a bit skeptical about buying one of these. But after reading the reviews, went ahead with the purchase. I am so glad that I did! This thing pounds like a pair of 12's. I have mine in a 2cf box with a 3"" port that is 7.75"" long. The excursion (Xmax) on these things is unbelievable. It looks to be at least 2"". I'm getting three more so I can put four in a box so as to wire them down to 1 ohm with a 2000 watt amp and truly see what they can do. I will post back and let you know how it goes. My kids say they can here me comin from five blocks away. That's with just one of these!P.S. this is my wife's account. I go by ""Big O""."
2,One-sided view of the Battle of Waterloo,"Joseph Goebbles, the former minister of propaganda would be very proud of Mr. Hofschroer's work here. This book is nothing more than a rehash of the German view of the battle and an obvious twisting of facts. Mr. Hofschroer's assertions about Wellington's character couldn't be farther from the truth. There have been countless books written on this subject and none of them have come to the outrageous conclusions of this bogus work. The Duke of Wellington gave the Prussians full credit for arriving in time to save the day at Waterloo in his famous dispatch. There isn't one incident in the entire military or political career of Wellington where he ever deceived any ally of his true intentions; only his enemies remained baffled. He was a true man of honor Mr. Hofschroer, which is more than I can say for you. Congratulations on distorting the truth. For readers who are interested in the events of June 1815, nearly any other book on the subject will do."
5,Condition of book was better than Described,Wow this seller is great the conditon of the book was better than described I bought it for my mother in law because she did not have this one in the series and It was Like Brand new she loved It. Great Seller
3,okay--a better use of time than a night of t.v.,"i found that joens has actually done some research of the nordic pantheon. i enjoyed his usage of the importance of faith and myth throughout his two books. the story line itself can get fairly predictable at times, however, i found myself doing side research in germanic mythology and history of the british isles--the research didn't appear terribly deep or broad, but still, a good introduction into the lifestyle, philosophy and heart of the period. i'd really like to talk to the author about his definition of myth and how it is used in practical living. moreover, i'd like to see the parallel conflicts in the faiths represented--nordic and judeo-christian. the representation of the christian faith was a little overt--the subtleties not appreciated, nor its strength."
1,"""Shadows of Eden"" by Michael R. Joens","I was very dissapointed in the condition of this book. I was led to believe it was new, and it was used but I was charged a new book price. I will not be buying again from this seller."
3,This book covers almost everything!,"Although there isn't an index entry for Jerry's various tonics and sprays, they're almost all there. As a Master Gardener, I appreciate his informal style, the ready availability of the products he suggests using, and that he doesn't condescend in his choice of plants - this is more than a beginner's book. I have seen gardens enhanced by his methods, and they work!"
4,Nice item nice price,Great Price for Moog parts. The boot is a little frail though. Other than that. great.
2,Laser dies quickly,"The control of PowerPoint is excellet except the blank screen button is often accidentally pressed during the presentation.The laser is very weak and dies often in the middle of a presentation-rather frustrating.I liked the flash memory initially, but found it troublesome because it takes extra time for the PC to recongnize it and a folder always pops up!"
1,Computer crashes,"SMK-Link VP4300 RemotePoint Presenter - Special EditionI have one, it worked beautifully, until my computer started crashing after 30 mins DURING powerpoint presentation, after about more than 1/2 dozen crashes and rebooting computer in midst of a presentation, I decided to not use this particular remote and the computer crashes stopped!"
4,Hilarious lyrics,"First of all, I am not a great fan of country music, which is the only reason this cd only gets 4 stars from me. But otherwise, it is down-home country fun. Catchy tunes, great beat, and lyrics that will have you rolling on the floor. My Baby's got Big Hair is the best!"
2,Out of date,"It's not that it's a bad book, it's not. It was written in the 60's, so you go into this book knowing there's no way you can live on $250 in today's money. It's whole premise is that you live in a trailer park and pocket the savings over a conventional house. He gives trailer parks that Bing Crosby founded as examples. Great, but everyone knows about those parks in CA. and FL. and they are now for multi-millionaires and priced out of sight. There is no way you can live in one for anything remotely affordable. Of course, you can live in other trailer parks, but it's not going to be like living like a retired millionaire. This was probably a really good book in it's time, but it's too out of date to be of much use today."
2,The good and the missing,"Chapter 3 stands out for Whetten's insight into how to make and how to use theory. Chapter 4 is a fine if succinct summary of Huff's ideas on writing as a skill and as a discipline.The rest of the book is humdrum. The book as a whole misses the big picture about the range of skills and methods in management research. There is insufficient attention to research question choice and framing, and to literature reviewing (other than briefly in Whetten's chapter); and a glaring lack of material on quantitative methods and applications.Add this to the - alas long - list of books that confuse qualitative research with management research. This particular book does not even stand out for what it has to say about qualitative research."
5,"Very, very light jazz (but excellent).",I still enjoy listening to this one after 32 years.This album would be a good gift to someone who enjoys music to relax to. Almost every track is happy and up-tempo.
3,Always Opend Minded to Newness,Okay. So... I applaud them for experimenting with my utmost respect. But; I just don't get it.
1,Deceiving picture...,Too bad there wasn't also a simple picture of the sheild. The picture shown is deceiving! It looked as if it fit the whole bowl. I would not have bought it if I knew there was a gap in it. I guess I'll slap some tinfoil over it and make due.
3,pouring shield,The shield's main purpose is to make the KitchenAid mixer look expensive! The ingredients stick to the shield making it harder to scrap into the mixture. I'll use it now to collect the dust from going into the bowl!
3,Kitchenaid,"It doesn't stay put very well, but it does make it easier to add ingredients. I didn't know how to judge the size of my mixer."
4,Just as described.,"I have had this for about a month now. I made sure that it fit my model before I bought it (very important!) The only reason I gave this product 4 out of 5 stars is that there is a space on the shield, which powdery ingredients get out. But since this is the only one that fits I would still buy it again, very useful! Does not fit snugly on the bowl."
5,Copmletes Stand Mixer set up,"Great price for this shield. AAA+++ rating for transaction, delivery and product. Why go anywhere else. Amazon.com has it all."
5,present,my wife always thoght she wanted a food processor but thought they cost too much for the limited use it would get . she uses it all the time and wouldn't be without one now.
3,NOT AS EXPECTED,THE MAIN REASON FOR PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT WAS TO STOP DRY INGREDIENTS FROM FLOWING OUT (NOT). THE FIT IS VERY POOR. POURING IS THE ONLY EASY PART ABOUT THIS PRODUCT.
1,not what I expected,My original shield had two pieces which covered the whole bowl.The kitchenaid knips 1 does not cover the whole bowl. It leaves about a six inch opening which allows escape of dry products during the mixing process
5,It works.,This shield works very well to eliminate spatters and flour dust on other items in my kitchen.
3,Does not perform as expected,I agree with others who complained about the poor fit of the shield to the bowl. The shield flops around unless you hold it in place while adding ingredients and isn't really needed.
5,Mother of a 4 year old,"This is by far the best product from Geo Trax. After an easy assembly, I connected it the tracks and learned how it works. Once the train goes through the Water Works toy, it stops the toy and you watch the water spin upwards in the tower. Once it is all full, you turn the handle on the side and it releases the train to continue. My son LOVES to watch the water fill up and then he pushes the knob down to bring the water back down so it can fil up again. The plus side is that this toy does not require any batteries."
2,"Some parts dont fit, some not included. Poor Manufacturer help.","All the gaskets were of good quality. Didn't include the water-tube gaskets for the pipe from the water pump, to the rear water manifold! Valve cover gaskets were wrong for the application also!! Too bad I didn't notice this until all the other gaskets were installed! Don't even think of calling Fel-Pro for help! They were useless. Had to pay $40 for correct valve cover gaskets from the local store!"
2,Not great,"Those looking for a comprehensive interview prep should look elsewhere. I was disappointed in the lack on content and depth of the material. For reference, this book is no bigger than the PTS Guides ASA prints."
1,Incorrect and incomplete,"HV Morton was born at Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester, nowhere near Birmingham ! This information is widely available free, for example on Wikipedia. The other details given here are scanty to say the least! Even the bibliography is not complete. This product, cheap though it is, is outstandingly bad value for money."
1,Not for digital cable,This device does not work with digital cable. Had to return it and purchased a Belkin unit insted.
3,be careful,"I had to return this item b/c it did not fit the kitchen aid stand mixer that I use. When, I searched for ""kitchenaid 3 Qt mixer"". This is the only product that was found on Amazon's site. When looking at Kitchenaid accessories after I ordered, I found the correct 3 Qt bowl for the stand mixer that I have at home. I now wish I would have read the reviews b/c there is one about this same thing happening to another person. I am sure it is a good product for the right mixer, but be careful in ordering b/c it will not fit the stand tilt head mixers. Live and Learn, I guess."
3,very good interpretation.,"I ca not say that it's one of the best interpretations i've ever heared, but in this record there's one thing very important - the sound, it has a magic like you are listening to it LIVE."
2,eh...,"Don't expect good quality from this budget LaserLight CD. Actually the sound quality is quite poor, especially the last track."
2,good enough,"Don't expect great quality from this budget LaserLight CD. Because it's fast paced, I got this CD to practice swing dancing to."
2,Almost UNWATCHABLE,I cannot believe the quality of this video. This is by far the poorest quality dvd I have ever seen. I can't even compare it to anything. It reminds me of the quality of my camera phone. I like Europe a lot so I had to buy it. Not sure how many times I will watch it - due to the grain like view. Support the band - go buy the new cd. Rent the dvd if you need to see the show! The sound quality is fair at best.I did enjoy the setlist and it was fun to see them play live. That is the only reason I gave it a 2.
1,GREAT BAND - WORTHLESS DVD,"Europe has always been on of my favorite bands and I was really looking forward to this DVD, but I'm so dissapointed!In my opinion, the whole point of a Live-DVD is to bring the magic of a live show into your livingroom! Well this DVD truley fails in doing that. The picture quality is extremly low, the sounds i horrible ( supposedly DTS, but Ive heard better MONO sounds),, and the overal show is nothing but a low production DVD. Don't get me wrong, EUROPE did a great job playing their music on this DVD, but the crew filming it manage to ruin it!I wish Europe would hire the crew that recorded Evergrey's ""A Night To Remember"", because that DVD is amazing!If you're a Europe fan you should have this no matter what. IF you're not a fan you might wanna hang on to your cash and get something better!"
3,Not perfect but worth the price,"Although the book had valuable information on remote areas of Mexico the ""narrative"" approach to giving directions was a little dated in the age of widely available GPS. Distances are often expressed in terms of time and landmarks are at times vague.Even so I have used the book on several trips and found it better than my usual ""inquire locally"" approach. At least I don't feel that I'm going in totally ignorant of a location. The book is particularly valuable in picking a destination to your liking.If you are at all a naturalist you will appreciate the detailed lists of flora and fauna. The general travel information was also quite detailed."
5,This movie is great,this movie is a little girls dream! I loved Nadia ever since I was a little girl my mother tells me i used to pretend i was Nadia when i was 3 years old i loved this movie!! if you child wants to get into a sport almost any sport this brings the struggles and reality that a person has to go through to be the best good movie!!
4,Good ol' Nadia,"My brother and I used to watch this back in the 80's when we too were taking gymnastic lessons. The movie tells a good story of practice makes perfect and would be good for any athlete to see and learn from. Remember though, this movie was made in the 1980's so don't expect much if you've never seen it before!"
1,Too pricy,"Why on earth is this video so much money on here? 300 and something dollars REALLY? I'll spend 15 dollars on the DVD and get all the scenes! I had this on my wish list and the last I checked it was five dollars, I come back and now it costs the price of my monthly car payment.. no thank you!"
3,Decent portrayal,"I felt the movie could've used a little more gymnastics action, and a little more of Nadia's come back from adversity. Also, little Teodora reminds me of another past Romanian star, Alexandra Marinescu."
5,Nadia - Movie,I was very happy with both the movie I received and also how quickly I got it... It was delivered a lot sooner than I had been estimated and I was very impressed...5 stars!!!
3,Interesante,"El problema es que su realización es muy pobre, carece de menu, no trae bonus, ni subtítulos, ni otros idiomas, está hecho a la rápida pero la pelicula es entrañable."
4,"From what I've seen, it's pretty good","I saw a small part of this movie on the Internet, and from what I saw, it was pretty good. I just wish I could see the whole movie!The gymnastic sequences were very well done, although some of the editing was pretty bad.If you can get your hands on this movie, than I think you should see it, because it deserves to be seen."
1,Charged double,I was charged DOUBLE for this product and NO ONE would contact me or offer to pay me back. I am never ordering from here again......
3,tolerable,"Despite some flat acting, this is a tolerable version of the Nadia story, made for TV and aired about the time of the 1984 summer olympics. It's not a documentary; it's a dramatization with actors.There are no extras, though (not even subtitles), for example: what are they doing now? The original 1976 footage, etc. You're getting just the bare movie."
2,unexpected cuts,My daughter loved this movie when she was growing up and knows it by heart. She was very disappointed that some scenes were cut when she showed the movie to her daughter. And they weren't cut very well. The scenes jumped around and were very un-coordinated.
4,Great,I watched this movie many years ago when I was doing gymnastics. I just wished it had a little bit on the end that just told us about what she is doing now.
4,Nadia,"I have shown this movie over the years to students ranging from 2nd to 6th grade. Last year I dropped my old copy and it broke. I thought I was not going to be able to replace it. I am so grateful I found a copy this year. My students have enjoyed watching it and have often asked to borrow it. I love it and will sit and watch it with my students every year. We use this movie to discuss setting goals, working hard and making sacrifices to achieve our goals. This is one of my favorite movies to watch over and over."
4,reccomended by teacher!,My teacher has been telling me and my friends about this movie for a long time.She watched it as a kid several times. Finally I saw it and it was great!
5,The greatest gymnast of all time!!,"I love this movie. I watched this movie in 1985, the same year that Marylou Retton got a perfect ten. I've been looking for this movie for over a decade. It's a great movie and a must see for all gymnastics fans!!!"
5,Five Stars,"Just as good as Han and Leia's journals, Luke's is exactly what I would expect to find in his journal. It was fun re-living A New Hope through Luke's eyes."
2,The Name is EL Salvado,"OK first of all my country's name is ""EL SALVADOR"", why can they get it right, if they want to make a movie about what really happened make sure you get the name right. Second I do not know if the gay gave them the story by detail or not but things where mixed up and the church was not like pyramid, and was not little much less luxurious like they presented there, plus the bullet was in the forehead and was shot from the door of the church not two feet from him. There are many discrepancies in this movie. The reporter or whatever he is, what a shame. And I believe this is a revised or something because I have seen it before and its different to this one."
1,A betrayal to it's namesake,"If you are looking to watch a film to tell you the story of life in Salvador during war times... this is not a good choice. If you are looking for good acting... this is not a good choice. It you are looking to watch a demeaning, distant, ignorant, fake, and lame attmept at teling a story... then this is a film for you.Watch Romero instead."
4,Pretty good,"Decent film that gives a good sense of the violence perpetuated by the U.S. backed death squads (a.k.a. ""freedom fighters"") in El Salvador. This is an early Oliver Stone film and I believe it was nominated for a least one academy award. Like in Missing (about Chile), we get the story of a free-lance journalist. It also incorporates some of the major events of the time (i.e. the assassination of Archbishop Romero and the rape and murder of four American nuns).I don't give it five stars because one does not leave this film with a good undertanding of what was going on. However, as the film sparks the viewer's curosity to find out more, it serves its purpose well."
3,Great movie.......but.,"I very much appreciate the effort by director Oliver Stone, as a matter of fact I myself can relate to some of the situations in the movie, growing up in El Salvador was painful and is perfectly described in the movie as we were always told to respect and obey the orders from ""uniformed"" people. But please explain to me WHY will someone make a movie titled ""El Salvador"" and use mexicans, to me that is an insult. I understand the movie was made in Mexico, but still you should somehow be able to find ""salvadoreans"" to do the little talking that they do, if nothing else ""don't use mexican expressions"" in a salvadorean movie. PLEASE do some research next time."
3,Overall Good Movie About Civil War in El Salvador,"Oliver Stone movie about Civil War in El Salvador in which the United States backed the wrong side and therefore contributed to the misery there. As in his movie 'JFK', he tells a compelling story, but is so eager to dramatize his truth that he doesn't mind telling untruths as well. This damages his credibility, IMHO, but it is not a bad film."
2,"good story, but you'll never stop thinking it is a movie","This is an important story to be told, could have been turned into a great film if in the hands of Spielberg. It is full of stereotypes. They used a lot of Mexican actors and sets. The scenes with the dead corpses are pathetic. The riots look silly, soldiers are scared, looking at the camera like wondering if the film was rolling or making sure their faces were seen. The F word is used excessively. Cathy (Jean Donovan) and Maria, with their teen looks, could be Boyle's daughters. At a bar they sing ""ay ay ay canta y no llores"" this song has been abused by Hollywood in so many films portraying Mexico.The film does deliver the story and no, it is not accurate, but watching a movie (any movie) to learn history, is like drinking water hoping it will taste like wine."
4,central american drama,"a real life look at reporting the news in a war zone.it's pretty much non stop action.i'm a big jim belushi fan,and i was suprised to see him in this type of movie.all the acting was very good.great buy."
5,New Critical Approaches to Contemporary Women's Poetry,"For anyone interested in contemporary women's writing, this collection of essays is a must! In moving across the usual publishing categories that are based around nation, race, and poetic school or grouping (such as Language writing), this volume does not sacrifice an awareness of the cultural specificity of poetic production when exploring the various formal and thematic crosscurrents occurring between poetries being written today. Essays broach a range of issues, including the relationship of gender to authorship, community, and the process of reading. I would recommend this book to any who enjoyed Lynn Keller and Christanne Miller's ""Feminist Measures: Soundings in Poetry and Theory""."
2,Dorsal PF Night Splint,I just keep kicking it off in my sleep - I can't seem to keep it on....it seems to slide while I am sleeping and I wake up with it completely removed from my foot.
2,works so so,"went by the size chart but i think that it is to big, I'm a 10 to 10.5 and i think this is to big to really pull the fore foot and toe to provide a proper stretch for the plantar tendon. it fall off of my foot a night or i've got it so tight to try to get to work that i loose circulation to my foot. get something else."
4,seems to be helping with some heel inserts also,foot is slowly getting better works better with heel inserts in your shoes dr shoals would have had to go to a podiatrist but seems to be slowly healing
3,Freedom night splint,"This product doesn't do the job I was expecting. I can fall asleep with it, which is great, but after about 4 hours I wake up with pain in my little or big toe and have to remove it. I didn't understand the other reviewers that said it gave them pain in their big toe - now I understand. It doesn't seem to have enough bottom support. I'm going to purchase a splint with a flat bottom instead of an elastic band. I use it in the evening if I'm going to be sitting for awhile. It works fine in that situation."
