5,Classic Introductory textbook,This is one of my favorite Electromagnetics books and I don't understand why somebody has not reviewed this book yet for Amazon. It is a well written informative book on one of the more difficult subjects in Electrical Engineering. Excellent book Professor Hayt!
3,FARADAY MEASURED THE CHARGE CAREFULLY,"There are proofs for GAUSS'S LAW, BIOT SAVART LAW and AMPERE'S LAW. The best AMERICAN WAY is to avoid these when they are not understood. The proofs need the conscept of solid angle ,not so easy to understand so avoid it."
4,A great Buffy Book,"This book was a great page turner, and it brought up good issues about racial tension. The summary:An angry chinese gang comes to Sunnydale, thus causing racial tension. The gang is pretty powerful, which Buffy becomes aware of after they attack the bar owner Willy. The story however focus' more on Willow and her new pal Jia Li who is affected by all the persicution towards the Chinese in Sunnydale. Jai Li is traditional, while her brother Lok wants to become more modern and American. He however takes the dangerous approach by means of the Chinese Gang. If you liked the books ""Unnatural Selection"" and the Angel novel ""Redemption"", they are both written by Mel Odom, who wrote this book. I would recommend it if you love Buffy books. It is a nice one to add to your collection."
2,not oar but still okay,"I think they are to close to selling out with this album, what happened to those fun-lovin songs? like crazy game, the wanderer, etc etc . I am sad to see this but I do like this new stuff I just think its not them. I hope they will improve on their next album"
1,Educate yourself,"It's a great argument as to whether or not this is indeed o.a.r. music.....for that argument it is NOT, and they proboly know it.....It's even a greater argument to say that music should evolve....this ISN'T music evolution this is leaving yourself at the door and shaking hands with the devil! When you evolve as a band you don't COMPLETELY CHANGE and furthermore change your music so it fits the current cycle of main-stream CRAP thats played on the radio! Radio music is for those who have no understanding of music but rather understand the same repeating noise that otherwise poisons the ears of those who listen! Good bands dont make the radio PERIOD it's a shame but that's the industry........your either true to what you do as an artist or your another slave to industry driven mind numbing garbage.If it's gold they are after i would hope they realize how phoney the lustre is."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"The album is pretty darn good. There is always the tendency of fans to critique an album on the basis of the band's past. This album adds significantly to the work O.A.R. has produced thus far. It isn't the sound I fell in love with, but I still love O.A.R. This album is kinda like falling for a girl that you continue to love; they are a little different than that magical time in the past but you love them more than ever."
1,huh?,"this sounds nothing like the OAR we've become to know and love. i mean...""love and memories"" might be the queerest song ive heard in my life."
2,What?,"I am just simply shocked. Granted I just bought this CD, however after listening to it I an EXTREMELY skeptical. It's very pop and very mainstream. If any of you have ever heard of Suicide Machines you will know what I mean. They shot themselves in the foot with an album like this but I hope to God O.A.R. does not. O.A.R. is my favorite band and this is not them. Continuing down this path will put them back to playing in the corner bar or broken up completely. The fans are where its at, why disappoint them? More than half of the reviews state the same. PLEASE reconsider your path! This is the first review I have ever written, as I am that disappointed. I am going to see O.A.R. in Denver Oct 21st, 2005 and I really hope I do not hear any of their new stuff. Consider this, one ""mainstream"" album may sell better, however if it puts you out of business was it worth it?"
5,Best yet from OAR,"just got my preorder in the mail, and it is amazing! i had head many of the songs live over the past year. its a nice new edge to their ever evolving sound. every song is a hit! definately pick it up!"
4,O.A.R. is no Stranger to Success,"I cannot get enough of this band. My favorite band and I'm not dissapointed. It's impossible for them to dissapoint me. Another great CD, a little more poppy, but still a great, great CD. If you don't know anything about O.A.R, check out any of their live CD's to get a good idea of the band..""34th and 8th"" or ""Any Time Now"" is a good place to start, CD wise. Download or check out these tracks on SOAS...STANDOUT TRACKS: 52-50, Lay Down, The Stranger, Wonderful Day, Heard the World."
3,Good,"This was good, but I wasn't so crazy about it. I really dig their live recordings better because there seems to be an energy there that's not in this particular c.d."
3,A different band,"This isn't the O.A.R. that I've came to love. The album sounds great, but this is a giant leap from their previous work. I strongly recommend listening to a few songs off the new CD befor making purchase. I doubt this CD will make it into my normal rotation of CDs."
4,Up a creek? How about an O.A.R.?,"Ah, yes, another bad pun. Anyway, although the guys in O.A.R. garnered enough interest through time to move from independent work to a major label, they still may not be the most recognizable band in regards to obscurity. But that doesn't really matter because they still show their skills on Stories of a Stranger.This is another one of those situations where I looked at the one-star reviews and now I'm wondering if those are the kind of reviewers that think one star and five stars are the only options. There are plenty of good songs on here, but my favorites are the first three: ""Heard the World"", ""Love and Memories"" and ""Wonderful Day"". But ""One Shot"" and ""The Stranger"" are also pretty listenable.""Program Director"" and ""Lay Down"" are pretty okay (as is the obligatory end-of-album way-too-long-song ""52-50""), but everything else is fine. Maybe it doesn't sound quite like old O.A.R., but you still shouldn't mind sitting through some stories of a stranger.Anthony Rupert"
4,"Great Band, Good Album","Like a lot of people, I was worried about how the band's sound will progressed. And I admit, I wasn't thrilled at first. But I got over it. I played the CD in my car for a week or so, and ya know what? I don't care who the band is, or what their sound should be, its a damn good CD. It just is.'Love and Memories' is probably going to be huge. And even though it's not 'O.A.R's sound' its okay. Most of the CD is. Is it over produced? I think so. But it could be worse. And if you're looking for the most ""O.A.R."" songs, they are definitely 'Wonderful Day' and 'One Shot'.Also, no one else has mentioned that 'Dakota' is about John Lennon. I mean, seriously people, how has no one written about this yet?"
1,Dissapointing,"This CD is terrible. There is although one good track, Lay down. Otherwise this album sucks. It is completley unoriginal pop music. Oar was influenced wayy too much by stores like hollister and money. This is Honky Music. If you have no taste in music and don't understand it this album is for you. Otherwise Load up on some of their old albums."
1,"Wow, what a let-down...","Radio stations will love this album - serious O.A.R. fans will not! I've been a fan of the band for years and have seen them in concert numerous times. I was a little nervous to hear they were making a more ""polished"" major-label album, and all of my fears were confounded upon listening to ""Stories of A Stranger."" Its sound is very mainstream pop, with hardly any of the jazzy spunk that set O.A.R. apart in the first place. I can only hope that they'll take the response of their fans to heart and return to the more raw sound of their previous albums."
2,What happened?,"i guess when you start working for a major label you automatically lose any creativity you once had. or maybe it was just a short album instead of the live albums i really dig where you actually feel the music flow and the creative side of O.A.R. come out. this is more of a pop album than anything else, not like the band i've come to know. tempted to give it a 1 star, but i couldnt bring myself to do it. its not a bad album, but its not O.A.R. either.in between now and then was a good album that captured most of their feel live and put it on a recorded album. i dont get why they didnt stay with more of that style. bands mature and all that, but this was just not a good growing phase for them. i still have hopes, but i'm not holding my breath for the next album..."
2,What happened to their sound?!?,"I was very disappointed with this album. I remember when I used to hear an amazing amount of emotion in Marc's voice, and they had a unique, edgy style to their music. This album is totally different, and frankly, I don't like it. There is only one song I would listen to over and over again, and that is the first song on the album. A huge disappointment. Also, similar to what some other reviews have said, their live show has gone way down hill. There is no connection with the audience, and their 'jamming' is always the exact same."
3,A Mediocre Album at best...,"OAR is a good band, but this album is less than stellar. The best song is Heard the World, and Love and Memories is pretty good. But other than those two, its just not that good."
1,Not O.A.R.,"If you have been to any O.A.R. concert, or flat out just purchased one of their previous albums you will know that this is not their best album! This album is completely mainstream and extremely ""popish"". The lyrics are great but the beat is not O.A.R.Personally, I think they should have stuck with their last record label Everfine, because Lava is taking them down the wrong path.I recommend any of their previous albums, especially ""Any Time Now"" and their most recent ""34th and 8th"" album. I've been a fan for about 7 years now, and can honestly say that I am really dissapointed in their latest album. Go to their concerts instead!"
3,Makes Me Cry,"This album isn't bad in general. However, I cry every time I hear any of it on the radio - it is a clear sign that OAR has finally sold out, which almost made me cry. I didn't even know it was them the first time I heard Love and Memories. I hope this is a one-time deal and we'll eventually get the old Black Rock and Crazy Game of Poker OAR back."
5,Really good concise history of immigration,"Dinnerstein and Reimers provide an easy to read summyar of American immigration from the conolain immigration to the present. It covers important immigration from Europe, Asia and Mexico such as public reaction, adjusment problems and immigration laws.It provides a great deal information about collective ethnic groups and their positions on domestic and international issues."
3,How can they make immigration history boring?,"I read this book last week for a history class. Supposedly it's THE undergraduate text in immigration history, but I don't really know why. While I admit that it covers an amazing amount of history and information, it lacks organization which makes it very boring and difficult to follow at points. While it's still worth reading for its content, there must be something better out there."
4,Russ's Bus - a bygone era,"well written, easy reading book by a former long haul bus driver. Nice pictures of old time buses. Certainly a book transportation and truck or bus lovers would want to own!"
3,"Looks pretty awesome, but now the paint is flaking","I was so happy when I first got this because it looked awesome in my aquarium. However it's been about 4 months and the red paint on the scull's bandanna is flaking off. My fish try to eat the paint flakes too. Not good. Maybe mine is just defective, I don't know, but buyer beware."
3,go elsewhere...,"actually i am a huge stereolab fan... well i was... whilst i respect them for constantly evolving, they are no longer the band i once loved... whatever... this is a compilation of the first three singles (and i have them all on vinyl!!! start the bidding!!) and really only super electric stands out from the rest, closely followed by it's b-side, 'contact'... if anything this album only serves as a glimpse of how far they've come. if you are shopping for stereolab, whilst quite essential, 'switched on 1' should be at the bottom of your list"
3,kids love it,"My kids - age 6 & 4, absolutely love this cd. I love some of the songs, but the ones sung in a 'bear' or 'moose' voice can be a little annoying. If you are looking for something you can play over & over again, say on a long journey, I'd recommend his cow tunes CD, as the kids love it and it won't drive the adults insane."
5,five star,"This came in very good shape, and the songs are everything, I remembered about them. This is the ulitmate women's anthem."
5,Old Genre - New Twist,"I am not generally a fan of mystery genre but I'll make an enthusiastic exception for this writer! She's got style and panasch... and and she has something to say! Anyone who has lived with the pain, discouragement (not to mention socially acceptable discrimination) of being overweight, or otherwise mildly ""different"" (the ""soft"" minorities), will find special treasures here."
4,Great book,"This was a great book. Usually, I can figure out mystery books, but not this one. It was hard to put down."
3,"All plot, no character development","The story was intricate and intriguing, but the characters seemed present only to advance the plot. I found it difficult to relate to the characters simply because I never really got a chance to know them. I think this author has a lot of potential, and I would read another of her books, but would like to see the next one half again as long, all of it devoted to character development."
1,Missing big time,Never had this happen but the book was missing chapters 6 through 11 and from chapter 5 jumped to chapter 11 through 14 and then started back again at chapter 11 through 31. Something went wrong in publishing!
4,"Imperfections are ""in""","Odelia Grey is the kind of character I would like to have as a friend. She is realistic, bright and unwilling to let a creep get away with murder. Her voice is fluid and witty. It was an especially nice touch to have her enter into an intimate relationship with a paraplegic, both of them considering themselves physically far from perfect and yet able to look past the imperfections in the other person to their true substance. We need more such ""imperfect"" heroes and heroines."
5,Didn't think I liked mysteries...,"I don't usually read mysteries, but came across this book and was intrigued with a book with a plus-sized main character. I could hardly put the book down it was so good! It is written with intelligence and humor. Sue Ann Jaffarian is now one of my favorite authors and I can't wait to read to all of her books!"
1,Very disappointing -- wrong guy,"In terms of content, this is a folk-style album. There will be some who appreciate its straight-forward sound, which doesn't push many boundaries musically or lyrically.I bought this album expecting another work by lyrical genius Steve Taylor (albums from ""Clone"" to ""Squint"", Newsboys producer, witty satire, depth of lyric). When I found the CD on this web site, I thought perhaps the RealAudio on Amazon.com must not have captured the essense of musicality and wit I've come to expect. However, the clips are typical. So those who like what they hear on the clips will probably like this album.My apologies to the man with the same name, but this is not the Steve Taylor of alternative Christian rock fame. I returned this album when I realized I bought it based on its placement in the wrong category."
3,where is steve taylor!,"this is not the most awesome steve taylor i listened to in my teenage years. how could this folk music get mixed up with christian? what do we have to do to get the REAL steve tayor on cd at amazon? i would do anything to be able to get ahold of ""meltdown"" again!"
3,This is not the REAL Steve Taylor!,"This is not the Steve Taylor of Chagall Guevara fame. Also reference Newsboys, Guardian, and several of his own albums for the lyrical genius of the REAL Steve Taylor.( Am I applying this to thick. )Now onto this Steve Taylor of ""Who Pays The Piper?"". Reference the Fugs. This album doesn't have a defining style, but leans to the folk side. I appreciate the lyrical ideas but they didn't come across as strong as they cold have. The music seemed simple and didn't bring the lyrics out. I am not an avid listener of this style of music so my opinion may not be valid. Take it for what it is. Just understand that we all have enjoy different things. I will stick with the REAL thing."
2,Mistaken Identity,"Like the others on this page I was also looking for the _Other_ Steve Taylor. I was bummed that he didnt show up in the search at all.. It turns out that he is a producer now, and runs a little place called squinterland (those of you familiar with the man wont be suprised by the creative name...) You can find him at ...Interestingly enough, Sixpence None the Richer is one of his bands. I agree with the others that it would be great to hear some new material from him, but it looks like he's doing other stuff for a while."
2,"Help me, I'm lost **","I came here looking for a handful of fiesty early 80's ROCK classics by an artist of the same name, dealing with the perceived problems of established Christianity at the time. I'll check back looking for titles such as ""I want to be a Clone"", ""Meltdown"", and ""On the Fritz"".'til then....CU"
1,Meltdown Withdrawel,"I can't fairly review the album, but I must say that I'm in desperate need of the 'Meltdown' album by Steve Taylor. I was pretty disappointed when He didn't even show up under my search."
3,"Mixed bag, but some good stuff","I don't like CD 1 very much; it's too cybertrancey for my tastes, and the songs are all very similar and unoriginal. Despite the fact that I didn't recognize any of the names of the songs, I'll swear I've heard all of them before.CD 2 is much, much better. It's mostly trancey stuff under 130 BPM, though there are a few faster songs. The best tracks are 1, 3, 10, and especially track 8, ""Air,"" by Sinter. The melodies are bittersweet--not quite happy, really, and sad, in a way--and the bass is strong and heavy.The bonus CD, for me, was Psygone's ""Optimystique."" Funny that the other dude who reviewed this box set got a different bonus CD. Anyway, Psygone is good, and so is their album. I would have liked it better if I didn't already own it."
5,Wonderful Minnie.Wonderful memories.,"I listened to this LP back when it came out.I was entranced with Minnie's ethereal voice,and how she was in the background,soaring away with her incredible range.Five octaves,and strong,too.Not screechy or grating like current vocalists who,in my opinion,just scream,with no real control over their meanderings.But not Minnie.She was one in a billion and it is so sad that she was gone so quickly.RC quickly became one of my favorites back then,and to find this CD so many years later is great.A real treasure."
4,"Bandai Hobby EW-01 1/100 High Grade ""Endless Waltz"" Gundam Nataku Model Kit Bandai Hobby EW-01 1/100 High Grade ""Endless Waltz""","all right what we wanted, everything is fine, I hope to buy others, recommend excellent to collect it thank you very much"
5,You'll never fake your way through carols again!!!,"Though the piano music is not useful for me (don't have a piano), I like seeing the acutal words to the Christmas songs, and believe their presentation in the book, with burnished corners and pretty fonts, greatly enhances the product. As for the crafts that go with these traditional songs, they are a joy to behold, and not all that difficult or time consuming to make.Martha's books are by far better a product than her ""By Mail"" or ""Catalogue for Living"" kits, so if you're interested in putting out some money to have beautifully elegant Christmas decorations like her own, go with the book and assemble your own materials."
1,Pass On This One. There are better books.,"Try Carolyn Bell's book, Gooseberry Patch Old-Fashioned Country Christmas: A Holiday Keepsake of Recipes, Traditions, Homemade Gifts, Decorating Ideas & Favorite Childhood by Vickie Hutchins or the wonderful Gooseberry Patch series of books which are delightful. I always love the Gooseberry books."
4,Mastermind - Great Heavy Prog Rock Album,"Mastermind is mainly the project of brothers Bill and Rich Berends. Bill plays a mean guitar and Rich is a very talented drummer. The band's albums are all over the place taking on different styles of progressive rock. ""Tragic Symphony"" covers classic progressive rock territory with a not towards prog metal in spots. Some of this even sounds a bit like Emerson Lake And Palmer although there are no keyboards used. Bill Berends uses a lot of midi guitar that often comes off sounding like keys. It has been a while since I have listened to these guys, and I had kind of forgotten just how much I enjoy them. If you like lightning fast guitar shredding there is much to enjoy here as Bill solos all over ht place. Rich's drumming is top notch as well. The vocal tracks fare a bit less as Bill's voice is ok, but nothing spectacular. This is a very enjoyable album that should appeal to fans of the band."
3,A very sweet replacement,"I bought this cat recently after losing my kitty to the pet food poisoning. When the cat arrived, it was packaged in a plastic bag. Upon opening the bag I noticed a very toxic chemical odor and I've had it ouside the bag for three days now and it still smells toxic. Needless to say, it doesn't allow me to cuddle my kitty due to the smell. I will plan to contact the maker to find out more about this. After 4 days out of the bag it is starting to lose it's odor. The vendor was very quick to respond and replace the cat for another. I think with a few more days in the air and a little freshener, it will be fine. This is a very cuddly cat with very loving eyes. I'm very happy I purchased it."
4,nice piece of furniture,"I really like my piano. It not only sounds nice, but it also is visually much more appealing than similar priced competitors products. The keys feel very nice with the weighting and tactile feedback. The volume is adequate and at the higher settings make it indistinguishable from a stringed piano. Word to the wise though - this baby is NOT light! I thought that if I bought an electric piano it would be more portable. NOT! The delivery service would NOT bring it into my home and it took two strong men using a hand cart to get this bad-boy safely into my home. Some assembly is required. Trust me on this; often when instructions say it is a two man job you can make do solo - this is not the case with this piano. Get ready for some heavy lifting..."
3,Disappointed in conditiion of book,"This book I believe is currently out of print. I was hugely delighted to be able to purchase it.However, it was advertised as 'good condition' if I recall correctly. Actually it is stained on some portion of each page, and the first 50 pages are so heavily underlined, apparently by the previous owner, that it is difficult to read.No, I don't want my money back, but the condition was most disappointing."
5,Excellent service,Received product from seller within three days of placing order. Will definitely order from seller again.
5,mary kay,"wife loves it, heard it may be discontinued and we bought a couple from others to make sure that she has some until finding another product."
5,Pleased with my purchase,This light moisturizer compares to some of the more costly brands in texture. Its a good value at a reasonable price.
1,Red Face,My local Mary Kay representative told me it is illegal to sell Mary Kay products online. I had a horrible reaction to the Extra Emolient Cream and had to go to the hospital. I gave my local Mary Kay representative the serial number on the bottom of the jar and she said the product was over 4 years old. I though I was getting a bargain but it cost me doctor bills and emotional stress. I have been writing since I made the purchase to refund my money but I get no response. I w
1,Not Worth the $,"I purchased this item for a road trip where we were going to be passing through a lot of back roads country, so I was worried that I would not get reception with a wireless receiver/converter. Unfortunately, this item defines the line ""you get what you pay for."" The sound quality is terrible--even with the volume turned up on both my iPod and car stereo, we could barely hear anything."
3,It serves its' purpose...,"It serves its' purpose... there is not much to say about this item. It came, I put it to use, and after two minutes of adjusting to my deck player it worked fine."
2,Cheap!,It is cheap all the way around. The velcro closing the Zune in the case has already come apart after a couple of weeks and my Zune fell out yesterday. Two of the control buttons are covered up by the case - makes it a pain in the neck to use those buttons. Good thing it was cheap (that's the only reason I didn't give it 1 star). In this case you do get what you pay for.
3,A great introduction to checkers,"I have played checkers for over a year now, and I'm quite serious about the game. I was hoping for this hand held checkers game to fine tune my skills and learn some new moves. The game is very easy to play and very easy to hold. For begining play the game is difficult. Yet for anyone that is serious about the game and has been playing for over six months the computer opponent is very easy to beat, but for kids and people wanted to learn the exciting game of checkers it is a must to have. If they come out with another hand held game that is harder to beat, I will have to buy that one."
2,Too weak an opponent,"I played with this in a local store, and beat it quite soundly - and I am *not* a strong checkers player. It might be strong enough to play against a kid, though. And the packaging was definitely nice and compact; contrary to the above review, I had no trouble seeing the screen."
2,Cute but the radio is maddening!,"This box has it all for a very cheap price, but look out if you want to listen to the radio. The dial is imprecise and the display of the frequencies way too small. If you don't care about the radio, well, the looks might get you!"
2,Not a great boombox at any price,"I received this as a Christmas gift and was excited to finally have a CD player that was easily accessable while I worked in the kitchen. The idea was to have something nice, but small. It is small. The sound on mine is horrible! I hardly ever use it because of the speaker quality. Spend a little more. There is nothing worse than listening to your favorite classical piece on speakers that distort the sound! Almost as bad as finernails on a chalk board. . ."
1,Save Your Money!,"This CD player is the worst piece of junk I have ever purchased. It didn't take long for me to find out how badly made it was either. First of all, the radio doesn't pick up radio stations very well. A station that I used to listen to quite clearly on my old $29.99 radio came in very weakly on this one. I've only had the item seven months and the CD player is broken. The antenna always wobbled and looked very cheaply made. As I was adjusting it one day, it bent and then snapped right off!This is the most cheaply made item I've ever bought. I had my old $29.99 radio for over ten years. This item is already falling apart in eight months. Don't buy this item unless you want to waste your money."
2,Not the usual RCA quality,"I am quite disappointed with this stereo, considering most all of my other RCA products have performed well. The sound is OK, but the radio tuner allows the stations to ""fade"", requiring constant retuning. The CD player turntable spins, but will no longer read any CD at all. The ac cord connection is a sloppy fit, allowing the power to disconnect at will. Save your money, buy something else.....this unit appears to suffer from poor build quality throughout."
2,More Promise than Practice,"Maybe it's not a problem of the book itself but of MDA, but the discipline looks still very immature. Or maybe the book fails at providing practical and useful examples. Anyway the book is about 5 years old so things may have progressed meanwhile."
5,Refreshing and unexpected...,"This was fun! I wasn't expecting it.This was not movie I would choose to go watch.We only went to see it, because the kids wanted to go to a movie, and this was the only one that was showing that they could go to (all other kids movies that were showing, we had already seen). This was the only one left, for us to go see, at the local theater.I'm glad it was, and that the kids pressed on.For me, it was refreshing, for once to watch a great non-animated kids movie. I (and the rest of the family) love animations. Disney/Pixar, DreamWorks etc. So Dairy of a Wimpy Kid, would not be something we would normally go for.I have to say, I liked it very much. Lots of laughs. Mom, and the kids (7 and 12) liked it too.Every now and then, I was looking to my right, just to watch our 7 year old luaghing out loud. He had a great time! So did his older sister."
3,Very funny it is good as the book.tks for this.,Funny stuff!! It is great as the book. My daughter has seen do many times lost the count. And she had the book as well.tks
5,Good movie,"Kids loved it, perfect road trip material for watching on the kindle fire. Funny, always a hit with the kids."
4,Great movie,The movie is great. It is awesome for snow day. The characters and plot were funny and made me laugh
4,Cute movie,"My 7 and 9 year old love the Diary of wimpy Kid movies. They are tasteful, clean and funny. Great movie!"
4,fun for kids,My 5 year old son loves these movies. He can't get enough of them and will watch them over and over.
3,Ehhhhh..,"I liked the first, the second one made me laugh out loud (i even rented it several times), but this one just didn't seem to par. It was just ok, I chuckled a few times, but definitely good for kids- even a few lessons to be learned."
3,wimpy,we love diary of wimpy kid as they are usually very funny but this one was so so and not very funny
4,Great Kid's Movie,"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days - I rented this movie for my Grandson on a ""snow day"" He was enjoying it so much, that I sat with him to watch the remainder of this cute movie."
2,The movie was good but only a one day rental,I previously rented another instant amazon movie and it was a 2 day rental. Didn't realize some movies are just a day rental like this one.
3,Picture quality not the best,Loved the movie and so did the family. My lower rating is because we purchased this through our Prime account and tried to watch it on our tv. There was NO HD quality at all it was like watching a VHS movie. However when we watched it on the Kindle Fire the quality was outstanding.So I dont recommend it if you are going to stream it through your TV.
3,Good flick,My kids liked it a lot. Like a whole lot. They really really really really really really really liked it.
2,Mostly dumb humor,"Weak acting and silly antics really in a mediocre comedy, but maybe the kids will still find it funny and entertaining."
2,Wimpy kid is a compulsive liar?,I regret allowing my 8 year old to watch this movie. This movie is base on the kid telling lies on top of lies to get what he wants. Wow!!
3,Not as good as the last one.,The kids are all already too old for their characters. Did not laugh nearly as much as the last. Just okay.
3,whats up lately with Amazon buffering?,The movie was great .. but why is Amazon instant video buffering so much lately?.. since Christmas? We have 30MP down and tested speeds during the video..
4,Great movie,"This movie series is cute and we have all three DVD's. The only downside is the packaging, it is cheap paper like and will not hold up over time."
4,Family Movie Night!,"My kids; nine & ten have read all the books, and this was the only of the movies they had not seen.I would highly recommend this movie for kids of all ages, and as a great family movie night film."
4,Great Movie,I love the series of Diary of a Wimpy Kid. It is a great movie that the grandkids like to watch when they stay overnight.
5,Great Movie,My whole family thought this was a very funny and entertaining movie. It's definitely a kinds film produced for ages 10 and up because my kids actually sit down to watch it this time.
4,funny movie for the entire family,Difficult to find an entertaining movie for the whole family but this fits the bill. Love the series. The angst of adolescence given a humorous twist.
5,Kids loved it!!,I personally haven't watched it but my kids and mother watched it and they all loved it! Would definitely recommend the series.
2,so-so,"I always look for reviews before I watch something. I don't remember who the reviewer was who recommended this, but he was way off the mark"
5,They nailed it!,"Excellent family film! Fun for kids and adults. None stop laughs, my 50 year old husband thought it was hilarious. The kids asked if we could buy it to watch over and over again.I highly recommend it. Good, clean movie. We need more like this one for families."
3,Diary of a Whimpy Kid,Diary of a Wimpy Kid was ok. It may have been more interesting for a child. I am 70 and it was not worth watching for me.
1,"Was Not Able to Play Movie, could not find way to get refunded, experience sucked","Was Not Able to Play Movie, could not find way to get refunded, experience sucked. Very disappointed. Wasted money then rented from Red Box for less money. I will probably rent from Red Box first in the future."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"Be careful when you rent a movie! You HAVE to be connected to Wi-fi to watch it! I REALLY WISH I would have know that! I rented this movie for my son to watch in the car on a road trip but you can't do that! And that makes NO SENSE! When I do library books, it's like a rental, and I don't have to connected to wi-fi to read my books! No more movie rentals for us!"
1,inconvenient to use and no hd,you cant download and burn your own single copy to dvd for use on a dvd player.stuck playing it in low definition on computer. dissatisfied with amazon customer service.
5,Best Wimy Kid movie ever!!!!,"I think that this is one of the best family comedies of the year, Zachary Gordon does a terrific job with the character Greg, a lot of the stunts were copied from some mr. Bean episodes- just saying!Highly reccommended for comedy lovers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Hialrious,"Have not received the DVD yet, but saw it at the movie. It was hilarious. Purchased for my grandson. He loves all these books and movies."
3,"meh, it's run its course","If you've seen the first two movies, this is more of the same. Good clean kid-friendly movie fun. This one does take its time hitting its stride as it's not until the amusement park visit do any solid jokes hit home. Heartwarming in the end so...The extras are a bit light--deleted scenes and bloopers--and the requisite commentary track. Not a big fan of the cartoon artwork of stick-boy wimpy kid in the one full skit on the extra."
4,very funny for viewers of all ages,"This was the best one of the series. It was so clever and laugh out loud funny. Roderick's band, Loaded Diaper, is once again show-cased with hilarious results. This was a kid's movie that you really can let the kids watch without worrying that there might be inappropriate content. Adults can watch and really enjoy it, not just pray for the end, as with some 'kid' movies I've suffered through."
2,"Bad stream, good movie","The first half of the movie kept pausing and skipping. Finally about halfway through, our screen turned blue and we had to unplug the Roku, because that was the only way to get out of the screen. Plugged it back it, picked up where we left off, and the stream was better, but not perfect.The movie itself was good. The kids liked it at least!"
4,Funny,"My 9 year old son thought this movie was funny, he has read all the books. It would be a good movie for kids his age."
3,not as good as the others,"wait until it is on cable, because it is so not funny or captivating as the first couple of movies."
3,Great Kid Fodder,"Rented it for my 7 yr old grandson and I found this offering to be consistent with the Wimpy kid formula, mini morality play with some fun mixed in...7 yr old loved it, of course, and that's the point."
3,Good and fun,"Good movie for the family, OK message, some uncomfortable spots with my kids. Sometimes a little over the top, I would say this is about a dollar movie."
4,Cool movie,Me and my son really liked it. We also thought it was awesome.It was nice cool to see it with real people and not stick figures.
4,"Not bad... Not great, but not bad","I would probably have rated this movie 3 stars, as I just didn't enjoy it as much as the preceding two. However, since my sons really appreciated the humor and had very good things to say about it afterward, I decided to bump it to 4. Good family fun if you liked the preceding two."
2,Good movie but...,Movie was good but amazon instant video kept shutting down. I had to turn off our dvr several times to get movie back. What would have taken 1:37 minutes to watch took over 2 hours.
1,Sound quality was so bad we couldn't even watch it,the sound quality was so bad we couldn't even watch this movie. I ended up having to buy it through my on demand cable instead. what a waste of money!
4,Easy to install air filter,"I received this air filter last night as a replacement for my old filter in a 2007 Honda Civic LX. I'm embarrassed to say that the car is just now hitting it's third birthday and I had never changed my air filter. It should be changed once per year, so now I'm just going to remember to change it out each year at this time.The part was a super easy install. No tools needed at all. Just open the hood, pop off about four small metal clips, open the air box, remove the dirty filter, drop in the new one, and put it back together again. I'd say this job took me no more than five minutes, and that's because I was curious investigating just how dirty my old filter was.The car definitely has a smoother drive as I came to work today."
4,Good Alternative,"This isn't a Honda brand air filter, but it fit my 2007 Honda Civic perfectly for a fraction of the cost of having a mechanic work on it. Do yourself a favor and order this when the time comes, instead of having a mechanic rip you off. Very easy to install."
4,good product,"It was mailed out in time.Good product.Very easy to install, and works wonderful. I highly recommend this air filter."
2,Was not the right filter for my car.,"I would advise you check an independent source to make sure the auto parts you order here actually fit your car. 80% of the items I ordered were correct, but this one was not."
2,boring,"My mother was born in Sweden on a farm neighboring Vilhelm Moberg. I was expecting a different written history than this book and the second volume. I still don't know why Norway and Sweden are one body of land and yet two separate countries with different languages, etc. The book goes on and on about wars and more wars and how the peasants always were the ones to suffer. After a while it all blurred in to a story of wars, just with different characters."
3,bodyboard,for the price I expected better quality. The size is perfect for teens and the boards are colorful. Only average quality at best.Covering material split at sides after only a few uses and moisture gets inside. Only held up for one summer's use. Would not buy this brand again.
2,list of songs,"what about the rest of the songs in the movie??does anyone have the list of songs from teh movie? im looking for one in particular, the one which plays during he scene where he buys out the hotel for the fake hoto shoot.. its a lounge-ish kind of song"
2,ACT Taker,"I would not recommend this book because it is just not that helpful. First, Peterson's is no great test prep company. There is a reason they aren't known for their test prep. The book is very basic and might raise your score from an 18 to a 20, but it won't raise it from a 32 to a 34. The book is great if you aren't even breaking the mean, but if you're aiming for a top score, look somewhere else. Private tutoring perhaps? The Kaplan book is pretty bad too - sadly enough."
5,Cory's review,Dinosaurs Before DarkThe Knight At DawnMummies In The MorningPirates Past NoonTHESE BOOKS ARE THE BOMB BECAUSE I LIKE JACK AND ANNIE. THE ADVENTURES START IN THE TREE HOUSE. THE TREE HOUSE WAS FILLED WITH BOOKS. THE BOOKS TAKE THEM ON ADVENTURES.
5,Magic Tree House Books 1-4,I bought this set on tape for my son's 6th birthday so we could listen to them in the car while travelling. The stories are well-done and made him use his imagination. We enjoyed trying guessing what dinosaurs were being described and he wondered if the kids could see the moon and stars while they were in the castle. Even my 3-year-old had a good time listening. They can't wait to go on another trip to hear more of the stories.
5,Collectible Costume Jewelry: Identification and Values,My sister collects this kind of jewelry gave to her for her birthday she is really enjoying looking up her Eisenberg
5,A MUST book! You should READ AND look at the pretty pics!,"This is a FABULOUS book! I only wish I had this for all categories of my collectables. Not only does she have WONDERFUL color pictures of ALL different types of costume jewelry, enabling you to see other pieces similar to yours; but she does an excellent job CLARIFYING terms ie BAKELITE vs CELLULOID vs PLASTIC! She even includes diagrams & terminology of stone cuts & facets, pearl lengths & styles and jewelry designs. PLUS there are diagrams of ""signature"" markings.There is also a section on ""Watch Outs"" for FRAUDULENT copies. As a novice collector, I found this to be just what I need to be knowledgable and also to alert me when sellers don't know what they're talking about. This is a book you want to READ AND LOOK at the pretty pictures."
2,"Nice Photography, But of Limited Value","Simonds has put together a nice collection of photographs of a variety of 20th century costume jewelry. However, future buyers should understand that the book is limited in its scope: 1920s to the recent past - focusing primarily on 40s to 60s items. Other problems with the book: very little on Bakelite & Lucite, an obsession with ornate 50s faux precious stone pieces, and failure to connect manufacturer/designer with their mark or signature. It was frustrating to go through 5 pages of designer identification prose at the front of the book only to find the related graphics stuck in an Appendix at the end of the book with NO indication as to who belonged with which mark.In all, its a book best suited for beginning collectors of rhinestone and similar types of jewelry, not for someone attempting to do serious research. It was a waste of my money."
3,This book was not what I hoped it would be....,"I am new to collecting costume jewelry so I bought this book thinking it would help me identify older pieces. It confused me more than anything else.This book has beautiful photos which have been very helpful to me. However, the author is vague on alot of things.She does talk about the differnt era's of jewelry (i.e. victorian, art deco etc.) but she is not clear on how to date them or how to tell when they were made. Just not enough information or details if you really want to idetify your great finds!I still don't know how to tell the difference between Bakelite, celluloid, lucite or regular plastic!Great book if you just want alot of pretty pictures!!"
2,The Great Syrian Revolt and the Rise of Arab Nationalism.,"An understanding of the late Ottoman period, the First World War, and the War's aftermath is essential to understanding the modern Middle East. This is a good, accessable step in that direction. It should be mentioned that there were also revolts in the same general time frame against a similar British occupation in Iraq. And the informed reader will also see parallels with the present conflict in Iraq.A book worth buying-Cleve Shearer"
3,many typos and mistakes,"This book is well written. Detail explanation is given for derivation step by step. There is space in the pages to take notes for your understandings.There has been good discussions in previous reviews. I add some more aspects.I went through all the pages and detected many typos and mistakes. Some are difficult to find such as page 210 and 288.The book is self contained and will be good practice. However, I suggest to have someone to work on this book together. It may be just due to a typo even if you don't follow a context."
3,Decent,"It was a pretty good movie, not better than 1st. It was a more hip version of the original Center Stage."
3,You have to love dance movies.,"I really like this Movie but,I also watch every dance movie I can get my hands on, so basically I am bias. It's not my favorite, but I find it entertaining and the dancing is pretty good. I am glad I own it! Don't expect great acting and story. But if you love to watch dance movies, this is a movie for you! Hope this was helpful!"
5,Center stage,I ordered this DVD which I received in record time. I had watched this movie first one rental and fell in love with it and just had to have it.
4,Wonderfully entertaining,"This movie is cleaner than its predecessor and much lighter, too. The dancing makes you want to get off the couch and the story is sweet enough to make you smile."
5,Great movie!,I loved this movie! I know part of it (her ballet training) may not be completely realistic but the movie is so good. It's different in a good way from the first Center Stage.
5,good quality great design!,"I bought this for my two year old. she loves it! she plays ponys in it, and dolls. its helping her learn social skills, and gives her a good space to be messy. its all wooden, the windows are plastic and pop out. the doors are sturdy and open and close. i had a hard time putting it together, though i think someone that isnt lame at this sort of thing might have had an easier time of it. over all i love it and cant think of any faults."
2,True to title,"With jangly strings and other assorted sloppy globs of dread supplementing sprawling nerdish alt-country simplicities, the unspectacular album's sound is reminiscent of a dim-witted ASMZ and YLT offspring."
2,Not Dishwasher Safe,"The main problem I see with these trays is that they deform when run through a diswasher on normal cycle. A second issue for me is that the volumes of the different figures are uneven, so you don't get evenly sized pieces if using this for a candy mold."
2,Way Too Small. Not Very Useful. Expensive.,"Sorry! I wanted to love it. It's very cute, but it's tiny. It may be good for a couple of kids cups, but that's the best you can hope for. Even then, it's not worth the cost. It looks great in the box, it just doesn't work well in real life."
4,"Works fine, some people are just stupid","I'm sorry but a couple of the people reviewing here are just plain idiots. I am referring to all of the reviews that claim that the color game does not work. The instructions -you know, that big sheet of paper that comes in the box??? - clearly tell you that you have to HOLD the last button down until you hit the next one!!! When you follow the frigging instructions it works just fine. It's also a bit more of a challenging game for the child because a little bit of coordination is required. At any rate I think that people who rate a product down because they are too brainless to read the included instructions should just stop posting reviews altogether."
5,Great memories,This is one of the greatest album of argentinean rock ever recorded. It still sounds fresh and makes you dance in any ocassion.
1,Look for the humor in a negative situation,"""Look for the humor in a negative situation"" - page 33 in this book.I can't believe I paid $10.95 for this bs. Ha-ha-ha.The person laughing, however, is the author - Harold R. McAlindon."
1,"Menos 5, de ser posible","Por favor... cinco estrellas a una chica de ""17"" años (en cada arruga), totalmente prefabricada, con música de los mas cursi y gastada?"
2,por favor..fey?,"ok, tal vez tiene unas canciones super pegajosas..quien se olvida de ""mi media naranja""? pero la verdad es que todavia (despues de 3 discos) le fatla mucha voz. más bien, no tiene voz. Es una lastima que con tan poca voz se ha logrado tanto exito."
4,"I Don't Speak Spanish, but I like this album","I had a cool spanish teacher in high school that introduced the class to spanish rock and pop music. It helped me get into it and I enjoyed the music itself, even if I didn't understand the message."
2,New Beginnings show end of Heartland,"New Beginnings is book that is a repeat of past heartland books. Since #8 Heartland book (Thicker than Water)the series has lost interest in me. Someone always has an issue, and it becomes solved by Amy. No one else. And the issue is always revoled around a horse. In the end there is some sort of join up, and the story ends happily.Another issue I have with these books is that they do not grow with the reader, I started reading these books at age 11, now I am 15. There needs to be more drastic events (or at least one) within the characters. There needs to be something more exciting (Mystery, Romance, or Action). Overall New Beginnings is unthrilling, and a repeat of past books. Readers should only read this book if you are young and starting off with chapter books."
5,"One of my fastest reads. A funny, poignant page-turner.","Alternating between funny, sad, witty, light and dark (and sometimes all at once), the one constant that keeps the story moving and compelling is the author's total sincerity. The character of Maria is very accessible because of this, and it is hard not to laugh or cry with her.The author's evident wit and intelligence make the pages turn very quickly, and as the end of the story approaches you can't help but wonder how Maria will fare.While many may get this to read tales from ""inside the industry"" (and there are some great moments), the story's best asset is its universality. We all have goals, dreams and ambitions. Watching Maria come to grips with hers helps us do the same."
5,I agree with Dale!,"Goanna were probably the best of the Aussie Invasion that hit the US back in the early '80's. I bought an audio cassette of Spirit of Place in 1982 and it quickly became my favorite tape ever. There aren't any songs on this cd, tape, whatever. They are, instead, well-crafted, intense stories set to music. If you like the works of Harry Chapin, or Springsteen's ""Nebraska,"" you might want to give Spirit of Place a moment of your time. You won't regret it!"
3,"Good story, but confusing","I did like the story, the actual plot of the book, but it was difficult to really tell what the book was about until nearly the end of the book. Throughout most of the story it is just flashes, similar to character building, but not really character building. I agreed with a different review on here that the author changes from page to page. Though the main character is the boy, the author doesn't really stick to one main character or main thought process.Like I said, it was a good story, but confusing as to what it was actually about until about 3/4 into it."
3,Not bad for an introduction,"This book was a thorough history into the British Special Air Service's exploits. It has a lot of information on contemporary SAS operations not usually covered in other books or media; specifically, operations in Sierra Leone and the Balkans. I learned some new facts (which always sets a book apart from others) about the Falklands campaign. The book has a lot of good detail (tactics and strategies) on various operations that I have not seen in other SAS books. The author has a hard time figuring out whether the Royal Marines SBS is the Special Boat Service, Section, or Squadron. That oversight, as well as punctuation and grammatical errors that were blatant throughout this book, required that I rate it 3-stars. I nonetheless recommend this book as a very entertaining and informative piece of literature."
2,Cool Dead People review,"I did not like this book. ALTHOUGH I did ""meet"" some interesting deceased people it gave nothing on how they died or what became of the people they inflenced. It would have been GREAT with a bit more research from the author."
4,Live at Froggy's,"This is the LIVE AT FROGGY'S recording (Dover, Delaware, May 2001). A trademark of the ""Extended Versions"" series is that they generally cut a few tracks from the original versions of live releases; but not having heard the original (it's not even listed on Amazon-?), I can't say if that's the case here. At 50:59, it's a reasonably long album.The band throws several covers into this performance -- Nazareth (""Hair of the Dog""), John Fogerty (""Sweet Hitchhiker""), Slade (""Gudbuy T'Jane"") and Kiss (""Shout It Out Loud"") -- but the standouts are their own material: good renditions of ""Long Way To Love"", ""Dream On"", ""Girlschool"", and the 3-song medley that concludes with ""Gudbuy"".For some reason Tommy Paris' voice doesn't sound as strong on this recording as on the studio releases and the band's earlier live album-- but this is a decent bout of rocking anyway."
2,English Bungling Ignored--as usual,"Mr. Stanley treads lightly on the English generals who bungled this campaign. Did it really matter whether the New Zealanders kept Quinn's Post more tidy than the Aussie's?? Churchill, Kitchener, and Hamilton got thousands of good men killed for nothing. Stanley must be hoping for an English edition later."
4,"Art plus fire -- creative, exciting, & child-friendly","I bought this for my 6-yr old boy's birthday. After a few minutes of my explaining the basic concept (wrap the wax around the wick) he quickly made several really neat candles. I have two other boys, 7-1/2 & 9, who loved it, and I'm planning to buy more. They all had so many ideas of how to make the candles--combines art with fire -- great combination! The candles burn clean and have a pleasant smell.However, I'd love to find a cheaper source of colored beeswax. I can see this being a continuous source of enjoyment, and a great Bday present for other kids.I don't recall learning much about bees from this kit, but I didn't read the couple of scraps of paper very thoroughly."
4,Easy to make candles,A great project for kids--especially if studying colonial history to get an idea what candles were made from and how beeswax burned
2,Very hard to do for a 5 yr old,We purchased this for our 5 yr old daughter for christams. It was not easy for her to do. The wax was not easy to use...and did not stick together very well at all. I would not recomed it at all!!
2,Bad copy,"Please do not use the name Night Sky Murals in your ads! Night Sky Murals is not related to your company and as such, you should not use our name in your marketing, as so many other similar companies try to do. For the real Night Sky Murals product, please visit NightSkyMurals.comYour product seems to be nice enough. Why not focus on talking it up and explaining it, without having to use the Night Sky Murals name?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Interdimensional search silliness.The Myth gang, in this, the fifth book of the series are now working out of the Bazaar of the Dimensions. Thanks to the Deveels Aahz goes looking for someone in another dimension, and doesn't reappear. Guess who has to go find him? Where he actually is means the usual things that Skeeve can rely on aren't going to work for him, so more fun and games to be had."
5,Gettysburg: A Testing of Courage,An excellant and absorbing treatment of the Battle of Gettysburg. It lives up to its promise to take a fresh look at a historical event that has been written about numerous times. The author very clearly used new source material which gives him the ability to challenge previously accepted facts and give the reader refreshing new anecdotes from the battle's participants. The maps and timelines are particularly good at clarifying the events concerning the Railroad Cut and the Wheatfield. I would recommend this book to any reader regardless of his or her previous knowledge concerning the battle.
4,A Unique Description of an Oft Described Event,"Trudeau's ""Gettysburg"" adds more mortar to the cement that binds all Civil War enthusiasts together. Having read many many other Gettysburg books over the past four decades, I found this attempt to be refreshingly interesting, well-researched and informative. Some of his statements fly in the face of convention and gave me pause, however the overall product is excellent and enjoyable. The maps are good and understandable, especially if one has read extensively about the battle. He picks no favorites and is objective for both antagonists. His background stories of major and minor players in this battle bring it to life and keep his narrative flowing and enjoyable. I recommend ""Gettysburg"" to all buffs as well as to those starting out on their hobby."
3,Keep Up With Sources,"In 1996 I published an 1872 account of the 1st Vermont Cavalry in the Gettysburg Campaign in ""Gettysburg Magazine"" and in 2000 published H. K. Ide's regimental history. I turned to Trudeau's account of Farnsworth's Charge to see what he had to say. Not only had he overlooked these sources (of course hurting my ego) but he got the details of the operation wrong (hurting the reader.) Even though he has attempted to include most modern sources I still prefer Coddington's study of the campaign and the several books by Harry Pfanz. The Battle of Gettysburg has spawned a cottage industry of books and this is a good one, but hardly the best one or the ""last word."""
3,Not for the Novice,"A bewildering blizzard of names and oddly drawn maps make this no primer for understanding the Battle of Gettysburg. I'll just put this tremendously researched, detailed and authoritatively written tome aside and start somewhere else for an introduction."
4,Interesting and informative book.....,"I have never read a Civil War book that wasn't a novel, so I was originally apprehensive about buying this book. As it turns out, this book is well written, and for the most part, easy to read.The many different quotes and viewpoints helped in giving a better idea of what the battle was all about.The only real negative is the maps. They are generally too small and many times difficult to read. I don't know if the fault belongs to the author or the publisher, but with today's technology, I would have expected better maps.Don't hesitate to buy this book if you are a Civil War novice, as I am. It is well worth the cost."
2,Tough one to finish,"Trudeau's writing style is very hard to follow. The book reminded me of the play by play of a football game...but with no color commentary. The historical context of events is not developed so you are left confused and frustrated. I guess Trudeau assumes that the reader is already quite familiar with the main characters and outcome of the battle, and what he is offering is new detail and analysis for those who have read other the other major works on Gettysburg. I could not get a handle on the events because just as some clarity seemed to surface, Trudeau jumped to another series of events and location. Back and forth, up and down, North and South, East and West... it was very hard to understand. The tiny maps were an additional annoyance, and often did not show the names of the participants mentioned in the preceding text. The book was heavily researched, but not particularly coherent."
1,I am SO glad I checked this out of the library!,"I have read many, many books on Gettysburg and have attended seminars and classes on the subject. I found this book to be poorly edited and nearly incoherent. Trudeau misquoted Lincoln and got Franz Sigel's name wrong. The maps made my head spin. Buy Pfanz & Coddington and don't waste your money on this book."
4,Excellent Single Volume Work,"I'm glad to see some positive reviews for Noah Trudeau's work. I judge the maps to be far more helpful than those found (or not found!) in so many books. The reader will even find Lowe's ""Balloon Surveillance"" on one-a nice touch. Cavalry gets the best coverage I've run across and a lot is explained about this branch of the army: what Stuart was attempting and avoiding, whether Lee was really ""blind"" without him, how prisoners really slowed Stuart down, etc. A must read if only to understand how cav did influence the outcome. I don't claim this replaces Pfanz & Coddington but is much easier to digest, especially the big picture so often lost in the details. [Originally posted March 29, 2004; deleted due to account problem.]"
1,Snags easily,The quality of these towels is not very good. They snag incredibly easily so begin to fall apart after just one use. The good side is they are inexpensive - but you get what you pay for.
2,Elizabeth Peters is better than this,I loved every Elizabeth Peters book I had ever read until this one. She is one of my favorite authors and I am a huge King Arthur fan. My expectations were high. The book was horrible. The plot was loose and the writing was like a bad romance novel. The only good parts were the descriptions of the towns and sights in the Enlgish countryside. From the copywrite this must be one of Ms. Peters early books. She should be ashamed to leave it in print. This is the only book that I ever bought that was so disapointing that it made me angry that I had spent money on it. (For some reason following this review it says it is for the audio version of th book only. I have never listened to the audio version. This is referencing the actual written book.)
3,"Good story, but kind of disappointing","Since this book was written in the late 1960's, I guess the heroine was still in the process of becoming the strong female character typical of Peter's work. This book disappointed me and I couldn't stand the passive heroine at times. In fact, once I set the book down in disgust at her behavior, although that may seem like an overreaction to some people. It seemed like she was always submitting to the ""hero."" Aaargh! However, for those of you that aren't as sensitive about these issues as I am, it's a great, funny tale to curl up in front of the fireplace with. It's also a tie-in with one of Peter's other series, the Vicky Bliss mysteries (which I love), giving some background to the elusive ""Sir John's"" origins."
3,A Good Walk Down Memory Lane,"I first read this book almost 30 years ago. It was the first Elizabeth Peters book that I had read. It made a big impression on me at the time, and I thought it was wonderful, to the point of going back several times to the library to check it out. Some lines stayed with me over the years... ""when she blows, a typhoon; when she bleeds, the red sea""; and, the line about being a ""Tolkien illiterate"". Now, in re-reading the book, I find that it is not one of Ms. Peters' best. I did find, however, that I understood the Arthurian references much more clearly. I am glad to finally have been given a chance to read it again, and to have been able to add it to my collection."
3,"Non-stop fun, but...","I have to put my two-cents in on the question of the heroine's qualities. I happened to read this book at the same time as Mary Stewart's ""The Gabriel Hounds"" (both books written in the late 60's) and I found the heroines curiously similar. There can be no doubt about their courage, but they both appeared to be somewhat mentally deficient in comparison with their male counterparts. In both books, the boyfriends seem to figure things out on their own and withhold the information from the girlfriends, who only slowly and painfully begin to understand what's going on.The technique tends to keep the reader in a bit more suspense, but, as a male reader with a lot of experience in reading suspense stories with female protagonists, I found myself rather irritated that the heroines both seemed to be so dim-witted.Given a heroine who made more of a contribution to the solution of the mystery, this book would easily have been at least four stars for me."
3,can't see where tip meets cue,Not easy to center tip on cue. But if you can center tip by hand does good job of holding tip in place.
3,Porper Tip Clamp,Looks like metal - not! Cheap plastic. Works OK on 11mm and 12mm tips but 13mm tips and ferrules will not fit.... The description NEEDS TO INCLUDE THE DETAILS I MENTIONED!!
3,"Fancy Drinks, but not very practical",Do yourself a favor and pass buy this book if you are a professional bartender. I wasted my money on this book in hopes of serving up some new and different drinks. Most drinks were not practical to make because they contain unusual and expensive ingredients. I feel it's more of a special occasion book and it ends up collecting more dust then actual use.
4,"Interesting book, but look out for bloopers.","Mr. Weinstein suggests serving a ""Port in a Storm"" (p. 174), a hot drink, on Father's Day. A hot drink in June? mmm... He also suggests serving the ""Lemon Cheesecake Thick Shake"" at a baby shower. With all due respect, Mr. Weinstein, ladies' parties generally feature chicken salad, diet soda, salad, and salad, and maybe a dessert. Most women wouldn't be caught dead drinking a milkshake in front of another woman. Although the drink suggestion for each type of party is a nice idea, I would find the drinks cumbersome to make, since most of the recipes serve one or two people. For a group, a punchbowl or pitcher recipe would work better.I appreciate the G-rated drink names--Mr. Weinstein doesn't try to be cute like other cocktail book writers. I also appreciate his grouping of drinks, such as the grouping of hot drinks--coffee, hot chocolate, tea, juice. The cover photos are beautiful--I wish that there were more photos throughout the book."
5,A special Dignity and an Unfailing Beauty of Voice.,"This set offers four generously-filled CDs comprising almost 140 Spanish songs from Victoria de los Angeles' repertoire. To all of them she brings a special dignity and an unfailing beauty of voice. The earliest recordings date from 1950 and the last is the items she sang at the opening of the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. Yes, you will find the ubiquitous ""Clavelitos!"" here, and a later version of ""La maya el ruisenor"" from ""Goyescas"". The enclosed booklet provides illuminating notes by Lionel Salter, who also translated many of the texts which are also included. Accompanists include Gerald Moore and Alicia de Larrocha, and Victoria de Los Angeles provides a guitar accompaniment herself in one song. The last track of all, a zapateado from a zarzuela, recorded live in New York, must almost have brought the house down."
4,A very good book,"This is a very good book and the companion CD-Rom is really very helpful.Did not give 5 stars though because the Cd-Rom could have been made more friendly to navigate (maybe including a ""play all"" option) and should allow us to view the presentations in full screen and not limited to a very small image."
5,Excellent Reference book and CD-ROM,"This is a thoroughly user friendly book for the student of massage, and the best general reference book on massage that I've found. The book attempts to cover it all and does a fairly good job. Particularly good is its section on Western Massage Techniques, especially those demonstrated in the video. The chapter and section in the video on trigger points and their release are particularly helpful for athletes."
3,Tappan Massage book,"This is a textbook and does not explain the procedures/protocol I was expecting for lymphatic drainage massage. It only gave a brief description and some pictures. I needed more detail information. Wish I could have gotten this book from the local library, but someone stole it."
5,SO VERY HAPPY,"with this purchase. Great quality, such a fair price,amazing fast service. I almost can not believe I am so happy with may beautiful new wallet. It far exceeded my expectations. I love it so much I just ordered a spare in another color. Anne from Austin, Tx"
5,Nice purse,"Good quality, acceptable price. However the brown color is a bit older than the one on the picture. I suggest red or light green ones for young ladies."
5,Love this wallet!,"I am always very nervous about purchasing items like this sight unseen. I usually like to check them out ""up front and personal"". I relied on the reviews and am very glad that I did. This wallet feels wonderful to the touch and it is very roomy and well-designed in addition. Shipping was fast and the item was nicely packaged. Good purchase!"
3,OK I guess,"I ordered the apple green, and got the product as pictured. It's ok. The leather was scuffed up a little, had some dirty spots. I buffed it up with some leather cleaner/conditioner and it's fine now. Shouldn't have to do that with a brand new wallet though. It doesn't really have anywhere to put cash. You can tuck it where the checkbook holder goes (I tossed that first thing, who carries a checkbook anymore?) or in the change part on one half since it is divided. But it's really tight, no way to actually look through your cash while it's in the wallet. Hopefully it stretches out a little."
1,It lasted 6 months,"I'm so disappointed in this wallet. I really like the design and the material but it's cheaply made, which I didn't realize until the coin purse completely separated from the rest of the wallet, spilling change all over. This happened after only 6 months of use. I expect a lot more time out of a wallet than that. The design of the wallet is good so I'm very disappointed."
1,Can't recommend,"Wallet is fine except the clasp for the change or bills pocket, whichever you want it for will not stay closed. I use it for ""paper money"" (I don't have a lot) but it will not stay closed, cannot be carefully bent as it will break according to a jeweler friend of mine."
4,Good Wallet,"This wallet is a good size and has lots of card slots. There is room for everything and it stays compact. The only thing I did not like was the checkbook cover was part of the wallet, not removable as the description said. I wanted to be able to keep the checkbook separate. But I like the wallet so I kept it and enjoy using it."
5,nice wallet,"It is a a good wallet at this price, even PU wallet need over $10, so I choose this one. No surprise, no disappoint."
4,Great wallet,"Love the wallet. The only thing that I would personally want different is a zipper change compartment instead, but the change compartment stays closed and has a ton of room."
3,It's ok,"It's mostly what I wanted, plenty of interior pockets for credit and similar size cards, full size dollar bill slot. But, the change purse attachment could really be replaced, or changed, or....something. Mine barely stays closed any more, even with a little change in it, so I don't bother using that part now."
3,Different from pictured!,"Like another review here, the item I got is different from pictured. The differences are not to my favor either.I purchased the black color.Differences:The closing flap is rounded in the picture, while mine is squared.Mine is missing an extra length-wise slot above the card slots.Missing 3 card slots, so I got 7 while the picture shows 10.Missing a row of card slots under the checkbook slot. So I got 3 rows while the picture shows 4.Looking at the differences, I would've liked to have the one pictured more. Mine ended up looking a tad barren.It's still a very nice quality wallet, but I'm left feeling more to be desired.Mine was sold by ""Howie Ventures Inc,"" who seems to be an alias of ""SilverHooks, Inc."" based on the seller details, so I don't now what other versions the other stores might be selling, but there seems to be different versions of the product in circulation."
4,Everything fits!,"Everything fits in this wallet - coins, cash, check book, credit cards, appointment reminders, pictures. It is durable & easy to use as well."
5,Love it!,"In an effort to start saving up money, I decided to stop buying fancy ""name"" brand purses and wallets. So, when my beloved Kate Spade wallet wore out, I turned to amazon. My main requirement was that the wallet looked classy and was all leather. This wallet filled those requirements nicely! I love it. It is a nice supple leather and the cc slots are also leather (a lot of other wallets make those cloth/nylon). I am thrilled with my wallet and I can't believe I used to spend over $200 for wallets when this one is the same quality (or better). I'm a fan of this brand now!"
2,Dissapointed,"This was not as described, I spent a lot of money and had to pay a further 21 custom charge for delivery to the UK, I ordered two of these as I had previously bought some when visiting the states and loved it. One of them is totally as described and is brilliant, the other has less card and note slots than pictured.Product is still very useable and better than your average purse but dissapointed that after spending so much money it isn't what I thoughtI am in the process of emailing supplier directly regarding this"
1,Coin purse does not stay closed!,"I asked for this as a Christmas gift and will already be replacing it, because the clasp on the coin purse does not stay closed. I just have to look at it the wrong way and it pops open, spilling coins into my purse. The slots for credit cards open to the left, so if you are right handed you have to turn the wallet upside down to slide them out...another huge problem. It is cute, nice leather, but totally useless!"
3,It's diferent from pictured,"I got different item, what I ordered. The item, what I got is another (http://www.amazon.com/Mundi-Genuine-Leather-Checkbook-Wallet/dp/B004EWDA2A/ref=sr_1_13?s=shoes&ie=UTF8&qid=1348504350&sr=1-13). Interior is different and price is different!!! I'm very disappointed!"
3,Its not very expandable,"For a wallet that contains a checkbook, it is rather tight. No room for it to expand much. I put 6 cards in the slots in front of the pocket with the snap closure, which does not fill all the slots. It makes it quite thick and bulky, and does not leave much room for the checkbook. With it closed and a full pack of checks in it, my checks end up curved slightly. My current wallet is a checkbook wallet and this does not happen with it, and it also holds the 6 cards in an upright position, and has a snap change pocket. Unfortunately my old wallet is wearing out after many years.I like the green color, but for me this wallet is not a keeper."
5,el mejor batido del mercado,"no existe en el mercado hoy dia ningunproducto con el sabor, calidad y energiaque pueda sobrepasar la calidad deesta proteina, aquellos que puedensobrepasarlo son muy caros.este es la mejor compra hoy dia,crealo, soy una persona muy exigenteal momento de opinar sobre un producto,buena suerte"
1,absolutely useless book,"Maybe my expectations were not set accurately, but I wasn't looking for a touchey feely book that simply repeated the same silly message for 161 plus pages. waste of money and time.. now I am going to have to rush and play catch up with all the work I missed while spending quality time to read this dribble."
4,"Excellent, like water on ice in the sun","Zagajewski is an amazing talent, with the ability to paint pictures--images, not representations--both warm and cold, painful but filled with loving insight. This is a poet who knows the limit experience, but can speak of it like he was sitting at your kitchen table over taboule and coffee. A wonderful gift of words to the world."
5,Creative and Beautiful Works,This book is filled with beautifully written short stories that will blow your mind away. Not like what I have read before. A must have.
5,Excellent Book,I got this book used because it's a pretty penny. Now that I have in hand I think it would have been worth the cover price. It's a lovely book and it's a important read. As a living historian who portrays James Madison I believe the information in this book is amazingly important. As an American who believes we can only understand our Constitution by first understanding it's authors I believe that the writting of Madison are our starting point!
4,Great price for those on a budget,I got my vest in record time. I like the look of it very much but the Buttons could be of better Quality. They are very CHEAP and will break easily and you cannot resew them on the vest.I ordered 4 more before this one and the buttons are of the same poor quality. I was hoping that his one would have better buttons since it was originally priced more than the first four.I would not buy any more from them.
2,Cheap in all ways,"Cheap fabric, very shiny, ill-fitting. The only plus of this product was the price. I wound up giving it to a a friend as part of a gaudy halloween costume. Don't waste your money. Spend a little more and get something nicer."
3,Tuxedo Vest,"The price was right, the delivery was quick, but the tuxedo vest was not quite the quality I expected. I guess you get what you pay for. Should have paid a little more !"
3,Product was great,The product was exactly what I wanted and everything was conducted in a timely manner.
3,"Looks good, but is poorly put together.","The vest and tie are both made out of a shiny material that look awesome and sticks out, even against a black shirt underneath. I've had two problems with this vest. One is that the strap on the back is useless. Two was that most, if not all, of the buttons have come off at one point. If you don't mind sewing buttons back on, then this vest is a great deal, but if you don't want to deal with the hassle, then spend some extra money on a vest that's put together better."
2,I did not get what I wanted,"I wear 2XL sized clothes, so to be safe I figured a 3xl would be loose and comfortable. I got the vest and oI buttoned it up. It was a bit snug, but thought nothing of it until I sat down and buttons shot across the room. I was embarrassed and unhappy. If I knew how to send this back for a refund I would. The reason it's two stars is I like the tie, but the tie is not worth the price of the combination."
4,Not a bad vest with tiny pockets,"Its not a bad vest. Mine had actual pockets, but were tightly sewn shut. (I could see their outline, and I could feel the pocket insert.) So, I carefully cut the threads holding the pockets shut, and pulled out the those threads. And the result is, I have pockets, but they are really tiny pockets.Maybe I got a vest that was off-size or something, but I have a 42"" chest and the large was tight on me, but not too bad. Just enough to make me wonder whether or not I should have gotten a larger size.I especially like the tie.The tightening strap on the back of the vest looks ineffective and inexpensive, so I would rather wear the vest under a coat."
1,not true sizing,Ordered this vest and tie for my older son. It is small and not true to its size. I would order two sizes bigger than what you need.
3,It's not bad for what it is!,"It's not that bad of a product. It is what it is, I suppose. I use the vest for work, and for the most part, I'm satisfied with it, except for the fact that two of the buttons fell off on the vest and had to be replaced. I like the fact that tie matches the vest, and it does look. I would probably buy another again"
2,Vest not adjustable,"The adjuster on this vest is very poorly designed. The vest may not fit perfectly thus you may have to adjust it using the strap in the back, however it does not stay or clip in place on your torso and ends up looking bulky. I had to use safety pins to secure it in place."
4,A very nice resource for Hogarth etchings and artwork.,I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the book and how many illustrations there are. Dover publishers are usually very good with their art reproductions and available art instruction books and this was no exception. Great reproductions of the fine hatching and crosshatching work of a master.
5,Advanced Ghost Hunting !,"Experience first-hand the last gasps of those who have returned to haunt the places where they died and the final acts of the merciless killers who stalked their victims into the grave! Discover haunted houses, voices from the grave, vengeful spirits, bloody murders, strange disappearances, unsolved murders, ghosts of the Old West, Gangland hauntings, ghost infested jails and prisons and even the haunted history of some of America's most famous crimes!

(Also check out ""Strange Highways"" by Jerry D. Coleman)."
3,A little less than perfect,"The book arrived within the specified time and the book jacket was in perfect condition. However, this book was a gift for someone else who was very happy to receive it. She immediately started to flip through the pages, and to my embarrassment there was one page that had a tear in it. It wasn't a large tear but rather as if someone had dogeared the page and creased it too much causing the paper to tear off. Nonetheless, it marred an otherwise good experience."
3,3 stars but would I have ever cared,"bla bla bla, poetry for the poet. Nothing to interesting for college students and yet this author is touring colleges like the Grateful Dead in its hayday. Listen, some of this is interesting and some is just over my head. Other poems are arrogant and the structure is loose, and threadbare. Some poetry can make you snicker with irony or snarl from the gut. This feels like each poem has an idea, which is cut in half, ensuing a second line with double the idea, only to be doubled exponentially etc... through the last line. I felt like it was a cheap and at times lame product that should have been more concise and made into a novel."
5,Best war movie I've seen.,"The action is riveting & very realistic. However, I agree with the rest of the people the sub-titled version is much better."
5,Well-written western (oxymoron?).,"An early hamilton work, the story involves an eastern-born civil war veteran come to the west to heal. He interacts with a selection of stock western types, gets the girl(s) and triumphs responsibly. Well-drawn characters, accurate history and geography, precise ballistics and gun lore. There is even a sex scene that is neither purple nor victorian. This book deserves another printing, as do the other hamilton westerns."
1,doesn't work,"This stuff doesn't work. I don't know if it is because it evaporates very quickly (less than 24 hours), or if it just plain doesn't work. I tried using it to keep the cats out of the dining room, but they continue pooping on the carpet regardles of whether I use the spray."
1,My cat laughs at this,"So I tried it for the couch, did not work. For the doors, did not work. Soaked a cloth with it and hung it over the couch- did not work. The moment I spray my cat walks up. Sniffs. And gets cozy. For me and my cat, this was a waste of money. Hope other people have more success."
3,not recommended,"Basically I regret buying this monitor. I should have paid attention to customer comments on another review site, but the Viewsonic name and low price convinced me to buy it. BIG MISTAKE, I get headaches and eye fatigue from this LCD, who gets those from an LCD??? Gaming looks terrible, while there is zero ghosting there is a strange grainey look to games(F.E.A.R., Half-life 2) which looked great on my old CRT.Viewsonic may have a good reputation but this particular model is a bad buy. Oh yeah, I've got dead pixels as well. They are in areas that do not bother me at all though(top right corner, one very faint on left side of screen) but still a dead pixel is a dead pixel."
2,"ViewSonic VA702B 17"" LCD Monitor","The monitor itself is sharp and has good contrast and brightness. Unfortunatley, I was one of the ones lucky enough to recieve a monitor with dead pixels. It has 2 or 3 dead pixel and ViewSonic says it's ""within specs"" and will not replace it.Don't know about you but when I buy something new I expect it to be in pefect condition, not ""close enough.""Be warned, ViewSonic has a certain amount of allowable dead pixels to be within their specifications. That's like buying a new car with a cracked windshield.Talk about poor customer relations."
4,very good monitor for the money,"For the money this is a very good monitor. The price seemed to fluctuate day to day. The controls on the front face are a little difficult to get used to. But once learned, they aren't too bad. It did come with a video cable to connect to the CPU. It does NOT have digital video hook up and It does NOT have built in speakers. Very small footprint so it takes up very little desk space."
3,Good for the price,"I have has this monitor since 2006 and it is still running strong. I would steer buyers away from this though, it's 12MS response time is rather sluggish compared to the modern 5MS. It is very bright but can occasionally cause fatigue in the eye. Overall a great monitor and never had an issue."
3,Why is the center-hole cut so big?,"Aside from this mere oversight mentioned in the title, I appreciate the adhesive and ink-transferability qualities of these labels. So much so, that I settled for fashioning an adapter from a disc-protector for an easier application. In comparison to other (regular) cd-labels on the market, these are the best at sticking to any cd-r as many players would run hot over time. 1-10 for overall satisfaction: I would give a 8.25."
5,"Exquisite illustrations/woodcuts, very informative","This is a beautiful text which is easy to read and reference. I've learned a lot from it. It's made for those who love books and the craftsmanship of publishing, not for those seeking colorful photographs."
4,"Big Size, Big Sound, Small Price","At night, this radio pulls in stations from the South and Midwest with nothing but its built-in antenna (I live in northern NJ). The sound quality for music is a bit boomy, but for voice alone I would rate the quality as a ""5"". I own two...one is downstairs in the basement and it still pulls in distant stations; the other is upstairs where I don't even have to extend the built-in antenna. One thing I hate about most radios, and I own about a dozen, is station drifting. But this Superadio does not drift. The only negative I can think of is the size and weight."
3,"Good Design, Variable Quality","I bought a SuperRadio 3 after years of satisfaction from the previous SuperRadio 2 model. The first '3' I bought had great AM sensitivity and terrible FM sensitivity compared to my older SuperRadio. I exchanged it and and the tables were exactly reversed, excellent FM performance and poor AM performance. It seems as if there's a problem aligning these radios properly in GE's Chinese factory. On my sixth radio, I finally got a sample with fairly balanced performance, although still not as good as the discontinued SuperRadio 2 (sorry). In spite of this, and the poor tuning accuracy, the radio is still a good value. To restate others, battery life is long and audio is excellent. Buy from someplace with a good return policy. There may still be some lemons out there. Its worth the effort to find a good sample."
3,Lop off two stars for build quality,The Superadio lives up to the reputation it has for AM sensitivity so I will not repeat it here. It is a joy to listen to.However the radio case and knobs are made of the cheapest possible material. The entire set looks like it was made in a bargain-basement Chinese factory. Handle it roughly and I suspect it will fall apart.I wish that the manufacturer would have a better cabinet and build quality. Would not mind paying more for better quality!
1,terrible calibration,this is the second superadio that i have returned..it seems my regular staions are off by at least an inch on the dial..i was very disappointed in the quality of this product.i was expecting a good product but i am sure these units are defective or maybe returned units that amazon is pawning off..
3,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for a radio that could play AM radio inside a hospital, but just like any other radio, no can do unless you are by an open window. The radio is fine otherwise."
3,"Its not very durable, but it does pick up weak stations.","My 1st one didn't last much over a year before it stopped working. Perhaps exposing it to the temperature extremes next to a leaky Northwest facing window (in Iowa) contributed to its early death.Since it is the least expensive amplified AM radio out there, and because it does pick up weak AM stations, I'll be buying another one. Hopefully it will last longer."
4,G.E.Super Radio,"1.Sound Quality- Excellent2.Markings- Hard To Read3.Tuning Scale - Hard To Read4.Tuning- Good To Fair5.Knobs/Switches-Poor Feel,Cheap, Hard To Read 6.On/Off Switch- Noisey7.Radio Case-Cheap Plastic, Odd Size8.Overall-Good at what it was designed to do,reproduce sound and it does it extremely well for a portable radio!"
1,good lookin radio,"wont play inside my house and stay on 1 station. tuning knob wont let you set it at 1 station, about 3 come blasting thru. the volume switch is as poorly made too. you cant adjust the volume to the right setting.dont buy this, it looks good, but wont play inside, i have put an antenna on it to the outside, it didnt help, i havent taken the radio outside. the older radios were great radios, this is a cheap knockoff running on the old radios name.AMAZON is a great company, tho. this is just a bad product.shipping was great, packed right, just a bad ripoff from the people that owns the rights to the radio.sign me, displeased.dale maloney"
1,Don't Buy This Radio - Poor Quality,"Here is my experience with this radio. I ordered it thru Amazon, it was shipped out of a business in California named Beach Audio. It took longer than the shipping notice, cost me 11.49 and 9 days later I recieved the radio. I opened the box, turned on the radio and the tuning dial would not move. The radio was never quality tested since it could never have worked. I then called Beach Audio in Hermosa Beach CA, and they smugly informed me that I would have to pay the shipping both ways to get an exchanged item. This means that I am paying $22 for an exchange item that NEVER worked and cost me $40. I will not buy anything from either Amazon or Beach Audio again. I also am looking hard at whether I will buy any GE products since this was so blatantly defective."
1,WHAT THE?!?!???,"Seriously?!?! I bought this product with the hopes of having a portable radio to listen to my favorite NFL team's games. Currently I can pick up the reception from that radio station fairly well in my car, and poorly on the best radio that I have (which surprisingly is a Sony Shower Radio!). I put my SIX! New D batteries into this Beast of a Radio. Undid the 3 foot long antenna, and pressed the Flintstone Sized Power Button with great anticipation.... Nothing!!!!! I could not even get the signal in the least! what's worse, is that on another station that i sometimes listen to, a different signal on the same or close frequency came in stronger and the station that i want wouldn't come in at all.This thing is a total waste of money, i'm so disgusted."
1,"Total, complete, utter garbage","I have one of these, and it is complete [...].I live only 3 miles from the tower for one of the strongest stations in Cincinnati, yet I can't pick it up at all on the GE Stuporadio III. I've never had a radio with such awful reception.This is especially astounding because everyone keeps talking about what great reception it has. If this is the best radio currently being made, then I'd hate to hear the worst.Don't buy this piece of garbage."
2,I am sorry for listening to all the hyped reviews!,"Bought this because most of the reviews say really good at picking up week signals. Got it so I could listen to week stations at work, brick building. Cheep radio at work works better than this. At home it can receive stations but only with the help of an dipol anntenna. Only nice thing is when it can get that weak channel it can hold it."
1,no stars,I have always had good luck with G.E. electronics So after searching the web I ignored the negatives and ordered one. What a mistake!!!! Out of the box the AM. band was nothing but static.(New batteries). The switches had to be held down to operate. Great looking case thats it. Sent it back. I'll have to eat $20 shiping. Read the negatives. I learned...
5,This has outstanding reception!,"I have owned about 40 AM/FM radios in my lifetime. This includes ones in my cars, connected to my home stereo system, on my boat, etc. I bought my first GE Superadio from Sears in the mid to late 90s. I loved it so much I went back and bought a second one. Both Superradios give far superior reception to AM/FM radios that I paid much more for. The sound is great and the value for money rates a solid 5 stars. This radio really does an outstanding job of pulling in AM or FM stations that other radios cannot touch."
3,Somewhat disappointed.,"Overall I'm pleased as the radio has a good feel to it and an excellent tone. I would have to rate it as just a ""little better"" than average in getting distant stations. I am going to try an external antenna (it has a hookup)."
2,This isn't your dad's Superadio......unfortunately.,"I had heard that GE farmed out maufacturing of the current Superadio III to another company, and that this current model was sub-par compared to the older Superadios. I rolled the dice and ordered one any way. Shipping was quick. My nostalgia for the quaint bulky design and big-speaker sound was satisfied. FM reception was always just okay even on the older models, so no big surprises there...but the real problem, and it is a big one, is that regardless of signal stregnth you'll never quite feel that you've tuned the dial to exactly the right spot to properly hear your station of choice, especially on AM (but FM too). There's an annoying hiss and other noise indicative of a poorly tuned in station -- no matter which station you choose. Using the wide/ narrow band switch doesn't help. If you don't mind the sloppy tuning and not-so-great reception, the Superadio III is not a total disaster; it does work. There's just nothing super about it any more."
2,Not as strong as I had hoped for,I really bought this radio hoping to receive an FM station 60 miles away. That didn't happen. I can pull this station in on my GM car radio anytime. Also wanted it to pull in a weak AM station less than 20 miles away after 6 pm. It will receive it but so weak and garbled that it is hard to listen. From 8pm til midnight there are so many stations mixed up on most frequencies on this radio and not many can you get clear. I would not buy this radio again.
4,Decent Radio,I have owned this radio for about 1 year and am happy with my purchase. It has very good AM reception and average FM reception. I'm certain that better radios are available but not for the money. I paid $45.00 for mine from Radio Shack's website.
2,Not as good as advertrised.,"Over all it is a good radio, however I have not been impressed with the so call ability for it to pick up long range radio stations. I have not found it to be much better then an older portable radio that I have which is much smaller and cost much less. IE: I am not able to pick up FM Stations 30 miles away, and can only pick up one AM station that is only 5 miles away. It is large and the sound is good. The receiver dial is way off IE: a station that should be at 99.9 on the FM dial is found around 101. This makes me wonder if that is one reason I can not pick up stations on the low end of the dial IE: FM 89.9 and that was my main reason for purchsing this radio. Basically I took a gamble that did not pay off!"
1,Also Disappointed,I must have gotten a bad one. It will not pick up stations as easily as my other analog radios so i don't quite understand how the other reviewers are giving it such high marks. I have a feeling the older models were much better; probably a different mfr. The sound is decent when it does but i could have spent and have spent much less for a better radio. I travel alot and most hotel alarm clock radios have better reception. One of my co-workers has one in his office and he must have gotten a bad one too.
1,Review of the GE&-2887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio,"I purchased the above mentioned radio last November, and was more than pleased with it's sound and the ability to bring in many stations. In the last week the radio doesn't bring in stations and hold them whether on AM or FM. I am now very disappointed that Amazon.com told me the warranty is no longer in force. I am stuck with a radio which I liked very much and is now useless to me. I don't know how many people save the original boxes this long, but I am not one of them. Even under these conditions, I will continue to be a good customer of Amazon.com."
1,Nothing super about this radio.,I bought this radio based on reviews and newsgroup messages saying that this was a really good radio at pulling in weak signals. Thats just what I needed as I work in a metal building and I can barley get 3 stations. So I bought this with that in mind. I get it out of the box and I can hardly tune in WLS and I live 30 miles from Chicago. So I try FM the tuner numbers don't match up with the frequency and I can barley get any stations at all and they are all so static filled that I turned it off and back in the box it went. I calling today to see if I can return it.
2,Cheap and looks it,"I own this one. Well, it's cheap and it pulls in some stations that others don't, but it's nothing exceptional. If you buy it, expect the worst build quality you've ever seen. Feels and looks like the cheapest [...] imaginable. Spend a little more money and get a decent radio like a Kaito."
2,Disappointing,It did not live up to its claim. The reception wasn't as good as the radio I already had. I returned it.
3,Could be better,"I just receive my radio and tried to set it on a station. I was on my patio and the light was low. I could not see the station dial. It was impossible to see. I took the radio in doors, selected a station and return ourdoors to listen to it.A simple little light bulb would be all that this radio needed. Very little thought went into the design of the users friendly features. Secondly, why don't we make anything in this country any longer? This has the GE Logo but is made in China."
3,"hiss, snap, & crackle","Let me preface this by saying I am no radio expert. All I wanted was good sound quality on FM. I have been trying for an hour to get my new Superadio III tuned in without any noise, but there is a constant hiss. (When listening to classical music, the hiss is very noticable during the quiet moments.) There are other occasional noises too. I tried every feature and antenna position, including batteries vs. AC cord, but nothing helps. If you are sensitive to background noise, you won't be satisfied with this radio even though it is a bargain. If it weren't for the noise I would like the sound; it is mono but rich and powerful.I don't like the huge dimensions (9 h X 13 w X 3.5 d) but I could have lived with that. I'm going to have to return it."
3,superadio 3 is not that super,"i was looking for a radio that would receive new york city radio stations ( WOR and WABC etc, i am about 75 miles away ) this one doesn't do the job. i use a tivoli PAL radio which does a better job at pulling in those stations. i will probably get a shortwave radio with an am band and see how that does. it is not a terrible radio it just doesn't do the job that i want it to."
2,no better than my throwaways,"after countless researching and reviews, I had to get it. I have a new AM station that's ~20 miles away broadcasting 10K day, 1K nights. My two current old and CHEAP radios picked it up but they would fade in and out. Well in a side by side comparision, all 3 are the same. I've not yet fooled with how many 500+ mile stations I can get but for pulling in a weak local station - it's a waste of money."
3,Old Fashsion -- mediocore reception,"I bought this a while back for the garage and was fairly disappointed. It uses old tuning technology and the station would continually drift. The sound was ok, but a little bassy. I'm guessing a lot of people buy it for nostalgic reasons. I ended up selling it."
3,A GOOD LITTLE DINOSAUR.,"THIS IS JUST A SHORT REVIEW TO TELL ANY PROSPECTIVE BUYER TO GO AHEAD AND GET THIS FINE PERFORMER. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT A FAIRLY ""NEUTRAL "" RATING IS BECAUSE THIS MODEL IS BARE BONES ON FEATURES.( NO LIGHTED DIAL, NO PUSHBUTTONS AND A DIAL INDICATOR THAT'S NOT AT ALL ACCURATE ). BUT THE TONE IS VERY GOOD AND THE BASS AND TREBLE TUNERS ACTUALLY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN SOUND. I HAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED HOURS ON THE BATTERIES AND THERE'S NO SIGN OF THEM FADING OUT. THE RADIO IS TERRIFIC AT PICKING AND HOLDING AM STATIONS AND HAS GOOD SELECTIVITY AND SENSITIVITY . FM, WHICH IS USUALLY NOT A PROBLEM ANYWHERE, IS PERFECTLY TUNED BY THIS MODEL AND HAS AN AFC WHICH WORKS WELL. THE PURPOSE OF THESE RADIOS, FOR MY THINKING,IS THE AM TUNING CAPABILITIES AND THIS SUPER RADIO DOES IT FOR A BARGAIN PRICE. IT'S A 5 STAR PERFORMER STASHED IN A PLAIN BROWN ENVELOPE. I HEARTILY RECOMMEND IT TO YOU."
5,Radio Station Owner Says YES!,"I own 4 radio stations(3 FMs and 1 AM) and have looked for a portable radio that will deliver great sound in both bands plus excellent reception. This does it. Both the FM and AM reception are excellent even without external antennas. The AM section is so good, my wife thought we were listening to FM. There is a 2-way speaker system plus separate bass and treble controls, which provide good fidelity. The GE SuperRadio 3 is everything I've read about. It is powered by AC cord or batteries, making it a great go-anywhere radio."
1,"Very disappointing, Poor reception","I had the original version of this radio which I used to capture an FM station in Ann Arbor, about 40 miles from here. It was in all respects a great radio. So I bought this one expecting at least equal performance. But I was sorely disappointed. Not only can I not get the Ann Arbor station (for which reason I bought the radio) I cannot recieve the local NPR Station, one of the strongest FM signals broadcast in Detroit. I have tried many things including adding an FM antenna but the problem persists. I think the problem must be laid to GE's uneven manufacturing quality."
5,Satisfied customer,Great reception. Good sound. Easy to use. Only downside is that it is larger then anticipated.
4,Very good sound,"Stations come in very good; good sound.....not tinny. Only problem, cover over battery/cord section keeps falling off. Would prefer cord being detachable."
4,A bit of history,"As someone who worked for the GE Audio division back when the first Superadio was developed, I can attest to the fact that the product was seriously designed as a very high quality piece. The engineers had their GE radio reputations on the line, and the concept of good mono vs. bad stereo obviously had market appeal.Over the years, inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made (I was part of some of these types of discussions as well), but when I was looking for a good portable radio, this version was high on the list. We have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound. One problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out, but that's why we have Amazon, right?"
1,No better than a cheap AM radio,"Unless I got a junk unit, I have a hard time pulling in local AM stations with atenna fully extanded.The sound qualty is a 3 star on FM.""Superadio"" is not any better than other radios at 1/4 the price.I must be missing something!"
1,poor fm reception,"The FM reception is very poor--hard to find on the F M dial, and lots of static. AM reception is good.If FM is the desired listening bandwidth, I would pass on this product."
1,terrible tuning,"I've had this radio since 1995 and I still use it - after all, I paid money for it. But if it broke, I'd buy a $5 hand held and get the same quality. The Superadio has the worst tuner I've ever used. It is very touchy and will go out if I move the radio from the floor to table (I live outside Chicago and there are dozens of local stations.) The ""wide band"" makes no difference to reception. I've been disappointed since I bought it."
2,"What makes this a Superadio ""3"" ????","I have one of the ORIGINAL SUPERADIOS. For the price it is a GREAT VALUE !!! But by the time they got to the 3 model I would have thought there would be some improvements made, a LED Backlighted frequency scale would be nice, and a more accurate frequency indicator !!! BUT NO, as far as I can tell the 3 is identical to the original. I will stick to my original and my CC RADIO EP and my Grundig S350.Matt-General class HAM radio operator"
1,Don't buy it,"This is just a radio, big, black and ugly! I wanted a great sound reception. I can't get any a.m. reception and the f.m. is lousy compared to my $10.00 sony alarm clock radio. I paid 60.00 plus 13.00 S&H and will now have to pay that much to ship it back if the seller even agrees to reimburse the cost! Totally disappointed and frustrated! Such a hassle! This product is a waste of time and money!!!"
2,GE Superadio is not super anymore,"I have owned three of these radios. They once performed well, especially distant AM reception. The present version of this radio hardly performs any better than your average $10 radio. At times, the Am reception from distant cities can be good. But try to listen to a baseball game from a station only 35 miles away, and you have to correct the drift about every two minutes. My wife saw my frustration one night, turned on the cheap table top radio and sure enough it held the station and had a better sound."
1,Must be a Quality Control problem......,"If you are going to buy this radio, make sure you purchase it from a retailer with a good return/exchange policy. The unit I got absolutely blew! I got better AM reception with my $7 clock radio on my nightstand."
2,excellant am section...BUT,"I decided to purchase this radio to replace my 20 year old Superadio II I use at work. It was not what I had expected. My old Superadio II had excellant FM reception where I work but this radio seems to be ""noisy"" with more background interferance. Don't get me wrong...this is a great radio if your outside or a fan of talk radio. This would make a great pool radio...but that's not why I bought it...I'm returning to Amazon and sticking with my old Superadio II till something better comes along."
4,Radio listener's treat,"My father is a huge fan of this radio, as I am. Sound quality is very good without being a boom-box. This radio does a good job pulling in weak AM signals, so it would be a good choice if you live in a remote area."
4,Works Pretty Much as Advertised,"The radio is super-sensitive. I work well outside of my metro area and before I bought it I could only receive what few local stations were in the area. The radio rescued my sanity from a desert of static, country/western, and local talk radio. It pulls in the university-owned AM band National Public Radio affiliate reasonably well, a station that only the Toyota/JBL unit in my car also receives well. The selectivity, even on narrow, is still hit and miss with the equipment in our facility and the performance in stormy weather is par for AM, but I am happy. The radio is worth its price. Maybe more than its price."
4,"Excellent Radio, Mediocre Construction","This radio does have excellent reception, it's a great size, it's not overly greedy with power and is dual-powered. Unfortunately, build quality leaves much to be desired. The stations are nowhere near the index markings on the dial. The knobs are quite delicate. I'd have happily paid twice the price to get a radio with a digital tuner and sturdier cosmetics. In the meantime, I'll certainly enjoy this one and congratulate all of us who made an excellent buy!"
2,Interesting and amuzing but no Toby Crabel,"Toby Crabel's articles deal with the same issues , and on top of that he gives you the statistical breakdown.Much better than Fisher's stingy musings."
2,Missing essential info,"At first glance it seems like a great book. The author early on tells you the ACD methodology is the basis of the system. The A and C values determine the trade entries in relation to the opening range and the pivot range. The B and d values determine your stop. It all seems so nice. Guess What? The calculation of the A and C numbers is proprietary and changes with the market's daily movements. You can get these if you subscribe to the author's research material for a fee. The values for December 2001 are given in the appendix, but don't reflect today's numbers. If you use those values you will lose your money. The book is expensive, so you would expect to be given a method to at least ascertain rudimentary values. It would be an awesome book otherwise. I guess if you want to subscribe to the service all will be well."
3,Full of high sentence but a bit obtuse,"At times almost ridiculous.No really...Using the opening range as a basis for trading works. I do it every day. But Fisher makes it all into a highly ideosyncratic dance to which he holds a magic key. The value of A and C.TO me the book is poorly written and makes much more of things than need be.If you doodle around with Tradestation and do a little thinking you can find your own way of trading the opening range and it will probably be a lot more flexible than Fisher's. And you won't need to worry about computing the magical numbers.Fisher is from the 'pivot' school and says the calculated pivot ranges are 'more powerful'. I don't believe it, and he offers no proof.I'm from the support/resistance school and think that the pivot calculations are purely arbitrary with no logical basis. The only reason they sometimes work is the number of other 'pivot people' out there who also think they work."
1,ACD - A Crappy Deal,"I agree totally with the previous review. What kind of book on systems has ""secret"" variables that are only available by subscribing to a service. I found myself lost (or re-reading the previous pages as if I missed something) when the author introduces the ""secret A"" variable within the first few pages, which is a key point to the system, but won't disclose any of the ""secret"" methods to derive this variable. What a joke...So much for the authors ""messianic willings"" to share his system with the public for $60, as Paul Jones claims on the back of the book. Basically, for $60 you get a puff piece making you ask ""where's the beef"". If you care to waste your time, I suggest you read some of the junk you probably already receive in the mail regarding ""secret"" systems rather than spending $60 on this promotional piece of work."
3,Missing the target,"My opinion is that if the author really want to share its knowledge of the markets and help traders to become more profitable, then he must accept to disclose all values (kept secrets because it is proprietary research) and clearly explain when his method should be in use. Yes, the method will work fine if ""there is enough volatility and enough liquidity"" but numbers are true guidelines in that matter. Numbers would serve to put the ACD method in a proper context, so it can be evaluated properly. Without such precisions, the book appears pretty useless and becomes more or less an advertisement, just as many others trading books.The method ""may be"" logic, but it is definitely incomplete."
2,Too many secrets,"The book contains some great ideas, such as buy or sell an opening range breakout of x or more points or use the range for support/resistance plays. The only problems are:1. It will not tell you how many minutes to use for marking the opening range. The method for calculating that is secret.2. It will not tell you how to calculate x, as that too is secret.Your only option is to email the author (you have to find the web site first!) and ask about your specific stock or future. I wrote an email four days ago asking about the settings needed for the S&P eminis and have yet to receive a response.The book also contains many errors and missing information/references. It was clearly rushed to market."
1,something better,While this charger was good in it's day there is now something better... a new charger that has no metal contacts to mess with. Over time the contacts on this and similar chargers and the contacts on the wii remotes corrode with use and this charger losses it's effectiveness... now thanks to the re-chargable electric toothbrush technology there is a wii remote charger that is contactless also .... check it out here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017KCUEQ
2,One for two,I bought this as a package with a wii second hand from someone. One of the batteries does not work. The other one works fine and is great. I am now using other rechargeable AAs in my other wiimotes.
2,"Poor battery life, replacements are $10 each","This product is pretty good, except that the rechargeable batteries have a short life-span (mine lasted only 4 months) and replacements are $10 each, so if you use your Wii about as much as I do, it is going to cost you $60 per year in replacement batteries for 2 Wii remotes. I very much doubt this is a better value than using a general-purpose rechargeable battery in the remote."
2,Poor Design,"I have to agree with many of the posts. A great idea, but poor design. I found that you must remove skins and move wrist straps out of the way to charge. Removing the skins was bad enough, but I don't like the fact that you have to remove or reposition the wrist strap. You simply can't drop the remote in the slot and have it charge. You have to position it with your hands and make sure you get solid connection.However, I will say once you DO get the connection the charger works as advertised. If you are looking for a charger, there are not that many great choices, so you have to take what you can get (right now). I'd look around for a better design."
2,Poor design overall,I do not recomend this product. I have three problems with it.1. I had difficulty getting the wiimote to sit properly in the cradle so it would get a connection and charge at all.2. The contacts needed constant cleaning because they are right under your hand has you are holding the wiimote.3. One of the two batteries died (would no longer take a charge) less than 6 months after I bought it.
2,Not as good as the MadCatz,"This product does what it advertises, however it's NOT compatible with the Wii Motion Plus AND you have to take the sleeve off the remote to charge it or get rid of it all together. Just beware of those two factors when purchasing this item."
1,Frustrating!,"This product has given me nothing but headaches! I have to place and replace the controllers on the base in an effort to get them to recharge. Once I get one of the controllers recharging and then attempt to place the second controller, it usually dislodges the first controller and I have to start again. If I can get both controllers recharging in under 4 minutes, I consider myself lucky. And don't even get me started on where to tuck the wrist strap while attempting to load the unit. Yikes!I CANNOT recommend purchasing this product, however I would recommend the other unit I purchased which is a Psyclone brand that has the recharging connectors on the bottom of the unit."
3,Nice charger but prevents use of Wii wheel and guns.,"As far as function goes, the charger worked fine. I returned mine however because, with the added thickness of the new battery cover, the Wiimote will NOT fit into many of the additional items often used to play some of the games......namely the Wii Wheel, Nyko Sure Shot gun, or the zapper. The original Wiimote covers will NOT fit over the rechargeable Nyko battery packs. As an alternative, I purchased a Duracell battery charger that came with 4 pre-charged AA batteries. I simply recharge the Duracells and reload them into the Wiimote.The bottom line is: if you always use the Wiimote by itself, the charger is a nice buy. On the other hand, if you use the guns or Wii wheel, this set-up just won't work."
1,Wii charge station,"Batteries dont hold charge an hr. Might be an old unit, lasted a week and we tossed it.All of the Wii stuff is a great idea but know of its worked my sons refer to it as Waa,"
2,Wii Charge Station,This was a purchase for my son as he recieved a Wii for Christmas. This product is not as good as he was expecting. Not sure that I would purchase another one if we purchased another Wii.
2,After a month one of the battieres died.,"One of the batteries died on me after only having it a little over a month. It worked great while it work, charge your batteries in less than an hour and provide hours of play time, although sometimes while playing it would drop connection with the remote. Then it started to die (if it gets increasingly hard to get the charger to charge the battery it is about to die!) I suggest waiting to see what kind of solution Nintendo might offer. Only buy this if you absolutely must have it, because you risk getting a defective product. Or keep the package it comes with so you can walk into Wal-Mart and get another one."
3,Great product with few flaws,"works great but there are a few problems, the wrist straps have no place to sit so more often then not you have to spend a few seconds trying to actually get them into the slot. the only other problem is you cant buy expansion packs where it has 2 more covers and battery packs without having to buy another charge kits... works great and charges fast i like the covers more then the standard Wii battery covers. overall a must have for any serious Wii player.."
2,Beware recharging issues,"In concept this is a great idea. The Wii remotes suck batteries like a hungry dog at a steak factory. The main issue is that the designers didn't consider the fact that there is a Wii strap at the bottom of the remotes. Thus, it is VERY difficult to seat the remotes properly to recharge the units if the straps are on. My son just places the remotes in the cradle - sometimes he gets them seated properly, sometimes he doesn't. Either way, it's absolutely stupid of the manufacturer to create a device that does not take into consideration a basic aspect of the Wii remote. And to expect the user to take the strap off with every recharge is ridiculous."
2,May not be worthwhile,"For some users, this product may be of little value.The Wii remote operates on 2 AA batteries. For anyone that already owns some AA rechargable batteries and an external charger, this unit duplicates that functionality. It does come with two battery packs and two replacement backs that expose electrical contacts to allow the batteries to be charged without the hassle of removing them from the remote.But that benefit is lost when a Motion Plus adapter is installed. That adapter extends the length of the Wii remote, and the unit no longer fits in the charger cradle until it's removed. So, turns into a choice of hassles: remove the Motion Plus adapter, or remove the batteries for charging externally."
3,Necessary Accessory!,Works great. Battery packs work fine with Guitar that comes with Guitar Hero III. The only issue I have is that the left side charging spot is hard to get the remote lined up with the contacts. I have to play with the remote for a good 10-15 seconds before it is seated properly and the light indicates it is charging.
1,Dead on arrival,"The unit was given as a gift. When we plugged it in for the first time, we noticed that the LED indicators in the front of the unit were not lighting up. To test the possibility that it was a defect just with the LEDs while the normal charging of the batteries worked, we used both batteries until they were completely empty and then tried to charge them. After a night of charging, neither of them had been charged at all. Furthermore, when we opened up the unit, there were bits of glue sloppily placed all within the interior of the unit with capacitors bent in odd and disorganized directions with no clear indication of circuit-paths. The shoddy workmanship is likely the reason for the poor quality of these units."
1,"Great idea, horrible execution.","This whole concept was a great idea, I love the idea of not having to constantly buy AA batteries. However the reality of this product is much different from what I imagined, I purchased this product about a week ago and have had nothing but problems with keep the Wii-Mote on with these damn batteries they are constantly losing power as the battery will not stay connected properly. Like the title says, great idea - horrible execution."
2,Good Idea - Bad Implementation,The unit does work however many times I have found that sometimes the unit loses its connection and the battery is dead next time you want to use it. Other times it works fine. Should be redesigned to hold the unit more securely while charging.
2,Works fine when you finally get it to work,"The batteries work fine. The recharging works fine. I've never had a battery go dead on me, even after hours of play.HOWEVER, it is next to impossible to balance the Wiimotes on this thing for them to charge correctly. If you want to keep the wrist straps on, which I'm sure you do, good luck getting the metal chargers to line up with the Wiimote. I've studied this thing and looked at every possibility to get them to work correctly, including reversing the knot on the strap and experimenting with every possible placement. But simply put, this thing never should have made it past R&D.; Two stars for the batteries, three stars off for ridiculous design.I wish the Wii InCharge Dual Charge Station had been available when I bought this one. You don't have to balance anything when using the InCharge, and you can even keep the sleeves on."
2,Wii-mote won't stay on,"I have had this charger since I go my Wii last summer. I didn't have the caughting on fire problem (that would be really bad), but this charger has a really bad problem of not charging that batteries because the Wii-mote had to be sitting perfectly on the base. This was no easy task especially if you leave the wrist strap on the Wii-mote. There were several time when someone would bump the table where I was charging the Wii-motes and I would have to go and set them back up perfectly so they would charge. I ended up just using some NI-MH rechargeable batteries instead. I have seen other base chargers that looked like they would hold the Wii-mote in place better. I would suggest looking around a bit more before buying this one."
4,"Great product, but LEDs are annoying when trying to sleep","The only problems I have with this product are that the blue/green LEDs are really bright and can make it difficult to sleep and that sometimes it is hard to position the wrist strap so the Wii remote doesn't move and disconnect the battery contacts.But, it doesn't take very long for the remotes to charge. Overnight, at the most, so if you put the remotes back in after playing, the batteries are always fully charged. But when you forget to put the remotes in after playing, it's no big deal, because the charge lasts a long time."
1,After limited use both battery packs are dead,"We do not use our Wii often, so the wiimotes spend most of their time on the charger. This worked well for a short time, but after a few months of non-use we found that both the battery packs were completely dead. We cannot even turn on the Wiimotes.This product was a waste of money. We will be switching to regular rechargeables now."
4,Still going strong,"I bought the charging station four years ago. The batteries don't hold a charge quite as long as they used to, but they still last for several hours. It can sometimes be difficult to get the controllers to fit so that they land properly against the contact points, but that's really my only complaint. This turned out to be a good investment."
4,Finally an Electric Plug-in Recharger,We couldn't find an electrical plug-in Wii remote charger anywhere locally. Once again Amazon came to the rescue. This does work quite well but you do have to place the remotes exactly correct for the charge light to come on.
4,Love this item,"No more hunting around for spare batteries--this solves the problem of the battery-hungry wiimotes! The only thing I don't like is that I can't use the rubber wiimote covers with this, b/c the charger is in the back of them, not the bottom. That's a small inconvenience considering that these babies are always fully charged, which is key now that we have Netflix streaming!"
4,If the controllers would only leap in the cradle...,"This works very well, it is a LITTLE fussy when placing them in the cradle and the add on 'sensor' cannot be on the controller while charging, nor can the rubber sleeve, which discourages the use of both. The LED lights fully indicate if you have it right and it charges quite quickly. We have been using ours for a few months now and see not degradation in the batteries as of yet.09/2011: The batteries are still holding good full charge. this is a GOOD DEAL."
2,Hard to use,"We've been using this charge station and battery sets for some time and have been less than happy with it.Pros: Good battery lifeCons: difficult to fit the wiimote into the cradle and make the electrical connection. Contacted customer service after a month of problems and they said to bend the terminals in the cradle. This solves the problem for the first few uses afterward but they need to be ""adjusted"" constantly."
4,Charging Station,"We have had this for a couple years now and everything still works well. We have saved a lot of money by having this. Just now the batteries seem to not be holding a charge like they used to, but they are still working so we are happy. Good idea to have."
4,Batteries Drain Themselves,"The only complaint is that if you don't use your Wiimotes for a few weeks, they will come out of the dock dead. This is because the dock stops charging when the battery reports full. It doesn't bother checking the battery level until you lift it out and place it back in the dock. This is normally not an issue since most people don't leave their Wii sitting for weeks unused. This product is great otherwise and if I had more Wiimotes I'd buy another dock."
5,Save yourself some $$$,We bought this and it paid us back in less than a month. We have had this for almost a year without issue. It charges fast.
5,Works Great,"Thank You - It works better than I expected. I like that I can plug the charger into a 110 outlet and not into the console. I will probably buy another one, as I'm thinking about buying 2 more remotes. I received it very quick and in great condition. Thank You"
4,Good for charging,Great alternative to batteries. Working out well for me and keeps my controllers charged. Only thing I didn't like is that you pretty much have to take the safety strap off in order to get the contact you need to charge.
1,Worked well for short period of time,"I purchased this charging station 3 years ago. It worked well for a few months and then began to be finicky over the placement of the remote in order to charge. I'd put it on the charger and it would turn to green (meaning doesn't require a charge) but the batteries were dead. Move it around a little bit and it would stay charging. Over time it became more difficult to find the charge 'sweet spot', and eventually it wouldn't charge at all. I'm not sure if it's the battery unit or the charger, but didn't want to replace either to find out. I think it was a couple of years before it's complete demise (and we don't use the wii as often as many folks do). Not to mention if they went dead in the middle of play, you'd have to replace with other batteries anyway or stop playing (and it only charges when in the remote). I don't recommend this product, I think separate rechargeable batteries are a better investment."
2,"Good initial performance, one year later daed","Quick and short, i did not regularly put my remotes into the charger every night. only upon drain did we recharge.after about one year, it no longer charges/hold charge."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I bought this charge station for Christmas with a new Wii remote. It's a month and 4 days later and only one remote works the other never gets a charge no matter how long I leave it on the charger. My two boys have just been taking turns playing until I bought some regular batteries. I was very disappointed in this charge station. I would not recommend this to anyone. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET UNTIL IT'S IMPROVED.
4,Nyko charger,Work great. These are good chargers. Just need to put the wii in correctly. Great size. Good product for our family.
3,Wii Charge Station Saves Money,"This isn't a game; it's a useful accessory, and isn't ""fun."" TA recharger saves money and environmental impact since you don't need to feed disposable batteries to each remote three times a week. The trade-off is that Nintendo's soft, protective sleeves won't work with the remotes in the charging station. If you use the wrist-strap, however, you won't lose your grip. The rechargeable battery case has a soft, grippable pad on it, so you do get some finger-feel. The initial investment is worthwhile because you don't spend money and time replacing batteries. Recharge time varies based on remote use; 1/2 hour is typical. Training your kids to put the remotes back in the station takes about a week."
4,"Great product, two minor quibbles","As others have mentioned, this works great. Nice not to even have to worry about replacing batteries or taking rechargeables out of the remotes.Also as others have mentioned, the two drawbacks are that you have to take care to ensure the remotes sit just right in the charger and are charging, and you can't use them with a skin on the remote. Given the success of the product, I hope NYKO comes out with their own skin that would be compatabile with the charger."
3,Worked well until it broke.,"This product worked well for about 3 months. Then one of the gold connectors popped out, and neither side of the charger would work. I was disappointed as I only had used the charger about 4-5 times. Unfortunately this happened a few weeks after the 90 day warranty expired. I ordered another one however."
3,Doesn't work with the younger crowd.,"We were so tired of going through batteries over summer vacations that we had to try something. When we could get it to work it worked. It was hard for our son to properly place them in there to get them to charge right. After two years of off and on use, the batteries just stopped working. In retrospect I would have bought some kind of rechargeable batteries that I could use with multiple devices instead of having yet another single item electronic device that I have to dispose of."
1,What a pain.,"I bought the for my wii to save money on batteries, in that regaurd it was a good idea but the only way I can get them to take a charge is to unhook the batteries from the cotroller and charge it that way, they dont chare while in the controller."
1,Ours died within 3 months,"While it was alive, we loved it; I was sick of replacing all those double A's! But within 3 months the lights went out and it stopped charging the remotes. While the other reviewers like the product b/c it does something great, if it doesn't last, it's just not worth it. I'm trying to find a comprable product b/c I am sick of all the double A's, again!"
4,The charger is not DOA - need some rework,A lot of people have been experiencing DOA (Dead on Arrival) of the charger and I am one of the pool. The battery is fully charged (green light) but no power on the remote. There's only one reason to this - loose or no contact between the battery and the remote.You can fix this by yourself. All you have to do is to bend the copper metal a little to make the contact to the remote (+).Hope this will solve the mystry of the DOA.
4,Wii Charge Station,Matches the looks of the Wii. Functions well. Very useful to have a fully charged battery when necessary. Comes with two spare batteries.
2,"Nice try, but poor function","This charge station is a nice effort, but functions poorly. The controlers do not seat in the charger well. You have to jiggle them and press them into position *juuuuuust right* for them to charge.Often, that doesn't work either.Given the same challenge, I would buy more rechargeable batteries and forget the concept of third party battery packs."
3,Stopped working on one side after six months,"This was great while both sides were charging, now it only charges on the left side. I thought about getting a replacement today with the gold box deal ($20), but decided it's not worth spending another twenty. Just more plastic for the landfill!"
4,A good charge station,"We were going through batteries for our Wii remotes like crazy, till purchasing this charge station w/chargeable batteries. This really saves you frustration (with looking to see if you have more batteries in the house) and expense. Though the instructions direct you to place remotes on it at all times (when not playing on the Wii system), we actually wait a few days; I just think that prevents from over-charging and extends chargeable battery life in the long run....."
3,this does the job...But,The charger looks nice and has a nice blue light showing when the device is charging and turns green when its charged. The problem is the cradle does not accomodate the sleeve and wrist strap you are supposed to have on the controllers. So the quick charger is not so quick.
5,"Very good, works as it should","Just got it today and so far it's working perfectly. Charged for about 15-20 minutes out of the box before I jumped right into playing and it's been working great.Also pleased it's working with my Wii - Afterglow Wiimote+ I got recently. Had me a bit worried since my older docking station/battery pack didn't work with it, though I'm guessing that's since it's much older and incompatible. (Got it before wii motion plus ever came out, not sure if hardware has changed to make it incompatible or not)"
3,Cheaper to get rechargeables & a charger....,"It's a nice idea, being able to dock the wii-motes have them charge, but the battery packs stop holding a charge after a couple of years and it's not worth replacing them. We have another brand of this device that has lasted longer, but I imagine that its days are numbered as well. Was nice while it lasted and did NOT damage our wii-motes as some reviews have mentioned."
5,Works great,"Not really much to say here - easy to setup, LEDs let you know how well charged the battery is, the new backing/grip for the controllers actually feels nice - all in all a great product!"
5,NO more BATTERIES- perfect!,"The charge station works like a dream and there is no waiting around for the Wiimotes to be ready- it is quick and easy and they hold a charge for a looooong time (we have never had to stop and recharge while playing). We are thrilled not to be constantly replacing batteries so that we are not only saving money, but lessening our personal the impact on the environment. My only hope is that everyone decides to go with recharging- so do it!"
1,Nyko Wii Charging Base - Stay Away,I have gone through 2 of these bases and the prongs on the base that make contact with the controller bend and no longer work. I had the exact same thing happen with 2 different sets. Find another manufacturer.
1,Great But..,"It is great & looks goods while it still works, but what I didn't like it's that it only worked for about A month and a half"
1,"Charging light goes ""green"" too quickly","I love rechargeable battery packs, but either the charger or the batteries that I got seem to stop charging too early. When I start charging on at least one of the packs, the little ""done charging"" light turns green just a few seconds later and stops charging. I checked on my Wii to make sure it was charged, but it is not, the think conks out in less than thirty minutes. That just won't fly for a power gamer like me.Fail."
4,Awesome product with one flaw,"I'm sure that there are some of you out there that bought skins for your remotes. Needless to say, if you buy this unit....they wont fit. I acutally had to cut around the back of the controller in the shape of the battery housing in order to still be able to use my skin grip. It worked out because of the grip on the housing that comes with the unit. But I don't like to cut something that I had just bought. Just keep that in mind though. Every other thing about this unit is perfect. No more buying expensive packs of batteries for me."
5,get a charge,"We keep them plugged in so they are always at optimal charge. Great buy, fast shipping. Thanks"
4,acceptable,"I was a little hesitant to get this since it wasn't the official charger but it does work just fine. I have noticed that it's a little fussy on how the pieces are placed into the charging stand but other than that, it works great. Glad I got it."
1,Some models DO NOT have the groove for the strap!,"I ordered this particular charger after I read tons of reviews that said their product had a small groove to the left and right so the strap would not stick out and make it harder to get the connection to charge. But, when my unit came it must have been one of the older models that do not have the groove. It is my biggest pet peeve about the product, since it makes it teeter in the cradle and sometimes you really have to fiddle with it to get it to connect. If only I had looked through the packaging before I ripped it open, I would have seen if mine had the grooves, and could have returned it and repurchased it until I got one with the grooves.The unit does seem to get a little warm if you leave the controllers on forever after the light turns green when they are fully charged. Easy fix: take them off when they are charged!If my product had the grooves, I would have given this 5 stars."
2,Its a great item.....for about a month.,"I recived this item as a Christmas present last year.It worked great for about a month, and then wouldn't work.The green light that indicated the wii remote was fully charged, would come on but when I tried to play with it, it would be dead.I would not recomend buying this because it will just sit in your cabnet while you resort back to the old fashioned AA's."
1,Junk,"Bought this and one of the batteries would never connect/charge with the unit. I would say we simply received a defective battery except the other battery is hit and miss while charging. And yes, the cord is out of the way. I think I'll stick to rechargeable AA batteries."
1,Charger Cover can be problem,"I liked the ease of use of the charging station but found a real disadvantage. We use the Wii zapper on several games and the Wii remote will not fit into the zapper with the cover supplied with the charger-the contacts stick out too far. So the only way to use the zapper is with the regular cover (skins can not be used either). Have not tried to fit it into the wheel yet so that may or may not work either, so the charging unit has been a disappointment. I hope they can redesign it with other accessories in mind in the future."
2,could be better,"while it is great to have a charging station for the ever-draining wii remote batteries, the charging base is very touchy. You can't just place the remote in the base to charge, It takes several tries to get the remote in the proper place, and any sudden movement will jostle it from being charged"
3,does it have to be so hard to use?,Trying to get the wiimote to sit right on the dock is like trying to get a marble to balance on a slope sometimes. It's such a pain in the neck. But at least it charges the wiimote.
1,Stick to rechargeable batteries,"Initially, I enjoyed the convenience of this product. After a few months, though, the product started to break down, showing it's true quality.For starters, the charger docking station was very finicky. I don't know how many times I had to keep resetting the wii remote in place before it would even think about charging. Also, it would very often, if not always, show a green light for charged very shortly after having placed the remotes in for charging. If that wasn't enough, the cheap plastic grip material on the back of the wii remotes began to peal. Eventually, I accidentally broke the metal contact strips on one side of the charge station. This is actually very easily done if you quickly & angrily place the wii remote into the charging station at a slight angle. At that point I just threw the whole thing away.Quality rechargeable batteries are the way to go IMO."
4,Good Job and Compact,"I've had this about a year now - it does a good job of saving me money with recharging the batteris, and the light indicator tells you if it is charging and changes color when the charge is complete.The only drawback I have is with the wrist straps on the hand held units - they get in the way of immediately placing the units on the charger and have to be placed ""exactly"" right or the unit won't charge; that took some getting used to but doesn't detract from the value of the charging station."
1,Horrible Return Policy,"I ""WARN"" anyone who purchases from this seller.To READ all the return policy on any item you might be considering on purchasing from this seller. I purchased a NEW WII Charger System but when I received it one of the batteries would not keep charge and the snaps on the back WII cover where missing. I have tried to resolve this matter with the seller only to be denied any exchange or refund..""BE WARE"" of this seller..Thank you...Rosa"
1,Terrible Product from a Corrupt Marketplace,"Leave it to Amazon, one of the most corrupt online marketplaces, to sell a crappy product like this. The batteries barely lasted me a couple of months before dying within an hour of being charged. Surprisingly, it is cheaper to just purchase single-use batteries because they last so much longer. The charger is now just gathering dust.Save your money and buy all of your Wii equipment elsewhere. In fact, I wouldn't trust Amazon for any product in the foreseeable future."
1,Doesn't last long around rough kids,"I was able to purchase this as an assecory when I bought my wii. It lasted about two days and then the little metal piece that charges the battery broke off. Another thing is the charger has a Red Led light and when trying to unplug it you cant really look at it, it hurts my eyes. I have three wiimotes and the battery pack doesn't really fit skins because of its ""tight grip"" Another thing it takes a long time to charge and dosent last long. Nyko is an okay product maker. But watch out what you buy."
1,Get Rechargeable AAs instead,"I say you should forget about charge stations! The reason why is because Rechargeable AAs give you much longer playing time, take less time to charge, and there is a lot less chance that they will kill you Wii controller.Also they allow you to keep your skins on your controller. The rechargeable AAs are only a little more money, and they last much longer then the charge stations do!!! Please do not make the same mistake that many other people do!You on average only have to charge the AAs about once a week, instead of everyday to every other day! This is a review from Jesse."
1,buy with caution,"I bought this same model at Wal-Mart, the first one caught fire and burned up, the second one worked fine for a month or so but now only the left charging station will actually charge anything.I'd suggest normal AA rechargables, easier to find parts for."
1,Good idea...poor implementation,"I purchased mine a month ago. After about 2 weeks, one of the batteries went dead (the other worked fine in either controller). I wrote their customer service, and they told me to return it at my expense and they'd send me a new one. They then returned the battery and it still didn't work -- same problem. At the same time, the second battery went bad. Rather than pay more shipping, I just dropped it in the trash. I'm using the stand, just not the batteries..."
2,"Good idea, works poorly","Having had this for awhile now, I wish I hadn't bought it.It has to be on the charger exactly in place to charge, and it never seems to charge them up all the way even if the LEDs change from blue to yellow/amber which is supposed to signal a full charge.Rechargeable batteries would be a better option, though not quite as convenient."
4,Wii Charge Station,"The charge station is great. It keeps the remotes organized and ensures that they are charged at all times. It is slightly annoying sometimes to move the wriststrap out of the way, but that only takes a second, so it is not too bothersome. The indicator lights are great to let you know if it is charging or fully charged. They seem to last a long time too. I have a controller in myGuitar Hero III: Legends of Rock Bundle With Guitarand I haven't had to recharge it for about 15 hours of game play so far."
5,Great Product,"If you're like me and get sick of throwing away expensive, environmentally unfriendly batteries, this is the product for you. I've beaten Super Mario Galaxy on ONE charge, these really are great. In the long run they are significantly cheaper than normal alkaline batteries. Anyone who owns a Wii must have this product!"
1,Stay away from this piece of junk,"Purchased as part of a Christmas gift. Out of the box, one battery showed it was charging when in fact it wasn't. On third attempt to charge battery, battery light stopped lighting up. Returned battery to Nyko. Replacement battery wouldn't charge and then the other battery stopped charging. From reading reviews, it seems this is a very common problem. New batteries are DOA and others just stop working after a short time. I am returning this piece of junk. And I am concerned this piece of junk is a fire hazard."
4,junk,"Have to agree with some others, that this is not worth the money. You have to replace regular batteries every month or so, depending on how much you you play your wii game, but this battery pack is a waste of money because you're going to have to replace them close to the same amount. They lose the charge after several recharges and the charge station has gone out and then come back to life a number of times. Electrical glitch?? Unfortunate. Thought it would be a good save on batteries and waste, but now I just have to toss out this too."
5,Wii Charging Station,"I particularly like this charging station because all you have to do is plug it into the USB port of your Wii Console. There are no other plugs, (ie: AC). I had run out of AC wall plugs, so this feature came in very handy."
1,Worked for 1 charge,"This product worked for 1 charge for 1 of my controllers. On subsequent attempt to charge both remotes, the light turns blue to green within 30 seconds indicating a full charge and despite leaving the controller in for 18 hours, the neither remote has sufficient battery life to turn on the remote. I must therefore side with the other 1 star reviews and recommend that you stick with traditional batteries or rechargeables."
5,Great charger,"Good packaging, the unit is sleek and compact and it does the job nicely! After doing my reasearch I've found that this seems to be the top of the line when it comes to chargers and sure enough it's great quality and I would buy again!"
2,Short lived fun,"When I first purchased this charger, I thought it was the best thing to come out since sliced bread. The greatness however came to an end about 6 months into use when the batteries only held about a half hour charge. As I only play 5-15 hours a week, it would have been cheaper for me to stick with double-a batteries."
4,It's OK but...,"The Nyko Wii Charge Station works well. I got mine as part of a bundle. It charges fairly quickly and the batteries last a decent amount of time.My one major gripe is you have to strip down the controller to put it in the charger. That means take off the rubber sheath and remove the wrist strap. If I didn't have to do all that, then this would have been a 5-Star review."
2,"Good idea, poor quality","Good idea, but it needs refining and quality control.Pros:*Saves you money on batteries*Charges quickly*Rubberized battery covers are better than originalsCons:*Poor quality. One of my batteries completely died after a few months of very casual use.*Can't be used with any kind of skin.* As others have noted, if the straps are attached, you'll have to fiddle around with Wiimote in the cradle to get it to stay charging. It's beyond me why they wouldn't make a channel or something so the straps would stay out of the way.I wouldn't recommend this particular charger."
4,"Great Product, Just Consider the Cons","Pros:+ Rechargeable battery for the Wiimote+ Rubber grip feels nice+ Convenience increased a lot+ CheapCons:- A full charge lasts less than AA batteries- Have to remove silicon sleeve to charge it- Rubber grip makes Wiimote too big to fit in attachments like the ZapperBasically, it's a great product, but just know that the rubber grip battery cover replacements (which are required for it to work) make the Wiimotes too big to fit into peripherals like the Wii Zapper, Mario Kart Steering Wheel and most third-party attachments.As long as you always put the Wiimotes back in the charge base when you're done with them, you'll be good. A set of AA batteries have a longer charge than a fully-charged pack, but then again you don't have to keep changing out batteries (or buying them) if you buy this."
2,Battery doesn't last a bit,I really loved the idea of the charging station because I'm sick of buying batteries every other week. I was dissapointed when one of the batteries stopped working after five weeks of use. Plus when it did work the charge didn't last as long as regular batteries.
2,WiiKid,"This Charge station is well design except the batteries suck. One of my batteries in the first set does not work. I have better luck with second set - both batteries work. However, the remotes always have to be in charger if I don't play; otherwise, they will loose all energy after a day or so. When using these batteries, the remotes kept resync with console - very annoying. I would rather spend money on standard rechargable batties. They work better. You can buy four or five sets for the same cost. These look pretty but don't waste you money on them..."
1,Awful Product,I bought one of these and a battery did not work at all so i called the manufacturer and they said that i needed to pay shipping to send it to them and ten wait 5-6 WEEKS. So I took it to the store and returned it instead and the next one had a defective battery as well. Better off just buying rechargeable AA batteries instead. It's a piece of junk and the company has awful customer service.
3,good idea but contacts are hard to line up,great idea...but you have to jiggle mine to get the contacts to work so that it charges. My kids have trouble doing that
2,Nyko Charge Station,Purchased this as I have a Wii and needed a charging station but when received the product did not work so I had to return
3,Kind of wish I got a different one,"On the plus side, it plugs in directly to the wall socket. On the minus side, it does not fit the motion plus adapter/sensor, which means we have to detach it each time we recharge it."
2,Ehh,"This was great bought for my husband when we were dating, the one side stopped charging after about 4 months and does not work at all now"
2,"Unreliable, Fails within a year.","I was hoping the negatives were just flukes on this one, but alas, no. The first remote started losing capacity with a month. By 3 months one battery didn't work anymore."
5,"Not a game, but a great add-on","If not for this, I would have gone through hundreds of batteries by now. This is a must have for any gamer. Only downside is that skins do not work with this unit. The controller will no longer fit in its slot."
4,Nice Charger.,"The charger works great to not only keep the batteries fresh, but also to give the kids a place to put the controllers when they are finished playing. The strap can get in the way when putting the controller on the charger, but you learn to deal with that."
4,Works great,"Works as advertised.I wish you didn't have to take the sleeves off the Wii controllers, but otherwise this product is great."
5,Wii Charge Station,"I have only had the Wii for a few weeks, but not once have the remotes run out of juice. This charge station has been great."
5,Very Good Product,"I was weary about buying this product, but it is really good. My controllers are always fully charged and that makes gameplay much better. This is a must buy if you have the Wii."
1,terrible,the batteries shake around inside the wii remote and constantly cause the remote to disconnect. Very annoying. Eventually i just switched back to normal batteries
5,Great upgrade.,It works great. We have never had a problem with the controllers being dead and its saving us a lot of money in batteries (which is good for the environment). Even if you play the wii just every once in a while it still seems to drain the batteries pretty fast but this station keeps the batteries charged and ready to go at all times.
2,Great...sort of...,"Of my 2 wiimotes, one works great with this system but the other wiimote will not turn on at all with the rechargable battery. Both wiimotes look exactly the same, and both work fine with regular batteries. This product simply does not work with all wiimotes, and they completely failed to warn me about this before I purchased."
3,Very distracting in darker rooms,"The charging station has one light for each remote in the station. While charging a remote, the light glows an extremely bright blue. If your living room is well-lit at all times this probably won't bother you, but I keep my living room at just above a movie-theater level of lighting (enough to get around without bumping into things, but not enough to be distracting) whenever I'm watching movies or playing games, and those super-blue lights drive me nuts. I've had to move the charging stations away from the TV because of how bright they are. Even my wireless router, which has lights that are continually blinking to show internet activity, is far less annoying.On the plus side, the replacement battery covers are better than the default Wiimote battery covers."
3,useful but don't buy if you use plastic protections,"good product, but annoying if you have to remove every time you need to remove the plastic protection to charge the wii controller with this."
1,busted,"first of all, the batteries never lasted as long as cheap batteries a bought in the store. they were never seen as fully charged after they charged all night. and it broke when my charge station fell on the ground. a one foot drop broke my nyko charge station. my wii fell from a 3 foot height once, it only as a crack to show it."
1,wow....5 minutes was all it took.................,"....to realize these are a P.O.S.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Got home just now to find these on my doorstep. I was excited.I opened the box, opened both chargers, plugged them into the wall, put Wii remotes in the cradles, and 2 minutes later all blue lights turned to green!!!It literally took me 5 minutes to do all of that and these worthless chargers went from blue leds (means charging in progress) to green leds (meaning fully charged) in 2 minutes???? I messed with them for 5 minutes trying to get em to stay blue and actually charge the dead batteries.................NOPE...worthless chargers (or batteries)????.After looking at mostly positive reviews I figured i'd take a chance on these.SHAME ON ME!!!"
5,Great Battery Saver,I had no problems with the charge station. Easy to install battery packs. The remotes rest and charge okay with the safety strap still on. Works great.
1,"Nyko means ""never again""","Once you buy this product you will never again purchase anything made by Nyko.It is complete junk.The first time you put the controller in to charge it is nearly impossible to position it correctly to make contact. The contacts bend and misalign very easily so your second attempt at charging, after a mere hour or so of playing, it will be even harder to get it to charge.Even taking off the wrist strap doesn't make lining up the controller in the charger easier.You can buy a years worth of AA batteries for what this costs AND save yourself a lot of frustration.If Amazon continues to sell Nyko products they should consider allowing zero star ratings."
4,Go ahead and turn on the vibrate feature of your Wii Remote back on,"I love this product; it comes with everything you need to get your Wii Remotes working on rechargeable batteries right away; it even includes good rechargeable batteries and better grips on the battery covers (Awesome). The LED lights give you a status of the charging process so that you know if the remote is charged or not. The price is a lot better than I hade expected.The problem is that the Wii Remote cable gets in the way when the remote is placed in the charger and the charge light is too slow to respond. What this means is my kids go and put t in the charger but it does not always connect and start charging, and if I tell them to wait for the light it may mean they do not wait long enough to see the charge light go on before they adjust it's position on the charger."
1,OK for a while,"The battery pack works for about a half day of playing (8 hours or so) in the beginning. Have had these for several months, rarely used and am really disappointed with the battery life now. Can't even play for 4 hours. I get so much more life using rechargeable AA batteries (definitely recommend getting 2000 mA at least). These can last about a week and you get a pack of 4, serving the same purpose (for two Wiis). And for the price of this setup you can get 3 packs of the AAs or 2 packs with a rapid 1-2 hour charger (definitely recommended), so you always have batteries available and can use the AAs for other stuff."
3,Needs Work. . .,"Nyko is going to be receiving a lot of calls wanting replacements. Good thing this item comes with a 90 day warranty. One battery works fine, the other wont work in either of my Wiimotes. Its a hassle but if Nyko can fix the problem then its worth it."
2,Wii Charger Console,"Dear Amazon,Thanks for sending me my order on time. However I had a hard time putting the rechargeable battery in the Wii controller. Whenever I put that in it gets stuck. I couldn't figure out what I am doing wrong. I followed the instructions in booklet that came along with it."
1,KEEP OUT!!! AVOID IT!!!,This thing just doesn't work.One of the batteries doesn't charge and the other one last 10 minutes.DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
1,Peice of Garbage.,"I bought this at target and when i brought it home i wanted to test it out. I put the controller in and it got stuck, when i pulled it out the metal pins riped right off. Cheap Chinese made piece of junk."
1,doesn't work.,"I'm not the first to say this, and I probably won't be the last, but this product doesn't work.What a waste of money."
2,DO NOT BUY IT it will break your remote and void warranty,"do not buy this or any other kind of wii remote charger where u have a different pack.This product voids your warranty and may break your wii remote. I know from experience. I called nintendo staff and they told me that it was products like this that broke my remote. It also voided the warranty so if i wanted to get it fixed, instead of getting a free repair i had to [ay to get it repaired. If you already have it STOP USING ITThe only type of rechargeable batteries u should buy are the kind were they can only be recharged wehn taken out and put into a spereate charger like DURACELL DIV. OF P & G 18035 RECHARGEABLE PRECHARGED BATTERIES - AAA 4PK"
2,Wii Charge Station,It is very hard to keep the sensors aligned so that the batteries actually charge. I would not purchase this again given the choice.
2,Unreliable,"Placing the Wiimotes in the cradle is extremely finnicky. The blue lights mean it's charging, green when it's ready to go. When I place 2 dead wiimotes into it, it's difficult to get the cradle to accept/read them, then after about 10 seconds of the blue light being on, they turn to green to indicate they are charged, when in fact they are still dead. Going to get a normal rechargeable battery pack with charger tomorrow. Worthless."
2,Really finicky,"We've had this charger several years, and though it does the job it is really frustrating to use. You have to set the remotes just so, or they won't charge. It takes a lot wiggling around, and even when you get them in the right spot for a second, often you let go and the light goes off... and you have to start over again!"
1,Not designed for gravity !!!,I can never get the Wii remotes to sit in this correctly. I have had it for three years just have given up on trying to balance it in the cradle right for it to keep a connection to the back to charge it.
4,Steady power,"We've owned this little unit for 2 years now and it's been fantastic. The units works as advertised and keeps our Wiimotes charged for hours of gaming fun. The only problem we've ever experienced with it is, well, you can't use it with the Wiimote protectors that are shipped with the the Nintendo remotes, so we've just taken them off and don't use them at all. The other thing is that, occasionally, if you don't seat the Wiimote properly on the unit, it won't charge. We have to pull the wrist strap string tightly forward otherwise it keeps the battery from making contact with the unit. Other than that we've had zero problems with the unit or the rechargeable batteries which are still going strong. Highly recommended."
2,Looks nice but....,It's better to buy rechargeable batteries like Sanyo's Eneloop brand because they hold a longer charge. And the Nyko's seem to loose charge a bit to soon even when not in use.
3,"Decent charger, but you probably don't need it","I've owned this for a little over a year now. It's convenient, but there are a few things you should be aware of before buying one:1) You need to remove any protective coverings your Wiimote might have before recharging it.2) The wrist straps sometimes get in the way when you're trying to dock the Wiimote for charging. It's just a minor annoyance.3) The metal contacts on the battery are located where your hands normally hold the Wiimote. One of the contacts on one of my batteries corroded from hand moisture and wouldn't charge anymore. I eventually fixed it by cleaning with salt and vinegar, then using sandpaper to expose the metal again (I think it's copper).Given these inconveniences, I'm starting to wonder whether the ChargeStation is really more convenient than simply buying and using regular rechargeable batteries."
2,Not worth the price,"This item worked great - for about a month. For this price I would expect it to last longer but it has stopped charging the batteris even though the light tunrs green as if it is fully charged (how annoying is that when you go to play thinking the remote is charged & it's not!). My friend has the same system & the same problem so I know it is not a fluke. I suggest buying something cheaper, or as another posted suggested, rechargeable batteries."
1,Broken after 1 year,"The battery pack stopped working for one of the two provided. And we had only had it for one year! One time we used it it complained that one of the remotes had low battery (we figured it was the two that have normal batteries, and replaced those but the message would not go away. ) The next time we tried to play, one of the controllers would not turn on! When we put regular batteries in that controller it did turn on. Thats how we knew it was the battery pack.Also, we always struggled to get the WiiMotes to sit on the charging station just right so that they would charge. The wrist strap gets in the way and prevents them from making a good connection."
4,"A great addition, but a few tweaks away from perfection","I'm much happier with the charge station over endlessly swapping out batteries in the Wii controllers, but there are a few minor tweaks I would make to the next revision:1. Add a groove in the center of the remote cradle for the hand strap to rest. I can still charge with the handstrap attached, but it's a more tenuous way to place the charger in the dock. If I get bored one day a Dremel tool can fix that issue quickly :)2. I don't use skins for my Wii controllers, but apparently they don't work well with the charge station. I wonder if creating the station to accommodate the skins and then having some snap-in sleeves for the naked controllers would work."
5,Great Product,"It works just fine for me. It charges my wii remote quickly and is easy to use. The only thing I hate doing is having to remove the wrist strap and remote cover all the time, but to save money on batteries is well worth it."
1,Doesn't last,"This worked for less than a year, and when it did charge it was difficult to get the connection right. While it did save on batteries while it worked, there was a problem with it from the beginning."
4,Does the job,"Don't try to use this if the remotes have skins on them.Placed carefully on the charger, the rechargable batteries in the remotes are ready to go in a little more than an hour if fully discharged."
2,Meh,"I got this quite some time ago and was wondering why the charger packs were not charging while it was plugged in and the remotes in exact position! There was some problems with some of these chargers that did not charge due to some defect where the little button thing on the station that presses against the charger didn't always make contact with the remote, which seemed to be my case.I dumped it and simply rely on regular brand name rechargable batteries and my Duracell AA/AAA 4 battery charger instead as I did before I purchased this. I only did buy the charger to see if it would have been more convenient but it was more of a hassle to me.Read up on reviews and stuff before switching from a normal battery charger before buying this, because it may be more trouble than it should be."
3,Wii Charge Station,It's good to be able to change the wiimotes with this much ease but they have to be in the exact right position in order to charge. That get's very annoying.
5,Save yourself some money on batteries,This is definately a must-have if you play the wii more than once a week. You will save a lot on batteries and it works well. No complaints here and certainly a good purchase.
4,"Handy, but finicky.",It's nice always having fully charged batteries. Sometimes difficult to get the remote to sit properly and get an adequate connection.
1,"Nice idea, horrible quality","I am not a heavy Wii player. I play it enough to make it worth the purchase, but I am not spending hours a week using the system. With that being said, I do not need to charge my wii motes that often. I bought this because the wii motes chew through batteries and it save me money, hassle, and the environment. Unfortunately, my charge station broke in 2 months. To say that this product is of low quality is an understatement. It really has no quality. Big disappoint, and I will definitively not make the same mistake twice."
1,Charging problems after a few months!!!,"Initially, this looked like the best product in the world. Our Wiimotes were always charged and ready to go. Then after a few months the charger stopped working. Now we have to take the battery cover off and CAREFULLY balance the Wiimote on the base. If the base is jostled at all, they will stop charging. Absolutely horrible!!! I've never had a more difficult time charging any other cradled cordless devices, such as phones and drills. In its current form, do not buy! They really need to make the contacts bigger and better. I prefer it even more if someone just dropped the cradle altogether and allowed a mini-USB charger to charge the battery, like a cell phone!"
2,Works sometimes,"This product is very unreliable. It takes some jiggling around of the Wiimote in the charger to get the ""I'm charging"" light to come on. When the light comes on sometimes it goes green (charged) almost immediately. Swapping controllers in different positions sometimes rectifies this problem, but sometimes it doesn't make any difference. When you can get it to charge the battery life is great, which is the only reason for giving this product a 2 star review instead of 1. Also they might have been able to put the charging contacts in a different place, as they seem to get a little corroded from hand sweat and grime due to intense game play! Disposable batteries are not the answer, but I would seek other options before buying this product."
1,Won't last,Thought this would be a great alternative to continuously changing batteries and it was for about 3 months. It worked for about 3 months and will no longer hold a charge - same thing happened to our neighbors unit. Have had much better luck with energizer NIMH rechargeable batteries.
1,Worse than useless!!!!!!,"The charging station might actually work, however, the Wii remotes I charged with this thing no longer function properly. The infrared signal from the remotes jumps around so much that using them is just impossible. In holding the remotes while trying to use my Wii I can even feel the internal mechanisms sputtering. I was hopeful that if I went back to batteries the problem would stop. THEY DIDN'T! Now, both of my remotes are useless. If there was a rating lower than zero it would still be too high for this product!"
2,Iffy,"If you buy the wii play game that particular controller does not work with this charging system.the controller that came with the nintendo works great, the one that came with wii play has japanese writing on the side of it instead of english and for some reason it does not charge. maybe its just the particular one that I received.I would just spend the cash on rechargable battery station & double A batteries, pretty much the same price and you can use it for anything you want, including your wii controllers."
5,Great charging station,"I've had this charging station for a couple of months and have had no problems so far. The batteries seem to keep a good charge for a long time and it doesn't take that long to recharge. I don't use skins, so I don't have any issues with that. I'm sure it's a lot like my iPod. Can't dock it with a skin on. Anyway, it works well with the Wii wheel. I don't have any issues with it fitting, works great. I keep the charger in my bedroom so my two year old will leave it alone. We had the Psyclone charger before (HORRIBLE!!) and she tore it apart quickly. This has been a big improvement."
4,Great Charging Station!,"great charging station! You cannot charge the remotes while the rubber is still on the wiis, but if you dont use them like me, then it's not an issue. Overall great product and I would definitely recommend."
2,Lasts for a while but then quits,I bought this charger at Wii launch. It work well for a while but now it seems to have problems charging even new replacement batteries. It's disappointing that it didn't last longer. I'm considering trying some other way of keeping my Wiimotes charged now.
1,Don't buy!! The batteries do not last at all.,The batteries last for about 3-4 months and then need replacement. Look elsewhere. Do not buy this junk.
2,Needs better batteries,Very short game play once batteries have been charged a few times. Would not purchase again.
1,Stopped Working After 6 Months,"Worked great for 6 months and then slowly stopped charging. I suspect it is because of the location of the contacts. They are on the back of the battery and sweat from your hands can corrode the contacts. I tried cleaning the contacts with alcohol, but eventually the unit stopped charging."
4,Excellent charger,The charger is great as it is a easier application for the kids to place the remotes in the charger. The only downfall is that it does not plug in to the Wii and does not turn off when you turn the game off.
4,Great for charging with the batteries provided,Happy to save money on the regular batteries. Working fine and the batteries are holding the charge quite good. The only issue I could think of is that you have to take some effort while putting the remotes for charging as the strap comes between the remote and the charging station. Otherthan that it is good to have.
2,low quality,"Poor quality. have to set them in the charger just right because the strap gets in the way. also the charger and batteries suck. a drained battery had the full charge light come on 5 seconds after putting it in the charger. remotes that have been left on the charger for days only have 1/2 charge when removed. don't think I will by Nyko junk again. Lastly, why is the star rating for this review calling it a game?"
4,Okay,Had to play with it at first and it doesn't always charge unless you put them in particularly right but afterwards its perfect.
5,Works great,we have had these for awhile and they work great. No problems. Charge our remotes just fine. I would buy again or recommend.
1,lasted for a few months then just died....,"Was good while it lasted, but after about three or four months of use it just gave up the ghost and stopped working altogether. No idea why, but we tossed it and purchased a different charger. Wish it had a longer life."
4,Very handy!,"As difficult as it was to finally get our hands on the Wii system, we found out quickly that this product was going to be a necessary addition. It was well worth the cost and works well."
5,Great utility for the Wii,"I was waiting for someone to come out with this - I had no interest wasting batteries or dealing with the standard AA rechargeable battery units. This all-in-one device is convenient and works as advertised (I have no problems mounting it for charge like some people, it's pretty straight forward). The added bonus is that the replacement backing of the controllers has a rubberized grip; which I find more comfortable playing with."
1,Nyko charge station nearly ruined my wii remote,"This is the first review I have ever posted; I am writing this that I csn let other people know how poorly this charge station is made. I have used it for three days now and about ten minutes ago I noticed my remote suddently died while playing - strange because the remote had been charging all day. When I opened the back to look at the battery pack, I noticed that the battery was melted and emitting a liquid. You can see melting damage in the back of the wiimote but it works so far. Don't buy this piece of junk - I warned you!"
1,Skip this battery pack - it will cost you in the end,What a bad product. I've been trying to charge the battery packs for 4 weeks now - with little success. I've got one battery pack that gets hot but never charges - and another pack that can only be charged less than half-way. This product is a waste of time and money. You're better off buying rechargeable AA's for your Wii remotes. Skip this product.
1,Never Buy this Product,"The Wii Charge Station Seamed like a good idea at the time we bought it! No more AA batteries being wasted sounded like a great idea. But then after one week of use the first section of the wii remote charger broke. Then later the secound one started to go on the fritz. I can Charge one of my wii remotes sometimes but usually it just turns to green (meaning it is done charging) a secound after putting my remote on. I strongly sugest not buying this product, it is usless and a waste of money. Just stick to the AA batteries!"
1,fuss tear ateing,"This charging system is really aggervating to use. the contact pins andplates,are near the top end of the battery so the contact pressure is nill, you have to constantly wiggle,push,move arround, just rite in orderto make contact,for the light to glow. and everything is opposite,from the first one I bought it had a fan in it and holds the wii. That one works perfect.the contacts are in the lower half of battery, It has more contact pressure.This charger makes it impossable to interchange remotes from one charger to another. I had no need for a charger with a fan. this was the only choice left. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS CHARGER ! unless you have a lot of time to wiggel the remotes, and hope they make contact."
3,Charger's work great!,"These chargers have worked great for our family. Anytime we've wanted to play our Wii, the remotes have always been fully charged & ready to deliver."
3,Not the charger's fault,"We have two Wii remotes, so the double charger should be perfect for us. EXCEPT -- although both batteries charge very well on the charger, only one of our Wii remotes is able to run off the rechargeable battery! The other seems to run on standard batteries only (go figure?). It is still a good base to store both remotes, so I don't regret getting it."
2,Had to return it...,"Good idea but not well done. The right side charger of mine didnt work and had to be returned, both batteries were fine. For the side that did work I had to jiggle the controller a bit to get the light to come on since there was no where to put the strap. Hopefully another comapny will come out with a better product."
5,what a wonderful toy!,"I bought this for my 3 year old son and he constantly carries it around with him. His drawing has improved greatly and it's been fantastic for teaching him the alphabet and numbers. He even practices writing them.We've had it for over a year, and it has weathered many bangs against walls and furniture, and even more times being stood on. I highly recommend this product."
5,"My 3 year old loved it, but broke very fast","It was a fun toy, my girl loved drawing, but every time she leaned on it or a child sat on it more of the drawing area broke and it quickly became unusable."
5,Drawing for the Toddler,"Bought this for my grandson, age 19 mos. He loves it and plays with it almost every day. His parents like it because he can use it alone, and it is a quiet toy! Highly recommend it."
3,"4 stars because my son loves it, 1 star for durability","I gave this a higher rating because my son loves to play with this and entertains him for long periods of time. We have had it a week and it looks like it's 10 years old! It is not durable at all.It already has 2 large spots where the magnetic powder won't come to the surface of the screen and the tip of the pen has broken off leaving a sharp edge. I've had to take the pen away and all that is left are the 3 stampers. The plastic is flimsy and I'm just waiting for the entire thing to crack. I thought the school bus was cute, but it looks like I'm going to have to look into getting the original and see if it's any better."
2,I would not recommend it,"I learned Spanish and Japanese with less audio than this Italian set of CDs. This was not easy for me without any written text to go with it, you really are missing out on the complete learning experience. I purchased a Italian dictionary to see how the words were spelled. It helped. I learned to recognize certain spoken words and phrases, but I had to listen to each CD many times. There must be a better choice. You may have to pay more, but it should be worth it to have a well written book to go with the audio. I don't recommend this product."
3,I should have researched,The frying pan is quite lightweight. I should have researched it better. I have one the same size from several years ago (also WearEver) and I love it. This one I won't love.
4,Good movie,I heard about this movie and wanted to see it so I got it. We watched it and enjoyed it very much.
5,17 Miracles,"17 Miracles is a poignant description of the faith and trials endured by early pioneers. Based on actual journals, I am impressed with the commitment to their beliefs and desire to join their people at all cost."
4,17 Miracles,"I belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day-Saints, so was very interested in this movie. It takes you back to the migration of the Willy and Martin Handcart companies as they trek to the Salt Lake Valley. This movie was realistically done. You can see the suffering of the pioneers as they are nearly starving, losing loved ones, and dealing with the frigid conditions. The acting was quite good, and believable. And the miracles you witness really did happen. It's a very worthwhile move."
5,Two Tissue Movie,"This was a very good dramatic movie... It was more than just a history lesson... There was love and bitter-sweet loss. I saw this in Utah, when I visited in June. My husband, his sister, and I really enjoyed the film."
5,Stays with you for a while after you view it.,"I appreciate a thoughtful movie that stays with you in your mind long after you watch it. It's been days since I've watched it and the accounts of the characters still play in my mind. The emotions of faith, loss, joy, sadness, doubt, fear, love still come back. I cried through much of it - as a new mother with a child the age of a few children in the film.This will be appreciated by any viewer - Mormon ('LDS') or not. I can't recommend it enough."
5,Szy,Please please please put an option to have this movie on Kindle Fire. A wonderful and inspirational movie made from true stories of true pioneers.
5,Great Movie,"Great film, very touching to see the trials that they went through as well as motivational to see their faith and perseverance."
4,Still waiting to receive,I saw this in USA and it was good at the theater. I have not gotten this item from you however. We had it mailed to our daughter in Arizona. She forwarded it on us us in Uganda Africa. We hope to get it soon.
3,Mmmm...,Well it is well enough made.... but a load of old rubbish. The mormons are a massive cult and are teaching non-truth about what's in that book called The Bible. I f one takes the time to read the Bible then ones can see quite clearly for themselves that mormon teachings are man-made.... not of God/Jesus.If you read all what Christ teaches and what the Appostle Paul goes on to further teach The Churches... you can see that The Book Of Mormon and it's own teachings have no place for someone wanting to follow Christ Jesus and His Way... The Only Way...
5,wonderful movie,The best LDS film I have seen yet. 17 miracles has a serious tone unlike other LDS films and the spirit is strong. It is something you expect to be produced by the church. If you are LDS and watch TV at all then you need this movie.
4,Love Celtic things,"I received this ring and put it on right away. I had it on less than a day and I got a green spot on my finger from the solid band on the bottom. It has been a few days and the green spot has gone away. Other than that, I love the design. Wear it all the time. Something that I bought myself."
2,sad disappointment,As a great fan of Conrad I was really looking forward to another book exploring his alternate time/dimension Poland. Unfortunately the first third of the book is a rehash of parts of the last two books and the last two thirds lack the logic and direction of the series. Conrad plays no great part in this book and the action and characters are less developed and of much less interest. I would buy another in the series and hope it was better but this one is not a winner
2,disappointing,"Sadly, this last gasp does not live up to the previous five in the series. Too many pages are spent rehashing what we already know, Conrad himself has been relegated to a back seat, and most disappointing of all is that the author has not outgrown his adolescent compliant-naked-girlie fantasies, but has intensified them to embarrassingly offensive levels. I might give Number Seven a miss if it ever appears."
3,Too much,"The last in the series was a bit of a disappointment to this X-File fan. Anyone who watches that show can guess a goodly part of the conclusion for this series. While the first book, Area-51 was excellent and the second almost as good, I've found each of the following installments failed to meet the mark. Constant reference to the characters as part of the Arthurian legend demeaned their importance to the plot as a whole. Further,the superfluous description of violence also lowered my appreciation of this latest entry. It is a must read for anyone who has invested in the tale to date but be prepared for a less than satisfactory experience."
3,"Lots of blood, less guts and lots and lots of gore","I read the whole series and I'm glad it finally ended. The bloody scenes with Lisa and the removal of her body parts were way over the top.Never did find out exactly what the disc in Mike Turcotte's head is all about.Lots of fun ideas but the whole series could have ""fleshed"" out the characters a bit more and left out so much gore."
5,ALL QUESTIONS ANSWERED: EMIS,"Almost perfect concluding novel to the series. Actually, this is the clearest segment. I never could keep all the aliens straight( oh my! did I give away the secret that there are aliens among us?) since the only annoying thing about these books is how all the allien groups sound the some(start with the letter A).This is the first instalment that I could keep everyone straight. It is very hard to end these types of stories and almost no one does. But Doherty does. He is also very good about keeping his own real name a secret. He won't tell you who he is but he writes that you can reach him at robertmayer.comAlot of excitement and no sex as usual. This book stands alone and you do not really have to read the other books to enjoy it."
1,"Should be retitled ""Chess for Idiots"" but I hear that was already taken","Not idiot in a ""even a dummy can learn chess"" way but the idiot who got swindled into buying this book.The book offers nothing of real value and all the mysticism and Bushido philosophy only serves to distract the user from important stuff (like the real chess books nearby on the same shelf)."
2,An Intriguing Reading but It Won't Improve Your Chess,"This book is quite simplistic and devoid of any strategic learning value to help you improve your games. If you are a beginner and seriously want to improve your chess with easy-to-read authors try Jeremy Silman's ""Reassess Your Chess: Workbook"", Bruce Pandolfini's ""Russian Chess"" describing six games move by move, Irving Chernev's ""Logical Chess: Move by Move"", and of course Aaron Nimzovitch's ""My System"".This Samurai book tells you to ""Seize The Initiative"" as one of their strategies. True, but how to do it requires you to work and practice, and the guidance of good chess authors. -- I give it two stars because of it's inspirational value and innovative idea. It's not a boring read, just not a very useful chess book."
4,A Good Beginners Book on Chess!,"SAMURAI CHESS by Mr. Michael J. Gelb and Mr. Raymond Keene puts things in perspective for the neophyte chess player and gives one a basis of comparison with a familiar theme - the martial arts. I've poured through several chess books which were all too advanced and gave skant attention to a beginner chess player, but as a dedicated Judo and Jiu-Jitsu practioner, I was finally able to absorb some basic chess concepts through this book and the author's ability to draw a martial arts analogy. Yet the only flaw is that the Japanese already consider the Asian game of 'Go' a martial art equal to Karate or Kendo and they give those 'Go' players hard won Dan or Black Belt ratings; and this is hardly appropriate to Western chess, which is, after all, only a game!"
1,"A basic approach to chess, but not a strategic guide","This book will only appeal to the absolute beginner--almost half of its entire content is the basic rules of the game. It presents an interesting method of looking at chess, but it is basically devoid of strategic value. After reading Nimzowitsch's My System, this book pales in comparison."
1,Whimsical Approach: Hard To Take Seriously,"I am shocked that anyone (besides the authors) believes that this book deserves more than one star! I'm not saying Samurai Chess is worthless, virtually no book is totally devoid of value, but there really is no ""strategy"" here that you can't find elsewhere with far analysis and annotations. ""Seizing the iniative"" ""Follow through"" ""Code of Bushido"" etc. I can only shake my head and say that if you like a little mysticism, Japanese martial arts platitudes, mixed with your chess feel free. I'd rather play against you than someone who'd read Vukovic's Art of Attack or Nimzo's ""My System."""
3,Interesting? Yes! Helpful? Maybe.,"No argument from me (ELO 2023) about the ""7 Samurai Principles"" - they seem sound enough. The problem remains: HOW do we translate them into effective chessplaying? Telling us to seize the initiative, follow through, sacrifice to win, etc., is fine - but the players need more help in the clinches. Fun to read but not especially likely to improve your chess."
4,Very Insighful,"This is a very well written, insightful text on our ""prison industrial complex."" As a corrections professional, I am quite skeptical of the constant onslaught of prison-bashing books, citing the various incompetencies and underlying corruption inherent in many departments of correction. Hallinen's writing style makes for an easy read, almost like reading a novel. The book is full of personal interest stories and minimizes the use of statistics. I recommend this book to anyone interested in corrections, and certainly to policy-makers at the state level."
1,Weak,"This is a late arrival in a crowded field. Hallinan say little new and his arguement is wrong. Private prisons are not pushing incarceration. This is safe, middle-of-the-road, off-the-rack hand wringing. Prisons are more complicated than this. Stay away."
2,POOR AUDIO,"I bought the DVD the day it came out and thought that the sound and video quality were pretty poor. I put the disc into my computer and discovered that the sound is in MONO. That's right, single channel audio. It sounds atrocious. I e-mailed Jimmy Franks Recording Company about it and they aknowledged the bad sound and video. They said that the source files from BMG Finland were in bad shape, and Universal Records only gave them a week to make the DVD. Shows how much Universal cares about the band, and their fans. Thankfully their next (new) album will be out on Warner Brothers. Don't buy this DVD and support shoddy products from Universal."
2,Music videos in crackly mono,"I was extremely disappointed with this dvd. Worst sound I've ever heard on a dvd. The sound in the videos is in crackly mono in the left channel. The sound in the Bam parts is ok. Don't buy this dvd unless you're a kid who only cares about watching Bam on your little mono tv/dvd combo. The video sound quality is an insult to the band, I could not tolerate watching them.So if you're interested in the music, not Bam, here's what you want:Look on Ebay. There's an unlicensed compilation with more videos and better sound. The cover photo is a goofy picture of Ville in a Home Alone pose. Just make sure your dvd player can play a PAL dvd. I just finished watching it. The videos are recorded from some foreign channels, but are good quality, and the sound is very good."
5,love it,i love it. i love it. i love it. i love it. i love it. the movie is great. the music is great!
2,NOT IN STEREO !!,"NOTE:THE PRODUCERS RELEASED THIS IN MONO! NOT STEREO!that, and the fact that this is not noted on the product page is inexcusable!!!!this is a dvd music video collection recorded in MONO!"
1,Very Dissapointing - I Reccomend against purchasing.,"Two glaring problems with this DVD.The Video encoding quality borders on amatuer. Terrible amounts of video noise and artifacting. The company that did the mastering of this DVD should be run out of business as they obviously have no idea what they are doing.The Audio quality is terrible. On a good sound system it is unlistenable. Might sound fine on some cheap PC speakers. Again, those responsible should never be allowed to handle Video and Audio again, perhaps McDonalds has somthing they might be good at."
3,a pup named scooby-doo vol 1,"my kids liked a pup named scooby-doo they gave it 3 out of 5, i didnt like a pup named scooby-doo i would give it 1 out of 5"
1,For none technical manager.,"I went through the whole book trying to find usefull information, but infortunately, it's a book filled with definitions. I didn't find any value, or I don't think can bring anything to developer, except may to none technical manager who wants to sound technical.I am a bit annoyed that in 2005 still authors, write books about denitions, without any clear porpuse."
2,Now contains High Fructose Corn Syrup!,"This was a fabulous dressing and very low in calories, however along with many other items, Kraft has substituted high fructose corn syrup for cane sugar. I originally chose this because it didn't have any high fructose corn syrup. Kraft's website says they did it because sugar is too expensive. Well, you've lost one buyer.. I'm sure more will follow once they figure it out."
5,TOTALLY CUTE!!!,"I never use to like My Little Pony until now. I think it's adorable!! Desert Rose has to be one of my favourites. I also recomend Strawberry Swirl, Rainbow Dash, and many more but i forget their names. These toys are WAY better than any other toy on the market, such as Flavas. They look so ugly you could just pull their heads off! They teach children to live life on the street, but My Little Ponies are cute, lovable and fun. Go my little pony!! By the way, i'm 12."
4,Beautiful Heart- felt romantic music,"Alejandro Fernandez's powerfully rich voice makes this album a true pleasure. Though not at all similairly musically, in sentiment, I look at him as the Mexican equivalent to a Marvin Gaye or Otis Redding. A man just singing his heart out about his loves and his women, and is not afraid to show the pain he is feeling. The lyrics are first rate, especially in ""La mitad que me faltaba."" ""Como quien pierde una estrella"" is a rousing number that is great for singing along with friends"
5,DO IT!,This book can change your life - even for only a month if you choose to stick with it that long - but you gotta have will power or you will not complete the lessons. hi carina
4,"Wow, this sauce is hot","I like this sauce... lots of flavor and high intensity. A bottle like this should last a good while. I can't speak for its authenticity since I'm not Jamaican, and my one and only trip to Jamaica was years ago. Considering how I see this brand being sold in more stores and in higher quantities than any other brand I think its probably as close as you're going to get. I love the sauce, and I always make sure I have an extra bottle on hand at all times in case I run out."
1,Not So Great,"Didn't like this product very much. The first time I purchased the product, the seal was broken and everything was leaking out but the company did replace the product free of charge which made me feel better about the purchase. I don't think it is a bad product, but it just was not what I really was looking for."
4,Mmmm... how about 4 1/2 stars for Aux 88,If you have an appreciation for Detroit techno then pick this one up.
2,Not that useful,Could use many more practical examples. All of the reconstruction code included for this book generates incomprehensible images. I wish there was a book that included reconstruction code of actual SAR data with real SAR images so that you can actually tell if you reconstruction algorithm is working and have the ability to evaluate different algorithms on the same data set.
1,shameful,"this way of getting respect is just shameful. yes I am fat and Black and have lots of self esteem but that is not because I am fat.it is wrong to be fat and not do anything but yelling at people about how cool you are. its not cool nor healthy to sweat when you do your shoelaces or go up the stairs. I want to feel free and healthy and jog and party with my daughter. Still this book was good for me because ever since I read it I've been motivated to cut on fatty foods and lose weight.Started from 200 and now down to 183 now and it feels much better, and I don't feel like I'm starving myself. Just running and watching what I eat. This whole book just gives wrong advice and misses the point completely. Sounds too much like fabricated arguments for a bad lifestyle."
2,"Agree with ""An electronics fan from TX United States""",Radio displayed impressive sensitivity for 4 or 5 weeks but after that period only stations with the most powerful signals came in clearly. My Radio Shack version of GE's Superadio pulls in FM stations much better despite its antenna having been snapped off. (No need to replace it)...
3,Poor reception,"This is ok if you just want a cheap, portable radio but the reception leaves a lot to be desired. Many AM stations that are easy to get on my other radios were non-existent on this."
1,Poor Reception,"This radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals. In the fringe area I live in, it doesn't work at all,whereas the little ten dollar Panasonic RF-P50 Pocket AM / FM Radio works quite well."
5,Bang for a couple bucks,"This little guy is perfect! I bought this radio so that I could listen to baseball games and talk radio on my headphones in my cubicle at work. I am thoroughly surprised at the quality of reception that you can get. I'm thinking about grabbing another one to keep around my house.Here's the story - it's small, can run on 4AA's or off a plug, and it has a headphone jack. Are you sold yet? You should be. Darned inexpensive and useful. A purchase that you will not end up kicking yourself over. Oh, the only downside is the antenna - it's not adjustable. It just pulls straight up. With due fairness, however, it hasn't seemed to hurt the signal at all."
5,One of my favorite children's books...,"I am now twenty years old, but from a very young age this book was my favorite. Children of all ages love to use their imaginations, and ""A Hippopotamus Ate the Teacher"" lets them do just that. The portrayal of the adventures of a Hippo teacher and her students will make you laugh and wish you had a hippo for teacher (but only for a while because its hard to sit on a hippos lap)."
2,Didn't care much for it,"Nothing personal, but I didn't much like this one. Just didn't see anything special about the performance, the performer, or the material."
2,Doesn't work!,"I tried to get this product to help teach my two cats to stay out of my bedroom. Not only did they GO INTO the bedroom, the actually seemed more interested due to the new smell. The company itself had extremely slow mailing service, so by the time I recieve the product, it was of almost no use in the training process. All in all, it was a very disappointing experience."
1,It just didn't work,We recently moved into a new house and our cats started urinating in the corner of our livingroom. We had the carpet cleaned then I didn't want them to start going there again soI used this- they didn't care and promptly went right over to the spot and starting doing it again.I also tried using it to keep them off the sofa- didn't work there either.I didn't want to give it even 1 star but there were any other choices
5,"Luscious pictures, delicious recipes","This is a very thorough book, so there are berries here that you might not know about. There's a separate section for each of 18 different kinds of edible berries. Each section has its own recipes. And there are 13 sections about inedible, ornamental berries.Plus, there is ample information about designing, planting and cultivating a berry garden, and preserving, drying and storing berries. Also, there's ample information about finding and harvesting wild berries and finding sources concerning berries.Buy this book and you'll know your berries."
1,Not What I Expected,"I'm glad the other reviewer found this book useful, but I'm afraid I didn't. I found the author's advice simplistic and naive. She seems to believe that a simple resolution to have only nice thoughts about oneself will drive out self-doubt and self-criticism, and that resolving to improve one's social skills is the same thing as actually doing it. (How the reader is supposed to identify these deficits specifically enough to eliminate them, with no feedback from others, is another story...)If this approach worked as well as she seems to think, then why do most people struggle to keep their New Year's resolutions?Again, I'm happy the book helped someone, but it didn't help me."
4,"useful, but a workbook cannot do everything","I found the workbook useful, sensitive and clear guide. However, not all problems are solvable by self-help workbooks. Relating lonliness to one's own person is appropriate. Recent work by Dr. Katherien Fiori of the Max Plank Institute suggests that lonliness has a genetic component - it is the common lot of humanity that merely winning friends and influencing people is not enough. As a chaplain, I find the only fulfilling response to lonliness is a spiritual awakening."
3,men and women aren't the same,"I agree with R. Ryan. This book does give some very helpful advice, like paying attention to the people around you, and needing a mental makeover for relationship, etc. BUT, the author gives the same advice to both men and women, when these two groups are totally different (that's why we have books like ""Men are Mars and women are from Venus""). This is an anti-Rules book, but went too extreme to the other end."
2,Don't waste your money,"This book sucks, don't waste your money. It's about ten paragraphs thinly stretched into 200 pages of fluff. For example, the chapter ""Your Physical Makover"" basically says to find someone with good fashion sense to advise you. The chapter ""Blind Dating"" simply says to go on blind dates! I expected more detail on starting a conversation with a stranger, but the best he can come up with is a few paragraphs with gems such as ""Hi, you're beautiful"" or ""Say, that's a nice bracelet.""Despite his frequent boasting about being a high-paid dating consultant, he is no more insightful than your mom.For guys, I would recommend ""The System"" by Roy Valentine. Even though it is dripping with sleaze, he actually goes into quite a bit of detail as to how to start a conversation with a stranger without wallowing in cheesiness."
3,This book is ideal for men!,"I think there is a lot of useful advice in this book but Wygant thinks he is going to de-program human biology simply by telling women to ask men out on dates, and asking men to accept dates from women who ask them out.On top of that he asks men not to be intimidated by women who earn more bucks and who are a lot more successful and ambitious than they are. That's like asking a zebra to lose its stripes or a bee to put away its stinger! It's not going to happen.My experience is that men like to be admired and respected and have a woman be wowed by their actions. A woman pursuing a man doesn't really allow any of that to happen.You can't change biology. Sorry!But hey, other than that, the book is great."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"Don't waste your money on this book. Most of the information are not practical at all and the other information is stuff you already know. If you are ""beginner"" to the dating scene or just plain clueless about the meeting people, it might be little helpful; but, I highly not recommend this bok."
2,"great inspiration for social life, but women should be cautious about using this book...","I enjoyed this book greatly for it really inspired me on how to improve my social life. My advice to women out there: don't use this as a dating book because the main idea here - asking men out, won't work if a happy relationship is what you want! Sure the guy would go out, why not? But he would take it for granted even if he's a great guy. That's just human nature. I've seen women asking men out, and these women always end up doing all the work in their relationships. This book is a great read if you want to expand your social life - always talk to strangers for friendships. But LADIES, for romance, be smart about applying the techniques here."
1,Utter nonsense,"So apparently to be a real man... I'm supposed to have a wardrobe that costs my yearly income, not have facial hair, run off to the nail salon every few weeks etc... was recommended this book by someone and it was a complete waste of my time and money. Great if you are some six-figure earning metro-male, but for the every-man... worthless."
3,Always Talk to Strangers: 3 Simple Steps to Finding the Love of Your Life,"I think this book ""Always Talk to Strangers: 3 Simple Steps to Finding the Love of Your Life"" is ok. I am trying to read it all. It is about how to meet a woman for date."
2,Author portrays weak female character,"I was intrigued by the story, but sad to hear the author assume a stereotypical weak female role. Her story was only a tale of a rich couple learning to live without their accustomed wealth. If you're interested in being shocked and awed over the ""way Alaskans live"" this will be the book for you. If you're looking for a good book on the Yukon Quest...keep looking."
3,Nice survey,But there are better books on the topic. Useful reading for pointers to further reading.
2,Oscillator Circuits & Projects,"This is a basic 'seat of the pants' design manual. Useful for building up a demonstration circuit, or as an overview of the topic, but not 'meaty' enough for those who wish to gain something greater than a rudimentary understanding of oscillator theory.For those who want to design a simple op-amp oscillator, this book is fine. The RF oscillator descriptions are at best, anemic.Kamichik has done a wonderful thing with the book however, by providing problems to work (at the end of each chapter) AND SOLUTIONS TO EACH OF THE PROBLEMS at the end of the book. These problem sets (along with the solutions) are enormously helpful to the uninitiated.While I would not recommend Kamichik's work as a great reference for high-performance oscillator design, I would recommend the book for those who are completely unfamiliar with the topic, and wish to learn how oscillators work."
1,Obvious ways to celebrate your friends,"(Please note that this review refers to the deck: 52 Ways to Celebrate Friendship. I notice some of the decks in the serires seem to have reviews for other decks.)The 52 Deck Series has some great decks (esp. Great Cheap Dates), but unfortunately, this one is a dud. The suggestions are repetitive (Friendship Scrapbook is pretty much the same as Friendship Album) and generally obvious (did you know that electronic communication tools can help us stay in touch with faraway friends?!!!). The problem with these decks is that you can't flip through them to see if they are a waste of money before you buy. In this case, caveat emptor -- it's not worth it."
4,Cute and funny!,This is a fun little book which would make a great gift for any adult woman who doesn't want to grow up! Jacquie Schmall reminds me a bit of a live-action Maxine!
4,modle railroading,this book answers a lot of questions. Its very imformative. well writen with lots of pictures. explains things that a person that had never really thouth about. I enjoyed it.
5,HO railroad from start to finish,"This is an excellent book showing how to start from the very beginning to build your own railroad. Very helpful, easy to understand with pictures and diagrams. Great basic training and resource for parts and accessories."
5,Jerry's Magia,"I absolutely love this CD. I had it when it first came out but unfortunately, the CD was unplayable (scratched, etc.) I recently purchased it again and brings back so many memories.."
5,BETTER THAN EVER,"This was my daughter's first View Master and she was captivated by the pictures. It is a great toy for travel as well as something to have in the bag when you are in a more confined setting such as the doctors office or grocery store line. My only drawback is that I would like to see them make the reels more durable. Other than that this is a great ""multi - use"" toy."
1,"Does NOT Fit, AGAIN!!!","Here we go again... Ordered a new size and too big again! So much for returns as for when the dog took it off himself, he chewed the strap! Not a purchase I would ever do again! Not even for the right size, which they do not explain in MEASUREMENTS but in breeds of dogs! Extremely upset with this product."
3,...,"I liked the plot, but the story between Irish and Amy was more sweet than anything. I had the impression that it would be a little sexier. It was hard to believe. But it was nice nonetheless.The story between Sally and Dustin grossed me out. They were first cousins, for God's sake."
1,"Should be titled: ""Self-important egotist who vaguely understands sports""","From the hackneyed first chapter to the humdrum and boring conclusion, the ink on these pages would be better used tatooing Caple's self-obsessed love letter to himself across the shaft of his personal miniature baseball bat. Get out of the business, you hack: you don't belong."
5,Damn Yankees,"There are not many books that can make me laugh out loud. This book is so funny that I think if Jim Caple gets tired of being a sports writer, he could be a stand-up comedian. Make no mistake, the author did his homework as the book is fact filled and delightfully biased. A must read for any baseball fan who likes to root for the underdog."
1,typical red sox garbage,"This guy makes me laugh, he actually wasted the time to write an entire book about a baseball team he hates. This is nothing more than the typical, and unhealthy I might add, red sox venom toward their hated rivals. They try to convince themselves its OK because everyone hates the Yankees, if they took their horseblinds off they'd realize the rest of the league doesn't look all that much more favorably on their second highest paid 'underdog' red sox team. Congratulations to the man who wrote this and the people who read it, well more to the ones that read it. You just wasted $12 to read about stuff im sure you already knew since your (baseball) lives revolve more around hating the yankess and being the underdog everyone loves than just appreciating a good team. The guy who wrote it is actually pretty smart, he's making a lot of money off jealous red sox fans who will actually buy anything that reads ""yankees suck"" or something similar."
5,So Wonderful.,"I found this book to be very passionate, but more than that, the setting is beautiful. It is a very good story and a joy to read. I place it way up on my list of top reads of late along with Kenyon's Fantasy Lover, and Anything, My Love by Cynthia Simmons. Also enjoyed Beyond Seduction."
2,Could have been better,"This book didn't read well for me as either fantasy or romance. It starts out with a great premise, a sorceror bound by a demon is given a woman by his brother the king, and only she can redeem him. Unfortunately I think the romance took a back seat to everything else that was going on. Not only were most of the characters' thoughts and feelings not addressed, the heroine was basically a pawn who did no more than get moved about so she could be at the right place for subsequent scenes. That made the book lack depth for me.I was also disappointed by the lack of feel for time and place because I was really looking forward to a new romance setting. The book felt like could have taken place almost anywhere and any time before the Renaissance.So while the story worked OK as a romantic adventure, I didn't feel that it lived up to it's potential."
5,SMASHING!,"What a wonderful gift to the world: Wallace and Gromit. Those of us who have been fans for years have known this for a while. Know the whole world will know. The films is a blast. The soundtrack brings that blast home (well, at least until the DVD comes out; and, even then it'll still be great to wash the dishes or mop the floors to this CD). The music brings back all the fun of the film. I can't help comparing this CD to the last animated film soundtrack CD I bought: The Incredibles. While the music for the Incredibles was good, it was terribly derivative, borrowing too freely and too often from the Bond movies. Nott has not (no pun intended) fallen into that trap (again, no pun intended . . . see the film). This music is fresh and original . . . of course, the Wallace and Gromit theme insinuates itself several times, but we wouldn't want it any other way. Buy this soundtrack."
3,OK - but not great.,"This was installed by the dealer when I bought the car as I would not have a car without XM. Unfortunately, the car manufacturer did not offer XM until the 2009 models. Generally the unit works well and reception is good except occasionally in the mountains. However, there is one big problem with the unit. The output through the FM modulator is way too weak! Volume is barely adequate when turned up to the max. Then, if you switch to CD without adjusting the volume there is a huge blast. It is better than no XM but not really a quality product."
1,XM Commander Disappointed!!,"I had my commander installed professionally at Curcuit City. However I lost reception of some of my favorite AM and FM stations. I had the older model Commander and the module was more powerful, per Curcuit City, and I did not have this problem. I am going to attempt to return it. It is going to cost me additional money for installation approximatelty $100.00. I am very disappointed with this commander."
4,great unit,"I had the XM Commander professionally installed. At this time for my car the only option was with the FM Mod. The sound quality is good, as any FM station is. A unit worth installing.Only a few intems could be improved.First, the display unit could have a scrolling option so that in some cases you can see the entire group or song name. Maybe a smaller size font could be used.Second, the buttons on the display unit are so small that it is hard for full size fingers to find the correct one. The remote works wonders in this area.Third, the tune select could be set up so that you could select the artist or the song. As it is if you select a tune it is that artist and that tune.Overall I would certainly purchase the unit again. Well worth the money."
1,CD Jammed within 10 minutes of use,"When I received this stereo I was a little disappointed that it didn't have an auxilary input so I could hook my VCR up to it. I decided to open it anyway. I put a CD in the CD tray. It was a little dark in my room, so I wanted to see what track the CD was on. I lifted the CD player like 2 inches. The CD in the player slid out of its tray and jammed the machine. I am returning this product, minus one of my favorite CDs"
2,Whose History?,"This book has many clever and interesting arguments and will be thought provoking for anybody who reads it. However the book seriously misrepresents or misinterprets some of the philosophical figures it covers. Misinterpretation by itself is not a sin. But what is objectionable about the misinterpretations here is that they seem to come with an almost total ignorance of some of the best, most meticulous historical research on the figures discussed in the book. The author might claim that meticulous historical research is not his goal. Rather, his goal is to present a certain unifying picture and teleology for the history of analytic philosophy. But these two goals are not necessarily mutually exclusive (though they might be in fact, in which case so much the worse for teleology). Whether or not you think teleology has a place in history of philosophy, surely you must agree that good historical research does. And such research is just what this book is missing."
2,"beautiful but not ""pro""","this weather station is fine, and it is very sophisticated, but what about its usefulness?: the sensors ranges are very very short, and not what we can wait from a ""pro"" weather station. I live in a country land without any interference but the simple stones of my house's walls are sufficient to stop the signal. Very deceiptive item.Laurent from France"
3,mostly works,"Since I live in hurricane prone FL, I thought this would be ideal for us, and bought it primarly for the anometer. Although it mostly works, and the touch screen is really cool, we get inaccurate wind readings.My husband had to raise it from 15 to 30 feet off the ground to get more accurate readings. All I know is that I know the difference between a 15 mph and 30 mph gust, and without raising it very high, you will not get the precise reading you are looking for.If you are buying this for the wind speed anometer, you need to get it as high as you can, otherwise, it's worthless."
4,"Akataka, a amazing new sound","Akataka's lushly layered instrumentations and swirling vocals creates a beautiful encounter with sound, vibration and spirit. There is a mystique and a haunting, personal quality to many of the tracks. The lyrics are vague allowing the listener to attach their own meaning to the songs. I think my favorite is Pure. The ethereal nylon guitar grabs me every time. I sense this is just the begining for Akataka, which is good news for us!!"
3,Still good - but it's not the old Nance's!,"I have loved Nance's mustard for 50 years, but the last case I got had a different taste and it just isn't as good as the original. I don't know why they changed the recipe but they need to go back. Remember ""New Coke"", they went back and I hope Nance's will do the same !!"
5,Great product,I used this product on my Poodle and Shitzu to detangle their fur and it works great. It's too greasy to leave in therefore I use it prior to shampooing and then just put on a little for shine after their baths.
1,Very Disappointing,"While covering a wide range of topics, it does so in an extremely basic manner, and even then, with very brief, and relatively poor explanations. In fact, so basic is the coverage that it is unlikely to be of use to anyone who buys it - people who buy a book such as this are likely to already have a certain degree of knowledge on the topic."
3,"Well, it's better then Enya...","Shinedown has more potential than most new bands that I have heard in the last few years. The lead singer (Brent I think his name is) is absolutely phenominal. His potential is close to matching that of Chris Cornell (an extremely bold statement). The band is very musically talented. On this album the songs are lacking in flow, if that makes any sense. The sounds are often mismatched and most songs are lacking. Buy their first album and if a buddy has this one, burn it."
4,intircate and mature,"Shinedown's new album is an obvious departure for LAW, however it is till a solid effort with good musicianship and powerful, emotional vocals. I do agree with many others that it is softer and more mature, but I do not agree that the songs are poor to average. The songs are still catchy, melodic songs with well devised hooks and bridges. The lyrics definitely are more positive and intorspective than Law's. Give it a few listens prior to judging."
4,Great 2nd CD,It took me a few listens to really get into this CD..however once I did I loved it..especially Beyond the Sun..All together I would have to say its a great sophomore cd and well worth a listen.
3,listen up,"this is at least a 3.5 album I share the dissapiontment of others about the softer change, but to say that it is trash is crazy, a band can not keep putting out the same album every time, when alice in chains put out jar of flies it was a lot slower than we had heard from them before, but yet it turned out to be one of their many great albums, if shinedown can bring back more edge in album 3 then this album is deffinitly worth owning, if not then I too would agree that this was the begining of the end"
2,A disappointment...,"I bought this cd in hopes of it being better than ""Leave A Whisper"", but I am grossly disappointed. Overall the songs are just plain bad and the vocals need alot of work. Brent Smith should refrain from doing acoustic songs like ""Shed Some Light"", especially after he butchered ""Simple Man"". However, I will not be totally negative. There are a few of songs on this album that are decent and that rock, including ""Save Me"", ""Yer Majesty"", and ""Trade Yourself In"". I wish I had not bought this cd.I rated this cd with two stars. I gave it one simply because everyone deserves at least one and another for it being a ""rock"" album."
1,looking down on shinedown,"Shinedown aren't a good band to me personally. The fact that their main sound is similar to Alice In Chains, except much friendlier atmospherically and commercially, doesn't do much to win me over either. It's basic appeal-to-the-masses commercial rock at its very core. The band needs to reach within their musical abilities and find a creative direction to have a chance of winning me over in the long run. For now, that's not the case, and I'm highly disappointed in the band. Creativity is the key for personal success. These guys aren't doing anything about that."
1,You shouldn't have to listen to a CD more than once to like it,"I LOVED Shinedown's first album ""Leave a Whisper"" like every sane person should. But I have to say this new release is garbage. I bought it the day it came out and listened to it on the way home in the car, it started out decently but after a while I had to take it out because the songs were so horrendous compared to the HARD rock in ""Leave a Whisper"". Now, some little sissies have been saying ""Oh, it's a little different, you just have to listen to it like 500000 billion times before your ears stop bleeding and then you relize it's a good CD"" These people obviously fell VERY hard on their head when they were young. Don't give a band too much credit just because they had a great debut. So go buy ""Leave a Whisper"" not this trash. If you want music like this listen to the Dave Matthew's Band or Coldplay, not Shinedown."
1,I THOUGHT SOUNDGARDEN BROKE UP?????,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS I HAVE HAD WHEN PURCHASING CD'S. I LOVED THEIR FIRST ALBUM WAS GREAT BUT ""US & THEM"" JUST SOUNDS LIKE A SOUNDGARDEN RIP OFF. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
4,The best song on the album isn't on the album!,"I bought Shinedown's new album yesterday from Best Buy and a CD single was attached to it. I listened to the album, which was alright, then popped in the CD single, ""Carried Away"" and loved it. I am surprised that this song wasn't on the album because it really is a great catchy tune and, in my opinion, the best new song they have. Don't buy the album without this song or you will really be missing out!"
5,great!,"I`ve got more than 1800 rock cds, so when i say that something is great just go and buy it. One of the best rock albums for 2005."
4,2nd album from Shinedown is a good one,"The 4 man group from Jacksonville, FL return with another good album, despite what some of the people say, yeah it's not the classic their first album was, but it's still a good one. Like the first album, short with only 12 songs, 1 is almost a classic, 5 are ok, and the other 6 are good, none are bad songs. It has more slower tempo songs then the first but still a couple of the more upbeat ones. Don't expect a repeat of ""Leave a Whisper"" but I'd still recommend picking this one up.#2 - 9.5 (my favorite on here)#3 - 8#4 - 7.5#5 - 9#6 - 8.5#7 - 7.5#8 - 7#9 - 6#10 - 8#11 - 8.5#12 - 8.5#13 - 7check all my reviews"
3,Good,"I like their albums on either side a bit more than this one. It does have some great songs on it but it didn't flow as a whole to me. That's just me and I really like the band so I will listen to the album, I just like their other efforts better."
3,Avoid the deluxe edition!!,"I specifically shelled out $23 to get all the ""extras"" touted on the Shinedown website... what a load of crap!The $13 extra dollars bought me three additional tracks on the CD, a poster and some stickers (oh... wheee!!!). The website is pathetic. It's the only place you can get new pix of the band (or even old ones), and yet all you get is a couple of wallpapers, mostly of the album cover...yawn!!! and one lousy pic of the band from the ""Save Me"" video. Apparently no one had a camera anywhere near these guys during the past year? Riiiiight....Recap: $13 extra dollars buys you 3 songs and some useless crap. Buy the regular version and save yourself some $$$."
2,Dull,"After appearing with a wonderful first album, UAT sounds very dull. There aren't any songs that really pop out at you. I would suggest borrowing a copy, but not buying. I personally only liked Shed Some Light and Save Me. But that's about it."
2,this is not good,shinedown shouldnt sound this bad.....it like they didnt put any effort toward this album..they thought because they had alot of record sells on the first album..that they dont have to put as much in to this album because they no we would buy it...all i no is that if they put out another album..ill make sure to listen to it before i buy it....shinedown let me down on this one
2,WTF HAPPENED!!!!????,I am confused. What the hell happend here. Leave a whisper is one of the best modern rock albums you can buy. I was so excited when this album came out..........then i listened to it. The only reason this gets two stars is because there really is only a couple of decent songs. And when i say decent i mean mediocre at best.I will be the first to say i am a shinedown fan but this album has me wondering if they have completely re-vamped thier sound. The music is very basic and the lyrics dont even flow with the sound. Its almost like listining to retards singing to polka music. C'mon guys pull it together. Hopefully this is just a sophomore slump. TRY AGAIN SHINEDOWN.
3,"Wow, an album full of filler","Talk about a letdown. After buying their first abum on the strength of the three singles and thoroughly enjoying the whole album, I was expecting a lot more from these guys on their follow up. It's still the same style of blusey rock, but there isn't a standout track on the album. Unfortunately, the sophomore slump is in full effect here."
2,Sophomore slump is an understatement!,"For months and months I have been anxiously waiting for this album. Although I was hoping that this band could avoid a slump it happened. I will agree with one of the first to review this disc it is weak! I felt like I was revisiting St.Anger all over again. There are no memorable songs on this disc period! The song writing is less than average and for some unknown reason Brent's voice ever so weak on this album, there are moments when I just feel as though he is struggling to stay in pitch. I just saw Shinedown in concert Oct,02 05 in Hidalgo Texas and they stole the show, but this cd is horrible. I hope that they make it though because i do believe that Brent can carry this band if need be. But I too would suggest a buyer beware, please borrow before purchasing this cd is really not good."
5,Awesome album,"After Leave A Whisper, I thought Shinedown had a tough act to follow. To my surprise, this one is even better than the first. If you like their first release, you should love this one. I don't know how some of these people can say it is not as good..."
1,Switchfoot wants their CD back,"This CD is an amazing disappointment after the fantastic ""Leave A Whisper"". The songs on this CD bear absolutely no resemblence to those on their debut, almost as if this were a different band altogether. Also, its not as if the songs on ""Us and Them"" are simply softer versions of those from ""Leave A Whisper""; they're totally different. I have no problem with a band modifying it sound, but these songs are just plain bad. Also, I don't get the appeal of the track ""Save Me"" because it sound like a Switchfoot reject.Skip this useless waste of money. If you like LOA, I strongly suggest that you check out Cold's new CD ""A Different Kind of Pain"" rather than this."
3,just stay awhile...,"...then go on to find something that is actually good. I mean, I'm a fan of Shinedown, thanks to the albeit overplayed hit Save Me (which isn't an original song in the first place), the best song on this CD, but when I got it, there really wasn't much else to listen to, besides Beyond the Sun, my favorite track. I listen to this CD only for Save Me, which coincidentally, is the only reason I choose to keep this CD and not use it for target practice..."
4,one of the better sophomore slumps...,"the wait is finally over and shinedown has released there second cd entitled ""US AND THEM"". theres a few ups and downs about this cd. one of them being that half the cd is good and the rest of the cd seems like they just rushed into it. (they started recording in april of this year). im sure if they took there time and recorded more songs this would be a great album. this doesnt nearly top leave a whisper which was a great cd and i do give it 5 stars. to the guy below me audioslaves out of exile is one f#king amazing cd so if u dont like it then f+ck off. the best songs are heroes, save me, i dare you, lady so divine."
4,Town to Town is fantastic,"I must first admit that I do not have this repackage CD; of the three albums represented, I only have ""Town to Town""; hence I give this product only four stars out of my lack of full knowledge.That said, ""Town to Town"" is likely worth buying the set for. This relatively obscure album from Keaggy's catalog has some of the most interesting musical sounds and arrangements I've heard from him. Many of the lyrics tend to go along with the theme indicated by the title: life on the road as a musician, missing your family and your home.It does have a rather distinct ""early 1980's"" flavor, which I actually rather enjoy, but know that some people aren't fond of it. If you don't mind that, this is definitely worth a listen."
1,May be not the worst book I have ever used,"We had this book as reference for our graduate level Radar course. For those who are not a master in radars already, the word ""Horrible"" would be a close description for this book. I 100% disagree with ""dargo2001's"" review. This book is far from being useful as an introduction material. The writing style indubitably makes the otherwise not so hard concepts (which I later realized from another book) seam indescribably esoteric.If you are a beginner to Radars, I suggest borrowing this book from somewhere and going through it, and I guarantee, that you will not buy it. My very sincere advice is, get ""Matlab Simulations for Radar Systems design"" or any other book from ""Mahafsa"" and you would be pleasantly delighted by the fascinating world of Radars and in the end way more knowledgeable."
4,very thin,"this knife is very thin, I think keeping it in hand wouldn't be easy. but the quality and colour is awesome."
4,Good rock n roll/pop! Great live band!,"I saw these guys win the Discmakers award in 1997 at Tramps in NYC. As a fellow musician, they blew my hubbie and me away.""All Fell Out"" and ""Valetino Dancing"" are my fave cuts. To see them live is a treat.I highly recommend this album.www.greatclassical.comclick on indieSpiritease"
3,Dissapointed with Amazon!,"While I love the songs on these 3 CDs...I am not pleased that there was no reference to the fact that discs 2 and 3 are instrumental, and not vocal. So if you're hoping to ""hear"" the words, and not just listen to the music, this would not be a good choice...my rating isn't so much for the CD itself as it is for Amazon for not making that clear."
3,Million Word Crossword dictionary,"avid crossword doer and so far anything i have looked for has not even made the pages of this book. being a crossword book i find it surprising that i still have to refer to my thesaurus for answers or even lead in to answer, i give three stars as a generous rating. halfway tempted to delete the product."
2,Million word crossword book,"Not happy, may have million words, but not the words I need for my crossword puzzles. Million WordCrossword Puzzle book sucks."
1,The Million Word Crossword Dictionary,"Let this be a warning to read ALL of the small print before purchasing this book for a Kindle. It cannot be used for looking up words! I did not read it all and have paid the price. While this may be great in paper form it is of absolutely no use on a Kindle. I am extremely disappointed. It was my fault in reading only the rave reviews, however, I still feel as though I have been ""ripped off"". Buyer beware!"
5,Crossword dictionary,This is a great & larger than I expected crossword dictionary. It is filled with a lot of information I didn't think would be included in this type of book. Well worth the money in my opinion.
4,About time,"Fantastic! I love that it is a hard cover and a farely recent publishing. I had the NYT crossword dictionary but it was very outdated and I had the newest release!Plus it was paperback so it fell apart instantly with how often I used it. I had 6 separate pieces to go through by the end.It also puts # of letters before each ""answer"" instead of a nonstop list like the NYT, which is fabulous.It has it seems ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING you need to answer the NYT puzzles. It is almost too thorough, BUT I would not want it any other way.I did not give it a five because it does not have the thumb spots that start each letter like a regular old Webster does. If one comes out soon with this extra I would buy another and I just bought this one a few months ago."
5,"generally, the only book needed","Since my sunday afternoon group acquired the Million Word Crossword Dictionary, we have used few other books. Much of the information could be obtained from internet exploring, but we enjoy the feel and use of books at our round table!The introduction by Will Shortz gave me the assurance that this would be a great resource, we can attempt the puzzles with our own wit, but this book prevents us from being outwitted!"
4,NY York Times Help...,"after years of not working the crossword puzzles, recently retired I thought I'd tackle them again...my ""old"" dictionary was an antique so I purchased this one...so far I've been delighted with how much it does help me with my N Y Times puzzles...."
2,Confusing but loaded w/ information,"This book is huge. It's the size of a large dictionary in soft cover.I used the ""A to Z Crossword Dictionary"" for years & thought I'd try this since I was familiar with the author. It has phrases, the beginning of Phrases, the end of phrases, parts of words, and is confusing to look up anything since sub-titles can go on for pages! It's crazy and defeats the purpose of working (thinking) a crossword puzzle because one can look up the answer to just about any clue.""A to Z"" is the size of a normal paperback novel, easy to handle & doesn't give ALL the answers. My problem now is where to put this book that is the size of a large dictionary with a soft cover that won't last too long.I don't recommend it."
4,The Million Word Crossword Dictionary,"I bought this for my 87 year old father who is an avid crossword puzzle junkie. His old dictionary was not current enough for the newest slang or movies and actors and awards. Although this was currently published in 2004, he has already found it immensely helpful and was astounded at the list of academy award entries. He uses it daily. Although I found the print to be small and hard for me to read, he has not complained about it, nor does he wear glasses. I bought the hard back so it would last longer. Some people don't like the larger book but my father prefers it. Go figure."
2,The Million Word Crossword Dictionary,Response time VERY slow. Can't find clear step by step directions. I've had my Kindle Fire for about a month and still can't figure out how to use this book. I'm sorry I spent the money.
4,Works like a dictionary on Kindle!,This book works like a dictionary on kindle. You can type in the word and find numerous words. I do not give it 5 stars because it has not always provided the word I was looking for. All around good crossword dictionary but was very expensive.
5,Million Word Crossword Dictionary,"This is a great companion for crossword puzzle fans, one of which I am. I have only not found three words I have looked up out of hundreds. If you like crossword puzzles this book is a must."
5,A comparison between dictionaries,"I decided to share screenshots of the word ""kindred"", as seen on the Kindle, forMillionThe Million Word Crossword DictionaryOxfordOxford Dictionary of English, 2nd EditionMerriamMerriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th EditionWordnetWordNet 3 (largest English dictionary and thesaurus)Visit the product links to see how the pages look for each dictionary.At the top corner, an alternate image gives my screen capture (with Alt-Shift-G).If you want pronunciations, etymology, origins -- compare the pictures of Oxford and Merriam.I'm going to give the nod to Oxford, but MW still gets 5 stars from me.If you want lots of alternate words -- compare the pictures of Wordnet and Million.I'll give the nod to Wordnet, but Million Word still gets 5 stars from me.But judge the pictures yourself."
5,your best choice,My wife and I both enjoy crossword puzzles. We have used many different references in the past but none compare to this item. We both highly recommend this reference.
5,stellar,What can I say....sometimes you gotta cheat and this book will help you immeasurably...even if you use ink and white out
1,Not Good for Kindle,"For Kindle use, this is not a good book. You cannot search for a word. You are required to turn page after page until you find the right letter of the alphabet you are looking for. I wish I could get a refund!"
5,Review on Million Word Crossword Dictionary,"The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. It is an invaluable resource for crossword puzzle addicts...contains a wealth of names, places, and other resources."
2,Dictionary was missing pages 1143-1174,"I ordered this book knowing it was used. When it came, it looked just fine and I'm generally pleased. However, some pages were missing -- not torn out, just never inserted. I contacted the seller who refunded my money since they didn't have another copy. Fair enough. There's no way they could have known about the missing pages."
1,millon word crossword dictionary,"this book was delivered in good time and was in very good shape except there were 20 pages missing,I believe tyhey never were there. I recieved a full refund and am satisfied with the overall results"
5,Great Product!,My husband is a crossword puzzle fanatic and has several crossword dictionaries. I bought this one for him for Christmas and he has told me on many occasions that this is an awesome crossword dictionary.
5,The Million Word Crossword Dictionary,"If you do crossword puzzles,and you need help, this is the best reference book ever!"
5,The Million Word Crossword Dictionary,I use this everyday to complete crossword puzzles. It is a must have for everyone!
5,This is the one!!,"I got this as a Christmas present along with another crossword dictionary, and this is by far the best one. Even if you don't think an answer is in here, check anyway. Most of the time you'll be pleasently suprised. And if you can't find what you're looking for one way, try it a different way and there is a good possibility it's in there."
1,Million Dollar Crossword,I have yet to find the word to fit any clues. Book is huge and difficult to use. The last good crossword puzzle dictionary I found is twenty years old and falling apart but it is still more useful than this one is.
4,bfk,"The content is great - more than any other crossword dictionary I have seen, but the size is a little hard to work with."
4,iPad ap,Unfortunately with the new kindle update for my iPad I can no longer use this great reference book. I would think twice if you are going to use it on an iPad.
2,The Million Word Crossword Dictionary,"As far as Content, I believe this is one of the better Crossword dictionaries I've found in a while.My lower rating is based on the Kindle version. The indexing and search capabilities are extremely lacking. There is no way to go directly to a word in the dictionary, you have to go to the starting Letter for the word and page through the entire content for that letter or go by location. If you do search on a word, such as ""etude"", every word that contains those letter comes up, but not a way to click on that word and go to it in the dictionary."
5,Great Book,This book is outstanding. I bought the book for my Dad to replace a well worn copy of the A-Z Crossword dictionary. He just loves this one. It has just about any entry you could imagine.
5,Million Word Dictionary,This book is really great. I have been doing crossword puzzles for years and this is the most comprehensive and easy to use. I even order one for my daughter.
3,Probably the worst,"I have read everything in the Ultimate line so far, including the dreadful Hawk Owl and Woody. This collection is a low point for the Ultimate line. The story isn't great, the art is sub par, and it is basically just 2 issues collected with the Ultimate Handbook thrown in to fatten it up enough to make a trade paperback. I did like the informative handbook of all the characters that have appeared so far in the Ultimate universe. The 2 comic issues were just way below what you would expect. I collect the Ultimate line because they use top writers and artists. More dreck like this and I will start looking elsewhere for a good story."
2,What was the point?,"Collecting ""Ultimate X-Men/ Fantastic Four"" and ""Ultimate Fantastic Four/ X-Men"" plus the ""Official Handbook of the Ultimate Marvel Universe # 1-2"". If you want to get this for the handbooks then maybe I could recommend it. Lots of info there if you're into that sort of thing. Me? I got it for the story and the story had me asking, ""Why did they do this?"" It was a completely inconsequential story and didn't further anything along. The X folks, except for Kitty Pryde, Wolverine, and Iceman, are largely relegated to the sidelines and the Fantastic Four are all almost buffoonish. Everyone lacked any real team chemistry and the villain, some artificial intelligence chick called Rhona who becomes godlike after jacking Cerebro, has the most annoying way of conversing (trust me, you won't enjoy reading it). The art's meh. The book is readable, but not engaging. Close to a 1 starrer here. Avoid."
3,Light Duty,"It started off well, but my very active lab started ripping off chunks after 20 minutes. Usually Planet Dog does the trick, but the chew ratings, that are not always posted online, are very important."
2,Not for strong chewers,"This toy looks and feels durable; however, I do not recommend it if your dog is a strong chewer. Our Lab chewed the end off of the bone in about 5 minutes. It would be a great toy for dogs with weaker jaws."
1,Destroyed in 5 mins!,I am one of the ones with an intense chewer in the family. The only toy he cant destroy is the planet dog ball. Our dog is a pitbull/dalmation mix and he SHREDDED this toy in 5 minutes of playtime. Not safe for chewers at all! Beware!
3,Good Quality,"This is a great quality chew toy, though my Miniature Schnauzer showed no interest in it whatsoever."
5,Best bone for a chewer.,Bought one over a year ago and my little Eskie loves to chase and chew. He will go get his bone and bring it for a tug of war then let loose so I can throw it for him to fetch. The last one started to get a tear in the middle so ordered couple more as you never know when they stop making them. Great investment and loads of fun with your pet.
5,Holds up,My dog is a heavy chewer and not many things hold up to her but this does it. It's a lot more bendable then I thought it would but she hasn't taken a chunk out of it yet.
3,"Cute, but not that tough",My puppy is an avid chewer and this is just not going to last. It's already cracked. Lasted a good 5 days.
1,Gone in 60 Seconds,"My 1 year old female Black Lab had this bone in 40 pieces in about 60 seconds. If your dog is a chewer, don't buy it."
2,Not So Tuff,My 20 lb beagle mix LOVED this toy (so it gets 2 stars) but he destroyed it in about 30 minutes of playing with it. I'm expecting it to split here soon and will have to take it from him before he eats chunks. Definitely not worth $10.
2,Our beagle wouldn't touch it,"If you are familiar with beagles they rarely turn down anything. This bone? She smelled it and walked away. Never looked at it again, and I left it with her toys for months. Sad, really, because she loves to chew too. Go figure. Dogs."
2,"Definitely a ""tuff"" bone, if only the dog would like it!","We bought this bone because our dog is a voracious chewer - she destroys fluffy squeak toys in minutes and hard rubber chew toys in days. We thought this would be perfect...which it would be if she liked to chew it. She doesn't like it at all because (I'm guessing) there is no squeaker and there is no ""give"" to the toy (meaning she can't chew it into pieces bit by bit and destroy it). She does grab it every once in awhile, but never for more than a minute or two. So, while I had high hopes for her loving this as a chew toy, it just didn't happen."
3,Great canine appeal,"The planet dog bone sparked much interest in our Labrador. He has many other planet dog toys which are long lasting, however his one he destroyed in a matter of days. I think it has something to do with the shape."
1,NOT Tuff!!,"I bought one of these for my dogs at Christmas time. They loved it, it lasted 6 months of rough play before it started to split and break up. So I bought another one in July. It lasted 1 week. I thought I had found a good toy for my dogs, maybe it was just defective, I don't know. I would like to have another like the last, my dogs were dissapointed, they really enjoyed playing with it."
2,My dogs ignore this,"my two labs love to chew through toys, and I thought they'd love this, but they barely touch it. They'd much rather have a kong or a tennis ball or a rubber dog tire"
3,"Great, but not a good fit","I ordered one last year for my Nano 1G and it was the best holster I've purchased for an Ipod; however, I just ordered another one for a current 2G Nano and it no longer is compatible with where the touch dial is now located. I hope that the company will correct it to fit the newer models because I love this product for many reasons, especially being able to wear it on my waist and being able to flip it so that it can be read in the normal fashion, not upside down as most."
2,disappointed,"I was not thrilled when I opened this package. Maybe it was my fault, but I assumed I was purchasing yoga DVD's with instruction. Instead there is no video, it's just the guy's voice. So you basically need to memorize all of the poses he uses so you can follow along with the CD. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does come with nice flashcards picturing numnerous poses and modifications. Unless you are very experienced and know all pose's names, you don't want this CD collection."
2,Not for beginners,"While the concept of a yoga cleansing weekend is very interesting to me, I was overall unimpressed by the audio classes. They are not for beginners. They move very quickly and require a reasonable amount of prior knowledge with respect to the poses. Audio programs such as Shiva Rea's Yoga Sanctuary are much better. For those looking to get a sweat during their practice, this may suit. For those looking to more fully realize the benefits of the various poses, I would not recommend this product."
3,No Video on this DVD,"I have only done the first 20 minute Flow, but one thing that you should know, is that this is only an Audio DVD, No Video. I'm not sure how clear that is , but I certanly didn't realize that when I ordered it. You do get great flashcards that explain the positions, but not having video makes it a bit difficult to follow along at times."
4,Another great tool from Baron!,"What an amazing concept. After watching many a video of Baron's, I thought I would give the Bootcamp box a go. I love it! It really goes into detail everything you would ever need for one of his bootcamp classes, minus the great instructors.Please keep in mind my perspective is from a Yoga Instructor stand point. This may not be for you, if you have no experience with Yoga at all. Great for those that are familiar with the basics."
2,Disappointed on quality,"A family member has this pump and rocket balloons. Hers works great and our kids loved trying to catch the balloons. I ordered it and got a bad set. The pump is hard to use. Kids want to blow up the balloons themselves, but have to get help. We also had a lot of balloons that had to be thrown away because of holes or popped while blowing up. I'm hoping the replacement pack of balloons I bought from another vendor are better. If you can find a balloon pump at a store, get that so if it is hard to use you can at least exchange or return it. I found one at a Family Dollar or Dollar General discount store for around $4.00 in the party supplies. Overall it's fun if you are lucky to get a good pump and decent balloons."
2,Rocket balloons don't,"We have used this product before, and had great fun. However, out of the whole bag of balloons, not more than 3 could be used more than once! I will go back to getting them from Target."
5,Fun Balloons,When we have my son's pre-K friends over and they start fighting. I break out these balloons and they all start giggling because of the silly sound and flight paths.
3,"Super Fun, but too many pop immediately","All the kids in the neighborhood loved these. Fortunately I ordered two sets, so we had over 100 balloons. Unfortunately, over half of them broke just while being pumped up.Half of the ones that actually made it to full inflate popped shortly after. All in all they were a lot of fun, but after two hours... they were ALL popped! Keep in mind this was just from regular play, the kids weren't extra hard on them.They did love them and would like more. This time, I'll try some from the store."
5,Great summer time fun that keeps them running!!!!,We love these sets. I buy them when ever I can find them in the store and when I can't I go to the internet! I recommend them for use with adult supervision or teenage help. There is usually a balloon that will pop while you are blowing them up and some that will hit a sharp object and pop. We found that you can use them over about 4-8 or so many times before they get weak and will pop. Still a fun time that gets the kids running and tired!! Great to take to the beach so they fly into the water too!! Took them to Spain and they loved them there too!!
1,Dissappointing,Thank you for asking about my opinion. We used this product today for a science experiment demonstrating The laws of Newton. The bad part was that we demonstrated other laws by explaining the noise created when the balloons burst. Not many of the balloons lasted for a repeat launch in fact 75% of the balloons burst when initially inflated. This poor performance of the balloons greatly subtracted from the fun we usually have with these kind of balloons. I have used balloons like this before and the kids had a riot. Not this time. I hope that when I order replacement balloons that there will be a better effort to control quality.Good product but poor quality.Thanks again for asking.
4,Keeps kids busy,"Bought this for a family camp where there are a lot of little kids. Keeps them running around after the balloons, and you can pretty much stand in one place and launch them (for younger kids). Tires them out and entertains them--outstanding. My kids can use this themselves--they are 5 and 8--without any problems. Recommend buying the refills right away to avoid the stress of losing the balloons to popping (some frequency), trees, mud, etc. Can also be used to blow up regular balloons--although the necks are a bit wider on those."
2,initially fun but evenutally useless,"I cam across this toy at my nephews birthday party. It totally captivated 11 adults. So, I purchased on myself, telling myself that it was for when the nephews came to our house, but really knowing it was for me!The first few balloons were fine. Then I discovered that at least half of the balloons had holes in them in a spot that caused them to be useless. No, I am not going to buy more balloons as I am not going to throw good money after bad. Thankfully with an Amazon gift card, I only paid $0.98 for the toy, otherwise it would have gone straight back."
3,Shocking and Sickening,"I found this book shocking in the cruelness that is ""necessary"" to control a stallion. If a stallion is so mean to require the harshness in the book, then the stallion should be gelded or put down. Human life over animal everytime. The book goes into detail about how to control a mean stallion, but falls short at teaching how easy it is to prevent such bad behavior. Some of the restraints the author uses made me sick. I recommend The Horse Owner's Veterinary Handbook, by James Giffin M.D., and Tom Gore, D.V.M.,; there is a section on stallions that is very helpful (the whole book is great). I also recommend any of John Lyon's books (video's), particulary Lyon's on Horses. By establishing boundaries early and being consistent there will be no need for harsh physical restraints/abuse that is described in this book."
1,did not fit the vehicle as stated on product vehicle information,"This product did not fit and material is very cheap.Went through the ""Make sure this product fits your vehicle"", claims it fit, did no such thing!"
5,A returning customer,Love the product and the short time it takes to do my floors.I recomend it highly.
2,Appears to clean,"It does appear to clean the floor; but no matter what we have tried, there is no shine.Being our first pergo floor, I will admit the possibility of user error. But no matter the effort, buffing cloths and time spent, the floor still keeps a film."
2,Not the PERGO quality I am used to,"I bought this product after numerous others for my laminate flooring. I thought ""well, its from PERGO it has to work well on PERGO FLOORING"". Not the case. However, I found out from my landlord she only used a wet mop with water to mop this floor before me (yuck!!). It did make a noticable improvement to the floor. I think anything would have been an improvement from just water. I still had streaks and after it was dry you could see a film on the floor. The smell is not the greatest either. To me it smells like glue. Not a smell you want after busting your rear cleaning all day. I'd rather spend four dollars, get the same effect from a store bought brand, and have a nice smelling house. Not worth the time or the money."
3,Works okay!,I had a ton of soap stains in the bath room. I thought this thing would be a miracle worker but it works just okay! I would say its no better than lysol in the Kitchen and Bath for the heavy price tag I would probably not buy this product again!
3,Works better then most cleaners .,Had a lot of stains in the bath tub.Spayed clr on and let sit for about 15 mins.Then scrubbed with a brush. The stains came out pretty good.One more treatment should do it. I was surprised at the price amazon was advertising clr for.I found this bottle at lowes for $4.48.
2,Intermittent Operation - NOT Worth it!,"Used for a few months and then threw in the trash. When it does work the flame is enormous and you must hold 4 - 5 inches away from cigar tip. Cannot use the flame length setting because it only works on the strongest setting.However, this lighter is intermittent at best. Even with a full charge from zippo butane. It sputters and spurts and then goes off."
4,Eazy 2 use lighter,"My wife loves this eazy to use lighter that she received as a Christmas present from her loving husband, he is the luckiest guy alive.Rickf178"
4,Research paper idea-authors,Great book for research paper on this author. Easy to skim over/read quickly. Good info on author.
5,Soon to be a (Guitar Master),I am a guitar player of many years. I have never had the pleasure of hearing such an accomplished 14yr old guitarist have such command of a guitar as Nick. Prodigy? YES! Nick is great. I recommend all music lovers to buy all this young musicians work. Rock on Nick.DT
4,Watch out for this guy!,"This guy is going to be big! He has already mastered what takes most people decades to do. More than just a prodigy, he actually has his own style and inflections on his music. I cant wait to see what he does next."
5,Truly AMAZING!!!,"Your ears will not believe that this is coming from someone so young. Don't let his age fool you, he can keep up with the best! Nick not only has total command of the guitar, but he writes incredibly catchy hooks. This CD will have your head rockin' from the start. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,SHOW JUST HOW BAD HOGAN IS,I GOT THIS TAPE IN JUNE O5 I GOT IT FOR THE MAIN EVENT TO BAD THE MAIN EVENT SUCKED BUT THERE ARE SOME GOOD MATCHS ON HERE BUT DONT SPEND 40 BUCKS ON THIS.BUY IF YOU CAN GET IT FOR LIKE 20 AND DONT GET IT FOR HOGAN VS STING
4,Gray hair was covered longer!,"This is the first time I use this product. I noticed my dye lasted more. I have lots of gray hair, this time, using this product, my gray hair stayed covered longer."
3,Not What I Expected,"Honestly? For all of the hype I read about this product, I had to try it. However, I really did not notice my coolr lasting longer than usual. Sorry. I guess I have truly persistent gray and saw no personal benefit to using this product."
1,awful,"this book is providing unneccesary info about islam that is false and very unacceptable.. especially page 17 when he writes""The modern Westerner has no difficulty in showing how Muhammad may have been mistaken."" it isbiasedand totally not reflecting history but showing a great deal of propaganda.."
1,Taqiyya Fest: holy deception,"Not a historically accurate account.See the following books:""Understanding Muhammad: A Psychobiography"" by Ali Sina""Why I Am Not a Muslim"" by Ibn warraq""Islamic jihad: A Legacy of Forced Conversions, Imperialism, and Slavery"" by M.A.Khan"
5,Patrice Pike does it again!,Patrice Pike has created another winning CD with her signature rock style and soulful lyrics. See her live if you get the chance- she puts on a great show!
2,nothing special,"I saw her on Rock Star Supernova. When she does other people""s songs she very good. When she did this cd, not so good. IF you're a die hard fan you may like this cd."
4,Nice find,I was pleasntly suprised listening to this. I hope she keeps the music coming. Even got me to rediscover Rufus.
5,The bakers encyclopedia,"If you are into research, baking or pastry, this is a valuable encyclopedia, the author E. Pyler that pass way a few years ago after he completed the third or second edition if I am not mistaken, for my self that like to research I could not find something so complete as this literature.It became my reference book for many of my formulation whether are in the pastry or baking industry, Pyler gives you so much information that you have to make notes to keep track of what you are reading. Never the less I have a great interest in chemistry other wise I wouldn't like pastry and baking.After reading the book it made me understand, the principals of baking, understanding each and every item that he researched for us open a vast wide door to our industry.Highly recommended, a great study book and a must in every baker and pastry chef library."
3,"Good story. Worth seeing, but the book is much better.","Cold Sassy Tree is a great story. It gave me a new perspective of Southern life at the turn of the century. It was especially fun to see a young Neil Patrick Harris (aka Doogey Howser) in the role of Will (the story is told from Will's perspective). I only gave it 3 stars, though because the video doesn't do the book justice. The video leaves out a lot of sub-plots from the book. If you truly want a great experience, READ THE BOOK!"
3,"Not bad, fairly entertaining","Dunaway produced this one herself after a string of lousy flops that had no artistic value at all, and I mean a loooong string of them. Cold Sassy Tree isn't too bad. It was made for cable. It has a fairly tight script and a good cast. She and Wildmark fall in love in a small town in the South. He is an old widower, she is either a widow or a spinster, I cannot remember which. His family disapproves. They forge ahead with their love and at the end, everyone is happy. This is post-face work for Dunaway, I think Beverly Hills Madam was the last we saw of the original Dunaway face, sadly. Nevertheless, this is a good movie. It is not something to watch over and over, but it's good for a single sitting."
1,VHS Tape,"The movie is very good, interesting and entertaining. The original needs to be placed on a DVD. The tape was poor quality"
3,Infamous Film A Proud Time Traveler,"Considered to be Presley's weakest movie to date, KC looks fairly hip today. Maybe after ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" and MTV and on and on, this little piece o' fluff does holds your interest after the first 29 songs! Actually, the music is quite good, especially the hit title tune, featuring a swaggerin' El, and ""Tender Feeling"", a beautiful ballad sung by his movie ""twin"" to Cynthia Pepper (who skillfully plays the Military Secrerary hastily summoned to lend credence to Lt. Presley's creative attempts to convince distant relatives that their Smokey mountain home would be vastly improved by the addition of a missile site). Yeah, there are too many songs and production values are low. But E.P. afficionados - it's another don't-believe-the-critics!"
2,Wrong aspect ratio listed on amazon.,It is a very narrow 2.35:1 There will be black on the top and bottom of even a wide screen tv.
5,A GOOD SONG TO LEARN!,"This movie is an Elvis Presley hillbilly versus military nonsense musical comedy, so it's just great fun to relax and watch.I especially liked one of the songs that he sings, ""TENDER FEELING"", so I learned to sing it, recorded it, and posted my homemade amateur video recording at the YOU TUBE web site, and on my own personal web site, ""OUR ETERNAL STRUGGLE"".There's also a particularly amusing episode with the family hound accompanying the matriarch as she wails her lament."
5,Exactly as described,"Hi,We ordered ""Kissin' Cousins"" DVD because my husband had never seen it.....Arrived on time in good condition. it was eaxactly as eaxpected."
2,KC Looks Hipper Every Year,"Alrhough this EP outing was considered his weakest to date, today it succeeds as colorful entertainment. With especially fine performances by Jack Albertson, Yvonne Craig, and Cynthia Pepper (playing a hastily summoned stenographer in charge of keeping track of Lt. Morgan's [Elvis'] creative attempts at convincing distant relatives that their ""Big Smokey"" mountain home could be better utilised as a missile base), the under-developed script can be somewhat overlooked. Although one or two songs could have been cut and included only on the LP, the title tune on 45rpm remains a lost classic, with Elvis in full swagger. Elvis' first official ""low budget quickie"" is not for the more discriminating fan, but will bring a smile to most others. (Rating is 2-PLUS; surprisingly low Embarrassment Factor of 3)."
2,Just plain bad.,"Elvis with blond hair? Less than memorable songs. Not to mention an Elvis who is less than in his prime. Incest is never a good thing. The only things that should be kept in the family are mafia business and heirlooms.That said, in a way, it's a creative Elvis movie. He plays a dual role.All in all, however, I recommend avoiding this if possible. If you want to see Elvis, try something better, like Clambake.That's all."
2,Fun storyline hurt by low production values,"Considered his weakest flick at the time, KC lands in 2K with a fairly low EMBARRASSMENT FACTOR of 3 (of 10), attributed to a typically congenial Presley, some bouyant tunes, and a generally happy atmosphere (despite the reported 18-day shooting schedule). Careful post-production musical deletions and reduction of running time would have helped. (Rating is a high-2)."
1,Two Elvises for the Price of None!,"Elvis Presley's first truly bad movie. Produced by low-rent Sam Katzman, ""Kissin' Cousins"" (1964) saddles the King with a sitcom-level script, forgettable songs and cheap sets. Presley and the supporting players try their best, but it's a hopeless situation. Not surprisingly, Elvis hated his contrived dual role and the blond wig."
4,A Fun Movie,"This one may not have been one of the king's best, but it wasn't his worst either. It was, indeed, a fun and entertaing film that has a cute story, sexy 'cousins' and 'kitty hawks', good comedy style performances by Arthur O'Connell and Jack Albertson, and of course, great songs by Elvis. I enjoy watching it and have yet to get tired of it. Only thing is that maybe Josh and his 2 female cousins could have been more closely related than 4th once removed to, maybe, challenge the audience, but maybe not. Perhaps the Elvis audience of the mid 60s wasn't ready for that kind of a challenge then. Definatly a very entertaining movie for even non-Elvis fans. 4 stars all the way!"
5,FIRE STARTERS,"We have used this product before and they definitely will start a fire. We have two wood stoves, I saw this great buy on the product which is why I bought 7 boxes. If you need a product to get that wood stove or even use in your grill they work fantastic."
2,Just Okay,"I thought my 4 year old would love this book, but after I chose to read it to her a couple of times, she has never chosen it to read on her own or for me to read."
5,An excellent recording,"A great performance, one of the great players of our time recording some beautiful music, like, Skylard, and Milestones, etc,. Each time you listen, you may hear something you sort of missed the time before.It s five star."
3,"No surprises, but a decent intro to Monheit.","If you are unfamiliar w/ Jane Monheit, this isn't a bad disk to get. The songs are fairly characteristic of her music. It's chill and still fun, but not especially deep. Really, I don't think these are her very best. Her live performances are much more enjoyable, but this collection is good for giving a solid cross-section of her music. For example, ""Waters of March"" has a good vibe and ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up the Most"" takes a very mellow approach, showing a bit of her range. I can only recommend it to people on that basis. If you want some mellow, easy vocal jazz and don't own any of Monheit's stuff, this is a pretty good CD. Personally, I think Diana Krall would be better to add to a growing collection."
2,"It's not her best, but it's still great.","This is the purest and truest soprano voice since Joan Baez. I don't think it's the 'very best' of Jane's work, the new CD 'Surrender' is my favorite, but there's no doubt she's going to be at the top of her profession very soon. I just hope she stays with Jazz."
4,A Story Of Greed,"Kit Franklin receives an invitation to meet a mysterious admirer at Grandma O's Restaurant. She is curious because the unknown suitor has been sending roses to her for three straight days. When Kit arrives at the restaurant, she is greeted by a sixtyish stranger who speaks her name and then promptly collapses. The man later dies in a hospital of unknown causes. Then Kit disappears and the authorities suspect she is a kidnap victim. On one level this book is about greed and the harm caused by families trying too hard to bury secrets from the past. There are just enough strands to the story to make it interesting but not too confusing."
2,Should have been a solo disc,"This reminded me more of Johnette's cool ""Sketchbook"" solo CD than a Concrete Blonde disc. I have to say it's pretty self indulgent (""Jim Needs an Animal""). There's some nice stuff on here, and Johnette sounds velvety (but subdued), but compared to past discs (esp. Mexican Moon and Bloodletting) this one's pretty lame. For die-hard CB fans only."
3,Disappointing CD from a Fantastic Group,"I am a great fan of Johnette (solo, with Concrete Blonde and as Pretty and Twisted, but this CD just doesn't do it for me. I got the feeling the group spent their vacation in the Mohave Desert and just decided to do a CD around that theme, nature, etc. Johnette's usual honest, soul-searching lyrics aren't here, and she speaks rather than sings too often. There's little punch to any of the songs. What happened, folks? I almost get the feeling you owed the recording company one more CD, so you threw this one together without putting your hearts into it. Luckily we have so many other wonderful CDs by the group to turn to."
3,Still better than most of what I hear today.,"Ok, I admit this isn't their best album, but I still enjoy most of it, and it's still Concrete Blonde. ""A Road"" is a good rocking opener, and the next two tracks are strong as well. The cool cover of ""Ghost Riders In The Sky"" is appropriate for them, and especially this album. Mid-album is kind of slow, and there is a spoken-word track in ""Mojave"", but ""Snakes"" is better, and a bit spooky. ""Jim Needs An Animal"" is a decent shot of humor, and does stick out as the only silly spot on the album. This ends with ""Tornado At Rest"", which isn't the greatest song, but it is a good ender. Overall this isn't the first Concrete Blonde album I would reach for, but recently it's gotten alot more play than ""Bloodletting""."
2,sigh,"I love concrete blonde and have stayed true for about 20 years but this album is the first to truly disappoint. first of all, johnette and jim should have stayed the hell away from the recording console and let someone else record it; everything sounds mushy and the drums tiny . where are the killer hooks, guys? most the songs sound like unfinished jams with no distingushable guitar riffs; I miss Jim's guitar playing up front so much i'm pulling my hair out piece by piece. Jim is the best lead guitarist ever to come out of L.A. EVER and here he is playing mostly bass and rhythmn! aaaargggggh! yes, live they are still the most soulful band around, easliy conceded point, and the album isnt all bad..."
1,Shocked and Dismayed,"To be totally honest, I thought this CD was horrible and it has ended up in the floorboard of my car. Disjointed, too ephermal, too PURPOSELY atmospheric, too grit and sand and reptillian for me. It seemed soulless and barren, much like a desert. Add that to the fact that it is NOTHING like anything done before, and you have one dissapointed long-time fan. Johnette's voice, while probably even better than it used to be, is not used to maximum effect. She whispers through half the songs and talks through the other half. 1/4 of the songs sound like funeral marches, another 1/4 is either spoken or whispered, and another 1/4 is just silly, sub-sophomoric, and innane. Only 3 or 4 songs have the Concrete Blonde quality and sound that I'm used to. Tornado, A-Road, and Because are the only decent tracks on the album, and I leave myself wondering, has Johnette finally had one too many cocktails?"
4,A last ghostly gasp from Concrete Blonde,"A definitive work that gives up all of their ""pop"" sounds from the past, Johnette and Mike make some very interesting tracks, apart from the silly ""Mike needs an animal"". Striking are the mystical tunes ""The A Road"", ""Hey Coyote"" and ""Mojave"". A psychedelic tour on ""Himalayan Motorcycles"" is a nice trip. Johnette's interpretation of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" is hypnotic.Overall, this is not an album for someone looking for another ""Joey"" is looking for. This is the transition to Johnette's ""Scarred"" and other works."
2,Not Accurate,"When I first tried to get it going I had a lot of difficulty getting the remote and the main station to sync up.After I got it going the remote temp was off by about 8-15 degrees consistantly showing it to be warmer outside than it really was. I tried it in numerous locations to make sure I was getting accurate readings unlike the IPCC weather stations positioned near A/C units and such.So it appears the La Crosse is some sort of global warming support instrument that consistantly shows hotter out than it really is.Also, I emailed the company about problems and didn't hear back in the similar fashion that Al Gore eludes all debate challenges."
3,Unique Among The Series,"This volume had a poor cover art and horrible internal artwork. However - the story was like no other - very good plot for the most part. It reminds me of a Star Trek episode that Trekies may recall in the original 1960's series involving ""L'Andrew"". The villagers in that show and in this book are all acting ""wierd"" and there exists a strange presence in the air. I never liked the swift paced higher volumes as well as the lower volumes - and this book written 30 years earlier may have become much better. The brothers travel to England - become involved in the pusuit of witches and is the only volume of it's kind. The criminals remain undisclosed until the very end - something I rather liked. A definate worth read. RATED C+"
4,"Classic, well-written Hardy Boys book","A classic!! Well-written masterpiece with witches, curses, museum robbery, etc. One of the best Hardy Boys books that will keep you flipping one page after another until you finish it!"
3,Buffy the Slayer vampire,"Celina the new vampire in Sunnydale has only one thing in mind,killing Buffy. Celina first trys to get Buffy's address from Anya. And she is not very nice about it. In fact Anya is so shaken up by the encounter, that when D'Hoffryn shows up with a once in a lifetime offer Anya jumps for joy.At first Buffy doesn't think Celina is so tough even with warings from Angel. Untlil she discover she's a Slayer vampire from 1527. Will Buffy drive a stake though this cold Slayer's heart or will she become the next Slayer vampire? I thought the book didn't really hit the mark of the chacters. They were just a tad off. It had a good concept but the way it turned out was kind of disappointing. However the fight scences were great. And reading a novel set in season five was refreshing. The book wasn't Immortal, or The Book of Fours. But it was a hell of a lot better then Return to Chaos, or Resurrecting Ravana."
3,found it lacking...,"I read the description of this book and could not wait to get my hands on it, Buffy & Angel, a turned Slayer, I mean that is exciting stuff. Well except for the fact that the relationhip between Buffy and Angel really takes a BIG backseat in this to finding out about the Vampire Slayer Vampire. There was SO much more that could have been done, it just doesn't reach its full potential.If you are picking this book because of the Buffy & Angel connection there are a few sweet moments, but I mostly felt cheated. If you are a Major Anya fan on the other hand this book is so for you!"
4,Cassia Marsilka 1527A.D.,"I found this book very imaginitive. Not only that but descriptive, intelligent, and captivating. The last chapter really demonstrated the characters ultimate desires, desicions, and choices. This literature is appealing to the young and the old even if your not a fan of the show. Overall it was a well written peice, it only got four stars because the plot was jumpy and the characters were somewhat out of place.I'm a vascuous tramp with low self-esteem, but I know a good book.A"
2,Drywall Vacuum Hand Sander.,Cumbersome to use and it didn't do a very good job keeping the dust down. I would not purchase again. This will go into the next garage sale.
3,"Does not fit 2.5"" standard vac hoses","Even though it does not fit, making it completely useless to me, I still gave it 3 stars because I would guess it might work fine with a smaller vac hose.It comes with a small 1.25"" hose, but comes with an adapter to be used with a 2.5"" hose as advertised.However, the adapter does not fit a 2.5"" hose. It's close, but it's just small enough that it can't form a seal. It'd get sucked into the hose it's so small.Just to be clear, I have a standard 2.5"" hose, and I've bought after other market attachments which have all fit just fine. This does not fit."
2,Not as I expected,I was disappointed with the hand sander. I was using the product to sand down paint so I could mud new drywall to existing. The suction works great but the sand paper didn't do much and the screen actually tore. I ended up buying an electric sander and it worked like a dream.
3,Not as comfortable as a competitor,"I have used a different model (similar to the Fibatape model) for years. The curved handle on the competitor is more comfortable and the angled take off for the vacuum hose makes using the sander much easier, both in terms of getting in closer to the bottom of the sander and also keeping the hose from getting in the way when sanding. On the plus side, I like the Hyde tools sanding screen attachment system better. But since the hose tends to get in the way when sanding, I prefer the design of the Fibatape model."
2,Didn't work as expected,"I was doing some repairs to my walls, preping for painting. Had a bunch of nail pops that I repaired and was hoping to speed up the sanding time, but also minimize the mess with that dust free hand sander. It does a good job at eliminating dust, but it was way to hard to work with. It's just too cumbersome, and just didn't do anywhere near the job that a normal hand sander can do. Maybe it was the size of the pad being so large, or how rigid it was. I won't be using it again. Fortunately it was not that expensive."
4,Worked for me - even with Electrolux home vacuum cleaner,"Seemed to work pretty much as advertised. I think that the claims being made by some reviewers as to the efficacy are rather optimistic, but on balance it still seemed to work reasonably well, and I certainly don't regret getting it.It's probably worth noting that the adapter kit that comes with it IS sufficient to connect the sander to a normal home type Electrolux cylinder vacuum cleaner, as well as normal shop vacs. However, you have to plug the sander's hose directly into the cylinder. You can't connect to the hose (short of using gaffer tape or some such), so the end result is less convenient than you'd like."
5,I Used It Yesterday - It Works,"I am sensitive to dust. I could detect no dust. No irritation.One sheet of drywall screen came with the kit, it had a little life after an average size bedroom.It's a keeper."
2,Nothing Amazing,"Like other reviewers have said, this book was lacking something. I believe that the book lacked subtlety and therefore was not as suspenseful or page-turning as it could have been. Sure, the plot was interesting enough, but nothing was left to the imagination and there was so much predictability and over-foreshadowing.I didn't stop reading it halfway through, but I don't think I'll read any more Philbrick novels."
2,Not good.,The characters are well drawn and sympathetic but that's the only good thing I can say about this. The supernatural horror that haunts the family is all powerful so its a bit like watching Final Destination but without the laughs....you just watch helplessly as people die in various gruesome ways. I think the author was trying for a Fall of the House of Usher sense of doom but it never really comes across. There is no explaination given why the horror is so powerful. There's a lot of heavy handed preaching about the evils of slavery. Lastly the main character is pretty spineless and doesn't make one effective move or plan.
4,Solid,"Historical fiction with mystery, horror and a touch of the supernatural all rolled-up into one solid story; no doubt a page-turner."
2,Slow mover with very little going for it.....,"This is the third Max Brand paperback I've read lately. If ""Rescue of Broken Arrow"" had been my first, it might have been my only. The storyline moved extremely slow. The author's use of flowery prose seemed a little out-of-place for a true western (i.e., ""Then the green of the woods closed over them, joining above their heads in green Gothic vaults, crossed with lierne and ogive faintly open to the sprinkling of bright stars above them."") The only plus I saw regarding this particular western was that the author did an excellent job of noting the transformation of the main character, Cashel, from a young eastern renegade thief maturing into a man who finds his niche in life."
5,humo de tabaco,"me facino este cd lleno de musica afro jazz cubana, alex is a great musico , he brings a magical sound to our ears !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Fantastic,"I met this guy in a busy cafe in San Francisco. He offered to share a table since we were both alone. After talking to him and hearing how he described his music and his inspirations, I was intrigued. I listened to all the tracks and am going to order this cd. I think my husband, who is also Cuban, is really going to enjoy it. Not only does he make great music, but he was a really nice guy and very excited about his craft."
1,This is not authentic,A pretentious CD that tries to be a contemporary Cuban recording and fails miserably. It has occasional Cuban flavours but then you realise how dated and forced these instances are. There are much better REAL Cuban records out there.
1,Big disappointment,This pitcher did not withstand the test of time. We had it for approximately two months when the area where the handle connects to the pitcher began to crack. We never handle it rough nor even put it in the dishwasher.
1,Will crack at base of handle,"I bought this pitcher at BB&B; on sale. It was beautiful, and served it's purpose for 3 uses. But on it's final day, I poured the last glass of water and sat it on the counter. About 15 minutes later, we heard a cracking sound. I walked over to the pitcher and found that it had a long crack starting just below where the handle is mounted, curving upward about 5 inches.This pitcher was treated gently, and had very little temperature variations.....e.g. we like tap-temperature water with no ice. It was never put in the refrigerator. It was hand-washed.This product is not up to normal Luigi standards."
1,Weak product,We also had the picture for only about 2 months when it got a huge crack along the side with the handle. We never dishwashed it and used it only once. Other than that it was stored carefully.
2,Beautiful BUT Poorly Made,"It's beautiful. It really is. And, unlike one of the other reviewers, I found it poured better than any other glass pitcher I've ever owned.BUT, like seemingly everyone else, it cracked the first time we used it - no temperature extremes, no dishwasher, just an interior crack running down from where the handle joins the pitcher at the top.I'm very disappointed as I love the looks and that I don't drench myself or the table trying to pour but I can't use a cracked pitcher!"
2,A hacked version of the classic anthology,"As a huge fan of the author and the original release of this brilliant short story collection, I am extremely disappointed in the new release. HUNT DOWN THE ORIGINAL. The new version omits all of Zelazny's forewords and, more damning, it actually omits some of the better stories found in the original collection. Silverburg mentions ""Horsemen!"" in the introduction, then the story is strangely absent. This is a travesty."
3,Isobel's Wedding,"First of all I liked this book because it was thick, very thick! Most books I've read lately have been so thin I've read them in two days! So I enjoyed having a nice big book to read. The story goes through Isobel's life, she is 2 weeks away from getting married when her finance decides to hold off the wedding. She is devistated and never quite get's over it. She moves to Spain and tries to start a whole new life. I won't say anymore because I don't want to ruin it! But the book is interesting all the way though, though sometimes Isobel can get a little too pathetic. For such a long book it doesn't feel like it is since the story keeps flowing. While the ending is kind of disappointing for a book that has taken you through such a long journey of her life, it's not reason enough not to read it. Hopefully there will be a sequel or something. So if you feel like a nice light read, and want to sympathize with another woman then I definatly recommend it!"
4,A Real Page Turner,"As always, Sheila O'Flanagan does not disappoint...much.The book was engrossing and entertaining. The descriptions of life in Spain were wonderful and I felt like I was right there with Isobel.But...I found Isobel to be somewhat annoyingly oblivious to Tim and her relationship with him. However, this is realistic because we've all probably had friends dating men that everyone in the world can see through except for the girl. Or even ourselves! Overall, though, Isobel was likeable and I found myself staying up late last night to see what happened to her.The ending didn't quite tie up all the loose ends and I would have liked to see a short epilogue....or perhaps Sheila can write us another book about Isobel...hint hint.Edit: It turns out that apparently in one of the short stories in ""Connections"" Isobel's story continues and we get to find out what happened after. I haven't read this, just thought I'd let everyone know!"
1,"Why, why, why did they add F.O.S. to this product???????","I have been using this product for 5 years for my Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome. This product has reduced pains, bloating and flatulance for me. I wouldn't hesitate a second to rate the old version of this product with 5 stars. It was a real good help to me. However, now after they added the FOS I can not tolerate the product any more. Now the product GIVES me pain and gas in stead. So either if I quit or if I continue I am lost. If there are more of you who agree with me, please email them or call them (Nature's way). I have allready done that 2 times. I don't know what to do. This is like taking away the heart medicine from a heart sick patient. :("
4,Probiotic Oral Capsules- Very Honest & Open Review(just a warning),"I purchased this after reading that it may help women with bacterial vaginosis. After having my son 6 months ago I get recurrent BV infections and antibiotics take care of the problem but the BV just comes right back. It is the most annoying thing and it really puts a cramp in my marriage as I am very self conscious of this problem. It's a had thing to come to terms with when you've never had issues in that department before. I have been taking these for a few weeks now and I can't say that I notice a difference with the BV, but I do notice a difference in my digestion, which is what this is truly meant for. I am very regular which is nice. I am going to continue taking these at least until I am done with the bottle, I will update the review if I notice any changes."
1,Major issues!,I ordered this product thinking that maybe switching from Align to a different product might be good for my system. Big mistake. Tried this product for 2 days and had HORRIBLE - and I do mean HORRIBLE - problems with flatulence. Have periodic issues with flatulence but this was non-stop - could not even leave the house. Stopped the product and the issue immediately ceased. For me - this was something I threw away!
4,Good product,I took these for about 3 months. I didn't really notice any improvements but I didn't have any negative effects either.
1,Totally useless,"Don't bother with this book. The errata on this is amazing, there are more pages with mistakes than not. That includes the answers to the review questions. There is hardly any good information in it, and it certainly won't prepare you for a test."
1,This book is in dire need of an editor,This book is poorly written with numerous mistakes. I'm disappointed I purchased it and I plan on using another company (Sybex Network Press) for the remainder of my studies. The subject matter is difficult enough without having to determine if the author's information is correct.
1,This book is horrible,"I used Exam Cram books to help me pass five MCSE exams. For the last test, I thought I might try out the Exam Prep series. Big mistake! The list of errors from Coriolis' website is 17 pages long, not to mention two rather large files that have been left off of the CD. The text is poorly written, though the book is rather long, there seems to be very little useful information in it. There are more practice questions at the end of every chapter, but there are no explanations included with the solutions. Read the other reviews and heed their warnings. This book stinks."
1,Error after error,This is a dangerous book for anyone who doesn't already know the topic real well. Full of factual errors (not just simple typos).
4,Maniac Cop is back! But this time he has a playmate...,"Matt Cordell rises from his watery grave and seeks revenge on those who killed him in the previous entry. He also causes trouble by killing cops and helping the criminals. And when he teams up with a homicidal serial killer, it's up to though cop Sean Mc Kinney and his partner Susan Riley to stop this murderous duo before it's to late.A very entertaining and well acted movie. Better than you'd expect and well directed by William Lustig (Maniac, Uncle Sam)One of the film most memorable scenes is where Matt Cordell causes a massacre at a police station.The Maniac Cop movies are very underated slashers in my opninion. So, if you like other slasher movie series such as Friday The 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play and Halloween, you should add Maniac Cop 1-3 to your collection as well."
4,The best in the trilogy!,"Maniac Cop 2 is the best in the whole trilogy! It has some really awesome action scenes and some funny one-liners from the murderer that Matt Cordell becomes friends with. The car chase mid-way through the movie was awesome and well thought out. Robert Z'dar gives an awesome and well played performance in his second go 'round as the Maniac Cop. If you're into action movies with a little bit of horror, then be sure to give this one a look!"
1,Whistler Crusader,"It looked like a good idea. But, it comes with no speaker system and only a blinking LED connection. The LED isn't visible in bright sunlight. If you purchase the remote helmet accessory, the problem is the same. Works great at night, but not in the day unless you stick it in your eye. YOu also have 4 wires coming up your handle bars, more going to the rear, more to the front, and a ridiculous temperature sensor hanging there. Range is poor -- I can see most CHP units before or at the same time the gadget 'glows'. Messy, so universal in mounting gadgets that none of them are ""great"" for much more than Rube Goldberg setups. I have yet to see where you get the 'audio"" accessory mentioned in the manual. Unfortunately, by the time you bend and shape things to mnout the three or four gadgets, adjust the wiring, and place the sensors -- it is no longer returnable."
1,Hope you get one that works,"Installed the unit and within days it started to give continuous alerts. Contacted Whistler Customer service and after confirming that it was installed correctly, was told to take the unit out and send it back because ""the engineers were interested in looking at it"". When I asked for a replacement unit (since this takes some time to install) there was no offer to replace, no offer to pay for shipping, no estimate of time it would take. I wouldn't recommend the unit, or the company."
1,Whistler Cruisader Motorcycle Radar Detector,"I received a great price on this from the vendor ($99) with free shipping.The design is extremely well thought out for use with a motorcycle, and it installed nicely with little difficulty.After installation, it tested out fine on the first two bike rides, but on the third use of the system, the display back light came on, but no text displays would appear.Using the installation manual and on line manufacturer's trouble shooting guide, I did repeated ""restore to factory settings"" to no avail.The Amazon vendor who sold it to me was great, providing free return shipping and a prompt full refund."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Would give zero stars if possible. I was pretty excited about this and it sounded like a great idea. I have wired multiple rollercoasters and consider myself knowledgeable in wiring installation. After 4 or so hours or installation. I turned it on and got the infamous COM ERROR..... So I tried all the things the manual recommends and checked all the connections and still the same problem so... I called customer support and they said to pull it all off and send it in to inspect. They said it takes 3 weeks. This is a horrible product and everyone is having the same problem DO NOT BUY spend a little extra money and buy something else that will work and really is an ""Easy Installation"""
1,Kuenzli is a liar,"This collection of essays is highly damaged by editor Rudolf Kuenzli's ""Surrealism and Misogyny"" which stands as one of the worst essays ever written on surrealism due to its outragous claims that mysteriously lack any citations! Kuenzli should be writing for the National Enquirer. For people who are honestly interested in the proposed topic (Surrealism and Women) I would much rather direct your attention towards Penelope Rosemont's anthology, where the women speek for themselves."
1,More Examples Needed,"I am using this book for my Digital Design course (Computer Science). The book lacks clear examples that explain concepts thoroughly. If you are taking Digital Design or a course that uses this book, please request that your professor select another book. Also, as another commenter wrote, be prepared to buy another text. You could start you search with MIT's OpenCourseWare."
1,Prepare to buy supplemental texts,"This book makes me angry. A good introductory book explains concepts carefully, step-by-step, and will explain them a second or third time while rewording them. This book presents an idea once and does so in such a poor matter that the reader is left with the burden of hunting down explanations to fill the gaps. If you, like me, are forced to use this book in a class, get ready to spend more money on additional books.One reviewer who gave this 5 stars called it digital poetry. I recognize why he did so, and to one who already understands these concepts, it probably qualifies. But then, if they already understand, why would they need this book? And if they don't understand, writing in such a compact form won't help them to do so -- A beginning student of English doesn't read poetry; they read primers. One might wish to prime their firewood with this text."
3,evilmaniac,This was a required reading for one of my university courses. The book does offer excellent explanations but does lack in examples (especially graphical ones). There are no solutions to either odd or even problems at the back of the book which was rather disappointing.
1,More Examples,"The title explains it. The book is very detailed, however it lacks any real examples. If your class requires this book make sure you get your instructor to fill in any blank spaces you may have.One other thing I noticed is the book has a different standard, which may not be the fault of the book and more so of the actual field itself, of ""prefixes for powers of 10."" Example K (kilo) is 2 to the 10th and not 10 to the 3rd).I'm just happy this is the only class of this type I will be taking."
1,The worst I have ever seen,"This book is the WORST book I ever used. There are barely any examples. The contents are written very unclearly. It takes long time to undertand the SOLVED EXAMPLE in the book, let alone the problems.Even solved problems on the website, you find wrong solutions...I DO NOT recommand anyone even read this book..."
1,was the lowest I could go,This book is the worst book I ever used there are barely any examples or I should say full examples. The index doesn't match the text so you can't use it to look up key points. If you have a instructor who is going to use this book do yourself a favor and tall him/her out of it.
1,Not worth the price!,"Mano and Kime do an admirable job of organizing the enormous content that this book covers, however they skim across topics that should be covered in depth and devote page after page on information that students will never use again. It is time they removed their heads from the sand and actually write a book that is worth the price tag."
1,Better off without the book,Would you believe they used this book for a computer science class? The class is hell because of it and the teacher. It has no answers for problems so you don't know if you're right or wrong. It's examples that it does give are horrible and it never fully explains anything. It doesn't even deserve 1 star (how bout -2stars!).
2,Wish there was a answer key !!,"This book covers a lot of topics dealing with computer designs. However, when you reach the part of solving the exercise problems, it only gave me more problems because I was never sure with the answer I came up with."
1,Not a service but cause of confusion,Here is a useless book in this field that can cause much confusion in the minds of students. The book seems to be jumping around all over the place and all those hard to understand concepts can very well be explained in simpler terms with examples as we have done in our outside the book discussions. Better grab some other books and don't waste your money on this book.
5,Excellen book and companion software,"The previous reviewer complained that solutions to the exercises were not available. Since this is obviously a text book to be used in a course, I don't fault the author for not providing answers to the problems. Moreover, he does provide the answers to select problems on his www page.The Xilinx student software is a great way to learn digital logic. Xilinx dominates most of the FPGA applications and experience with their software and more familiarity with their chips makes the Xilinx software a great choice.Be aware that there is a ""2nd Edition Updated"" that is to be released soon. I spent $100 and already found out that it is out of date. I hope the author includes any supplementary material for the updated 2nd edition on his www page as well."
5,nice,"good, looks new and no writing on the book.besides the time i wait, everything is goodhope to buy again if possible"
3,decent book,"The book is well organized and written. However, there are no answers to the exercises given in the book. Overall, a decent introductory book for CS/CE/EE majors."
3,El Alquimista,Tal vez escuche tanto hablar de esta novela que esperaba algo distinto. Sera porque ya alcance mis suenos? Bueno... Todavia me quedan algunos mas.Gracias!Damaris
4,entretenido...,"un cuento entretenido, fácil de leer y con algunos consejos útiles...por algo es un clásico ""light"" moderno, ideal para lectores que no quieren complicarse la existencia y pasar un buen rato."
4,It' s a fable full of symbolic meaning.,It's like a fairy tale and I do not particularly like the genre but it is well written and it makes you reflect on its several second meanings. The writer shows his mastery in dealing with the language and he is capable of evoking fascinating atmosphere.
1,"Copia de otra historia, falta de imaginaciòn.","Sencillamente me decepcionó, esta historia es una copia burda delcuento ""Historia de los dos que soñaron"" de las 1001 noches, noche 351, del libro de Jorge Luis Borges en Historia Universal de la Infamia, lástima de toda la publicidad que recibe el señor Coelho, en su libro únicamente cambia los nombres de los personajes y los lugares, pero la trama es exactamente la misma."
5,simplemente el mejor!!!!,"soy fanatica de la buena lectura y este es el libro mas fascinante que e leido en toda mi vida,es un deber leerlo!!"
3,Inspiring story!,"I found the story of El AlQuimista interesting! The message I got is to keep focus in your goal no matter what you encounter in the process to achieve it. Also, it is good to stay ""present"" in every step in your way to reach your goal, because each one, is a learning experience. However, I found this book a basic reading. I guess the reason is because I had read so many interesting books about personal development that, I didn't find anything new. I recommend this book for beginners who want to learn about this topic."
1,Philosophy for stupid people,"Not ""philosphy for dummies"": we could all use a simple book that explains Kant and Plato and all the other deep thinkers. No, this is trite fluff masquerading as serious thought. Look, the message basically boils down to ""follow your dreams to find who you are."" That's a fortune from a cookie, not a novel! You get that free after your $4.95 lunch special! I realize that I sound churlish, but let's be specific: the characters (such as they are) have no clear personality, the prose is repetitive and there is basically no plot. Save your time and order in Chinese Food."
1,Get real !!!,This book is a useless piece of bad advice. If you wanna live in a fairy tale where everything can be considered some kind of stupid foreshadowing. Go ahead!
4,El Alquimista,I found it an interesting book. I like the way he plays with the language. This is the second book i read from him and i'm planning to read a few more.
5,Excellent book. A book that makes you think.,"A book with some very interesting concepts, and at the same time an eye opener. It is very well written and kept me interested. Made me think a lot about my own personal life and its direction. Strongly recommend it"
1,Oro de tontos,"Si lo que buscas es leer buena literatura, este libro no es la mejor elección. Una anécdota simple y base de toda novela de iniciación -un joven hombre en busca de sí mismo-, sirve al autor para transmitirnos una cierta filosofía cuyo principal lema es el lugar común de ""todos podemos llegar a ser lo que queremos"". Gracias, pero eso ya lo sabíamos (si quieren realmente informarse sobre esto no pierdan su tiempo y lean a Hermes Trismegisto).Ninguna innovación técnica, un estilo absolutamente plano, sólo un suspenso mantenido a lo largo del relato, para qué? para decirte al final eso: ""sí, dale, tú puedes llegar a ser lo que quieres"".La gran literatura brasileña, la de Euclides Da Cunha, la de Guimaraes Rosa, la de Jorge Amado no tiene en definitiva punto de comparación con la del charlatán de Coelho."
2,Decepcionante,"Si nos has leido temas de superacion personal, entonces puedes empezar por este libro. La calidad literaria del alquimista es pobre pero puedes empezar por aqui, sugiero no tomar muy en serio al autor quien la mayor parte de la trama idealiza al extremo. No planeo volver a leer temas de este autor."
4,neoyoriquino,"tengo casi 17 años de edad y este libro me cayó bien.no tengo mucha experiencia con literatura española porque mi primer idioma es inglés, incluso El Alquimista es la primera novela que he leído en español pero este libro me dejó satisfecho. tenía que leer el libro capítulo tras capítulo.por este libro tengo la inspiración para leer más libros en español. sólo me molestó una cosa, me gustaría más detalles porque el autor dice una cosa y no da detalles. muy interesante para una persona que quiere entretenerse con algo que impulsa a la mente sumergirse en el mundo escrito.una persona con dominio sobre el español terminará este libro en como 3 días porque no es más de 200 páginas y el autor no utiliza un vocabulario difícil ni figurativo.(pido perdón en antemano por errores con la gramática)"
5,"Welcome back to the full, lush sounds of prog performed well","Unacquainted with Jadis (or IQ...I was not listening to prog in the eighties), I purchased Fanatic on an impulse. What a great impulse! This album will astonish you. The pure musical sensibility of the band shines. Haunting melodies, firm handling of arrangements and zero ""filler."" The album flies directly in the face of pop music today, yet wisely nods to well-crafted songs of past pop.If you are considering an excursion into what could be a listening ""never-come-back"" experience, try on this bright, yet pensive, intelligent album."
1,"I was very, very disappointed!",The lids were broken and would not spray. The scent was milder not he same. I am not using it.
2,Poem not lyrical,"Because it is not packaged with an atomizer or sprayer, it will be hard to use. I would not have purchased it if I had realized it would not spray like by by initial purchase of Poem"
4,My favorite perfume!,Love the smell! Wish I had realized that it was a dab on and not a psray or I would have selected a different item. But the perfume is still the same and fantasic!
3,Worth it just for the ENSLAVED tracks...,"The main reason I bought this DVD was to have another round of ENSLAVED live performances on DVD. The ENSLAVED show does not disappoint if you are OK with just 3 songs from ""Below The Lights"" (which I love!). There are detailed biographies on each band and interviews with each band that are nicely done. Unfortunately, I don't really care for the other bands on here - only mildly interested in MSG and Soulfly. There are 3 Polish bands on here that I've never heard of, and everything else I would only watch once out of curiosity. BUT, if you are a big ENSLAVED fan or completist, I recommend adding this DVD to your collection."
1,Earmuffs uncomfortable,These earmuffs were very uncomfortable. The joint where the band meets the muffs digs into the side of your head. They also don't shape to your head very quickly after unfolding them.
1,Broke taking it out of the bag.,"I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. This I sure didn't, the thin plastic broke before I got it out of the bag good."
2,ear muffs for golf,I was so thrilled to find this type of earmuff instead of the ones that go behind your neck since I like to wear them to play golf and the other ones won't stay in place during the swing. I bought the more expensive ones thinking they would be better but the headband on my cheap ones never were sharp enough to cut my scalp like this one did. I would have been better off with 3 pair at $5 instead of 1 pair at $15.
4,Brilliant muzak,"I love Charlie Peacock's music. I think the man is a brilliant musician and an incredible producer.This instrumental-jazz album showcases some of the man's more offbeat brilliance. The songs are interesting, quirky, experimental. Unfortunately, for all their inventiveness, the songs also come across a little muzak-ish. They're great for background music while I'm doing other things, but I don't feel the urge to pop in this CD and just listen to it like I do with ""Strangelanguage"" or ""Everything That's on My Mind.""It's great that he's experimenting and going in directions unrestricted by the Christian-pop mainstream -- that's one of the things that's always made him stand out from the uninspired throng. For musical experimentation, this album is a winner. For musical enjoyment, this one might be a tad too experimental for me."
1,Useless. Don't buy.,"I bought this for a three week trip to Patagonia. I found it completely useless and threw it out. It doesn't show or label highways, railways, omits major towns, etc. Buy a better map or use the one in the many good guide books."
5,A fun and engaging workout,"A workout that you won't mind doing again and again. The included veil is convenient but be sure to have adequate space when practicing with it. (If space is a problem, practice the arm movements without the veil then take the veil outside or to a larger area to practice on your own.)"
3,For more advanced students,I like Dolphina. She's a talented dancer. I just could not keep up with this video. I am a very novice beginner and if you are a beginner please try Neena and Veena's series first. Once you have built up the arm strength I think this would be a fun workout.
5,Perfect Pitch!,"As a long time fan of Anita Diamant's work - THE RED TENT and then GOOD HARBOR, I was thrilled to see that a new one from Ms. Diamant was on the shelves! I bought it right away!PITCHING MY TENT was a fast read but one that I can see revisiting from time to time. In this compilation of articles and musings, the reader will get a real sense of what it was like for a woman who had choices and took chances - while her faith in Judaism and living a Jewish life blossomed!Written in such an honest and personal way, this book stirred many thoughts and emotions and really made me think about life.This is a book to give to the women in your life, messages that we will all identify with. It may even enourage you to pick up a pen and jot down some of your own memories!"
5,Delightful - Learned more about Judaism than I have ever known before...,"I picked up this collection of essays after reading ""The Red Tent"" which absolutely adored.Half-way through the book I thought, ""Converting to Judaism might be a good idea!"" I don't mean to jest about a serious subject...and it is Diamont's friendly, heartful, down to Earth tone (and the fact that she shares her being vis a vis her judaism)that makes me want to adopt some of her ways.I zipped through this book in record time, and I know I will read and re-read and give copies to many friends."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"Please do not misunderstand me, this is a good book but my expectations were way off. I think the Red Tent is one of the best books ever written, and Good Harbor and The Last Days of Dogtown are also brilliant but this book is very different. It is compiled of different articles Diamant has written over the years and yet the whole book seems to be focused almost entirely on Jewish life and customs. I must admit not being familiar these and so on many many pages I could barely follow where the article/book was going.Good book though, delightfully written and of course very insightful in some place with good giggles dotted about."
2,Almost not worth reading,"Coming off the total fabrication of the 'Red Tent' this collection of essays is simply a dirty mirror of the far more organized book they were made into. Capitlizing on interest in feminism and the Bible these essays serve up a cold plat eof fabrication and misinformation, mostly detailing the life of Dinah and her relations with other women of the tribe of Joseph, unfortunatly Dinah comes off as a harlot, and her friends as Pagans and idolworshipers full of a mishmash of psuedo-pagan religions, none of which actually existed at the time of Jacob but this book simply fakes these other religions pretending that the women in the Red Tent would have resorted to heathen barbarism when not in the presence of Jacob and his sons. The reality is that no acts of human sacrifice or the bleeding of cats took place among the women of Jacobs family and since none took place this read is mere conjecture."
4,Great songs,"I enjoyed the songs. Great oldies for xmas! Classic Soul Ballads: Christmas. Also, great turnaround for order."
4,great and cheap,this book teaches you how to paint faces very good .befor having this book i did not know it is so easy to paint a face .i paint my children face and body few times a week by this wich is fast and cheap.
1,Don't waste your money,The paintings in this book were of very poor quality. Some were even smeared. Couldn't wait to send this back.
2,"childish, but OK","If you are serious about learning about face painting and making effects, this book IS NOT FOR YOU. I found it to be childish . There isn't as many ideas either. The pictures in the book looked to be slopply done. But I do like the paints. Goes on easy and cleans up easy."
2,"fun ideas, bad paints","My friend used these paints to do make a design on her arm and it took three days to wash off! The book has a great concept and great ideas, but I would recommend using different face paints."
5,A great value!,This is a great book for beginners. Easy to understand instructions with designs that kids love. The paints are non-toxic and come off easily. I have had this book a long time and have gotten a lot of milage out of it. I definitely recomend it for any age! (:
4,A good value.,"In truth, I am a pennypincher. And I balked at the thought of paying close to $20 for this book and paint set. HOWEVER, I have found it be worth every penny. It was a birthday present for a girl about to turn 6, but it has proven a huge hit with her big brother and sister (8 and 10) , a little sister (2) and many many friends. Also, the paints Klutz packages with the book are lovely - their colors are vivid and the makeup is easy to remove."
1,"NOT FOR YOU IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ""REAL"" INSTRUCTIONS","I'm not impressed. Don't get me wrong, there are some cute ideas in the book but no detailed instructions. Their idea of instructions are: 1 - Draw outline. 2 - Create Whiskers. 3 - Fill in. I would have liked it to say 1 - Begin drawing the outline by starting 3 inches above the cheekbone and make a curved line....and so on. Since I'm not a creative person by nature I really wanted more instructions. This is simply a book of ideas and heck, you can get that without the book! I'm disappointed."
3,Starter book,I dont really have 20 words for this book. Its a starter book for sure. Of you are just starting out or are like just painting faces as a once in a while kind of thing this is a fine book. I was looking for more.
1,Don't bother,"What a letdown. I could do better as a beginner or not even bother. It shouldn't matter that it's a ""klutz"" book or geared toward a child, the examples were boring and very basic, not to mention poorly done."
4,i was afraid,"i was afraid that this album was gonna be too much for me; i only recogniced 4-5 songs that i already owned, but listening to it twice & 3 times, the music started to catch. i don't like the submission that leroy burguess had to take to co-produce BIG TIME with rick james. i know better leroy burgess. the shortest song in the whole compilation DATE WITH THE RAIN is the best. the supremes rock, so thelma houston, but dianna ross, i have her double remastered diana album & there she has a 10 minute version of LOVE HANGOVER, also i have the full album THE BOSS,in wich it comes the full long version of THE BOSS & in the double diana there's a mix of NO ONE GET'S THE PRICE/THE BOSS 9.30+.carl bean, teena marie, switch with jermaine jackson,jerry buttler,all of them with catchy tunnes that will make a delight to own this collection"
3,"good book, bad support","Great book . Unfortunately, the CD rom is for windows 2000, and not upgradable to XP , let alone 7. Wiley seems to have little interest in helping. A little support would be appreciated."
3,Decent,"Good cover.thinner then OEM. Looks good. Bolts supplied are not compatible for install. They are Too long. But for the price, it's an excellent cover. A little concerned on the chrome rusting in a year or so but you pay for what you get."
3,An Unfortunate Trend,"While I did enjoy this book quite a bit, as I always do enjoy Peter David stories, I do have one complaint. There is an unfotunate trend appearing the last few years, in not only Star Trek, but the sci-fi genre as a whole. Multi-book stories are a great source of enjoyment. The trend of making the important and final books Hardcover! Most of the time , the story length doesn't even warrant it. There is one important reason for this...Greed! Greed by the publisher, who knows if you read books 1-3 you will shell out major coin to see how the story ends. And they say that greed doesnt exist in the Star Trek universe...well they never got conned into unnecessary , overpriced books."
1,cd contains bad ebooks,"I bought this book due to the cd containing ebook versions of other NF stories. I have never read and NF and that this would be a great deal. Unfortunately not all the ebooks display correctly and they have formatting problems and pages missing. After I bought this, the publisher said this is a known problem due to a new version of adobe. The fix is to find an old adobe program and use that. The only problem is we're not going to be able to do that for long as that older program won't work on newer operating systems. If ebooks aren't made to be permanent, so I can reread a book in the future, they ought to be a lot cheaper."
1,I agree with the reader from new albany,I have not read this book yet. It is only available in hardcover. I am a stay at home mom with children. Hard cover book are out of my price range. When will publishers learn?
4,for my daughter,"i got this book for my daughter we like the author, but she felt this one was a bit lame, so sorry not the greatest review, but im goin by her words."
3,Murphy's Friend,This book was interesting for me to read. Ms. Hayden gave a great presentation in this book. I felt I really got to know Kevin as a character. The way Torrey delt with Kevin when he wasn't talking. She kept her hopes up. I would just get frustrated. This book is really emotional. I really got into the story. I felt I was right their with Kevin pushing him to talk. The whole time I was talking while reading; saying Come on Kevin. Just talk. I recommend this book to teens. It's not boring at all. I could read it for hours at a time.
4,will make you angry,"Teacher Torey Hayden takes an unusual case, a fifteen year old boy named Kevin who doesn't speak, or is ""electively mute."" With Torey's help, Kevin begins to speak again. His progress at the hospital, however, is erratic because of horrifying circumstances that brought him into custodial care. His sister was beaten to death by their alcoholic father, and the father also physically abused Kevin, and urged his sisters to abuse him sexually as well.As one might expect,the road to recovery is not smooth at all. Kevin is given several placements with foster parents and other caretakers which do not work out. However, with Torey's aid, Kevin begins taking small steps toward becoming independent. In the end, he goes to high school and survives the academic and social challenges. He also finds a group home that caters to mentally disabled adults and does well there. An inspiring story."
2,where's the spark?,"I'm sorry to say but this book was agreat dissapointment for me. I've read two other books by Hayden, but I really missed the spark in this book. Maybe because it's her 1st one, but still, I love her."
3,Disappointing,"""If that wasn't the portrait of a loser, I didn't know what would be"" (17). This statement comes at the end of a twenty-nine line paragraph describing Kevin Richter's case history. After just hearing Hayden outline the difficulties this boy has been through, I was a little angry at this sentence. After reading all of Dave Pelzer's books as well as many of Beatrice Spark's, her choice of words seems inappropriate. Although the entire book does not contain this negativity, I couldn't forget it as I turned each page. Borrow this one from the library."
1,I have to ask was this item returned previously?,The items has a tacky dirty feel. Something is missing from the pump. The packaging was askew. I have to ask was this item returned previously?
3,Too squishy,"I have another medium green Gaiam ball that I got at Target that is firmer than this. This ball is very squishy, which may be for some, but I prefer a firmer ball."
4,Solid guide to security for the systems administrator,"This thick security tome is a practical guide to security that seems ideally suited to systems administrators. There is a brief introduction to general security issues, then eleven chapters that cover tools and techniques. These include packet sniffing, data encryption, wireless security. An overall soup to nuts guide to practical security.This book doesn't go from computer science theory and architecture, it starts with descriptions of the problems very close to the metal (often times showing packet layouts), and then covers point by point use of open source software to fix the holes.The text is well written, if a little stiff, and the graphic are not overused but are not as sparse as O'Reilly. I recommend this book for Systems Administrators looking for a step by step guide to using open source security tools."
3,Living with Diabetes,"Not enough information/detail on her life as a diabetic. Focused too much on her Miss America experiences, without including how she handled her diabetes while Miss America."
3,Was great while it lasted,This did a great job and was accurate so my plants loved it but it didn't take long before it fell apart but I guess you sort of expect that when you get things made in China.
1,one ware,I wore these shoes for one day and the ripped right at the top flower!! Now I am VERY careful with my shoes because I LOVE my feet and Shoes! No wonder they come with patches! I was very disappointed!! I also bought another pair and have yet to ware them!
2,"Cute and comfortable, but not durable","I like these sandals, but after the first day of wearing them, the soles cracked. Fortunately, they came with a repair kit of stickers, but the sticckers are starting to come off too (after only a few weeks). If you just want to wear them around the beack or pool infrequently, they're fine, but any amount of walking seems to be too much for them to hanldle."
5,Eye Opening,"Penn & Teller have always been masters of illusion, so who better than they to debunk other illusionists...only it's not other magicians they're uncovering, it's everyday scam artists that many in today's society accept as ""experts."""
5,awesome baby,"P & T are back for a second season and its even better than the first. Let me just say that this show isn't for everyone, but if you're open minded then you might like it. One of my favorite episodes out of season two is the one where they call out the bs in the bible. Hey when you've been in the clutches of religion like I have and have been abused by the so called holier than thou idiots, then you've got a reason to hate it. And I do love it when P & T rag on religion! LOL."
3,"Blunt, brutal, honest and funny","Although I disagree with a few things they ""expose,"" I have to say that Penn & Teller's brutal honesty about everything they discuss is extremely appealing; and extremely funny.I will say that this series is on ""Showtime"" for a reason. It is not to be watched by children. Although hosted by magicians; no magic is performed. This is very much an adult show; filled with profanity, nudity, and a lot of other things you don't want your kids seeing/hearing. For an adult with an open mind, this series is great fun and makes you think about things you probably haven't thought of before. I have laughed the whole way through; enjoying this season as much as Season 1."
3,"Folks, it's merely entertainment.","I think P and T are funny and I enjoy this show, but it is aptly titled. If you think this is intended to actually give any of these issues or factions are fair gander, you likely believe that all news is fact. It's all edited to reach the same debunking conclusion, and Penn is gonna come out on top, WAY on top, no matter what he ""examines"". There is little to no empathy, or attempts to understand anything. I don't enjoy the endless ""look at how weird this is"" angles, but overall it is fun. At least Teller is smart enough to keep his mouth shut..."
5,Great service & product,I received my product very quickly and it was in excellant condition.Awesome!
1,Penn & Teller - a different perspective,"The second season contained an episode about the Bible. One of the people interviewed on the show, Professor Paul Maier, wrote later that he was outraged at how Penn & Teller edited his words. The net result is that he appeared on the show to endorse ideas that he actually opposes. The link to his comments is here:http://www.concordtx.org/msnews/maier2.htmYou might want to take Penn & Teller in a different light. They are *not* objective, if this situation is any example. The viewer does *not* see what falls to the cutting room floor, only what they want you to see. Some healthy skepticism is well advised."
4,"A beautiful book, poorly constructed","The first 1/3 of this book was 5 stars: excellent characters, a great scenario and - as always with Harrison - plain wonderful language. But, then it went on. And on. And on. The story basically goes nowhere until the final pages. This would have been an amazing 250 page book. Not only did it run on, but it was - I felt - poorly edited. Many words and phrases were repeated far more than they should have been. Finally, quite a few typos in the Kindle edition. Take it as a tribute to the author, that I read through the plodding sections, because - even when a bit slow - Harrison's language is engaging."
3,A little disappointing,"While I am a big Jim Harrison fan, this book was a little disappointing in that it was a strained attempt at complex psychoanalysis which, frankly, got boring! No doubt Harrison is an artful writer, yet the web of relationships was so overwhelming in this book that you needed a diagram to sort through them all. The main theme seemed to be the moral bankruptcy of the protagonist's father but every single relationship from that one to his love for his dog dragged on and on. His relationships with all the women in his life as well as the men could have been novels standing alone.This book did not measure up to Harrison's masterpieces, like A Good day to die or Legends of the Fall."
3,A long short story,"Jim Harrison is a wonderful writer as he demonstrated in ""Dalva"" and ""Legends of the Fall.""In ""True North"" Harrison again writes well but the story is not worth his effort.The book is long (more than 400 will-it-ever-end? pages) and the story is shallow. Other reviewers, in a paragraph or two, reveal the plot. It is over before it begins because the ending is at the front of the book.The main character tries to expiate guilt about ancestral gluttony and perversion by -- you'd never guess -- writing about it.It's a woodsy bad dad-goofy son yarn tarted up with campfire-tale sex episodes.Harrison's skillful discriptions and observations remind of his enormous talent, but the story is so trivial and unreal even Harrison can't puff it up into a blaze.(...)"
2,This is the TRUE north?,"I have just finished the book - perhaps 2 months. Kept hoping for some redeeming quality, but it never came. I thoroughly agree with Gary Mack, but cannot see why he gives it 4 stars. Carla was the best character in the story."
4,Loved it.,"As I was reading True North, my wife asked what it was about. Always a difficult answer for a Harrison book. My answer: It's about this guy named David, and I'm really going to miss him once I'm finished."
2,Meandering and dull,"Initially this seemed like a well written and compelling novel but after about 100 pages it became disjointed, uninteresting, and as unfocused as the protagonist. The writing was also a bit sloppy; for instance the author did not keep track of his own timeline. The protagonist takes his nephews to the zoo and professes not to be good with children at a point where these ""children"" should be in their late teens. All in all not worth the time."
5,good little knife,"Nice knife, long enough but slim so it fits in pocket comfortably. Seems solid and well put together. Price is right."
3,Nice looking bu dangerous,Looks nice and feels just right in size for a useful and powerful pocket knife. Built well. The only complaint is that opening and closing the knife does not offer a smooth motion and I just know that one day I am going to ge nailed by this bad boy.
3,"Pretty, but scratches easily","We really like the shape, size, and style of this ring, and how shiny it was--at first. I've been wearing it for less than a month, and it already has numerous notable scratches all over it. We were not expecting it to be so easily damaged at this level of gold count."
5,Excellent Aid!,"The charts in this book are what makes it so effective and helpful. Once again Gilbert's has provided law students with a great teaching aid and exam study guide. The questions in the back are very good, but beware 1L's in your first semester not having all of the information necessary to fully answer the questions.The charts in this book are fantastic and are not to be missed! A must have for law students!"
5,Gilberts does not disappoint,"The Gilbert books are great. The rules are clearly stated in these books. Also, the book is extremely helpful when it comes time to outline courses."
1,Is this a hoax.,I have sent in my review of this book twice! Since it was not favorable am I to assume you do not print unfavorable reviews? I usually rely on your customer reviews and often buy books that don't necessarily have glowing reviews. It makes me wonder whether I should still buy from Amazon.
4,The Rabbit Joke,"Anybody that is a Poco fan knows about the rabbit joke. The rabbit joke appears at the end of last song on this CD. Dont turn it off after the song is finished, let it keep running and about 20 seconds later, Rusty Young tell his rabbit joke"
4,Pretty good blues,The Dan Coy Trio is a Atlanta based blues band that plays nice tunes foreasy listening. The musicians are professional and enchant the listener with popular tunes from jazz and blues giants in an unmistakeble interpretation. Fun to listen to.
5,"Masterfully, unquestionably, Lovecraftian !","This collection of dark, unworldly, horror highlights the myriadof talents which set H.P.Lovecraft apart from his contemporaries.The true master of the macabre again demonstrates his uncanny abilityto draw the reader into his haunting mythos and never miss a beat.Cthulhu comes alive ..too bad for us."
1,"the right stuff, in a wrong setting","I happen to own the set of paperbacks of which this is part. They are poorly edited, and ill printed on crummy paper. It also happens that the set prints several stories twice, and forgets some of HPL's not so minor works. A publisher who gives this kind of treatment to a writer and to prospective customers doesn't deserve your money.this volume's best redeeming feature is the inclusion of two of my favorite HPL tales : ""At the Mountains of Madness"" and ""The Statement of Randolph Carter"" but in the light of the existence of better edited, printed and organized collections, this falls short of being enough for me to recommend itIf you like HPL, or just want to discover his works, do yourself and the publishing industry a favor, get your book somewhere else, there are some better collections and omnibuses around, just waiting for you."
3,influential,"HP Lovecraft is the type of writer who is prominent because of his influence on other writers and the importance of his ideas to the genre, rather than for skill in writing. 'At the Mountains of Madness' is a perfect example of this. The ideas of the 'Old Ones' and other elements of the Cthulhu mythos, have had enourmous influence on other horror writers, but the writing itself can be a bit of a chore to wade through.'At the Mountains of Madness' comprises the bulk of this volume; the other ""tales of terror"" are: 'The Shunned House', 'The Dreams in the Witch House' and 'The Statement of Randolph Carter'. I actually enjoyed the ""The Shunned House' and 'The Dreams of the Witch House' more than 'At the Mountains of Madness' which I think just dragged too much at times.Lovecraft's style can take some getting used to, but one can't deny the the importance and influence of his ideas."
4,TALES OF FEAR,"a NOVEL, A FILM,ANY PIECE OF WORK, WHEREVER IT TAKES PLACE,WHATEVER IT SHOWS, IT ALWAYS RESEMBLES SOMETHING THAT HAS PRIMARILY TO DO WITH US, OUR SOCIETY, OUR PSYCHE, THE STRUCTURE WE LIVE IN, THAT SURROUND US AND THAT WE FORM. lOVECRAFT, TELLS THE STORY OF HOW eco-COMPUTERS TOOK OVER AND SUBSEQUENTELY, DESTROYED THE CIVILIZATION THAT FOUND THEM. tHIS BOOK IS A THRILL! iT IS NOT SO MUCH AN ACCOUNT OFTHIS OLD, GREAT CIVILIZATION DEPICTED IN THE STORY, IT IS ABOUT OUR OWN FEARS, OUR MADNESS.rEAD IT!"
2,Boring,"...I thought his use of language was very layered and rich, if not even quite dated. It took me a couple chapters just to get the lingo down. I think the writing style here is quite dry and the story is only maddening in the sense that it bored my socks off. I kept reading with the expectation that it would pick up, and when I got 95% done I was expecting some fantastically creepy ending that would make up for such monotonous content. Again, I was disappointed. This book might give a 6yr old the chills but it certainly didn't do it for me, nor did it entertain me."
5,Lovecraft's schizophrenic ramblings and the Necronomicon,"Howard Phillips Lovecraft is kinda sorta a bad writer, and he kinda sorta throws obscure pre-revolutionary era words at the reader which amount to an elaborate nothingness, and his bizarrenesses are kinda sorta the things a sexually repressed thirteen year old would think up, but I kinda sorta like him anyway! I'd recommend L. Sprague de Camp's biography of him, if it wasn't out of print. (Oh yeah, I should mention that despite what the title of this review says, Lovecraft was (probably) not insane . . . just a little eccentric.)"
4,Good but twisted,"Lovecraft isn't really my sort of thing, but I thought I should at least read one of two of his stories to get some idea of his work. I happened to find this book cheap and read the title story and some of the short stories. At the Mountains of Madness seems to be considered his best. I have to admit, I enjoyed it more than I would have thought, as Lovecraft is a talented but twisted storyteller in a bizarre sort of way. Also, hearing about all these obscure gods with Sumerian and Babylonian sounding names (I guess they do come from their mythology) and finding about what they are about is sort of interesting, actually. Anyway, Lovecraft is a certainly a master of the macabre and the bizarre who can give you a pretty good scare for your money."
2,I'm really sorry,"I'm really sorry. I tried so hard to enjoy this book. But the fact is that this is the longest, most boring, complicated, overdone book I've ever read. Had to go over 2 or 3 times on the same page to get the picture of what Mr. Lovecraft wanted to describe. It's terribly overdone.If you want something TERROR, you can read ""The Adventures of Arthur Gordon Pym"" by Edgar Allan Poe, and believe me, you will get your fix of starvation, murder, cannibalism, sorrow and regret. All in the only ""novel"" or long story written by Mr. PoeI WILL READ AGAIN ""At the Mountains of Madness"", sometime in the near future. Right now I can only say that is a slow, boring read.Lovecraft or not.Cheers!!!"
2,"The stories are great, but............","I'm a big fan of HPL and try to get everything out by him. But i must say that there are many better one-volume introduction to HPL out there right now. Try The Call of Cthulhu (Penguin Modern Classics)The Call of Cthulhu (Penguin Modern Classics)This is imho the best introduction to HPL.The stories get 5 stars, this volume gets 2."
5,The terrible researches of Harley Warren,"""At the Mountains of Madness"" is good and ""Dreams in the Witch-House"", but the real gem in this collection is the three page story ""The Statement of Randolph Carter"". Other reviewers have discussed its plot, so I won't say much except that I think Harley Warren, the one in the story who doesn't come up alive, is one of Lovecraft's best characters. He is portrayed very vividly and comes off as a man who is infused with an insatiable curiosity, but at the same time realizes that what he is pursuing his dangerous to himself. He also shows him as a self-sacrificial character who sacrificed his life for Carter.Three cheers for you, Harley Warren, and for Mr. Lovecraft who brought him to life!"
2,Pop up tie,"I am a stand up comedian and use the pop up tie as a gag. It works okay, but had to be modified to make it work properly. Also the ad is misleading in that you do have to pull a string to operate it."
5,"If you love golf, you'll love this","I first read this book when it was published in the 1990's. I have wanted to read it again since then, and recently was given the name and author from an old friend who leant it to me. If you appreciate humor, and just downright telling it like it is - the joy of the game, the agony of bad shots, the empathy we have for each other and the admiration for beauty and nature, and just life on its challenging courses, then this is the book for you. In fact, next month I plan to go to Taos, NM to play the course I have dreamed about playing for over a decade. Highly recommended."
3,A good read,This is an exceptionally well written enjoyable book to read on a rainy afternoon when you can't get out to the course. The only downer were periodic eruptions of Hallberg's boomer arrogance. Also disappointing was the fact he told all his golf partners that he was writing a book and he was going to put them in it!
2,You won't find the soul of golf here!!,"This book should have been called ""Me and My Neon"". I didn't find anything new in this book. It was too verbose and ran on a little too long. I didn't like the author's style. All I kept asking myself was why go on this pointless trip with all the problems back at home"
2,Well crafted prose reveals poor personal values.,"William Hallberg brings us many insightful, poignant and well crafted passages about golf, companionship, and his personal biography. Unfortunately, his efforts get lost in what seems to be more a soul searching than the soul of golf. While reading passages about a wide range of courses, companions and rounds of golf so well written that I felt I could almost hear him speaking, I was, at the same time, deeply troubled that what sounds like caring man would neglect meaningful, adult responsibilities and relationships in favor of a traveling golf fantasy and potential book sale earnings. Ultimately, for me the Soul of Golf became more a story of how a man with wonderful literary, golfing and, by his own account, interpersonal skills bemoans his well earned guilt about leaving the sufferings of several family members behind in pursuit of what is, after all, a game. Ultimately, I think it missed it's mark."
1,"Birdie on descriptions of golf, double bogey on the rest.","I looked so forward to reading this book after it was recommended by a friend, also an avid links lover. However, getting past the authors liberal genre and his views towards certain people of the ""christian"" persuasion left me disappointed. As a Christian, I wish I could have read the book without the typical liberal diatribe of ""religion-bashing"" and received more inspiration of how one can learn of life through the study and playing of the game. Too much of a slice to the left side of center for me. Bill, just stick to the vivid and well laid out descriptions of the course and leave the anti-christian prosletizing to someone else (that is, if you want to sell books.) Can I get my money back?"
3,Good book for locating known species of birds,This book is good if you already know your birds. It doesn't have photos or descriptions of birds. It tells you where you are likely to find a species. It's no good if you want to know what that bird is in your backyard.
4,Lap suit,I like the Ocean product. It is well made and thoughtfully constructed. I prefer a suit that has the clasp at the back and ordered two of the same model with the clasp. The size 16 could be a little shorter in the torso as I'm only 5'1....mostly legs....but I feel that this suit/product will suit your needs (sic.).I am pleased with the shipping/delivery and will recommend this seller.
5,Excellent lap suit!,"I was a little concerned when I purchased this item as I've never owned a suit made by this manufacturer before. I liked the style of the suit, however, and the price was too good to pass up so I ordered it.My worries quickly vanished after trying it on. The suit is a perfect fit. It doesn't need to be adjusted what-so-ever and is quite comfortable. I swim three times a week so suit stability and comfort were very important to me. So far, I've noticed no wear and tear and it washes well. I've only had it for about a month, so we'll see how it stands up to chlorine.I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid, moderate lap suit."
2,Size too small,In my opinion the suit is not true to size. I have tried on many suits in my size and they all fit with the exception of this one. Had to return it for another style.
4,Cranium Balloon Lagoon,"Popular game in our house for 5 and 6 year olds. Easy to set up and gets played enough. Frog pond is a little frustrating but they love making the frogs jump. All in all, a good game."
3,Balloon Lagoon,This game is fun for kids and parents to play together. The game moves quickly. Some smaller kids might have trouble with some of the hand-eye coordination aspects of the game.
5,Very entertaining,"we received the gift at Christmas, trying to find a game both a 4 and 5 year old could play, they both loved it! It's a great game highly recommended, not much on the educational value though."
4,Balloon Lagoon rocks!,"My son received this toy for Christmas. He LOVES it! It is so much fun. It has four different activities and each one has to be completed in a certain amount of time. It is fast and fun. Only problem is that the assembly of the game comes apart during the play. The base comes together like a big cardboard puzzle. Maybe if the base was made of plastic and snapped together it would stay together. Even so, it still provides hours of fun for the little guy and mommy and daddy have fun with it itoo!"
3,balloon lagoon gets old fast--too simple,"I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old kids. We played it a few times and then they lost interest. It just isn't challenging enough and the more you play it, the more it stays the same.Depending on what the spinner lands on, you either pull magnetic letters up from a ""pond"" with a fishing pole to spell a word; pop plastic frogs into a pond with your finger; roll dice to get matches; or press a button to spin cubes (similar to slot machine action) to form a picture.My kids quickly mastered the simple skills required for this game and became bored. Me too."
4,"Great fun and learning, if it wouldn't fall apart.","This game is a great option for the 5 to 8 year old range. The games are fun (if a little simplistic for adults) and a lot of different areas are addressed. Fine motor skills are excercised in the frog jump. Spelling and letter recognition in letter lake. Matching and pre-reading recognition skills are addressed in snack shack and tumbling sholls. I don't think this game if very sturdy, though. We have had this game less than a month and already the board pieces are not connecting with the center piece. A little bit frustrating, but the game is still playable."
5,Cranium does it again,"At our house, we love the cranium games. We have 2 boys (6 and 8) and they have fun with it. My 6 year old loves it more than my 8 year old. He loves the music of the carousel and he doesn't get frustrated with it. He always wants to play with everyone. This is for sure his favorite game!!"
4,Fun for the whole family!,"Great game! Fun and educational. The music can be a much after a while, but that's part of the game.My daughter is 3 1/2 and she picked up on this game immediately!My only complaint is that the little purple game pieces that hold the balloons are not designed well. The balloons need to be crammed into them so tightly that it's virtually impossible to use as intended."
4,Family fun!,With kids of varying ages between 5-7 there are challanges that fit each one. Lot's of fun. Things to touch - not just a piece moving around a board.
3,Pieces,"Lots of little pieces. Kids don't like to pick up the little pieces, but sure love to scatter them all over. When my grandkids (ages 4&5) go home, I am left with the pieces. I don't like this game."
5,Great game for everyone,"I just purchased this game for my 3-1/2 year old son, based on other reviews. This is by far our favorite game now (of course, it's still new). But it's educational, builds motor skills, and is a lot of fun. I'm not sure why it's rated for kids 5-7, since my son caught onto the games immediately. Well worth whatever price they are asking."
4,Great Game?Durability Questionable,"This is a great game! I have 3 kids ranging in age from 3-7 and everyone has a great time playing. The durablity of the the ""letter fishing pond"" lasted only 3-5 playing times, though. The rubber closure on the ""pond"" that hides the letters ripped and the fishing pole tip w/ the magnet broke, after only having the game 2 days. But the kids constantly ask to play the game. They have such great fun!"
4,Cranium Balloon Lagoon,"My kids love this game! The board sometimes comes apart when moved, but otherwise excellent. The music is infectious, but not annoying. Fun for all ages; challenging enough for my 7 year old, but simple enough for my 5 year old."
3,It made me want to meet the author.,"This was the first book by Woiwode I read. Despite some flaws it was compelling enough to make me want to seek out and read other of his works. ""What I'm Going to Do, I Think"" is still his best novel, but this one had its moments. Chris ""helping"" the farmer with his haying is hilarious."
4,Fun kit to get back into modeling,"I loved these as a kid and figured I would try the larger 1/100 scale as a start back into the modeling hobby. This kit is more durable than the smaller kit, but as with all plastic models is still rather fragile. The gundam is made from colored but would benefit from some detail painting. The included figure is unpainted/uncolored as well. Definitely a great display item though."
5,Top Quality,"Heavy - steel and copper. Thats what counts in a charger and this one has both. Don't buy the lightweights from China. Made in Mexico, but its an old standby US design.OKAY its a year later... this one died early on - they sent a new one after I retutned the bad one. That one died too. They quickly sent another without any return needed, and the rep sounded like he was Po'd at his company for allowing so much junk to go out the door. Now I have two working and one dead for spare parts, and even after the hassle these are still the most for the least on the market. You only other option is sears, and they appear to be made by Schumaker also, or harbor freight which should send its electric stuff with a death certificate."
4,Amazon.com needs to proof read there ads and stop cut & paste,"I am so mad at Amazon the text below is so wrong, Amazon needs to stop cutting and pasting there ad's and hire someone that knows the product there advertising. see errors below.Product Features* A 6 function rotary switch prevents overcharging* Made for 6 and 12-volt batteries* 75-amps help emergency engine starting* 12-amp fast charge charges batteries in 2-5 hrs; 2-amp trickle charger charges batteries in 2-12 hrs* 2 LED lights display charge statusThe text above is not correct (Product features) (1) there is not a 6 function switch on this model. (2) this is not capable of charging 6 volt system. The photo is not current to the model there selling. I bought based on the text above and now I do not have the time to return before Christmas and will not be buying again from amazon due to there gross negligence on there advertisement . The gift now dose not have the functions desired by recipient. Thanks a lot Amazon ( Morzons )"
3,6 month review - unit dead,"Used sparingly on a few fresh batteries run down by parasitic drain, mostly 2-amp and 12-amp charges. Worked fine.Unit died at 6 months, and was replaced under warranty, however, return shipping by UPS Ground was not covered and cost $21.00.Customer Service took one week to review the return before electing to replace it. Return shipping by FedEX was covered.Overall, I am satisfied that the company honored it's product and warranty. I did need to follow up with Customer Service, but they were timely and responsive by email at each request for update.Unit is made in Mexico, for those that follow country of origin.As an aside, my next purchase for a portable jump starter will be with a competitor, primarily because it offers an accessible battery that can be replaced by a skilled person. Unfortunately, Schumacher does not provide that."
4,"12 volt only, not for 6 volt as in the Amazon product desription","As of January 13, 2008, Amazon's product description for the 1275A claims that it outputs either 12 or 6 volts. This is incorrect. The product charges 12-volt systems only, as stated on the box and very clearly in the user's manual. The charger *looks* very well-made, and the review system makes me give it a rating, but really I can't comment on overall quality because I needed a 6-volt charger and had to send it back without using it."
4,way hot !!,Loved it. The action is non stop-the romance was steamy...I have already purchased the next one!
4,I like it On The Brink!,"Awesome. Pretty much stayed on the edge of my seat . . Suspense/Covert assignment/male n female hero co stars . . Well developed 3-D characters . . Two (-or 3) intensely hot love scenes . . .quite realistic . . made for the movies . . my one drag is not sure just how they fell in love - - both had trust issues . . but that's how that type of work probl. is, for real! Anyway even with the slight shortcoming it was a really good read!"
2,Lots of action,This is the first book that I have read by this author. After reading a lot of the reviews I purchased this in hopes of a good action romance. There was a lot of action but not near enough romance (IMO). I would've preferred a lot more interaction between Alexa and Killian but of course that would then have changed the story. The story had numerous characters and I found it a bit difficult to keep track of them all. Perhaps all of the secondary characters were needed in order to set up the series.
4,GREAT,"Even if these are late recordings, even if (among the late albums) Deep Blues is better, this is, with its twin album ""Last of The Jelly Roll Kings"", a great evidence of the most pure Delta blues... IN THE 90s! Frank and Sam play like they did when they were young, in the 50s and 60s, and Frank's Voice is not wrecked at all. The blues is here, don't go further!"
1,Warning,"Be very careful - these sticks come with a 90-day limited warranty - because they are remanufactured/refurbished. Doesnot say on the packaging - and could jam in your camera, whichwas my experience. Buyer beware."
5,"So far, awesome!","What a dream to be able to take so many pictures without running to the PC to download them & delete them from the camera! The only downside, is you can find yourself taking too many.... And the SONY DSC72 doesn't make it easy to delete them quickly from the camera."
5,Cheap and Excellent,"Initially when I saw this product I was thinking whether to buy Memory sticks on brands other than Sony. I just had my Sony Clie and I wanted to get the largest possible memory sticks available. Lexar sells their sticks about half the price of Sony. So I bought it (actually a few), and I have absolutely no problems with it. No files have been lost on the stick (I have used it for more than half a year), and the access speed is OK too. Packaging is excellent, takes forever to rip it open though :p With this price it is definitely worth while."
5,As good as Sony,"I purchased this item to suppliment other memory cards for my Sony DSC camera. It operates exactly the same as the Sony, and for substantially less cost. Recommend this product highly to anyone seeking additional storage for their Sony products."
1,"Will not ""lock"" in place in Sony camera","I purchased the Lexar 128MB memory stick and was disappointed that it will not lock in place in the Sony DSC-P1 digital camera, it just pops back out so the door to the memory/battery compartment cannot be closed. I have 2 Sony memory sticks that work fine. The few dollars saved over Sony brand memory were not worth not having enough memory to take photos at family wedding when discovering the new memory stick would not stay in the camera."
3,Cannot be read by certain Card Reader,I have a Sandisk 128MB Memory Stick which works well on both my Sony CLIE PDA and Card Reader. But this Lexar Media MS cannot be read by my TravelReader CRW-600 Multi-Card Reader/Writer.
4,"Memory Stick works well, bad packaging","-1 Star for really Spartan packaging, the stick almost slipped out of the box!! Wanted to make sure it worked, so plugged it in and it worked fine. Did not feel a time lag due to the high capacity - had heard someone say something like that.It will be a while before I can fill this stick up, will update review if something untoward happens. So far, incredible deal and works just fine."
5,Good and not expensive.,"It's way cheaper than the original Memory sticks, and it works flawlessly. I use it with a Sony Clié NR70V handheld, and there has been no problem. 128 Mb was enough space to store 2 video clips, 8 mp3 files, more than 200 pictures and there was still some space left for software."
1,"Not Made Anymore. You will be sent something different, as I was.","Anyone purporting to sell you this as brand new is lying. These haven't been made in a number of years. I bought one off Amazon and was sent something different. Then, they admitted to me that they weren't made anymore, which I knew but figured that the manufacturer had started to make them again, since a company from New York was apparently selling them off Amazon. I don't buy from deceitful companies trying to sell in a fraudulent manner. If you buy a used one off Craigs List - lucky you."
5,As Good as Memory Stick,"I bought 2 of these to use with my Sony Digital Camera, and I can't tell the difference between the Sony Memory Stick and Lexar's. Even Sony USB Reader recognizes this instantly. I highly recommend this product, good quality at almost half the price of Memory Stick."
2,Only 90 Day WARRANTY,"I have just received this product and noticed it only has a limited 90 day warranty. This is very unusual because the other Lexar 128mb memory I have looked at or purchased has a 5 year warranty. Why the short warranty? Does this product have known defects? Before purchase, read the fine print."
3,Performance as expected,"It is a memory stick, there is not much to say about it. It did not fail or destroy any of my data, which is about all you can say about such products. I'm still a little hesitant about this price point for the product, in comparison to other formats 128 MB is starting to become a very small amount. One note: it is not translucent purple as it appears in the image, it is the dull purple-blue of all of the other Sony memory sticks."
4,Not made in the same assembly line.,"Sony and SanDisk Memory Stick are both made in Japan, and they seem to both have the same packaging quality. Lexar on the other hand is made in Singapore and packaging quality seems to be lower than Sony's. Have you compared toys made from Japan and those made from China? Anyway, this has a 5 year warranty and I was able to easily speak with a live customer service representative at Lexar."
2,Not compatible with extreme light situations,"The Lexar 128 mb memory stick matches up in most cases to the Sony memory stick that originally came with my camera, but clearly fails in low light or very bright situations. I've reverted to buying a larger Sony memory stick...."
2,Parents should know before buying,Any parents concerned about their young toddlers or children viewing guns on television may not want to purchase this video. When Pooh is scared at night he gets out his pop gun and starts pacing with it on his shoulder ready to protect himself from any intruders. I was very disappointed in this video.
4,Who doesn't love the Road Warrior?,"This is an awsome movie. Most call it the best of the Mad Max movies (I say the 3rd one is) It's got a great plot, lots of super fast action, and memerable characters. There are some disturbing scenes in this film (fingers being severed for example) so be warnedThe Trailers and the ""Making of"" footage included on this video are a nice bonus"
4,The world gone wild,"It's just you now,alone in the endless wastes of the apocolypse,you're wife and son long dead,killed by the motorcycle psycos,but they paid the price or their mistakes,you and the black wraith that is your ride have seen to that,the scream of the last v8 interceptor was the final sound they heard...but that was so long ago...somwhere someone pushed the button and the world vanished in a flash and now you wonder, forever searching for the juice to keep you moble, a broken heart is your only companion,the sadness never leaves and your soal has forgotten how to fly,the days blur in timeless monotony never knowing what dangers await around the next turn,so you drive on because you can't turn back...This is the life of max,the road warrior.It's a great movie,even if you don't normally care for this type of thing check it out it's worth the time."
3,still cut,"when this came out it was uncut and the old vhs was uncut, but for some reason when it was put on dvd it was chopped up to get an R rating and plot and violence was cut from it and this master has been used on every dvd on the planet although there seems to be a japanese version that was the uncut print but dont know if this story is true, so its up to you buy this cut version or wait and find out if a definitive print comes along using an uncut version of the film, who knows with this new movie coming out they may release the full unedited print"
5,An Apocalyptic Cocktail,"An incredible apocalyptic fairy tale, George Miller's THE ROAD WARRIOR paved the road for lesser films that followed this mini blockbuster about an ex-cop named Max daring the wastelands of the Australian outback.The film depicts a world gone mad, where those in power maintain their agression not with money but with gasoline ... the only remaining source of power left on the planet.Wandering into a Hatfields/McCoys fued between the last outpost of humanity and a bunch of leather-clad crazies, Max has to decide whether he'll stand alone ... or he'll stand for a purpose.The film's climax is a frenetic truck chase sequence that will, quite possibly, never be rivalled on film."
3,The Warrior on the ROAD IN BLUE RAY!,"This classic movie looks good! It is not a great transfer which may be because of the original source material 's condition, or the movie company and/or director 's decision on how best to retain the film 's quality. I love this movie and it does come across in Blue Ray as being updated well visually and the audio is rounded out in detail in hearing some slight nuances.I would have liked to have had more in the Special Features (such as a documentary/interviews to view). But, the commentary is really insightful!I recommend this purchase if you don 't own this movie for home viewing!"
5,Second is better than the first movie,"It's a good movie. I liked it a lot more than the first. I remember watching it as kid when I disliked it, found it boring. Many years later I've decided to come back to it. I found it to be good. Interesting story and good time killer."
2,Good Movie No spanish subtitles,"The Road Warrior is a classic, but doesn't have Spanish subtitles on the features. I hate when a good moviecomes without this feature."
4,The Road Warrior on Blu-Ray Great,"the Road Warrior on Blu-ray is great quality due to the great high-def transfer. I won't get into the plot, because I'm sure it's been covered many times over, but to me it is a better movie than Mad Max with cuter women and some nice uncensored bare breasts!"
5,"Can you say ""Peak Oil"" boys and girls?","Hehehe I knew you could;-) Mad Max, when it came out in the states was seen as a post-nuclear war vision. One where the US and Russia wipe each other out, but the rest of the world just faces the economic collapse that the two superpowers war causes. The Australian perspective was more to do with the energy crunch of the Opec embargo, one that hit Australia very hard. Mad Max is more of a 'peak oil' series than a 'post nuclear' series.And we are facing the beginnings of that dark future now. It could be 20 years, it could be tomorrow. Once the fuel prices spike high and stay that way, the panic it will cause will alone be enough to disrupt, possibly destroy civilization.This is a movie that we should put back in theaters. Like the budget theaters that some cities/towns have. People will come for the action and Mel Gibson, then they'll remember the beginning and the end of this movie, the narrative."
5,Best of the Max Trilogy,"This movie is one of my top 5 all time favorites. This is much more than an ""action flick."" Beneath the stunts is a powerful film that transcends the genre. The direction, cinematography and acting are first rate.A classic."
5,Why pontificate? It rocks.,"A gritty low-budget film with violence, fast cars, and a young Mel Gibson. It manages to be a ""cool"" movie while at the same time actually having a little to say about society. A great action movie with some substance to it. Oh, and a title so cool that professional wrestlers named themselves after it. What more could you ask for? It's obviously not the last word in acting or plot, but it has a soul, something few action movies seem to accomplish these days."
3,Needs more special features,"Great movie, fine quality, but not much more than you would have gotten on a VHS tape. Would like to see more bonus content."
5,The Road Warrior,"Technically a sequel to Australian director George Miller's ""Mad Max,"" this gripping, hyperkinetic sci-fi action film not only stands on its own, but actually throttles past its predecessor. Gibson, reprising his role as Max, is all nerve and bone as the rugged, laconic loner, and his visceral performance has star power written all over it. In supporting roles, Emil Minty is touching as Max's feral-child sidekick, while Kjell Nilsson is unforgettably fearsome as tribal leader Humungus. Miller's ""Road Warrior"" is one long adrenaline rush, epitomized in the climactic scene involving a band of crazed villains pursuing an oil tanker at breakneck speed."
5,A movie without wires...,"CG, models, and no emotard actors. No pretty boys -correct that- on the good guy side. And Explosions!!! Gibson, that Jew hating drunk was at his start and it shows in spades, but playing a gruff tired man worked fine for him here.The director used a lame excuse for the settings, but the action and VIOLENCE more then compensates!Blu-ray sadly shows the poor print unfortunately."
2,When will we get to HEAR the ORIGINAL?,"I'm not sure how many people realize that when ""The Road Warrior"" was first released, it was given a DUBBED soundtrack. The Australian accents were deemed too difficult for the average American moviegoer. As far as I know, this is the ONLY version available. It would only be fair for this listing to indicate that Mel Gibson's voice is no where to be heard. (Incidently, the dubbing was done by actors of modest talent.) Now that Mel Gibson is an international star with a highly recognizable speaking voice, and now that Australian movies have been popular in the US for decades, would it be asking too much to have ""The Road Warrior"" remastered with its ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK??!!"
3,The Road Warrior,"The Sequel to Mad Max(A Movie better than this)is a decent flick(if compared to Beyond Thunderdome) it's long and a bit boring at times, I am not a fan of Post-Apocalyptic films.The story isn't good but the action makes up for it along with the chases and vehicles. And While I despise Fords I thought the movie was cool and decent."
5,"The Best, the original!","Ok, ok, i know this wasn't the first film in the series, but as far as I'm concerned its the best and the original that all other post-apoc movies were based on. later!"
4,A great fantastic flick you can watch over and over.,"The Road Warrior is a great movie! It the best Mad Max in the series. With great action and a good story made this movie and Mel Gibson the success he is today. If you like action filled future movies, see ""The Road Warrior""! (If you like this movie you might like- ""The Fifth Element"", ""Mad Max 1 and 3"", ""Waterworld"", and ""12 Monkeys"".)"
5,This movie is Great!!!,One of Mel Gibson's best flicks that made him a superstar....It's a great sci/fi flick that makes you appreciate what you've got and what it would be like if something like a nuclear war ever did happen and no more fuel. One of the best movies made and entertaining from start to the end.
5,Its Mad Max,"I have loved Mad Max since the 80's. Is the acting good? No. Is the story at all believable? No but, hell no. But, its a movie I enjoy watching several times a year and never get bored watching it."
3,Love Mad Max Movies....,"and I had forgotton how dated, sexist, and just plain old this one would now seem. Still, if you're a fan of this series, as I am, you have to watch them in chronological order, or it just isn't the same. An extremely young looking Mel Gibson."
5,One of the classics...,Really enjoyed this movie way back when on VHS. Bought the new version and still really enjoy it. The best of the series with Thunderdome a bit behind and the first one waaay back. Didn't really dig that one. Gibson did such a great job in these movies... too bad he turned into that freaky dude he is now days. I would have loved to seem him as an older Max in the fourth movie.
4,Best movie ever!,"I have always been a fan of the Mad Max series and I was very excited to hear of The Road Warrior on Blu-Ray. Excellent movie and you really see the difference on BR, it only lacked more extra features. But, overall a must buy!"
5,A Very Dated And Laughable Action Movie!,"Sadly this movie has not stood the test of time. It looked okay in 1982 when it was first released but it is unintentionally a funny movie now. In this film we see Mel Gibson as Max ""A Burned Out Shell Of A Man ""(cliche ) who stumbles across a petrol refinery. The editing in this film is a joke and Max 's car gets totalled which all happens in about 3 seconds. You see the car on the road then it flips over about 3 times. This does not even happen to me after too many glasses of Chivas Regal Scotch .The only good reason to watch this film is to see the beautiful ex model turned succesful actress Virginia Hey who went on the much better things in the hit series ""Farscape"" ."
3,Glibson,"Hard to get involved in a non-story with an indifferent lead. It's basically two hours of car crashes and killing with the production designer as star. Fair dinkums, sport. It's looks pretty dapper on the PC while you're strangling a Croc, or whatever kids do nowadays after school. The message is that when society breaks down human beings will do nothing but kill each other. I think that's a vicious slur on humanity. We torture people first and then we kill them. Actually, they do that it in this film, as well. Bang goes the review."
2,Wait for the special edition,"We all know it's a great film, so no need to comment on that. The DVD is terrible. The film and sound quality are barely better than VHS, it is presented in fullscreen format which reduces the brilliance of the cinematography, and there are no decent special features to speak of. If you really feel the urge to see it, rent it, and wait for the special edition which I'm sure will come out eventually. If the MadMax special edition is any indicator, it should be a great SE DVD."
1,One of the worst DVD transfers out there,"Great Movie. 'Nuff Said. Horrible first-generation DVD. The menuing system looks like it was done with the sort of throwaway software they give out with DVD-burners. The audio is horrible - the effects and the music drown out the dialog, so you either have to play it so low you have to watch subtitles for the dialog, or just be blasted by the effects track. Chapter selection for only every 5 chapters too! The picture quality looks like VHS."
3,Letting numbers ONLY tell the story.,"This meticulously-researched book contains maybe 500 pages of extensive statistics and 20 pages (if that) of narrative text. If you're looking for the written history with analysis, anecdotes, exciting moments re-told, or a personal story of the ASL, this book might not be for you. If you are looking for page after page of player names, exact dates, accurate game results, even goalscorers, than this is a no-brainer must for your collection. A typical entry: p 304 NEWARK AMERICANS 1931 (FALL) Nov 27 v Hakoah Away Loss 2-5 goals by Archie Stark and (?) McCombie. Also includes 17 pages of team photos, newsprint articles, and snapshots. I was looking for the story and not the stats, so I give it a 3. It's not very useful for the casually interested fan of the beautiful game"
3,Not bad..,The cool air doesn't go entire space. Only the bottoms of my cosmetics are cool. I wish the temperature could go down. It doesn't go below 55F.
4,Nike Flywheel,I Bought the glasses as a gift for my husband. He is a golfer and says that they are great for the course. They help keep a good visual on the ball and stay tight when he swings.
5,Great Valentine's Day Gift,"I got this as a gift for my fiance` on Valentine's Day. We both enjoyed taking the time to sit down and fill this all out. It really gets you to open up about all sorts of things. I think it will also serve as somewhat of a time capsule, when we wait a few years and look back at what we wrote. It's a great romantic gift to give."
5,Get to know your SO in ways you haven't even thought of yet,"I purchased this as a gift to my husband on the occassion of our 1st wedding anniversary. We've already plowed through about 20 pages of questions- ranging from poinant to funny and every emotion in between. The book even asks you how you feel about answering the questions- quite funny. I enjoyed this book so much that I gave a copy to my sister-in-law and her husband. If you are looking for a way to get to know more about your spouse or significant other, I highly recommend this book. You will learn and be entertained all at the same time!"
3,fun but can cause problems,"I've always loved these books, but once you've been in a relationship for years it starts to cause a few arguments when you get to certain questions.. much easier and relaxing when you first start out just to find out things about each other"
4,be careful,i really liked this book. i mean i bought it with the intention of growing closer with my partner but it can get tricky. alot of differances can come up or like tense situations so just be careful. the shipping was perfect and came on time.
3,Long but Fun!!,"It's stupid, but it's fun to do if you don't take it too seriously. My significant other and I have been dating for six years, and we'll sit outside with a glass of wine by the fire and complete a few pages at a time just for fun!"
2,Warning: This may break up your relationship.,"My partner and I were given this book from a friend and were hoping it would be a fun, lighthearted way to get to know each other more after years of dating. That, it is not. Every other question seems geared to provoke controversy. It makes me wonder if Philip P Keel is a lonely, bitter man sitting back trying to break up all the happy couples out there. I know what it is like to ask the tough questions in relationship, to have in the open truths about what bothers us about each other or what we would like to see more of, but every next question in the book invokes unnecessary argument around mundane details that are inorganically being shared. I can see why this is going .01 right now."
4,A Fun Activity For Couples,"All About Us is a very fun activity for couples, especially if you like to read and/or write. It's a question and answer, fill in the blanks book with every question having two blanks for each member of the couple to fill in. There are questions that you would probably never think to ask and questions you already know the answers to.In addition to being fun to complete, it's a nice little keepsake for the future. My husband and I fill out one of these every couple of years, and then look back and compare answers. Some of our answers are identical from year to year and some are comically different. I'd recommend this book for any couple who is bookish and wants a fun keepsake."
1,There are some things that should be kept private...,"My husband and I have a wonderful relationship and no problem communicating. We were given this book as a ""fun gift"" and at first it seemed harmless enough. However, the more I look at is, but more I think that there are questions in here that delve into areas that can potentially really hurt each others' feelings. Why does my husband need to know the reasons i don't like being in the relationship, or who my last sex dream was about, or what the best thing anyone ever did to me sexually was and who did it? i am all for asking new questions and exploring uncharted territory, but i also think not every single detail of one's life needs to be opened up to questioning."
2,Not what I expected.,"I bought this for our one year anniversary and wish I would have picked something different.I expected a more general and sweet way about telling the ""story of us"" and while there were some questions along those lines midway through it got to more sensitive questions that could be hurtful for each other to hear. It was about that time that my husband and I decided to chuck the book in the garbage because rehashing old flames or picking at each others faults was not something we expected to get out of the book and it wasn't going anywhere pretty."
2,Unpleasant with a partner,"I saw this in Urban Outfitters once and thought it seemed cute. Later when I came across it on Amazon, I purchased it. The beginning was fun but then it went into some intrusive questions that just weren't positive for a relationship. I think I'm fairly open with my partner but I just don't think there's any real benefit to going over some of the uncomfortable questions."
3,Not for married couples.,"While some of it was quite fun, most of it wasn't very helpful/surprising. While my husband and I have only been married about a year and a half, we've been together for 6 years and known each other for much longer than that. I would recommend it for couples in a newer relationship."
3,"Cute, but be careful","This is a very cute idea, but be careful! Some of the questions can cause very hurt feelings."
3,Only for mature couples who have been together for a while,"My boyfriend and I (been together 4 years) are about 1/2 way through the book. There are some questions that give a little insight into what your partner is thinking - be ready for both the positive and the negative!!Also, there were some irrelivant questions such as ""The age of the oldest person you have had sex with and the age of the youngest"" - sorry but I don't need to know that and my boyfriend doesn't care to know who I had sex with before him or how old they were. Get real! So we ended up skipping quite a few questions in the ""Before Us"" chapter. It's worth a try, it's fun and a cool learning experience. Just know that it is all in fun, keep and open mind and it may be smarter to skip certain questions rather than argue or get your feelings hurt over your answers."
5,Really makes you think!,This book really makes you stop and think about your relationship and gets you talking!! I recommend it to any couple!! But be careful! We have gotten into some pretty heated discussions over some of the answers!!
1,Book was bound incorrectly,"I have this book and love it so much that I bought it as a wedding gift. However, the book was bound incorrectly. It started on page 7 and the table of contents were all off, etc. I recommend the book but not when you open it and the first question is: ""what you would change about your partner at this very moment?"""
2,Not very helpful,The book didn't really do anything for us. A lot of the questions were just weird and not particularly helpful with respect to building a relationship and getting to know your partner better. I didn't think it was worth the money.
3,Didn't get very far...,"I saw this book at the store and thought it would be a good idea for my boyfriend and I (2 years)to get to know each other better and communicate better, includung the little stuff. We only got a couple pages in before we had an argument. I plan on using white out on the questions about touchy subjects, especially in the ""Before Us"" section. What does that really have to do with ""all about us""?"
5,A Good Book For Relationships,You and your partner can really get close and get to know each other simply by filling out this book! A must have for any long-term relationship.
1,NOT New as Stated,"I was dismayed to find the book in poor condition. Although it was stated as new in the posting, the covers have marks, dents, worn corners and even a very noticeable pit on the back."
2,Stupid.,Bought this thinking it would be kinda cute... But it is just plain wierd. Some of the questions are stupid some just have nothing to do with us! Also the cover was all scratched up and it just looked plain bad!
3,"Spectacular, but be open-minded","I bought this book to try and open up some lines of communication with my long-term boyfriend who tends to freeze up when talking about serious matters or practices ""selective hearing"" when we talk about our problems. I thought that maybe if it was WRITTEN DOWN he couldn't misconstrue anything. Well, I was right.At the end of the first section of this book it asks both you and your partner if you are willing to accept what this book reveals. If either of you would answer no, don't go through with it. My boyfriend and I got through about nine pages before he said he had to take a break, and we hadn't even gotten to the really serious questions yet.I think that this book asks questions you wouldn't normally ask or have a hard time talking about. They are straight forward and while some of them are just fun, many are very serious and potentially hurtful answers could result from them. Just be prepared. I would definetly recommend it."
4,"All about us, and whatever happened before us...","My boyfriend and I are getting more serious and I bought this book because I thought it would be nice to look back on, and leave out on a coffee table. DO NOT leave this book out. Hide it. There is a section titled ""before us"", I suggest skipping it, who cares anyway? I really like going over this book, It really gets the two of us talking, and yelling, and getting over whatever we got upset about. The funniest question was ""does your pet mean more to you than your partner sometimes"". Buy this book if you are seriously in love, dont bother otherwise, it will fill you with reasons to break up."
2,Unexpected Surprises,"I ordered this book with the intention of making a weekly ritual with my boyfriend where we could sit down, fill out the book together, and reflect on some good memories. I read through the preview provided, and thought that it seemed perfect for us and would incite a lot of laughter. But when I got the book and glanced through it... there really are some sections I could do without. Going through past relationships in great detail is not something that I want to bring up again with my boyfriend, and this book definitely asks you to delve into these previous times. If you don't feel comfortable letting everything loose and don't care to hear about your partner's sex life pre-you, don't buy this book."
2,Not Very Romantic,"I was looking for a sentimental journal to share with my partner. This isn't it. It's more like doing a women's magazine quiz together. That's fine, but it doesn't capture the romance of us. (""Are you disgusted when your partner farts or burps?"" yes/no) I also think it's better for younger couples who may be more eager to write answers to questions about their sex life in a journal. I found some of the questions offensive."
3,it was ok,"i bought invoker and destructor together and their ok, kind of a cross between mickey spillane and buffy. the vampire council gets interesting as the series moves along but nothing new is really said here just some guy fighting vampires. the vampires are ""real"" not undead, but that's been done too, so there weren't any surprieses. the chick is a vampire and a werewolf, whatever. destructor was a lot like anita blake and invoker was like blade, which is why i gave it 3 out of 5. not too original."
5,Absolutely Awesome!,"Okay, let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of Merz's work. I started with The Fixer and then got The invoker when that came out last year. I managed to have a relative send me a copy of The Destructor overseas where I've been serving for the better part of a long time. That far from home, it sure helps to have a great series of books to escape into. And merz delivers once again. Lawson just keeps getting better, the action is great + the overall quality of these books gets better every time. I have reread these books a lot and they are really really cool. I'm not going to go into all the details of the book because other fans have already done that. But if you want a really kick butt series of novels you have gotta pick these things up. Merz is already a star in my book and having slogged through ALOT of action books, that's not an easy thing to accomplish. Great job Jon!"
5,great book,This was a great one. I cannot wait until the next book in October.The characters in the book get better as the series continues. I hope that there is further involvement between Lawson and Talya. Shiva was a good addition to the story. It was interesting on her multiple personality ( do not want to give it away). Wirek is always good for a laugh.
3,You get what you pay for.,"I wanted a cheap emergency sewing kit. And that's exactly what this is. Good enough to fix buttons on shirts, emergency hems and such. Something guys and girls alike should have around the house. I know a lot of guys in the military that keep sewing kits in their cars, in the house and at their girlfriends."
3,An ok item,"Bought this as a secret santa gift. It was just as descrived. The plastic case is a little cheap looking but who cares about looks. This guy needed the materials inside!Do not buy this for a sewing afficionado. If it is for a person who has no clue what a needle looks like, you got the right item."
3,you get what you pay for.,"This little kit has about everything you could need for a quick repair. The storage box that everything comes in is a bit cheesy, but you get what you pay for."
3,sewing kit? More like Button kit,The picture for this product is really misleading. It is TINY! I was looking for a real sewing kit. I had just got a sewing machine. This stuff is not for a sewing machine. It is for the button fixer. It even has button and hook and eye clasps. But this is not for a sewing machine.
2,sewing kit,Not at all what I expected. I thought it would be much bigger. I have one that is bigger and I thought it was the same thing.
1,miniture sewing kit,This was a very disappointing sewing kit. This is one item I would not tell anyone to purchase.
5,Sewing Kit,Customer service was swift and appreciated. This product is an excellent value...and perfect for almost any repairs. Also small enough to travel in its own case.
5,The man would...,"roll over in his grave - forgive the cliche. To think that anyone would ever want to prissy up the crass, hard-boiled writings of Dashiell Hammett by combining them all into one, glossy, spit-polished volume.... If you want to read Hammett the way Hammett is meant to be read, go to a used book store. Find the most beat up, tired copies that you can, and, for effect, tear off the front covers and burn the page edges.But, regardless of your method, read Hammett, read everything by Hammett."
5,"The Best of Hard Boiled,plus a look at some rough lives...","during early Depression America. Each of these five classics shed light on the human condition,corruption, nastiness,and sometimes,redemption, and are as good now as 65-plus years ago. The most famous THE MALTESE FALCON, and THE THIN MAN have been made into several classic films over the years. RED HARVEST seems to have a corrupt town as it's main character,a town called PERSONVILLE, but usually pronounced POISONVILLE. The GLASS KEY is also a classic,if less known film.THE DAIN CURSE rounds out the series. Simply, not to be missed!"
5,I like the books by Dashiell Hammett- have read every one.,"I bought this for my son so he could see the writing style. He is beginning to write, so wanted to expose him to good authors. Guess that is why I like C.L. McDaniel. He writes in the style of Dashiell Hammett.Dr. Dotty Heady"
2,Not the item described,The manual say some functions that the computer dont have. i follow the steps 10 times and i cant see burn calories i cant see temp and others :(
4,GT Speed Demon 10-Function Bicycle Computer,"The product is fine, just don't expect to get one anytime this biking season. I bought this one for my daughter and received it very quickly and was very happy with the product. So, I ordered a second one for my son-in-law. that was on July 18th. It has yet to ship and there is an estimated deliver out to August 29th!! How can an item like this possibly take 6 weeks to deliver?! I will never order from this vendor again."
5,"Not just a few great songs, a great album","It's been a long time since I've had an album that I can listen to all the way through. This isn't just an album with a few good songs, it's an ALBUM.Check out his other album ""Burnin' Ocean"", which is just as good if not better."
5,Romantic tragedy,"This beautifully written book speaks of the naivety of the young mind, enamored with danger and adventure. Always twisting and turning in ways you won't expect. If you are looking for happily ever after this is not your book. If you lack appreciation for dark character based novels this is not your book."
2,Really quite a terrible book,"Rightly rejected by publishers, not once but twice, during the author's lifetime. Even as viewed in time and context, as a formulaic romantic novel, it falls short. The characters are wooden, the dialogue laughable, and the plot increasingly preposterous. Enjoyable only in the light of the author's later oeuvre - if you can imagine Jo, twirling a long false mustache, as she cackles with evil glee as the black-hearted villain, then you've gotten the spirit of the thing."
4,"Great for my husband, not my kid ""yet""","My husband and his buddies are loving this thing. I'm not so good at it, even hard for adults, but hope to see my son grow into it. Black & white screen (color would be better); hate the safety, but I guess it teaches good habit's, ha. Very fun for the adult hunter, with little up-coming hunter."
1,Just bad.,A waste of my money. It was too short and honestly Dolphina can't bellydance. A waste of time and money.
3,Unisex odour?,"I like Fa products because they dont leave white marks on my clothes, but I used to feel more dry when I used Rexona and Nevia a year ago. I dont know wether its the deodorants or the weather as I moved to a warm country.Regarding the odour, this (the green one ) doesn't smell like the other fem. ones, in fact I felt its a men deodorant but a friend of mine thought it could be for both sex."
5,great product,"I grew up using Fa 24h Active Deodorant Aerosol, Caribbean Lemon scent. Then when I moved to the US I got into the whole antiperspirant kind of deodorants. Eventually it started to irritate my skin (the armpit area). I had to go back to Fa, and as soon as I used it all the irritation has gone away. It smells so great and it lasts forever."
1,This product didn't work for me,"I am not a stinky person, really! I never have been prone to deodorant ""breakthrough"" (failure at some point after application) but with the Fa, I would notice it would fail after four to six hours making me smell like a bowl of rotting citrus fruit. (I have been using Mitchum Roll-On Unscented for years and have never had a hint of failure in the usual 24-hours between showers). I also did not care for the way in which this product seems to be over-pressureized, in that, when you spray it, you are quickly engulfed in a cloud of deodorant; Relatively little product gets to and stays where it is supposed to. I tried increasing the application but with no better results. I wanted to like this product but unfortunately it wasn't even marginally acceptable for me to continue use."
5,This book is great for beginning courses.,"Rock Climbing is an excellent resource for beginning courses offered through high school and university programs. The text is full color and includes many exciting photographs by noted climbing photographers and very nice artist renderings of gear and techniques. All the basics for getting started are covered. The text describes techniques and methods for Traditional and Sport Leading as well as for Top-roping routes. Information on specific training for climbing is provided and one chapter even presents a mini-guide to some of the best areas around the world. Of course, I am a bit biased since I wrote the book"
2,Don't judge a book by the cover!,"Okay, okay, I was suckered in by the attractive cover...I was convinced this would be a ""good read."" Was I wrong! The writing was pedestrian and the plot was implausible! As I read, I thought ""I teach high school students who can write better than this!"" The protagonist's goal to go to med school was never believable and characterization was weak. I do not recommend this book...read regencies by Joan Wolf, Mary Balogh, Elizabeth Thornton if you want to read about characters you can care about."
1,Do your homework before you write historicals,If she had sent this novel 40 years later it would have been believable. There were three medical schools for women and at least one in Britain in the 1850s. Implausible and unbelievable with stereotypical characters. Fans of historical novels aren't just fans; they know their time periods and can pick out mistakes very quickly.
2,A tough retrofit,"The feet are well made and solid metal. The fasteners supplied with it will only work if you have inside access to the speaker cabinet. I tried using them (they are hammer in threaded inserts) but they quickly break out if the speaker is moved. As most people dont have inside speaker access, and like me are retrofitting a speaker, you will need to be a bit handy to install these. You will have to buy additional mounting devices that are threaded inserts that screw into holes you have to drill in the bottom of the speaker case. And then since these devices are metric and I could not find matching metric inserts, you will have to tap SAE threads in the feet and buy or make your own threaded shafts buy cutting a head of a bolt."
2,$7.50 For the OEM Wii Sensor Is the better choice,"After My wii sensor died I went to the store to purchase a new one, The wireless one was my only option so thought it may be a little more convienient but I was unfortunatly mistaken, the sensor is certainly operational and works, but not for long, 4X AA batteries may get you 4-5 hours of play I went through a 20 pack of batteries within a month while the wii controllers did just fine with 2X AA batteries, Needless to say it just kept killing my batteries and I use Energizer and duracell with the same results, Finally I just logged in to Nintendo's store and ordered a wired one to save the money and headaches, if you buy this product be prepaired to be purchasing batteries like Gas."
3,Did anyone mention the annoying and blinding blue light?,"I agree with all of the other reviews. It's a great idea and does the job well. It is frustrating to have to turn on the device separately sometimes. I'm not sure how long the batteries last yet and that could change my opinion in the long run, but overall I like the device. Among all the complaints out there, I just wanted to throw one in about the very bright blue LED light on the front that's on to show when the device is on. It really is quite blinding and distracting when playing because it's aimed right at your face. That problem is solved with a little black tape, but it's just another little quirk the device has that makes it a little more annoying. It could have been better, but, like I said, it does the job."
2,Not far reaching enough,I bought it so I could use it in my apartment with my projector and the signal simply didn't reach far enough to make it worth it . It didn't even reach as far as the normal wii bar with any sort of accuracy so I couldn't see a practical use of it.
2,This demon loves to eat batteries,"The wireless sensor is great if your Wii to far from where you need the sensor or you don't like cables (though the cable is so small, I don't see how this would be a problem).The main issues with the Sensor Bar are as follows:1. The bar eats a lot of batteries. My wife and I get a game we bought actually enjoyed together and between the two of us, the fresh batteries died in two days.2. The bar's 'auto-shut off' does not always shut off... leading to further draining more batteries.3. When the bar does auto-shuts off, sometimes it is during play break time which often leads to issues with continuing game play (some games will not ""unfreeze"").4. The bar is just not as accurate as a wired one, especially as the batteries start to fade. Leading you to replace the batteries BEFORE they are dead."
2,Battery runs out to quickly,It has a short battery life and it is a hassle replaceing batterys every other time I use the wii
2,My opinion:,"Okay, i can see how this might work for some people who dont play often , but if you do play alot ,, it is not convenient.It does not eat the battery up, but it is a pain for it to go dead in the middle of a game!!! And as the batteries get lower, you have to be closer to it... Honestly, I really don't like it at all!!!"
3,This is a good product minus,the battery gobbling ability. I feel that this bar has definitely improved our playing ability of the wii with a mounted LCD but the fact that it eats up batteries means you need rechargable batteries on hand to make sure you dont destroy your gaming experience
1,not impressed,bar has a limited range and doesn't work as well as the one that came with the system and plugs in.
1,do not but this thing,like the first guy said this thing does nothing nothing nothing. it cannot communicate with the wii. so if you ran over your wire with the vacuum do not but this to replace your wii sensor bar
1,Worse and Annoying,"Using this wireless sensor since the dinky wire won't reach my new setup. Instantly I have noticed how much WORSE this sensor is. Shaky response forces my to re-position all the time, yet its in the exact same place as the sensor that came with my Wii. Poor choice. I would not buy this again. I wish they made an extension wire so I wouldn't have to hack my own wire...but I am considering it given how crappy this wireless one is."
1,this thing sucks,it beeps for no reason and doesn't work when you are sitting 20 feet away from the tv
3,Wireless For The Wireless Wii,"With the successof the Nintendo Wii, many gamers though have complained about the sensor bar, because it sometimes falls down whenever get a bit too close, and that it is still wired to the Wii. Nyko, which has made some previous lackluster controllers for Nintendo products before has tried it again, with their Wireless Sensor Bar. It is easy to setup and connect with the Wii. Unfortunately, there has been a huge problem with the gameplay. At times, whenever I'm playing a game like The Legend Of Zelda Twilight Princess, my Wii controller stops working, and I have to change the batteries, and it affects the gameplay constantly. To be honest with you, I think Nintendo can make a better wireless sensor bar than this one. In the meantime, stick with the one you got with the Wii.Price: C+Convience: C 1/2-Setup: C+Overall: C"
3,Maybe mine is defective?,"I Purchased this because it was on sale on Amazon for $13.99. I'd stick with the original sensor bar because for some reason, I get a choppy cursor. When I move my Wiimote around, the cursor doesn't move around the screen very smoothly. I don't know why. I'm not giving this a bad review nor can I give it a good review since I might have received a defective one. I don't really know for sure. I'll just pack it up and use it for when I travel. I don't have pets or kids to destroy my wire like many other reviewers said; so I'm content with the original sensor bar."
3,BLUE LIGHT!!!,"The blue light never turns off. How long will it last before the batteries die? but it works nicely, i can now sit on the couch which is farther away then the wired sensor bar reaches."
1,useless sensor bar,Got this for my husband so he could play Wii games during the summer on our three season porch. Worked one month fairly well.....he attempted to change the batteries this afternoon and found the four double AA batts did not fit back into it. He has spent the last 45 minutes trying to figure this out but finally gave up and can only assume something inside must have broken. Pretty shoddy quality if after on battery change the guts fall apart. We won't bother buying another one.
5,Great replacement for oem unit,"No wires for the cat to chew off, and it works like a charm! Kids are happy with it. You just need to make sure that you turn the thing off after use, or your batteries will die. My kids learned that the hard way... they couldn't figure out why the thing was working. Serves them right! :)"
1,eats batteries way too fast,"rechargeable batteries only last about an hour in this, i have to keep spares in the charger at all times & constantly switch them out. this should have at least come with a port for an optional ac adapter to plug into the wall"
1,Do you really need this?,"I did not notice any difference on my 52"" LCD from 6' away. It sucked the life out of my batteries, twice. I must have left it on? The warning sound goes off after one or two hours but when you get playing you forget all about it. The blue LED light on the front is SO bright I had to cover part of it up with electrical tape."
3,It works...but sucks batteries like a Hoover!,"One my kids broke our original Nintendo (wired) sensor bar. We had gotten another wireless bar from an different manufacturer's accessory package but didn't use it. By the time we needed the wireless bar (a few years later), it didn't function.So we decided to buy this item. It worked like it said...but it said nothing about the fact that you'd have to replace the batteries after a moderately long session (2-4 hours). So now we have two sets of 4 AA rechargeable batteries. One in the sensor bar; one recharging. It's inconvenient at a minimum...except it does tell us parents that the kids have played long enough.And as others have pointed out, you could get by with any other light source, suitably placed.I wished we had returned this item as it isn't worth the money, but my husband thinks it is good enough...now that we have enough rechargeable and regular alkaline batteries."
4,Works like a charm.,"It has yet to run out of batteries after a month of play, and in a home theater environment, it gets rid of the blasted wire running across the middle of my living room. The only slightly annoying thing is the loud beeping (sounds like a weak smoke alarm) that occurs if you have it set to shut off after 1 or 2 hours. It would make sense if it beeped a few times as a warning that it's going to shut off, but the thing doesn't shut off by itself before 10 minutes have gone by."
1,does not work!,This sensor does not pick up a good signal. It so bad I threw it out and bought a different brand. Its not worth saving a couple of bucks and it cost me more in the long run!
1,wireless wii sensor bars suck,"NEVER GET A WIRELESS, the battery life is less then 4 hours, and it shuts off every 1 to 2 hours depending on the settings, yeah you can turn it back on but in the middle of a boss battle, or some other important part of the game the last thing you want is for your controller to stop working, the extra range ability is pretty much useless, it doesn't work, unless making the cursor all jittery is working, to be totally honest i wish my original sensor bar was not vacuumed up, yeah the person that did it replaced it for me, but this product sucks, as a matter of fact if anyone wants to trade a wired sensor bar for the wireless one i have i'd be more than happy to do so, i will also include 4 rechargeable batteries with it"
2,"Does the job, but not for long.","Gotta say, I was excited when I saw this product. I ran out and bought it -- set it up and was instantly pleased at the ""plug and play"" nature of the wireless sensor bar.I was VERY upset, however, when my wireless bar was COMPLETELY DEAD after just a few months of use. New batteries and a product reset was ineffective.Hopefully Nintendo will come out with their own wireless sensor bar."
3,it works but...,"It works as it supposed to but, blinking light bothers my eyes.I had to have it though 'cause my cat keeps chewing off wired sensor..."
2,"Good price, but doesn't deliever the range","My living room is quite large and the standard Wii sensor bar leaves the on-screen arrow acting jumping, along with a delayed game response (which is quite aggrevating when playing Mario Kart!) so I purchased this sensor from Wal-Mart today to fix the problem. Unfortunately for me, it did not. After calibrating the remotes with the new sensor in the Wii menu, the jumpiness was reduced minimally and the delay still existed. I measured the location of the sensor bar from where I was sitting and it was almost 25 feet. I moved up a bit and it worked fine (just like the stock sensor). I plan on returning the item tomorrow since it simply did not deliever the distance it markets. If you have a large space, hold onto the recipt incase you encounter the same problem I have.I gave it 2 stars because generally, the stock sensor will work fine. If you really want to go wireless, than the price can justify the purchase."
3,Battery life leaves a bit to be desired,"[...]Rorke Haining's review linked above beat me to the punch. In short, it's a great concept but rather than battery powered it would be better to have an option for a power adapter - either to a USB port, to a plug-in charger, or even to the Wii connector. Battery life is limited to a few days and there is no sleep mode, the only option for power management is a 1 or 2 hour timer that lets loose with screeching before shutting down. Wireless is great if you can set it and forget it for a few months, but I'll probably either modify it such that I can power it externally or buy aNintendo Wii Sensor Bar Extension Cable."
3,Average,"I have to admit, the motion bar does its job, and there is good range, but it is a battery hog and cannot be turned off without taking the batteries out, or letting that annoying alarm set off for five minutes. I barely have enough batteries for my remotes! I recommend it, if you have the money for batteries every day."
2,Battery compartment construction is problematic,"When I first ordered this sensor bar it was dead on arrival. Amazon quickly replaced it. The new one worked flawlessly for four months before the battery compartment started to get loose. Eventually, the batteries wouldn't fit in the compartment right and make proper contact. So, the sensor bar won't power. While the bar will function as advertised, the build quality is disappointing. Hopefully, now that it has been about 6 months since my order Amazon will attempt to resolve the issues."
2,Does the job...,"The blue LED on this bar does not work, right out of the package. It still emits IR and functions, but without the LED, it is easy to forget it is on. The only saving grace is the alarm feature, which you can set to one or two hours. The alarm is the only way to tell if you left it on accidentally. If I were to do it again, I'd just go back to the wired version (and probably will when this dies)."
5,Great Product! Only one thing that sucks about it...,"Some mice chewed through the thin wire of the original sensor bar I had, so I was looking for a replacement. Hadn't planned on going wireless, didn't matter much to me, but found this product at a great low price and figured I'd give it a shot. Turns out it works awesome. Setup is a breeze and I'm still not sure how it speaks with the Wii console...I figured I would have had to plug something into the Wii to transmit the signal wireless, but nope. Put the batteries in it, turn it on and you're good to go.One and only complaint: The blue light on the front of the unit is ridiculously bright. My GF dipped some nail polish on it to cover it, but a tiny piece of tape will also work.Neat feature is there is a timer that'll beep at you at either 1 hour or 2 hours to let you know the sensor bar is still turned on. You can also turn this reminder off completely, if you'd like."
2,shaky 'reception/signal',"I have had this bar since I bought the Wii. It works, but after 10+ ft it gets shaky. It doesn't sense the Wii remote as well making playing certain games, such as Super Mario Galaxy 2, a serious challenge and so frustrating until I realized that the sensor bar is the only plausible cause of this annoyance. I've had to purchase something else. As to whether this one will work out has yet to be seen."
2,Doesn't work for me,"After swapping in the Nyko wireless sensor bar, my Wii cursor becomes choppy and tends to jump all over the screen. It's no help adjusting the remote sensitivity in Wii settings - I couldn't get the two flashing dots at any sensitivity level. I had to swap back the wired Wii sensor bar.Perhaps I've received a defective unit. I've contacted Nyko support by email and has yet to heard back.The two stars I give are for the its good looks and the ease of use. I would have given this a 5 star if only I could get it to work."
2,not worth the hassle,the sensor bar is a great idea letting people that keep their wii away from the tv do so without the problem of the cord showing. unfortunatly the cost will continue to rise for you constantly using batteries. this product uses 4 aa batteries to power itself. the most play i've gotten from it is about 24-36 hours without the need to replace them. there is no warning that you need to replace them only a sever drop in range of the playing area and you have to stand directly in front of it for it to continue to work. overall a great aftermarket add on if you can afford to keep replacing batteries or if your not the hard core gamer. stick with the sensor that came with it.
4,This is a very good product,"This is a very good product, I use it ever i go to my friends house or a hotel, the only problem is: it use 4 bateries AA...."
5,Great buy,"The Wireless Sensor Bar rocks! And no wire for the rabbit to chew through. It works better than the original for me, wider range of motion detection to the sides and up down than the original. The LED arrangement differs from the original, too, which may contribute to it's different pick-up range. I'm very happy with this purchase."
1,further from tv?? hardly lol a lot less,"I bought this thing under the impression that it would let us sit further away. Well after installing and turning this thing on, it's exactly the opposite. We can't even sit on our couch in our tiny apartment which worked great before... The wii remote cursor starts flicking around 5-6 feet from the tv. It's unusable and I feel cheated. Stay away from this product. I'm going to buy a replacement wired one from nintendo."
4,No more cords,"If you have a Wii, like me you probably end up dragging it around and hooking it up to all the places you go. With the wireless bar its just one less cord to hook/unhook and wind up.Performance wise I think the bar has a longer range but not as much width and is not as responsive. Over all it evens out."
1,stopped working after 1 month,"It worked great the first week. Then it got weak. We had to jump around and move and really struggle to get the sensor to sense our controllers. We kept replacing the batteries (we made sure to turn it off after every play) and it would work good for a day or two and then it would not sense again. Now, after a month of use, even when the batteries are replaced and we do flips in front of the TV, it will not sense a thing and I am on-line buying another sensor bar. My recommendation is to not buy this item."
1,Wii Wireless Sensor Bar,"The concept is great but the outcome is not. You have to change batteries way too often, even though it is off it's not.Returned product for the original kind with wire, the kids like it much better."
2,Battery hog,"The range is fantastic but it uses a set of batteries every other day. No, I am not exaggerating!"
3,Good product with issues,"This is a great product, but poor design mars its usability.The 2 issues here are: first, the LED is a bit bright. It distracts be a bit as it is in the field of vision when looking at the tv. (What do you look at when you play?)The second is that the battery cover is on an opposite side of the sensor bar from the ON/OFF button. The problem here is that if it is mounted at the bottom of the TV, you have to make sure to use a new bit of double sided tape each time you change the battery. Not a major issue, but one that could have been avoided with proper design."
4,Good purchase,The reason I bought this was the provided sensor had wires and they were all over the place. It works great although with my big living room a little more range would have been nice. It works well up to about 12ft.
1,Purchase at your own peril ...,"This item worked fine for about two weeks. At least I think it did. I initially only used the wireless sensor bar for EA Sports Active 2, which doesn't require much cursor action. The problems started when I tried to play Metroid Prime Trilogy. The buttons worked, but the cursor was nowhere to be found. Then I tried World of Goo, Bit Trip Beat, and so on, but to no avail.I never thought I would have so much trouble finding a suitable replacement for my original sensor bar. I'll probably go with the refurbished wired one straight from Nintendo. These wireless sensor bars seem to be more trouble than they're worth."
4,It has no cord for cats to eat.,"The little cord on the ""sensor bar"" that comes with the Wii requires one chomp from a cat to render it worthless. The drawbacks to this wireless version are that it requires batteries and that it beeps in an annoying manner when its timer nears the time you have set for it to turn off (to save batteries). I haven't explored the issue thoroughly, but in the several seconds I spent looking it over, I couldn't find a way to turn it off manually once it was on, and thus there is no way to stop that beeping or to turn it off before the timer runs out, other than to open the battery case and dislodge a battery.As others have pointed out, a Wii ""sensor"" is not a sensor; it is two LED IR emitters."
4,working well so far,"my tv hangs from the ceiling, so i didn't want any extra wires dangling all about. this product fit the bill. i've only used it a few times, but it seems to work fine. it's a bit heavy with the batteries inside, so make sure whatever tape/adhesive you use to mount it to the tv is nice and strong. can't comment on power consumption (battery life) yet, since i'm still on the first set of batteries."
1,Stayed on,The sensor bar always stays on. If I turn it off it turns back on by itself a couple hours later. If I don't take out the batteries whenever I'm not using it the batteries run down. Then I have to replace them.
4,Well this one isn't a game...,"But it helps with playing the games. Only caveat, make sure that you set the timer when you get it, as it defaults to no timer and then chews up the battery as a result. The alarm that sounds when the timer has expired is a bit loud, I wish it had volume control.Other than that, it's more sensitive than the bar shipped with the Wii and eliminates the need for the wire that plugs it into the Wii (which only provides power for the LEDs)."
2,does not work!,"I purchased this item and after finally getting the distance and sensitivty adjusted, after couple of days it stopped working."
3,Its Good and Bad....,"You see, the sensor bar has its pros and consProsMakes the whole sensor bar experience easier without the wire connecting it. (My cats always chewed on it)Easy to turn on, just push a buttonConsVery limited battery life, an hour of playing will denote the need for four more batteries which.....Are very hard to put in the bar thing.More than ten feet away makes the wii glove dance and skip around almost all the time, except for when the batteries are fresh, which is only for five minutes or so."
2,no off switch,I bought this as a second sensor bar to take traveling. I didn't want to undo the original sensor bar every time. This thing has one switch and one button. The switch is how long to stay one and the button is to turn it on. So can't keep batteries in while you travel since the button sticks up. Also since you can not turn it off it is annoying. It beeps loudly when the end of the time limit is near. I wish the made just a small LED light blink. So everyone in the adjoining rooms is awakened by its alarm clock beeping. Every hour or so depending on the time setting. Oh finished playing but what is that alarm still going off.
1,Uses batteried like water in the desert,I vacuumed over my son's wired sensor. GameStop only had this one that takes batteries. I am replacing the batteries every other day. Who the heck wants to do that. This thing costs $20. Why would they not add a plug to it. I'm going to find a wired one for my son TODAY!!!
2,"Not awful, but not great either","I used primarily the math section in this book and found it to be very frustrating. Many lessons are not in the proper order, and many lessons are not necessary for passing the GED. I often would be completely confused by the lessons until I went further into the book and found the instructions I had needed ten pages back. This book might work OK for somebody who is studying in a class, but for independent study this book gets a fairly poor review from me."
5,GED BOOK,This book has turned out to be very useful!! It has helped me a lot!!! & I hope some time soon I get my GED!!! & I'll have this book to THANK!!! HUGE BOOK though have a lot more to go!!!!!!!
5,"With ""Sullivans Travels"" and this, how can you lose?","The story of a young man named Woodrow Lafayette Pershing Truesmith (hey, it's Preston Sturges!) who was born on the same day his father died in the Great War and during WWII, he is discharged with hay fever. However, when he encounters some war vets, his ""letters"" are sent home to his mother that he was a battle hero by them, and after the lie, his whole town is after him even convincing him to run for mayor. A winner! This film really made me laugh and feel good! HOW COULD IT HAVE LOST THE 1944 BEST SCREENPLAY OSCAR WHICH IT WAS NOMINATED FOR??? This, along with the masterpiece ""Sullivans Travels"" (1941), shows what a GENIUS Mr. Sturges was. Buy this one and watch it over and over again. And in addition, why am I the first one reviewing this gem?"
5,A Thinking Person's Movie,"Weak Eddie Bracken is mistaken for a war hero by his hometown after the Army rejects him. Directed by Preston Sturges, this film is full of wonderful and biting satire, a thinking person's movie.--Diana Dell, author, ""A Saigon Party: And Other Vietnam War Short Stories."""
2,Not what I expected,"The ball is actually oval and not round making it difficult to do some of the exercises on the video. I'm actually going to order a different balance ball. Also, it took FOREVER to blow it up with the pump that was included."
1,Not a 65cm ball!,"I bought this ball after I tried a Danskin fitness ball that turned out to be oval instead of round. This ball is NOT 65cm! After using the tiny hand pump for 10 minutes I opted for my air compressor pump - I don't know how full you are supposed to make this ball, but I filled it up until very taught, and it's about 1/2 the size of my other Danskin 65cm ball. I'm returning it. Still looking for a good ball..."
3,Fun Co-op game,"The Red Star is a lot of fun to play in co-op. If you like the idea of Final Fight crossed with Gradius, this game might be for you. The best ""budget"" game I have played on the PS2."
4,A cool shooter/brawler hybrid that's great for co-op,"This is a HARD game. If you grew up with punishing NES era games, then you might be able to pass the game without much difficulty, but to those who started gaming in the PS1 era or later, this game will smack you around in the last few levels (I've been stuck on level 15 for a couple of days currently.)Half of the game is fighting grunt type enemies in a brawler fashion, like a combination of the PS2 ""Dark Alliance"" and the Sega Genesis ""Streets of Rage."" A couple of times each level, the brawling is broken up by boss fights, which play like vertical shooters such as ""1942"" meshed with ""Smash TV"", with tons of bullets everywhere.Co-op is where the game really shines. It's a lot more fun when you are free to do fancy moves with a friend covering you, instead of doing the same combos in single player to stay alive."
3,Film Festival Fare,Worthwhile but nothng much new to see here. Conflicted young men coming of age. A nice rainy afternoon of viewing perhaps. But don't cancel a date for this one.
1,not even as a documentary,"I know is a low budget movie , but this is not whorted to pay for or or even to rent it, is poorly acted, slow, poor movie"
4,Good overall if you want to learn...,"This book is great if you really want to learn how to snowboard. In my opinion nothing can take the place of one-on-one or group lessons... but this book is a great compliment to help reinforce what you learn (or figure out) on the slopes.The illustrations are also really really helpful, so you can figure out what should be where and what it all looks like. And wear a helmet!!"
1,Terrible book for anybody who's been snowboarding more than once,"This was terrible. I just started snowboarding this year, and this book felt completely juvenile to me (and I'm not even that good). Seriously, if you've even stepped foot on a mountain or seen somebody else snowboarding, don't bother. This book doesn't teach a thing."
1,Why is this so popular?,A guitar-less progressive power trio does an evening long classical piece. I have no idea why this is so popular. Yuck. Mussorsky is dying over and over in his grave.
3,Fan Favorite,"Certainly not their most essential CD, ""Pictures"" is a fine live album with fantastic ensemble performances. Though the lyrics are not as astounding as the music, and singer Greg Lake is off key at times towards the end of the piece, the ELP fan will love it. Also includes a spirited but slightly out-of-tune version of ""Nutrocker,"" the rock instrumental of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet tune that was covered years earlier by B. Bumble & the Stingers."
4,if only they had removed the cartoons...,"It should have been a perfect historic performance of an early ELP, but the marvel cartoons effects are really out of place... no more words about it. The performance and image are very good and naive: Emerson, in his brand new suit, fighting with the oscillators of his new MOOG synthesizer; the absolutely breathtaking acoustic solo by Lake; and Palmer trying to get into the rhythm on a part of The Great Gates of Kiev. Very nice film, that's why I recommend it.ELP's segment on the film about ISLE OF WIGHT and MASTER FROM THE VAULTS(from french program Superstars in Concert) are a couple of additional DVDs to be a good companion to this one."
4,A reflection of the seventies,I did not wait till this DVD arrived because the concert is all ready available in Holland on DVD. The concert contains good close-ups of all three musicians and especially the interaction between Palmer and Emmerson in the third number (the second “Promenade”) is a joy to watch. Later on the movie reflects the seventies when psychedelic images joins the number “Blues Variation” and hardly leaves till the end of the movie. Although my copy last only 41 minutes I am pretty sure this one will be the same concert. Hopefully the sound quality will improve because sometimes it sounds a little bit distorted when Emmerson creates an ‘overkill’ of sounds. Like all other DVD’s this video start with two sections you can not skip. They annoy me. .... I wonder if people share these thoughts.
3,"really let down, but not by the band","I was surprised to find this in a music store as I didn't know it even existed. After examining the cover to make sure it wasn't one of those 'documentary' DVDs, I paid my money and went home to watch and listen. This DVD is great in that is shows ELP in 1970, before their prime, raw and unpolished. What a treasure! Then, along comes the special effects; the psychedelic colors swirling about, making it impossible to see the band. And it goes on and on and on... These effects block out Emerson's entire piano solo on Take A Pebble, and Palmer's entire drum solo. And it doesn't go away! I don't care what was 'cool' in the 70's; I bought this DVD to see a concert, not cartoon-art. The sound quality is good, but this DVD has been ruined. Now that I've vented, I think I'll go out and buy a couple cans of spray paint and pay a visit to the local archeology museum..."
3,Very disappointing!,"My format of this particular ELP set is in the Laser Disc format. What I want to caution other ELP fans about is that this concert has way too many video effects in it. The first two pieces show ELP the way they should be presented, meaning giving a great concert. However, in the middle of ""Take a Pebble"", somebody decided to add visual effects, like shadowing, white-out, and all sorts of [stuff] to the performance. In other words, half the time, you can't even see ELP! My rating of 3 stars is only because of ELP's performance, which is outstanding, but the special effects really destroys this concert footage. So, if you are expecting to see ELP in great concert footage, bypass this one. However, if you want to just listen to the music, then give it a try."
2,"Was it Lake who said,","""They call us pretentious and pompous - so we are!"" Indeed. One must be quite adventurous to put one's name next to Mussorgsky's, co-authoring his masterpiece acclaimed for more than a century. The good musicianship softens the blow somewhat; not to confuse with good music, it was more of a fashion statement. With regard to the vogue of experimenting with classics, Deep Purple's Concerto for Group and Orchestra was the most honest effort of them all (albeit futile too). While its musical and compositional merits could be debated, the idea behind combining rock with classical (in this case, rather pseudo-classical) music was of much greater ingenuity."
1,Don't buy this,"To take a performance from a great band like ELP and ruin it with crappy special effects is unforgivable.When I watch this I get so mad I want to scream.Royal Albert Hall and Masters from the Vaults are both excellent DVD's and a must for any ELP fan.Don't waste your time on ""Pictures',one of the worst rock movies ever."
2,What A Silly Mess,"Although ELP have their moments and they were the first prog group I got into back in '72, this is not their finest hour. Come on now, adding their own lyrics to a classical piece and ""Blues Variations"". If they wanted to do anything right to begin with, they should have made this a studio album, where the limitations of being a three piece would not get in the way. My opinion of ELP has always been; take side one of Tarkus, most of Trilogy, and throw in ""Lucky Man"" from the debut and you've got a pretty listenable disc. Pictures was a mistake."
1,Mussorgsky would roll over in his grave,"I'm not a huge ELP fan but I do like a lot of their stuff. However this just didn't cut it for me. Mussorgsky's original piece is a work of geniuses, and Ravel's version is good because it just adds power and color but keeps the spirit of the original work. I think it would have been possible to do a decent rock version of Pictures, but this version seems more like a hack job to me. I realize that not all of the original music may have been suitable to a rock format, however several parts that could have been adapted well, were missing. For instance why was Bydlo left out? This would have been a perfect fit. Also ELP's version of the old castle is just about unrecognizable and has none of the feel of the original. Finally I thought the lyrics in the great gate were just distracting, and almost all it's glory was missing. The only good track was Blues variaions which had little to do with Pictures. Maybe this is why it works better."
2,"Umm, well....","Okay, quite curious about progressive rock, and ELP, I picked up this and Tarkus. I had heard of ELP through research on the Italian band Goblin, which I love. I was hoping this would be similar, and from the many reviews I read, I was anticipating something great.Well...I don't know what to say.Okay, I'll start with: I was dissapointed. And I'm sorry I was, but I just wasn't thrilled. I don't really know what about it all I didn't like, I just wasn't thrilled. I mean, everyone made out ELP's music to be ""mind-blowing"" and ""huge,"" but I just sort of felt like it came off sounding sometimes like music to an old Nintendo game. There wasn't much that was huge about it. Sure, some of this was good. The Hut of Baba Yaga was interesting. But most of the album lost my interest. I'm really sorry to say that, too, because I sort of wanted to like ELP. But I was let down."
3,Rock and Roll Your Eyes,"For those too young to remember, based on the descriptions in the other reviews it's obvious that this DVD is built from the Midnight Movie perennial from the early '70s, ""Rock and Roll Your Eyes,"" which I've seen at least three times but not since the early '80s."
1,Buyers Beware !!!,"First the positive. John Brown's commentary on First Peter is a classic and should be a part of every Christian's library if they are serious about studying the bible. For the commentary in and of itself, I give a 5-star review.Why the negative? Because the ad as given is only for half of the commentary set!! Brown's commentary was originally published in three volumes. Sovereign Grace Publishers re-published this in a two volume set (volume one containing the original volume 1 and half of volume 2, and volume two containing the original volume's rest of volume 2 and volume 3). Therefore when purchasing this book, you are only getting half of the full original commentary set! That's a pretty hefty price for half a commentary."
2,100 million dollar bomb,"Top Gun-2001-HAL2000 clone.2 stars for the special effects,0 stars for plot storyline.Basic tired Hollywood cookie cutter action teen film."
1,Ranks up there with the worst action movies.,"This movie had some good potental in the opening, after that, it looses all grip on everything, the plot of the movie is based on a new JSF style creation fighter FA-37, and a new VTO&L; controlled artificially by a ""AI"", one thing leads to another the ""AI"" goes haywire during a lighting storm, it starts acting on it's own to destroy ""threats"" one thing leads to another their in Tajikistan setting off dirty nuclear weapons, north korea, russia for absoulutly no reason breaking numerus international laws, at one point in the movie, the star of the movie ""falon 1"" helps destroy intercepting fighters with the ""AI"" whois hes ment to track down breaking a bunch of laws himself, and is treated like a hero at the end.It's a backwards movie, don't watch it, please don't."
1,Waste of time,"This movie is just plain stupid.There are so many inaccuracies it would take way to long to cover them all. Suffice it to say, this movie is completely bogus. Even the plot is super thin and hard to believe.Don't waste your time."
3,STEALTH WAS ONLY GOOD I WANTED IT TO BE GREAT!!!!!!,"Stealth was not a bad movie,but i wanted more out of it!!!!! Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx and Josh Lucas do a good job,but their characters could have done better!!!!! It was hard to really have a story,but it was too predictable!!!!! A good movie to watch one time and that is it!!!!!"
4,Good movie.,Good movie lots of action and the visual effect and sound effects are very good story line was lacking a liitle.
