2,Not a Router Table!,Turns too slowly at 12.500 to produce clean cuts with small bits. Probably underpowered as a real shaper. Its NOT a Router/ or a Shaper! Its not a good buy.
2,Delta router/shaper model 43-505,"I too wish I had read the reviews about this machine before I bought. Like most all of the reviews I have now read,I agree with them all. Lousy fence,height adjustment and sharp ribbed top. I guess you get what you pay for ; but don't buy this one. I expected more from Delta."
4,A Great Tool to have in your personal Workshop!,"I really like the Delta 43-505 Router/Shaper. While not as good as some higher end router tables, it does what it is supposed to do. I personally do not have a large workshop with high-end professional equipment, but this router/shaper table is a great addition to my quaint little woodworking shop. I gave it 4 stars because of the price and the features it has and the fact that I have had no problems with this table at all."
2,Ninja won't fit,"Why do manufacturers create toys that DO NOT WORK well. . . like this turtle, who is supposed to ride the motorcycle, yet, fitting him on the seat, and trying to get his hands to grasp the handles and his feet to stay on the foot racks is almost impossible. The one good thing I will say is that the cycle at least will stand up by itself. I have this complaint about many of the turtles. . . and their trucks, etc. Their feet don't stay on the little holders so it gets quite frustrating for the kid."
5,PIANO KEYBOARD MUSIC THAT REALLY RELAXES YOU!,"This Unique set of keyboard compositions really relaxes both body and mind! I gave this CD to a friend of mine at work. She played it for her hyperactive kid who never seemed to be able to concentrate on his homework. Almost immediately, the child became relaxed and had no difficulty in finishing his homework assignment. I personally play the CD in my car to and from work. This gets me relaxed before work in spite of the busy freeway. By the time I get home my nervous system is calmed down to where I can enjoy my family and spend a relaxed evening at home. Great therapy!"
3,"Long, dry, but useful","Reading this text was like pulling teeth--a skilled editor could omit 80-100 pages with no detrimental impact to the reader (i.e., prose is overly verbose and concepts are explained too thoroughly). The writing was very dry. I'd appreciate a more concise edition filled with examples, tables, diagrams, etc., written in a less prescriptive tone. The authors ignore real-world applications of their model by professionals in the field (e.g., the ""descriptive"" side of ID).BUT, this is learning material straight from the horse's mouth, so I can't really complain. I haven't had many opportunities to read original source material from major contributors in my field, except maybe from within a historical context. You will learn the Dick and Carey (and Carey) model inside and out, guaranteed. I liked the scoring rubrics and case study examples at the end of each chapter. I barely looked at the case study in the appendix."
2,Disappointed,I definetly expected more from this textbook. I read it and didnt find a feel to continue reading it further.
2,WAY to esoteric and non useful limited examples,I am currenly takeing Graduate level course in ISD at Roosevelt University in Chicago and this book is very hard to take and use in a work setting I am not looking to write a PHD thesis so I am not happy with this book. I currently work as a Training Specialist and I would not use D&C model in my workplace as it would take to long.
1,Systematic Design of Instruction 7th edition,"This is a required text for my Master's Ed Tech program. I find the book very difficult to read. The writers tend to make statements after statements leaving very little room for absorption; very dense. The authors may be good ISD designers, but in my opinion, very poor writers of their craft. I would not recommend this book."
5,Delicious fun!,"The recipes are mostly unfussy, visually appealing, and Southern to the bone---the photos are lush, and the local storytellers whose voices animate the sidebars are wonderful!"
4,Spanish Class DVD,"This DVD is interesting and shows travel through Mexican towns. It presents history without forcing it on the students. I like the part about the grasshoppers and mole from Puebla - a dish made of chocolate and peppers. The chocolate segments are enticing. The filming is well done. The host is quite comical and gives a light hearted presentation of what appears to a great deal of fun. Great for a Spanish Class, although you need to view to see if all of the parts are age appropriate for your group."
5,good,"I love Dana Cuff.This book was an amazing read, and informed me greatly in preparation for my SCI_Arc thesis in 2007. Thanks!"
1,Empty and shallow,"The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic. The production is utterly unoriginal and soulless. This is teeny bopper product at its worst, and that there are still people who want to hear here is a sad commentary on how crass, cynical, and thoroughly manipulative marketing still pays off."
5,All Partridge Family Albums are great.,This was one of my favorites. Upbeat pop music. Took me back to my youth and many good memories. I recommend it!
4,"very cheap quality,,,,,,, but works.","I've been using these for about 10 years now, and they work very well.Good for about 2 years.Be careful opening food chamber as the plastic tabs are made very cheaply and will break if you bend to far.Again,, it is made as about cheap as you can make a product but, it will rotate twice a day for about 2 years, and only on about 3 battery changes."
2,unreliable,"it's hard to tell if it's working, so i sometimes feed the fish. of course, this negates the purpose of the automatic feeder. i would not recommend it."
4,A New Approach to Handling Complex Ideas,"At first sight this book appears to be at an elementary level, but as one begins to read throught the text it becomes clear that the author has done a remarkable job of conveying some very complex material in a way thouroughly digestible regardless of the readers background or discipline. Covering new applications of measurement science in Biotechnology makes for a curious mix but 'Approaches to Physical Measurments in Biotechnology ' does it in an eminently effective way. A MUST for people in both disciplines - if only to see how it should be done."
3,It's OK. You get what you pay for.,"Precision sliding tables run up in the area of $1200. Don't expect the same performance with this one. It's not bad. It's not ""great"" either.I've had this slider for about 2 years now. It's works fine, and does what it's supposed to do - But it's a somewhat of a PITA to set, and keep square. The flip-stop is worthless. Removing the miter fence (and pivot point bolt) is a pain when you need to rip sheet material.You will spend hours setting it up the first time. No argument there. But the real aggravation is keeping it square! I have to re-tune mine every 1-2 months.FYI: This sliding table is EXACTLY the SAME as the one Grizzly sells for it's right-tilt (1023S) cabinet saws! The ONLY difference is the paint color and logo. http://www.grizzly.com/products/G4227"
4,"Intelligent, clear, helpful","The book first appeared over 30 years ago (and the author died in 1991) but it is still a clear, economical, and patient examination of a wildly difficult field. It lacks the flamboyance of some other works and there are nits to pick, but its aim is to be helpful, not startling, and as such it should be welcomed as a supplement by relative beginners and other curious souls. Though dated (how can it not be?) it is even-toned and not at all dull."
2,beware reading this if you are not a historian!,"Okay. If you're a historian, you might enjoy this book. If you're not, beware! This book is so incredibly dry and flavorless. I was astounded, I mean, how can you make a book about the Renaissance BORING? I guess it's possible. Wilcox gives you a lot of information and it's organized very nicely, but still, this book has no soul. It's just......dull."
5,long live the salsoul orchestra,"Now this is one hell of an album.If disco and dancing was ever your thing, then this compiliation is absolutly mandatoryIt seems like every song is a N.Y club scene classic. The only thing missing was the disco ball!"
5,Good Old Memories,"I was a kid growing up in New York City when Salsoul was on the scene in the 1970's. Listening to the Salsoul sound brings back so many great memories. Washington D.C. Is not really into the House music scene like New York and New Jersey.Again, Thanks for the Memories!!!"
2,Mediocre first effort,"Where are the spectacular views and deep colors? Slow minor key music does not help any either.This is a DVD-R and would not play on my older Toshiba DVD player. It did play on a newer Sanyo unit.There are some truly nice scenes in this video, but unfortunately a lot of filler also. No helicopter shots, and much of the film was shot after the peak color. My guess is that they waited for the nice, blue sky autumn day that can be few and far between in the Smokies. Also needs lakes and waterfalls to add variety."
5,Fuzzbubble Rocks!,"These cats have got one tight act happening. Power, excellent musicians and high productions values."
4,Inspiration,"I loved this short story collection. His portrayal of 1920s and 30s New York is inviting, raw, interesting, and a hits home to all the universal qualities of life and the way we perceive the world. The stories are a treasure trove of feelings, not narrated, but shown by the actions, interactions, and lack of both portrayed in the very believable characters."
3,not enough information,"It has some holes in it... Disney does not have a 1-800 number for priority seating, so you need as much information as possible before calling. This book did not tell how far in advance you can make reservations (6o or 120 days, I have found) It doesn't say how old the kids need to be for all the rides, only some of them. There was a ""Jake rating"" that was great, but there wasn't one for everything talked about in the book. All the restaurants listed did not have a rating other than prices. So I couldn't tell if they were all good, all the same, or some better than others. Same for hotels. I think you could get more out of a different guide book."
3,Girlschool - self-titled (Communique),"I give it 3 1/2 stars.Unless I miss my guess,this CD isn't a 'Live' disc.It's actually a self-titled 14-track compilation of some of the heavier tunes of the long-running heavy metal all-girl band's career,that of course began during the NWOBHM era.Some of the tunes that hold pleasant memories for myself are ""Hit And Run"",""Action"",""C'mon Let's Go"",""Demolition Boys"" and ""Take It All The Way"".Line-up:Kim McAuliffe-vocals&rhythm guitar,Denise Dufort-drums,Chris Bonacci-lead guitar and Jackie Carrera-bass.Believe this disc was later reissue on the Griffin Music label."
4,Nikon Prostaff,I am very happy with the Nikon Prostaff Scope but I think my next Scope will be the Nikon Omega BDC
2,domed feeder,THE FEEDER NEEDS A LARGER DOME TO KEEP SQUIRRELS FROM GETTING TO THE SEEDS. OTHERWSE I LIKE THE TRAY CONCEPT.
5,One of the best accessories for your Unisaw,"If you own Unisaw, or any other large heavy machine for that matter, you really should consider getting a mobile base. Delta's bases are strong, sturdy, look good and are very stable. When I upgraded to a Unisaw, I also bought the mobile base. My Unisaw actually is easier to move around than my contractors saw used to be. With a quick step on the foot lever it effortly raises onto the large swivel wheel and the Unisaw can be moved very easily. A quick flip of your foot to raise the lever and lower the saw and it rests solidly on 4 points, making it very stable. This design of mobile base make large heavy machines very easy to move around and manouver. If your workshop is smaller than you wished it was, put your machines on one of these bases and you'll find your machines take up less space and your shop will seem larger."
5,The perfect base for my Grizzly cabinet saw,This base fits my Grizzly cabinet saw perfectly. Great quality as it moves this 650 pound saw with ease. Much better than the universal bases offered elsewhere (including Grizzly).
5,"""A Heavy Welded Mobile-Base""",Great product from Delta - I have several of these and they haven't let me down. They fit exactly and it makes a difference over the universal base. Easy to move and adjust.
4,"Great ideas and pictures, with how-to's and plant index!","Overall I got a lot of ideas from looking at the pictures. The only drawback was that the captions didn't always list all plants used in the photo, making it difficult to recreate things exactly. But I did get inspired and planted 7 containers yesterday! A list of container-friendly plants in the back was very helpful, but could have been enhanced with a small photo of each so you'd know for sure if ""Helictotrichon Sempervirens"" is what you're looking for. The projects were interesting & I will attempt at least two next summer, but I wish there had been more. Probably because I'm new to gardening. I appreciated the inspiration from this book's photos."
3,"Doesn't fit all 3/4"" by 3/8"" miter grooves!","You need to use some other criteria to make sure this miter gauge will fit your table besides the manufacturer's claim that ""it fits all tables with 3/4"" by 3/8"" miter grooves"". For instance, if you measure the Delta TS200 Shopmaster 10"" Portable Bench Saw's grooves, they look to be 3/4"" by 3/8""-- however, the 34-779 Miter Gauge does NOT fit this table. My guess is, it fits higher end tables (especially Delta) with these groove measurements. The TS200 is their lowest end table and is probably not made in the same factory as their higher quality saws.The gauge itself looks great-- it is all metal and the markings and adjustments look and feel high quality. Just make sure it fits first!"
1,Warning: This Book is EXTREMELY Biased,"This book is INCREDIBLY biased. It's basically an excuse to bash the Republicans and all conservatives in general. It does not portray events and facts fairly. For example, when the Democratic Congress or President failed to accomplish, they are called well-intentioned but constrained by political pressures. If the Republicans fail to accomplish, they are labeled actively anti-environmental and ""secretly"" taking advantage of their power to purposely harm the environment. The policies and concepts are well-explained, but the rampant bias makes the book much less credible. It's really hard to take seriously."
5,best of three..,All the reviews I've read are so complex. It comes down to this is the best of the three. Best plot. Darkest. Acting superb. Case closed..
4,A GOOD SEQUAL TO THE FIRST,"I liked this one. It had more action in the first and it portrayed Darth Vadar as a bigger villain than it did in the first. I saw the one with the added in effects and they were incredible. The truth also comes out about who Luke's real father is, and that's the best part. It didn't end on a positive note, but that makes you want to see the finale!"
2,It's an okay movie but did NOT live up to my expectations.,After the first (technacly 4th)movie I thought this would be much better. The only thing preventing this from getting 1 star is the opening 35min. on Hoth and Han getting frozen. You could take out the entire middle of the movie. The scenes with The Empire chasing the Falcon seemed to drag on and on and on and on and on... The Yoda scenes where better but not by much. This is purely poking fun at the plot the acting was good and the special effects are awesome but it was just boring.
3,The Empire Strikes Back was a fare Star Wars Episode.,"THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK: This movie had three things in calmagn with the first, same characters, same ships, same music. The three things that were different were the special effects, the plot, and there was no battle in space. This Star Wars Episode I thought was a fare movie. I think it was alright. Don't take your word from me. See it for your self, you Judge. I give this movie three stars."
2,Buy the VHS,"I now own 5 versions of this film, and this is the first time I truely felt like I wasted my money. Each version I had previously purchased had been a clear upgrade in quality from past versions, and I was so excited to see the original theatrical versions (as they should be seen)finally available on DVD. Sadly, the picture and sound quality on this is worse than my VHS versions from the 80s. This set is a total rip off and George should be ashamed of himself."
1,"Please screw up Willow, Radioland Murders or Howard the Duck NOT THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Are you freggin insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This ""bonus disc"" is a sad example of how screwed up Lucas has become. The original Star Wars movies are not even worth a new transfer to DVD? It's non-anamorpic to boot. I suggest you skip this release and look for a bootleg, which is pretty much what this is. Hey Luke, you didn't get any money from me for the 2004 box set and you are not getting it now. BOOM"
1,BUYER BEWARE - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!,This is a complete garbage hack job to try and milk more money out of fans.
1,...And I thought they smelled bad on the outside!,"There is no point re-hashing what many others have said before. No-one wants to buy this set for the 2004 edtions (surely there is no-one out there who wants that who didn't buy it already?) No, the attention here is on the so-called ""bonus"" features included with the set. These are not the films you're looking for!Vote with your wallets and do not buy this edition. It does not contain the ""theatrical version"" of the film. It is a 1993 Laserdisc transfer which contains many changes from the theatrical releases. It also contains a version which falls far below the standard consumers would expect from a dvd release in 2006."
1,BOOOOOO!!!!!,Jeers for LucasFilm and their sneaky marketing greed! King George makes Bill Gates look like a patron saint. Nice to see you alienating the people that built your empire on the eve of its 30th anniversary. Way to go George!
1,Why you should just buy the Trilogy,"If Star Wars fans go ahead and buy these individual DVD's of Star Wars:IV-VI, which include the Laserdisc transfer versions of the original theatrical releases, they'll be sending the message to Mr. Lucas that fans don't care about the quality of the presentation of these films. Lucasfilm includes a THX demo on DVD's of their movies to help perfect how the movie is viewed, supposedly because they are committed to quality. Yet with these original theatrical releases, they've been created using the 1993 Laserdisc transfer! Boycott these inferior releases and wait for Lucasfilm to offer us a high-quality, THX certified, product."
3,"Inferior release of the original, but still very watchable","The ""Special Edition"" of Empire Stikes Back looks great in this release. The original theatrical release included on the ""bonus disk"" is perfectly watchable but sadly it did not get the treatment it deserved. I have the 1993 remastered edition on VHS that was marketed as ""The original trilogy one last time, (LOL!) and this DVD does look better than my old VHS. To sum up: 5 star movie, minus one star for the sub par release of the original and minus another star for making me buy the ""Special Edition"" to get it."
3,Simple business decision,"OK it's simple. Lucas has better digital restored masters of the original unaltered versions. If he had released a perfect version now, you wouldn't buy another one later. Get it?"
1,Raping the original format...,"I understand that the original trilogy was not on par with Lucas' vision, but does that mean he has to ruin what they DID become to so many people?It's fine that he's redone and patched up some of the sloppy FX and sounds from the originals...but why has he denied us the originals on DVD, untouched and glorious?Empire Strikes Back is my favorite of all the movies, but I cannot truly enjoy them with the newly added material. It's the same thing with a song.Take a song. It becomes a hit. Remix that song. Is it still a hit?Blah. I'm just so very disappointed with all this. I WANT EPISODES 4,5,& 6, UNTOUCHED OR MOLESTED, ON DVDGeorge Lucas could've been nice about it and given us both formats. I say we begin a petition."
1,"You're throwin' away a fortune here, don't be a fool","The only reason a fan is tempted to buy these dvds in the first place is for the ""bonus"" discs, so the original theatrical versions are the ones to which I am referring. I made a big mistake yesterday when I dropped sixty plus on what I suspected might be trash. Video quality is horrible. Gritty and grainy with horizontal lines in places, vertical in others. Don't be like me and jump at the chance to get these. Let them rot on the shelves. I was a believer that these couldn't possibly be as bad as everyone said. Now I must admit that I was wrong. I have no complaints about the sound, but the picture made me wake up with a headache which still lingers even as I write this. Save your hard-earned cash and join the crusade to get these done right."
5,the best film of the greatest sci-fi series ever.,"the empire stikes back is one of those rare films that are actually better than the first. although some fans of the original may find this flim not as fun as the first and find some of the middle of the film (luke and yoda on degaboh...han,leia,etc. hiding from vader in the asteroid)a sleeper, the total content of the film overcomes this. the story is awsome with plot twists and turns, and the introduction of new characters to the star wars universe as well as the in-depth development and growth of the originals adds to this great story.ivan kershner's ominous dark tone adds a psychological beauty to this film and is probobly the most intelligent of the star wars films. i guarentee this will be one of the best films you'll see so if you haven't i highly recommend picking it up."
1,lucas screws us again.,"After the incredibly long wait for the original theatrical versions of the original Star Wars Triliogy to be released on dvd, we now find out that the original trilogy will not be remastered OR 16x9 enhanced! It is fairly obvious at this point that George Lucas doesn't care about anything else but money. The lengths that George Lucas will go to to make another buck are endless, and he'll screw every fan that he has to in the process. I personally hope he burns in hell."
5,A reason that its the highest grossing film!,"This is the highest grossing film of the Star Wars, and it has a good reason!When it starts, it is a more darker and sober entry, when the droids are dropped, and the attack of the snow monster. The Best part I would say was the battle at Hoth. I was kind of bored during the part of Yoda and stuff, but with Han Solo and the rest, I had a blast!The last battle is amazing as well, and how could Luke survive with his hand cut off!!!!!!! I know it's just a movie, and it is great, although not my favourite, it deserves to be the highest grossing film."
4,Star War vs. Star Fox vs. Mobile Suit Gundam,"but the resale of Star War in 1976-1977, Star War is Sci-Fi Saga, but in Japan Star Wars never make the inside dom, other like none, but Mobile Suit Gundam resale in Japan, in 1979, by that Mobile Suit Gundam and Astro Boy are never been the same, but Mobile Suit Gundam Just like Astro Boy The Same, Star Fox war resale 1993, Star Fox vs. Star War are Real Mortal Enemy, but This All the time of the Sci-Fi Saga, in the late 1929-1937, Star War vs. Star Fox vs. Mobile Suit Gundam are Mortal Enemy of the Sci-Fi Series."
1,Not worth another dip,"If Lucasfilm had actually taken the time to restore the theatrical prints or at least anamorphically enhance them, this would be a no-brainer purchase for me. But they didn't, and by not doing so they lost their chance to shut up the millions of fans who have been clamouring for the original versions for years, not to mention all the Lucas bashers.Personally, I've always found the ESB special edition to have the least disruptive edits. I like the enhanced Cloud City, the redone Emperor scene fits continuity, and the added Wampa shots are over before you even begin to care about them. So the 2004 dvd will be fine for me in this case, and will remain my only dvd copy of the film until the theatrical cuts are properly presented."
1,cash grab,"as great as the 1980 ESB is as a film, it is not receiving a decent digital transfer for dvd. please folks, save your money and go buy the new restored cut of superman II."
1,Original Version NOT Enhanced for 16x9,"Sorry, but that's the deal breaker for me. I only wanted this set because it would have the ORIGINAL film on DVD. But this release of the original will not be enhanced for widescreen TVs. Bad decision by LucasFilm, and I can't support this type of half-hearted release of the originals on DVD."
4,FROM A VENEZUELAN STAR WARS FAN,"Despite the critics in fan forums, magazines and web sites, the original vesion is an aceptable copy of the movie in digital format.If you have an advance equipment and look for a top quality probably you'll get disapointed, but if mantain the integrity of the original moviesis your priority, this is the bestcopy that you coud find. The 2.0 sound is not the best but is not bad.Latin American Costumers WARNNIG: this vesion does not have spanish subtitles and the spanish track is spain/eurepe version. May the force be with you always."
1,Limited Edition means FORVER ?,"How many of the buyers of this item purhcased it due to the misleading indication of LIMITED EDITION? It has now been more than four years since it came out and it is still here and still selling new. The only exception is the price is much lower. I guess the rule is, if you are King Lucas and you wish to shaft the public while lining your pockets, you must manufacture a billion units of a sub-par disc and label it LIMITED EDITION. What is the difference, if you are going to produce crap you might as well lie about it also."
2,Don't bother,"I hate George Lucas. The original version is 4:3 with black bars, not 16:9 anamorphic. What a rip-off."
1,Not up to industry standards,"When these new DVDs were announced, I was excited that I would be able to get Star Wars as it was originally shown in theaters, even if I was forced to buy another copy of the 2004 versions. Just days later I was crushed to find out that these DVDs will not anamorphic and will be using the same transfer as the old 1993 Laser Disk versions.With George Lucas such a big advocate of high quality video this was a major disappointment. This DVD will have horrible picture quality, and I ask everyone not to buy these DVDs until Lucas puts out high quality versions of the original trilogy!"
2,No thanks,"If you want the original Cinema release, without subsequent digital 'enhancements' do not buy this DVD.The original version is in 2.35:1 letter box (which is fine as that was the original cinema aspect ratio) within a 4:3 picture frame (why???). This means that you not only get letter boxing top and bottom but also right and left. So if you've still got an old 4:3 ratio TV this will be OK (and thats all), but for those of us with widescreen TV's this means you either have to watch a tiny 4:3 image or use your TV's zoom facility to get the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio. However if you do this you are reducing quality, and as many other reviewers have pointed out this isn't the greatest transfer anyway.If you're happy with the digitally enhanced anamorphic version then go ahead and buy. However, if like me you want the original untouched movie as released at the cinema forget it. Happily I haven't spent a penny to find this out!"
5,One of the Greatest Sequels ever made!,"Empire Strikes Back is without a doubt the best of the 3 classic Star Wars movies, packed with lots of new great characters and locations, and its loaded to the brim with action and breathtaking visuals! And John Williams' fabulous score only adds on to this classic movie! Empire Strikes Back is a movie that will be around for generations to come, and they'll all enjoy it just as much as the others!"
5,Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back,This movie is awesome. Luke I Am Your Father is one of the greatest movie quotes ever made. star wars has really revolutionized the movie industry. the empire strikes back is awesome. heck star wars in general is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
5,Theatrical version= Better movie experience,"To those who have been complaining about the quality of the theatrical version of this movie, you must have been blinded from watching the altered trilogy too many times because the quality of the DVD release is just fine and there is nothing wrong with it (or at least it looked just fine to me). Although I am a 90s child and did not see Star Wars back in 1980, I thought it was a MUCH better experience than when I watched the altered 1997 VHS tape. Though The Empire Strikes Back is the least altered film, I believe that it should not have even been touched at all, seeing as Irvin Kershner directed it, not Lucas. I must say, simply amazing. For those who wish to see what the 1980 audience saw in the movie theaters, your search is over!!!!! May The Force Be With You.."
2,Not Full Screen as Advertised,"Neither disc (the enhanced nor the original version), fills the screen so it's not a full screen version as advertised. I suppose it can be considered wide screen except it's not vertical, rather it's horizontal meaning the blank spaces are not on the top and bottom of the TV screen rather they are on the left and right sides of the video which I find distracting, as I'm watching a box in a box. I'd only expect this if I were watching an old TV episode on DVD like ""I love Lucy"", not on a sci-fi video that is supposed to be ""enhanced.""The video itself on the enhanced disc is very clear but then again I watched it on a 1080p TV, and a blu-ray player, so the video may not look as good on analog or 720 TV, and regular DVD player.Since it's not really full screen I don't think it's worth buying brand new. At least there I lucked out because I purchased a used copy."
5,THE GREATEST POPCORN MOVIE EVER.,"George Lucas calls the Star Wars films ""popcorn movies"". If that is so then The Empire Strikes Back is the grandaddy of them all. Great visuals. Great characters. Great story. This is a film where everyone(the writers, actors, director, producer, composer, set designers...) did their job to the best of their ability to make a damn near perfect movie. Watch the original version though. The Special Edition contains blasphemy.Now if only Lucas would release a DVD version..."
1,The Originals are BETTER !!!!,"I have bought my 34' WIDESCREEN TV for watching my favorite movies and one of them are the Star Wars films. Once I watched the Special Editions, I did not like the changes. I felt very uncomfortable watching the stupid new dance at Jaba's palace, Boba Fetts new voice, Greedo shooting first, and especially that unfamiliar face at the end of 'Return of the Jedi'. Lucas, release the original films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 surround sound! Trust me, if you do this favor to the fanbase of SW this will make you even more richer! Isn't that what you really want?!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"If you are mainly buying this release for the original versions, please be aware that they do not use the full resolution of the dvd format. They are merely copies of the Laser Discs from the early 1990's, and are not ""enhanced for widescreen TV's"". Buyer beware!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Disc 1 - 2004 ""Enhanced"" DVD ReleaseAudio Is Dolby Digital EX With Optional CommentaryDisc 2 - Original 1977 Theatrical Widescreen ReleaseAudio Is Dolby Digital 2.0Video Transfer Source Is From The Non-Anamorphic Laserdisc Transfer Master To The 1993 ""Star Wars Trilogy"" Definitive Edition Box SetThis description says it all, two discs, one you probably already own and one made from ""cutting edge"" video technology from 1993. If you are mainly buying this release for the original versions, please be aware that they do not use the full resolution of the dvd format. They are merely copies of the Laser Discs from the early 1990's. I wish I could give this release less than one star."
4,TO BAD WE ALL KNOW THE ENDING,"Its to bad everyone knows the ending to this film, which is more serious and action packed than the fun popcorn first film. This whole cat and mouse film wraps up to an astonishing conclusion, when Darth Vader reveals ""what really happened to Lukes father"" We all know the drill, but thats to bad, since thats one of the coolest surprise endings i've seen."
1,Skip this one..!,All I can say is Skip this one.!Disc 1 is the same as the one in de box set. So no added value there.And disc 2 is not even enhanced for 16:9 tv. So if you have de original Laser Disc box set with the 9 CAV discs you will not find any added value here.So save hour money and wait for the re-re-re-re-re-release on HD-DVD.
1,It's been said a hundred times...,"...but I'll say it again. I tire of hearing the hogwash of original negatives being destroyed and it would cost too much money to restore the original, etc. With the exception of the scenes that were modified and/or replaced, how hard would it be to take 90% of the footage and then spend the money on the 10% that you messed with? Hmmm, Mr. Lucas? HMMMMM????For films that have grossed nearly $600-$700 million EACH, I would think that you could cough up a $1 million or $2 to give what we, the consumers, are demanding.I don't wish to hear any more reviewers calling us out as ""whiners."" Yes, it's George's film. But it's OUR decision whether to buy it or not.Count me as one person who will not buy it.PS - George, have you taken the continuity error out of your Special Edition Empire Strikes Back yet? I'm referring to the fact that tauntaun is still screaming AFTER we see the Wampa creature obviously eating a dead animal."
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE,"The movie that made the trilogy grow up....Beautiful cinematography, Visual effects, sound, music, story, acting....NEED I SAY MORE....A technical and story achievement...One of the, if not, greatest motion pictures ever madeI would give it 10 stars/5 stars if I could"
3,"Terrible, if you have a dvd player this is absolutely useless","I was given this as a gift, and unfortunately the person who gave this to me knew I liked The Empire Strikes Back, but failed to realize we live in an age of DVDs. So if you are thinking about buying this, you should just pony up the money to get a DVD player and a DVD copy of this film."
4,"great film, but description of Amazon it's wrong","as all we already know, Star Wars is great a classic one and is a requirement to have this film in our collection.Important: The description that Amazon indicates of the subtitles it's wrong, the Spanish language subtitles not are, only in english."
4,"Fine, but should have been the THX Edition","This is fine, but it should have been the remastered THX edition of the Classic Original that was released on VHS tape years ago before the Special Editions come out. I am not saying a VHS to DVD transfer but the restored masters that they created the VHS tapes with should have been used."
5,One of the best movies ever made.,"Empire Strikes Back is one of those movies that not only excites, electrifies, but it also chills you to the bone with the beautiful and ever-changing surroundings, feelings and emotions of the characters. This is one of the few movies that manages to achieve the highest level of prestiege and respect it deserves because it is not cheesy in the slightest way. But with all respect to Lawrence Kasdan, i must also say the star wars movies, but ESPECIALLY ESB would'nt be as good without John Williams very beautiful and ethereal musical score. You'll feel like you're not even in the damned theatre if you watch this movie in a dark room. This particular Star wars installment will truly take you into its massively never-ending universe for one hell of a ride that no Sci-Fi movie has managed to achieve before or since. I've loved this movie for 25 years and to put it mildly, it is still a great thrill to watch it."
1,GIVE US A BREAK GEORGE!!!,"-STOP MILKING US FOR MONEY!!!I hope all of us boycott money hungry George Lucas by not buying any of his products for at least a year or two. I know I will.When is the American public going to get wise to this scam of ripping us off by coming out with three or four versions or variations of the same movie on DVD. The way George Lucas is going, we will probably see four or five more versions of Star Wars movies before he finally comes out with the Star Wars movies on HD DVD or Blue Ray DVD format. Then we will probably see another seven or eight versions in the High Definition DVD format not including five or six different box sets.ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF THIS TYPE OF SCAM TO GET OUR MONEY!!!"
1,"Lucas owes me $368,587.82 plus interest","I added up all the money I spent on action figures, Legos, props, games, models, CDs, DVDs, video tapes, laserdiscs, cassettes, vinyl, box office tickets, lightsabers, comic books, magazines, cards, coins, posters, cups, glasses, ornaments, tooth brushes, hats, T-shirts, underoos, and assorted miscellaneous swag that I have purchased since 1977. I will be sending Lucas a bill for the settlement to be paid in full plus all accrued interest. I'm sure that's chump change compared to his billions but I want a refund because of damaged goods."
5,The Empire Strikes Back on DVD!,"I'll skip the plot synopsis. It's a pleasure owning the original version of this great flick on DVD. Looks super-duper on my 11-year-old, 31"" RCA ColorTrack II set.Keep grooving crazy Star Wars people :^b"
1,Sucking the marrow from the bones of our childhood...,"Han Solo shot first.The force is a mystical state, not a blood cell.Leave well enough alone, create something new for a change Mr. Lucas instead of rehashing/repackaging the same old stuff. The prequel movies were awful, the only thing worth mentioning was the Clone Wars cartoon. The original classics should have remained that way instead of having their corpses constantly harassed by a child-king and his meddlesome ways. The legacy that was Star Wars is dead to me, finally throwing a bone such as this is only an insult. The irony is that George Lucas is the worst thing that ever happened to Star Wars."
1,An apology from George Lucas,"Greetings fellow fans,First, I would like to apologize for the miscommunication regarding the inclusion of the original theatrical films on these DVDs. Seems somebody at LucasFilm jumped the gun and decided to release these as bonus material. I want to assure you that I had NO INTENTION WHATSOEVER to make these versions publicly available again. Honest. Also, I would like to apologize for the Special Editions but see, my ex-wife Marcia was taking me to the cleaners so I had to make some changes for legal reasons so I wouldn't have to divvy up half the Ranch just to get her off my back. That is the reason why I will never let the original films out of the vault again. I swear.Oh, one other thing, I have just built a new complex for ILM at the Presidio and I just got the bill and it seems I'm a little short on cash so if you could all be so kind and buy these cheapo DVDs for me just one more time, I'd really appreciate it!MTFBWY!"
1,Bait and Switch!,"Lucasfilm is marketing this trilogy release on the inclusion of the unaltered versions of the films when in fact this is a shoddy laserdisc transfer on a bonus disc and the buyer is forced to purchase, yet again, the 2004 versions also. This is essentially retail fraud given that Lucasfilm holds itself as a bastion of home video quality and film preservation - these transfers are 13 years old, non-anamorphic and substandard. YOU WILL BE PAYING $[...] FOR OLD LASERDISCS TRANSFERRED TO DVD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. You will not be able to watch them on a widescreen TV with adequate quality - this is shameful and shameless marketing taking advantage of buyers. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Stay away from this release.,"Save your money for something decent. These 1977 films appear to be what fans wanted all along but are tainted, old, non-anamorphic releases. Stay away. Stay far away."
1,Non-Anamorphic = no sale,"I will not be buying this. I want the original trilogy re-mastered for DVD in anamorphic widescreen, not some lame laser-disc transfer I can get from elsewhere. This is a cheap shot, IMO, on the part of Lucasfilm and not what the fans want."
4,HAPPY BUT NOT HAPPY,I am VERY happy to finally get these. The quality is NOT that great but it is good enough for me. I am just happy to finally be able to see the movies the way they were meant to be seen before the THE EVIL LORD DARTH LUCAS and his EVIL GALACTIC EMPIRE corrupted them.What I am not happy about is that we have to spend major dollars to get the corrupted versions AGAIN! They should've released these for no more than 10 ea. or in a box set w/ just the pure untouched originals. I also know that DARTH LUCAS's EVIL GALACTIC EMPIRE will release these again w/ all the deleted scenes and in better quality but for now I am enjoying these movies the way it was meant to be seen. I feel very satisfied w/ them.
1,Ancient Video Transfer = NO SALE!,"The original versions being offered on a ""bonus"" disc is insulting. These will be non-enhanced for 16x9 Televisions and come from a 13 year old video transfer. This is like the stone-age! So much has advanced since that time. It's also insulting for people who have already purchased the special editions in 2004/2005 to be asked to re-buy them at a higher cost to receive these ""bonus"" discs of a classic film in a less than pristine form. LFL needs at a minimum make a new transfer or the original trilogy. Release this on dvd and then later on hd dvd or blu ray. If that it done, I don't have a problem with buying them again. Give these classics the respect they deserve! Until then I am done with Star Wars. See websites like digitalbits and hometheaterforum for more information."
1,Incomplete even for beginners,"This book is a compilation of many many songs, written only as a single line melody. It would be useful to simply become familiar with the position of the buttons, but that's all(nothing about which fingers to use, etc.). It was a real waste of money for me-----better to pick out melodies you know (""by ear""), but if you're unfamiliar with written music, I suppose you could learn a little about that."
3,Cut Six Betrays the Album's Faults,"Maybe it's the generational difference, but ""Thug N U Thug N Me"" shows why this duo will never ascend to the ranks of classy acts. This crass selection, which doesn't benefit from the T-Pac rap, is a blemish on an otherwise fairly decent R & B release. Its inclusion must be to cater to the ""homies,"" but it is offensive to men and women who relish in the intimacy of a true and loving relationship as opposed to just, as Austin Powers may call it, ""a shag."""
3,I expected much more...,K-ci & Jojo had 2 great all time hits...all my life and tell me it's real...after hearing crazy on the radio..i asked for it for my christmas present I was pretty disappointed when i heard the whole cd because i only liked 2 songs on it! (thug n u thug n me and crazy) i should've just bought the save the last dance soundtrack :( at that time this cd only worthed 1 star in my scale but after listening to it a coupla more times it kinda grew on me...so yea i give it a 3! i ewas expecting waaaaaaay more of it tho!!!
3,Why Don't I Like this?. . .,"I bought X the day it came out and I have not enjoyed it that much. I give it 3 stars because of the vocals. There just isn't one memorable song on the record. Nothing stands out, nothing makes you remember how it goes. Their first two records were fantastic, must haves, but X, X is just. . . its just there."
2,Formula R&B,they always show a Soulful Promise but yet get caught up in Formula Production&Styles.if I Hadn't heard these Guys Show me something long ago i'd just consider them a flash in the pan.because much of the Material here they can do in there sleep.nothing Ground-Breaking or Original.in all honesty it's time for Jodeci to come back fast.it's time to come correct.
5,Best singer ever :),"well, i heard 1 song by her in ohio over the summer ...... i fell in lvoe with her music and i reccomend it to all techno lovers.... dance lovers etc. this girls got talent :)"
3,A bit short,"I personally like their 2nd album (Little Things) more but this one was listenable. Forever in Love and Mystery of Tomorrow were my favorites. Angel on My Shoulder starts out different with a jazzy sounding instrument, In Your Eyes and Secrets are ballads while Edge of Life is an R&B tempoed song. Bonus Videos of the Hit singles Turn the Tide: The video has a guy in a hospital and his heart stops but they get it to beat again. At the end of the video she trips over the cord that was keeping him alive. Last, Forever in Love: A video filmed in warm weather where Silvy is riding a bike down the street near a beach and Wout van Dessel is walking down the side of the road. They are supposed to have a 3rd album out by summer 2004 so I give this album 3 stars."
5,5 Shining Stars for SYLVER!!!!!,"This is Sylver's DEBUT album and what an awesome album it is! I swear to you all that every track is a potential radio single and club smash! This is totally worth the import price! You get 10 slamming dance/trance tracks, PLUS you get 2 hidden remixes if you fast forward past track 10. The two hidden remixes are remixes of ""Turn The Tide"" and ""Skin""!! One of the best tracks on this album is ""The Smile Has Left Your Eyes"". If you like ""Turn The Tide"" then check that one out! If you like DJ Encore featuring Engelina, Fragma, La Luna, Alice Deejay and Ian Van Dahl, you will absolutely fall in love with SYLVER! Get the import now, as it doesn't seem like this will EVER arrive in the states!!"
2,False advertising in the product description...,"The second paragraph under product description:::The silver-metal Swiss Army Knife housing that stores the audio player offers a knife blade, a combination nail file and screw driver, a scissors, a retractable ballpoint pen, a LED mini light, and a key ring.::The file doesnt have a screwdriver tip, there is no ballpoint pen, and no LED mini light. And no key ring.It's still a really cool product, but I REALLY don't like being lied to, particularly about something so expensive. An LED light , screwdriver, and pen were all features I really wanted and contributed to my buying the product."
3,Requires good eyesight,"I can't comment on the performance of this item, as I've never used it. I plugged it into my USB2 port to charged it, and, when I looked at the display, I found that I - with my less-than-20-20-vision - couldn't read it.I suppose it should have occurred to me that something which fits inside a pocket knife might have a rather small display, but I was carried away by the coolness of the toy,Just something to consider."
3,Not quite there yet,"There is plenty of excellent material to read here. The substance is good, but the form is bad. Major areas of concern:a. While there is an overall theme to the book, I got lost moving from one chapter to another. Each chapter, while not written in a vacuum, seems to be disjointed from the preceding chapter.b. Each chapter should have contained some concluding remarks to emphasize the major points with a bridge to the next chapter, rather than leaving the conclusion for the end of the book. The conclusion at the end of the book had some good points, but was not well written. The author seemed to be in a hurry to finish the book.c. The author seemed to be all over the place at times.d. The chapter headings and quotes at the beginning of the chapters did not seem to make a lot of sense.e. Was not able to grasp fully the author's ultimate objective"
5,A survey of how science addresses issues of group identity,"Us And Them: Understanding Your Tribal Mind isn't the New Age title it sounds to be: it's a survey of how science addresses issues of group identity, using new findings from anthropology to neuroscience to discuss the 'tribal sense' and how it manifests in human affairs. Us And Them defines this sense in both a scientific and cultural perspective, from how those from different cultural roots gain reputations for performance and group reactions to how a sense of place in society affects health, cultural manipulation, and more. A 'must' for any who would understanding group psychology, social and cultural influence, and more."
5,Communication in Medical Care: Interaction between Primary Care,Excellent! Communication in Medical Care: Interaction between Primary Care Communication in Medical Care: Interaction between Primary Care Communication in Medical Care: Interaction between Primary Care...
5,Muppets From Space- the best,"Funky and tight, this recording will definently please fans of bands like Tower of Power such. A must have."
2,simplistic yet confusing,I adopted this text for use in a course I taught. I won't be using this book again. I feel guilty that my students had to pay good $ for it.
3,Superman with Batman and Robin -- briefly,"I really enjoyed the episodes, and I'm glad to have them. The album notes are well done and informative, and even the commercials for the free buttons in PeP cereal were kind of fun.If only it was an album of Superman With Batman & Robin, as it claims to be. Oh, they show up, and actually take part in the first story. It has 2 1/2 stories, with B&R as minor characters in one of them.Go ahead and buy it -- for Superman. You'll even get one story with Batman and Robin as a bonus. But don't buy it for the World's Finest heroes."
3,A walk into a Mexican Wedding.,"This book took me on a journey into a Mexican Wedding. Maya, the flower girl walks you through her family's wedding and the interesting things that went on that that day through her point of view. The illustrations by Stephanie Garcia are given in a clay form; I personally didn't care for them. The book has some Spanish words but you don't have to worry if you can't read it because Gary Soto did an awesome job of having their definitions in the front of the book. This is a good book to read during Hispanic Heritage month to learn Spanish words and little about the Mexican culture as well. It does make a reference to beer that did catch me off guard. I personally don't believe the reference of beer needed to be included in the book but, that is my opinion. Overall, it's an OK book that won the Pura Belpré which is an award given for books that represent Latino traditions and cultures in a positive way."
3,Works Well,"Purchased the HTC brand. Same design, almost same price.Legs are effective for what they are intended for. Over priced for 60 plus inches of tubular steels, some angle iron, paint and adjustable feet. Probabaly took 10 - 15 min. to manufacture and paint."
4,Very nice addition to my rigid saw,"I added this to my rigid table saw so I could get that 48"" cut. I thought it was pretty easy to put on. I added melanine to each side to give me a larger surface. I think it sets up just fine for anyone with the skill level to use it. At the time that I ordered this, it was the cheapest place to buy these types of extension legs."
3,interesting toy,This was okay for our 5 year-old daughter. She knew the alphabet and had fun playing with it. She liked it more for the magnetic capabilities than the ability to spell out words. It was interesting that airport security scrutinized this very closely when we traveled with it.
5,Great learning for kids and fun for adults too,"My 9 year old nephew loves this game, it has helped his spelling skills and he has fun with it because of the magnetic wheels."
4,Great place to put bugs after vacuuming them up,My daughter likes to put the bugs she has vacuumed up into this bug habitat. She's only 3 and it helps her get over her bug squeamishness.
4,Great CD,"This has all the songs you would expect from the Ozark Mountain Daredevils, If your into retro music and are replacing your vinal then this is a good cd to have."
4,An excellent Ozark mountain daredevils cd,OMD a great country rock band who created several great albums.This compilation features 21 of the finest songs from them.This band is very similar to southern rock groups like The Outlaws and Molly hatchet.This compilation is good and is highly recommended.
3,Jackie Blue is the Best Song Ever!,"I love the song ""Jackie Blue"" I was a little kid when the song came out. The CD covers their classic work, and has very good digital remastering. Since I'm not old enough to know that much about the band, this CD was a good one to start with."
2,Where is Jackie Blue?,Whiskey Tango Foxtrot - best of and no 'Jackie Blue' ??? really? 8 more words required 8 more words required
2,"Not the ""Very"" best of the OMD","Everything the Ozark Mountain Daredevils put out deserves a 5 star rating in my book, but this greatest hits compilation doesn't have what I would call the ""Very"" best of the band and it falls a little short. No ""Beauty in the River""? No ""River to the Sun""? No ""Fly Away Home""? No ""Snowbound""? If you only have space for one Ozark Mountain Daredevils album on your shelf then I suppose this will fill the need, but I'd say just skip this compilation and get all their albums instead. You'll feel much better in the long run!"
4,Ozarks missing 2 songs.,"There are two songs from the Daredevils that haven't been on any CD or other compilation.They are ""If I Only Knew"" and ""Fools Gold"".""If I Only Knew"" was around 1976 and ""Fools Gold"" around 1980.Both these songs are favorites along with the other many OMD tunes.Has anyone ever heard of these two or know of any CD's they are on? I have the 45 of ""If I Only Knew"" and the LP of ""Fools Gold"""
2,Gets a little better if you can stand to keep listening,"Jason? Are you in there? We don't need another Justin Timberlake, ok? I understand that people need to experiment, but please stop this silliness. The best cut is Plane - the WORST - O. Lover (it embarrasses me, and I had nothing to do with it). All the other songs are passable, with some great moments and some purely awful moments (the oft mentioned opera bit). I think I'll stick with the old album. He sounds like a whole other guy on most of this one, and that's sad."
3,Jason Mraz,"Isn't this a strange piece of work? To say Jason Mraz is a little quirky is saying alot. I enjoyed one or two, the rest were...different.I need to give a shout out to ""Big Star Books & Music"" for the 5 Star rating they deserve for following up and ""Making it right"" for me. I would order other CD's from ""Big Star Books & Music""...maybe another Jason Mraz, we'll see."
4,Fun CD!,"I bought this CD for a road trip from Texas to Arizona. It was a fun, upbeat CD that helped me not fall asleep. Jason Mraz has such talent!!"
1,Where's the Mraz I know?,"To say the least, I was let down my Jason's new album. I was so excited for this release because I love his music (especially his live stuff) but Mr. A-Z was a total disappointment. You definitely can't tell how good of a guitarist he really is. It just seems like he sold out on this one. Jason, go back to your Java Joe roots. And I'd like a refund please."
3,new listener,"well im a new listener to jason mraz and i dunt really kare about him or hnis cds, just want to hear teh music. this cd is pretyt great if you don't mind a few bad tracks of half of it bad. some goods are wordplay, geek in teh pink, did u get mah message, clcokwatching, plane, please dont tell her and teh forecast. they take awhile to grow on you ""kinda reminds me of utada : but his songs are great. they do sound like the 70s so my japanesey act won't do good here but his cds are good for anyone hoo wants to hear 70's sound without 70's real music. id say guitar fans would like this music for sum inspiration, overall great cd."
1,Overproduced,"Mraz makes his attempt to hit the masses with a more mature album than the previous. Ultimately it fails on all levels. No longer do you get the feeling that its the Trio (i.e., Jason, Toca, and Ian) in the coffee house. I wouldnt have minded if it was like the debut album with the unmistakable Mraz style with a bigger band in the back. However, this album is unmistakably bad. Do yourself a favor...if you have the first album, skip this one and try to find some of his live stuff. Mraz has some on his website. Word to the wise. Any live concerts prior to 2004 are money. Everything afterwards...blah."
3,Eh.......,"i was really looking forward to this cd.......and i must give it credit for being a lot different than his debut, but it's just plain not as good. first of all, ""wordplay"" is just a terrible terrible song. any song that acknowleges itself as the ""single"" immediately loses any credibility it had before it made the declaration. but some of the standout tracks are ""life is wonderful"" ""o lover"" and ""geek in the pink"" but if you don't have ""waiting for my rocket to come"" get that instead."
1,A complete and utter waste of time.,"After looking forward to this album for months - it's now heading straight for the used CD store. Lillywhite, how could you have produced this tripe? My respect for both Mraz and Lillywhite are now lost..."
1,Moans,"Trying to ride the coattails of a trailblazer like john Mayer, this 2nd rate knockoff comes up real short."
1,stupid,"i listened to some samples of this cd on itunes an boy! i can tell ya... i found the lyrics stupid, silly, obnoxious, and immature,i'm not trying to presuade you into staying away from this cd, go ahead and buy it...it'll sound like a 5-year-old sung and wrote it.other talentless artistsashlee simpsonhilary dufflindsay lohanravenlinkin park"
1,AWFUL,What is that opera attempt? In comparison to his other cds this just shows how his talent is based on the people who produce him.poor.
1,horrible service - beware!,Seller claims there is a problem with Amazon - some sort of financial dispute. My card was debited immediately upon sale but they claim Amazon didn't pay them. Claim this has happened with many customers and hence have stopped sending items sold until the dispute is resolved with Amazon. Niiiiiiice!
3,"good songs, weak album","Waiting for My Rocket to Come is probably in my top 10 favorite albums. It has a clear musical identity, one that can't exactly be placed in a single category. But its consistent. Mr. A-Z lacks consistency. Mraz dabbles in genres and he pulls most of them off, but as an album it is incomplete. Most of the songs lack depth and the sincerity of his first. It's enjoyable to listen to and I like a lot of the songs on their own, but I don't think this is the album of musical genius hyped up in these other reviews. If you enjoy his debut and want more Mraz, I suggest his live albums or just see a live show."
3,Buy it - but dont listen,"I have to admit, I am bad about buying CDs to do my little part in helping out an artist I think is worth it. Jason Mraz is certainly worth all the support he gets.Unfortunately the heavy-handed (why oh why!!!???)producing by Steve Lillywhite completely ruins what could have been a great CD - leaving it to be one that I will only listen to maybe 2 songs from.Point: Mr. Curiosity could be a really fabulous song - but then this warbly voiced opera woman starts - WTF???!!!!????!!! Way to ruin a great song, Mr Producer.Like everyone says - keep listening to WFMRTC and the live stuff - just let this one sit on your shelf."
3,What the!!!,"I was asked to listen and review this cd as a part an assignment. Surprisingly I thought the cd was nice, it had a good mix and was relaxing to drive too. I dont usually go outside of R&B/Hip Hop but, this just let me know that I can be insprired by all genres of music if I ever wanted to write a song. This cd could be gold but he will have to promote it heavily."
2,What went horribly awry,"The exalted producer in to ""save the day"" screwed the pooch. I have rarely heard such an overproduced album. O. Lover is especially eggregious. The opera singer is really a nauseating addition. What's especially tragic is that you can usually hear a good song underneath all the excessive polish and pomp. Mraz's first album was a pop masterpiece, even with the justified criticisms of the juvenile humor. This one has been butchered. We can all mourn the loss of the buried songwriting and await the next album. Let's all hope it's got someone other than Lillywhite at the helm."
4,A Great Effort from Mraz,"On this Sophomore studio effort Jason Mraz shows fans that he is not only a talented recording artist, but a true wordsmith as well. Songs such as ""Plane"" really work to expose Mraz's capacity for writing incredibly creative, yet touchingly emotional compositions. ""Song for a friend"" is another example of Mraz's more serious side, and really hits home as an uplifting tribute. ""Geek in Pink"" and ""Wordplay"" seem to be an extension of his more upbeat, slightly goofy, yet captivating efforts on Waiting for My Rocket. Overall I would highly recomend this effort by Mraz, and can't wait to hear what he has in store for the future."
4,Mr A-Z surprises,"Jason Mraz has a beautiful voice. He sings not only lyrics but you can hear the individual notes. His music is new, full of beat. I sometimes hear parts of Queen and ELO back in his songs. This is a compliment. I play it in the car a lot and it makes me feel good."
2,Disappointing,I Was anxious to buy this CD but after I listened to the songs I was disgusted. I expected way better. To many of the songs sounded alike and the songs were just BORING and SLOW.If you like fast rock music this IS NOT the CD to buy.I hope that IF anohter song Is released it will de one of the songs from 2-4 (big selection..huh).
3,Seems like the rocket didn't hit the target,"I really enjoyed Waiting for My Rocket to Come, the songs were livelier and catchy. This one sounds very run-of-the-mill. He just drones on the words. Where did the liveliness go?!!Hard to accept but...he even sounds like god-awful Click5 in some of the songs."
2,"Just like DMBs recent release, this album is crap",Jason Mraz is a good singer and he happens to play some guitar. He is not however a John Mayer. John Mayer creates memorable songs and he can back it up with his guitar. Mraz's first album had the memorable songs eventhough he's nowhere close to mayer in guitar department. This album has about 2 good songs which means this album is left with no memorable songs and obviously not much guitar to back it up. Mraz should've kept it like the first album. If it ain't broke don't fix it with s@#$.
5,"Great Album, Lots of Fun","Jason has come through with a great album. As a big fan of all of Mraz' music, I cringed while giving his latest studio album a run through, expecting a typical studio production usually lacking in the style and substance that he produces while live on stage. Instead, the album provides a lot of fun songs, well placed together on the album that has given me ample driving music. The beats and rythyms are good, the lyrics thoughtful, and the all around sound is great. It'll be knocked by published music reviewers who wont appreciate the sound or the fact that the music puts you in a great mood and provides a worthy soundtrack to my everyday life."
5,AWESOME!,"This is one of the best CDs I own. I'm a huge Jason Mraz fan and this is the best CD he has. I think you have to be a pretty big fan of him to like it. It's a little like ""Waiting for My Rocket to Come"" but not very much. ""Wordplay"" and ""Geek in Pink"" do sound like his first CD but, as far as the rest, not so much. If you're looking for a pop CD, this isn't it. I think he put more emotion in this one and it's more personal."
3,It takes a crane to build a crane???,"Borrow this album from a friend. It's not worth buying. There are some goods songs on it, but it's mostly album fill. Which is surprising given the amount of time since his last album."
2,Not that great,"Wordplay is really the only song from this CD that stuck with me, and it's the single. Mr. A-Z fails compared to Jason's first. All in all- a mediocre sophomore disk. To be honest, I was dissappointed, Waiting for My Rocket to come was/ is great, and I will always love it- but Mr. A-Z is def. not up to par with what I love and expect from Mraz."
4,Good Pop Music,"In the midst of most of the commercial junk out there, a few stars shine for normal people who want to listen just some good decent pop music. This cd fits the bill. Just buy it. P.S. Am I crazy or does Mraz sound like Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees?"
3,Mr. A-Z is just alright,"I wish Mr. A-Z would stay away from overly produced albums, they just aren't very good. I'm a huge fan of Jason's LIVE stuff. I think I've played the silver off the LIVE CD of his. I wasn't too fond of Waiting for My Rocket to Come, and now this Mr. A-Z, because it just sounds so different and produced, it doesn't capture the real way Jason has with words.Anyhoo, it took a couple listens to Mr. A-Z for me to come around to it a little, however ""Life is Wonderful"" makes me want to gouge my eyes out! Obviously this is one person's opinion, take it or leave it. But believe me, buy his Live album and you'll see the difference and what I'm talking about."
3,hmmm,"I've been a huge Jason Mraz fan since before his debut. I love every single track on Waiting For My Rocket To Come and Tonight, Not Again is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I was psyched for Mr. A-Z to come out, but when it did, I was a little bit dissapointed. Granted, I've DEFINITELY warmed up to this album a bit, but I feel like it wasn't done as well as his old stuff.Regardless, it's definitely worth buying if you're a fan, or if you're more into the pop than the singer-songwriter scene. My favorite tracks are Wordplay, Bella Luna, Plane, and Please Don't Tell Her. Ha but I always skip over Geek In The Pink...it kind of reminds me of N'sync.Anyways, best of luck to Jason (i'm seeing him live on sunday!), and best of luck to you guys, hopefully you'll enjoy this album."
4,Mr A-Z,This CD is a lot of fun. Several songs that are great a couple that are just so so. I would recommend it
5,Absolutely love this album!,"You know a CD is going to be great when the opening line is ""It takes a crane to build a crane.""Jason Mraz is a lyrical genius and his music is great! I could recommend this to anybody."
2,Sophomore disappointment,"I see there are a lot of huge Mraz fans out there. I am still too but am I the only one who thought the first album rocked me out but this second one knocked me out (zzzzz)? The first CD was one of those rare ""front to back"" CDs where pretty much every song was awesome. Sure this second one has its diamonds in the rough (like Wordplay, Geek in Pink, & Did You Get my Message) but everything else?? Advice? Buy the first album & download the above songs. You won't be disappointed. Because this sophomore album made me want to ""Sleep All Day..."""
2,Lucky to get 2 stars,"As a Jason Mraz fan, I was extremely disappointed with this album. He dazzled us with his first release and then was followed that up with an amazing live album which was better than his studio work. This latest album was weak. He got cocky. Tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 were good and tracks 8 and 12 were amazing. It is a decent pop cd but it but shows no signs of the independent brilliance that he once had."
2,GREAT FEATURES BUT POOR QUALITY,"Pros: Cheap, looks nice, flat screen, good picture, TV/DVD/VCRCons: Ridiculous. DVD player never worked, and VCR just broke!We got this for our kid's room. Unfortunately, we should have just bought a regular 20"" TV, regular VCR, and regular DVD player. Would have been just as much $, and I could have just taken back the individual components when they break, instead of lugging a heavy 20"" TV as well.The DVD player has worked for a total of about 3 DVDs since buying it 6 months ago. It basically does not have a DVD player. And the VCR just died. It plays the sound, but the picture is all static. I cleaned the heads and it didn't change a thing.Now the DVD/VCR functionality of the thing is GONE, and it is simply a TV.I will NEVER buy Sylvania again. I advise you to (not) do the same."
3,Trouble at first,I went to Best Buy and bought one of these units and when I arrived at home with it and went to set it up the DVD tray would not come out of the slot so I couldn't use the DVD portion of it. Needless to say I returned it and it was replaced with a new one. It is used as a bedroom unit so not too much expected of it except to produce a picture when we want to watch movies and it is more than adequate for that. If you want an inexpensive all in one unit this one will do the job nicely.
2,Manning deserves more,This book is slim and very old so it doesn't have too much to offer. It's a mixed bag of activities and doesn't go into much depth on any.
3,Just OK,The red sugar is quite washed out compared to other red sugars we've had - and mixed with the white sugar makes it appear even more washed out.
1,Op-Center Fans AVOID THIS BOOK!,"I am a fan of the Op-Center books and have read all but two of them. I love the action and suspense and the characters are great. This book had potential, but was ruined when Paul Hood was removed from Op-Center. He has been the central character throughout the series and to remove him is absolutely absurd. It would have been different if he retired or quit on his own, but he was fired and a general took his place. Throughout the book I hoped that Hood would regain his job, or that the tyrant general would get fired. At the end I was thoroughly dissapointed to find that Bob Herbert, another main character, was fired. I felt as though the enemy had won for the first time in this series. I have never written an online review before, but I felt that it was necessary in this case so that Op-Center fans could avoid this horrible book."
4,Good Transition,"This was a good transition book in the Op-Center series. While it was slow going at times, it did lay out the pattern for new Op-Center spin-offs. Over-all it was a great book."
4,Very good as always,This book breaks your mind right up front.I have read and followed the op center series.It's a great series.
5,It works!,"Since getting the Flipper, we have eliminated the gray squirrel problem entirely. Occasionally a ""new"" squirrel comes along and attempts to stretch himself from the top to the opening to get at the feed hole. Not one has succeeded. From time to time I hear a knock on my office wall only to discover that another squirrel has been flipped. This device should stop your squirrel problem for good."
2,"spills seeds, not entertaining, not really worth it","This design has no tray to stop seeds from falling to the ground. I have watched small birds knock 5 sunflower seeds to the ground, eat one, knock 5 to the ground, eat one, etc. The squirrels are getting more seeds now from the ground than from our old feeder that they would occasionally jump to.I have twice seen the feeder swinging wildly no doubt from a squirrel, but have never actually seen a squirrel on it, so don't expect any entertainment like shown on the video."
1,Total Junk,Tabs made of plastic broke within 2 weeks and the base falls on the ground. Company sent replacement part which changed the tension and now it won't keep the squirrels off. I want to see about getting my money back. Don't waste your time with this one!
3,Squirrels love to spin!,"We have had our Yankee Flipper for 2 years now. As time goes by the squirrels have become so used to ""riding the flipper"" that it has become a way for them to get the seed on the ground. As they spin on the base the seed spills out to the ground below allowing the little rodents to eat and eat, and spin and spin!! Today I counted 8 squirrels out there, all taking a turn on the ""wheel of fortune"". My husband spent this weekend making a baffel from 6"" pipe to prevent the critters from crawling up the pole. After exhausting all efforts, I decided to call the Wild Bird Center near our home, and they recommended buying an additional extention pole to raise the feeder another 2 ft. so the squirrels can't jump up from the ground to the wheel. I won't let them win!!!!!!!!!"
1,Waste of money,"This feeder has definite entertainment value, until the squirrels figure it out. The gray squirrels in our yard have found several ways to beat it, or to run the battery down. With a dead battery, even the not-so-smart ones can feed from it until they have emptied it of bird seed. Forget this feeder; it just isn't worth the high price."
1,Feh - unpopular with cardinals - dumps seed...,"I don't know about this feeder - seems I'm now roaring through even more seed, with tons of pigeons, squirrels underneath the feeder (not on it though - suddenly 6 or 8 inches of seed will disappear - I think it dumps seed on the ground with the wind.Also, my cardinals and other bright and interesting birds, don't appear to like the feeder. Small sparrows, pigeons and squirrels love it. Maybe I'll go back to having a squirrel acrobatically nabbing food, but use less seed, and get my pretty birds back..."
4,squirrel found a new way,"It works great as long as the squirrel gets onto the wire spinner, but not when the varmint comes UP THROUGH the wires. Our furry genius jumps and grabs the bottom-most plate with his front feet. Then he swings his hind feet up to the same plate, turns loose with the front ones, and raises his body through the wires. He holds onto the seed opening with one front foot while he stuffs his face. Must be quite comfortable--he'll stay for 15 minutes or more. Ball is in the human's court again!"
5,Make sure it's secure!,This is the third feeder like this we are buying. Raccoons can actually knock it down and drag it away. We have found parts of the others scattered throughout the woods. We love it and this time we bought a lock to keep it in the tree.
3,"Entertain, but not for the long term","Very entertaining for about a year. After years of watching squirrels steal my birdseed, it was worth it to just once see a squirrel get whipped around and around and then flipped to the ground. But after about 2 years, the battery no longer holds a charge. If it lasted a little longer, this would be the perfect feeder. But something that costs $100 should probably last longer than 2 years, in my opinion."
4,I won the war with the squirrels,I tried every type of bird feeder over a period of 4yrs and the Yankee flpper is the the real deal squirrel proof and a joy to watch the birds come and go at their ease. Drama and lots of laughs in the first few days watching them being flipped off.I congratulate the person who invented this feeder
1,False Flipper,This Squirrel Proof feeder is a great idea in theory. But they fail to tell you until you open the box and read the instructions that their Yankee Flipper doesn't work with Red Squirrels. I am now the proud owner of an expensive Red Squirrel feeder. Their claim of a Squirrel Proof feeder sounds like false advertising to me.
5,Another endorsement -- it works!,"It really keeps the grey squirrels off, and the battery goes a long time without recharging. I love it. For a full review of this and other feeders, visit my feeder review blog - Curious Wren (dot com)."
5,Very Pleased,"We have been very pleased with this product. This is the second one we have owned, but the failure of the first one was through our carelessness--we lost the charger. When we first purchased it, I was skeptical. We have an extremely large squirrel population, and everything else we had tried worked only very briefly before they figured out how to get around it. This is truly effective. It doesn't have to be charged very often. The squirrels learn quickly not to get on it. I've never actually seen it throw one off but once, but what I do see is the squirrels trying to get up the nerve to get on it. They never do. We had the last one for several years and never had a problem. I highly recommend this product if you have a serious squirrel problem."
5,Great fun!,"This is actually the second Yankee Flipper we purchased. We had the first one for a long time and it finally gave up. It is great fun to watch the squirrels' reaction as they get ""flipped off."" They learn very quickly, and the birds can enjoy their food. Highly recommend."
4,Entertaining and Effective,"You can enjoy the Flipper feeder with your morning coffee or in the middle of the afternoon before or after your nap. It keeps squirrels, chipmunks, whatever, including the heavier birds out of the seed. The squirrels generally cannot reach from the top down to the rail (unless you hang it where they can reach the rail--like on a shepherd's hook)and if they do-- OFF THEY GO! The shepherd's hook or any tree branch near to the tree trunk is perfect for the sadists among us who want to drive the squirrels nuts (pun intended). This thing works. It really,really does. Just got one for my 83 year old mother."
5,Kind Squirrel Prevention,This is the best bird feeder I have ever owned. The birds love eating from it. It prevents the squirrels from eating the bird food in a humane way. Nobody gets hurt and everyone is happy. The seed inside does not get wet because it is sealed so good.
5,Best Feeder available!,"Couldn't decide if I was purchasing this feeder to torture the squirrels or to feed the birds. Haven't seen any squirrels go flying off as shown in videos and the box, but it does the job! I've been fighting off squirrels for the past five years; they cannot get the seed in this feeder. Ordered a 2nd for myself and one for a gift!"
1,Seed dumper,"Conceptually this feeder is great. It has a squirrel activated defense mechanism. The problem is that is doesn't prevent squirrels from getting seed. If they don't figure out how to hold on a slide around the perches to eat, the amount of seed that dumps on the ground is plenty to fill their bellies. I thought the idea was to prevent the squirrels from getting seed!? Certainly not worth the $120 for this feeder"
1,Stripped gears in spinner = expensive waste of money,"This feeder violates a basic law of engineering: simpler is better. Not long after installing this pricey toy in my backyard, the gears in the spinning mechanism gave out. My conclusion was that they were stripped, although I did not take it apart to confirm that diagnosis. All I know is that the spinning mechanism stopped working. I could have shipped the unit back for repair or replacement, but who needs the hassle? My advice: stick with a feeder with no moving parts that also does not require charging. I use two Droll Yankees tube feeders hanging from a dual arm post equipped with a torpedo squirrel guard. Located at least 8 feet from the nearest tree, this set-up has completely eliminated my squirrel problem. Simple and effective."
2,Costly Mistake,"I had an old ""house style"" platform bird feeder within view of my kitchen windows. It attracted cardinals, mourning doves, blue jays, finches, etc. The birds would feed and roost around it at all times of the day. What a glorious sight. When I replaced it with the YF Flipper,all the birds disappeared. It took over three weeks before any birds returned. It will take no bird larger than the cardinal; so, gone are the blue jays and mourning doves. And the smaller birds feed and leave; they don't like to hang around this feeder. However, it does eliminate the squirrels and doesn't have to be filled so often.I'm very disappointed with this item and regret having been taken by the slick marketing video. If you don't like squirrels, buy it. If you like a large variety of birds around, don't buy it. I'm going to hang it from a tree in my side yard and put back my old feeder."
2,Droll Yankee feeder,The product was good for the first twelve months. Once the squirrels (specially the new litter of squirrels) learn that by holding and turning on the wheel food falls to the ground. It's impossible to keep the feeder full.
1,Don't buy it,"I love the concept, but honestly, the best thing about it is the video. The hopper doesn't allow the seed to flow, and I have just tramped in through a foot of snow after shaking it yet again. Seed gets stuck, and I have tried mixed seed, sunflower seed, safflower seed, finch seed. I have owned this feeder for five years, as it was a gift from my husband.Pick something else, seriously!"
3,Entertaining but not very effective,"I have a Yankee Flipper and the squirrels in my yard have figured out a way to get to the seeds in the clear plastic tube! The squirrel will go down the tube, cling onto the ring perch, and hold onto it for three or four revolutions before flying off. While the squirrel hangs on, the center of gravity of the tube becomes unbalanced and causes the tube to sway. With the tube swaying, the seeds spill out and you have some happy squirrels directly below the feeder, on the ground, waiting for the falling seeds! This squirrel did this three times in a ten minute period... he KNEW exactly how to work it! It has taken them a few years to figure this out, but they have... very smart critters!"
5,"After Ten Years, Still Going Strong!","I've been using this product for about ten years.Once, early on, the ring stopped turning when the ring was tipped. Further investigation revealed that there was so much squirrel fur jammed into the device that it stopped turning. I spent about an hour ripping the fur out. One large piece of fur had some flesh attached!So not only does this product spin off the squirrels, it occasionally demands they pay a toll in fur as well. We haven't had that problem since.Once all your local squirrels are trained to avoid this product (takes a few months or so, as I recall), they'll never even consider trying it again. I haven't seen a squirrel try to use ours for several years.The battery charge seems to last about a year or so with no squirrel action. In the beginning, when the battery was being used more, I think we typically had to recharge it every month or so.But the unit is still working after ten years and is definitely continuing to do the job that we bought it for."
3,Ok.....but....,"Got the feeder and set it up....after a couple of flips the squirrels stopped going near it, which is good, but when they flip seed goes everywhere so what was the point? Also, if you should ever need to replace the battery, I called the company, and you have to buy the whole bottom housing for $49. Nice idea but to pricey for me...."
1,What a Mess!,"We paid big bucks for this ugly feeder or I would throw it away. Sure, it protects from the squirrels but it makes a huge mess on the deck. The feeding holes are really big and I have watched as the birds eat. The bird seed just flows out the hole to the ground and gets in every flowerbed and crack in the deck. It wastes the seed because it is then mixed with dirt, leaves and hulls and we really can't put all that back in the feeder. I hate it. We have now bought a seed catcher to attach under the feeder. I hope that works. It will take days to get all that scattered seed swept up to say nothing of the time spent pulling out the seedlings from my flowerbeds. Don't waste your money on this ""toy."""
2,Loved it until...,"This feeder worked great until one morning I found the whole bottom half pulled off and on the ground. It detered the squirrels, but raccoons are a bit heavier and cleverer. One of them apparently hung on it until it came apart. (Knew it had to be them by their footprints on our deck.) Guess I'm still looking for a critter proof feeder."
2,"Unfortunately, Not squirrel proof","Much as I wanted this product to work, in less than a week, the 5 lbs of seed this feeder holds was all on the ground. I changed locations but it was the same situation. I have not actually seen a squirrel empty the feeder (could it be mourning doves, or something else?)but they are close by and feeding on ground droppings. Now I have to fill the feeder with a small amount on a daily basis just to conserve feed and be able to feed some birds before it is emptied (usually within a few hours of being filled no matter what time of day). I will try the Brome Squirrel Buster next but it also appeared to have mixed success."
3,Works great...until...,"This feeder is a lot of fun and it works great until the squirrels figure it out. It's easy for the smaller red squirrels and, eventually a gray squirrel will beat it and it's all over. When a gray squirrel finds a position that allows him to feed while the Flipper spins he can very quickly exhaust the battery, allowing him and other squirrels to feed effortlessly. See for yourself. Do a search on youtube for ""Squirrel vs. Droll Yankee Flipper"". (Amazon won't allow me to post the actual link)."
1,Wastes bird seed,"Does this bird feeder twirl squirrels? Yes it does. However, its design wastes more bird seed than my prior bird feeders because there is no platform for the seed to fall onto. Therefore it all falls on the ground. I have to fill this feeder once a week. That is a LOT of seed. Most of the seed falls on the ground and gets eaten by.....yes, you guessed it, the squirrels.Oh, and by the way, I tried the other Droll Yankees bird feeder that has a seed platform, but the squirrels found a way to hang on to the platform and shovel seed onto the ground.So I am back to seed-on-ground zero.Don't pay the big bucks to buy this bird feeder. It's really a powered, twirling squirrel feeder."
2,"Yes, it's squirrel-proof, but...","...it's not dove-proof. Doves eat as much as squirrels do, and the ones around my house have learned how to alight on the perch without setting it off. So, regretfully, I'll be selling my Yankee Flipper in the classifieds soon, and replacing it with something more pressure sensitive. The feeder is as sturdy and attractive as advertised, I must stress, and it didn't take long for squirrels to give up trying to get into it. If you have no doves in your area, feel free to disregard this review."
5,Great bird feeder,"This is our third one of these feeders. Birds love them and it's really fun watching squirrels try to figure out how to use them. We live right on the Mississippi River, so we get a wide variety of birds and these feeders are tops in our book!"
5,Worth Every Penny!!!,"It took me about a year and a half to finally break down and buy this feeder. The crafty squirrels in my yard would routinely completely empty my feeder on a daily basis, by ripping the top off, eating it off or tipping it over! You WILL save alot of money by owning this feeder because of the amount of seed you will be saving. The squirrels were NOT able to remove the top or eat this feeder, and when they took a spin, they usually never attempted to get on this feeder again. I fill it about once a week, and the squirrels have to eat whatever is on the ground. Should have purchased it sooner...we love it!"
4,great feeder,Works great and the birds including woodpeckers seem to enjoy it . The squirrels learn fast it was fun to watch.
4,perfect !,I revised this review because of the awesome service of Yankee Droll. The new flippers rule!
3,worthless guarantee,"I think the feeder is an expensive ripoff due to a pitiful guarantee. This gift from my son didn't come with a sales receipt. When the battery died after two years of recharging.I couldn't mail the tower in for repair. If ther are only 2 screws in the battery case, it can be opened and batteries from the company website can be used to repair it. Mine had 4 screws to remove to open the case, and it was a unusual battery within. I wouldn't remove it(per factory directions). It is now a very expensive bird AND SQUIRREL feeder, that doesn't fling anything off. HOW DROLL!!!"
1,"No rating given. Forget about the squirrel ""proof"" Feeders","I trap the squirrels and transport them to a wooded area several miles from my house. Transporting them can be a pain, but after catching and relocating about eight squirrels I notice few or no visits from squirrels to my feeders for a couple of months. Then I do it all over again. Relocation reduces the breeder population and I can say that I still have the occasional squirrel, but it is not a problem. Buying and working with all these so-called squirrel-proof feeders is a nuisance too and cost bucks for the feeder and wasted seed."
1,item not what was described,I thought I was purchasing a birdfeeder from the picture and the description and what I actually receivedwas a rechargable battery for the birdfeeder! I failed to read the fine print and ordered quickly from the pix and title description. Very misleading and obviously a waste of time- not to mention I didn't have the gift I wanted in time.
3,"Ultimately, it works.","We have no squirrels on the feeder. However, we might have had a racoon or two. The bottom kept falling off and after 3 times on the ground , I realized it had broken 1 of the 3 prongs that keep the battery and perch on. Bottom line, though, it now is ok and we have no squirrels.It is not quite as well made as I had hoped. the prongs are plastic and breakable."
5,Birds love it and so do I,"I have been a bird watcher and feeder for 16 years. This is the best feeder I have ever found to truly keep the squirrels out of the feeder and on the ground where they belong. It holds a lot of seed so we don't have to constantly refill it. We live in the NW where it rains a lot but the seed stays dry. And every morning the birds flock to it, mostly chickadees, finches, nuthatches, and pine siskins. We use an S hook to hang it from a tree limb, so it is easy to access. It is great!"
2,books,"I liked the book, however, it was in such poor condition, I wouldn't buy again from this seller."
3,"Tangles, tangles, tangles","If only one of these necklaces is worn, it makes for pretty and fun look. Warning: it will tangle on itself VERY easily so be careful when handling it. I wore one on a sweater and it stayed put probably because it stuck to the sweater. It's too bad they can't be worn together as displayed because this is the look I wanted. The shamrocks are plastic and are held together by a dark cord. Would I recommend these to friend? Nope!"
3,good for elementary level,"This text book is a very good guide for undergraduate level student for corporate strategy. However, it does not provide fruitful thought for doctoral student, like me."
3,Could have been better written,"This text is a brief overview of Corporate Strategy--more useful to someone who already knows the subject and needs a book to brush up on the material and ""pull it all together."" Concepts are not elaborated very well, forcing you to read passages twice. I also felt that sentences weren't structured in a very readable manner."
3,Does the job but is made Cheaply,"It works well, but the keys feel feel fragile and slightly uncomfortable. The cable also seems like it may tear at any moment. At the end of the day it does the job, but it feels like that's all the company is trying to do. It feels very cheap.-The package says that the keypad works only with Windows operating systems, but it works fine with my MAC."
3,Great if you need a USB keypad,"The Adesso keypad is fine but not crazy about the retractable usb cord. It felt a little flimsy like it would pull off the keypad and didn't retract quite right for me. On the positive side, this product was okay overall and worked as described if you need a numeric keypad for your laptop. I bought this to do some work on taxes and I'm glad I did. So long as the USB retractable cord doesn't fail, this was a good purchase especially for the price. You can easily toss this into your computer bag and use when needed. It's hard to get excited over a numeric keypad, but hey, yahoooooo! Also, you can't beat this for the price, other are much more and I'm not sure they have any added value over this one."
3,Not bad,"We got two of these for the laptops our kids use for home school. They work fine, but they could stand to be a bit heavier as they tend to slide around a bit."
4,No issues with use. Mac friendly. Great deal.,"I have a macbook & I had zero issues. It was total plug & play. However, I must say I looked at the instructions from the other reviews and implemented them upon first use. I have had absolutely no problems with the use. I do wish there was an = sign on the keyboard, but it's really not a big deal for me. Also, the cord is a little difficult when retracting it. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
4,"Satisfied, not enamored...","I've been using this for a couple of days now with my Macbook Pro. I find that it works just fine in Mac OS and also in Bootcamp. It did not recognize the keyboard upon installation but don't worry, just select the USA keyboard setting in the installation screen and it works fine.I use this almost exclusively with Excel, and just as another reviewer said it would be great to have an ='s key so that I don't have to switch between keyboard and keypad so much. It doesn't bother me that much since I usually use ='s in conjunction with a function and parenthesis. Also I find that the 000 key is useful, yet a little annoying since I accidentally hit it with my thumb more than I would like.Overall in terms of compatibility and portability this is a pretty good product. I would recommend it, though it is not quite perfect."
2,For Some This May Make Sense,"Yes it works, but....I've got to tell you, for someone to design an adding machine without thinking to include an equals key... well that kind of sums it up for me."
1,"Looks ok, but doesn't work properly","I purchased this produc for my ultrabook which doesn't have a numerical keypad. When I tried it out it seemed quite cheaply manufactured, but its priced implied this too. I wouldn't have mind this, but when I pressed 8, it would type 87. Sent it back to Amazon."
2,Good while it lasted,"I have had this keypad for exactly 13 months. For the time I had it I used it several times a week with a windows laptop. It worked well, was easy to transport, and I loved the retractable cord. Unfortunately it just went out today from what appears to be a bad connection in the cord (when I press on it or wiggle it I can get it to work momentarily).If you think the price is good for a years worth of use then go for it. I personally feel like their should be a longer life than one year."
5,works,"Works as advertised. I found the cord long enough for my Macbook, could be a bit short for the larger Macbook Pro however.Plugged it in and just started using it, no software setting to change, then again I'm using the most current OS on the Macbook."
1,Doesn't work on Mac??? :(,"OK, it doesn't claim Mac compatibility explicitly, but there aren't many USB devices that don't work fine there. This doesn't... If you have a Windoze box, this may work fine, but DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A MAC!Also, that packaging sucks. One of those theft-proof packages that must be destroyed completely with a utility knife in order to extract the product... :("
4,My mother swears by it.,"My 78 year old mother is the treasurer of her church and does a lot of data entry, so I got this as a supplement to the laptop I bought her. She's used it way more than I have, so this review is a combination of both our views.First, as many other reviewers have noted, this is a pretty bare bones entry level numeric keypad and it is priced accordingly. It doesn't have any special Excel keys, it isn't tilted at any special angle to make keying in easier and it doesn't have any quick response, light to the touch keys. If you're doing anything but adding columns of numbers this is probably not for you. But my mother has used this baby every week for about a year and it's held up well and she can't imagine being without it."
5,The best tube feeder,I've used this feeder for over 20 years and recently replaced the poly tube. Easy to fill and clean. The nice thing is that you can get parts for this feeder and it will far outlast the newer plastic feeders. The pewer top and fittings will last forever.I just bought a second Droll A6F to replace a plastic feeder (less than 2 years old) that cracked under the weather. I also added the seed tray to catch uneaten seed.
2,Bird feeder,"Prior to this bird feeder I had a plane ""house"" type feeder where the birds could feed from both sides. With this feeder I have only seen 1 bird feeding."
4,Birds love this feeder!,"I bought this for my husband for a Christmas present. He loves it and the birds do too. It also is good if you are not wanting squirrels in your backyard. I have purchased many bird feeders for him over the years, and this is by far the best one."
2,Whitewash,"As an honest biography of the industrialist, you can pretty much skip this one. This book was commissioned by the family, I believe, and published under their control, so you won't read much in it but veneration for Papa. Frick's daughter famously prevented any real biography from being written about him until well after her death some years ago, and I guess a lot of the real information was simply destroyed before that book could be written. But maybe the one that came out in 1998 has more of the real skinny on this sometimes awesome, sometimes just ugly major figure in the rise of the coal and steel industries in the late 19th century."
5,A Compelling Study of Louis Nowra's Work!,"This book is the ultimate reference guide to the works of one of Australia's greatest contemporary playwrights, namely, Louis Nowra.Professor Veronica Kelly presents a clearly written, and passoniate account of the life and works of a fascinating man, not to mention a highly prolific playwright.A MUST for anyone interested in Australian drama or a Nowra fan like me!"
4,Amusing and informative,I'm enjoying this book. It is informative and fun and kept my interest even when the alternative leisurely pursuit was people watching on a Caribbean beach - so that can't be bad. The point the author wishes to make is zebras don't get ulcers because their stress comes from occasional short-lived encounters with lions. On the contrary our stresses are constantly trickling if not constantly full-on. This eventually throws our whole body into disarray. I am studying a nutrition course and the book was recommended as part of this (it doesn't have much to do with nutrition however) but it would be perfectly readable for those with little biological technical knowledge. I am also tempted to read others by the author as I'm impressed by the writing style. Just an FYI: I'm from the UK and had to buy this book from Amazon US because it was (currently) difficult to obtain over here.
4,"A good book, but not an easy read","This book is sort of betwixt and between. It's trying to be a layman's guide to the physiology and psychology of stress, and it does a good job, but you'll need to dig out some of your high school biology to understand it.Sapolsky clearly understands the subject very well, and he writes well, but there's really no way to minimize the complexity of stress physiology. So buy the book, by all means, but don't expect to breeze through it like a typical self-help book."
4,Fight or Flight,Interesting book. Allostasis - fight or flight. Wriiten so that subject matter can be understood.
2,Lots of information...but where's the help?,"A therapist suggested I get this book to better understand my anxiety. I could have strangled him! This book made me feel worse. I already know that stress is a killer. If you want to understand why stress is so bad for you then this book will be very helpful. The research is extensive and very informative. However, I was hoping for some suggestions on how to overcome the biology that causes stress-related disorders. I know I am not a zebra - so what do I do about it? There is very little help here. I was expecting a huge section on strategies to get out of the fight or flight response - and did not find them. Well written though."
3,Everything you already knew...,"Okay. I know stress and anxiety can make me ill. I even understand the basic physiology involved. This book tells me all that - yet again - BUT with plenty of footnotes and a catchy title and cute cover graphic. ""Psychophysiological death"", gluco-steroid levels, and stress dwarfism may all be medically interesting topics, but are they really helpful to the average person in managing or understanding stress and anxiety? Finally, it turns out that zebras DO get ulcers - when they are under unusual stress. Go figure."
2,Why Zebras don't get ulcers,why zebras don't get ulcers - was not what i thought is was not my cup of tea at all
2,h. pylori causes stomach ulcers,"it is a cute title and we all scientists try so hard. I think the author is just another aggrandizing person. like TED, just a way to catch interest and attention. congratulate yourself on something new or try to seem like you have something substantive to say.a bacterium causes ulcers, not stress.[...][...]sure, stress is a huge deal in health. fortunately, the human body has evolved and is designed to keep alive. prefrontal cortex and limbic stress is not something to consider in physical health. just if you want to be happy and peaceful, it is something to consider. so I politely defer."
1,Not for avarage person,This was a little to complicated for me. Everyhting was explained by science etc. I don't think an avarage person would enjoy this at all.
4,Very clear and interesting,"Suddenly I found out that my co-workers needed medicines to go on with their lives, a friend of mine is a workaholic and she has terrible stomachaches, another one took her life after a long depression following a very stressful time, ...My life is great but sometimes I have to fight against anxiety that comes from I do not know where...I read this book and now at least I have an explanation, a scientific model for certain behaviours.The language is so clear that anyone can understand what stress is, how it affects our bodies, why some people develop ulcer and others do not. And it is funny, entertaining, telling little stories as well as technical data.It is exactly what a scientific book for the masses must be. I highly recommend it."
5,"good read for scientists, normal people, or zebras","Sapolsky is great at making the medical knowledge of stress physiology useful and palatable to normal people without dumbing it down. It had enough citations, references, and detailed explanations to satisfy the scientist in me, but was complete and accessible enough that my mother could get a lot out of it.Also note that the 3rd edition is not just a new printing; it has major additions, updates and improvements over the 2nd."
5,Great for Stress Relief,"When reading advice books it's pretty rare to think ""this book was written for me"" yet if you suffer from panic attacks that's exactly what will happen when you crack open When Zebra's Don't get Ulcers. Sapolsky made me laugh, he made me cringe, and most importantly he led me to draw some serious correlations between his examples and my own personal experiences. This book has helped me imensly, while at the same time simply being an excellent fun read. I highly recommend to both readers looking for answers about panic attacks & stress related issues, or someone looking for a fun read. On a side note the audible version is excellent as well."
2,Not a great buy for older laptops,"I mostly thought about getting USB 2.0 on my old notebook, but got absolutelly no use out of this unit. Notebook would ""loose interest"" in this adapter after each time it goes to sleep, and I'd have to reboot it to ""find"" it again. When tried using it on my other older notebook, it would lock the computer due to a driver compatibility...Not the greatest idea after all, money wasted... May do better for newer notebooks, but they arleady come with USB 2.0 so what's the use, right?"
3,can not handle the heat,"Got a two for one deal I could not resist, and received them quickly. I needed more usb ports on my Dell laptops (with Windows 2000), and they installed smoothly. However, once I pugged in a device that required 5vdc, the pcmcia card began to heat up...to the point of melting the plastic near the ports. Then the laptops just locked up. I returned the product for a prompt refund. For additional communication ports, this may be a good solution, but I wouldn't power anything with these."
4,Great for old laptops,"This card is actually pretty good.I bought it for my sister's old laptop that only had one USB port, and that one USB port started malfunctioning.Unfortunately, this card (along with every other USB expansion card) requires it to be powered by USB. (It comes with a USB power cable that plugs into the USB card and into the existing USB port on the computer.) Luckily, it only seems to use this for power and it somehow it works with the malfunctioning USB port. However, if your laptop doesn't have any USB ports at all, then this won't work for you. (It didn't work until I plugged in the USB power cable.)Also, you might as well buy the cheapest one of these USB cards that you can find, since they're all exactly the same."
1,Spend the extra money and get a good adapter.,This adapter was a rip off. I purchased this for an upgrade. The generic drivers that run this will not read my external hard drives or usb hub. Overall a very disapointing purchase.
1,Flat out doesnt work,"As soon as I inserted it into my laptop, my whole system locked up. As soon as I ejected it, laptop returned to normal. Pony up and get a higher priced one."
2,Confused?????,This card apparently loads immediately as you insert it into your dell latitude c610 laptop using drivers from windows. These drivers don't work well for this product and the cd-rom that came with the product does not clearly define how to install the drivers for maximum results. Its certainly not plug and play ready. I feel cheated as an overseas buyer. Sabrent should explain in detail how to install its drivers instead of giving their customers all this guess-work to do.
5,just as described,I just received the Stove Topper & Cutting Board so I can't yet comment on its use. But I'm happy b/c it fits over our RV's 3-burner stove perfectly. And bonus!....it came with a bonus flexible cutting mat. I love free extra stuff!!
5,Love This Topper!,"I received my rv stove top cutting board topper today. It is a perfect fit and love the fact that it won't be moving around in transit, because it is lined on the under side. Mine actually looks better then the one shown, it has a beautiful wood grain on it. I was happy to receive the bonus acrylic cutting pad that came with it. Will be so nice to have the extra room to prepare food too! In our last motorhome we orderd the metal fold up topper, never liked it because it did not allow you to go past the cover if you had a bigger skillet, now no worries with this topper. Now I have to go find some mineral oil for it. Thanks Amazon for another great product!"
5,perfect fit,cutting board fits perfectly on top of the stove and adds needed counter space. the non-stick back prevents it from sliding off the stove.
5,Exactly what I needed!,"I have a small studio apt in Manhattan. The kitchen is very small and has about 1 foot of counter space total. This cutting board was a perfect fit for my smaller stove top and more than doubled my counterspace. The rubber backing on the bottom side holds the cutting board in place so there is no movement or sliding when using it. I received a smaller, flexible cutting-board sheet that can be used on top of the wooden cutting board to keep it clean. Also, the flexible sheet is great when chopping vegetables and just folding it up and sliding the vegetables into the next container or bowl.I'm very pleased!"
4,Excellent book for new car buyers,"Even if you don't own a new Land Rover the book is very good! My Land Rover 90 2.5L Diesel was purchased third-hand, neglected, and in 'potentially' poor condition. This book helped greatly where my OEM Italian manual lacked (90% of the time). If any owner purchases this book with a new Rover, follows Mr. Porters advice, and uses it in lieu of the provided service manual, his/her Rover will last a lifetime! Guaranteed! I wish my Rover was new so I wouldn't have to complete every required maintenance to 65K miles.-D. Robertson"
2,To great expectations...,"Although bearing some good information, this book was a bit upseting for me. There are two or three chapters with no more than two pages! On the other hand, there is a lot of space wasted. I expected much more information and pictures."
3,Can improve,"Although it contains a lot of useful information, I found it lacking where it comes to really important hints to repair the engine (2,5Tdi). Most of the bodywork I will never try to do myself due to the specialist nature. But I find it disappointing that not much is said about the inside of the engine while so much is said about bodywork (which cannot let you down as an engine can)."
4,Great 60's Harmonies,"This little-known group really could put out great songs. Their covers of ""Who Do You Love"" and ""I Have a Boyfriend"" are right on target with fresh teen harmony and big music backgrounds. The cover is worth the price of the CD - the best bouffant flips ever seen outside the Ronettes! Great addition to your 60's teen queen collection."
2,Collectables' Always Messes Up A Good Thing,"I ordered this CD because of my love for girl-groups and of Reparata and the Delrons singles ""Panic,"" ""Captain of Your Ship,"" ""Nobody's Baby Now,"" ""I Have A Boyfriends,"" and ""Tommy"".Surpirise! Out of all the ONLY songs I like by them only two made it on to this disc! Lucky me! At least I could find ""Panic"" and ""Captain of Your Ship"" on KaZaa."
4,Reissue of an original 1965 LP + 6 bonus tracks,"I thought I had to specify what this CD is about, since some other customers complained about some missing hits: this isn't a compilation nor a Best Of here, but the reissue of the band's first original LP released in early 1965, not long after the hit of the title-track (which remains one of the most lovely hits of the girl group era). This reissue respects the original sequencing of the vinyl LP with the first twelve tracks, then adds 6 bonus ones. If you want a more comprehensive collection, purchase the Ace one. But here's some songs you won't find on the Ace collection either, such as the cover of the Beatles If I Fell.Anyway, anything by Reparata & the Delrons is worth the purchase. To my taste, it's one of the ten best girl groups of the sixties (with the Shangri-Las, the Ronettes, the Tammys, Martha & the Vandellas, the Paris Sisters, the Shirelles, the Exciters, the Supremes, the Crystals and choose your tenth one)."
3,Not Bad but fairly predictable,"Ben affleck and Uma Thurman star is John Woo's latest offering. Mr. Affleck has had his memory erased, but knowing this was likely to happen left himself 13 clues to help him reclaim his life, get the girl, kill all the baddies and ride fast on a motorcycle. Plenty of two gun unlimited magazine style action, and actually looks quite good, despite Mr. Woo's penchant for ""SfX Overload"" and ""lets use more ammo than the A team"" style of direction. A little better than most mindless action movies, one or two twists, but even the most indifferent viewer should have figured it all out way before the end."
4,Fun and Entertaining.,"A fun action flick, well done, excellent for an evenings entertainment. Recommended with a great bucket of popcorn, and some good friends."
4,Mind wipe for money,"A contract trouble shooter who gets his memory wiped fortwo month jobs, take a deadly three year contract.As usual he is successful, but this time maybe too much so?Can he decode his message to himself before his former friend andboss erases him? The twisting of the plot involves a pretty blondand the future.Good sci fi if the acting and directing lack a little."
3,Paycheck,"Slick, big budget. Lots of great stunts. Uma Thurman rocks - as usual. Ben - well, he's just Ben. Nothing spectacular, but not bad. Closing scene - doesn't fit the rest of the movie. Judge for yourself."
2,No chemistry,"As has been mentioned before, this movie is based on a story by the same author that brought us Total Recall, Minority Report and Blade Runner..... big surprise..... you might have guessed that anyway even if you were not told this fact since these movies share a similiar theme.In fact even before I knew this information I had commented that PAYCHECK looked like a basic re-hash of the TOTAL RECALL movie.Anyway what killed this film for me was the following....1) NO CHEMISTRYThere was zero screen chemistry between Ben Affleck and Uma Thurman... they were very stiff acting in this film.2) STUPID STUNTSTHe one thing I often dislike in Woo films is the stupid stunts.... for example in this film, drop the gun clip, kick it into an electric train rail, watch the clip explode, escape under the resulting smoke cover, etc....GO ahead try this stunt tonight.I bet you could try it 3000 times and NEVER get the gun clip to explode.Definately not a movie that will end up in our DVD collection."
5,Paycheck ... The Bonus,"Thoroughly enjoyable film! I knew little about the content before I saw it other than it came from John Woo whose work I really admire, and had a cast and storyline (the few clips depicted in the trailers) that looked appealing. And it certainly was!!!The film did not let me down ... plenty of action, fast-moving, high tech and cleverly done. It was well acted, and great entertainment...a wonderful way to de-stress from post holiday mania! I've recommended it to my friends and recommend it to you as well...happy viewing!"
4,Great flick,Very good action story that I enjoyed watching. Ben Affleck was great in the role. Believable science fiction that makes you wonder.
2,"Started out great, finished pretty cheese ball style",This story had a lot of potential. Beginning was great. They they make Ben Affleck's character out to be some sort of super hero. Big explosions. All that. Got pretty cheezy towards the end.
3,Enjoyable,Interesting story line - concept. It was an enjoyable way to pass a little time. I recommend it to any action/sci-fi fan.
2,Time I will never get back,"This movie is the poster-child for a Hollywood blockbuster gone awry. Big names in front of and behind the camera, a big budget and a terrific premise, but the script sucks, Ben Affleck is a weak actor at the best of times, and Uma Thurman wasn't given enough to work with. At the end, I couldn't help be feel just a bit resentful that the time spent watching could have been spent doing so many other (less painful) things. The two stars are for the interesting premise and some passable action scenes by a director who is capable of better work."
5,Best Movie. Ever.,"The title says it all. ""Best Movie. Ever.""I've seen it 8 times, and can't wait to watch it tomarrow!Get this movie!!!"
5,Exceptional Movie,"This film has to be one of Ben Affleck's best movies, his acting in this film is basically brilliant, the co-stars are perfectly matched and the film as a whole highly instense and very entertaining. This film will satisfy both the science fiction affectionado as well as the serious drama fan."
3,nothing new here,"It wasn't bad enough to walk out of, or good enough to get excited about. It's the kind of mindless movie you forget in a day or so. Others have describled the plot; I will just add a few thoughts: (1) constant showers of glass -- are some people still thrilled by breakind safefy glass? (2) Interminable, nothing new chase scene (3)plot holes you could drive the starship ""Enterprise"" though. When your plot subject matter includes time travel, you should follow the well-known rules perfected by writers over the decades. While I didn't always know what was coming next, the story was given away early on; most damningly, there was an easy fix for Affleck's character that he obviously dismissed because it would have erased the second half of the film."
1,Stinks On Ice,"I was a captive audience. Our boy scout troup was visiting a Navy base and we got to see this turkey for free. Those who chose (wisely, I might add!)not to see it, went bowling instead. So the transportation vehicles were over at the bowling alley.Anyone who compares Ben with Cary Grant doesn't have a clue about talent, style, stage presence and sex appeal. Ben has zilch. I also don't know whats up with Uma; she's bland, not pretty and was only good in The Truth About Cats and Dogs. She's a dog! The scene where she jumps off a moving motorcycle while be shot at, to go back and pick up the envelope she dropped was so ridiculous. A five year old could have shot and killed her on the spot. There were so many holes in this plot, they should have name it ""Swiss Cheese""! B-O-R-I-N-G. If the audiences applauded at the end of the movie, its because they were glad it was finally OVER!!!!!!"
1,Docked!,Roger Ebert hated this movie. So did I. This heretofore unimaginable confluence of opinion means one of us has to die
2,what a shame,"Ben Afleck plays a guy who works for high tech security companies, where he takes apart technology in order to learn how it is created, and how it works. Once he figures that out, the companies who hire him erase his memory so that he cannot sell or trade that information to other companies. After a 3 year project, he is supposed to get a big paycheck, but when he goes to pick it up he finds an envelope with several ordinary items. For the first hour of this film I was really enjoying myself, I recall thinking that Hollywood had done it right. The story was pretty original and intriguing, it kept me guessing. I think they fired the writing team as they neared the end of the story, and left the special effects and action guys to fill it in. At the end we are forced to endure typical Hollywood-style explosions and fights. I was very disappointed."
3,About your average action movie,"Quite frankly, I liked the movie. However, my wife, son, and his girlfriend, thought it was only average so I rated it that way. Ben Affleck seems so stiff. Maybe it is because his is always in stiff roles? Lot of holes in the screenplay. If you enjoy action, though, you will like this movie."
2,Cliche - check,"Wildly implausible and surprisingly boring. You get the two guys pointing guns at each other, the dove, car chase against the direction of traffic, etc. Car chases on wet streets when you can see the sun is out and its dry a block away.Apparently, John Woo's memory has been erased since he's done all this before--and many times. About the only good thing is, it doesn't have Tom Cruise in it."
2,Alright,"This movie reminds me of Independence Day with Will Smith.In this movie Ben Affleck tries to be like some action camera that can fight and win the girl; well, that did not fit him at all.Movies about the future are so played, every director seems to have tried it one way or the other."
5,What's in your wallet?,"This is an excellent sci-fi film. A young man (Affleck) has his memory wiped after every job, but his paycheck more than makes up for all the lost time. But he becomes confused when he wakes up from the latest memory wipe and finds that he has forfeited his paycheck. He has to go back to a time he can't remember to find out what happened to his paycheck and how a mysterious woman (Thurman) fits into his past with only twenty items he mailed to himself to help him."
4,"Critics, listen up, Are you people kidding me?!?!?!","Why oh why do people nip-pick like they are the best critics in the world. This movie is probably one of the better movies that Afflec has done in his whole movie career. I'm not saying the movie is ""one of the best movies"" in the whole entire world. . . i.e. Shawshank Redemption... having said that, this movie keeps your mind going, keep your mind thinking, and overall, it is entertaining, no one deserve an OSCAR Award, well maybe the Parrot, but it is a good good good movie, would of got 5 Stars if we could really tell the future. :) lol Just kidding, thats not why it didnt get a 5 stars, for a 5 stars i think this movie should of had a bigger twist at the end or even for the fact that it leaves you wanting a little more than how it ended. People give 5 stars like there are generals or the government. lol."
3,It wasn't bad...,"..But it wasn't good, either. This movie needs to be approached with a healthy dose of cynicism and popcorn, because it seems that every five minutes, the characters are tripping and falling into plot holes. Ben ""What? I'm playing a smart character this time?"" Afflek proves just why he's a box-office flop: The guy can't act to save his soul from satan. And that's saying something, because satan's got pretty low standards. The whole concept is interesting, with the packet of items being ""Sent ahead"" in time... sort of... But the ending was so obvious that I could see it coming like a horrible, horrible train wreck that you can't stop. ""Ha ha!"" The peasants rejoice: ""We've won the lottery for ourselves!""Bah."
2,PAYCHECK,"I was very dissapointed with this movie for one reason the principal actors and director are not suited to this type of film.Despite Ben Affleck's goofy reputation, he is a good actor; given the right type of role. As an action hero he is a total no-no, he just seems bemused for nearly two hours. He should stick with films like Dogma or Chasing Amy; where he can show his cynical side. As for Uma Thurman (outstanding in Kill Bill) she is just plain annoying as a spunky side kick. The real dissapointment is John Woo, making a light-weight action movie of MCG Proportions. Fair enough he certainly can't make another 'Hard Boiled' for the American market but he still made 'Face Off' and 'Windtalkers'. A diet coke action movie through and through!"
1,"Poor movie, only good thing is Aaron Eckhart","Poor movie, poor action sequences and terrible directing. I tried to like it and I know agree with the critics on this movie. Definetly don't recommend this movie."
1,"No, not again!",What is up with all these crappy film versions of classic Philip K. Dick novels/stories!? This is an absolute mess of a film that has no idea what it wants to achieve. Pure drivel.
1,Terrible in every way,"Man this is bad. Stupid story full of gaping plot holes, wretched flat performances from both lead actors, and tedious stunts. It's time to admit that Woo is simply a bad director, unable to capture any of the qualities that made him good ten years ago. He's still into the sappy symbolism (a flying white dove! Means freedom!), stupidly big explosions, and puts not one but TWO references to the famous point-blank-guns-pointed-at-each-other pose from the Killers.The one redeeming thing is that Woo *didn't* use the alternate ending that's one of the special features on this DVD: a gut-churningly bad scene that has Ben recovering a diamond ring and proposing to Uma as she flutters her hands with joy."
2,"Dull, Duller, Dullest","Formula: take an OK story snippet that involves enough sci-fi buzzing sounds and light effects, give it to John Woo with a huge production budget, add Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman, Aaron Eckhart, Paul Giamatti, Colm Feore, Michael C. Hall (each of whom is far superior to the tacky script and tired body shenanigans), add a very loud and noisy score by Paul Horn, James McKee Smith, John Powell and John Ashton Thomas, and mix it with tired contrived gimmicks that perhaps at one point in time were meant to defy belief, and voila! You have PAYCHECK.One wonders when Hollywood will realize that the market for this particular clone of movie is saturated and move on to something else. Or perhaps it is viewing this turkey immediately after viewing the brilliant and budget-limited film ""11:14"" that points out all of its weak points. But that is being kind. This movie simply isn't worth your time. And these actors should have passed on the project. Grady Harp, October 05"
1,didn't woo me with gun vs. fist,"usually i can check out intellectually and enjoy an action movie. e.g. The Sixth Day, when Schwarzenegger says ""We should smoke cigars more often,"" i distinctly remember thinking that it was total trash, and i loved it.not so with Paycheck. started to lose me when the big action hero made an escape with a bus pass. conspicuous product placement was offputting.i lost count of the nonsensical firearm standoffs after the third one. i guess if there is a shootout and a guy gets a clear shot and doesn't take it, it feels like the story has stopped; it's like you can see the writer hunched over his notebook, scratching his headsummary: Paycheck is competently shot and well-produced all around, but the screenplay is simply lazy. the logic behind the action doesn't hold up"
2,dont bother,the cast does not make up for the flaws in the scenario. many elements don't add up in the plot. production is so so...
2,"Wasn't a total waste of time, but...","An okay movie with an interesting plot. The acting is nothing special, even from Uma Thurman, who I normally really like. The fight scenes are very choreographed, with little realistic reaction from the fighters, but not as bad as `Daredevil'.But the biggest problem I had was how stupid the bad guys were. I mean, talk about morons. Not only does one set try to follow Affleck's character through a small pipe -- in a car -- which they obviously can't fit through (and promptly spectacularly blowing up), but the Chief Bad Guy has poor deductive skills when it comes to predicting what Affleck's character is going to do.It wasn't a total waste of time, but it wasn't something I would have watched if I had something else to do."
1,Can I buy the memory-erasing technology?,"While the main character of this movie gave up 3 years worth of memories in exchange for $90MM, I am willing to give up the 2 hours worth of memory I consumed watching it for absolutely nothing. Regrettably, this is 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. After you divorce yourself from all logic, forgive the riduculous story stretches, and jump through all the holes in the plot, you're left with one thing: Ben Affleck. Not much of a consolation."
1,PAYCHECK indeed....,"Maybe a huge PAYCHECK was what led robot actor Affleck and famous action director John Woo to accept to wrok in this mess of an action thriller that will lead you absolutely nowhere,; it will only make you wonder how can someone accept to shoot a screenplay so stupid and full of holes like this one."
2,america's critic,um i had to watch this twice to understand this one seemed like they didnt know what they were doing the whole time it was very complex story was hard to figure out-- would not reccomend this one go watch matrix instead lmao!!
1,Awful--both funny awful and just plain bad awful.,"It's hard to believe anyone was paid money in connection with the making of this drech. It's so bad, so sad, so gosh darn pathetic in almost every way. And it sure is saying something if a movie can make Uma Thurman look awful. (We're already used to Ben Affleck looking bad.)Please, please don't both with this."
1,absolutly awful,"This movie tries so hard to be cool, but it makes the film even worse. The action is a copy from the matrix and the plot is so stupid and people thought gigli was bad, this is way worse. Doesn't make any sense."
4,I actually thought this was pretty good,"I actually thought this movie was pretty good, when you're not expecting a good movie, you get a great oe, the plot was fun, action was okay, it was intriuging,it actually seemed kinda original even though it wassn't, i'd watch it a second time, maybe on HBO, don't buy this, not worh a second see-trough,Uma was pretty goodAffleck sucks balls but does a pretty good job keeping up with Uma (as apposed to Dare-devil)"
1,"Awful, boring, useless","This movie was such a disappointment. Affleck and Thurman just can't act. They are pretty people who just can't carry a film, especially one that has the potential of having deep meaning. It's just not them. Save your money on this dog!"
2,Boring and formulaic,"Ben Affleck has done some good work (e.g., Chasing Amy) as has Ms Thurman (e.g., Kill Bill), but the two of them together had zero charisma, and Mr. Affleck in particular looked like he was sleepwalking through his lines. The movie itself is a jumble of other, better-done movies such as Total Recall, T2: Judgment Day, Charade, Mirage and even North By Northwest. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, either the future can be changed or it can't, and the movie wants to have it both ways. Even John Woo, whose direction I usually enjoy, wasn't in top form. The ham-handed introduction of his trademark pigeons at the end of the movie does him no credit."
1,The weakest PKD movie adaption yet,"This is quite bad. I wish I could solely blame Ben Affleck who is just incredibly awful and miscast in this, but I'm afraid I finally have to admit to myself that John Woo did his best work a long time ago and that much of the brilliance of his early films probably have a lot to do with Chow Yun Fat and his remarkable charisma. Oh well. I had poor expectations for this movie the minute I saw that Affleck was cast. No way in hell does he belong in a Philip K Dick story, but things are much worse than expected when you find yourself longing for Tom Cruise."
2,I am stunned to see this movie has a 3.5 star average.,"The plot was okay, but the acting was horrendous. Paul Giamatti was the only good thing about this movie. Ben Affleck is good looking, but his acting is not at its best. Uma Thurman's dialogue was so contrived and wooden - it was almost painful to listen to it. The two characters (Ben and Uma's) had NO sexual chemistry and their relationship was unbelievable from the start.I only gave this film 2 stars because the plot was pretty original. Definitely only rent this when the video store is out of everything else."
4,One of Ben Affleck's most entertaining flicks,"I know Ben Affleck has made some stinkers in his time, but I really like this movie. I think fans of sci-fi or suspense will find it entertaining."
4,The ultimate NDA (non-disclosure agreement),"4 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie Paycheck. Ben Affleck plays a computer engineer who is hired to perform long-term top secret projects for an employer and then to have his memory wiped-clean after the project/contract completes. Talk about an NDA! After he exits from hs current project, the world is upside down and he has a pocket full of odds and ends. With no memory of the last several years, he tries to understand the items in his pocket (who, what and why???). Uma Thurman has a secondary role as his girlfriend. You travel along with our lead in his quest to figure out the items and what they mean. I give this a 4 as the plot is not very guessable and it keeps you glued to the action. I highly recommend this movie; you'll be surprised to learn what his project was all about."
4,Fun & action packed,"I think people are being too critical of this film. It is very fun, and I thought it had a clever story line. You will be on the edge of your seat with it. If you watch this movie with the intent of entertainment, then you will really enjoy it. Just don't try and over analyze the science depicted; remember, it is just for fun. At the price Amazon has it for, it is worth owning if you are a movie collector.The audio/video quality is very good too."
2,Embarrasing to watch...,"It gets one star for being a Sci-Fi movie from P.K.D., it gets another one for being a fairly interesting story.That's it. In other words, J. Woo gets absolutely no credit from me for this movie beyond rallying the resources to get it done.The cinematography is well done, you can tell they put some money in this flick, but dear god, the dialogue is pathetic! It's like they wrote this for 10 year olds...""I must destroy that machine""...Ben says. Are you kidding? What a joke. I felt embarrassed sitting in the theatre at times (especially at the end, where it felt more like a Saturday Night Live spoof than a cinematic climax).This movie is a dog....with lots of fleas.Avoid it."
4,From the Founder of the All-Movie Guide,"What a minute. Let’s not trash this movie. Instead, let’s look at the glass as half full and not half empty. For one, this is a good old-fashioned suspense/action (science fiction!) movie, with no cartoonesque quality, no larger-than-life stuff, and only a teeny-weeny bit of camp. Philip K. Dick is THE man for science fiction in our lifetimes, and even if they messed with the story, it still is better than 95% of the crap out there.It is well acted, coherent, and perhaps best of all for me, a real example of a science fiction film, as we like it, and not some over exaggerated bit of nothing. This is straight-ahead science fiction. Despite its flaws, I only wish I could find one movie of this quality a month. I liked it.-- Michael Erlewine, Founder of the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com)"
3,Better Than Some Reviews Would Indicate,"I just rented this movie today for the first time and really wasn't expecting too much. I dislike Ben Affleck's acting and John Woo hasn't made a good film in some time now. Surprisingly, Affleck is decent here and the premise with all the clues was very intriguing. Worth renting if your into Sci-Fi films.3.5 out of 5 stars"
1,PoE Tester - failed to work,"Device arrived with a rattle. Partially worked for a while then it failed. Does not identify 802.3af vs. 802.3at. Too bad, Microsemi appears to be the dominant PoE midspan vendor. I wish their gear worked."
3,"Neither ""Phobos"" nor ""Of Earth And Sky""","After two fantastic CDs, this is definitely a let down. Not terrible in that the several of the tracks are covers but the first track is a very good original. But the rest is not worthy. Mr. Allison first two CD's are ""Of Earth And Sky"" (as Spirit Level) and ""Phobos""."
4,4+ ...only downfall is it isn't continuosly mixed,"Great Electronica album. this is a great album, and it is way better if you don't have to pay for it. I wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for it tho' Mark does wonders mixing his dreamy beats and soft melodies, matching them up with some freash female vocals. If you love dreamy tracks wif phat fem. vocals you're going to love this album. Reminds me of a cross between some of Oakey's phat dream tracks and sleep-walking. Enjoy this one. But don't be in a rush to get it. This is a lil ahead of its time, and will grown on you with age... Take care .o0DB0o."
2,Broken Silence,"Wha...? BROKEN SILENCE, they should have kept silent with this one! I'm not sure what Foxy and DefJam were thinking. This CD is good for two or thee songs MAYBE! Don't waste you money, borrow it from a friend, burn the two or three song to a CD and call it a day. This CD's riddled with weak lyrics, weak beats and sad guest appearances and the profanity that just gets in the way. I think someone told Foxy profanity equaled hardcore...who knows? Now that DefJam Foxy have parted ways, hopefully her next label won't lose focus of what makes Foxy foxy...tight lyrics delivered with attitude and style, phat beats and plenty of both. Pass on this one thrust me!"
1,"Dopest beats, wackest lyrics","Second time around Foxy Brown does not deliver. Some of the beats are hot as hell, but she messes them up with her wack lyrics. The [...] Jamacan thing does not suit her at all. She disses Lil'Kim but she ain't even ready for junior league, while Lil Kim is balling with the pro's. If she wants have some respect in the rap game for her lyrics, she should let Jay-Z write for her again."
3,"Foxy, you disppointed me with this one...",I went out and bought this cd because it was receiving so many good reviews. But I was very disappointed with this one from Foxy Brown. I only like maybe two songs on the whole cd. I still think she did her best with Ill Na Na. Sorry Foxy you only get three stars for this one.
3,shut up,"we all knew foxy would diss rap's favorite queen b, and lash out at natina reed, thought she was a player honey get over kurupt, still this cd is worth a listen.if you love foxy ,then this is 4 you."
2,it ok.,"Foxy ain't that tight. the beats were pretty hot, the lyrics were ok. She be biten other heads i heard alot of her lines by other mc. If you don't got the cd don't buy it, it ain't worth whatever it cost."
5,Excellent album ever,"First I really want to say that Foxy Brown does kind ah favor Trina a little bit, because they are the most Rap/Hip-Hop rappers that I ever hear and seened. Second thing that I want to say on this album is that it's the most fantastic/perfect album to buy, because it brings some of the rap/hip-hop back into rap music. And yes she can actually rap better than Lil'Kim. I really think that Foxy Brown should deserve more than 5 stars like 100 stars, she can also sing some reggae songs too. I can't wait until her fourth album comes out some time during the fall season. The people out their that are hating on Foxy, yal don't know what yal talkin about, because yal probably didn't hear or understand what her rapping is all about. That's pretty much what I have to say for Foxy Brown. I want to thank Foxy for all the credit that she put into Hip-Hop, I'm very proud of her. Don't forget your the most finest and illest rapper ever, keep on doin yo thing. Don't let them haters get to yah!"
1,VERY WEAK,"I have seen alot of people give high reviews for uncreative albums. I decided to give Foxy Brown a listen and was not surprised! You would think after album flops and years of depression (as she describes), she would have grown up. But she is as unintelligent as she was when she first came out. I think alot of artist are selling themselves out just to make a quick buck. I can careless whether Foxy Brown retires or not, because she is a very unimportant person in hip hop. I suggest that Foxy picks up a book, and read to higher her vocabulary. Please, retire and leave hip hop. You are a disgrace! People, pick up some Bahamadia. She has made an E.P. 1 1/2 years ago that is far more better than what most of these so-called ""female m.c.'s"". She will be one of the best female ""emcee's"". Mystic is a nice emcee too, although she sings with combination, she still has something interesting to rap about. Do not support THIS ALBUM! Have a happy retirement Ms. Foxy! And please don't come back!"
4,Dancehall niceness. . .,"This might be the best dancehall record of the year so far. Foxy blows it up here. The way she drifts in and out of rapping and djaying is very impressive. Foxy did a guest spot on Spragga Benz's last record and it was very good as well, and I'm glad she has fully incorporated that style into her own music because in my opinion she djays much better than she raps. Best song is Oh Yeah with Spragga, Run Dem and Tables Will Turn both Baby Cham and of course if Cham is on the album then Dave Kelly is producing them Madhouse beats on both cuts. Wayne Wonder also shows up on his own Saddest Day. And check out Na Na Be Like. On the hip-hop side check 730 because gyal got issues. Move over Lady Saw, someone is challenging that throne queen."
4,Heat,"Ever since Foxy's collabo with CNN, she has been spitting fire. This album is fill with heat. She came back with an album that captures her 1996 flow that she had on ""I Shot Ya."" The streets got a taste of the album with ""Run Dem"", ""Oh Yeah"" and ""BK Anthem."" This time around, she embraces her West Indian heritage and comes raw on the mic. I haven't heard a female spit this much venow since MC Lyte. ALl these other females had their run, now it's time for the real queen to reclaim the throne. Especially since the other self'proclaimed queeen seems to be going through an identity crisis. Definitely worth your money."
5,She Needs Ta Come Back,"I wasn't a Foxy fan when she first came out, but when I heard ""Hott Spot"" thats when I got into her and brought her second album & realized she was really talented & a very underrated female rapper..When she released this album I couldn't stop playin it..A lot of people seem to sleep on Foxy Brown's skills, but this gyrl is tight I just think she doesn't get promoted well which sucks..This was her best album to me ""The Letter"" is my number one favorite track off the album I guess cause I can relate most of what shes rappin about..She needs to hurry up & come back this tyme I hope people don't sleep on her cause Foxy is a bad chick..Buy this album"
4,Foxy Is Back!!!!!!!!!!,"Oh my God!!! Thats all I had to say when I heard this classic album. After a long wait which to fans like me seemed forever. Foxy Brown came back in the rap game July 17 2001 in full force. With production by heavy hitters such as The Neptunes (Track 7 Candy, Track 14 Gangsta Boogie) and Ski (Track 4 B.K. Anthem) she offered us a varitey of soundscapes. Most heard through the disc is her West Indies influence. Check out tracks ""Oh Yeah"", ""Tables Turn"", ""Run Dem"", and ""Na Na Be Like"" were the Brooklyn rapper switches between patios and english. But the album does have its faults like the constant mention of Prada, Gucci, Dior, and other high end brands. But don't let this keep you from buying this album. There our gems like ""730"" and the haunting ""The Letter""."
5,So bad it is funny and really bad,"The infamous Ed Wood Jr. would be a long forgotten hack had it not been for this book giving him the Worst Director Of All Time and his gem of a film ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" Worst Picture of All Time."" The Medved brothers do an incredible job of rounding up all the bad films they can and giving such categories as: Worst Rodent Movie of All Time, The Worst Title of All Time, The Worst Performance by a Novelist, The Worst Credit Line of All Time -- you get the point. That is phase one of their attack on some of the most worthless movies ever made. The second phase of their attack is the writing; cutting humor is laced into all of the works. The brothers Medved have humor with an edge that is unmatched in critiquing bad flicks. Don't be surprise to laugh out loud when reading this. The book is out of print, but can still be gotten. A must for any one that loves movies and realizes there are more bad than good movies."
4,Batman forever DVD - Amazon,"Yes, very satisfied. Let me know about a digital copy version please. Great to see and have it again. Thank you -Jon"
4,Nice Motorcycle Speakers,"I bought these little speakers for my aging front speakers for my 2003 Honda Goldwing. They are a little smaller than the originals but work just as well. Construction is very good. Don't expect much bass out of the speakers and you won't be disapointed. I chose them for the exterior use and haven't been sorry. They have been on my bike in the weather, including rain, without any problems at all."
3,Nice but Not Great!,I bought them to replace the OEM speakers in my motorcycle fairing. They're a bit brassy but that's expected with coax. I was somewhat disappointed with their lack of efficiency. Pushing these new speakers with my OEM amp makes for a lot of distortion at higher volumes. Guess I'll have to upgrade the amp.
3,an honest attempt,"I thought this picture was an honest attempt to dig deeper into the human psychie. It's not perfect by any means but it has something to say about society and the human condition. Those ""reviewers"" who complain about it being sold by ""spammers"" are just bitching about nothing. So what if the picture is being advertised by mass market media? That does not take away from what the film is trying to say and it is no reason to dump on the picture....One would almost think the complainers had a personel ax to grind with those who made the picture....What, you didn't get cast in it?"
1,Some reviews appear to be self-marketing and/or inaccurate,"Some of the reviews for this movie appear to be self-marketing attempts. The language used in these reviews is remarkably similar and the ""reviewers"" often only have reviewed this one movie. This is highly unusual. In addition, at least two reviewers included a reference to the 2002 Telluride Film Festival, perhaps to give it an air of authenticity. Upon checking, however, this was NOT one of the movies on the program during that year. I didn't check other years, but this certainly calls into question the validity of these ""reviewers"". Please proceed at your own risk."
1,New Age film based,I was very expected...but it's a new Age film who wants to see as buddhist.Dissapointed.
1,I want 87 minutes of my life back,Like the title of this review says...Really bad movie. Srange sex scene. An echo that was misheard.... Please save your time. I was disturbed and bored by this movie.
1,"Awful, just awful","This is, to put it plainly, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I cannot believe it has received these positive reviews-- or even that it has been distributed widely. The writing is awful and predictable; the acting is laughable; and the plot made me nauseous. It attempts to play on every new-age theme it can. For anyone looking for a serious film about a spiritual quest-- search elsewhere."
1,Sad But Typical Presentation,"If you're looking for an inspiring film of spiritual integrity, this is not it.It offers a very low, very Metaphysical skewed view of what most feel 'enlightenment' is.Go for ""Little Buddha"" instead and you won't be disapointed."
4,"Beautiful earrings, but much smaller than they appear!",I bought these thinking that they were larger and would dangle more. They are actually quite small but are still beautiful. Very delicate and understated.
1,Buy it somewhere beside Amazon,"This product is back ordered and is not even handled by Amazon. They turn the order over to Office Tech, supposely, a part of Office Depot. Amazon doesn't tell you that they take the cash from your credit card while Office Tech keeps telling you the order is coming sometime in the future. They say you can cancel your order but try to do it. The cancel button doesn't work and when you send an e-mail to cancel, the reply is your order will be ship sometime in the future. Then they tell you, you can return the order for a full refund."
2,Xtreme problem,"I use my Stanley Fat Max Extreme on a daily basis. I measure houses as part of my job room by room 2 to 3 a day, I purchased my Fat Max extreme Nov 2009 as of May 2011, The unit is no longer smooth on the return. It is easy to see in low light, the stand out is still about 12 feet. But the Fat Max it replaced had a lot longer life.The plus side the company does warrant the product, I have neaver had a problem with an exchange, but with this said, When your in the field and working you do not want to be caught short a tape.I always carry extra tapes in my car.My back up Fat max has been working for 5 years with out problems."
1,Poor quality product.,This tape was almost new when the end got caught in a crack between two boards. I pulled it out with some moderate force - not nearly enough to damage the tape - so I thought. The result was that the tape now automatically twists and collapses when extended making it totally useless as a normal carpenter tape measure. I believe the cause is poor-quality steel in the tape itself. I don't recommend this product.
1,I agree that they are poor quality tapes,"With limited use, my 35' FatMax didn't last two years before it broke at the 10"" mark. The tape was only used by me around the house and was not abused or misused. I won't be purchasing another one."
4,Hmmm. It works fine for me.,"I wonder what's going on with the reviews on this thing.I've had one of these 35 foot tapes for about 2 years. It's worked fine for me, and I actually like using it. I'm not a carpenter, so I don't use it every day, but I do use it enough that the case looks pretty worn.I would say it works as advertised. The blade stickout is the longest of any tape I own or have used. The hook is huge - actually too big for my taste. I opens fine, retracts fine, and I don't have any trouble with the button the numbers are easy to read.Negatives: The price for one. It's good, but I don't know if its that much better than everything else. Second, it's really big and heavy. Too big to carry on your toolbelt comfortably. I keep in in my toolbox, so it's not a problem for me.Based on function, I would probably give it five stars, but I'll knock it down one over the size and the price tag."
2,Blade Lock is almost useless,I don't use it every day so can't comment on durability but it's very annoying to have the tape lock come undone so easily. It doesn't really lock completely at all. Poorly designed.
3,Not What I Ordered,"This may seem nitpicky but the item pictured was not what I wanted to purchase. I was looking for the older model tapes (which are pictured) and not the current production of which I have several and all the springs tend to fail after short while. Both the Bostitch and the Stanley FatMax I've bought in the last 2 years have had quality issues. Also, the housing of the tape has gotten very bulky making them tough to work with when carrying everything on a tool belt. Time will tell how well these tapes work."
3,Has its flaws,"The tape is really good, strong and sturdy but it doesn't retract as well as I would expect it, sometimes you have to push the tape in to help it retract"
2,Stanley FatMax Tape,I received two of these for my sons. One of them lasted but the other broke the first week he had it. I bought them because they were suppose to be heavy duty for construction use. Couldn't return the bad one as that son lives out of state. Really disappointed in the quality.
1,Junk,"I have owned two of these. The first I figured was a lemon. The second confirmed that Stanley needs to rethink this product. Junk, junk, junk."
3,Better than a older versions?,"I have had the opportunity to see a powerbook upclose and personal and have witnessed it failing miserably. The Powerbook G3, looks sleek and seems to have alot, but apparently can't withstand a little bump. This was a new computer, however it the HD seems to have malfunctioned already. What's the beef? I thought Apples were supposed to be better than that."
1,"Awful, predictable dross - this book is just terrible","A fantastic premise, which is let down by a predictable story line, a patronizing narrator, swathes of cliche, an obsession with scatology, poor ubiquitous use of ellipsis and a moribund writing style that makes you feel like you could be doing something better like reading SuperSaver pamphlets. In a book slouching in on itself with tautological non-events punctuated by silly moments of (sexual) violence, the author is the master of the obvious; he lacks any form of humanity and with it any humor. It is rare that I have wanted to recycle or burn a book, and so I regret buying Blindness in electronic form. Avoid this old buffoon's witterings on the cruelty of humanity, and in the meantime spare yourself the feeling of having your precious free time and life being pried away from you in extra slow motion. If you want a superior read on a similar subject, I recommend you read Lord of the Flies."
5,Best Book of the Decade,Blindness is one of the best books I have ever read. I consider it at least the best novel of this decade.
5,The book of the decade,"I read this book a year ago and was so impressed I've since delved into all of his books, he is worthy of his Nobel prize for literature for this book alone."
1,How does a book like this win the Nobel Prize?,"How in God's name does a book like this win the Nobel Prize. The book would not have been a bad short story. It is way too long for what it has to say, contrived, steeped in skatology, and did not know how to end. Pass on this one."
1,Blind to grammar,"I have not read this book. So by no means should you take my review seriously. However I was unable to get past the first page of Blindness. The sentence structure was so irksome I couldn't conceive of reading a whole book written in that style. There were so many run-on sentences on that page I thought the use of periods had been lost in the translation. I know it's meant to lend a sense of surreal unsease, I know it's stream-of-consciousness. I just couldn't handle it. So keep my warning in mind if you're thinking of buying this for the book editor in your life. It'll drive them mad."
1,A Downer,"This is absolutely the most revolting book I have ever read. I have to admit, I didn't finish it. I could only get about 3/4 through it. If I want to be depressed, I don't need a book to do it for me."
3,Only the blind shall see?,"The author has an interesting premise but the story doesn't follow through on exploring where people began or how they ended up in their trips of temporary blindness. Even the events of what happens to the victims is uneven and seems incomplete, and in my mind, completely unbelievable. The care you might pony up for victims of this blindness never really reaches the point of satisfaction, especially with the way this novel ends. I almost feel some how the author couldn't figure out how to end the book so he chooses to circumvent it by ""turning on the lights"". A disappointment."
1,The Emperer has no clothes,"A poorly written book based on a fantastic concept: sudden, possibly contagious, ""white"" blindness amid a fascistic government environment.Unfortunately, the writing is appalling. It's not artistic, avante guarde, or fresh. It's distracting and irritating. If you found a copy of this book without its cover, you'd think you'd stumbled upon the writings of a junior high school student. In sum: the man needs an editor.If you're a fan of tragedies, you'll read this book continually thinking, ""What a great idea, how'd he screw it up so bad?""If you doubt my negative review, check 'Blindness' out from the library. You should be using it more anyway."
1,I didn't get the impression....,"I didn't get the impression that T. Burke (an earlier reviewer) would like the pedestrian writing in THE DA VINCI CODE simply because he disliked Saramago's BLINDNESS. It's allowed, isn't it? To dislike a book by someone who has won the Nobel Prize?I just find Saramago bewilderingly obvious, unsubtle and boring to read. He also supplies the wrong details. Not the ones that are really emotional, not the ones that really matter. And if students in my writing workshops tried to write like him I would definitely try to lure them away from doing so by suggesting better models: Virginia Woolf, Kafka, Conrad, Jane Austen, J. M. Coetzee, Hemingway, John Updike, Leonard Michaels, Vladimir Nabokov, and Evelyn Waugh, since they are much better stylists. And more complex thinkers as well. So is Colette. So is the extraordinary Sylvia Plath. So is the German woman who wrote A WOMAN IN BERLIN under the pen name Anonymous..."
1,I'll keep this brief,"The book starts off strong and loses steam in the middle. Maybe WAY before the middle. After they get all of these blind people together living in overcrowded and disgusting living conditions in a mental institution, it just got so boring. I guess they had to throw a sighted person in there so they could have some descriptive sexual content. I'm reading and thinking of how much more of this stuff I can suffer through? I'm finally giving up. A friend who who grew up in a communist country said it was her favorite book. I don't know how this could be anyone's favorite book. I finally looked up the author's bio and saw it was written by an athiest communist which isn't surprising. It's going to goodwill or the fireplace."
2,Not good ...,"Given all the rave reviews (which is partly why I read the book in the first place) I wanted to give a contrasting view. I found the style of the narative tiresome. There are not many paragraphs and you are left to work out who said what as the character's dialogues follow on from each other with little to distinguish them from each other. This you get used to. But it certainly didn't add to the reading experience. I thought there was very little humour in the book, and the sentences quite laborious. Maybe this is the fault of the translator. The idea behind the book is interesting. But I felt little really came out of it. There are glimpses of insight but this is not comprable to 1984, animal farm, or brave new world. But hey ... read it and make up your own mind."
2,Okay I get it there is poo everywhere,"This book drags quite a bit. Yes it has some great symbolism and yes ther is a deeper meaning, but seriously I got sick of hearing about how everyone is covered in poo. Worse yet, nothing really happens. I realize it is a book about ideas but it would be nice if there were more than three events. I konw he won the Nobel prize but if I were you I'd skip this one and read something by Dickens a real master."
3,blank white,"the books suffers from bad translation, questionable grammar, boring details and monotonic characters all strung together with what could have been an effective device: minimal punctuation.It seems the publisher worked very hard to destroy this book.If you like your bleak post apocalyptic literature well written then read Cormac McCarthy."
2,Verbose and disgusting,"I tried to get past the verbose nature of the prose, and fought to get past the first gang rape scene. I put the book down on the second. I wasn't expecting an uplifting book, but I've got better things to do than feel like vomiting during the few hours I can set aside to read."
3,interesting but not profound,"This book had an interesting premise and some great action. I enjoyed the growing suspense in the hospital as the ""Lord of the flies"" action played itself out. However, at the end of the novel I wasn't sure what the point of the book was. Good but not great."
5,Open your eyes!!,"Obviously, I won't give the plot of the book...nor will I discuss what Saramago actually intended to pass. I just know i read this book one year ago and i still recommend it vividly. It is disturbing, it is profound, it is absorbing... and it surely is not about blindness alone... let yourself grow by the hands of this genius!!"
4,The tale of blindness,Jose Saramago discribes a world much like we enhibit today. The tale of an epidemic of blindness has swept an urban setting captures the readers imagination and brings it into a new light. The book is written without any quotations and without any names which helps to show how much we associate with sight. This novel takes something that most of us take for granted away from us. You enter a world that is all told through discription but the charactors can only sense through their remaining four senses. Saramago's originality in the format for this novel is to be applauded. The plot begins with a man suddenly loosing his eye sight and from then on everyone he enconters or who the infected people see becomes blind within several hours. This story of humanity and at times inhumanity takes the reader on a journey through times of uncertainty as a human race.
4,Fascinating and creative story,"Clever premise that leads to a thought-provoking story of how society and relationships would collapse in the face of such a situation. It is difficult to read at times due to the punctuation, lack of quotation marks, and sparse paragraph breaks, but that just means the reader has to pay more attention. I did find it difficult to get into for that reason but ultimately the intriguing characters and increasingly horrible conditions kept me riveted and made it a worthwhile read."
3,Brutal and Peculiar,"Saramago's ""Blindness"" is an exceedingly dark and disturbing work of fiction. At times morbid, grotesque and savage, this work probes the darkest corners of a deranged, apocalyptic humanity. While overall a good, but not great book, ""Blindness"" tends to struggle with pacing (particularly pp. 160-200). For anyone familiar with similar ""tribal"" novels (""Lord of the Flies"", ""Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids""), the plot structure is somewhat predictable. However, the greatest disappointment is the self-indulgent treatment of certain scenes in the mental asylum--sadly gratuitous, overwrought scenes that a skilled editor would have excised. Certain subjects Saramago simply misunderstands. Yet, for all of its shortcomings, the novel does manage to have a satisfying ending that isn't absurdly postmodern. Also, the dialogue isn't all that hard to read once you get used to it.-Can't wait for the movie this fall!"
5,His best book,"A little different from his other works, I think, but its what makes it great. It is what the The Stand tried to be but couldn't. He gets at the very heart of how ugly and how heroic we can be in a way other books who attempted to address human behavior during crisis couldn't. The reason: he doesn't preach through his work and he's not cutesy; it is raw human nature where the good can be ugly without losing the heroic characteristic of the protagonist.He doesn't write to shock or throw you; it is a side effect and you get that so its not phony. If you only want to read one of his books (and i read most of them) this is it."
4,"An interesting, if incomplete vision","Saramago carefully weaves his vision of the world when humans lose one of their senses. Most of the passages in this book are dark and depressing, so if you are looking for a dramatic episode followed by an uplifting one, read something else. It is a horror story and a metaphor. My only qualm is that Saramago never mentions God in his characters' thoughts or in their actions, which is highly unlikely in a situation like that, whatever your belief system might be. It made the novel feel less real. Other than that, an engaging read. The last third of the book made it all the more worthwhile. Read it in Portuguese if you can."
4,Good,"This is a good book, but not as seminal as Camus's 'The Plague' and Saramago's own 'The Year in the death of Ricardo Reis'."
3,"Tense, taut, horrific.","""Blindness"" plunges into the greatest of fears...a dark humanity with little hope, love, or compassion. In this world of despair and helplessness, only the sighted doctor's wife can reinstate some purpose where none can be found amidst this diseased, inexplicable whiteness. Yet, I did not enjoy this book...quarter Science Fiction, three quarters Social Commentary. Though the prose proves suitable, it's nearly impossible to become engrossed in the painfully tedious sentences. (Don't even think about finishing this novel in one sitting.)"
2,"Over-rated, irritating to read","This was one giant metaphor, which would have been better suited to a short story, by an author obssessed by excrement (literally) and negligent of his punctuation. Concept is terrific - execution is dismal."
5,A modern classic,"Saramago's Blindness is not the easiest book to read, but few great books are. There is a deliberateness in everything Saramago does, his words, his punctuation, etc. This book makes the reader confront his own ""blindness"" (on a much smaller scale than the characters in the book experience) and question society. Saramago gently hints at a need for social change through the experiences of his characters, however it is by no means preach-y. Blindness is reminiscent of War of the Worlds and Lord of the Flies, a general end-of-days theme. But it is definitely an original is this category. Hands down, it is the best book I've read in the past couple of years. I highly recommend it."
3,overall worth the read,"It's been lauded as one of the best novels of the century; with that hype in tow, I was let down. It is a good but tenuous read. I say tenuous because of the style of writing- no paragraphs or quotations- it can be taxing on your nerves.The story itself is the movie ""Outbreak"". As the contagion spreads, the characters turn into ""Lord of the Flies"". It is very predictable. the story of an unraveled society has been done over and over.You will be saddened, you will be disenchanted with society and humankind, you will already be familiar with the theme. You will come away in a bad mood, and thanking God for your eyesight. But bottom line is, if any book affects you this much, as it did me, then it must be worth the read. It was."
4,Thought provoking!,"Our neighborhood book club read this book last month. Most rated the book a 4 or 5 but a few rated it a 2. The dark, horrible, frightening circumstances were a bit much for ladies who enjoyed book such as Alias Grace, Snow Falling on Cedars and Memoirs of a Geisha. If you are reviewing this for book club purposes, keep the audience in mind. During our discussion, the BIG question for all of us was, ""If this happened today, what kind of person do you think you would become; could you become a leader? We couldn't agree on whether the Dr's wife went blind at the end of the book or not. His writing was ambiguous."
2,Confusing,"I attempted to read this book to the best of my ability because the plot itself was very unique, and I was interested. However, the lack of proper grammar and no quotation marks... run-on sentences... abnormally long paragraphs... All of this turned me off, and I could not reach very far into this book. Although I am still very interested in the plot, but no rules of English writing seem to be followed, and I cannot therefore finish this book. As an English major, it drives me to distraction."
5,As Good As It Gets,"Blindness is problably one of the best books ever written. A mesmerazing tale with profound characters; an unusual literary style used only to maximize the novel's brilliant point of view from which it is told. Comparable only to masterpieces such as ""Lord of the Flies"" or ""1984"", this novel is more complete than the first one (because it is filled with horror AND beauty), and more intruiguing than the second one (because the building suspense increseases in every chapter, without overlooking witty comments and heart breaking descriptions)."
3,Not an easy book to read,"This was a fascinating story that felt a bit overdone. There were many times when the narration launched into a literary-style rambling sidepoint. This was often philosophical in nature, and extremely distracting.I was amazed at how quickly kindness, politeness, and basic civilization disintegrated into animal-like survival. Some of the actions and events that happened were horrible and disturbing.This is not an easy book to read. I almost stopped at one point because the scenes are depicted in stark, graphic and very detailed descriptions. Including a horrific rape and murder scene. Definitely not for the faint of heart. This was made into a movie in 2008, which was rated R. If books were rated, this would be an R as well.That being said, the story was intriguing and compelling. As the story progressed, I wasn't sure if I wanted it to end in a happy ending, or if it should keep up the dark feel and end tragically. I was satisfied with the ending, but not blown away."
5,Breathtaking in both its beauty and horror,"Jose Saramago shares Toni Morrison's ability to weave words into beautiful phrases that capture the tenderness and horror that define our existence. He shares Cormac McCarthy's skill in creating a gripping and horrific depiction of the depths to which people can sink when given the excuse. He has a way of describing a character that captures all of her nuances from the saintly to the selfish. These skills converge in Blindness to create a novel of such despair, horror, tenderness, love, and beauty that I was compelled to finish the book in one reading without putting it down."
4,surrealism isn't dead,"Ok, the book isn't punctuated as I know punctuation. It's a bit harder to get through than your favorite author. It has a couple of ""Why didn't he (she) do ..."" But the result is quite an acomplishment.I believe that the title of a book should relate to the subject matter in some way, and this example cannot be more accurate. It's about healthy people ripped of their vision and turned blind. Healthy people rendered handicaped, then average, then the human condition shows it's true face. At first, you might have to re-read sections to find out who said what (to me it's no different than becoming acquainted with an English film that has a dialect I'am not used to, after a few minutes, you get used to it and adjust). Often you want to know more about the character (whether blind or with sight) that the author doesn't divulge. Each and every character is interesting.Not for the everyone, but very effective writing. No real suprises here, but not very predictable either."
1,HORRID WRITING STYLE,"I think this might have been a great book if I could have adjusted to the writing style but I gave up trying. The writer ambles on in long, never ending sentences without using quotations. It was exhausting!"
2,a failed experiment,"All great artists have failed experiments. Unfortunately, this one was published ;). Not a bad novel, but in my opinion, Blindness falls far short of Saramago's other literary accomplishments. I respect him for going in different directions, but this one just never panned out for me. If you're a Saramago fan, give it a try, but if your looking for a starting point try Siege of Lisbon or the Jesus book. s."
1,Boring dialogue makes this a painful read,"Even if you can get past Saramango's complete lack of punctuation, you still won't be able to tell who is saying what because every character sounds exactly the same. They all talk like robots. No one has any personality, and it makes the book very dull.It could have been a great story..."
3,Would make a good thriller film,"The prose is daunting, because of the way sentences are linked by commas, as if they are long run-on sentences. Aside from that, the story is all plot, and would make a good thriller film. I had some problems with the plot: I would think that people in this situation would share their life stories or anecdotes with each other, but that never happens. Saramago keeps you reading if only to find out what happens next. I'd be interested to hear who you would cast as the doctor, his wife, the woman with dark glasses, etc. And who you would choose to direct the film. [...]"
2,Spend your money elsewhere,"The premise of this book was SO good (and this is the only reason it gets 2 stars) that I think I was even more disappointed when it turned out to be a really bad read. Amazon lets you read a few pages so take advantage of that!The author uses run on sentences that go on forever, and the only punctuation he seems to use is commas. And what REALLY bothered me was that he didn't give the characters real names, and when they were speaking it was terribly difficult to tell who was talking. I don't think he even used quotation marks for the dialogue. Very frustrating.But worst of all, the author is fixated on human excrement throughout the entire story. I almost stopped reading it a few times because of the unnecessary images he was displaying. It was very disturbing.If you are looking for a ""feel good"" novel, this is certainly the farthest from it. I was left feeling rather disgusted and did not find the end to justify that feeling. Skip it."
2,for acolytes of Gabriel Garcia Marquez,"""...but it is also true, if this brings her any consolation, that if, before every action, we were to begin weighing up the consequences, thinking about them in earnest, first the immediate consequences, then the probably, then the possible, then the imaginable ones, we should never move beyond the point where our first thought brought us to a halt.""Never felt myself particularly captivated by this particular novel. Nothing about it grabbed me and aside from the quote above, nothing about it really resonated with me. Perhaps it was the style -- the incredibly long paragraphs full of improbably long sentences, the dialogue interspersed throughout, Like so, different speakers connected by commas, Like so. Not as hyper-extended as Marquez, but that was the rub that I got."
5,excellent book,"As most of Saramago's books, this was too a very easy read, and with this I'm not saying that the book is simple. The story is about how human groups and individuals behave when faced to what seems to be an epidemic blindness, and how one person who is not blind has to deal with her condition, a condition that not necessarily means that is the best for her. The descriptions are clean and give abound material to the imagination. The narrative is very fluid. You will never get tired of reading this book. The end of the story couldn't be more elegant.Don't hesitate buying this book if you see it in a library. certainly, you won't be dissapointed.And please, if you're planning to watch the movie, do it but after you've read the book.Javier González-Cortés"
3,Blindness,"This book was repetitive, redundant, and repetitive. The content is not challenging - morally, intellectually, emotionally - as it presumes to be."
1,I hated this book!,"This book came highly recommended. The problem was not with the story line. My disappointment had to do with the squalidness (if that's a word) of the text. The narrator dwelt on the extreme filth that was a large part of the novel so that it was relentlessly depressing, with no redeeming features that I could find.I also had a major problem with the literary devices the author used: strange punctuation, no indication as to who was talking, nameless characters. It put a burden on the reader which I thought was unnecessary.Looking at the way the reviews lined up for and against this book, I guess you either loved it or you hated it. I hated it!"
5,"""Blindness."" Jose Saramago",Was the book that stepped up my game. He captures to bad and good when civilization breaks down. He could make a gangster weep.
4,"Other reviewers say it better, but . . .",". . . I want to register a good rating for this book anyway. It explores the baseness of human nature in an extreme situation. While horrifiying, it is believable, and that's why it's so shocking and so good. It's somewhat like a morality tale without being preachy. In fact, the author/narrator is quite aloof and objective, and the prose style is fitting with this manner: long, run-on paragraphs which are like streams of consciousness. Good reading."
3,A few contrary words...,"I agree with much of the praise that is lavished on this work and its Nobel-winning author. But....felt compelled to add a few mitigating words of criticism to these gushing reader reviews. Saramago's symbolism is powerful, but it is a long way from subtle, and at times I felt he was battering me over the head with Man's Blindness To His Fellow Man. Also, the story aims for a degree of realism--The Plague was clearly a (more successful) model--but yet here it never occurs to the main characters, a group of blind plague-sufferers led by an immune, seeing woman--to just hop in a car and just get the heck out of their stinking, ravaged, famished, hellishly plague-infested city...until almost the last page. And a final gripe: if I were blind, this novel would come close to offending me. Granted, the author is aiming for allegory, but the bottom premise of the tale--often explicitly stated--is that ""to be blind is to be dead."" OK, I'm done..."
3,About WEIRD.....,What a fascinating plot! What a new twist on an old survivor's tale! Sadly the author seemed caught up in the misery and helplessness of this created plot and couldn't move on. I think this would have made a riveting 200 page novel......sadly I never made it through.
2,"Overrated, not sure why","A friend swore to me by this book. Overall, it is an interesting premise and starts off interesting, but then degrades into over-indulgent descriptions of concentration-camp-like suffering that stretch for FAR too long. There are some good literary devices employed, and the style is worth noting, but overall it is nothing mind-blowing, and certainly repetitive for the seasoned reader who'd already encountered the hashed-out themes of human frailty, etc.Oh yeah, and the ending is stupid."
2,I could barely finish this book...,"I don't know what it was about this book, but after jumping right in and devouring the first few chapters (the concept was great, the writing was fabulous), I could barely make myself open this book to keep reading.OK I admit it. I skimmed through the last half of the book because I didn't feel right just leaving it unread and moving on to another book. And I wanted to see what happened (but I wanted to skip through the pages of muck and mire and human debauchery that made up most of this book).I guess what it came down to - for me - is this: how much rape and fecal matter can one person stand??? Because I felt like that's all I was reading about. Yeah, I get it, the human spirit prevails, etc. etc...but enough with the poop, semen and blood already!"
3,Good for book clubs,"This book was disturbing, even haunting. After setting up intense conflict and unexplained horror, it resolved with an inexplicable ending that wasn't much more satisfying than, ""and they all lived happily ever after."" Far from my favorite book. Nonetheless, it did spark some terrific conversation at my book club; our individual interpretations of what happened in the book and what it meant were wildly divergent."
4,Solid read,"I can honestly say that the book was more satisfying than the movie. At first, the dialogue was a bit awkward because it was not in quotes or separate paragraphs, but in a odd way it actually helps the book. The movie was lacking in the inner thoughts of the characters, and really, in this book, the inner thoughts actually help to fill in what the dialogue doesn't. If you found the movie difficult and plodding, don't discount the book - I promise you, the book has a lot that the movie doesn't. And if you DID enjoy the movie (I did enjoy certain parts of it) then you definitely should enjoy the book!"
3,stuck in the middle,"To say I was enthralled in the first 100 pages, would be an understatement. I really appreciate the Saramago's style of writing and have not come across many like him. However, at page 130, I am TIRED of them being in the psych hospital and feel as though the book in turning into Groundhog's Day.I am reading reviews of the book for inspiration to carry on, as Saramago started out so strong and KNOW that I will not regret finishing the book, but I'm STRUGGLING right now. I think I will have to read something else and return.Keeping the faith alive in Saramago though!!"
5,"""Hats off, gentlemen, a genius""","I never read anything that goes as deep into the human soul since Dostoievky's ""Karamazov Brothers"". Undoubtedly one of the great 20th century classics."
2,"Oh, Saramago...","Any decent editor would be appalled by the literary style of this book, if one can even call it a style. The narrative flips back and forth between past and present tense, the characters remain nameless (the main character is simply called ""the doctor's wife,"" others go by ""the girl with the dark glasses,"" or ""the wife of the first blind man""). Dialogue lacks quotation marks and is interlaced with the author's narrative, separated by commas, often making it impossible to determine who said what to whom. Other reviewers have commented that this is all Saramago's way of ""blinding"" the reader and immersing one in the story, but I have a simpler explanation: the only punctuation marks Saramago learned in school were the comma, period, and apostrophe.But even if you were to penetrate the broken prose, the plot is weak, ridden with filth, gore, lust, rape, and excrement.My recommendation for those considering this book is to look away and save time and money for some actual literature."
2,Not a necessary read,"I first became aware of this book from a reading list suggesting books college bound young adults must read. I thought I would read Blindness before giving it to my daughter and I'm glad I did. I saved her the slow realization that this book is predictable and, despite the author's best attempts to shock, boring. I tried to convince myself that the writing style added a certain weight and importance to the story and character development, but I soon gave in to my instincts that Saramago's faux stream of consciousnesses effort was a cover up for a cliched view of humanity. I don't even feel bad that I could not finish this book."
5,Disturbing and Haunting - one of the most frightening books ever,"I just wanted to put in a little review for this book I just read, Blindness. I could not believe how much this book affected me. While I read it, I was having nightmares, and I couldn't stop thinking about it. Not to give too much away, this book is a little slice of hell or a view into some kind of possible apocalypse - what might really happen if the world is inflicted with a pandemic.The good thing is that the book had a nice theme. It has lots, but the one that struck me most was the theme of interconnectedness. We don't think about it, but each person in society has a purpose, and we are all important - relying on each other more than we realize. I think that Blindness really highlighted this idea.I would recommend this book to someone who isn't afraid to read something harsh, someone who likes a good engrossing read that won't pull its punches."
3,Very very dense.,"I am a big fan of dystopian novels, so I was pretty excited to read this, but man oh man, this is a rough read just because of the format. The entire 300 page book is only like 20 paragraphs (okay, I'm exaggerating, but boy they were long and painful) and the author doesn't use any dialog-indicating punctuation. Dialog was embedded in the long paragraphs, often without indication of who is speaking, and speakers would switch mid-sentence. You could usually figure out who said what, but it was taxing. The book had a pretty interesting premise and kept up a good pace up for a while but it was about 100 pages too long, like a symphony that you keep thinking is over but drags on and on with themes and variations."
1,Bad translation,"It was clear that the book had undergone a translation, the writing seemed extremly clumsy and must have lost a great deal of its original charm. I think this really spoiled what might have been an interesting story, or maybe I am more biased towards writing style than a good story."
1,disappointing,"I read this book because it was choosen by my book club. I finished it because I felt I should. The premise seemed interesting but, would I recommend it? No! It did generate some conversation about characters action and reaction, but overall it seemed to be missing something for me.I'm told his other books have the same lack of punctuation...so much for the theory of the writing style "" makes you feel blind "".I see he has written a sequel called ""seeing"" ( I'm not kidding!) I wouldn't go there even if the book was free!"
2,A Philosophical Argument,"This book seemed like a college student's writing for a philosophy class.Too implausible! Where were the CDC's in their isolation suits?Why no music? One passage spoke of if only the Doctor could play a violin, even in the worst of times people sing.I just found this whole tedious book to be one long philosophical exercise. The contrived style of no quotation marks and identification of the speaker only added to my general ""big sigh"" reaction. No one had names? Oy Vey! I'm outta school and this book took me back to some of the more annoying people and teacher's who lived in their heads. Thumbs down on this one."
5,delivered as advertised,"Item came quickly, and in good condition as advertised. very good value for money :-)"
3,This book has its moments...,"This is really a great book, but it has its flaws. Saramago is a Nobel Prize winner, obviously a legend, but his language in this text really limited what he did with it. I was in awe at the profoundity of some of the passages, yet found some ridiculously monotonous and void of meaning. The ending was very abrupt, and did not do justice to the possibilities the book had. A moving story and interesting style (get used to no quotation marks!) make this a pretty good book, though I probably won't read it again."
3,there's more to humanity than misery,"Saramago's writing style is compelling, both he & his translator are/were(in case of Pontiero) craftsmen of a high order. Unfortunately I believe the book suffers from a flat imagination of what blindness (even sudden mass blindness) entails, and brings out all of the worst that human beings are capable of.The metaphor of our many blindnesses and the chronic ignorance that plagues our society only carried me so far in terms of willingness to endure extremes in human misery.I finished this book hungry for an uplifting view of humanity - something to counter-act the misery of the last few days of reading.I was also sorely disappointed by the ending which seemed to reflect the author's desire to stop showing us this world, rather than a well crafted story arc."
4,Interesting novel / concept,"Enjoyed the novel, in no way does the story knock the blind or say they are incapable...as protesters have been saying. In fact there is a part in the story where a blind individual who was blind prior to the incident proves to be most useful.The ending I feel was very lacking and incomplete. Like oh its all okay now."
3,The big picture,"No one comments on the most critical aspect of this fable: the big picture. An unexpected distaster strikes humanity; chaos and human degredation reigns; the existing authorities fail miserably; one person (a woman) after much equivocation takes action (after all she alone can see). What action? She summarily executes some for the hoped for benefit of the masses. Sounds like a forthright defense of totalarism, ie, fascism/nazism/stalinism. Remember the Kulaks, the Jews or the legions of ""enemies of the people""? Apparently not!"
4,Amazing allegory that resonates,"for a long time after the reader is finished with the book. It is one of those stories that allows each reader, religious or non-religious to bring her/his own personal philosophies and beliefs to interpreting the actions of the characters. I hope readers aren't scared off by the extensive violence in the book and focus on the deeper meanings. While I think the writer is absolutely brilliant and all the characters are believable etc... the translation felt a little weak to me. I am looking forward to reading some of his other books."
2,Disappointed,"The characters are flat, the dialog thin. The plot is interesting, but its presentation lacks the depth or subtlety that would make it engaging, or even at times credible."
3,fascinating concept,"I rushed out and bought Blindness after reading the first few pages on Amazon. Well it is definitely a different book... quite confusing, but the chaotic writing style lends itself to the plot. The narrative is so atypical and absorbing-- I flew through the first half of the book, and then it went awry. I think the initial page turning was due to the story's concept and not for the writer's ability. Intermittently I would go from thinking the book was profound and suspenseful to redundant and boring.Blindness is a good book, but it's not a great one... I would recommend The Road by Cormac McCarthy before this book."
5,Hurricane Katrina's unfortunate prophecy,"Sadly, as I watch the scenes unfolding in the Gulf Coast, I cannot help but recall this book which I read over two years ago. The accuracy of Saramago's vision of the breakdown of civilized society in the face of widespread tragedy is astounding. The evacuation shelters' deteriorating conditions, the growing anxiety of the victims, the escalating desperation leading to violence, rape and murder, the looting and bodies piling up in the streets. Sadly, not one writer's dissemination of ""masterbatory doom"", but playing out right now in the real world, for all of us to see. ""Blindness"" is being debated at this very moment, as the victims plead for help, and the authorities defend themselves and try their best to do their jobs at the same time. Remarkable book. Wish it was fiction."
3,I'd like to see a braille version,"Not a bad book, but perhaps not as good as the 'Nobel Prize for Literature' would lead you to believe. ""Blindness"" is a good balance of commentary on human nature and prose. Saramago's style uses only periods and commas, blending the voice of the narrator with that of the characters. It can be a bit distracting at first, but you soon get used to it, and appreciate it as a reflection of the way the characters hear each other. A little violent, a little post-apocalyptic, it's worth buying used."
1,Disguisting,When 70 people walked out of the 2008 film version screening and people walking out internationally on the film I wanted to read the book. Maybe the book was more than the film that critics everywhere was giving thumbs down. I found the book from the mastermind author behind the film version even more horrific. There are better literature avenues to describe human nature than his sadistic sexual prison fantasies.
3,"A Haunting, Disturbing Descent into Hell","Saramago's dystopian parable of an epidemic of blindness is both chilling and eerily plausible. Like Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"" the lesson is that civilization is only skin-deep, and that if any of the delicate prerequisites -- even sight -- is removed, the facade quickly collapses.Saramago purposely assigns no names to his characters or their locale, giving the story a mythic quality. However, their debasements are so total and so vividly depicted that this cannot be recommended to anyone with a weak stomach.Not a very cheerful or optimistic book; but one which may haunt you for a long time."
2,Blindness from my point of view,"I read the Kindle version of Blindness. At first I almost stopped reading because of the typographical errors. I found many small words capitalzed after a comma (not proper names). Also, I found many words with a space in the middle of the word. I would like to apply for a job at the place where this book was typed.The story was interesting as well as the characters. Sometimes the transition from one scene/place to another was not smooth enough to suit me. I had to read some pages twice in order to figure out which character was in that part of the book."
5,Still with me.....,"The premise of the book is appealing, though a bit scary. It makes you understand what happens when you are put into a position where those around you have extreme dependency on you. It further illustrates the frailty of humans who have been struck with a feeling/state of vulnerability. It is not about men or women--but about being human and the many experiences we have to endure and sympathise with. This is power and beauty and brutality and frailty and love and passion and fear and loathing. It is a quest through the unknown--something we will all empathise with. It is a winner. It appeals at many levels. It still sticks with me and I read it when it first came out. It is worthy of its praise."
3,Not as visceral as the movie,"I am reading this book after I have seen the movie of the same namesake. I am about halfway through it and am glad I got it from a friend and did not buy it. A Nobel Prize, I think not. For one, I certainly do not like the sentence structure. It seems written by a highschooler or college freshmen trying to sound clever, all without using punctuation; yes, there are no quotes in the book, anywhere. It's all run-on sentences. Sloppy, boring, and trite. As for the actual subject material, I found it much less engaging and tactile than the movie. I would recommend this only from the library or borrowed. But see the movie for sure; depressing indeed."
3,"Good, Not Blindingly Good, But Good","Who doesn't love a parable? But extended metaphor - like that of Saramago's ""Blindness"" - is tough, extended allegory even tougher; tough to write, tough to read, tough to interpret, especially when the author isn't handing out any clues to help with the under the surface stuff. Tough, when the reader lacks access to the writer's historical context.The result is an engaging but certainly flawed work, whose universal appeal is nonetheless understandable. We love it because we, the benighted, can make it, morph it, and otherwise pervert it to say just about anything we'd like it to. It's only my opinion, but when it comes to out and out allegory, that's a pretty big sin. Not unlike the blind leading the blind.Nonetheless, if you can find some charity in your heart, you have to admit that Saramago was just so good, even when he was bad."
5,"It won the Nobel for a reason, read it!","This book won the Nobel for good reason. The style is a bit challenging at first, but I quickly adjusted and fell under the authors spell. It's beautifully written, but also graphic and deeply disturbing. The story presents a wide range of responses to the epidemic, from selflessness to complete and utter cruelty, depicting a full picture of humanity. The epidemic of blindness serves as plight, metaphor, and measuring device for cruelty, survival, and kindness all at once."
3,Didn't have the stomach to finish this,"I really had every intention of enjoying this book, which had been recommended to me by several people. The first half kept me engaged and I was intrigued by Saramago's exploration of human nature. The basic premise is truly fascinating. However, by the time the gang-rape-of-blind-women-in-a-room-coated-in-human-fecal-matter scene came along, I just had to let the book go. For me, life seems too short to subject my imagination to such conjurings. Plus, I would have liked some exploration of the process of dehumanization that must have occurred in the hearts and minds of many of the characters. That might have made the gruesome scenes worth bearing. And, of course, I might have offered a different rating had I actually finished the book. Glad I didn't subject this one to my book club."
3,Too Cute,"If you have some spare hankys and you like to embellish with beads, lace and thread, this is a book for you. Each wallhanging requires 2-6 hankies and many of the author's designs include cutting the hankies. There are lots of color pictures and many embellishment ideas. The Hanky Panky method is well illustrated, but I'm not sure a beginner would be comfortable starting a project with the instruction provided in this book. Her advice on color and fabric selection are a bit skimpy. This book is good for this specific project; a hanky wallhanging. Not recommended if you're looking for a resource for a full size quilt or if you're attempting to create a wallhanging showcasing full/uncut hankies."
2,Coyote: A Trickster Tale from the American Southwest,"This was a fair tale children seemed to follow the story better but did not want to hear this book again and again,I was disappointed."
4,A playful and whimsical version of a classic tale,"My preschool-aged grandchildren loved this book that I had purchased from Amazon, particularly the illustrations with their vibrant colors and stylized characters. We had fun reading the book together. There was enough action in the storyline to hold their interest but yet nothing too scary for their young minds to visualize. Their Mother appreciated that! All in all, this book is a good one to share with the younger children in your family and a nice way to introduce them to the Coyote Trickster character."
3,"3.5 Stars - a review of ""Coyote: A Trickster of the American Southwest""","This is one of those books that I like but that my own two children --currently 6 and 8 years of age-- aren't getting into.Darn-it! I like it. The artwork is bright and quirky and funny, and I really like the tone that the author sets. It sounds like a fable, and unlike some fables and pseudo-fables that I have read, Gerald McDermott has managed to make a story that's interesting and that doesn't talk down to it's audience.Never-the-less, I have to voice my children's opinions and they weren't enthusiastic. Go figure. Perhaps they'll like it when they are older.The Accelerated Reading Level is given as 2.6.The Interest Level is said to be K thru 3rd Grade (although I do wonder if perhaps it might be wrong and the book might interest older children more.)Pam T~mom and reviewer at BooksforKids-Reviews"
4,Coyote wants to fly!,"My son ([...] years old) enjoys a lot this funny story about the silliness of the coyote and the tricky birds. We read it often and have a little song for the dancing of the craws.The design makes it easy for children eyes to understand the story without words.Another lovely book from Gerald McDermott, but not as good as Zomo The Rabbit or Papagayo. These are really great!!"

Perhaps they'll like it when they are older.The Accelerated Reading Level is given as 2.6.The Interest Level is said to be K thru 3rd Grade (although I do wonder if perhaps it might be wrong and the book might interest older children more.)Pam T~mom and reviewer at BooksforKids-Reviews.com"
3,Cute but not super fancy,"I wore this as a surprise for my husband at our wedding. He's an Auburn fan but I had to get my Roll Tide in! haha It's a cute garter but definitely nothing super fancy. It's not the greatest quality but since this wasn't my main garter, I was good with it."
5,At last! A golf book that will really help my game!,"This easy-to-read book helps you evaluate your own body, and target your weak spots. It's not filled with golf tips, but instead, is filled with tips on improving those body parts used in golf. I've been doing the recommended exercises for 2 weeks now, and I've already notice an improvement in my golf swing.This is smart, simple stuff that anyone can follow. Highly recommend!"
5,New Training for Service,"Invaluable Tool for new Christians. After following the lessons in order I felt like a seasoned Bible scholar.I could sytematically find Bible passages and verses. The Word of God was not just a literary collection of books, but an arrangement of Creator God's mind and will. Every new ""born again"" Christain should keep this book as an important refenece source forever."
2,Unsatisfactory Channel Display,"I bought TWO of these for Christmas gifts to Grandparents & will return both. Here's my beef:1. Sound is mono, not stereo2. The on-screen channel information is unreadable when the channels are changed. The digits are less than one inch in height and the white numerals are invisible on a light colored background.3. Picture quality and stability have room for improvement.4. Impossible to record one show and watch another (this is pretty much normal for TV/VCR sets however).Money would be much better spent on a higher quality model. RCA designers blew it on the display readout."
5,Excellant!,This book is a must read. Regan is a great author and I look forward to buying more books from him.
3,Titus Groan,"An intense read, similar to reading a Dickens novel. Characters are involved and unusual. Could this really be life in a cloistered castle?"
1,A cure for insomnia!,"This beyond any doubt one of the slowest paced books (as well as boring beyond belief) I have attempted to read. After 102 pages I have decided it is time to surrender. However, I think I will keep the book to read on those nights when I find it difficult to fall asleep."
2,"Well written, very hard going, is it worth it?","Unlike the other negative reviewers, I have read Titus Groan from cover to cover. It is lushly written; dark; brooding; but it is so incredibly boring. There are some fantastic characters, fascinating settings, and enormous potential; but the potential is never realised. Perhaps Peake intended this, given that the premise of the book is a society so trapped in tradition that it has not changed for generations. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy good descriptive writing. If you're looking for a good storyline, look elsewhere."
2,Groan is the word,"Well, after 115 pages of this literary equivalent of heavy molasses , with the odd glimmer of style thrown in once in a while, I had to quit. You wait for the tale to pick up, to get you interested, but you just end up not giving a damn about Gormenghast and its inhabitants. Detail is not enough to make a good story. Keep clear from this one, and spare yourself a bored *groan* upon putting it down. There is one positive aspect : you will expand your 1940's english."
1,Don't be fooled by the ratings.,After an hour and 40 minutes I had to shut the tape off. Seems as though the writer has forgotten that the plot is the most important piece of a book. Total torture. Goes nowhere. Dont do it and dont EVER compare this to Tolkien.
2,It gets absolutely no where,"I admit I never finished it, as I picked it up I thought it looked interesting but it never gets anywhere, and it is VERY boring, the characters seem stupid and if you are looking for an INTERESTING book I heartily recommend you look elsewhere."
5,Gormenghast Trilogy is in print in the UK,"I read and loved the Gormenghast trilogy many years ago, butlost my copies of all the books by lending them out to""friends."" I recently had a chance to go to the UK onbusiness and made a point of looking there for the Peakebooks. Surprise! They're all in print over there andhave been more or less continually. The copies I boughtare copyright 1989. Mandarin Paperbacks, an imprint ofReed Consumer Books Limited, 81 Fulham Road, London, SW36RB and Auckland, Melbourne, Singapore and Toronto.Reprinted in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 and 1994. There's alsoan edition that binds all three books together, but I foundthe large format with extra long text lines hard to read."
3,got patience?,"I do like this book. However, I don't think it should even be considered as being on par with Tolkien. It is descriptive writing at its best--Peake creates some incredibly gorgeous imagery, and if you like character studies...this would be a great book. It is however sorely lacking in plot development and in terms of themes etc it doesn't gives you much to consider. It's a rich book with a lot of icing but contains precious little cake."
5,2 great Power Stone gmes on one PSP Disc!!! Wow!!!,"This a great collection of two great 3 D fighter games(they are truly unique!),these games won a fan base with a now defunct game system,but now there back and portable on the PSP,with a few nice tweaks here and there!!! Great job from the folks at Capcom,they DO make some great fun games!!! Recommended for fans of the series,or people who like a good fighting game!!! A+"
4,Great Memories from Dreamcast,"This was an amazing game before and it still holds up to it's name. Power Stone, in my opinion this is like a 3D version of Smash Bros. and Tekken, the only down side is the loading times are incredibly long but it is well worth the wait. I would recommend this to newcomers to the Power Stone series and of course the Fans of this great title."
5,Power Stone is not dead yet! It lives on in your PSP.,"The sega dreamcast was an awesome system that was ahead of the game and gave us tons of memorable and awesome games like Shenmue, Marvel vs Capcom 2, Crazy Taxi and POWER STONE!!!!!!!!!!!! Power Stone is an inventive 3-D arena fighting game that allows you to choose from a colorful cast of characters and engage in fighting chaos with tons of weapons and of course POWER STONES! This game offers both Power Stone and Power Stone 2 along with tons of new extras not found on the dreamcast. Get this game and satisfy your thirst for chaos on the go.MYSPACE.COM/POWERSTONEALLIANCE"
5,the old school still rocks,I remeber this game from the dreamcast and it just as fun on the psp as it was back then on the dreamcast (Which I still think should still be around)
5,POWER STONE GOES PORTABLE!,"I received my PSP for Christmas and purchased the extra accesories the next day (e.g. the body armor and Media Manager program). I also got the chance to pick up this game and have enjoyed it since. After all, I absolutely LOVED the Dreamcast versions and wasn't in any way disappointed! This collection includes both Power Stone 1 & 2, which resembles the original game play, characters, and graphics--only smaller! You'll need to update your PSP to at least version 2.81 to play, but this is really no problem since it automatically does it for you (just make sure the battery is fully charged and that the PSP is plugged into a power outlet via the AC adaptor). The only downside I have with this game[s] is that the unlockable features (while good) are limited. Otherwise, for Power Stone fans, this is a must buy and at a very reasonable price!"
4,A Fun Experience Overall,"I've played Power Stone 2 on the Dreamcast before and it was a blast. Being able to play the game once more on my PSP is amazing. The game is the same as it was before along with its 2-player only predecessor, Power Stone. Both in my opinion are fun games to play when you feel like beating some virtual butt.The game comes with a few mini games that were released with Dreamcast versions of the games. They are fun to play and simple to understand so they make great time wasters. Gameplay for both of the games remain the same. You can unlock some characters from Power Stone to Power Stone 2 and vice versa. The game is a LOT and I mean a LOT of fun if you can find friends with it (it only supports ad-hoc). As such the game might get old for some if you play by yourself.All in all the two games are back and the same as before. If you want to relive those moments again or play the series for the very first time, this is where to start."
3,"Good series, Painful Controls","Over all this game is alright, graphics are definetly not all that stellar with some visual glitches here and there. The story and voice acting are still as good as previous installments. Gameplay is solid, though controls are a bit of a problem. Old button commands have been moved to twists and flicks on your wii mote. Twist your nunchuck to sneak across the wall or move it up or down for jumping. Camera is controled by moving the wii mote in the desired direction, and lockpicks are performed through twisting the wii mote to the proper position. Co-op makes a return in this instalment, and is fun as always with a buddy.Its a decent starting title for the Wii, but fans will miss their normal controlers."
4,Fun game!,I'm new to video games and found this game entertaining. I especially like the 2-player mode. It's really cool trying to figure out how to work together as a team while not getting spotted. Very pleased with purchase.
1,Based Mostly on Controls for the Wii,"Before any fans jump to any conclusions let me say the series is fun but the Wii controls are so bad that they nearly make the game unplayable. For example, in the second level in co-op one player needs to paint an automated machine gun with the electronics blocker on your pistol. Easy right? No because if you breathe the Wii remote will move off and the machine gun will fire and kill your partner.I like the Wii but after playing this game on it I would recommend renting games not specifically intended to be played on the Wii, otherwise the radical control format may seriously detract from an otherwise decent game."
2,"Controls are very poor. This could be a great game, but isn't.","Man. The Wii is very good for some things, but it appears that at least this PFS is not very good. The Wii remote is very jerky and sensitive. This makes aiming difficult to impossible. The graphics are OK. The storyline, is ok. It another Clancy sneek around and hope you don't get shot because you are going to die in very short order. I hope Call of Duty is better as I LOVE FPS games, but this one is lacking.The camera should not be allowed to go off screen, it should stop at the edge of the screen. Too many control issues to recommend. I will keep trying, but this game isn't so good that I will press on through the control problems just to get through it. I may have it up on eBay soon."
3,Good game. Slow pace,"This is a good game, I like the effects and action. I was kind of disappointed with the pace. The controls are somewhat confusing at first but once you get the hang of things you'll be alright."
3,Kind of a dissapointment,"I got this game looking forward to a great Tom Clancy game, but was quite disapointed. The controls are quite tricky and after playing it one time I have never played it again. The controls make it hard to sneak and fight at the same time. It looks like a great story but the controls are awfull. However, to defend them this game came out near the begining of the Wii's life so the controls were new, if Ubisoft rereleased the game with the controls and techniques that they know now I think this game would awsome!"
4,The story line is awesome bu t the writing could use some help!,"Let me just say that if you are looking for a fascinating uplifting read about a family who doesn't compromise their values, this is your book. You do have to get past a writing style which lacks vivid imagery and and has stilted transitions, but I was sucked in anyway after a few chapters. Just the idea that a man who is a strong Christian could join the German army as a pacifist, carry a fake wooden gun, and warn the Jews that the SS was coming the entire war and get nothing but promoted is enthralling.What an amazing family and what a sweet story of how God honors those who honor Him. I wish there were more stories like this one out there. I'd love to see Spielburg make this into a movie. It would rival Schlinder's List!"
5,A Thousand Shall Fall,Absolutelly wonderful book! I could not put it down. This soldier's faith is incredible and God's miracles taking care of that family warms up your heart. Highly recommend it!!!
5,Inspirational Reading,"This book is a very easy read. I had a hard time putting it down. The story was very inspirational and gave me hope in this crazy world. It was absolutely amazing what this family went through, how they survived and depended on God for EVERYTHING!I would highly recommend this book."
2,Strong 7th Day Adventist story-- negative Catholic comments,The story tells of God's reward for faith and trust in Him. But I didn't appreciate the gratuitous anti-Catholic comments.
3,a thousand shall fall,A must read book.... How a family in World war II practice thier beliefs against the nazi army and the husband(soldier) while serving in a ground unit at war.
4,From LA to Sac an open garage door,"Basement Wall was a Baton Rouge, LA, gumbo of '60's Zombies Yardbirds. They had regional hits, proto punk, "" Never Existed"", in the South East and were good enough to lay down these fun tracks. They are of a time, sincere and no fear!The other side of this CD is New Breed out of Sacramento, CA.,New Breed was the more important band. New Breed had a few local hits in the Bay Area that just skipped the Top 40. This CD has their local collectable hits ""Green Eyed Woman"" ""Want Ad Reader"". New Breed morphed into Glad, releaded an LP, then into Redwing on Fantasy trying to be the latter day Creedence. Didn't work out well. But, Tim Schimdt, the guitarist and lead vocal, went on to Eagles and apparently had a fine career... !!This CD is fun for archaeology(PS I have New Breed/ Glad/ Redwing history more posters etclet me know if you care!)"
3,A bit too poppy!!,"This is a Gene Loves Jezebel album the record co. wanted people to buy. It is good, but a bit too poppy, compared to their other albums. The songs still have good guitar riffs and it sounds like GLJ, but not as good or as bizarre. It is a good album for people who want to listen to GLJ for the first time."
2,punter,"This was Bobby's only visit to Australia and I am sure the backing band was Johnny O'Keefe's Dee Jays. He was a big star in Aussie with ""Shout"", had a bad car accident & later a problem with drugs, very sad. It was very ""hammy""as Aussies would say. But it is like everything Bobby, we have to have it all from the earliest days."
5,Ryobi 7.2V Battery,"Although the new battery is exactly the same quality and type as my original, after using both batteries concurrently for two large projects, I realized that I needed an even more powerful drill with greater voltage and turning capacity. I will however, continue using both batteries with my Ryobi drill until I've decided to purchase a stronger device. I've found it most convenient to have an extra battery in the charger. I may be a good candidate for an impact drill? What do you think?"
4,A 4-Stage Process that really works,"Apparently this book is getting a lot of attention in the coaching world. My coach recommended I read it and that we incorporate some of the steps into our ongoing process. I am finding it be an enthralling read. My biggest problem has been slowing down enough to absorb her questions and apply them to my situation. I am going back through it for the second time to focus on the exercises. I suspect this is a book I will return to again and again, to keep myself ""authentic"".This is a good buy for those who want to get out of their current personal or professional rut. Cuts quickly to the heart of what is holding us back. An excellent, thought-provoking book for coaches who are looking for a way to enhance their own process."
1,More of the same,"Over-written and far from original, this book promises more than it delivers. While the journey of self-discovery is hard work, reading a book should not be. Perhaps, for professionals who define themselves and their ""authenticity"" by title, position and acceptance in a workplace, this might be a helpful read. However, for true and lasting help in defining one's self, one's position and furthering one's prospects, a better read would be Dr. John Maxwell's Thinking for a Change."
1,dog-off ultrasonic dog trainer,"i purchased a dog off ultrasonic dog trainer.i have now returned it as it is useless, i have tried the dog off button on a total of 27 dogs and not one of them gave any reaction too the so called ultrasonic waves.i then asked my local dog trainer what he thought of it, he said the idea is good but this product is not"
1,Does it help? Will it fall apart before you use it?,"First of all, the strap and belt holder parts fall off. Next, the switch to turn on the flashlight goes defunct and drops into the unit so you can only turn it on with a fingernail or object. I've had it maybe 5 months.Does it scare off loose dogs? I don't know because they seem to ignore it totally. I think it's not nearly strong enough. It certainly isn't sturdy enough to withstand being carried around!Plus it's bulky/big and isn't small like a cell phone or other device to carry."
4,Dog-Off..........how about Siren-Off (or not).,"Our sweet but stubborn lab barks loudly anytime she hears a door open or worse, anytime she thinks she hears a door open or when she thinks that somebody might be about to open a door or sometimes when she is just thinking about anything that resembles a door or reminds her, however remotely, of a door knob. This little device worked perfectly on our dear Daisy May--a quick press of the magic button and she stopped barking--until it broke. The extremely audible human deterring panic siren went on for some unknown reason and wouldn't turn off. The darn dog started barking again and never stopped. Today, I will order another one (a Dog-Off, not a dog)."
3,Kind of sorta works,"My mother is afraid of dogs so she rarely jogs outside ... I bought this for her, but it doesn't seem to work as well as advertised ... we never use it since it is large and really no use."
3,Great...until it broke after 3 weeks,"I had a problem similar to Rick in Arizona (below). This product worked great to stop my dog from jumping up, getting into the garbage, etc. However, the cat knocked it off the counter--not much of a fall, but it caused that God-forsaken, eardrum-splitting panic alarm to go off non-stop. I tried to take the whole contraption apart, but there was no way to fix it--the only way to get the alarm to go off was to take out the battery. Had to throw it in the garbage."
1,Pain,I installed the battery and then pressed the button that is suppose to help repel a dog or get him/her to stop barking. I immediately got a terrible pain in both ears and then got an awful headache. I rarely get headaches so was surprised to get one so quickly right after I pushed the button. Now I am afraid to use the Dog-Off since I do not want to have that pain again. It is now 30 minutes later and my ears are still in terrible pain.
2,too many bells and whistles,"I was looking for a sonic dog training device and this thing has so many features I didn't seek out, none of the features then I dropped it and the siren alarm wouldn't stop, carry the device. It has a belt clip and a lainer , but while wearing it I lost the battery cover, duct tape only went so far. I need another, but will not be buying this brand again"
4,Dog Repellant,"We had one of these that gives my disabled husband a great sense of security when walking our Boykin Spaniel in the neighborhood. After being dropped numerous times the battery cover was lost. I was SO happy to be able to replace it quickly. It definitely gets the attention of dogs that are bothersome and they back right away. We hate that our dog's ears get hurt too, but safety first!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't buy this. Had no luck with this at all. I ended up throwing this away. Not worth buying, select something else."
1,Very very bad product,I have bought this product and its not worth any cent i have paid for because none of my dogs reacted to it they seem like they here something but they do NOTHING and only a few cats responded to it so please do not buy it find some other brand.
1,Disappointing!,"My dog trainer recommended this product to help train my puppy. It worked for 1 day, after that she became immune to the ultra sonic sound. Not a good training device."
2,Dog off trainer?????,Doesn't work on my dogs (dachshunds) even though my friends with dachshunds ranted how great it was. No clear instructions on how to use - so I just pointed it and pressed when they were barking excessively - no response at all. Probably try to resell it to get some of my money back. So back to yelling at them to SHUT UP!
2,boy ow boy !!!!,Man Carolyn Keene what were you thinking??? I love to read these books but Nancy doesn`t see the Hardy brothers until the end.I skipped 50 pages because of this.And get rid of the billionare.And whats up with Nancy and Frank??? Tell them to dump Ned and Callie.
2,"Not my favorite, but it will pass",This book was a total disappointment they didn't even meet up till the end of the book and it didn't have that muchaction either. It was not that super at all
2,BORING!,"This was like the worst nancy drew and hardy boy book. I agree. They didnt meet until the very end and one of my favorite parts is when they meet. And, come on, Romance between Nancy Drew and that millionaire? He seemed like 32 right? And the whole plot was kind of dumb. I couldnt follow that well. Sorry Ms. Keene."
1,YUCK!!!,"This book wasn't too bad, but it's definitely the worst one I've ever read, especially for this awesome series!! First of all, it was very confusing and slow. The Hardys meet Nancy much later than normal. Also, it was probably only written to get money from Titanic movie lovers. The only good thing about this book was that it's better than the movie."
3,ok not a favorite,Not enough suspense. It wasn;t as good because they didn't even meet till the end of the book. I shouln't critize Ms.Keene though just for this book.The last several books haven't been as good as normal
5,This book really is TITANIC!!!!!!!!!,"This book is awesome, though it seems to me more than just a coincidence that it came out while TITANIC is ruling the movie theaters. Anway, the mystery is great. The ending is a total surprise. I never saw it coming. Nancy sees someone getting shot and killed while working on a mystery, but Frank and Joe accidentally stumble into a major one, too. One thing I would reccommend, though, is get Nancy and the Hardys together earlier on in the book. They don't get together till about 3/4 of the way through. Otherwise, this book was excellent!"
2,Not the best,"This book had a lot of action. It was pretty good in that department, but Nancy and the Hardy Boys are suppose to be together. If you want to see a lot with them together, this isn't the book for you. They don't actually meet up till the very end of the book, and then they don't even solve it together. I was dissapointed. There are better books out there to start with. I've been reading the Hardy Boys books and Nancy Drew books for ages. There are much better ones out there. Good luck!"
2,skip it !!!!,It or they need to get it together.Nine words: they meat at the end and the millionare EXIT!!!!! And when are Nancy and Frank going to leave Ned and Callie???Their perfect for each other. Even more perfect then Nancy is with Ned and Frank is with Callie.
3,"OK, but not a strong plot","This book was OK, but I did not understand the mystery or crime until the middle of the book. I think the plot was a little bit weak, because I don't think the United States plans to ever raise the Titanic. The story goes like this: Nancy Drew is on a mission to discover the plot behind a scam selling tickets to see the raising of the Titanic. While on the hunt for the main seller, she witnesses him get murdered. This book is basically trying to find out who murdered him and why. Frank and Joe Hardy are on a pleasure vacation until they get mixed up in the same case that Nancy is involved with. The characters were very vague."
2,not really inspiring,"Unfortunately Kockelman's book turned out to be a encyclopedic summary of Husserlian phenomenology, and as such much poorer and less illuminative than the Brittanica article of Husserl's which was similar in aim, and which is the movement point for this book. Students of some intelligence need books that are really engaging and developing, and not just encyclopedic knowledge. Of course by reading this sort of a book we may learn definitions of concepts like noema and noemata, but I believe we would better have no idea of a subject than having a junk of poor and lifeless concepts. I would recommend the reader, especially the more sophisticated and good-willed one, to turn to Husserl's own numerous introductions like Cartesian Meditations or the Crisis even if he does not know much phenomenology, and put some sweat into them. Still this book might be helpful with some undergraduate exams- to'fill in' papers."
2,I'm sorry to say this but this product is not worth it.,"This product is just not worth the money. Its from an unknown company. The pictures are really bad. You cant take an unblurred picture unless the flash is on. MP3 player on this thing is pretty cool until you have to turn it off to save battery. When you turn it back on the Mp3's dissapear! This product was an absolute waste of money. This is like a quicky cam. Do yourself a favor and buy from a KNOWN company like fuji, kodak, etc."
5,Medium-Large Sauteuse--Good Buy,"This Calphalon Professional Hard Anodized 4-Quart Sauteuse with Lid is excellent for braising meats, poultry, and vegetables. However, one needs to have a large cook top with a large burner available in order to get the best results because the base on this shallow pan has a large diameter. At a medium-high setting, using an oil with a high smoke point (e.g., grape seed or canola oil, not olive oil), this sauteuese works well for searing, browning, braising, frying, and sautéing. Then the same pan can be used in a preheated oven for roasting. I like to add rice, noodles, or couscous to the roasted meat or poultry and vegetables, so that I can use the same pan for serving family-style at the table. This pan is almost nonstick, and any stains or sticky residue can be removed with Bon Ami, Soft Scrub, or Dormond cleaner when hand-washing the pan."
1,Not What I Expected,"I received this pan..., I returned it... This pan was not what I expected. The pan is very thin, the lid doesn't weigh much more than several paper plates. The lesson I learned is to try to find cookware in a local store, inspect it, then if cheaper order on line. The only problem with this idea is that this pan was not available locally. I wouldn't suggest this piece to anyone.... If the price was [cheaper] it might be worth it. Don't think you are getting a great bargain, like I did, when you look at the regular price. It is a bargain pot at an inflated price."
4,"Good, but..","I love the Calphalon Hard Anodized cookware, however, both the handles on the sides of the pot and the handle on the lid get as hot as the pot itself. This is not like the other pieces that I use. Several burnt fingers later, I am learning, but it is a little difficult when using several Calphalon pots on the stove and I don't always remember to use a pot holder with this one!!"
3,"Good, but keep looking","London Lounge has some great stuff on it (Troublemakers, etc), but in my opinion it doesn't hold up to the Paris Lounge(s) and Berlin Lounge discs. I'd recommend checking those out before the London one, unless you have some special reason for digging on London."
5,"BETTER LOOK OUT, PARIS LOUNGE!!!","""London Lounge"" is an excellent companion CD to the famous ""Paris Lounge"" series on the Wagram Records label. With incredible songs from virtual unknowns like Taxi, Gwyn Jay Allen, Nicole Wilson, Moloko, Smith and Mighty, Richie Thomas, Count Indigo and Two Banks of Four and a few knowns such as Herbaliser, The Cinematic Orchestra, Aim, Rae & Christian, Herbert, DJ Food, Mister Scruff and Subway, ""London Lounge"" unfolds into a cornecopia of very satisfying downtempo (""London by Day"") and uptempo grooves (""London by Night"")! Nothing here sounds generic or unnecessary. I played this one at a gathering of friends the other night and they couldn't sit down, even with the ""Day"" side playing. I must say that the ""Paris Lounge"" series (and ""Berlin Lounge"") pales a little in comparison to the ""London Lounge"". L.L. cost me a pretty penny, but the good thing about Wagram Records is at least you know you haven't heard a lot of the material they put together on their CDs."
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Acid Jazz and Lounge muic, however this CD did not meet my expectations at all. Since some of the best lounge music comes from places like London, Paris, Rio, and Tokyo, I was anticipating that this would be an awesome mix of songs. I would say out of the entire 2-disc album, there were only a few songs that were worthwhile to listen to. ""From A Seaside Town"", ""Blacker"" and ""Shrimp"" were pretty decent songs. If you like lounge music or if you are trying to get a good introduction to it, there are many other albums that are much better."
2,"""Not"" lounge","I bought this disk set after thoroughly LOVING the ""Paris Lounge"" sets, and thought this one would HAVE to be just as good. I was wrong. Sure, there are some good, ""essentials"" from Thievery Corporation and Thunderball, but most music listeners interested in this genre already have those tracks. If you don't, do yourself a favor and pick up some ESL compilations like ""Den of Thieves,"" or ""Modular Systems."" They represent the best electronic lounge music available.As for ""New York Lounge,"" unlike its Parisian-predecessors, its not lounge music. Instead, its a compilation of well produced, but musically mediocre R&B. Even the track by Miss Kittin (again.. not lounge, but at least cool) gets boring, with ""Bill-Cosby as a pimp"" style voice-over.I haven't heard any others in this series yet, (Berlin, etc...) but I KNOW (because I live there!) that New York has better than this to offer."
2,Do not buy!,I have had three Sony Watchman TV's before I purchased this one. The new RCA had the worst reception out of all of them. I gave this TV to my son and bought a Sony.
1,Did not work,The item turned but that was it. Nothing more happened. Tried 3 different antennas and 4 different locations. Nothing happened.
1,A Thriller For Kids,When I ordered this product I thought I was ordering a CD and not an album.I received an album and am VERY disappointed! I already have the album.
4,LOVE these glasses!,"GREAT quality for the price. They look great on the table, sound pretty when clinked together for a toast. Unparalleled value."
4,Great price,Replaced a glass that was bought at Crate and Barrel. Much cheaper and exact same glass.
2,"If You Are Replacing, These May Be Taller","I originally purchased a full set of these glasses in 1991 (in a department store). Due to breakage over time I needed to buy four more here.Even though they are the same glass, the new ones I purchased are slightly taller than the old ones. I would have preferred them to be the same height as the originals or to have been informed that the height had changed.All other aspects of the new glasses are the same as my originals."
5,"Simple Elegance Anytime, Anywhere.","I've been eying these glasses for a long time, but couldn't justify the purchase until recently. I had a set of heavy crystal Mikasa wine glasses that were quite handsome, but as I said, heavy. Recently diagnosed with Arthritis in the thumbs and wrist, I used that excuse to purchase these beauties. Gave the Mikasas to younger friends and we're both happy. These glasses are exactly what I've wanted - light enough, but sturdy enough for daily use. And they do get used - daily!They were packed carefully and the shipment arrived on time and in perfect condition. No complaints, here."
2,Disappointment,"After ""The Stone Diaries"" this story is a true disappointment. Slow, miniaturistic, shallow. ""The Stone Diaries"" on the other hand was one of the best books I ever came across."
3,A decent read,"I thought the book was not in the same league as Stone Diaries. It was a nice love story with a happy, predictable ending. Perfect for a weekend read."
2,very tiny,"not at all painted well, these seem blurry and ill cut. you can hardly tell what they are. Paint job terrible"
5,This Is A Must-Have Book About Spies & Spying,"What an amazing and compelling book about spies and spying throughout history--in literature, entertainment , and fact. This is a must-have treasure especially for all spy movie fans, and anyone else interested or fascinated by why spy?, what makes a spy, how to be a spy, and who has created the spies you know and love."
3,a pleasant listening experience,I heard an excerpt on the classical radio station and wanted to hear more and ordered the CD. Interesting sound!
4,Best PS2 Stand!,"This is a space saving accesory that holds your PS2 vertically, the stand also has room to hold ten games or dvds. The only problem is the game holders are on opposite sides so youll have turn your PS2 around if you want to play a game you put on the opposite side, otherwise its a very useful accesory, and it's at a great price. If you want a stand for your PS2 get this one."
1,ruins games!!,do not buy this not worth it sure it saves space but when you use games it will scratch them so if you need more space you are better off just making it rather than buying it
1,The Mission at it's lowest point,"Cash, that's probably the only reason for this release. More and more bad remixes and bad rerecordings of old songs. And some b-sides that the real fans already have and of course one new song.The magic has been killed. Great songs been transferred into nothing more than songs I am ashamed of owning.If you are a fan, if you want to have everything the mission put out, buy. If not. Don't."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Not that it matters a whole lot, but the amp I received doesn't exactly resemble the photo.The good:It's cheaply priced and was shipped very promptly with tracking information provided. It also came with a guitar chord which wasn't mentioned in the description. Parents will probably love this amp for their kids. It does what it's supposed to do. A young beginner will probably be very happy with this amp.The bad:The sound. Not the best sound quality. But then again what can you expect for 40 bucks.The ugly:My decision to worry about saving 20 bucks by buying this amp instead of a Fender Frontman 15 watt amp. But that's my fault, not Austin Bazaar's.Conclusion:If you're looking for a small amp for your kid's first guitar, this is probably a decent option. But if your looking for a small practice amp with decent sound, this might not be your best choice."
1,Not the Real Deal,"My original toy fart machine broke after many years of fun and pranks. I found this replacement on Amazon for a reasonable price but what I got was not the original at all. The original had 5 different sounds that sounded real. This cheap imitation has 2 sounds, just a fuzzy noise. Made in China, just a cheap imitation. Junk!"
4,whoopee cushion,the product is being used to play with our cats. It arrived timely and as advertised.
3,Worth buying,"I discovered Bif while watching a somewhat obscure channel called Much Music, which is kind of the way MTV was before it was ruined. The channel showed the video for ""Spaceman,"" and I was hooked! Luckily the CD is now available in the U.S., and perhaps in a few months mainstream radio will discover it and play it to death to the point where we all hate it. I'd say about half the CD is really strong, and the other half pretty average or forgettable (in short, a pretty typical CD). When I hear the song ""Spaceman,"" I am reminded of Babylon Zoo's masterful 1996 single of the same title, not simply because of the name but also because the two sound vaguely similar."
3,Belinda Carlisle with tattoos,"Her image is calculatingly edgy, but face it, if you never saw a photo of Bif you would think that her music belonged on your local pop station. Everything on her handwritten liner notes screams ""Look at me! See how unconventional I am!"" Alas, her music, the actual product, is fairly pedestrian. And hey, nobody says Gwen Stefani is ""just like Bif""... A good album, but not exactly the salvation of rock and roll."
5,Bif ROCKS!,"It's great! This CD has gotten me addicted to Bif! I totally recommend this CD for EVERYBODY, epscially no doubt fans! RoCk On BiFfY!"
4,luckyme,"i LOVE the song ""lucky"", i first heard it on buffy the vampire slayer! I knew i would like her other songs too, becouse i like her style! if you like this song, i recommend: no doubt or try a new cd: kari wuhrer's ""shiny"""
5,"D'accord, bro.","Right on, brother, buyers should know there are the two different CDs, both good, I prefer the American CD if only for the better version of Spaceman. Also noteworthy -- the liner notes with the American CD were heavily censored with black pen to hide the naughty bits -- so you need the Canadian CD to read the notes in full."
5,This is a great cd,I loooooove this cd because shes totally honest and real and the liner notes are great also. Her voice is great. I hope she puts out another cd soon. Im not gonna review every song but I highly reccomend this cd :o)
5,A Complete Impression,"From ""Moment of Truth"" to ""Lucky"" Bif Naked exemplifies every possible genre. Bif Naked is vivacious, sultry, Respectable and extremely attractive not to mention her impressive talent. Her range compliments every song and leaves you wondering if there is anything she can't do. I have been listening to Bif Naked for three years now and I believe there isn't. Upon hearing ""I bificuc"" I didn't think there was much more left to accomplished but I was proven wrong when I brought ""Purge"". Needless to say I was not disappointed. I would recommend any one of the serveral albums, reguardless of what style of music captivates you. There is something for everyone. If her looks don't stimulate you the music surely will. The only aspect left is a live show! WHEN WILL BIF NAKED TOUR IN NEW JERSEY?"
4,Very good!,I was very impressed by this cd....i didn't think it would be that good but when i listened to all of it I was amazed. She is very talented. It sounds a lot like No Doubt's Cd.
5,Bif Naked....Get It!,"Get It! This CD is totally worth of what you pay for it(unlike the Kid Rock CD!). I first saw the video for ""Moment Of Weakness"" on the MTV show webRIOT and figured there would be like 4 songs that would be good...EVERY SONG KIX ON THIS CD! I also suggest other CD's like ""Make Yourself"" by Incubus, ""System Of A Down"" by (you guessed it!) System Of A Down, ""Enema Of The State"" by Blink 182, ""Dysfunction"" by Staind, and ""The Battle Of Los Angeles"" by Rage Against The Machine."
3,"i think bif is really cool, but i only like one of her songs","i think bif rocks, i love her music video and her tattoos. but i really dont like girl singers that much. not that there is anything wrong with then but i like hard rock and girls voices just dont sound good singing rock, i do think that bifs song"" moment of weakness"" is really good. love hana ps no offence"
1,Can you say copycat?,"By now I'm sure you've heard Bif Naked's song, ""Moment of Weakness."" Let me throw this at you: Have you ever heard of the band No Doubt? You know, ""Don't Speak"" and ""Spiderwebs. Well, let's just leave it at that Bif Naked is one heck of a spin-off. Her music style is so similar to that of Gwen Stefani's it sickens me. If you are stupid enough to enjoy Bif Naked's music, do yourself a HUGE favor and buy the No Doubt CD, ""Tragic Kingdom."" The lyrics are meaningful, the singer has more talent, and it is a much better buy. Bif Naked is the classic example of a non-American attempting to copy an American band's sound, and hoping to be successful. Let's hope that Bif Naked is not."
1,"GAG ME, PLEASE!!!","Bif Naked. Hmmm, maybe 4 people have heard of her. God, she is so talentless it repulses me. In the year 2100, when people are discussing the truly great musical wonders of the past 500 years Beethoven, Bach, Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles, Madonna, Prince, Tina Turner, Mozart, Stevie Wonder will come to mind, BUT DEFINITELY NOT BIF NAKED! Save yourself and DO NOT BUY THIS REPULSIVE CD!!!!!!!!"
3,"silly in most parts, interesting in few","A novel involving a world of fashion, it was a great idea. However, I was slightly disappointed. I thought that it was silly to have an antagonist who threw his manhood in womens' faces throughout the book. Then an unjustified marraige proposal that was developed from a simple father and daughter-like relationship, how did that happen? I also hated how the novel ended. It was a poorly rushed and lame wrap-up. There were some things that I did like about this book. Going back to the father and daughter-like relationship between Jacque and Jordan, I found thier conversations together enjoyable. Also, the lesbian love scene was the first I have ever read. At first I felt akward and almost embarrassed to be reading those few pages. Then I just sat back and went with the flow. It was quite a read.Overall, I thought that this book had the right formula, but mixed it all wrong."
4,surprised me,Slow going at first. It took me awhile to find some sort of resonance but still a good read. Phenomenal ending.
4,Nice Protection,I bought this to protect the screen on my psp slim......nice shield and it's washable to be used again and again.
1,Paperback BoxCar Children,"I was disappointed. I wanted only hardback copies, and I did not see where this said paperback.My loss, will have to be more careful in the future.The series is good for children's reading.Thank you,S. A. Henry"
2,Kindle Version Warning,"I purchased the Kindle version of this because our local library did not have a hard copy to borrow. My children and I have been disappointed to discover the Kindle version has missing content. Every few chapters, there is an obvious ""jump"" where material is missing. Reading this book has turned into an exercise in deductive reasoning for us trying to figure out what happened in the missing sections. If at all possible, buy (or borrow)a hard copy of this instead of purchasing the Kindle version."
2,Basement Wall Live,"I actually saw these guys live around 1966. They were incredible. Unfortunately this CD is not a very good representation of their talent. The sound seems like it was done from mikes around a bar and not from a sound board. You hear background noise and glasses tinking. The audience applauds very little. If you are a real fan, then buy it for sentimental reasons."
4,Great for the money,"Great machine for the money - plus free shipping. went together very easily, but pay attention to the pictures, not the part labels since they're wrong. Lots of power, but loud, typical of these kinds of machines. belt tracks true. disk seems to have fine tolerances. best for hobbyists and home shops."
4,"Reasonable price, medium quality.",Pros: Easy to assemble.Easy to adjust belt.Easy to switch from horizontal to verticalGood value for the price.Cons: It is very loud.Arrived damaged: Plastic guard was broken and metal support at head pulley was bent. I was able to bend metal back in shape and epoxy the plastic guard. UPS is not real careful handling parcels and Delta could spend one more dollar on better packaging.Mike
2,Well it lasted a few years,"I bought this sander a few years ago, and was reasonably happy with it. It did not get heavy or continuous use, it was primarily just for hobby work. The motor burned out for seemingly no reason, this sander was never abused, not did it have that many hours of use, even though I had it for about 3 years. There's just no excuse for the motor to fail, other than poor quality from the manufacturer."
2,2 bad motors,"First motor was under warranty and it was replaced, but I had to carry it to the repair shop which was 30 miles from my shop. Next motor lasted 13 months and it burned out, plus the capacitor burned up and 2 bearings were worn to the point of needing replacing. I think it was good that Black & Decker bought Delta Tools maybe they will improve the quality of the tools."
3,Delta Belt and Disk Sander 31-695,"I have several Delta products but this one has my lowest rating. While attaching the base to the stand, one of the attachment point cracked while bolting it to the legs. I called Delta to complain about the poor workmanship and they said they would replace the base. I said I needed to back charge them for dismantling and reconstructing this machine because it was new. While dismantling the machine you will have to disconnect the power cord from the transformer in order to remove it from the base. I should have known, Made in China."
4,So Far So Good.,"Item was recieved in a timely fashion at the estimated arrival time. Although due to the winter season it has seen very limited use, it has performed as expected. Setup went well with no major issues."
1,Nice try,"Like the othert Delta products I have purchased.. I was excited when my new sander arrived. It assembled well, and looked impressive. Until I snapped the power switch and the motor would not turn. Smoke came out of the motor. I shut the unit down, and double checked everything, again! The motor turned freely by hand, but turn it on. and it would lock. Called support, 30 days later recieved a new motor and installed it. This motor started right up and as I almost got excited, it slowed and stopped. Then did the same thing as the first! I boxed it up, and sent it back. 2 failed motors, over 30 days, and I was still not able to use it! No thank you! Hope this helps!"
3,"Good, but not as good as I'd hoped","I always had a picture in my mind of Delta tools being the ones to buy if you could afford them. As my first Delta tool purchase this one just didn't live up to my internal hype.On page 10 of the manual, it says the screw for changing the position of the sanding arm can be adjusted with the supplied hex wrench, but I found that the screw was the wrong size. I called Delta and they sent the correct part (part #1346365).I also ran into the problem mentioned by another reviewer where the parts for the stand are labelled differently from picture to picture. Too bad I didn't read that review before I assembled the unit. It would have saved me a lot of time.All-in-all it seems like it will function well, but it's not as perfect as I'd hoped it would be."
3,Nice Tool...Once I got It Running!,"I bought mine on the retail market because it was immediately available (no wait for shipping). After assembly it ran about 10 seconds before all the smoke came out. Two months later I got it back from the Delta warranty repair shop, and it seems to work fine. Hard to believe that Delta could not get a motor in less than two months. Removes stock quickly, and can do the same to an unguarded knuckle, but overall a good tool if you need to get a flat surface on any kind of wood in a hurry."
4,Handy shop tool,"I purchased this tool when I was building rocking horses out of solid 2"" white oak. By the time I glued the pieces together, I was sanding nearly 6"" of solid oak. The machine worked great. Assembly was easy, adjustments quick, and the machine works as advertised. The motor has plenty of power and changing sand paper is easy and quick.What kept it from getting a 5 rating was the fact that the table for the drum sander portion isn't as sturdy as I would like to have seen. It needs to be re-set occasionally to insure it is aligned. Definately needs either a shop vac or dust system when using it as the dust sure flys. I would recommend it as an addition as I use it all the time to round over corners on small items, cleanup saw marks on heavy stock, etc."
5,Disk sander,I have not yet been able to use it extensivly I found it easy to assemble and the intial use showed it to be of very good quality.
4,Am very pleased with the features for the price.,"This television is has a lot of features for the price, the picture has three different setting. The stereo sound is the best I have heard then any other television I have owned."
1,picture problems,"I purchased an RCA 27"" tv about 2 years ago. I've started having regular problems with the screen staying black for several minutes after turning the power on."
5,Great music from a Local Name,"For a debut cd, I was impressed with the content. The artist has definately captured his passion for music here. A wonderful compliment to any jazz collection. I look forward to hearing about future work from Mark Hershberger."
5,Great fit and easy to put in.,WeatherTech makes a great product. Fit is great and love the center hump being covered. The gray color looks very good in my Rav4.
1,Glasses arrived broken,"Same experience as others here, these glasses arrived broken. I will try it again, but based on the prior experience of others I'm not terribly hopeful. Just by looking at the size of the box they were shipped in you can tell that there isn't enough packing material around them."
1,dumb amazon packaging = shattered glasses,"amazon packed the glasses loosely in another larger brown box. subsequently, all the glasses were completely shattered upon arrival.thanks, but no thanks."
3,Why are the pieces so small?,"These apples taste fine, since there are no artificial additives, but they sure are small. The average piece is 1/2 an inch by 1/2 an inch, which is quite pathetic and unsatisfying (for me). I have to eat multiple pieces at once to notice any apple-like aromas. I do appreciate the crunch but they also detracts from the sweetness, because its harder to dissolve and release the sugars when the pieces are this dry. It's not a bad product, but I would not buy it again."
4,Not good for a toddler,"They're alright. But not what I expected. I was hoping it would be more like the other brands of dried apples - crispy, but then melt in your mouth. I bought these for my toddler, but the pieces are big, hard, and do not melt in your mouth. I'm afraid they present a bit of a choking hazard for a one year old.On the bright side - they are NOT made in China! I suppose if you're into dried apples for yourself, they should work."
4,get the cheaper of the two,"I bought the one that had the changing table and canopy. There is also one that does not have the changing table and canopy and costs half the price. I wish I had gotten the cheaper of the two because the canopy and changing table are a joke. While my daughter does play with canopy, she does not play with the changing table. The changing table is simply a piece of material the velcrows to to the toy and the canopy is not stiff and sort of collapses when the toys are hanging from it. Save your monay and get the plain Graco pack and play."
3,This is want spawned Punky Meadows of Angel ?,"This is o.k if you like the scene of the pop-bubblegum sixties type groups. The sound is typical of that era and it is 100% dated . You must forget it is now 2009 when you listen. What I find the most interesting from a rock-n-roll historical point ; is that the guitar player of Cherry People ""Punkey Meadows"" progressed to stardom in the heart throb glamour rock band Angel.Listen to this album, and then put on an Angel album. Remarkable!"
3,Too Bad I Never saw a penny for my song,Although I wrote one of the songs on the Album (Ask the Children) I've never had a penny in royalty. Not the group's fault - the publishers know what I mean.
1,Omni Rope Hammock damaged upon arrival,I was dissappointed with this product. It had freyed and untied hammock strings when I got it out of the box. As pricey as it originally was I expected at least a swing that was manufactured well. But this is terrible. It looked like it wasn't even completely assembled!
4,Thrilling! It shows Diana's strength in a crisis!,"The novel moves at brisk pace and the timeline format always gives a sense of urgency to the situation. Diana's personality shines through during her kidnapping ordeal; inner strength and her ability to reason with her captors. I read an excerpt in the April 1990 issue of Redbook magazine, and although some of the phrases are worded differently, it was still a suspenseful read! The library copy I read, was the first print in the U.S., and there are few typos. It is interesting to note that Charles shows far more sensitivity to Diana than he probably did in real life. Of course it was written before their marital problems came to light. In one poignant scene, Diana wonders about her children's future and her funeral if she's killed. The description is hard to read."
2,Not for self-instruction,"As long as this book is used in a classroom environment led by a fluent spanish speaking instructor, it's quite a good textbook. It has terrific glosseries in the back. I gave 2 stars simply because there's no way you could utilize the book in a self-study environment."
3,"Adobe Premiere 3.0, new hp notebook, and Vista","New hp 9000 notebook, vista home premium, duo intel chips, 2G ram, 256mb dedicated memory card, and still the editing was choppy. I also used the patch adobe provided to address premiere problems on vista. I returned the software, and will stick to the MS Movie Maker until I read something is geared specifically for vista. Just as a note, I love adobe software and use most of their stuff for image editing, but this video software fell short of my expectations for adobe. Also to note, I purchased this because of it's ability to encode mpeg4. If you're on a vista pc, do your homework and see what'll meet your needs. -E"
3,Adobe Premiere Elements 3,"Though I only spent about 6 hours with the program, it works very well. I use it with my Canon HV10 HD camcorder, and it has been stable. In the past, I owned Studio 8,9,10, and it always would crash at some point. This program doesn't crash. The program runs slow with HD editing. I upgraded my memory to 2GB, and it's still slow. For the money it's ok, but I'm planning to buy a Mac for speed, and try Final Cut Express."
2,Not good enough!,This product don't work very well with Windows Vista. Also it don't work with quick time video at all. I am disappointed and there is not many video capture card that work with Windows Vista at this time so the HDV features is the only good things about it.
4,Works for me,"My camera makes .mov files, the DVD software I had wouldn't play any audio from .mov's, but this did. You can tweak the video just like it was in Photoshop, do music, narration, etc. It took forever to encode a 30 minute video, but the actual burning wasfairly fast.Warning-will not run on any AMD Athlons (except Athlon 64's or Athlon XP's I think) or Pentium 3's. Also won't import .mpg movies, or the 1 .mp4 I tried. Worth the $25. I had to uninstall Premiere 7 demo before it would run though."
4,Purchased for use with my Canon Hv10,"I bought this thinking that I needed to upgrade from premier elements 2.0 because 2.0 doesn't support HD. I found out afterwards that my camera (canon HV10) can play back in SD when downloading to the computer. Duh! Oh well... I am trying out this software and it seems pretty good. I think it is geared more towards the basic user. I personally like the layout more in 2.0 where everything is not readily available (i guess i just like nested menus).It seems to run a bit quirky at times, but all in all its a pretty good buy and has a lot of potential for you to make some pretty professional looking videos. I never had it crash. But just an fyi, if you plan on working with HD video, make sure you have the computer HP to back it up. HD video takes a lot of processing power to work with."
2,Driving me nuts,"After reading various reviews on how great this product is I purchased it and have yet to be able to use it. I installed it and when I started the program it immediate caused my pc to reboot. After several unseccussful tries I uninstalled it and reinstalled it. This time it seemed to work, however the next day when I tried to open it, once again it kept rebooting once again. I have tried everything I can think of but the problem continues. It might be a great program like many claim, but so far I can't say much good about it other than it didn't cost me alot."
4,Great movie editor and DVD creator,"Pros: Program is very useful for beginners, intermediate and expert users. Depending on your desire to do a simple movie with little effort, with basic transitions or to spend a lot of time creating movies with the professional look, you can do it all. I'm just beginning to address some of the many possibilities which seem to be endless.Cons: I'm unable to see the real time video using the Monitor (video is too choppy), even after rendering it. The only way for me to see the clip in real time, is to export it to an AVI file and view it Windows Media Player. Then going back to further edit the movie if needed.I currently have a Dell desktop with XP-SP2, 512MB Memory, 1.6MHZ CPU 250GB hard disk with 45GB available. Planning on increasing memory to 1GB, hoping that it will help."
2,"Great product, terrible quality","I've used Premier Elements versions 1 and 2 which were excellent products. Version 3 adds few new features (I bought it for the HD support, that doesn't really work.) It has many bugs which will snare most users. I recommend sticking with Version 2 if you have it, or waiting to see if Adobe will release a patch to fix the bugs. (If you are really curious, go to Adobe's Premier Elements User Forums to find details on all the problems.)"
5,Great software,I tried all the other ones out there and had nothing but trouble with lockups or the software was very hard to use. I look at Adobe with the free 30-day free trail and I could not believe how easy it was to use and how stable it is. I use it for both slide shows and movie editing and create of DVD movies with menus. I would only go with this software.Tom
3,Nice UI but poor DVD quality,"I have a brand new Sony DCR-SR200. The videos are very good. When I burn them to DVD with the crummy software included by Sony they look fine. When I use Elements they are terrible even with all settings set to highest quality. There is a ghost image when the scene pans, i.e. the edges of things like rocks and trees get a pixelated ghost edge trailing them.The software design is great. It's easy to use and does some cool stuff, but I had to return it due to this problem."
3,Adobe Premiere Elements 3.0,"I have been working with Adobe Premiere Elements 2.0 and 3.0. It is a pretty good and cheap software, easy to use as well. Probably the best choice for a Windows PC, especially if you are on a small budget. Of course, for this price, there are much better things, although not for Windows but Mac, for example, even iMovie, that comes for free with a new Mac, or still costs cheaper than Adobe if bought separately is much better.If you just want/like to play around with the video, yeah, go for it, but if you are serious, especially if you already have a Mac, it is useless. There are number of better software that will let you do so much more (iLife and Final Cut Express)"
3,Best for the money,"I am still getting familiar with the features on this one. I was very impressed when I was able to rotate my video 90 deg. I forgot you can't frame video by camera rotation, at least not until now!The only minus I have found so far, since I do some professional editing at church on a larger system, is that videos have to be chopped up into clips in the Movie bin. As opposed to the clip bin. If you chop a large clip into smaller clips in the project area, which is the only place you can do it, I am not able to easily save off those small clips for other projects. The only way that I see to do this is to create a separate project for each small clip, save it, then start the main project.But for the price, this minus is far out weighed by all the plusses. Good job Adobe.Dan"
4,Product is fine but don't expect your rebate,"Like so many rebates, there is always some mysterious ""Tab 1"" behind the front cover. With nothing there but an insert page attached, I sent that hoping it to be ""tab 1."" I also sent everything else in the box but the book. The online rebate center was nice enough and available, but they disqualified my rebate. I have offered to send everything I received except the disk and they did not respond."
4,Adobe Premiere Elements 3.0,"The workflow is ok if you follow the 'prescribed' path, but if you need to deviate, it is quite difficult to either go a different route or to find help on performing various activities.This program makes a great final product, but it is FAR from intuitive. I've given it a 4-star rating based on the polished results of the DVDs I've created with it."
2,Great Looking - Difficult to Use,"Great looking, marketed with nice features. Hard to use, instructions are poor, support documents are difficult to navigate. Owned 3 months and still having trouble burning DVDs with the software."
1,"Many, many Bugs","I am bewildered by the spam-reviews for this product. I have a brand new Dell, fully loaded with almost no programs loaded except Premier Elements 3.0. Here are the problems I have found:1) No web support or patches on Adobe site to date.2) Locks up importing Windows movie files (WMV).3) Drag and drop to timeline works randomly.4) Insert into timeline is error prone process.5) Creating DVD area sometimes locks up, loses background.6) Many random crashes to recover files.7) DVD burn caused memory allocation error twice even after reboot.8) No way to easily move markers in timeline (only delete and readd).In short, I cannot depend on this product to edit and package my movies."
2,Too complex,"This is a very capable program that has too many nuances. For just a simple DVD burn it is far to complex. Definitely for the advanced user, I am sorry that I spent the money."
1,Does not work well with Toshiba lap tops,"I had a lot of meltdowns, freezes, and crashes. I had to return the product to Adobe after calling them 5 times and downloading a new driver to fix one of the problems."
2,"Buggy, slow, and unreliable","PE 3.0 is buggy, problematic, and barely reliable. My first project was a slideshow incorporting video, stills, music and narration. This application frequently leaves bits of detritus files on the timelines, inserts strange markers at whim, and had copy-to-tape problems all on the first project. I've worked with Imovie, Pinnacle7&8, VideoFactory and Ulead. They've each got quirks, but for such a developed application, Adobe's engineers just can't seem to get it right. Personally, I think I'll stick with the simple Ulead."
5,Clear Glass,"We've been using this brand of glasses for about 20 years. They are reasonably priced, quite stylish, and imminently practical."
1,Old fashioned,I thought the language was very adult and archaic - some of the definitions might have been right in the 1950s or 1960s but are not appropriate now - see the definitions for colored or hippy. I would not buy another MW dictionary after seeing this.
5,Great Price for Hardcover Dictionary,My 10 year old daughter needed a dictionary bad that had pictures and was easy to find the words she needs. I would definitely purchase again.
5,dictionary,"This is a very child-friendly dictionary! It has colorful pictures, and the definitions are also child-friendly. I highly recommend this for any elementary child, as it will also transition well into middle school/jr high."
4,Grreat Dictionary,"Book used but in good condition. Definitely, book condition is correctly described. Dictionary is constantly being used for my son's school homework."
3,Alright for a second grader,"I suppose it's necessarily thin and light. Little kids must be able to carry it, and so they had to leave out a few words. Some of the omissions are surprising. You won't find ""kine,"" ""stoat,"" ""niggardly,"" or ""ubiquitous"" in here."
5,GREAT DICTIONARY.,"MY DAUGHTER IS SEVEN AND WAS REALLY EXICTED TO RECEIVE THIS. I DON'T ALLOW HER TO USE THE ADULT DICTIONARY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE WORDS IN IT. SHE WILL FIND THOSE OUT WHEN SHE GROWS UP BUT THIS IS GREAT. THE DESCRIPTION OF IT IS WONDERFUL, SHE REALLY ENJOYS IT, AND LOOKS UP WORDS FOR FUN NOT JUST FOR SCHOOL. GLAD THAT I MADE THIS PURCHASE."
5,Great service,"My order was shipped promptly. The dictionaries are in good shape. I was able to track my shipment. All in all, I am very happy with my purchase."
5,This book is big,Each night either my wife or I go through this with our 7 year old for 20 minutes after dinner. It's just right for him and it's a great investment in your child.
3,Shipping Woes,"This product cost $41.73, $19.79 for the item itself and $21.99 just for shipping the bulky thing.-1 Star: Shipping costs more than the item itself.-1 Star: Tub is not air tight and the lid handles do not lock on well, at all."
3,"Season 5 wasn't the best, but better than season 1!","It would have been fine to wrap up in season 4. But the show was renewed, without much of anywhere to go. We're left waiting around for the final six episodes, when stuff happenes, and is great"
5,Metalcore fans do not over look this band!,"Wings of Scarlet is a mix between Misery Signals and Beloved (us), without the singing. Its heavy as well as soft. Full with deep throated vocals, breakdowns and some melodic parts. They keep it interesting and had me begging for more."
4,2 years and no review?,"This is definitely one of the better records of 2003. These guys fill this cd with technique, intelligence and just plain heavyness that many metalcore/hardcore bands just aren't producing. I haven't found a band that I liked as much since 7 Angels 7 Plagues(RIP). If you like quality metalcore/hardcore you owe it to yourself to check this band out."
5,funny stuff,i saw this show on tv a few years back while puffin on an L with my friend. one of the funniest things i've ever seen. only funny if you're into children shows though :)
5,Incredibly funny,"I love the show and lament there is only this one VHS, while I watched the show when the kids were very little we often watch it again and again and it's funny every time. If you think the Toy Story spud is funny check out Bologney, Queenie(don't call me Skipper), Potato Bug, Johnny Rotten Apple, Dr. Fruitcake, Ham Monster and the rest."
1,Don't waste your time,"This tape is just AWFUL. The writing is terrible, the acting is sub-par... it's just a mishmash of too many ""special"" effects and confusing storylines. Don't bother."
1,John Lennon for President,"David Peel,Bought Bumper stickers.I had custom made.After John got,his Green Card in 1976.Then stole,my brilliant idea.Turned it into, a crap album ! David Peel,is a Wanker ! I can say no more.Ta,R.P.M."
5,My favorite Neil Simon Play,"Yes, I know that Broadway Bound and Lost in Yonkers are a bit more sophisticated but I find the characters, humor, and issues addressed more, well, entertaining. I know the play has been done to death but I believe it deserves to be. When I played the father in this for a community theatre, it was a huge hit, even though the community had very few Jewish attendees."
3,All In The Family,"Fellow play readers say that this is one of the best plays they ever read. It made them weep, it changed their lives, it is the only the play they've ever loved. You can't argue with that. I have read this play several times myself, but for me it is a play that works but it does not work wonders. I am a great admirer of the Mel Brooks, Wood Allen, Neil Simon school of comedy. There should be a plaque on the Cross Bronx Highway alerting people that they are approaching the stomping grounds of America's greatest comedic generation. Of course, we know that it was the depression that incubated this batch of comedic geniuses. Simon, more so than the others, has mined this era, tapping his memories of love without any trace of irony or insight. His is one big sloppy family kiss on the forehead. Still his memories clearly are those of millions, and what seems corny and undramatic to one reader clearly has the power to bring others to tears. All the power to you, Mr. Simon."
3,Different Dancing in the Moonlight,"Morrison DID sing a song called Dancing in the Moonlight. It was about running around nude at night and fortunately never made the charts. The common title has caused the problem for 30+ years. Same title, different songs and groups."
3,Worth It For One Tune Reminiscent of Van Morrison,"For the longest time I actually thought ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" was a Van Morrison tune, notwithstanding the similarity of title to his ""Moondance"". Come to think of it, even though the rest of King Harvest's album doesn't amount to much, ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" would have been one of Van Morrison's best if it HAD been his. (Sort of the way ""Vehicle"" by The Ides of March would have been one of the greatest hits of Blood, Sweat & Tears...). So, since I'm putting together my own compilation of Van Morrison's greatest as I see them, I'm buying this album to include ""Dancing in the Moonlight"" as if it were a tribute song (which it may have been, for all I know...)."
1,The sad thing is,that Dancing in the Moonlight is not even a King Harvest song. It was orignally recorded and released in the UK by an obscure British band - not even a one hit wonder becase the record bombed. I had a copy of the single - i can see it now in my mind's eye - it was on Page One records (also the Troggs label) - I know because they used so little plastic their singles would droop if you held them by the edge. Next time I'm back in the UK I will hunt this out of my old singles collection (which my ex-wife still has) and find out the name of the band.
2,"Great song, poor album...","""Dancing in the Moonlight"" is a fantastic song. The rest of this album is pretty lame. If you have the chance to buy the song on a ""Best of 70's"" cd or something, you might be better off. I couldn't find one, that's why I bought this. Not sorry, because I do love the song D_I_T_M, and it was worth the price of the CD. Just don't expect much else to be there."
3,hate buying an album for one song,"""Dancing in the Moonlight"" has haunted me since 72-ish when it first came out - every time i hear it, evokes a certain mood and feeling that transports me back in time. I finally broke down and bought the CD just to get ""DITML"" - and I'm glad that was my expectation when i bought it, that it would be for 1 song. I was right - ""DITML"" is everything I remembered, the other songs are completely forgettable, and not worthy of my listening time. I gave it 3 stars - 5 stars for one song, 0 for the others. Does anyone know of a 70's compilation album that ""DITML"" is on?"
3,Great Song But Forgettable Album,"Like the previous reviewers said, it's worth the price of the CD to have the song DITM, but don't expect much from the rest of the CD."
5,THE GREATIST,The book was great. There is'nt much more to say. The story never let you down. It is a true Fantasy book for all ages. Once you start you can't put it down.
5,Beautiful and memorable!,"I found this xd last Christmas and it was very hard to find. I had the album many years ago. It is sooooooooooo wonderful. If you enjoy early music/sacred music, this is the cd for you. The voices are haunting and beautiful. I really cannot say enough great things about it. So, definitely place it in your collection before it disappears again."
5,it's Gloria to the max!!!,"If you like gloria Estefan's music, you should also enjoy this unique video collection. You are able to see both her evolution as an artist and a woman. Look specially for great videos directed by Marcus Nispel (""turn the beat around""), and Rocky Schenk (""everlasting love""), and a cameo appearence by actor Andy Gracia in the video for ""I see your smile."""
4,Turn the beat around,"I personally like the hot Cuban House dance mix of ""Turn the Beat Around.""Great musical production."
4,Perfect everyday crystal,"I purchased this stemware to use in a theatrical production. We normally don't use real glass on stage, but this performance required it for dramatic effect. To our surprise, nothing broke and the feel and look was great. These glasses are handsome and practical and the price is amazingly affordable."
4,Good artwork,Again Guido has taken the erotic story of emanuelle and added something to it. His art portrarys what is in the mind of the young emanuelle while she is in the exotic loacations.It is not a graphic sex book but at the same time it leaves very little to the imagination.
4,One of my favorite Bruce Lee movies!,Bruce Lee is awesome! A good movie. Quality is as good as the original film. A must-have for Bruce Lee fans!!
4,Pic and all goodies that a tv can have ....,"RCA nice TV set ...Model # F25261 Tx3Serial # 949527824Frame CTC 185 AA3I love this TV... have had it for short time, but something came up that i am a little dessapointed, hopping someone will help me....Part ID# needed.It`s Q4114 some kind of a reg + (Is shorted)Present Part # is P12 NB 30 means nothing trying to replace it ..Can any one help please ...Thank you ....Mario"
1,Not worth the read,"This book claims to contain 60 offbeat adventures from around the world. I found none. So what if Doug Lansky watches a bullfight, takes dancing lessons, picks grapes, eats a steak, and goes moose hunting. My grandmother, who is 80, had done all of those 'adventures' too. Let's forget about the fact that the book is a tour guide for senior citizens, and talk about Lansky's attitude. He sounds like a fat, spoiled American who has a wonderful life but still isn't satisfied. Lansky manages to complain about every 'culture' he claims to have experienced. In reality, Lansky never allows himself to experience true cultures. He only takes part in typical tourist activites that actually contribute to the decay of the societies he is visiting. My recommendation is to skip this book. Avoid Lansky's egomania and pessimistic outlook on the world at any cost."
2,It's good for a funny line here and there....,"Basically...he drops a few funny lines, but doesn't really write about his travels in any depth. If you are actually interested in the travels themselves...don't read this book. If you want a few laughs....from a skimpy and slightly dull book, read it. It's not horrible. I just expected more."
3,"Inspiring, but watch the sizes","This book is inspiring, and the sweaters are adorable in the photos-- but why don't they fit the models? Most sweaters are two or three sizes too big for the child wearing them. There's a boy pictured in a sweater that looks like it would fit his father. I'm all for making clothes a bit big to allow for growth, but this is ridiculous.If you want to make one of these sweaters, check the garment measurements carefully to make sure you'll be rewarded for your efforts."
5,Raw Blues from the Juke joints,"Bobby Bland is a master at hardcore, juke joint-style, unassimilated, raw funky blues. If you like your blues PURE without British imitations or Motown refinements, this is for you. ""Turn on the Love Light,"" ""Don't Cry No More,"" ""Aint That Loving You,"" and ""Poverty"" will be a revelation to those who aren't familiar with the raw music that was the link between blues and rock and roll. This CD is filled with the REAL STUFF! Enjoy."
3,Not bad considering there was no help from the subject :-),"This book is in no way the definitive Cleese study, but it does give good background and some insight into Cleese and the characters he developed onscreen. Sometimes those on the periphery of the subject can give good insight because they are, for the most part, unbiased. Pick it up if you have the chance, and see if you can find the characters of Cleese's childhood in his comedy."
5,Austin Powers look alike.,I didn't buy the album but do think the bloke on the left side of the album cover looks uncannily like Austin Powers.
1,What happened to the ACDsee of old?,"I have been using ACDSee for years, and it has long ago become my default image browser AND file manager. I have faithfully upgraded through the years, and unfortunately have noticed a trend: what used to be a cheap, FAST and reliable program has become ""bloatware"", an application so over-laden with useless features that it defeats its very purpose: fast, reliable image browsing. I have actually uninstalled 6.0 (the new 6.0.3 patch does little) and gone back to 4.0.2. Even ACDsee Classic, which is free, will blow this piece of junk out of the water. It's too bad that they've lost sight of why this was a great program! It takes eons to catalog and view files, and the reliability is ludicrously bad. Whereas browsing through 1000's of files used to be a snap, it is a chore with 6.0."
1,Returned these,"I purchased these and it is not a set of 6, it is a set of 4. They are beautiful glasses but 2 arrived with chips on the rims and so had to be returned. Although I sent them back almost a month ago, I have yet to receive a refund on the purchase price. This was just not a good purchase for me all the way around."
4,nice,"These glasses are very, very nice. I got them for a gift and bought them at Linens 'N Things so they were on display. These martini glasses were great compared to the others; one thing that I noticed is that on the stem, they do NOT have that plastic line going down the middle like the rest of them do - Libby glasses had that, this one does not since I guess it is blown glass, the stem is very smooth. Also, the top part has this nice curve that fits the hands perfectly. And by the way, I got a set of 4 for this price, not for 6. *slap*"
4,Perfect for outdoor settings,We wanted an outdoor setting similar to the local Mexican restaurants and they worked perfect! My best advice is order 12% more than you need. They were packaced very well but out of the 32 I oredered 4 were blown when I pluged the string in. Small price to pay for such durable bulbs.
5,Educational,"This truly is the definitive book on non-fiction writing chock full of advice; you will learn, grow and prosper if you follow even a small number of the suggestions offered. The overall tone of the book is lively and well-written, which makes is easy to read and learn the material."
2,Expected more from Young at Heart,"Young at Heart may take you step by step through the process of writing children's stories, but it's simplicity lacks grit. Ms. Ramos touches on basic concepts, but spends no time going into depth. She writes for a page or two on each concept and then inserts ""worksheet space"" for you to practice on. Almost a third of the book is blank practice pages, which is completely unnecessary. The sample story she uses throughout to illustrate her points is umimaginiative and cliche. I would not recommend this book as a tool for children's writers."
3,Simple guide to writing,"This book gives a set of simple exercises to describe the main topics in writing creatively, such as character, setting, dialogue, contrats, etc. However, it should be stresed that the theme of the book is simple. The layout design given is most suited to picture books. This book would be great for someone who is just wondering how to put a story down on paper. Somebody who wants to really learn about writing junior fiction would do better to read one of several books with a similar theme that tackle the subject in much greater depth. These books cover such things as plot, sub-plot, conflict, outlining, point of view, and many other important considerations in writing for children."
3,For the under-10 child only,"What I didn't know when I ordered this book is that it is oriented ENTIRELY toward writing for very young children. Young at Heart may be inspiring (if a bit sparse) reading for those who want to write for the under-10 child but it seems completely useless for ages 10-16, which is my interest."
1,Propaghanda,"Of the four biographies of Muhammad I have read to date, this is by far the most un-objective and slanted yet. The author, an American academic and Christian convert to Islam, touts Muhammad as a military genius which is comical at best. The book is written with little historical reference. The author quotes muhammad and his cohorts from specific conversations as if there is any evidence or historical accuracy to these accounts. If there were, I expect the author would have cited them. The book is obviously anti-semitic and anti-Christian. The author dutifully exalts and explains all the violent actions, thievery, and murder committed by the Muslims in a way that would be believable only to a fellow Muslim."
1,Quit after less than 3 months,"Bought the Honeywell HZ-910 (very similar model) in early October. Used average of 1-2 hrs / day in corner of garage. Heating element quit in late December, after less than 3 months of use. Don't waste your money."
3,Disappointed in this CD reissue,"I owned the Cassette version at one time and the sound quality was much better than on this CD.Also on this CD, they faded out ""Magic Lantern"" about 30 seconds before the end so we are deprived of this number in full.Another minor gripe: all the numbers appear to be slightly speeded up on this CD. ""Ma Belle Amie"" on the 24 carat Tee Set CD is 5 seconds longer and I can hear the difference."
5,A great second helping of Capcom Classics for your PSP!!!,"I don't understand the terrible ratings of this awesome game!!! Okay I must admit,It's not a good as it's brother ""Capcom Classics Remixed"",but Capcom Classics Reloaded still is a great collection of classics including,1942,1943,1943 Kai,Ghosts and Goblins series(3 games total!),3 Street Fighter II games,Son Son,Commando,King Of Dragons,Knights Of The Round and more!!! Lots of arcade classics on one tiny PSP disc!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
4,Memories,"This is a classic mix of games from way back when! Some of the games are just a tough to control, but still fun!"
3,Son loves it,My kid likes the collections of old games best.His only complaint is that there are a lot of the same games in the different collections.Having been around to play many of these in the arcade the reproduction looks pretty good.Wish they had PSP's when I was a kid.
2,capcom psp,"this has acient games on it. my son does not like it at all, but my husband ended up finding games he used to really like. oldie but goodie i guess."
1,Not fun at all,"Good:Few fun games but they're nearly the same game over again. There are 3 street fighters and 3 ghost and goblins.Bad:Control is horrid. I think this is more of the PSP's fault than the game. The D pad is horrible when making moves that require alot of circular motion. Doing fireballs is near impossible. The analog pad is actually worse. The d pad allows quick movements from axis to axis, not the analog pad.There is no difficulty settings on the games. You're stuck with the hard settings. The loading times are also riduculously long. When you change opponents, there's about a 20 - 30 second loading wait.This game is not worth your money. Buy the other capcom collection, it's a lot more fun. You can change difficulty settings, infinite continues and they're actually more fun.Save your money and pass on this one."
1,Does not line up with God's message (Bible),"I looked at much of the ""secret"" gospel of John. I can safely say that anything named ""secret"" is nothing at all. There is not one thing in this book that is beneficial to anyones spiritual growth, simply because it doesn't line up with the gospel of Christ, nor the story of creation in the Bible. This is coming from someone who isn't a total conservative style Christian, who is open to apocryphal writings. Gnosticism is a religion that twists the message of Christ and pollutes it! Quit complicating the faith of Christ by adding false things. This book is awful, don't bother opening it or falling into its snare.Jw"
1,Requires $40 amp to make it work,This product requires a $40 mic amp to make it work on a laptop or Mac G4 computer. I found this out after trying to make them work and reading the customer support advice from Plantronics' website.
1,"Ordered this CD, got a different DVD!","Stop! Don't order this unless you really WANT the DVD: ""Globe Trekker Travel Guide: Egypt."" Two attempts to order the audio CD ""Globe Trekker - Ambient Journeys"" from Amazon resulted in shipments of Egypt the DVD."
4,Great Song,This song is off the hook!! She has a great voice; she kinda reminds me of Olivia. I can't wait for her alblum to come out.
4,Cool Song,"I just listened to this song, and I've seen the video on MTV. I think it's a pretty cool song. Not one of my favorites, but it's okay."
1,Can't get work done.,The rest of the saw is ok (though I wouldn't pay $800 for it) but the safety guard is a joke. Our boss doesn't want us running the saw without its guard & now cutting rails takes several hours instead of 1 or 2.
1,SCAMMED BY DELTA,BEFORE YOU BUY A DELTA SAW PLEASE READ MY REVIEW ABOUT THE DELTA 36-680.TRUST ME ITS WORTH IT AND MAY SAVE YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE TO DEAL WITH.IT TELLS WHAT I LEARNED ABOUT DELTA.ALSO I LOOKED AT THIS SAW AT STORE IN CT. AND THE HEAP I BOUGHT (36-680) LOOKED MUCH BETTER .THE WINGS LOOKED CHEESEY ON THE 36-444 ALSO AND IF I (HAD TO) PICK BETWEEN THE TWO I WOULD GET THE 36-680 $569.IF I KNEW WHAT I KNOW NOW I WOULDNT GET A DELTA AT ALL. THERE ARE PLENTY OF BETTER SAWS OUT THERE.WITH NO SCAMS OR LIES. (WARNING)BEWARE OF OLD SAWS WITH THE LABELS SWITCHED FOR NEW ONES. THIS IS A HONEST REVIEW.GOOD LUCK
5,my first big tool buy,"I'm a self taught woodworker so when it came time to buy my first big tool I read reviews, talked to shop owners and found this to be the best for the money I could find. I read that the table saw is the heart of a good shop and this has been true. I've used it to resaw cherry into 3/4 x 6 boards from 3 1/2"" thick x 18"" wide stock and made my wife a lovely sofa table & mirror to match. I would buy this saw again in a heart beat. Just don't be afraid to buy a great saw and a very good blade -- it's a match made in heaven."
1,Typical Commercial Hip Hop,"The editoral review states that Paul Wall is the people's champ and has been for five years. Paul Wall shoudln't even be considered hip-hop, let alone be claimed to have anything to do with people. He doesn't relate to the people of the hip-hop community in any way. His lyrics are unoriginal. He is just another artist who is fortunate to have been put on a track with a hot beat. This cd is worth it to you if you prefer to listen to someone repeat the same lyrics on each track of the cd. Stick to artists such as Common, Kanye West, Talib Kweli. These are a few artists whose music can be related to by the listener. My advice, is don't buy the Paul Wall cd.....just wait til it hits the shelves in a toy store near you. It will be right next to the children's nursery rhymes. Dmoney out. One"
4,Good music to drive to,"I got this CD used cause I liked 'sittin sidewayz' This CD is pretty good. I got the edited one by mistake and am glad because it has more tracks evidently than the explicit lyrics version. Also, that lacks some of the best songs. My favorites are 'sippin tha barre' and 'so many diamonds'. 'State to State' grew me on me and is one of my favorites too. Get the clean version for the extra tracks. Not a classic, but entertaining. I'll look for wall's next album."
3,It was descent,"Nothing to big here to me. But I did like my tracks ""Sitting Sideways"", ""Internet Going Nuts"", ""Drive Slow"", and ""Girl"". If your the sitting sideways type you will like this album. If your not real big on cadlliac music pass on this one."
3,The Spirit of Brooklyn (but I live in the MIDWest/Southwest),"Paul Wall is nice no doubt. The thing I hate about hip-hop right now is that rap in the south dumbed down the lyrical content. I'm not knocking the South, because I'm from that region per se. It's just that Atlanta and Houston owe anything they've ever done to Brooklyn, The Bronx, and Queens. That's where it started, and I've believe that's where the true lyricists hail from. PERIOD."
5,Aww Ready!! People's Champ delivers.,"look at all that ice in his grill -- more carats than bugs bunny's lunch. this CD hits hard -- esp. ""they don't know"" which gives you a little insight into what paul wall is all about -- good times, hot women, hot cars, and ballin' til u fall. as a former resident of the 'dirty third', it is great to see Houston rappers getting the attention they deserve. paul wall is all over the place these days, on mike jones' CD, on Z-Ro's CD (paul wall's ice is shinin' like a chandelier in ""from the south"") so check those discs out too. what's more -- girls LOVE this CD. make sure it's in your changer for dates, esp. if your car's got the goods in the trunk."
4,"This CD Is Hot! Most Tracks Bang and Have Substance, (not just cars & drinks but family lIfe, & sprirtuality)!!Good Buy!!","I am from Washington DC, so this isn't a bias review. I like this cd. It's not all about cars and that purple drank, either. Paul Wall speaks about his life growing up, his family and friends, in addition to his sprirtual connection with GOD. Paul Wall is ""The Peoples Champ"", in his own right. I would recommend this cd to anyone interested. It's not as bad as others have stated. Overall, I would rate this cd as an 8, on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the best)."
1,2005 Vanilla Ice,"This has got to be one of the worst albums of this year. This idiot is nothing more but Vanilla Ice with a grill. He sounds like he's struggling to come up with a decent rhyme. The rapping is terrible, the writting is awful, the beats are bad, and everything on here is just flat out terrible. There is zero talent in this album. If your looking for a good white rapper, stick with Eminem and Lil Wyte. Unlike this fool, they have talent. If you want good H-Town rap, go get The Sound of Revenge, Trill, and Already Platinum."
5,Way to bling your grill out Durst,"I love me some Paul Wall aka Fred Durst. I'm not sure why he uses an alias like this, maybe it's like the whole Michael Vick/Ron Mexico thing except the only disease Durst is spreading is tight phat rap. This reminds me of when I was hangin with Dennis Oil Can Boyd, Nook, Jon Creese and William Zabka and we were hangin at the Imperial Lanes when Micael J Fox drove up bumpin to Durst. We laughed at him and Creese kicked his Teen Wolf butt into the Lane 32 gutter and yelled streeeeekkkke!!!! That is what makes our club rule and the rest of you posers. Go Durst go!!!"
4,paul wall hottest white rapper since eminem,"Paul Wall is hottest white rapper since eminem. He is better Buddy Sparks and Atmpshere. People's Champ , good tracks are sitting sidewayz,I got internet going nuts,and big ballin His album gets 4 out 5."
1,Ouch,"Ever had blood profusely Oozing from your ears???? Well if you haven't and want to experience it, buy the Peoples Champ cd. I would rather pay $15 to watch 4 monkeys hump a football than EVER listen to another track from this CD again. You know those times where you just need a hug from mom, well after I listened to this CD it was one of those times. So in all, grabbing some 100 grit sandpaper and rubbing one out till bleeding or chaffing occurs would be more pleasurable than listening to this CD"
1,The People's Champ?!? - - Extremely Disappointing,"This album was extremely disappointing. I listened to it from front to back, and I kept hoping it would get good...and it never did! The ONLY songs I would listen to a second time are 'Sittin' Sidewayz' and the best track on the album 'Smooth Operator.' Right now it just seems like Paul Wall is a gimmick, especially with the fame of the teeth 'grillz.' His beats are mediocre at best, his rapping skills are flat, and this is all around a disappointing album from Paul Wall. I would not recommend purcasing this album at all."
1,stick to makin jelwery,"O.K. first off Paul your settin white people back by at least 20 years. Your beats are probly the gayset thing I've ever heard. Sittin Sidewayz sounds like something from loony toones, your lyrics are just flat out gay. All these Houston people sound the same. Your first album did sh*t so you prply got your teeth from the middle of the mall. You can't be a chick magnet if you 've never has sex dude. If it was up to me the Swisha house would burn to the ground. How come REAL rappers like M.O.B. and Rockstar catch a break. Houston takes up way to much rap room with wasted talent, Paul thinks he so big cause he can make chopped N screwed up tracks, anyone can do it.This guy has to be the worst rapper from Houston I've heard. I'd rather hear mike jones say his name over again than listen to this piece of crap. He's king of the parkin lot cause he can't get bigger.The only thing he's sidewayz on is a d*ck."
3,Funny,"It makes me laugh when I think about it. Paul Wall can rap. I heard him in {Sidewayz} and {Drive Slow} the latter which was featured on Kanye's {Late Registration} album. .... Paul out did himself on that song. If you've heard that song and didn't like Paul's verse..... then you needn't waste time with his album. However if you DID like that verse, his album is pack full of that type flow. ......Including the subject matter. Paul ain't a lyricist. He ain't talkin bout S*it. You're gonna hear a LOT more bout his car than his life. I hate that type rap. I really do. Yet somehow I can stand Paul. My brother owns the album. Though I wouldn't play it for myself, I can stand hearing it when he does. Therefore I give it 3 stars."
3,the beats straight but whut the %$#@,"Did he forget that he can rap? Why is it now it sound like folks from Texas dun went back to just ryhmin. thats how they fell off years ago. now lemme get this straight. you come back up snappin, get a deal, and put out some bull$#@!. why?"
1,THE PEOPLE'S CHUMP,"CORNY RAPPER PLUS CRAPPY PRODUCTION EQUALS CRAP. I DOWNLOADED THIS INSTEAD AND THE SONGS ENDED UP ON MY RECYCLING CAN THEN I PRESSED EMPTY BIN. FACE IT, WHITE RAPPERS NOW ARE CORNY WITH NO SKILLS JUST MARKETABILITY, DON'T BELIEVE ME, WATCH; EMINEM, VANILLA ICE, BUBBA SPARXX, LIL WYTE AND THAT NO NAME P.DIDDY TRIED TO SHOVE DOWN ARE THROATS BUT FAILED. HELL IF TRIED TO PRODUCE AND RAP ON MY OWN ALBUM I COULD SWEEP THE GRAMMYS NEXT YEAR ESPECIALLY WITH TODAYS HIP HOP SCENE(NOT RAP). P.S WTF DOES HE THINK HE'S A WRESTLER OR WHAT BECAUSE HE WERES THE WWE IC TITLE MAKES HIM COOL?"
1,The Vanilla Ice of the 21st Century,"This guy is just garbage. I can't believe that people are giving this good reviews. This CD is just awful. There is not one good song on here. Not even the guest spots can save this album. This guy sounds like he took his rhymes out of a Dr.Suess book. If you want real H-Town rap, go get Slim Thug's, Bun B's, and Chamillionaire's albums instead. This dreadful garbage is by far one of the worst albums of 2005."
5,Peoples Champ,Lately with all the bull that's been coming out its 3 cds that make my list young jeezy kanye and the paul wall by far. I thought with all the callabos it would cover up his talent but I gotta admit dude prevailed on this one. Though the beats and the chopped and screwed version relate to the texas culture you'll really love how he flows consistently over the beats. This goes down as a classic must add this one to the collection.Songs I recommend on albumRidin dirtySo many diamondsSittin sidewayzInternet going nutzSippin tha barreDrive slow
5,"It's Da PEOPLE""S CHAMP","If you aint got it go get it. ""I'm Jus Sayin Though""This CD is HotPaul Wall Goes HardAlll the tracks are dopeEscpecially the track wit T.I.And Oh Yes!!! Watts Chopped and screwed this to perfection"
1,Sipping a fine purple drank,"Okay, what can I say.If you like candy paint, purple dranks, eighty foo's, and grillz then by all means buy this CD. How many times does he say candy paint, eighty foos and purple drank in this CD? I am from H-Town, and this is a disgrace! Paul Wall is an embarrasment and so is Mike ""Dyk"" Jones."
5,This Is The People's Champ,"Paul Wall was hot on Still Tippin, then Sittin Sidewayz came out, that was nothin but hot flames. Paul Wall said he was the People's Champ and he proved it. All the beats were crazy, but Sippin Tha Barre and They Don't Know was the hardest ones. I definitely like March N Step (U gotta march like a soldier, walk how you talk it), the flow is excellent. Everybody get this album."
2,Honest Opinion,"i'm not really feeling the album. I liked the single ""Sittin Sideways"" and also ""Drive Slow"". But the album as a whole...?? it's not that hot. the beats are lacking... paul wall sounds like he has down syndrome... if it wasn't for the guest appearances, the album would REALLY be a flop. ""the people's champ"", definately not the highpoint of my cd collection. ;\"
2,COMMERCIAL RAP,"WHAT HAPPEN TO HOUSTON. H-TOWN USE TO BE A MAVERICK FOR ORIGINALITY. WILLIE D, GETO BOYS THEN DJ SCREW WERE ALL INNOVATORS THAT KEPT HOUSTON ON THE MAP. TODAY THERES NOTHING BUT WACKED RAP COMING OUT OF HOUSTON. COME ON NOW, ALL YOU EVER HEAR IS PURPLE SYRUP, WOOD GRAIN, CHANGIN LANES, CANDY PAINT, ETC... OVER AND OVER ON TRACK AFTER TRACK ON CD AFTER CD. WE'VE ALREADY HEARD ALL OF THIS BEFORE. LIKE OVER 10 YEARS AGO. THIS CD IS NO EXCEPTION. IT COMES OFF SOUNDING LIKE SOME KIND OF DEMO. SO PLEASE, WILL YOU WACK PEOPLE STOP BUYING THESE WACK CDS' AND STOP SUPPORTING WACKED RAP."
1,The worst debut-album I heard from a respected mixtape underground rapper!,"Read the title... this album is about as wack as it would be if your grandma wrote it...This album made me respect Bubba Sparx more, never saw him as anything special but in his baddest day he couldn't make any song as bad as the ones on this album..."
1,do we need another white boy trying to be ghetto,take off the grill next thing you know he's gonna wear blackface paul wall isn't that much of a rapper I hope houston has better rappers than paul and mike who jones yeah they been drinking that syrup too much and playing too many screw tapes paul wall is what happens to whiteboys once they do too many drugs.
1,"Not terrible, but not good either","He has the potential to do big things, but his lyrical content is weak as hell (which many southern rappers fall short). Quit talking about your damn grill and how the internets going nuts for 5 seconds! And I don't know what people he is the champ of, but they must be pretty ignorant. Just because he has some good guest appearances is not going to save this from a bad rating, step your game up paul wall, you're no better than No Limit with the crap that you talk about on your records."
1,No we don't want to see your nasty teeth or listen to your nasty music.,"Overrated,talentless,grill.three words that describe Paul Wall' album, the People's Champ.No really good songs on this album as they are all repeitive like Paul's rapping skills. Add this to the list of rappers who should quit rapping along with Mike Jones,T.I.,Slim Thug,Ying Yang Twins.If you respect and appreciate good Houstn rappers try Bun B(UGK),Chamillionaire,Z-Ro, or Lil' Flip."
1,Did anyone else hear that? Quality rap music has died.,"Just look at the cover of this album and try convincing me that this isn't a joke. With the exception of Outkast and early Ludacris and 36 Mafia, southern rap is horrible. The lyrical content is extremely poor and all of the songs focus on the same things: cheap women, cars, making money, having platinum teeth and telling everyone how good each rapper is. How boring. Remember when rappers used to sound different and make decent songs? Remember Tupac, the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy? That was real rap music. Garbage like Paul Wall, Trick Trick and Slim Thug is garbage hip-hop pop music. As long as rap music continues to produce a poor quality product like this it will continue its fall. Sadly, rap music has been killed by a bunch of extremely oversized shirt wearing, platinum teeth wearing, drug abusing, ""dope whip"" (expensive car) driving idiots."
1,"""Hey everyone I'm Paul Wall, the most generic rapper ever!""","OK so I saw a picture of this guys teeth on a website advertisement, and wanted to see just who thought doing that to themself was a good idea. So, for a laugh, I went to Amazon to check him out.Sure enough, the guy looks and sounds like the biggest tool ever. He sounds like what my dad thinks rappers sound like.Seriously dude, you're rapping about selling braces? Last time I checked being a dentist doesn't give you that much ""street cred."""
1,Ridiculous,"What is this wegro doing desecrating my presence when I watch the television? All I ever hear this guy talking about is his grill, see him showing his grill, invading my CD stores with this pseudo-retarded squint. People, once and for all, discover MUSIC. Don't be force-fed this garbage any longer."
2,People's Champ is Predicable but lightly entertaining,"Paul Wall is yet another white rapper to come from the south, after bubba sparxxx 4 years ago and another white rapper to come out after nearly 20 years with the beastie boys, only this time with so-so results, although this rapper has some promise and some moments, including sitting sideways which is a decent song and it also has very few insightful scenes.People's Champ is much more entertaining than who is mike jones, but I'm not gonna quite recommend it, so thumbs down for me.Music Rating: 2 1/2 Stars."
4,good album,"I was pleasantly surprised. i didn't know i'd like paul wall as much as i do. the album has maybe one or zero skip songs, but for the most part its a hot album with a refreshing sound. i love the south"
2,Not That Great,I bought this album thinking it would be good but I was dead wrong all he ever talks about is his mouth full of platinum and nothing else. He is my least favorite rapper from Texas and people who give album more than 2 stars need to go back and listen to this album again. Anyways my recommendation is do not buy this album buy Chamillionaire's album or Bun B's album instead.
3,Disapointed...,"I really like Paul Wall, but this album really disapointed me. I bought it hopin it would'nt be a piece of crap like many albums that have been coming out lately and this is one of them. There are 17 tracks on this CD. 8 of those 17 suck. 5 of the remaining 9 are ok but not that great. and the last 4 I can actually say are good.In my opinon the 4 that are good are: Smooth Operator, Sippin' The Barre, Drive Slow, and Girl. The ""Alright"" ones are: They Don't Know, March N Step, Big Ballin', Sip-N-Get-High, and Just Paul Wall. The Rest are not even worth listening to. Sorry to say that i regret spending $15 on this CD."
5,Such a lovely book,So well written and photographed. I love hear of people that have dedicated their lives to make this world a better place. Elephants are such a mystery and such amazing animals. Thank you for this lovely book
4,Solid Rock,"""Nervous on the Road"" is a solid down to earth album by Brinsley Schwarz. The album breaks down genre of roughly equal parts of rock, country, blues and pop. Without quite reaching the heights of its predecessor, ""Silver Gun"", it is a satisfactory album with several good songs, most of them written by Nick Lowe.You won't find classics a la ""Peace, Love and Understanding"", but the title-track ""Nervous on the Road"" and ""Surrender To The Rhythm"" are straightforward rockers as the group play them best.The ballad ""Do not Lose your Breath On Love"" is among Lowe's best Brinsley Schwarz ballads.Ian Gomm wrote only one song for the album, the humorous Buddy Holly pastiche ""It's Been So Long"""
5,judd fan overjoyed,i had had this on vhs tape but am glad to find it on dvd becouse the tape was not as good quility!!! Great price!!
5,Been Searching Forever for this!,"I was so happy to finally find this movie on DVD! It is one of my favorites and I couldn't wait for my children to watch it with me! Although the shipping was delayed some due to Hurricane Sandy, I completely understand and it was well worth the wait!"
4,Love Can Build a Bridge,This is a well done film based on Naomi Judd's biography. I'm glad we purchased it.
4,great,I thought that this was a great portrayal of Naomi's version of The Judds. However in the years since this movie things have been made known about what really happened. I wish there was an updated version that would combine Naomi and Wynonna's books together to make an updated movie. If Ashley was to write one that would make it even better!
4,$$$$$$$$$$$$$$,i love this movie so i was looking to buy it on amazon because i thought it would be cheaper than going to the store but seriously the price that is being charged on here is ridiculous that disc better be made of gold i mean almost a hundred bucks for a dvd!! no thank you i will keep searching elsewhere.
3,Cool Sculpture,"This was a ""perfect choice"" for a memorial fountain and the sculpture is beautiful although the dark green patina does not show as much variation of tone as the photo indicated. While that was a bit of a disappointment, I'm sure I can figure out a way to polish a few high points to give it a little more depth. I placed the order May 23 and received a shipped notice June 1 due to arrive 6-14. I contacted Amazon, who said the company was running behind about 7 days and would ship soon. I waited a week following their response, inquired again and next day was told that the order was ""lost"" and it would be reshipped the following week. It finally arrived June 26. The long delay caused me to rate this product much lower than I might have especially since I was somewhat skeptical as to the ""reasons"" for the delay. However, it has arrived and will be a beautiful installation."
1,loses time & not water resistant-Updated,"CONS1-this watch loses about 5-15 minutes daily (lost time increasing;2-has a screw-down case; if you don't screw it down it's not waterproof, and it's very difficult (sometimes impossible) to screw it down3-when adjusting the time, the date moves forward by a day, so you have to go thru the whole month to get back to ""today""PROS1-it's gorgeous for a diver's watchI'm sending it in for repair. If the company makes good I'll report back (Note that the ""free"" repair will cost me $25 in S&H;there goes the bargain! I wish I had chosen the Pulsar.UPDATESince the watch is under warranty, I've been calling Invicta (a long distance call). My experience so far: The company reps do not answer the phone, or hang up upon connection, or ask you to leave a message--which they never reply to. I've aske Amazon customer service to contact them on my behalf, but I don't know if they will. Perhaps I have a lemon, but Invicta's warranty is useless if you can't get an RMA."
3,Only for tall people,"These are so cute and would have been perfect for my costume if I was 6 foot tall. To keep it from having a bunch of wrinkles everywhere I had to pull them up to my hips. It was a waste for me. I could have just worn my regular white tights, no one got to see the cute bow. =("
3,Great addition to the Dorothy dress... but...,"These stockings are a great addition to the Dorothy dress but they were really long on me, they went all the way up like tights instead of being up to my thigh. The material is really nice and the bows are adorable."
4,too much padding,I have a similar model for my oldest and we love it. This seat has far too much added padding. I had to take most of it out just to get the straps adjusted properly. I do like the new latch for the shoulder buckles it is smaller and seems to be less in the way.
3,problem with reclining,"We have had this seat for several months already and I would not recommend buying it. It seems quite comfortable for our son (we used it only in forward-facing position), but a major problem with the seat is that it cannot be reclined when properly installed. There is a special community service in Maryland, they check whether a child seat is properly installed or not. So we went there and it turned out that when the seat is tightly secured, as it needs be, it cannot be reclined."
1,Padding is awful!,"Let me start this by saying my husband is a police officer and a nationally certified safety seat technician.We have a similar seat for our 2 1/2 year old, so we figured we'd just get this one and be good to go. While we noticed it had more padding, we didn't think it would be a problem. Boy were we wrong! As the other reviewer said, there is so much padding, it doesn't provide for a comfortable seating arrangment for the baby. He is pushed so far forward that he can't sit nicely. In addition, the seat had to be jacked up with pool noodles to even be at the right level...and we had to push the drivers seat so far forward to have it at the right angle. We ended up bringing this seat back and opting for the one with less padding...it works much better!"
4,"well built, this is our 2nd one.","We purchased one for our first child and liked it so much that we bought another for our 2nd child 2 years later.Pros: safety and comfortable for the children, fairly easy to install. Height adjustment easy to change. Easy belt adjustment for weather/clothing changes.Cons: hard to un-clip, easy to jam fingersWe recommend this product for price and quality"
2,Should have shopped around more,"I purchased this car seat for my car for my granddaughter. I read the reviews, I comparison shopped and thought I had gotten a great buy. My great buy was not as great as I thought. I experienced a very difficult time installing this car seat into my 2007 Honda Civic. No matter what I did, I could not get the car seat installed securely. I used the latch system and followed the directions to the letter. My daughter had installed her Britax with no problem. I ended up making an appointment with the State Police and they installed it properly and securely. The trooper was not very happy when I told him the make of the car seat I had purchased. He told me I should have invested the extra money and purchased a Britax. My recommendation is this: If it doesn't install in your vehicle easily and properly, return it !"
3,"Campy, silly, but fun.","Blood Angels is the story of a small town girl who has come to stay in the city with her big sister. Little realizing that the sister and the rest of the club staff are actually demi-vampires.Judging by the cover of this film, I expected it to be cheesecake. Parts were. But I was pleased to see there were actually a few hot guys in this too.Parts of this film were actually kind of funny like the Japanese kid who wanted to be a hipster, and the comments made by the master vampire. I particularly thought the ending was pretty funny.This is a B-rated campy, silly vampire film with a few good scenes. Rated R for nudity and violence."
2,I should've known better,"I am a collector of vampire movies, but I try to stay away from the cheapie home-made Grade ZZZ vampire movies. But every now and then I get suckered. Like on Dracula 3000 and now on this one. The one reviewer does a good job on explaining the ""plot"", threadbare as it is. The production values are very VERY low. The whole story pretty much takes place in the nightclub run by vampires. Dull. I gave it two stars because the actors (except for Fernando Lamas) really give it a good try working with what they've got. Skip it, unless you absolutely MUST have every vampire or Fernando Lamas movie available."
3,ahh,"Received DVD in a timely manner, however, it had a messege that kept popping up throughout the movie: THIS COPY FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY.I was not informed that this was a screening version. Thats kinda disappointing."
2,What a waste...,"Hot babes in black leather and fangs, a throbbing nightclub scene...great setup for a vampire flick. Too bad this one falls flat. Don't blame the actresses, who revel in kicking the butts of unruly male patrons, having sex with them and then biting them in the, uh...place where folks sometimes sarcastically ask others to bite them. The problems lie in the dialog and plot, which seem to have been made up on the fly, as it were. When the big twist comes near the end, you'll find yourself saying ""huh?"" Don't bother rewinding and reviewing...it still won't make sense. This could have been fun, but it's ruined, in no small part, by stupid male characters...a hayseed boyfriend, his asian buddy who tries to impress chicks by talking like a thug, and finally Lamas, an ubervampire whose attitude and behavior make no sense whatsoever. No suspense, no fun, no scares, no redeeming qualities. Skip this one."
4,Better Than Expected,"The acting wasn't bad (except for Jones' minions).And dude, female vampires ROCK!!!!"
1,Bad Effort,"Personally I didn't like this CD at all. She not a great rapper, and I feel she uses guest appearances to sell the record. The beats get monotonous, and the lyrics are annoying. Get ur freak on and One minute man are the only good songs on this album, and Ludacris is the reasoning for one minute. Im not saying dont buy it, however take a good listen to it before you decide too. THis CD just wasnt for me."
2,RAP CRITIC,"THIS ALBUM DEFINETELY HAS SOME GOOD BEATS. I DEFINATLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM IF YOU DONT WANT TOO HARD CORE OF RAP, BUT THIS WILL DEFINETELY MAKE YOU DANCE."
2,NOT SO GOOD,"THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST OF ANY OF MISSY'S CD'S. NORMALLY I LOVE MISSY, BUT THIS TIME SHE WENT WITH MORE OF A TECHO APPROACH AND NOT RAP OR R & B. I WOULD RECOMMEND ANY OF HER OTHER CD'S BEFORE I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ONE"
2,why did missy go there?,"Although I am really feelin One Minute Man (especially the remix f/Jay-z) and Get Ur Freak On, those are about the only tracks that are worth listening to on Missy's horrible 3rd attempt. I'm sure we all enjoy Miss E's creativeness and unhampered imagination, but some things are better left alone, like the [bad] Lick Shots and Dog In Heat, which Redman and Meth tried to rescue, but couldn't. I rate the tracks One Minute Man an 8, the Remix a 10, Get Ur Freak On an 8 (just cause the beat is ridiculous), Scream a.k.a Itchin a 6 and Take Away a 7. The rest get 0s."
1,...,"I am truly upset that a song like ""get ur freak on"" which has 4 words and TWO musical notes in the entire song can get a spot on MTV, when there are so many TALENTED bands struggling for recognition. That song is ...! Sorry if you feel otherwise. If you disagree with me, just do what consumer America wants and waste your money on this CD."
2,***Missy Stop Playin Around***,"This album ""MissyE...so addictive is not addictive at all, matter of fact it's one of the worst albums I've ever heard. Missy in my opinion is one of the weakest (less talented) female rappers in the game. Her first single of the album ""Get Your Freak On"" was horrible, the only good thing about it was its beat. The beat got everyone everywhere to party and dance along, but the song is a different story. Missy in her music doesn't have a flow, everything is in fragments like when she says ""now people sing around, now people gather around go get your freak on"" it sounds bad. And then every once in a while she'll add in HOLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAA. It's like not a song. I think she uses other top artists to sell her music. I'm not trying to put her down, its just that she could improve a lot. I would suggest buying albums from Eve or Foxy Brown artists with talent. SORRY if your a huge fan hers."
3,not at supa dupa fly level,"unfurtunely only ""get the freak on"" and ""one minute man"" are 4 stars songs the rest is almost boring."
3,Kind of an desapointing piece of work,"I was really desapointed when I first heard this cd..., It has nothing to do with DA Real World...., i committed the same error as lots of people,the one of buying a cd even without earing it...of course just because was Missy's!!! It gave me the feeling of having lots of songs working as just fill outs..., I mean, there are a few good songs, but I just thought that I would've had more to hear!!!!"
2,Very lackluster release.Big letdown for Missy/Timbaland fans,"I am a huge fan of Missy and especially Timbaland...but this release by Missy totally misses...I still can't believe she would release something so lame...of course there are a couple good cuts, but nothing compared to her first 2 albums...I think the problem is she is co-producer on 99% of the tracks with Timbaland. In the past that wasn't the case. That may not be the problem, I am just guessing...this album is just very tame...Missy always claims to have space age beats, she must have left them at home, because they aren't on here..Plus there are two hidden tracks at the end..which end up being gospel type songs..that made it even worse...if I wanted gospel songs, I would buy that type of album!! I am still a fan, but in the future I will think twice before buying any Missy album..."
1,Pure crap.,"... I never thought that Missy would ever release such a lame album. The beats are so, how can I say, the same. Nothing is new. Nothing addictive as the album claims. All I can say is, burn this CD during your next BBQ."
2,Avoid this crappy CD at all costs !!!!,"This album is a disappointment, since at one time I thought Missy was one of the best female rappers. I was wrong. Is Missy even a rapper? She sings like crap, and her best bet is to stick to rapping. The beats are pretty good, but it's not worth the money. Avoid at all costs!"
2,The fast-forward button...So addictive,"I like Missy, so this is no bias. But except for ""Get Ur Freak On"" and the ""One Minute Man"" remix with Jay-Z (and maybe even ""Slap Slap Slap""), this album is a disappointment compared to her other works. It's too experimental: there's like, disco, reggae, and gospel songs present but no theme or cohesiveness. Missy and Timbaland should go back to their formula, whatever that is. Whoever thinks that this is in any shape or form hip hop or R&B should spend some time in a room listening to Talib Kweli and Angie Stone. They'll really get some schooling. This album may be called So Addictive, but I quit listening to it cold turkey."
3,what's so addicting,"nothing interesting here so misy talks about freaking, big deal who does'nt talk about oral sex, or sex these days anyway, one minute man is alright trina being her freaky self like i said nothing shocking, missy at the end comes on like she's going to war, funny but why did she think to try to sing like prince that would make someone lose their high."
1,"WTH, Amazon?!?!?!","I am an avid Missy Elliott fan, & this is my favorite of her albums, so imagine my disappointment when I downloaded ""Get Ur Freak On (LP Version) [Explicit],"" & found it was quite obviously the edited & clipped radio version! I'm not exactly going to demand a refund, but that's pretty crappy. False listing, Amazon--MANAGE YOUR DOWNLOADS IF YOU PLEASE."
2,ohh missy,"When I bought this album I thought that it would be a great album, but it is not that great at all. I only found three good songs and they were ""Get ur freak on"", ""One minute man"",and ""Slap Slap Slap"", but the rest of the songs are horrible. That is all I have to say about this album."
2,"Missy, So Addictive, WHATEVER","The album is not that good at all. The only decent sounds are 'get your freak on', which is old and 'lickshots'. Besides that the album is very depressing. The slow ballads are just not working anymore. And what's with that sound 'Slap, Slap,Slap. Da Brat would have done us all a favour if she had kept her mouth shut. The only hope that the album had was 'One Minute Man' thanks to Trina's off the hook rap. Oh course the version with Trina is not on the album. Missy is going steadily down hill. Maybe you beats are addictive to her and timbaland, but definitely not to me."
4,...So Addictive,"This is definitely an appropriate title for the album because that's exactly what it is: addictive. Or at least, very infectious.I have this and Under Construction, and I find this one much better.A woman in hip-hop who's innovative and respectable. A rare find."
4,Definitely addictive,"Rapper/singer/song-writer/producer, Missy Elliott does the damn thing with this album, one of my favorites of 2001, and yes it is very addictive. Missy really pushes the envelope lyrically and musically (as usual) without repeating herself. Somehow she brings her guest stars into her vibe quite well. Missy isn't afraid to make a creative turn, in fact she and Timbaland are pretty well known for that. Hip-hop wouldn't be much without their innovation."
4,blazin!,"missy returns to form in her third full length album. although her previous work ""da real world"" was a fine effort, nothing she has produced comes close to the energy and vibe of this album. working again with timbaland, missy shows her true talent for beat savvy rhymes and groove-a-liscous street beats. the only real down point on the album is the duet with ginuwine...and not only because the song is a slow jam, but because it breaks the internal rhythm and flow of the rest of the album. missy incorporates new sounds and new effects to create a ghetto-club setting for her licks. truly progressive and a fine effort. buy this album if you are a fan of missy or of good r&b and hip-hop in general...you will become addicted!"
4,"If you have to buy one Missy album, this is it","I consider this her finest work so far. I always wanted to go out of my way to financially support Missy Elliot/Timbaland because they are one of the few mainstream hip-hop artists who keep challenging us. Somehow it took me too long to buy this one, but in this case, it's better late than never. This album is good from start to finish. ""So Addictive"" was created at a time when the efforts of her first album and her newest musical concept came together to produce an outcome that is both innovative, and on the mark. My personal favorites are ""lick shots"" and ""one minute man"" (remix). So if you're like me and late in picking this up, go for it, and enjoy."
1,Larger Sizes needed!,"I'd love to buy some of these rings, but my ring finger is a size 10, and my index fingers are size 13s. Can't we see some beautiful jewelry for larger ring sizes?"
5,J. Monque'D Shows Us What He's Got!!,"J. Monque'D is one of New Orleans' best-kept secrets. His music is like a fine gumbo; a splendid mix of Blues mixed with New Orleans spice. His singing is unrefined, yet a joy to listen to. His harmonica playing is sensational, proof of his many years of learning from the old masters like his mentor, raful Neal.On this CD J. Monque'D gives us a fine sampling of his music. Most of the songs are originals with some Slim Harpo and elmore James thrown in for good measure. Monque attacks each one with a fervor and each one comes out sounding like a whole lot of fun. I especially enjoy his work because it is aabsolutely without pretension, just good-time music.I definitely suggest that you give this CD a listen and when you get down to New Orleans, to try to catch one of his shows."
3,Beware of driver conflicts if you have installing an HP DVD,"I had an older version Norton AntiVirus installed on my Dell computer that I bought in 2000. Everything worked fine.I recently upgraded to NAV 2003 *after* installing an HP DVD Writer 200i. I have had NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS ever since. Windows ME used to hang 2 out of every 3 boots, after the DVD software loads, but before NAV 2003 does. After awhile, the Windows wouldn't even shut down. I uninstalled NAV, and everything is fine."
4,Worked ok for a few months,"It works great most of the time, it is unobtrusive, but it stopped downloading the updates"
1,Caution: Computer SLOWDOWN Ahead,"Lucky if you can still use the computer after installing this junk. It could break your email, the liveupdate will hang, the package can't be reinstalled cleanly. If you need meaningful tech support from Symantec, it ain't gonna happen."
2,Anti Virus Too much Time to Load ...,I find this product and all the update versions to be cumbersome in that the computer takes too long to reboot each time when loading the anti-virus. I've switched to another brand.
2,Crash and burn,"Had to install this twice.First time it would not run at all.Buggy and intrusive.Finally got it working, though."
1,Why doesn't it block viruses coming in?,"I think Norton could do a lot better. I want a virus detector that alerts me WHEN the virus is present. Norton came with my laptop for a free 3-month trial and I can't stand it! So far (in one week) it's let mydoom viruses and other ones be present on my hard drive. And to top it off, it gives me some lame message how it can't delete it or quarantine it. Gee thanks. My computer is a whole week old and this overrated software already can't fix viruses that are years old. I am very unimpressed and am going to do research on what virus protection actually does work and catches the viruses BEFORE they get on the computer.My advice? Don't bother. This product is overrated and unless you're a tech you may not know how to delete files that Norton can't do on its own (although isn't that why we buy these programs?)."
1,Do not purchase - has lots of problems and is not supported,Symantec no longer supports this product although they will readily take your money for antivirus updates. The system scan goes into a continuous loop and corrections are not available.
1,Do NOT buy Norton Anti Virus 2003!,"I have just spent the best part of a Sunday installing Norton Anti Virus 2003 ... and then repairing the damage!My Win98 system would NOT boot following the never ending install process. I had to remove my Borland C debugger drivers via W98 ""safe mode"" in order to reuse my PC. And the the darn Norton software INSISTED on dialling the Norton site ALL the time - even if I disabled EVERY feature such as auto-updates - I think it is checking the license validity. After a truly horrendous day with this horrible product I uninstalled it. A whole day and 35 UK pounds wasted."
3,The value is evident when it does it's job.....,"Quick to install and get up and running. Updates are slow, but I'm too cheap to ditch my dial-up. Virus software is like public transportation, it's nothing to rave about, but it beats walking (or doing a system recovery). I've been using Norton AV for two years and Norton AV has helped me avoid my share of nasty worms so I'm pleased.I'm not so sure about the marketing[...]however....the product is advertised with a very low ""after rebate"" price. In fact the rebate is two rebates, one for upgraders and one for the basic purchase. The [...]posting makes you think that you can take advantage of both. If you download it you may be able to do this as the proof of purchase is the confirmation email, and you can print that twice...If you order the box with the CD you must send in the little Proof of Purchase tab on on of the boxes flaps...NO COPIES ALLLOWED...thus you can only send in for ONE of the rebates....or is it re-bait-and-switch?"
1,No service,"Do not, I repeat do not buy a symantec product. If you are fool enough to buy Norton anti-virus there is absolutly no customer service."
1,a nightmare for me,"I've just spent a day and a half trying to get it to work. It completely messed up my machine and I spent most of my time trying to uninstall it completely and reinstall it. I downloaded all the relevant documents and finally got help from their phone line. The fellow tried some things (most of which I had already tried) and decided the problem was with the Microsoft installer. (He didn't charge me, presumably because I had already tried everything myself.) I didn't believe that so I reinstalled Windows and tried the MS installer again and this time Norton successfully reinstalled. But I had the same problem with it messing up my machine. So once again I decided to try the for-fee phone support. The fellow tried to convince me it was a virus (no way!) and then said it might be a conflict with another program. He couldn't guarantee he could solve the problem but I would have to pay if I went any further. So I decided to give it up and ask for a refund."
1,no customer support,"I've had continual problems getting the Autoprotect feature enabled. Norton's solution (response to error message 4002-519) doesn't fix the problem, and unless I want to spend over $20.00 to let them know their solution doesn't work, I'm out of luck. Terrible support design -- one shouldn't be penalized trying to get the software installed. In the end, how do I know it's working at all?"
1,The AntiVirus program that has overtaken my machine,"Do yourself a favor and do not buy this software. Although it works it is invasive and EXTRAORINARILY ANNOYING. After the free subscription service is up there is a DAILY reminder to send Symatec more money to renew your subscription. This reminder pops up everyday, regularly crashes other progams, and is impossible to get rid of.Per Symatec's VERY delayed customer service response: the only way to get rid of the dialog box is to UNINSTALL your Antivirus software (ie. don't use their product anymore) or buy the subscription service for 1 more year.What kind of strong-arm consumer screw-job tactic is this?!??! Don't support Symatec and let them get away with this."
1,The worse is Norton2003,"I used Norton all my computer life but not anymore after this 2003 version. If it installs without error messages, they save it for later. Open Norton window and ther you have it (1) the automatic scan is unabeled and you can't enable it ( options then check enable). Then (2) the email Scaning red ERROR X. And after that they want to tell you how to fix these error and waste several hours if it did get really fixed. NO THANKS. They should have fixed these bugs before they sell their products."
2,XP - Outlook unfriendly,"I've used earlier versions of this product before and was happy enough with it to buy the new version. When I installed it on an XP machine running the new MS Outlook, the program stopped sending and receiving email. Their support site left a lot to be desired and I quickly tired of this game. I'm sure that there is some go-around fix, but I already have a job and the last thing I want is to spend my time ""fixing"" a new product. I promptly uninstalled it from that computer.I tried it on another machine and it does seem to work using an older email system. But one shouldn't have to put up with a product that is not ""ready to go"" right off the shelf. Maybe some people like spending all of their time fussing with this sort of thing, but I buy software to improve my life, not complicate it."
1,Symantec refund not forthcoming as promised.,"When I ordered this product there were two $20 refunds displayed on Amazon's webpages. I received the one from Amazon shortly after sending back the required info. However, Symantec only sent my refund after I placed complaints with the Postal Inspector and the Federal Trade Commission. This was after the refund was overdue by two months. I had to take the time and money to copy all the originally submitted information and send it to Symantec with a return receipt. I never got a response from either of the investigative agencies but, coincidentally, my refund arrived shortly after contacting these agencies."
2,Couldnt re-install on my new computer,"I purchased Norton Antivirus 2003 in November, 2002, downloading the software. Received a new computer for Christmas. Called Norton for technical assistance in re-installing. Informed there was a ... charge for technical assistance. Asked to receive a disk for reinstallation and informed that would cost ""a additional amount of money"". ... I decided to switch to McAfee for better service and minimal ancillary charges."
1,Bitter End to Norton Love Affair,I repair and maintain computers as a sideline and I have never had a single problem with symantec products. I must have sold 50 copies a year of NAV and systemworks without a single complaint then this mess- an absolute horror in Win 98 and a pain in the southern region for XP. Keep Well Clear!
1,Buggy software,"This software keeps deleting perfectly good e-mails. Even worse is the fact that it doesn't tell me who the e-mail was from. So I can't even contact the sender!I tried contacting Symantec about this, but it has been over a week and still no response. I uninstalled the software and I am demanding a refund. Terrible product, terrible customer support."
1,What a ripoff,"Like any other common sense person when something says it's replaced by another, ie, 2003 replaced by 2005, I would expect to get the 2005 product. I didn't, I'm sure the seller will say the old version was being replaced by the new version but not what they were selling. And the outragious shipping and ""handling"" of almost $4.00 for what actually costs $.60 to send. I don't recommend this seller to anyone. I would give you less than 1 star if I could."
1,"Support poor, product buggy","This product (Norton Antivirus) was working for me until the ""Live Update"" feature broke it by downloading new client SW which didn't work correctly (in that 'auto-protect' could not be enabled and the email scanning option showed 'error'). After removing the product and reinstalling it (the procedure is a major pain) it worked correctly until the same 'Live Update' broke it again. The solutions Norton proposes for this problem on their website (with many complicated steps) don't work for me. I could call their $30 hotline but I think I'll just junk the product and get something better. You might want to know that the Norton web site will not respond to emails describing a problem with their SW - you can only use email suggest product enhancements ('Yeah, get the ###!""** working correctly !"") You must find the solution for your problem in their automated data base, pay $30 for a hotline call or (my recommended solution) give up."
1,A dangerous product from the virus experts,"Don't dare install this product without planning to subscribe forever. I just talked to Symantec about their nag-ware popups which will occur after the product subscription runs out, as mind just did. They do not know how long you will get a daily reminder to renew. It will go on indefinitely. These guys know their virus stuff and use it to their best marketing advantage. If you love popups and spam you will love this product."
1,norton 2003 will NOT work with windows 98,"i had successfully installed norton 2002 on windows 98,but the 2003 version contains a problem where the registryprogram gets into a loop with norton and you have tototally remove norton to use your computer. i triedusing their on-line help (since the sw only contains a900 number!) but norton is ignoring the problem. thereare dozens of posts on the norton problem database aboutthis with no real answers. my solution was to get mcafee6.0 and that worked great!"
1,Not worth the trouble. POOR SUPPORT.,"Constant errors and POOR customer support. No response, or very slow response to emails. Internet site is very slow and not helpful. They will charge you if you call them... after you are on hold for a long time. Save yourself the trouble and buy something else."
2,12 months only,"Norton AntiVirus is a good programe, however I was upset to find out that allthough you buy the software its only good for 12 months, you are then asked to subscribe for another 12 months, if you do not, and a new virus comes out you have no prtection.On the package there is a ( * ) that indicates the condition, the condition is writen in the smallest type, my guess is so that you don't see the small print. I rang Norton to speak about it, and was told its part of there marketing policy.OK so I am left with softwear that is now no good, and I am expected to pay up again, DON'T THINK SO."
2,If you must...,"I decided to update my antivirus only to find that Norton is worse than what I remember. It slows down my entire computer. And when it finds a virus, it can't close it on its own sometimes. In the middle of my school work I have stop and do a scan, which took over an hour.The only good thing is that it has caught a lot of virus here and there, but it's still too annoying and cumbersome to use. I regret getting it. I should have stuck with something else."
1,Does not work with Windows ME. No customer support.,"I have had nothing but problems with this software. It has many problems with the scan engine starting up. I have tried all of the fixes listed on the support web. However, I refuse to pay $30 USD for support for a product that should work. Beware!"
5,Excellent,"I'd had nothing but trouble using McAfee's Antivirus programs, so I decided to try Norton 2003 on my PC running Windows XP. You have to carefully install this according to the instructions, and once installed, it loads quickly and automatically downloads the latest .dat files when they are available. Compared to McAfee, this is a godsend."
1,Norton AntiVirus [is weak]!,I did not want to rate this as you do not allow a negative number. I would certainly not give it 1 star. I have wasted 3 weeks of my time and many hours or a highly skilled software engineer just to get rid of it.
1,WARNING >>> Does not work with AUTODCAD 2002!!,Watch out Norton ANTIVIRUS 2003 does not work with AUTOCAD 2002.In fact even after deinstalling NORTON 2003 ANTIVIRUSI cannot get Autocad 2002 to work anymore!!!!Norton knows about the problem and to date cannot fix it yet!!!!So now what???Just got to their site and read for yourself...unbelieveable
5,Still on top...,"Norton has been on top of McAfee for years, and remains #1 in the home desktop setting. Good integration with WinXP, Win2k as well as Win98SE. Sets itself up as one would expect, and does the rest for you. If you don't want to pound your drive weekly, just change the frequency of the full disk scan. No worries about having the latest definitions, as they upload automatically (which you can schedule as well). A well put together product, that has time and time again, nailed every virus infected attachment that has come my way over the past 5 years."
2,Privacy Warning!,"Symantec now requires, through it's ""Live Updates"", that it's newly installed spyware send info, from your computer to a third party site, before allowing it's programs to open.In other words: unless you allow Symantec (Big Brother) to extract, from your computer, whatever info they want, Norton Antivirus will not function."
5,Symantec Anti-Virus,"Everyone needs an anti-virus program for their PC. I've used Norton's program for several years.Easy to install & update.Inmy opinion,there's nothing better on todays market."
2,who are you kidding?,"Recently purchased 2005 version - fellas save your money. ( I had free AVG6.0 -that changed & went to Norton- have now purchased AVG 7 pro and feel ""clean"")- Norton 2005 caused a lot of problems with my laptop- everything came to a grinding hault. Email was a pain, and explorer likewise. Come on symantec , you can do better than this??. Reboot was terribly slown. If you want to turn your high speed racer into a 40 ton truck this prodict will do it for you..................Jonathan"
1,"If I could give it ZERO stars, I would !","This is the buggiest piece of software I have ever encountered. I cannot get it to work with Windows XP. Now, I can't get my online connection to work, I can't get rid of all traces of NAV 2003.I REFUSE to pay [money amount]for tech support for an installation problem. Something is wrong there - NAV 2003 is buggy - and I must pay for help to INSTALL it?!?!Buyer beware - do some research before you buy this program. I have spent so much time trying to fix my pc - and I still can't get rid of NAV 2003's *grip* on my pc!If anyone can help me get rid of NAV 2003 COMPLETELY - contact me at [local website] Thanks!"
1,Stick with NA 2002 instead of 2003,"Norton Antivirus 2003 is full of bugs. Unless you want a bunch of headaches stick with the proven version 2002. Norton Antivirus is still a much better product than McAfees (I experienced problems with them from the beginning, but never had problems with Norton 2001 or 2002.) Their rush to get a new product out by the new year has them releasing a poor product...perhaps they should simply name the product version6.whatever instead of by the year so they don't have to rush something that is clearly not ready to be placed out on the market yet!"
1,"""This Anti-Virus is Making Me Ill""","Having happily purchased Symantec's Norton AntiVirus 2003 at my local computer superstore, I slipeed the CD in and expected all to go well. No dice. I attempted to contact Norton (no weekend ""live"" help), so I posted a message on Norton's ""Message Board."" This, I gather, is Norton's way of having their customers fix their other customers' problems. On weekdays, one must PAY for telephone assistance, which I'd begrudgingly do, but the line's always busy, anyway. On Norton's message board I see that the identical problem is posted on an average of evry two minutes for the identical installation problem. (There are 841 customers waiting for an answer at this writing - (even from another cash customer.)Bad experience throughout. Customer service is nonexistent and the product just won't work!Sorry I did'nt purchase it through Amazon! I will next time, believe me!I'd give Norton a ""0"" on this if it were possible."
2,Norton Nags,"As others who have expiring copies of NAV 2002 must now realize, Symantec has made it *impossible* to stop the renewal nag notices once your subscription to the update service expires. To be fair, they may have changed back to the old policy in this version.Once per day, a box will pop up, warning you that you haven't paid your yearly fee to Symantec. Their tech support says the software was changed this year to prevent disabling the notice, and suggests uninstalling the software if you don't like the daily nags.I'll uninstall it all right, and replace it with a competing product."
1,Disaster,"I can't get it to scan my email. My old version of NAV scanned my email just fine. It can't figure out how to contact technical support (the web support is ""closed""??). I wish I had not paid for an ""upgrade""."
1,Symantec is milking the customer,"I've been using NAV 2000 and I've been happy with it. I paid for a renewal subscription to the virus definitions each year and that was pretty much all I needed. I don't like upgrading to newer versions of a program if the original one is working fine. Well, the first year I renewed my virus subscription they charged $3. The second year they charged $10. Now they want $25! That's just to renew my subscription to the virus defintions, not to buy the whole program! They want $30 for me to upgrade to their piece of junk NAV 2003. No way. Goodbye Norton."
4,NAV 2003 haas stooped 5 virues in my email!!!,"I really can't understand all the negative complaints I've seen so far. Maybe it's because I have none. I had no trouble installing it on my new Windows XP system. It has stopped every virus that has tried to get in through my e-mail in Outlook so far. I seen talk of it shutting down firewalls. I use Zone Alarm. NAV hasn't even touched it. I've also seen grumbling about paying to update at the end of a year. I bought a subscription to my last NAV product (2002) and it was only $9.95/yr. You are not paying for a new program, just the right to keep being able to download the new viurs updates. You know thoses just don't magically appear. Someone gets paaid to code them. Keep that in mind. I've owned mamy Norton products over the years (too many to count!) and I'd recommend them to anyone who wants to use an industry standard."
1,Norton is not user friendly-Save your money!,"I've attempted to install, re-install, uninstall the Norton package I just purchased multiple times with absolutely no success. I thought it was either me or a problem with my laptop-until I started reading the reviews. A side note-I still have 6 months service remaining on my original purchase from last year but with no luck on the time remaining for any working anti-virus on that package and the fact that there is no one and I mean no one to contact for any type of technical support. When you call the toll free the only assistance is to buy new or check an existing order. When you attempt to go to the address that pops up saying go to this site for relief, ""This page is not available"" screen comes up.So let me get this straight. I can't speak to anyone-I can't e-mail anyone-When I attempt to access the page that the system is telling me to go to, it isn't available. Well heck--it must be me. Folks save your money."
2,poor customer support,"In theory it is a very good program. I had many problems downloading. After 3 weeks of e-mails I finally got an answer back, which didn't solve the problem. You can call customer service if you are up to waiting on the phone for 45 minutes. I don't have that kind of time to waste on hold. I solved the problem by uninstalling Norton and installing a McAfee program."
5,What more can I say,"Big Mulie Racks and beautiful women holding them - need I say more?! I have not looked at the Whitetail version, but I assume it has the same level of trophies (in all cases) that the Mulie one has."
1,Kindle Edition Full of Errors,"This is not a review of the book itself, but the Kindle edition. It was obviously put together by scanning the original with OCR, & was then not proofread. The errors are numerous, with characters being replaced with something that looks similar. For example, Jupiter's moon ""Io"" is almost always spelled ""10"" and the words ""he"" & ""be"" are interchangeable. Words are italicized at random & sometimes just half a word is italicized.I would wait on a second Kindle edition with revisions before purchasing, or get a dead tree copy."
1,A perfectly dreadful book,"The best thing I can say about this incoherent, confused and ignorant book is that it is bad from the beginning. One need read only a few pages to discover that there is no point in reading any more. I read the first 80 pages, out of cussedness, but gave up when I read that alpha radiation does not decrease the mass (he says ""weight"") of the radiating object. There are errors like that on every page."
3,"Entertaining, but short on depth","Bodanis' book takes a more historical approach to Einstein's famous equation, and tailors his book toward the reader with a humanities background than a science and engineering background.The pop-culture references and historical asides make the book enjoyable to read, but offer a relatively superficial look at this equation itself. There is little in-depth discussion of Einstein's original paper in which this equation is part of, for instance.For those interested in the history of science, this book will offer a good read. If you expect to be able to discuss this equation cogently in a physics class after reading this book, look elsewhere."
4,Learn a lot and have fun,"I'm one of those people who enjoys knowing how things work. I loved physics in college. Although I didn't choose to further my studies in physics formally, I have continued to read texts and treatises on the subject. THIS is one of the best books you can read to start you off.While it is a bit simple with regards to the actual physics concepts, the history (another subject I enjoy immensely) is extremely interesting, and it puts the subject into perspective. It also offers the opportunity to begin a basic understanding of how Newtonian physics and relativity both play a part in our lives.This book isn't about formulas or complicated diagrams. It's a lot of fun to read, and if your knowledge of physics is cursory, you'll get a lot out of it."
1,Lacking in accuracy,"Bodanis is an engaging writer. Unfortunately, this book is very short on scientific and historical accuracy. If you want authenticity with your entertainment, this is not the book for you. The number of errors is legion, and many are quite significant. It would appear that neither the author nor the publisher saw fit to have the manuscript vetted by experts in physics and/or physics history."
2,Disappointing,"This is a very disappointing book because the author fails to do what he says he is going to do in chapter 1. He says that he is writing the book so people like Cameron Diaz (!) will be able to understand the equation. But even the delightful Cameron would have no real understanding of the science involved after reading this book - not even in a popular science kind of way.It's actually just a story of some of the scientists who helped us to understand the parts of Einstein's famous equation, but even this story is incomplete because he virtually ignores many of the major players. Even Galileo gets only a few words!Also, the author is not helped by his poor use of analogy. For instance, he says that as an object increases in speed its mass ""swells"" up. Anyone with no prior understanding of relativity would be totally confused by this comparison.If you want to understand the theory you would do better reading another book. It's not as though popular science books on the topic are rare."
4,a nice light introduction to a deep topic,"The secret to enjoying this book is to take it for what it is: a quick, entertaining read to introduce the ideas and history surrounding the revelation that mass and energy are different manifestations of the same basic stuff. If you are looking for any kind of depth, or complete scientific accuracy, or full historical colour, then you are going to be disappointed. On the other hand, if you start with the idea that this book is a sketch, not a painting, then you'll have a fun few hours cruising through it."
2,Do we need this?,"The equation itself is very very easy to derive from the quite simple mathematics of Special Relativity.E=mc2 - it says that energy and mass are equivalent.""c"" - the speed of light ( a big number ), means that you can get a lot of energy by just converting a little mass (""m"").Hence, nuclear weapons.I am all for books that popularize science, but not to the extent of taking a quite simple equation and flogging it to death."
3,"Large Print edition is missing ""Notes"", illustrations and more","A good 30 percent of the standard edition is missing in the ISIS Large Print edition. How disappointing.The Walker and Company edition (pub 2000) has 337 pages. The text proper is 219 pages. The remaining 118 pages contain the Appendix (pp 221-235), Notes (pp 237-299), a Guide to Further Reading (pp 301-318), Acknowledgments (pp 319-323), and the index.The large print edition contains only the text and acknowledgments sections. The link for the Table of Contents on the large print Amazom page is incorrect - it shows the ToC from the standard print edition, _not_ the large print edition.Additionally, over 20 illustrations and drawings are missing in the large print edition.The Notes and Guide to Further Reading contain much material, nearly 100 pages. If you enjoy reading David Bodanis you'll be missing a third of the book if you get the Large Print Edition.I hope this is not a trend in large print editions."
3,Entertaining but inaccurate,"Entertaining science history - but, eh, is it scientifically valid? No mention of the Lorentz Equations (Einstein did not just invent relativity - instead, he made the step of seeing it as real, not en equation). And protons get ""larger"" when they approach the speed of light? Oh?? Does he not mean SMALLER but HEAVIER? He seems to be confusing mass with size - a pretty fundamental error for a book about science. This rather spoils the book for me - he is really very inaccurate in his explanation of the effects of relativity.But - the stories are fun and -as fasr as I know the facts -accurate. If he were a bit more scientific he'd get 4 or 5 stars."
4,Enlightening and Enjoyable,"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It offers a unique view of Einstein, but more importantly, as the title infers, discusses the equation and the role of general and special relativity in today's society. The text is not by any means laden with mathematics so it should be generally available to all. Avoiding the complications of thick mathematics, Bodanis does an excellent job of clarifying the significance of Einstein's perception of energy and mass and, importantly, denotes the role of Newtonian thought and clearly presents other significant post-Newton, pre-Einstein age thinkers and their role. I, personally, found the discussion of special relativity and the lack of elaboration on space-time as it relates to E=mc2 a bit lacking, but still very good reading. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in better understanding concepts such as atoms, nuclear power, nuclear weaponary, Star Trek and speed of light travel, etc."
5,great book,It was interesting to read about the background and what led to this great idea. It is easy to read even though it touches a technical subject. It is a great book.
4,Teenagers,"Didn't read it myself, but it arrived in time for my son to read it for school. Packaging was great!"
5,wonderfully written; non-stop interesting,"This is a wonderfull science history book, with the famous equation being the common denominator of the people and topics covered. This book will educate you on mass, energy, and the speed of light individually, and then teach you how they all relate within the equation. Best of all, you will learn the personal stories of all the characters who were involved along the way. You don't need to be physics major to read this book. If you have a passing interest in the topics, you will completely enjoy the skilled writings of this author."
5,Entertaining and educational,This book wasn't about relativity as much as how the discoveries were made that lead to Einstein's theory. It also talks about the significance of the equation without getting very deep into the math and physics.I very much enjoyed reading about the scientists over the past several hundred years who made contributions that lead to this theory.If you want a general idea of what relativity is (without a lot of math) as well as a historical survey of science then this book would be an excellent read.I have one suggestion for improvement. I would have liked some illustrations to help me visualize some of the experiments he describes.
4,"Overall, an effective introduction to the subject","Although we have all been exposed to this famous equation, this is the first book I've come across which actually makes a meaningful attempt to explain not only what the symbols themselves mean, but also what the underlying implications of the equation are. Additionally, the author's method of interspersing personal information about the scientists involved with the equation after Einstein conceived of it, was an effective way of breaking up what can sometimes be a rather dry subject."
2,Opportunity Lost,"A solid ""C"" at best (not the c for the speed of light either). The main text of the book is a rather superficial history of one of the most important scientific theories. The substance is in the notes found at the end of the book. I only found them and realized their value after I had read the main text. A real shame.Typical of so much of current writing flowing from academia, the author wastes time and space sniping at his perception of racism, sexism, social discrimination. He even appears compelled to throw some worshipful comments about Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela as though that was part of the required template among profs these days.The ironic, and in all likelihood unintended, conclusion from reading the book is that, but for racism, sexism and social class ostracism, the theory of relativity would never have been worked out."
3,Content good; writing style flawed,"While I would give the author 5 stars for making thissubject not only understandable to me but interesting,unfortunately his writing style is quite unsophisticatedand in some places a grammatical nightmare. His styleis not much better than that of my college freshmanstudents. It's not that I favor style over content inwriting or anything else in life, but I would have enjoyedthis book much more if the style weren't so distracting."
5,"E=mc Squared, By David Bodanis","This book is such a great read. Not an ounce of fiction, but it's riveting, and really helps a layperson with some curiosity to understand how modern science and more specifically, how modern Physics applies to our lives and how the world actually works!Super read, easy to get through, and fun."
5,Great for Liberal Arts Majors,"As a liberal arts major, I have always appreciated when science can be brought to terms understandable by the likes of me. This book scores extremely well as such an effort.Mr. Bodanis explains the famous equation in terms easy to understand without being insulting. He tracks the history of each of its components, E,m,c and the square. He then traces the applications of the equation, the most famous of which, of course, is the A-bomb. He relates the race between the Germans and Americans, then the drop and then goes on to explain other applications of the equation, including in space and the sun. There is a bit of editorilizing like his interpretation of the history of dropping the bomb and his obvious distaste for power plants, but these brief interludes do not detract from the entirety.This is an interesting and well-written informative ""biography""."
1,Skip this one.,"The author tries to get away with as little effort as possible. The story has no original plot or thougt, but are made up of stereotypical and rather stale characters that we all have met before in popular fiction and TV-dramas. His story and characters lack believeability and origiality (of course he made it in marketing - but decided to leave it because it was too shallow; of course she was a cheerlead - all his female encounters were the most disirable, etc., etc.) His description of Michigan and America shows many similarities to an exchangestudent's fond rendition of a youthfull encounter with America - not a deep understanding of the country. I am left with the feeling that the author had a basic idea for the book, took a two weeks trip to the United States, and filled in the blanks from what he observed. This renders the book without a proper framework to build a good story."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"Gave this to my granddaughter for her birthday -- she LOVES tattoos -- but this was a big disappointment. She quickly got on to how it worked, but when she colored in the outline and imprinted it on her hand, the tattoo was unrecognizable . . . AND to make matters worse, it rubbed off immediately. We read the directions carefully and tried using it a number of different ways, but always with the same result. A waste of money, in my opinion"
5,My Son Adores This!,"After reading one good and one bad review, I was torn whether to buy this for my son or not, but I'm glad I did! My only complaint is that the color-in markers take a while to dry. Other than that, the tatoos are easy to apply (my 6-year-old does it himself), fun to color and even better to show off! This is by far one of my better toy purchases!"
4,No worth the Money,It doesn't come with enough tattous. They run out pretty fast. You are just buying 6 markers to draw and color your own designs.
4,Great Artistic Fun,"All our children love temporary tattoos. This one is special because you can color them yourself. We purchased this for my son's 7th birthday and it was a great birthday activity for all. Needless to say, I & the rest of our guests were covered in art when the day was through. The tattoos stay fairly well if you don't get scrubbing them too hard & are easy to put on, they don't stick and peel like some we've tried. They offer varied styles of tattoos, everything from dragons to sports. All in all this is great fun!!"
3,alot of fun,"The tatoos really only stay on for about a day, but my almost-6-yr old had a great time with her friends doing this! The markers and tatoos are very easy to use, just make sure to follow directions."
1,Not worth the money,"This is one of the worst arts & crafts kits I've ever purchased for my daughter. The ink immediately rubs off because it doesn't adhere to the tattoos. It smears across the skin around the tattoo and wipes off on clothing, towels, sheets, and anything else it comes in contact with. The plastic tattoos don't stick well, either. They peel and crack less than an hour after they're put on. Kids would be better off drawing directly on their skin with Crayola washable markers. I would give this kit zero stars if that were an option."
2,"Good, but faulty in some places","This book offered a helpful explanation of what true discipleship is, gleaning heavily from the Biblical account of the apostles from the book of Acts. Practical tips are interweaved with Scriptural theory for a useful book.Mr. Coleman's style throughout, however, is frequently rather tedious and difficult to read. It lacks enthusiasm for the task of discipleship, and its dry, intellectual style does not immediately motivate you to go out and disciple the nations. This is not necessarily a bad thing - it's just not what I expected from a book marketing itself toward ordinary lay people. I find it curious that it's become a bestseller.I also had some fairly significant theological problems with certain portions of the book, but I know it's not supposed to be some major treatise. Just be careful when reading.Bottom Line: good material on discipleship, but nothing that will wow you with verbal fireworks or flawless theology. Read it if you must. And even then, only once."
4,"Bonduel,Wis.USA","Ideal sander for the type of work I use it for. Well balanced and little vibration. The only two things I am dissapointed about are the dust collection bag doesn't work the best, but I have a dust collection system. The other thing is that way to many of Deltas tools are NOT made in the USA! I sure hope that changes soon! The quality is NOT as good."
4,Good dedicated sander,"A must if scrolling. Dust collection with the built in collector is adequate so long as you are not too agressive. Sander is quiet and almost completely vibration free (due to weight and cast top). Spindle changing a little tricky at first (would benefit from a spindle lock), but manageble once you get use to it."
4,A winner from Delta,I have only used this sander for about 30 minutes. It was easy to set up out of the box. It functions well for the designed purpose. I also bought the stand to go with this sander and there was no assembly instructions to go with the stand. I received the stand a week or so before the sander. There wa sonly a single drawing of the stand with no refrence numbers on the drawing. I managed to install one of the parts incorrectly but little other problems.
3,"Starts badly, but recovers","I have five Clannad cds now, and this is the one I play the least. I cringe every time ""Seaweed,"" the first song on the cd starts to play; it's the sort of brainless Irish chant that would make you change the station -- fast -- if you heard it on the radio. Once past that obstacle, however, Clannad gets their act back together admirably. Maybe not their best work (See Lore, Legends or Rogha), but very, very fine stuff."
1,"Pretentious text, weird typography","If you want to read a ""presuppositionalist"" defense of militantly unregenerate Calvinism, I'd suggest EVERY THOUGHT CAPTIVE by Richard Pratt instead. It's much clearer, it's written in far better English, it's unpretentious, and it will take up a lot less of your time.The text of this book looks as though it was photographed from a cut-and-paste of miscellaneous typescripts of different text sizes. The typographical variations appear to have no function. Just another irritation in a pretentious and windy book."
4,Replaced factory SeaDoo Junk with this,"I have a factory Seadoo trailer for a PWC and the winch grenaded after a few uses. It was a tiny little thing. This winch was way way beefier and looks like it will hold up to use. Of course all I am winching is a PWC, but still realiability is king for these kinds of things.The handle was actually too large for my specific application, I just retrofitted the previous handle arm to this one and it works perfect. My only gripe is the lock mechanism, it's not any different than other brands but I'd like to see it improved because although it's designed to self lock sometimes it gets in the way. Don't know how to improve but it's not a big deal and I'd buy it again."
1,"Does NOT fit 10"" Contractor's Saw","I ordered the Delta 10"" Contractor's Saw (36-680) and this base to go with it. Both Amazon and Delta's websites say this base fits 10"" Contractor's Saws- total BS. The base of the saw is 25"" x 28"", the mobile base measures 25.75"" x 23.25""... waaaaay too small. Now I have to hassle with the repack & return in order to get one that fits. And all this after having to wait nearly 3 weeks for delivery in the first place..."
1,Poor description,Same as previous. 36-680 does not fit on this base. I hade to go and but a universal base and will be shipping this one back.
1,3 Min O,"Terrible DVD. It looks as it was done back in the 80's. It's just a catch in order to get the consumer to purchase a continuation DVD. Pitty me the fool, for my buying of such media."
1,A Total Con under the guise of sex education,The DVD content could have been done in 5 mins. Titles appeared on screen and then were read out slowly purely to pad out the time. The most beneficial part of this purchase is the DVD case that it came in.Save your money and never buy anything from this production group. I can only repeat RUBBISH RUBBISH. I rate this item as minus 10 stars not the 1 given at the beginning.
2,DISAPPOINTED WITH WELCOMED CONSENSUS,"I have purchased most of all the dvd's put out by welcomed consensus. an was quite satisifed by their other products..The entire dvd could have been done in 5 minuet's. It's a play on their other dvd,""Deliberate Orgasm ""... 3 min orgasm should have been promoted as a info-comerical... it was 30 minuet's of hype"
4,Kansas City is home to plenty of rap talent mayne,"MAN! I'm happy i got my hands on this one. Murder Dog Presents Kansas City is the hardest rap record released this year. Especially for a compilation. There's not one sleeper in the bunch. While so many labels are focusing on exploiting who they think will be the next big thing, it's fantastic to see a magazine like Murder Dog reaching out to these young cats and actually giving them a chance to be heard. This really is something special and any rap fanatic should pick it up. Especially fans of the Bay Area and Midwest sounds. this is like the perfect combination from the best of both worlds. Do not sleep."
4,Exactly what was stated for purchase,"I was happy with the item I purchased. It was exactly what the seller said it was. Small tear on bottom of spine and clean on the inside. I knew what to expect and got exactly that. No more, no less it was spot on. This is an item out of print so I was happy to get it even with the small split in the cover. EVERYONE should read this book that has EVER had questions about our begining existence. Enjoy, I sure am."
3,Pure Bubblegum!,"It is basically the vinyl ""Juiciest Fruitgum"" LP from the old Buddah label with some other ""filler"" tracks"" added. I hadn't listened to them in years, I remember them as sounding better back then. I guess the ears of a fifteen year old are different than a fourty-five year old!"
3,Simon says play this record and have fun.,A musical cotton-candy delight. Still provides a welcome celebration of the lighter side of life for those of us who came to age during a turbulent era.
3,Entertaining and educational,"This was another book that my daughter (age 6) picked out at the school book drive for me to read to her. This was the second book we read from the Animal Ark series, and like the other we read, it stands pretty well on its own. My daughter enjoyed this story, and I appreciate that the main characters, Mandy and James, are considerate and responsible children. I find such positive characters refreshing. While the main story is about a younger girl, Polly, and her fear of horses, this book also includes a second storyline about a community pagent, and provides a detailed setting for the primary story. This was another fun book to read to my daughter, and should entertain young readers ready for easy chapter books, especially if they are interested in horses."
1,bad candy! stay!,This stuff I expected to be like Twizzlers. It was more like plastic. Inedible. A huge waste of money.
2,YUCKY! Not worth my weight watchers points!,"I bought these with the hopes I could eat them at the movie theater and save myself the extra calories. I started Weight Watchers 3 months ago and you can have 7 vines for 2 points which is really good. I tasted these as soon as I got them in the mail, YUCK! They are super hard to chew, it took me 20 minutes to chew 1 bite and I thought I was going to rip a tooth out. They have a horrible waxy weird aftertaste that is really bad. My husband likes to chew on them for hours (because 1 will take you an hour to chew!) but he hates the taste. I would spend your money on something other than this."
1,Tastes good but should have a warning label--CAUSES GAS!,"Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand. I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them. That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence. It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines. I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk. Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself. I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem. I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning ""may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence!"""
2,Very Stale,I also has a subscription for this item.... I have cancelled it because the last few times they have been stale and very hard. Too bad because I love the product.
4,Great taste but Came a little stale,"These taste really good, i'm not sure if it's because of what they use instead of sugar or not, but mine were pretty hard. It could have been they were stale but if you've had old or stale licorice, sugarless or not, then you know what i'm talking about.The taste is pretty good however, i could tell the difference between regular and sugarfree, but it's not overwhelming or bad in any way.I would buy these again."
2,"Good price, but very stale and tough","I love sugar-free Red Vines, and have ordered them from another company and received fresh ones - yummy! These spoiled me for life - I cannot tolerate stale ones anymore because they are so much work to chew. I had gotten a subscription from Amazon because I don't like to run out, but they seemed to get more stale with each delivery. I finally gave up and cancelled my subscription. Back to Twizzlers!"
3,You never know what you'll get,"I love these, and they are a great treat as I'm diabetic. As many other reviews state, some come very fresh-but others are a bit dry and hard to chew. When you by a box of 12, you may get 12 bags that are not at all enjoyable. Amazon gave me a refund when I complained.When I find these in a local store, I buy just 1 or 2 bags to see if they are fresh. If they are I will buy up many more and hope they are all fresh. It doesn't seem to matter what the sell-by date is, some are just hard to chew. I have wondered if they maybe get frozen or at least cold in shipment to Amazon or the local store.Bottom line....If they are fresh and easy to chew as they should be they're great. 5 stars-If your unlucky and receive chewy vines, you just paid for 12 bags of near uneatable junk."
1,Taste Like Straw,These sugar-free strawberry licorice sticks taste more like straw than candy. They taste artificially flavored and are not very appealing. I do not believe I shall re-order them.
1,What Happened?,"I have purchased many boxes of this product. In the past each and every bag in the box contained a nice, soft, chewy product. Something happened along the way, though. With the purchase of the last two boxes, the bags have contained product so hard it can hardly be chewed. In fact, we haven't opened more than one or two bags in each box, just to test it. My wife and I have made the decision that we will not be purchasing this product any more. We wish we knew what happened."
2,Strawberry Red Vines,"The last shipment of red vines contained stale, hard candy. Previous shipments were fresher, similar to what we get at the store."
2,Not what I thought it was about,I thought this would be a memoir of an Amish farm with a lot of farming details. It turned out to be mostly about bird watching. I am not into birds so it wasn't very good to me.
4,Survival or emergency kit...,"At $6 this made in China sewing kit is good for a survival kit or emergency use. The reusable bag is nice, even better if the packaging didn't stick to it, guess it was in there for quite some time! :) The scissors are just what you would expect at this price point, my knife would be better. It does have a nice selection of different color threads, 2 pins, 4 buttons, 1 med safety pin, 1 small safety pin, 2 small pins, and 3 needles in another small plastic pouch. A 25 inch paper tape, cheap threader and the scissors. This is one of the more flatter and compact kits I have seen and is good value for the price. The size is 3 1/4 W x 2 1/4 H less than 1/4"" thick. see photo's, hope this helps!"
2,Dont get it,You are better off with hotel room kits... absolute disappointment.the scissors are pathetic and useless. the strings are ok so are the needles. that's about it.
3,Better than no sewing kit.,"I put this in my hat about 2 months ago because it was nice and thin. The pouch degraded and I could have easily had loose pins and needles in the top of my head. the scissors rusted and the paper holding the string broke down.I gave it three stars because I have another in an Altoids tin kit and it seems fine, just don't put it in your hat or anywhere that may get wet."
5,Wonderful book,"I was at the library searching for something to read, and the beautiful dog on the cover caught my eye. I had no idea that this book would help me deal with the loss of my cat Ruffles, who had been my companion and friend for 14 years. This book speaks to all pet lovers. A great read.JeriAshburn, VA"
3,Good book but not whats expected,"I enjoyed reading this book very much. Kathy Albrecht stories were nice to read-I read it front to back in 3 days, however i originally ordered this book to help in finding my lost cat and expected it to be a large reference on ideas on how to find a lost cat. But that wasnt the case there is only 5 pages out of the whole book on this topic. The rest is kathy's adventures in police work, canines, the loss of her pets and how she become a lost pet detective. She does speak of her searches for a few lost pets.If you want a good read this is a good book. But if you are looking for a lost pet better to go to her website and read the information there."
2,Classic but too old,This is a classic book on least squares problems. It has been cited extensively. But it is written in 1970s. I think it is not good for self-learning or reference. The notations are very old and the structure should be refined.
5,Great for Sensitive Skin,"I love these wipes, they are great for sensitive skin. But last time I tried to order them they said that they weren't available any longer. Please bring them back!!"
1,Merchant takes too long to ship item,"I wouldn't order baby wipes from Amazon. I've waited more than 4 weeks and they still have not arrived. Is it worth saving a few bucks if you have to wait that long? What if you forget about the order and then your credit card is charged? You then lose more than a few bucks. I've had success with order pampers diapers. Ordering Enfamil has not been reliable, seems Costco is the best deal. Wipes are terrible."
3,Good Stuff,"I gave this item 3 stars not because there was anything wrong with it, but simply because they are baby wipes. They do the job, and the price was affordable. The shipping took forever but it's an acceptable trade off for the price. I will order again when we run out (which will be sooner than later) but this time I will order well in advance."
2,"4 x 36"" Delta sanding belt is unusable","I purchased the Delta Sanding Belt for use on a Hitachi Belt/Disc Sander from Amazon. The seam on the belt was so poorly joined that it produced a ""bump"" as it rotated making it impossible to sand a flat surface with the belt. I threw it away. It was a waste of money. That quality of belt should not sell for almost $10 anyway, but more like $2.50. Do not purchase Delta Sanding belts at this price point. If you want poor belts, buy cheap belts!"
4,Good Book,This is an interesting book to say the least. I purchased the book for a seminary class and I have decided to keep it for my personal library. It outlines different personality types and how they interact especially in clergy vs clergy and clergy laity roles. My wife and I discovered some differences in how we think and communicate based on taking quick survey in one of the early chapters. A good asset for dealing with differences of opinion and conflict management.
4,Meyers-Briggs and Christian Ministry,"I ordered and read this book for a course at Western Seminary (Portland, OR) and found it very helpful. It takes the Meyers-Briggs personality inventory and correlates the personality types to successful patterns of vocational Christian ministry. Not only that, but the book then discusses the strengths and limitation of certain personality types to various challenges within ministry. The book, controversially for some people, correlates spirituality and temptation to sin with various personality types. In all, a helpful insight that gets closer to objective predictors of ministry accomplishment than the pastoral ministry has had available before."
1,Not recommended,"I decided to finally update my virus protection and purchased NAV Pro Ed. Following their installation instructions to the letter (letting their internet site scan for current viruses, uninstalling the old virus program, etc), I attempted to get it to work on my Win98 system. I was getting numerous error messages (if I closed the error messages it would restart my computer) so I followed the Symantec Support internet site instructions for solving the error messages. I successfully eradicated the error messages but when I couldn't get the program to run at all their solution was to un-do the changes I had made. Which of course gave me the error messages back and the annoying re-starts. After about 16 hours of going in circles and getting very poor support (if you can't find the answer online, you have to pay for a phone call or hope that someone answers an email at some point and then actually solves your problem) I have decided to return the program and go with AVG."
4,Comfortable Back and Straps,"The Lowepro Backpack is nondescript in appearance, probably on par with the standard black computer bag. Functionally it is great! There are multiple sections and pockets to hold everything a pack rat could want. Both the straps and back of the bag are covered in soft, padded, ventilated materials. I can barely tell that I am carrying around a large laptop."
3,Notebook Backpack,"Delivery service was excellent. The bag was well crafted and had great compartments. But, I felt the bag was to big (it covered by entire back and below. I did return it about 3 weeks ago but the money has not been credited to my account (yet)."
4,Great Commuter/Student Bag... Not a Carry-All.,"Great notebook bag for the daily commuter or student. Fantastic assortment of pockets, but don't expect to fit much more than your laptop and a school book or two in the main compartment. I was slightly disappointed, as I bought this bag to serve as a carry-on for a trip overseas. I couldn't even fit a sweatshirt in the large compartment. I gave it four stars because it held up great, very well built, with no blatant design flaws. And it fits a surprising amount of small gadgets to accompany your notebook."
4,Almost perfect,"The bag has plenty of room, opens and closes well and fits well on the back because of adjustable straps. It does like more like plastic than leather so it looks a bit cheap. I'm going for function rather than style."
5,Lowepro Tropolis - I love it!!!,This backpack for a widescreen laptop is amazing. I am so happy with it. I would recommend it to anyone. It is easy to carry yet as nice as a great piece of luggage.
4,Great 17 inch laptop/travel backpack,"This is a great deal. Great bag,backpack for travel with 17 inch laptop. Looks good too. Light weight. Only payed 8 bucks after signing up for an Amazon credit card. I love amazon!"
3,Not for me...,"I am a first year female college student and I wanted to find a backpack for my 17"" widescreen HP. It fits perfectly and has a bunch of nice compartments but it's pretty heavy on my 10-minute walk to class with just my laptop and battery (I'm 5'3"" at 125 pounds).I was expecting the backpack to be smaller because I wanted to hide the fact that I was carrying around a laptop for safety reasons but it is very apparent that it is backpack with a laptop in it. And it is kind of embarrassing to carry around this suitcase-looking backpack. I think this product would be better suited for men.On the other hand, it is very sturdy and well-made. But if I had to do it all over again, I would have purchased a different one."
4,Nice But A Bit Small for My Dell 1764,"It is a quality product, but a little small for Dell 1764. It just fits it but streches to the extreme for the height. I wish it could be 1 inch taller and 1 inch thicker."
1,...Next ...,"I was extremely disappointed in the writing and flimsy story of River Beneath the River ...,esp . so because the message is an important one but who wants to traverse through character cut outs and cutesy Hallmark endings to get there . I would have to say that this was the most poorly written piece of mass produced literature that I have read and it speaks to the overall dumbing down and quality drop in the publishing industry .There are so many great writers and books that have deep timeless wisdom and learnings to impart ,we don't have to settle."
2,Weakened Warriors,"Resnick's Alternates series is my personal favorite collection of alternate history stories, as editor Resnick has commissioned a wide variety of fiction writers in each to imagine alternate timelines and individuals. But Alternate Warriors fails where books like Alternate Kennedys and Alternate Presidents succeeds. While Mohandas Gandhi's evolution into a radical terrorist is plausible, many of the stories here -- Jane Austen captaining a warship? -- are just silly. Worse, they're not even interesting."
1,Do not buy this one!,This book was the biggest disappointment! The translations were terrible and you would do better to buy a good English/Spanish Dictionary.
4,Very Good!,"Being a metal fan from the 80's, the transition to the new era has not been easy. I love Stratovarius and I also like Michael Kiske and Tobi Sammet vocals. I liked the material a lot! Newcomers may not like it at all, but even the other vocalist makes a very good job. I still wanted to hear more riffs, I hope Tolki works on this next time. The material sounds better than last CD from Stratovarius. If you are a heavy metal fan, the material won't dissapoint you!"
4,"Revolution Reinassance "" New Era ""","Excellent power metal band from Finland, this was intended to be a Stratovarious album in the beginning but it turned out to be a different project and what a project it is what else can you expect from Timo Tolkki and guest musicians such as Michael Kiske( ex-Helloween ) and Tobias Sammet( Edguy ) a real masterpiece I totally recommend it."
2,no gutiar shredding,Whats up TollkiNo guitar solos or shredding. I thought this was supposed to be like the old Stratovarius? Totally dissapointing !
4,The Sermon of All Creation: Christians on Nature,This book is a collection of quotes from people of all or no particular faith with nice color photos every other page. It wasn't filtered for a particular brand of Christianity- a good mix and variety of views about nature.
5,A Must have Book For Mom's With Daughters,I read a copy of this book at my friends house one evening. I enjoyed it so much and know my daughter will too. I am a teacher and shared with the girls in my class a chapter from this book. All wanted to know where to get a copy of this book. I am ordering another copy just to have to share with others.
2,Erland! Oy!,"After the first track, this album goes downhill fast. Or should I say downhill slow, since the drum machine catches a cold in from track two on, and all we're left with is a bunch of songs with minimal tunes performed at a glacial pace. I liked his last solo album, but he needs to try harder from now on."
5,Incredible,"Wow, is this ever a cool CD. Noe Venable has quite a unique voice, though someone I played this for thought it was Mazzy Star. I don't really see that, but I suppose if you're going to be compared to someone Hope Sandoval is not bad!She gets us right out of the gate with title track, ""Boots"" which is a stunning song. It's got a great low drum beat, that's barely there, but so powerful. The eerie backing vocals are chill inducing""Prettiness"" makes great use of the light picking on the guitar and her voice floating over the top is sublime. She'd probably hate that I say the song is pretty, but it is. I love it when artists take a sound and then put words to it that are disparate. This is a lovely flowing song but the lyrics start out:She utilizes this method quite frequently, actually. The music is gorgeous, the lyrics almost harsh, a beautiful combination.Well, I won't go over every song because they're all gems.If intelligent atmospheric ""pop"" is your cup o' tea pick this one up."
5,Heavenly Angelic voice is sure to win big with all!,"Last night, I saw Noe open for Ani Difranco in Ames, IA. I immediately bought this CD and have been listening to it ever since. The CD is amazing in itself, but nothing beats seeing her trio perform live. The melodies and her voice are sure to put anyone at ease because they are SO CALMING! Pop this one in when you're ready to relax and kick back. There are a few faster songs with amazing beats; the majority are ballads. ""Boots"", the title track, is by far my favorite so far. If you have the chance to see her trio live, don't let it pass you by! You'll regret it after hearing this amazing girl sing!"
1,not Original,"I received like a copy disc.My friend has original'CD, to compare with the eye CD label is'different.And photo is like a copy.Sound is no good."
2,NOT for everyone...,"OK... like most golfers have figured out, trying to turn every swing into the same cookie-cutter swing (which unfortunately is the trademark of many teaching pros) is just not a great approach for everyone. Parts of this ""tool"" are helpful for the beginner, including the grip setter, and basic alignment, others less so.However...to really get the clubsetter to ""click"" in the backswing, requires a backswing that for most people may be FAR too swift, encouraging a quick overall shot.Slowing the swing down, and accelerating through the swing is a far more accurate way to bring down your handicap, and control your shots (which ironically, is supported by Leadbetter in some of his more advanced videos). Watching the pros, there are very few who have a quick backward snap in their backswings... smooth...tempo... Fred Couples style is a far better backswing to emulate in my humble opinion!"
1,Totally misled,"I ordered and received this item through The Golf Warehouse. It arrived and I immediately saw a defect,in that the magnetic balls would not release correectly, even with major force. I contacted the Golf Wrehouse and they told me to return the item to them. I requested a refund but they refused this saying the item showed signs of use and returned it to me. Since then I have tried to contact David Leadbetter's organization but without any success. I am desperately unhappy about this purchase and, in particular, the after sales service.Derek Price Toronto, ON"
2,wishful thinking,"Nothing beats a good golf lesson, and this certainly doesen't qualify as a good learning tool or golf lesson. Infomercials are very seductive, and once again, I feel like a fool using this tool. The basics of the golf swing are not here, nor is this a strengthening tool. In principle it seems useful and one might think helpful, but it is not. Very disappointed overall. However, it makes for a good conversation piece. I am sure that David Leadbetter is a great instructor, however, this is of little help! Don't waste the $, see your local pro, or ask David for a personal lesson!"
5,Competitive Family Fun,"For my family, this is the board game of choice! When we gather together for family holidays we look forward to spending the evening with Wordthief. I think it can best be described as a combination of Scrabble and Hearts. Letter cards have points and trump values, and words can be formed and stolen throughout the game. There is a lot of satisfaction from stealing a word and then forming 4 or 5 words from the stolen word! Your opponent loses the points from the word and you get (sometimes) get to multiply your points dramatically!"
5,Great game for the whole family!,"My entire extended family just loves this game. We play it with the kids since you are able to play at your own skill level. The young ones, who are eight and eleven, use words from their vocabulary while learning from the adults. The kids just love to steal the words from the adults! They are so proud of themselves. And we're proud of them too! It's a great way to bring the generations together."
5,The most intriguing and challenging word game!,This is the best word game I have ever played. Its strategy combines the best aspects of Scrabble and of poker. It is much more challenging and engaging than Scrabble. I would recommend this game highly to all.
1,Phony,"This book is - as the author concedes - fiction, extremely loosely based on nothing more than newspaper accounts of the John List murders. It should not be confused with true nonfiction accounts of this story."
5,Review,"I received the book on time. So far, it is working perfectly as an aide to study with in my Health Psychology class. Thank You."
3,Where's Injury Risk Behavior?,"Although the coverage of typical behavioral medicine topics like stress, pain, and chronic diseaseis adequate, INJURY is the leading cause of death to children, adolescents and young adults and is poorly represented in examples and literature. The CDC recently released a bibliography of scientific literature on behavioral science approaches to unintentional injuries (accidents) that lists 800+ scientific articles addressing injury prevention interventions (cdc.gov/injury). This textbook does not discuss these studies or cite case examples of health psychology applied to injury prevention. Chronic disease and pain are not the only maladies helped by health psycholgists."
4,Most comprehensive book out there.,I teach this course and having looked at many books I can tell you that this is the most comprehensive out there. I find the writing style just fine and has been improved much over the editions. If one is looking for the latest and most accurate information than this is the book for you. Health Psychology is a relatively recent discipline so there are not as many textbooks out there. I find this to be the best for my purposes.
2,Only Buy if Required,"Not only are the chapters of Taylor's book of ridiculous length (ch.3 is nearly 40 pages) The information provided as ""case studies"" is dated and boring. My largest qualm with this book is that is extremely repetitive. It's almost like when you have a long paper to write over a topic with little previous research, and you write the same things over and over in different ways just to lengthen it. This book is a great example of that. Some of the info in it is good but there's no need for the repitition. Also, the book is expensive ($124.55 at my university) but is very bland in appearance- No Color! Not even the pictures. Don't buy this book unless you have to."
1,ehh...,"I purchased this book for class. The cover was nice, new, and fairly thin. However, when you open the book, it felt like I was reading column in the newspaper as there was so many words written on ONE page. It took me forever to find what I want to find in the book even after using the index. There was just so many words jammed in one page that it did not amuse me to even read it. But I guess that's why the book was not thick or heavy. I should have purchased this book as an online book instead."
4,it was very good,it was very good n the book came in on time.the book was in the condition stated.i would definately buy from this buyer again
3,Not Working,I just ordered this software assuming that i was going to get the palm expansion card. I needed that instead because my computer wont sync the information on my palm. The description said it was a card not a cd. I tried contacting the seller but i got no respond
3,Worth the read,"Although I found the writing in this book a little disjointed and at times too statistical, the book was helpful in opening my eyes to what children need for sleep. I found the principles easy to follow but the book fell short on the actual strategies. It does give you the options (e.g. extinction, check and console, etc.) so that you as a parent can make your choice of what works for you, but I still had a lot of questions with how far to go with any one of those strategies. The most useful part of the book for me were the stories from parents as they helped me realize I am not the only one and change can happen. My boy is now just 9 weeks and sleeping much better. As a consequence so am I. I continue to read and re-read the sections for the next age group to help arm myself with the knowledge to continue to make sleep easier for my son. Overall, the book is worth the time to read and is even better when mixed with other publications."
5,Amazing Results!,"This book is totally amazing & the results fantastic. After several months of allowing our 7 month old to sleep in our bed, I knew I had to break the habit because I was not getting any sleep! I bought this book per our pediatricians recommendation. After only 3 nights of incorporating Dr. Weissbluth's technique, our son was sleeping through the night (12 hours), in his crib, without waking up. If he does wake up, he is now able to put himself back to sleep within 10 minutes.This ""technique"" might not be for everyone, but have an open mind & try it. You will be amazed how quickly your baby learns."
1,Waste of time,"I thought this guy said the same thing ten different ways and offered nothing better than Ferber. I much preferred Ferber's book although neither author convinced me to let my daughter ""cry it out"""
1,Some terrible advice!,"The author advocates letting your baby cry until he learns to sleep on his own. He also suggests: ""A crib tent (for preventing your child from getting out of the crib, it allows you to remove yourself from his protest crying)"" His response to ""Do I ever lock my child in her room?"" ""...Maybe the answer is a stiff door hook."" He suggests that if you can't let your baby cry you may be suffering from ""Working mother's guilt."" Just another version of the Cry it Out philosophy. Sorry. Not for me or my baby."
2,Informative,I bought this book on a recommendation because I was having trouble getting my child to sleep. As I was reading the book I found myself appalled by the practices this author was suggesting. If you are all for the cry it out method in any shape or form this is by all means the way to go. I wouldn't recommend this book.
2,It was ok...,"This book only offers a little bit of advice at a time based on how old your baby is. With a newborn I only read up to 1-2 months and that was only 1/5 of the beginning of the book. I would've like to have read more when I got it. Overall, I guess good advice, but nothing you don't get from weekly emails from hospital and parenting websites."
4,I love sleep,"I am actually still reading, but so far so good. My sister heard great things about the book as well and wants to borrow it when I'm done to help her with her little ones."
1,An insult to all mothers,"I'm always surprised that most of these sleep books are written by men who do not have any of the nurturing hormones or behaviors deeply ingrained in them like moms do. Especially moms who are breastfeeding. Our hormones will not permit us to let our babies cry for even 1 minute! MOMS - Beware of books (by men)that tell you what you *should* do. These quick-fix solutions are all just variations of the old cry-it-out method. Congrats - you've learned to shut your kid up, but at what cost?!?! If you don't want to deal with this, don't have a child. Yes, it's frustrating when your baby won't sleep but that's how kids were designed. Quick fix solutions at the child's expense are cruel and short-sighted. The scare tactics of what will happen to your baby if he misses a nap are ridiculous. Don't let your children cry. It's cruel. Babies will get all the sleep they need, in their own way and on their own terms."
1,Just because you have an MD doesn't mean you know everything...,"Dear Mark, ""Kiss and hug your baby, shut the door and don't come back until morning, even if she cries for an hour."" How would your wife feel if you did that to her? How would you feel if that was done to YOU? Babies aren't as literary proficient as you, dear Mark. They communicate their distress by crying, not writing a dissertation. Shut the door and don't come back til morning? I'd have Family Services and children protection people at your door so fast, bringing you up on charges of neglect."
3,"Sleep, Sleep, Sleep","No need for letting a baby cry. Lots of need for structered naps. Why not look a little at nutrition and a little at spirituality? The ""Dr."" comes from a ""doctor's"" point of view. Native Americans used cradleboards that rocked the child naturally to sleep while suspended from a branch. Sounds archaic. Some new-agers use essential oils and diffuse ""Gentle Baby"" or ""Peace and Calming."" I read, ""Forget The Cures, Find The Cause,"" and learned about the body, mind, and spirit of my children. They all sleep now, and so do I. I wish the doctors that write these books, Weisbuth especially, would do a little research they profess to be good at, and learn a more holistic approach to children's health, and for that matter, ours."
1,How to torture your baby manual,"New parents, please take this book with a grain of salt. I suggest checking out Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems by Richard Ferber before resorting to Weissbluths cold turkey methods. I tried Weissbluth first with my 6 month old baby and it was terrible and unsuccessful. I then tried Ferber's more humane approach and was successful. Besides not having great success with Weissbluth's methods I also do not like the tone he uses when writing about nursing mothers. Sleepless parents, hang in there. It will get better."
2,Too rigid,"This book contains interesting information, but I found his approach to be too rigid for my baby. He advocates one approach for all babies, which I think is unrealistic. I tried this approach for a couple of days with great difficulty. I called my pediatrician and she said many parents get frustrated with this book because they try to follow his advice of naps every 2 hours, etc. and it doesn't work for many babies. She suggested Ferber's book, which I am now ordering."
1,Short term thinking,"This book charms the new parent who is desperate for sleep. But ""sleep at any cost"" is purely the wrong way to approach raising your child. Yes I think that any baby left to cry in the crib will sooner or later fall asleep and will learn that no one comes so why bother to call out. But I think that is what parents are for - to be there for their children day AND night not just when it is convenient or easy. The methods in this book are straightforward even when he tells you not to clean up your baby if he vomits lest you damage the progress of sleep training. The baby stage is very short and I don't want to look back at this time and think that I took the selfish route just for a few hours of sleep. A better and more loving approach is outlined in The No Cry Sleep Solution. I think you should check them both out before you decide if you want to sleep train your baby OR work with your baby's natural rhythms to gently help him learn to sleep better."
1,False Hope,All the wondersful stories in this book gave us hope that we too could have a sleeping baby. It didn't work for us.
1,BEWARE- Baby Training at it's worst!!!,"This book is NOT for all the compassionate parents out there who believe an infant deserves RESPECT. What this guy recommends is child abuse - no time limit on crying at night!The sleep research in this book is worth reading. He is right on target with the science behind sleep, but the techniques he recommends to get a child to sleep are disgusting."
5,This book gives you just enough back up to help you sleep train your baby quickly.,"A wonderful intro into the sleep life of your new baby. Really helped us to understand, and get over our guilt of letting her cry to sleep. I have bought this for other parents as well. Wonderful baby shower gift! UPDATE; It is also a great tool for people with older kids who have not developed good sleep patterns. Everyone I have bought it for, has bought a copy for someone else they know!"
2,"He set out to write a book, but rambled instead","This book is a rambling, self-aggrandizing mess. When he's not puffing himself up, he spends all of his time trying to convince you that naps and sleeping are good.I ALREADY AGREE, THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT THE BOOK. TELL ME SOMETHING USEFUL INSTEAD.I have no idea where the ""step-by-step program"" is located, but it's not between the covers of this book."
5,Must read,I read this and Baby wise and my daughter not only was sleeping through the night at 8 weeks but always happy. She knows how to put herself to sleep instead of relying on me or a bunch of props. This book realy explains why sleep is so important for the growth and developement of your child!
1,"Tired, Busy Parents Don't Want a Ph.D. Thesis","This book, a gift sent by a family member, is thoroughly impractical for tired parents. At nearly 500 pages, with a full bibliography of scientific research, it serves a useful purpose--for the health professional, not the parent. I am a parent, a teacher, and am studying towards my goal of a Ph.D. I simply do not have the time to read through the exhaustive information for the important tips, which are not usefully presented in any case."
1,Not for caring parents of High needs or fussy babies,"First off, this book is boring and difficult to enjoy reading. Next, the author is insultive to babies who fall into his category of Highly fussy/Intense temperment. He calls parents of these ""unlucky"" and that these children will most likely only respond to the cry it out method. Shame on both counts! It may be difficult to parent these children at times due to a lack of parental resources. However, telling parents they are unlucky to have a child like this is certainly not going to help them rise to the occasion. These children can successfull learn to sleep gently and with love as they mature. Plus, they truly do bring out the best parent in you if you yield to what is needed. Parents of truly fussy or high needs babies this book is not for you. Maybe for the placid baby your friends have, but not you! Beware, and save your money!"
4,He's sleeping 11-12 hours!!,"I love this book. It gives good common sense advice. It is so easy to forget that our children need naps when we have playgroups, baby yoga and chores to do. I did not follow the book by the letter but I found it extremely helpful. I would highly recommend it. It gave me the permission I needed to put my child to bed without feeling guilty that we weren't playing for hours when I got home from work."
2,Disorganized,"The author's advice seems to be focused around letting your baby sleep as much as possible, and never ever disturbing him/her when sleeping. Followed by lots of anecdotes about how this has worked for parents. Though useful, this strikes me as advice that most parents don't really need, and doesn't merit such a long book. There's no real system suggested here that I could discern ... other than putting your child to bed early and not disturbing them. However, I did not make it to any of the sections about special situations, which I understood from a friend were useful to them."
5,Best sleep book,"I love this book. It is the one and only one book I think every parent should read. Dr. Weissbluth is very woman/mom friendly (rather than into constant mom-sacrifice), and I give this book to every new mom I know."
2,Must be useful info in here.......if only I could find it!,"I think there are some good and surprising statistics in here about how much sleep children need and what will happen if they don't get it. However, I just cannot wade through this man's writing and come up with a good game plan for getting my daughter to sleep. I've had this book a few months and revisit it from time to time, but his writing is just too circuitous for me to decipher. I have no doubt he can probably help me, but this book needs desperately to be revised by a good editor who can help it make more sense!Boo also to some of his antiquated notions about babies manipulating their parents. Please don't go at child rearing with this notion."
5,Every Parent Must Have!,"LOve this book, been getting for shower gift for years. Every parent needs that gentle reminder that it's ok and this book gives you first hand accounts of other parent's experiences along with expert advice."
5,Great advice in here,My daughter's first child so she wants to get her baby off to a good start. She has used so much of the advice from this book. Highly recommend it.
3,Good ideas for older children but not infants.,"I thought it was a little difficult to obtain what I was looking for. The answers, if I could find them at all, seemed to be on several different pages. I was trying to find how to get a 4 weeks old baby to go to sleep at night and the book never did answer the question. I chalked it up to the fact that the baby was just too young to be considered in this book. It surely would have been nice though to have had some help. It is great for children nearly a year old and over."
2,"did it say let the child cry, but not to let him scream?","I was never able to let my baby cry for a long time. DR. Sear's book did not help me solve any problems but to accept the problem. I was so tired all the time and my marriage was falling apart. Out of desparation, I finally followed the quick-fix the book suggested and let my baby cry for as long as it would take instead of following the Ferber method. My baby became more persistant and more awake after crying for hours. During the day, he became so insecure because he was afraid that I would leave him without going to him. When it comes to bed time or nap time, he screamed at the sight of his crib. I let my baby cried for several days, and finally regret it because I started seeing the sad look in his face. It took us a while to go back to the previous night-waking pattern. Not the greatest, but at least there's no letting the child scream."
1,Yuck.,"This book turns my stomach. Someone gave it to me, and I wish they hadn't. It feeds on a first time mom's insecurities and makes you feel like if you don't let your baby cry it out, then you are a bad parent setting your child up for a lifetime of troubled sleep. This book gave me so much anxiety because it goes against every instinct as a mother. Finally I got confident enough to throw it away and trust myself! It is normal and healthy for babies to wake up at night to nurse! This book is cruel and the advice and ""success"" stories make me feel nauseas. Better to read ""The No Cry Sleep Solution"" for loving ways to help your baby sleep for longer stretches."
1,Awful! Poorly organized and unrealistic.,"This book was recommend by a few friends, so I thought it would be a good book to read. As I started to read the book, I found it to be poorly organized. It was not broken down by age, so one minute it would be telling you how to get a 6 week old to sleep and then it would jump to a one year old. This book also suggests putting your child to bed at 6pm. For working parents, that is not only unrealistic, it is also veryunfair. Am I not supposed to spend any time with my daughter? It goes on to imply that if you don't put your child to bed that early because you want to spend more time with your baby, you are selfish. These are sacrifices that good parents make. To be honest, I stopped reading at that point, and if it wasn't an e-book, I would have thrown it in the garbage!!!"
2,Too much research jargon and cry-it-out endorsement,"I bought this book truly hoping it would help my son sleep better, and the reviews I read led me to believe that Weissbluth isn't a proponent of just letting your baby ""cry it out"". However, after reading the whole book (which was like torture, full of information and medical research an overtired mom doesn't have energy for) it truly seemed like Weissbluth believes the only way a baby can fall asleep is to cry it out or have controlled crying. Besides being difficult to use due to the dense and boring nature of the writing, it didn't help me get my son to sleep better. I highly recommend you go buy the Baby Whisperer or No cry sleep solution immediately!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This book has one basic message that is found all over the internet and in other books. Yet most of the book is a bunch of stories written by other parents and their experiences with their kids. Personally, I dont care what other parents are doing. Its not a one size fits all approach. I am also sick of these authors acting as if they invented this concept of nap time. Argh. It sort of demeans us as parents as if we are ignorant to our babys needs. He also employs the cry it out method.Go with your intuition."
3,"Some useful points, but too repetitive","This book does talk about some important points about sleep. But as other reviewers have mentioned it is poorly written with a lot of repetition and disorganized contents. I feel that most of the information can be summarized in about 50 pages. The stories and case studies, which are supposedly written by parents of sleep-troubled children, always include some sort of praises for Dr. Weissbluth's method. This makes me feel that this book was more likely written as a marketing tool for his practice."
2,Rambles,"Felt like I already tried the stuff in this book, and the author kind of rambles on about one method...I was looking for direct and helpful methods...don't want to read a novel as a sleep deprived new parent with a fussy baby."
3,"Good tips, but so poorly written","This book contains a lot of good information, but good luck finding it! This book is way too long and poorly organized. It's like it was published without an editor.The guidance in this book was helpful for our family, so 3 stars."
1,Just get to the point!,"I found this book to be wordy, confusing, and redundant. Maybe it was because I started reading it after my baby was born."
2,Worthless,"This book was very unhelpful for me. It didn't really offer any solutions and kept referring to babies with colic, which is not an issue for us. It was hard to follow, and just really useless."
5,A Must Read,I read several baby sleep books when our baby was 3 months old . This is the best book and only one you will need to sleep train your baby. Worked great for our baby. A must read for new parents!
1,Cry It Out Method Under Another Title,"This book is just another description of the cry it out method. In one section the author recommends that you should let your baby cry for up to an hour without responding. That's pretty shocking. If you are not interested in doing that to your child, and this mother certainly wasn't, then don't buy this book because it has little else to offer than an even more cruel version of Dr Ferber."
1,Amazon mixed up editions,I actually like this book and recommend it (although it does need better editing). The problem is that Amazon mixed up the edition dates and I can't find the more current edition listed as a product on Amazon. I own the THIRD EDITION (2003 paperback) with 503 pages. Amazon put the picture of the 3rd with the dates and page numbers of the 2nd (only 345 pages!). I ordered 2 good used copies for my friends - one was just like mine and one was this 10-year-old shorter version! The second book matches the picture posted by a customer. THESE 2 EDITIONS ARE VERY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS SOLD AS THE SAME. I would like to know what I'm buying from Amazon in the future...
1,Damaging to Children,"This book suggests that parents let their children cry so hard that if they throw up, it's par for the course. He even suggests that if your baby throws up after crying out for you, that you should just clean it up *but to make sure not to pick the baby up. I don't care how sleep deprived I am, I will never be allowing my child to cry so hard that he throws up. I'd rather spend some time and help my child sleep with more gentle methods."
3,It helps for certain things,"Our son sleeps well on his own, during the night. But during the day he is fussy and rarely sleeps for more than 2 hours at a time. He is almost 3 months. This book helped us figure out a routine in his schedule, and gave us confidence to be aware of his needs, but be firm in our desire to help him sleep better."
3,"slow book, good advice","This book has a lot of good advice, but I think it is a bit slow. I would rather read less about other people and have Dr.Weissbluth get to the heart of the advice. Overall better to read the book and skim rather than not read it."
4,Some interesting advices,I def learned a lot about sleep and applied a few advices that actually work. But the book is poorly written which makes it a pain to read. Everything could fit in 20 pages! But it's a good read if you are having trouble with your baby sleep.
2,Not quite what I had in mind....,"After being directed to this book, I have a somewhat mixed review. I liked the fact that this book details the sleep cycles and habits of most children, through the months of the first year and beyond. He does a good job explaining why babies and toddlers sleep the way they do. However, I feel that this is more ""biased"" than I originally thought. As a new mom of a 4 month old little girl, I do not personally identify with CIO methods. This book seems to lean more toward CIO methods as the ones that ""work."" While they may in fact ""work"" for some people, I do not believe in letting my baby cry-it-out at this point. So while this book gave me helpful sleep related information, I would recommend Elizabeth Pantley's ""No Cry Sleep Solution"" if you don't prefer the CIO methods."
5,The *best* book on your child and sleep by far.,"We bought two books on children's sleep habits when our baby was a newborn. While they all made sense, this book was the one that we decided to follow. Everything happened exactly as the book predicted and worked out great. Our baby started sleeping through the night and taking regular naps at two months. His bedtime has been 6:30 since then and he goes right to sleep most nights. He's a year old now and we're still following the advice in this book.Our experience could be a quirk, but we've recommended this book so many times to friends and gotten great feedback. We also give it as a gift now to new parents.We highly recommend this book."
5,Great for solving toddler sleep problems!,"I love this book for toddlers (one year plus). We co-slept with our daughter until that age, then moved her into her own crib. I'm not sure we could have done it without this book. This book is excellent for sleep problems with toddlers, absolutely amazing.Our daughter refused to stay in her big girl bed until we established a system of sleep rules and rewards. The sleep rules we have chosen are: 1. stay in bed 2. be quiet 3. close your eyes 4. go to sleep. Our daughter gets a cookie every morning if she followed the sleep rules. Same deal (an additional small treat) if she stays in her bed until morning.I would not use this book for infants unless you are prepared to let your baby cry it our for hours."
4,Use your own judgement,"I read the 1 star reviews and I think those parents are missing the point. I knew we had a problem when our daughter would cry as soon as you put her down and then as soon as you walked in the room to check on her she would laugh and smile. That told me that nothing was wrong with crying at night, she was fed, changed and warm. She just did not want to go to sleep. I will tell you trying to achieve the 15 hours of sleep a day for our daughter is very difficult-she doesn't nap well. But the doctor is right sleep begets sleep! When she sleeps well at night she naps better. When she naps well she sleeps better at night."
5,Changed Our Baby's Sleep Habits in Days,"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby changed our lives in a matter of days. When I started to understand my 3 month old child's sleep cues, she was napping three times a day as well as sleeping 12 hours at night with one night feeding. She easily falls asleep in her crib, and as a mom, I have learned that I cannot always be on the ""go"" and expect her to have a restful sleep in the car or stroller. Our family is better rested and happier!"
1,One size fits all doesn't work.,"The problem with this book is that it offers assurances that if you just follow the rules things will work. Well, I did that and nothing worked. Instead, I got hours on end of screaming and felt like a terrible person."
2,"Works for some, not for us","This book came highly recommended by friends. I found the format to be non-user friendly (very difficult to do a quick reference of something, basically needing to do an in depth read every time) and a bit guilt based (you should do it right from day one ... too late for me!).We really did try the suggestions for nap times, which did not work and resulted in no day time naps and waking up every hour at night. The book does not allow for the child that is truly stubborn enough to keep crying. There is no suggestion to allow for how many HOURS of crying cross the line from helping your child to torturing your child.This book asserts that the method will work for every child, which is the only unforgivable part. There is no such thing as one size fits all, and this didn't fit us even giving it a solid effort and seeking additional support from the website."
2,Barely readable,"Dr. Weissbluth may have great insights on infant sleep, but you won't be able to tell what they are from this book, which is poorly written and poorly organized. For my money, Richard Ferber's book is a lot more understandable."
1,Get Ferber's book,"Weissbluth's book is poorly orgainized, wordy, and hard to read. It comes across as preachy despite attempts to cite academic sources. Besides that, it didn't work for us (and many others). ""Why is my baby so different from all these mentioned in this book?"" I wondered. I expected to hear her cry for 3-7 nights and then sleep well...SHE DID (for about a night...then we were back in the same boat for another week...then another)! Besides that, some of the ideas are ridiculous, to me (eg putting your child to bed for a super early bedtime when necessary). I would NEVER consider putting my child to bed before 6pm again, but for some reason, under Dr. Weissbluth's persuasion, even tried this b/c of his ""sleep begets sleep"" philosophy. If you read this book, you start thinking all babies need 12 hours of sleep at night + 2 2 hour naps. BULL!! What finally worked? Ferbers method--mostly because of his more realistic expectations of how much a baby SHOULD be sleeping."
3,Our twins are great sleepers thanks to his theory,"our nieces were trained this way and as non-parents it didn't make a lot of sense. After our twins were born, I lived by his theory and i'm happy to report that our 3 1/2 year old twins still take nap time daily and are usually in bed by 7pm at night. I recommend this book to all parents, a well rested child is truly happier!"
1,Poorly written & badly structured,"My wife and I each bought copies of this book separately with a view to helping to establish healthy sleep patterns for our 3-month old. We both found the book to be very poorly written. Weissbluth jumps from place to place, idea to idea, in a very rambling fashion, without ever really getting to the point. It's as though he has dictated the text to a dictaphone, had someone type it up, and never read it back. The only idea of value I have gleaned from the book is to put the baby to bed at 6pm rather than 8pm. No doubt there are other pearls to be discovered by sifting through the book, but it is so badly written that the sifting becomes very hard work indeed."
1,"Disappointing, made things worse.","We had a couple of recommendations for this book since my 2 year old son has never slept all night and will only fall asleep by nursing him or driving him around. This book set us back - way back. Before trying this ""cry it out"" method, I had my son almost completely weened from nursing. I approached the method open minded and tried it the way he recommends. Now my son is clingy and wants to be nursed constanly, he is scared to death of his crib and won't even go into his bedroom. He has never been so insecure. We feel as though we have broken his little spirit. The scientifics on why sleep is necessary makes perfect sense, however, the method is too cruel for us. The author does contradict himself over and over as stated in other reviews. I'll keep searching for a gentler approach to our problem as I do not believe letting a child cry himslef to pure exhaustion is the way to go."
5,Finally...sleep,"I was getting up 6 to 8 times a night and had an over the top baby all day. This book helped me identify the problem, bad sleep habits. It was time to become a parent and solve the problem for my tired baby. This book showed us how to do that in only 3 nights and now she sleep 12 hours a night (9 months old) and is sooooo happy during the day."
5,Well Rested Mommy,"This book is awesome! I can't say enough good things. It took no time at all before our then 3 month old was on a great sleep schedule. She is now 7 months old and is very happy. She loves naptime and bedtime. When I tell other parents what a good sleeper we have they are always very envious! I tell them it didn't just happen, we worked at it. Believe me, it is worth the effort!"
2,Lots of crying involved,"Here's a quote from the book ""If we place an arbitrary limit on the duration of crying at night, we train our child to cry to that predetermined time. When it is open-ended, the child learns to stop protesting and to fall asleep."" Well, sure. Have you ever cried yourself to sleep? Exhaustion and agony work. This requires a hard heart and lots of crying. He also says ""We are leaving him alone to forget the expectation to be picked up."" We are talking about a BABY here, a baby who deserves and needs to picked up and should expect to be picked up. I'm sorry that I started with this book, I'm glad I moved on to one that is more compassionate and loving: The No-Cry Sleep Solution. A better more peaceful NO CRY way."
2,Rambles on and on,"The material in the book is poorly presented. He seems to say a lot of things, none of them very well; you keep wondering when he is going to get to the point. The sleep theory is not presented nearly as well as in Richard Ferber's books. The solutions are substantially harsher - and they may not work because he doesn't address the entire range of common sleep problems. He jumps from idea to idea without giving it serious considerations.For example, he has a section which addresses a common problem: a child won't go down for a nap. Solution? Don't drag him around shopping malls. No, seriously, is that the only reason a child might resist a nap?!The whole book is kind of like that. I highly recomment Ferber over this guy."
2,"Some utility, but poorly presented","Weissbluth has some valid information to convey based on his research and years of practice. However, the writing is so poor that it is very difficult to get the goods. Sentences are often long and ambiguous due to fuzzy modifiers. Several phrases like ""or several weeks later for infants born prematurely"" are repeated far too often. Organization of chapters is deceptively sensible, but the contents of each chapter often contain paragraphs that belong in other chapters, leaving the reader confused as to whether the recommendations apply to the featured age group. Chapters contain client vignettes that are often inserted in places having nothing to do with the preceding or subsequent paragraphs, adding to the confusion. Though I was able to ferret out a few useful points to help me with my baby girl's sleep habits (3 months), in general I would recommend that you look for another book that can skillfully convey the information you seek."
1,Please. PLEASE read No-Cry Sleep Solution or Ferber's book instead!!!,"Let me give you the entire content of the book:Let your baby cry until she gives up on her parents ever coming to her aid. Repeat as necessary.There is a little useful information about nap schedules (Save yourself the money - 3 hours between naps for 12 months and under) The rest is a bunch of charts and graphs that I'm sure most people skip, plus case histories of babies who wake up ""happy"" after being allowed to cry for hours on end.This is a TERRIBLE book. I am sad to think how many parents are buying it and using the author's bad advice. I would give it 0 stars, but that wasn't an option."
1,Just because he's an MD....,"doesn't mean he knows a thing about child psychology. Apparently he knows so little, he doesn't even know how unqualified he is to comment on the topic. I only have a B.S. in psychology, but nothing I learned in any of my social pyschology or development classes support what he touts in this book.And as a parent, I can't even fathom the kind of emotional neglect Weissbluth advocates. I know that as parents we get desperate for sleep. We'd consider just about anything to get the kid to sleep. But considering and doing are very different things. Don't let a short term problem (difficult sleep) have long term effects by taking rash action that will emotionally injure your baby. I recommend Elizabeth Pantley's No Cry Sleep Solution over this parent-centric garbage."
2,Good information if you can get through it...,This book is not well written. It has some good information but everything useful would have fit into just one chapter. The book repeats and repeats in an disorganized way with useless personal stories from real families. I am sure he is a very good doctor but it is clear he is not an effective writer.
2,Don't waste your money,I have a fussy two month old and a friend recommended this book so I bought it. I found that the techniques and information is the same as anything you can find online for free. The only reason I would purchase this is if I didn't have regular internet access. Otherwise don't waste your money.
5,My Sleeping Bible,"This book has been incredibly helpful to me in learning about the sleep needs of kids. While I don't find the anecdotes to be particularly helpful (if you start early enough with these tactics, you never end up in the bad situations that are highlighted), the guides around how sleep patterns develop and when to begin to train your kids have been very helpful. Both of my kids (who are very different personality wise and sleep wise) began sleeping through at 6-7 weeks and have been great sleepers ever since.I think this book offers a great balance between what kids need and what parents need to have a happy family situation overall. I have recommended this book to every new family and everyone uses it a little bit differently. I think that is what makes this better than any of the ""one size fits all"" books of sleep theories."
2,Very confusing chapter breakups - too hard to use as a reference,"This book is very confusing (and I have been a book editor in the past)! The chapters for say months 1-4 include discussion about 8 month olds and jump around from age to age. Also there is no ""strategy"" page for each age group so a parent can turn to the book quickly to learn what to do. I hate reading this and i know of several others who agree, claiming it is about as understandable as reading a instruction manual for a stereo translated from japanese to english. the tenets of the book are spot on of you have the power to get through it, but because it is so all over the place i would not recommend this book. ferber's book is more concise and more understandable"
1,Not for worrywarts,"I bought this based on a friend's recommendation but find it incredibly frustrating. The book is littered with blackbox warnings about all of the ways your subtle mistakes can brain-damage your child. Sometimes these dictates contradict the text. On two separate pages, large warnings tell us ""NEVER wake a crying baby."" But copy between those pages instructs us to ""wake your baby in the morning in order to establish an age-appropriate midmorning nap that is needed to set the sleep scheduleThe tone here is annoyingly dogmatic; it's as if there is only one way to address sleep problems: Dr. Weissbluths.The real shame is that I'm sure there's some good information here, and I would love to read an approach other than Dr. Sears' (I love the Sears' baby book; I just want a second opinion). But the last thing an exhausted, anxious parent needs is this kind of poorly edited, one-sided fear mongering."
5,book,mom's love this book. I have one friend who gives it as a gift to first time moms. Nice shower baby gift
5,Best book,"I had a 5 1/2 month old who was still waking up every 2 hours throughout the night and hardly napping. This book helped me tremendously! I followed the advice EXACTLY as it was given and within a week I had a happy, sleeping child! He is now 14 months old and I still refer to it as he grows and his schedule changes. I love, love this book and will use it with my next baby!"
1,"Not for those who do not believe in ""cry it out""","Save your money if you do not believe in ""cry it out"" method. We did not believe in this for our baby."
5,Helpful Guidelines,"Although this book does not provide concrete answers that will work for every child, I found it extremely helpful in providing basic guidelines. As a new mother this book was a good resource for me and I was able to adapt to my daughter's individual needs while also understanding the basics of sleep patterns. Our daughter is now one year old and is a great sleeper, both for naps and at night. Before reading this book I spent a lot of extra time trying to ""figure it out"" and after reading the book felt educated enough to make decisions that worked for our family."
3,"Good methods, too much information","I think Dr. Weissbluth has much good advice in this book (of course, that depends on your child). From my reading, books on children's sleep are very different-a book can only espouse one idea, after all. If you are a fan of sleep methods such as attachment parenting, you may not agree with all of the methods presented in this book. However, I feel, personally, that it's a great idea to read up on many different sleep methods until you find that which suits your family.As a user's guide, I found this book to contain too many scientific studies and background information. I'm a scientist myself, so it's not that I don't appreciate this information, however, I was looking for practical advice and tips on how to get my infant on a better sleep schedule, and all of the theory presented in this book was a bit much. I would have appreciated a more concise user's guide to sleep schedules."
4,Only crying to sleep [olutions,"The author really knows what he is talking about. I like that his opinions are research-based. However, when you are a mom it is hard to let your child cry to sleep, whatever the ""experts"" say. I was looking for a no cry sleep solution. At the beginning it was helpful because I understood my baby's sleep patterns. But when my baby got to his 10th month and was still waking up every three hours at night the only alternative I found in this book was to let him cry. I was disappointed because that was something I didn't want to do. I found another book The No Cry Solution where I learned other strategies more related to my kind of parenting. I guess you can take advantage of the information on how baby sleep, but if you don't want to let your child cry himself to sleep then you should buy another book for more specific advice regarding no cry sleep solutions."
3,Useful but could have been said in a booklet,"I like the idea of this book, and it was highly recommended by a couple of friends, but felt that each chapter was so repetitive that I could have condensed this book down to a booklet easily and gotten more out of that. I did flag several pages for my husband to read too so at least those pages were the most useful that we can refer to in the future"
3,Confusing Read,I agree and find that this book is very helpful with techniques but it is a very difficult read and poorly organized. Also I feel like it goes over so many statistics that it overwhelms the reader from the beginning. It DID make me feel better about letting my baby cry some to sleep.
5,Best sleep book,"I used Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child for my first baby with great results. I gave my original copy to my sister for her baby and she has also had great success. I ordered it again to reference for my second baby."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE this book,"Marc Weissbluth was my saving grace! He taught me that sleep is good and healthy for my baby and he taught me how to read my baby so he could fall asleep easier. Marc offers real stories from his patients, multiple techniques so you can decide what fits your lifestyle & your baby's personality best and gives pros & cons to each technique as well. He also warns about ways that parents sabotage their efforts to give their child the gift of good healthy sleep and how to change.My son loves to nap now. He loves night time now. He's one and takes 2 good naps and sleeps 14 hours at night. I can't say enough good things about this book. Please give it a try, it is so worth it for your child's health & future sleep habits & for your mental health, sanity & nights sleep.This book saved my sanity, I was so lost before reading it."
4,"great advice, bad editing","This is our first baby, so I don't know if we are lucky or if adequate sleep has made him perfect! He is either smiling and laughing, exploring or sitting in quiet contemplation. But, this book is confusing because it was poorly edited. My advice is to stick with it and revisit it frequently until the basic points make an impression. The biggest problem with this book and philosophy is that once you buy into it, it is unbearable to see over tired children in public. Seeing tired babies out with their parents at 8 and 9pm at a weekly outdoor concert in my town was a total buzz kill."
4,Referred by good sources,Many good friends and professionals referred this book to us. Not just the friends that have no babies ;) but Mom and Dads that have had sleep concerns.
5,"This book worked for us, guided us, and is the primary reason for our happy baby!","We followed this book's advice and used the graduated extinction method, and he started sleeping through the night. Now he's 5 1/2 months old and wakes up once at 5 a.m. to eat--no big deal for me considering what could have happened when I read about other parents' ordeals on blogs, in books, and from what other parents tell me. He is happy, I always get comments on how much he smiles--he's a very smiley baby--and he loves to look around and observe and analyze things. This book is awesome--thank you Dr. Weissbluth!!!"
4,Worked for me!,"A dear friend gave me this book while I was pregnant with my son and preparing my daughter, who was 2, to share her room with her new baby brother.Being a little apprehensive because there was so much information in the book, I first scanned through to her age group and began reading.I applied the principles, beginning with ""the rules.""1. Stay in Bed2. Go to sleep3. Be quietor Mommy will put up the gate (of course it was before she could climb it)I swear it took 4 nights to acheive, but she began staying in her bed and going to sleep without fussing.To this day, nearly 5 years later, she goes to sleep extremely well.I truly believe the main key to any method is consistency.As long as Mom or Dad can stay CONSISTENT nearly any method will acheive the desired result.I still have the book and because of moving into a new area we are going to end up breaking it out to refresh our memories and applying the principles to our son... again, we need consistency!"
3,Who edited this book?!,"This book may be helpful, but who edited this book? The editor needs to be fired!It is terribly long (544 pages!) because it is horribly organized and confusingly written. I can't believe a doctor wrote this book. His grammar and sentence structure are a nightmare! For a parent who is limited on time and may be desperate for sleep, this book can cause you to rip your hair out!It is really a shame because the book does have some good points. Using this book and other sleep books, my 10 week old sleeps through the night and has a solid nap schedule.However, it is written so poorly, it take takes him 500 pages to get to the point! And, he contradicts himself with in the same sentence! It was so frustrating to read, I am so shocked that people love this book! HOW DID THEY MAKE SENSE OF IT? I feel like I've wasted so much of my precious time trying to understand what the heck he's talking about."
4,Happy Parents,A Great Book - Understanding that Babies need tons of sleep and protecting their sleep was the key for us.We have a 13 month old whose BedTime varies from as early as 6:15pm - 7:30pm - but she sleeps for a min of 12 hours at a time - although it means we sometimes have less time with her in the evenings - it is well worth it - She always wakes up Cheery and raring to go!
3,Helpful hints BUT,"My baby has not arrived yet. However, in preparation for her arrival, I started reading this book. My chief complaint with this book is that Dr. Weissbluth scatters the information throughout the book. It is written as though his target audience is other doctors and NOT parents. I have a law degree and reading this book is PURE TORTURE. I feel as though I have to have a highlighter and notepad. In short, this book is not succinct, and I feel as though I have lost tidbits that I have learned throughout the book. He would do well to have an appendix that says ""at months 1-4, do ""x,y,z."" The book may help parents help their children sleep, but you'd need to read it 2 or 3 times to do so."
3,Invaluable Information / Harsh Methods,"WHEN MY HUSBAND AND I BROUGHT HOME AND OUR DAUGHTER, WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE SLEEP NEEDS OF AN INFANT. THIS BOOK PROVIDES INSIGHTFUL RESEARCH AND EASILY APPLICABLE INFORMATION TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR CHILD'S SLEEP NEEDS. FOR THAT REASON ALONE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.ON ANOTHER NOTE, I DISAGREE WITH THE DR'S HARSH ""EXTINCTION"" METHODS. HIS DEFENSE OF HIS METHODS IS SO STRENUOUS, IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE AWKWARD. WE CHOSE A DIFFERENT METHOD THAT GAVE OUR DAUGHTER THE SPACE TO EXPRESS HER FEAR OF SEPARATION, BUT ALSO MAINTAIN OUR CLOSE CONNECTION. AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING THIS METHOD IS AVAILABLE ON THIS SITE: [...]. THIS METHOD TOOK US ABOUT 4 OR 5 NIGHTS - A NIGHT OR TWO LONGER THAN THE ""EXTINCTION"" METHOD URGENTLY PROMOTED BY THE DOCTOR. WE STAYED CLOSE TO OUR DAUGHTER AND WELCOMED HER TEARS UNTIL SHE FIGURED OUT THAT SLEEPING WASN'T SUCH A SCARY THING. AS PARENTS, THIS METHOD SIMPLY MADE MORE SENSE TO US. GOOD LUCK!"
1,"Poorly written, one-size-fits-all. Don't buy this book.","I picked up this book in hopes of finding ideas to help my son nap better during the day. Half way through the book I'm thoroughly frustrated and confused. The book is poorly written, has filler content and is full of contradictions. There's so much junk in this book that I have trouble reading through it and picking out the gems (if there are any). I'm also suspicious of the author's ""research"". It's anecdotal at best. If you look carefully, he uses language like ""I think"" and ""it may lead to.."" which basically means he's just giving his opinion. Don't buy this book!"
1,Confusing and hard to follow if you don't have enough time,"This book offers some good facts about baby sleeping, but as a new parent with limited time, I wish I could have a firm plan that I can try it out. I found this book difficult to follow and confusing for the most part. I wish I had enough time to sit down and read it all and then digest it for another month, and then make out a plan for my baby. In this book, there is no plan or whatsoever, just basic facts and endless warnings. This is not a step by step program to me, this is a pediatrician's notebook on baby sleep. If you do some research or have to take part in a test on baby sleep, this is the right book."
2,no sleep leaves little time to read,"Although I like the premise of the book ""the more a baby sleeps, the more it will sleep"" I found the layout of the book just awful. Obviously if you are reading this book you are likely having some trouble with getting your baby to sleep well which leaves little time for reading long chapters on how to get the baby to sleep. There is far too much statistical data and blab in the book and no enough specific, direct answers or suggestions/steps. Overall just far to wordy."
4,Best sleep book I've read yet,"I read this book over and over. Everytime my child is having a ""sleep issue"" I pull out this book. I read the parts according to his age. This book has helped me get through some hard times."
5,Awesome Book!,"First of all I would like to say that everyone should be open minded and do what works for them. However, this book was a miracle for me. I read it before my little girl was born, but did not put a lot of thought into it. After my little girl was about 1 1/2 months old, I knew something was wrong. She would stay up for hours at a time without sleeping. My mother actually read the book for me (I was too exhausted and frustrated) and helped me begin the process of getting Catherine to sleep. She now takes a morning nap (anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours), an afternoon nap (three hours) and goes to bed anywhere between 6p.m. and 8p.m. She may get up one time at night or sleep through the night. She is also much happier! My life has been changed! Again, do what works best for you but wasting your energy on criticizing the methods that don't work for you."
2,Repetitive. All over the place.,"The book should have been half as long as it is. The author is so repetitive, which makes the book very difficult to read. There are too many stories/analogies. There are too many similar points made in multiple chapters throughout the book. I only found a couple of chapters helpful."
3,Baby sleep review,"The book was OK. It has some good points, like if you are having trouble with your baby sleeping - try putting them to bed earlier. That worked. And that was the only thing I got out of the book. Everything else in it was pretty much common sense. Don't buy new - borrow if you can. Or get it cheap."
3,Daunting size,"I was strongly recommended this book by several other new moms. I was also told to make sure that I read it before the baby is born so that I have time to absorb the material. To be up front, I don't have a baby yet, and thus can't comment on the quality of the recommendations inside. However, I can tell you that there is no way I can read this book now. It is very dry, it is very thick and it is not written in an enticing way. I can't imagine trying to get through it when I'm tired and a baby is crying instead of sleeping. There are some tips highlighted, and there is a trouble shooting section, and the chapters are divided by age. I can see keeping this for future reference if we have a problem, but it's hard to imagine that it will be my go to book."
2,Not terribly helpful for us,"On the positive side, this book does an excellent job of explaining a baby's sleep needs and helped us to realize that our daughter was very sleep deprived. However, other than encouraging us to ""find the window"" of where she first becomes sleepy, this book did little to help us solve the problem. This book is not very well organized and a little bit hard to follow (although I read the digital version which may have contributed to that) All I was looking for was a way to scoot our daughter's bedtime from midnight to a more reasonable 8pm. Unfortunately this book did not give me any good advice on getting her down sooner."
3,Some good advice...,"This book had some good pointers, but I didn't follow it every step of the way. If I had, I would have no life. If you are a parent that is home all of the time this will work well for you. But even the stay-at-home parent has errands to run, etc. No one can keep a baby on such a strict schedule as this Dr. recommends. I suggest taking the advice that he gives and sticking to it the best that you can.Also, if you don't believe in the ""crying it out"" method then don't get this book."
4,great book. helps you make some difficult choices.,"This is a great resource for learning about sleeping patterns in children and what you can do to develop them. It's also good for giving you the courage to do what you know is best, even when your child is crying nonstop for hours at bedtime, for days in a row. We are fortunate to have Dr. Weisbluth as our pediatrician and I thank him everytime I see him for helping us help our child sleep (and for saving our marriage)."
2,"Good science, harsh practice","Yes, sleep is important and this book explains why. However, I must disagree with the 'sleep at all costs' approach of letting a baby cry endlessly until he wears himself out to sleep. Just because he sleeps I don't believe that is solving the base problems. I found a more thoughtful approach to solving the underlying problems that prevent sleep, and more humane solutions, in The No Cry Sleep Solution book by Pantley. I perceive the crying-to-sleep approach as a sort of ""throw your hands up and let the baby figure it out on his own"" approach, and I would rather solve the problems that prevent sleeping and encourage gentle, happy sleep for my child."
3,For Tough-Love Parent Types,"Most couples are divided into two sides--one is more warm and fuzzy, the other is more about discipline. This book is for people who are more discipline-oriented. Like the original book by Dr. Ferber, it advocates taking tough short-term tactics (teaching your baby to cry himself to sleep) to achieve long-term results (a toddler who knows how to sleep through the night. Jury is still out, though--behavior modification is not 100% science. On a lighter note, please read the funniest book ever written about sleep, parenting and the way your life changes when you have kids--""I SLEEP AT RED LIGHTS: A True Story of Life After Triplets,"" by Bruce Stockler. A hilarious true story, very touching and very real--and the best stories on sleep deprivation ever written. A classic!"
4,Dr. W. knows what he is talking about!,"This book was recommended to me by many, many people and my pediatrician told my husband and I that it was one of the more respected infant sleep books in the pediatric community.Read this book and follow it. There were so many specific helpful points in it. It changed our family life for the better. My daughter is so much happier and well rested! She took longer to catch on than many of the examples in the book but the ultimate outcome was the same and she is a great sleeper!I tell everyone I know with a baby about this book!"
4,OK book,This book is OK. I didn't like it as much as the no cry books. I did find some of the information useful.
1,Don't buy this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I tried his method to a tee, by putting our infant to sleep at 4:30-5 p.m. He got so used to it that he can't make it past then. He of course got hungry at 3:30 a.m. and was ready to start the day. Our 3.5 year old didn't wake till 6 a.m., so we of course had no more than 5 hours to sleep. When the kids were sick, we were lucky to get 2 hours of fragmented sleep. We could never hang out at BBQs, as we had to be home at 4 p.m. Even if we did get our son to sleep later, he would still wake at 3:30 a.m. due to learned hunger pangs. I would strongly advise following the advice in this book. If ohly I could go back in time!"
1,Not happy at all...(with the service...),"I am still waiting to get this product !!! The ""due date"" is many days behind me and I'm still anxiously waiting to receive this book !!!! And I'm really not happy about this! My child will learn alone how and when to sleep till I'll get this book!!! :("
5,Follow the Book,It is possible for a baby to refuse sleep because they are overly tired. Following the advice in this book we have been blessed with a sleeping bundle of joy instead of a screaming (well?) bundle of joy.
5,Right-on,"This is the one and only sleep book you need. It proved invaluable with out 2 kids. It replaces the magic and mystery of the sleep habits of children with clear science and common sense. You will quickly realize that most parents handle sleep training quite incorrectly. When we followed this book, everything fell into place. With our 2nd child we found it was taking a while for him to get to the point of sleeping through the last feeding of the night. A quick check back in the book and we corrected things within a couple of days. It is essential to set the right sleep habits as early as possible. If you do, you WILL have healthy, happy children and the ability to boast that your kids sleep right through the night."
3,good book,"good book, everything is good info, just kind of vague on exactly how to achieve the intended result. i would have liked to know more about how to get the babies to sleep along with the schedules... otherwise a decent book."
3,Disappointing,"With so many good reviews, I had high hopes for this book. Overall, there are some good tips on how to manage sleep time, and I have a great little sleeper in my house. However, the author is quite pretentious. This book is written in a way that it reads like ""If you don't do it my way, then you're doing it WRONG!!!"" The hard part is that getting a baby to sleep isn't as easy as following step-by-step instructions. I started to feel bad when I couldn't get my little man to do exactly what the author was saying.With this being said, I think there are a lot of good tips in this book on how to manage sleep. And you'll also find that your baby will settle into a sleep pattern that suits him or her. By using these tips plus your own intuition, I think you'll find a sleeper in your baby too."
2,Confusing!,This book is terribly confusing. The author switches between ages without warning. I makes it hard to understand if the information given is for an older infant or a newborn. This book just needs a better structure.
5,"NOT a ""cry-it-out"" book (despite other reviewers misreadings)","I don't know what book these other readers read - the ones who say the author advocates ""cry-it-out"" or ""ignoring"" the child. He explicitly says that is NOT what he is advocating. In fact he is suggesting quite the opposite - that if you become more aware of and attentive to your child's sleep ""cues"" (like eye-rubbing or yawning) and put them down in time, it should never come to a ""cry-it-out"" situation to begin with. He's advocating being MORE sensitive to your child, not less. If they get to the point where they are screaming (usually whether or not you pick them up), then you have missed the cues and they are over tired. Some of these reviewers need to work on reading comprehension!"
5,BEST BOOK- GUARANTEED to give you a good nights sleep!!!!,"Thanks to this book and the FANTASTIC advice from Dr.Weissbluth my son(3)who used to wake up at 4:00 a.m., now ASKS to sleep until 7:00 a.m.!!!! This book (and his advice)is NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING!! His book/advice has CHANGED OUR LIVES. I began with a son who fought and argued, screamed and cried before bed, to a son who happily goes to bed EVERY NIGHT without ANY fussing -EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. I have personally spoken with Dr.Weissbluth and he is much more than an author, he is the MOST gentle,caring, respected pediatrician I know. -PA"
5,Helpful Advice,"A friend gave me this book and I have since purchased it for 4 of my friends. My son is now almost five and still sleeps 12 hours a night. This book really put the importance of sleep in perspective for me. As a new generation of parents we are always on the go but, we have to remember that a baby's sleep is so important for their physical, emotional and mental health. I highly recommend that all new moms read this book. As an educator I see on a daily basis the results of children with a shortage of sleep."
3,A helpful resource,"I HATE parenting books and I didn't find this one particularly helpful when my child had colic. But, as he's gotten older it has become a nice resource. I follow the general guidelines in a way that fits my child and family. There is no sleep solution or formula that works for every baby and every mother. If there was, everyone would be using it. And anyone who tells you otherwise . . . well, I'll keep those thoughts to myself. It's a good resource, not a miracle solution."
3,Can't finish it...,"I think the advice is probably good, but it's so long and I'm so tired that I can't seem to organize my sleep fogged brain to understand and create a comprehensive sleep plan. Seriously, I have no time to read a book that has charts on a child's sleep patterns. Give me a quick intro, explanation and then lists and bullet-points. I'm tired, baby is tired, please get to the point. By the way Dr.Weissbluth, everyone knows you are an expert in the field (hence the book)- I don't need so many testimonials reiterating how awesome you are."
5,An Excellent Resource for Parents,"I bought this book while I was still pregnant and found the author's advice made sense to me. Unlike the very strict ""Babywise"" and its opposite, the Attachment Parenting approach, this author backs up his advice with numerous scientific studies regarding children and sleep. I began to understand the importance of sleep for my child and vowed to follow the book's guidelines. I found it difficult to let my child ""cry it out"" and took Ferber's recommendation and calmed my son in his crib after 5 minutes. I only needed to do this a couple of times, though, and my 13-week-old son now sleeps 8-9 hours consistently (in addition to 2 long naps a day). This book contains excellent explanations of the following: the importance of sleep, the physical development of your child and how it relates to sleep, and how to foster good sleep habits. I highly recommend this book."
5,lifesaver,"i have not even finished this book yet it has already helped me tremendously. the simple idea of trying to put my 1.5 year old daughter down before she gets overtired has made such a difference. after doing this, it took 15 minutes of crying on night one, 4 minutes on night two, 2 minutes on night three, and straight to sleep after that. putting her to sleep is so much easier and she has added about one hour of sleep at night and has regular two+ hour naps now. of course the book can be repetitive, but it makes sure the info sticks with you! for the next baby, i will start implementing this way before 1.5 years!"
2,Not for a busy parent!,"If you wish to read this book, it may be best to do so before your child is born. It is very wordy and delves into the pathology of sleep, i found i did not have time or the interest to read it. I was hoping for a few good ideas for bedtime and how to get my infant to self soothe. I still don't know if this book delivers as in all fairness i didn't finish it though i did skim through. It is not what i expected."
4,Waking during naps?,"We have found the suggestions in the book extremely helpful and highly recommend it to all (despite poor writing/organization). Our 7-week old is a much much happier camper because of this book!However, we did not find an answer to our remaining problem - waking up after 15 or 30 minutes of napping, still sleepy but crying and unable to fall back asleep.If anyone has found a solution - would you please drop us a line - olyah1@yahoo.com."
5,GET THIS BOOK!,"This book is wonderful! After buying and trying 3 other books on infant sleep problems without success, I was on my last rope when I bought this book. Boy did I wish this was the first book I bought! It was very common sense and practical and worked like a charm in a matter of days for us. We had been struggling since our baby was about 2 months old on sleep problems (no naps, waking up all night) and I bought this book when the baby was 5 months old. Forget the other books and get this one! We're all sleeping well with no crying anymore and my husband and I aren't discussing divorce court anymore...ha ha ha!!!!"
2,Crying it out = Happy Child??,"As a mother of three young children and health professional working with mothers and babies, I would NOT recommend this book for the following reasons:1. His method: leave baby to cry for UNLIMITED periods extinction2. Confusing and conflicting advice.3. The leap of faith between the facts and his method.4. Lack of a coherent strategy.5. Patronizing and condescending tone6. Exhausting to read (almost 500 pages).The book does have some interesting facts about sleep, but in the end, Dr. Weissbluth's ""Trust me, I'm a doctor""-attitude could never convince me to follow his methods. There are gentler ways of helping baby to sleep well!"
1,"might be well researched, but horribly written","For the sleep deprived parent, this book is useless. It is not well indexed, and it is virtually impossible to find information quickly and easily. The author has a rambling style, making it difficult for the not-well-rested parent to read. There is probably good advice in the book, but i couldn't find it. I highly recommend ""THE NO CRY SLEEP SOLUTION"" by Elizabeth Pantley. It is a MUCH better book-- well indexed, concise, and detailed. (And doesn't have to address what to do if your child throws up from crying so much-- it's not part of the method.) Only buy ""healthy sleep habits"" if you have the time to read a 500 page book and have a good highlighter."
1,"Good research, bad approach","Since this is written by a doctor it contains plenty of research. The problem is that this (male) doctor is goal oriented, it's about sleep at all costs. The main thrust of any technique given is to let your child cry until he goes to sleep by himself. Not sure if that is really a solution at all, and it certainly doesn't take into account a child's emotional development. If you are OK with your child crying to sleep then just do it and you don't really need to read a book. If you want solutions that take into account your child's emotions and feelings then I'd suggest The No-Cry Sleep Solution which contains many of the same facts found herein but then goes on to provide many non-crying approaches to sleep."
4,I recommend,"I bought this book out of deperation for solving a developing sleep issue I was having with my 7mth old daughter and I was not dissapointed. Withing a week the problem was solved and she was sleeping like a baby (should!)A good sleep manual for babies over 4 months discussing common sleep problems and how to solve them. I fully recommend this book to everyone!Only thing that would make this book better for children over 4 mths, is to also discuss the less common sleep issues, or to have a contact number to get help if needed.If you have sleep issues with babies under 4 months I strongly recommend ""Secrets of the baby whisperer"" or ""babywise 1"" (the latter is better as if you ring them [Growing Families International] they can also give you the number of a contact mum for further support)."
2,Not impressed-hard to read-not my style,"There is something out there for everyone and this one is not for me. I am familiar with the importance of sleep and basic routines, I have a two year old. BUt this book was of no help to me with my new baby who is 10ks and having frequent night time wakings. Maybe it would be better for a pregnant for the first time mom who has the time and energy to read it."
3,WARNING: You MUST be prepared for your baby to cry (a lot),"This book came highly recommended to me by several parents so I was looking forward to finding a way of helping my 6 month old have longer, more regular naps during the day. Basically, Dr Weissbluth says to put the baby down before they look tired (about 9am and 1pm) and leave them. If the baby cries, you may return to comfort him or her AFTER an HOUR. At this point, I knew the book was not for me: there is no way I can let my baby cry for that long. If he begins crying, he will not sleep. I didn't really feel like I learned anything new in this book and am just not prepared to leave my baby to cry for such a long period of time. Having said that, I know of at least 2 families who have used this method and both say that after a week, their baby was ok and learned to nap without crying. If you are considering this book, I suggest you borrow it first."
5,Very Helpful to a New Parent,"We bought this book on the advice of in-laws and found it to be extremely helpful. First, with a colicky child it told us what we could do and what not to worry about. Perhaps the single most valuable message was that others went though similar experiences; we did not really have a ""problem"". Second, this was our gold standard in teaching our little girl how to sleep. We certainly have a far healthier and happier daughter as a result of such good advice. Besides, our life as parents is better.A very important book for us."
1,Big disappointment,"I was looking forward to finding a good sleep solution for our 8 mo. old son who wakes at least every 2 hours during the night but this was NOT it. Anyone who subscribes to the cry it out method will find a gentler version from Ferber.I guess I'm a softie... How in the world did you allow your child to cry for 2 1/2 hours and not attend to them? If it feels wrong, it's wrong. The fact that a baby sleeps through the night is not proof enough for me that this is a good method. Anyone would eventually fall asleep from exhaustion if they were crying nonstop and no one ever came to comfort them. You'd be afraid, worried and you'd eventually cry yourself to sleep. Any method that tells a parent to go against their instinct is NOT a method for me."
5,Twins starting sleeping through the night at 8 weeks!,"After having twins, I was so sleep deprived and was desperate for some sleep. My sister gave me this book and after following everything in this book, it took my twins only 1 week to get used to their schedule and started sleeping through the night when they were only 8 weeks old. By the time they were one, they were sleeping 12 hours at night, straight! I let them cry for about 5 minutes and eventually, they learned to soothe themselves back to sleep. And now, they don't wake up crying...they slimply ""talk"" to each other. It's great...I recommend this book to all parents!"
2,I wouldn't recommend it,"People kept telling me this was the book to read but I found it dry, difficult to get through, and difficult to impliment. While this author advocates extinction, I'm not comfortable with letting my baby cry it out without any reassurance. And the other options just didn't feel workable. Ultimately, I read Ferber's new book and found it much more gentle and practical than this one. My baby learned very quickly to fall asleep on her own and is sleeping very well now. I highly recommend Ferber's book."
1,Weissbluth's approach is calloused and barbaric,"I read this, every word. I couldn't believe some of the things Weissbluth was suggesting. At one point, he advocated leaving a baby alone after he had vomited: Don't clean him up, just leave him be. Basically he said leave your child alone to scream as long as it takes. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I would have given this less than a one star rating, but it isn't possible."
4,So far so good,I bought this book while I was pregnant as it seemed to be the book to read for expectant mothers in Chicago. Our son is now 4 months old and while we have not followed everything Dr. Weissbluth has recommended we have tried to incorporate most of his methods. Our son now only wakes occasionally during the night and returns to sleep very quickly and without much crying.
4,This is the only sleep book you need,"This is a wonderful book, an easy book to read, understand and implement. It suggests the clock in which a child will/should thrive. Just know that just as you establish bedtime routines, establish a similar routine to let the kids know they are winding down to nap. Treat naps as you would nighttime sleeping - as in, IT matters! I established reading for 15 -20 minutes in quiet voices and soft singing for naps, and then for bedtime, the 6 b's. Beach (activity), bath, books, bottle, brush(tooth), and bed. No music and low lighting while reading with quiet voices. But the book gave me the confidence to give her the GIFT of sleep. It was a hard week to NOT go to her every 5-10 minutes when we were sleep training her but she now can put herself to sleep ANYWHERE - planes, hotels, etc. Weissbluth is a pro."
4,Great ideas - somewhat conflicting,"I thought the overall idea of this book exemplified Dr. Weissbluth's intelligence and experience in this field. However, I agree with previous reviewers that the book needs some editing. I will add also that there is some conflicting advice in this book - especially when trying to figure out when to start sleep training, when to let babies cry, when to not let them cry, soothing them to sleep when they are tired (but somehow around 9AM and 12-2PM for naps??)...overall, however, I would recommend this book. THe best thing we did was never let our baby stay awake for more than 2 hours at a time - our baby went from what our MD called collicky to a very happy baby (who, however, still does not sleep through the night at 4 months...but the change in her happiness from that one simple intervention is reason enough for me to offer a recommendation!!)."
3,Confusing about different methods,"The author tries to be open-minded about different methods: no-cry, graduated extinction, and cold-turkey cry-it-out methods. By not discussing in details the different approaches, he ends up giving the impression that just letting your child cry-it-out alone for hours in a row is the best approach (it works, by the way, but is not the best approach). For a parent willing to try the ""cry-it-out"" method, the graduated extinction may be the best solution. This is particularly true for those who tried (and failed) a no-cry solution. For this reason, I strongly recommend, instead, Ferber's book.The book is also unpleasant to read. It is badly organized, making it difficult to either read sequentially or to find the information you want. The author seems tremendously self-absorbed, spending lots of time talking about how important he is and how famous his patients are (not the most relevant information a sleepy parent wants to read)."
3,Useful Yet Painful,"This book definately helped me solve my son's sleep issues. It gave me the confidence to finally let him ""cry it out"" at seven months. It only took two nights of fits. I had tried CIO at around four months on the advice of my doctor, but it was horrible. I am glad I waited a little while and tried again. Anyway, this book is the most painful read ever. There is no rhyme or reason to the layout. I just skipped around and extracted what I found useful for my situation. There is good information, just do not plan on reading it cover to cover unless you love pain."
5,Great book,"Loved this information in this book. It was very helpful, as I am a first time mother. Discusses how to get your baby into a nap cycle and sleep cycle."
2,Good info but difficult to read...,"I thought the info in the book was helpful however it was disorganized. Overall, I thought the book was difficult to read. I found myself jumping from section to section trying to find relevant info for our situation.The guidelines are also a bit harsh. We used what we wanted and ignored the rest. I recommend, ""Sleeping Through the Night"" by Jodi Mindell. Her suggestions are much easier on baby as well as mom and dad. Our 11 month old sleeps 11 hours at night and takes two great naps (1.5-3 hours). She babbles herself to sleep and wakes up smiling."
1,poorly written and wordy,"My baby is due in a few weeks and I've been reading a variety of books on sleeping methods. This book was highly recommended by a friend. Unfortunately, it's so poorly written and organized that I am unwilling to continue with the book! If you are someone who likes a book to get to the point and give you practical information, skip this one. The book doesn't even explain who is ""talking"" from paragraph to paragraph and erratically skips from Dr. Weissbluth's voice to stories of babies with poor sleeping habits by parents who are unintroduced and unidentified in the book."
4,"A very useful, sensible book","Nothing seems to divide new parents more than the issue of sleep. If your natural instinct is to let your child sleep in your bed (which seems to be the case with most of the negative reviews on this site), then Weissbluth's book is not for you. But if you want informed, practical advice on how to train your child to sleep in another room -- and how to deal with any sleep issues that arise in the following years -- then you can't do better than this book. Our daughter is a living (and sleeping) testament to the effectiveness of Weissbluth's methods, and we're grateful. My only complaint about the book is that it's not encyclopedic, and we have encountered several scenarios that Weissbluth doesn't address. But with his solid foundation to build on, common sense tends to take care of the rest."
5,It worked for us,"For five monthes our first child cried from 6pm until midnight every night. A friend of ours who had gone through the same thing recommended this book. For us, it worked. My children, now 8 and 6, are good sleepers and very happy, energetic children. I have given this book to other parents and it has worked for over half of them. Not everyone can listen to their child cry but if you can bear it for a few days, life will be easier in the long run. Good Luck!"
2,Complicated and challenging to read,"When you're spending all day taking care of a baby and you're awake all night you are probably like me: too dang tired to read a complicated, scientific book. (Read the Look inside the book pages for a sample) I agreed with about half of what I read, but there is alot in here that I totally disagreed with. The general sleep information is good, but the technique is old-fashioned. My grandmother told me to put my baby in the crib and let her cry herself to sleep, I didn't need this book for that advice, and I don't feel good about that approach. A better choice for modern, gentle sleep ideas is The No-Cry Sleep Solution."
1,Outdated and insensitive,"This book was first written in 1987 and the approach was how things were taught back then. Even the authors comment in the introduction that he ""helped my wife raise four sons"" (page xiv) demonstrates the old way of thinking - that he was the helper instead of parent-partner. There is a lot of interesting material about sleep and how important it is, but the book falls flat when it comes to solutions. The author explains that night wakings for feeding is normal, and that babies do wake in the night ""wet, soiled or hungry"" yet goes on to promote unlimited crying (Page 159 ""When crying is open-ended the child learns to stop protesting"")This is to teach a child not to rely upon the parents during the night, saying ""We are leaving him alone to forget the expectation to be picked up."" (page 159) I find the theory outdated and the methods harsh and insensitive. I'd recommend The Happiest Baby on the Block or The No-Cry Sleep Solution instead."
4,"Good Advice, yet know your baby's needs","I found hte advice in this book useful, and I also feel that parents need to understand the individual needs of their child. Children, like all adults, do have a natural clock. Some are early risers, and some are not. It's great to put your child on a schedule, yet don't overdo your child's schedule.Regarding the famiily bed, sometimes a child might be scared during a thunderstorm, and need the comfort of loving parents. There is nothing wrong with this. Ignoring your child during such times would only make matters worse.Love you child, yet know they are unique, just as you are."
2,"Some good content, hidden behind impossibly bad writing","A few helpful nuggets, strewn randomly across almost 500 pages of rambling natterings. Comically poorly written book. Seems like the author did some excellent research on a worthy topic, but then felt the key findings were too light to monetize, and decided to stretch a very finite set of insights and suggestions that could easily fit on a couple of pages across (multiple!) tedious filibuster books. It pleased me to see the cheap newspaper stock of this incoherent tome disintegrate in my fireplace."
5,What a Godsend!,"After reading Ferber and Pantley, we decided Ferber didn't make sense for us and Pantley (No-Cry Sleep Solution) did not work when put into practice. The Pantley Pull Out method, in particular, frustrated both the baby and us to no end. In fact, the strategy resulted in the baby (and us) getting less sleep. Weissbluth's book, however, proved to be just the thing. His advice is based on actual research and his detailed recommendations are compassionate and possible to implement on a consistent basis. I feel that Dr. Weissbluth cares very much about babies' and their parents' well-being. And he knows what he's talking about. Our baby is now sleeping well at night at 5 months and his napping has never been better (from 45 minute naps, tops, to 1.5 to 2 hours per nap). We have highly recommended the book to friends and family who have children."
5,Every parent should have this book!,"Never thought I would have a restful night, but the information in this book helped me solve the mystery of infant sleep (or the lack of). Dr. Weissbluth's scientific approach to a happy child is so true. Sleep, sleep, sleep. My six year old is the best sleeper I could ask for and it's all because of the information I read in this book. Wouldn't live with out it, especially with a second child in the picture."
1,Does your baby deserve this abuse?,"I simply don't understand the popularity of this book. It was given to me as a baby shower present, and i read it from cover to cover. I believe this is an abusive, heartless and disrespectful way to treat a child. What exactly are you teaching your baby by breaking his or her will? As for Weissbluth's absurd contention that you shouldn't let your baby sleep in the car or stroller...how does one achieve such a thing, and for what?In most of the world's cultures, this method would be considered an appalling Western curiosity.At seven months, my son sleeps 11 hours at night and naps well during the day. It took 2 months of gentle and patient training, and there were no tears. When I began, he was waking up 3 times every night. I used my own method, but a similar one can be found in the (albeit irritating and poorly-written) book ""The No Cry Sleep Solution"".There are loving ways of achieving a good's night sleep. This isn't one of them."
1,SLEEPLESS NIGHTS,"THE SLEEPLESS NIGHTS ENDED UP BEING FOR ME NOT MY BABY AFTER I READ THIS BOOK! I FOUND THE ADVICE IN THIS BOOK TO BE SCARY AND DETRIMENTAL TO MY HEALTH AS A NEW MOTHER. BABIES ARE NOT MACHIENES AND SHOULD BE CARED FOR AND LOVED AND NOT LEFT IN A CRIB TO ""CRY IT OUT."" AFTER READING THE FIRST FOUR CHAPTERS OF THE BOOK I RETURNED IT. DR. SEARS OFFERS MUCH BETTER ADVICE IN ""THE BABY BOOK."" DR. WEISBLUTH INFERS THAT IF THE BABY DOES NOT GET ON A REGULAR SLEEP SCHEDULE BY 6 WEEKS OF AGE THAT THEY STAND THE CHANCE OF DEVELOPING ADHD OR LEARNING PROBLEMS LATER IN LIFE. THIS IS THE WORST ADVICE YOU COULD GIVE TO NEW HORMONAL MOTHERS. HAVING WORKED IN AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR MANY YEARS I KNOW THIS TO BE COMPLETE BUNK! I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE, EVEN MY WORST ENEMY. TAKE MY ADVICE AND DON'T BUY IT. BUY DR. SEARS INSTEAD AND LOOK FORWARD TO A HEALTHY BABY."
5,"4 days and she NAPS! finnally, no crying just happier.","Wow, who would have thought my baby could nap. Endless walking by grandparents who 'know' how to get a baby to sleep, endless miles of driving, hours of rocking and it was all being done at the wrong times!This morning, greated by a happy giggling 4 month old when she got up after a full nights cry free sleep, ate a good breakfast, played a bit. then started to soothe her, 2 hours after waking up with only a 'eh eh eh' really tired cry she is sound asleep for her morning nap.This is an active fussy baby with reflux and its working for her with no real crying. Yes the book is a thick read, BUT there are survival tips in the back of each chapter. Plus it is nicely broken into age appropriate sections. Understanding WHY she was getting cranky has led to being able to stop it before it starts.Now I'm desperately trying to get my best friend to read this book to help with her 3yo who is the poster child of sleep deprived."
1,No Concrete Solutions,"In this book, Weissbluth goes on and on about what you *should* do, without offering concrete solutions. We all know that our babies should nap, but what do you do when they just won't? I found this book to be badly written and extremely unhelpful."
3,Good information,"Although I despise the way this book is written, it does offer some sound advise to creating healthy sleep habits for your infant. I found the book difficult to follow, repetitive, and often times confusing, but once I implemented the strategies outlined, we quickly had a bedtime routine that worked for our family and surprisingly did not include a lot of crying from our 3 month old. By 4 months of age he is able to put himself to sleep and stay asleep all night, which is a blessing for us."
4,"Working on Happy, Healthy habits","The book, Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child had been very helpful in working on getting my baby to sleep better. I think the book gives you a new perspective on how important sleep is and how mush sleep is needed. I only wish I would have bought this book prior to my baby being born. She is now 9 months and some of the material would have worked better when she was younger. Like any book, you have to take what works for you and use it and disregard what doesn't work for you and your family. I have been putting her to sleep at 7am, and she is so much happier when she wakes up. I have had to adapt to that as well, because our schedule has changed, but it has been very positive."
2,Dense reading,"This is known for being such a resource for research on sleep, but I had a hard time staying with it. It reads more like a text book which is not something I could swallow as a new mom. I respect it for what it has contributed, but if you are a new parent, it may be difficult to continue to pick up (especially with your own sleep deprivation)."
5,Happy Child,"I received this book as a baby shower gift from a friend who had a 4 year who DID NOT sleep through the night and a 7 month old who DID sleep through the night. She got the book while pregnant with the second and was amazed by the differences in her two kids-with naps, bedtime, and child's temperment. My child is 15 months old, has slept through the night since she was 2 months, takes 2 2-hour naps a day, goes to bed at 7:00 pm and we don't hear a peep out of her until 6:30 the next morning. This book is amazing. DO what it tells you to do and your child will be sleeping through the night in no time. I am pregnant with number 2 and plan on doing the same things as we did with number 1- and I am sure we will see the same results. BUY IT."
3,"Okay, but better ones to follow","I like the First Three years of life better for sleep guidelines. I think this had good information about how important sleep is to your child and I did benefit from reading this book...but...I don't agree with the ""crying it out"" stage for an infant (4mo's & younger). I have a three year old also and putting her to bed at 7 is not realistic. The strict sleep practices are hard with traveling, activities, and family time."
5,Great Book!!,Worked beautifully with my twins ... before they were fussy sleep deprived babies and after they were so happy! Sticking to the routine was the key. I have recommended this book many times over especially to mothers of twins!
3,Sent it back.,With a new infant I was really looking for a sleep book more directed toward getting my baby to soothe herself to sleep and to get naps into her day. This book was just too broad for me. It cover sleep problems from infancy through insomnia in teenagers. Just more info than I was looking for.
1,Not as easy as it sounds,"I read this book and wasn't comfortable with the techniques, so I visted a sleep training support message board of mothers using his ideas. I was amazed to see that so many of them were making their babies cry endlessly for weeks, sometimes months, and one mother complained that she had been doing it for almost a year. This book makes it sound like every baby will sleep after a night of two of crying but that obviously isn't true. I also bought The No-Cry Sleep Solution which covers much of the same sleep data but then provides gentle non-crying solutions, which I am more comfortable with."
4,Helpful.... but....,Not so helpful for buying to solve sleep problems with a child over 24 months of age. A VERY helpful book for a baby and the first year. I wish I had this book for my first child.
5,Every baby should be born holding this book in their hands!,Should be a must read for all parents. I have a happy camper who sleeps 12 hours uninterupted every night and takes 3 naps in the day. He is bright and easy going when he is awake. Dr. W knows his babies! Thanks you so much for writting this book!
5,It works!,"I was very skeptical of the information presented in the book but had a miserable, non-napping 5 month-old boy. He slept very well at night but would not nap consistently during the day and then would be crabby and unhappy in the early evening before bed. We thought this was his personality. After 3 weeks of using the methods in the book he is napping during the day and sleeping better at night. Naps aside he is now happy,bubbly fun and alert and the ""crabby baby"" is gone. This is one kid who thrives on schedules and understanding that hurdle was a breakthrough. He now cries very rarely when put down for naps and seems to look forward to them. Of course keeping them on a schedule is challenging but in our case well worth the effort."
4,"You can't live without this book, but you have to study it.","This book is the most important book I have ever read. The methods for helping your child sleep are fantastic. The only problem is that the book is so poorly written that you need to read it several times in order to get ALL the important info out. If you don't spend the extra time with it you may miss vital information, such as this method should create very little or no crying if you pay attention to your child and the clock. This method truly help make HAPPY BABIES.Careful Reading"
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on,"Wow. In looking for a solution to our sleep problems, I found this book. There are a lot of sleep ""training"" books out there, and a lot of different styles, but this guy basically comes right out and says you're an idiot if you don't do what he says! How modest!I've never really had the urge to punch someone like I do with him.Didn't finish, needless to say!"
1,Awful,This book is awful. Use it if you want to force your child to sleep like one of my friends. I have never seen a child be put to sleep on command. Its a guide and not be followed by exact print.
2,"Organized poorly, questions are not realistic either","I read this and ""Your Fussy Baby"" and I still have a screaming overtired child. First off, Dr. W. says that the first nap should occur at 9:00 --- try keeping your 5-month old awake from 5:00 or 6:00 for 3 hours (Dr. W. suggests keeping the baby up for only 1 hour after waking!). Don't waste your money on this. I have found that, like many other issues that test our patience, you just need to do what will work for you. After all, 30 years ago no parent read a book on how to feed, bathe, or get their babies to sleep!"
