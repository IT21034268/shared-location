1,Don't waste your time.,"Don't waste your time or your money on this. The story is shallow and boring. In a word, this is a bad movie. No wonder it went directly to DVD."
1,it stinks!,"As most of us know this movie is based on the book by John Grisham which is about lawsuits against tobacco companies. A ridiculous premise at best but John Grisham makes it exciting and the book is hard to put down. Now, my reaction to the movie can be summed up in two words-boring and ridiculous. I guess the producers decided to do the politically correct thing and trade tobacco companies for gun manufacturers. I think that when a gun manufacturer gets sued because some serial killer used a gun they made is beyond stupid and since I'm a gun enthusiast I take it as a personal offense. That aside, movie is boring, John Cusack is boring and a lousy actor. The end."
3,Walk don't run,"Another legal thriller from John Grishham as formulaic as the second and other movies. The book took on tobacco, which is a better story in my mind than guns. But that's Hollywood and speaking of Hollywood...No heat between Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman, not like the DeNiro - Pacino face-off.Hackman and Hoffman are both fine actors that create intrigue and excitement with the characters they bring to life, but this movie forces it and it never worked for me. John Cusack does a fine and believable job and should be considered the next generation's Hackman or Hoffman.My problem is with the story, how it was told and the portions not told. Juries always surprise, but we should be able to understand motive. Very forgettable, save the performances. Wish they had saved the cast for a better script."
3,Things that make you go huumm!,"Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack and Rachel Weisz what could be better? Hackman; the consummate professional, is wonderfully sinister as a jury fixing corporate insider. And Cusack and Weisz simmer as a scorned couple bent on corporate and judicial revenge in this taut thriller. In truth, knowing that such technology exists makes one wonder sometimes whether corporate America is capable of such sinister behavior. In the end, Runaway Jury delivers!"
2,Thumbs up for Weisz and Hackman but Thumbs down for the rest,"I did like what I saw in the film but that was because of the effort made by Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman,who both manage to make this film somewhat much better than it really is and that's pretty good considering the fact that the movie is not that good at all. Both actors are able to make lemonade out of a real lemon of a script that makes no effort to try to explain itself during key scenes and manages to contradict itself in certain parts of the movie.See it for the great acting by Weisz and Hackman but only see it once. The rest of the movie does not live up to their performances."
3,The acting is great but the movie is not that good.,"Tepid reworking of the John Grisham book misses the inner workings of the subject matter at hand and delivers a week adaptation that lacks the conviction and the substance of the novel. The script is a mess from start to finish, and some sub plots involving certain characters don't really go anywhere in terms of furthering the plot along. The acting is very good with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who really makes this film a better one than it really is with her great performance and Gene Hackman, who kept the pace up with his great performance with a villainous, and yet sympathetic role. Dustin Hoffman is great as well but is not really in the film as much as advertise, and John Cusack does fine with his role. I just wish that the movie could have been as professional and as graceful as the actors involved, instead of the clunker that is presented to us now."
2,so bad,"Why does Hollywood still make bad movies? Don't they owe us, the paying public some quality films? This movie is such a bad film. Call me at 156-38-3461."
2,Don't Trust the Reviews on Amazon...,"I saw this movie and it wasn't the worst movie of the year but it wasn't very good either. A waste of time and money. Very flat and unimaginative. Better to see it on cable. But the first review of this movie posted her on Amazon made me suspicious. I have heard from others that since Amazon doesn't screen the reviews of anything posted, it's more than likely that people who need/want a product to be sucessful (including movies) will deliberately post overly positive reviews knowing that people are all to easily fooled. I suspect it with this post. Please...don't waste your time and $$$ with this movie. It's simply not worth it when there are other, much better movies out there like ""School of Rock"", or ""Lost in Translation""."
4,Better than expected....,"I was doubtful about renting this movie, I mean I saw Hackman and Duffman on the actors and I thought ""This movie must be good"". However Cusack is not a great actor in my opinion and Rachel Weizs's only good movie for my taste has been The Constant Gardener.However I rented and at the end I got surprised.... so much that I actually bought the movie a couple of days later.I haven't read anything from Grisham, however based on this movie I will in the future.It's a good movie with the hell of a twist at the end..... Watch it, buy it or rent it.... You wont be dissapointed!!!!!!"
1,1 star for special effects ONLY,"I liked the movie until it finally dawned on me how many lies are in it and how biased the story is against NRA members and gun owners and manufacturer's. It had excellent effects, but I don't appreciate the film makers, actors, and writers implying that I, as a NRA member and gun owner for 30 yrs, and Proud of it, am some sort of thug who condones selling guns to criminals. Hoffman and all the others who twisted this film (The book this movie is based on has nothing at all to do with guns) should keep their political agendas and bias out of the films, since some of the story plot is half-lies and some of the truth is (conveniently) left out. The effects a are good though and it has plenty of action. Still, I'll never rent it or watch it again."
4,Not the greatest thing since sliced bread but a good flick!,I just got done watching this movie on dvd a mere 20 minutes ago.I got it as a gift and im glad I did after watching it.I see that most of the reviews here were luke warm at best but I happened to have liked the film.it starts off a tad slow but picks up alot of speed and it was good entertianment.The scenes between Dustin Hoffman and Gene Hackman are worth owning the dvd alone.
4,Great cast elevates a formula movie,"Casting choices can undermine otherwise satisfying movies - Matthew McConaughey and Ben Stiller come to mind as does Nicholas Cage in any role where he's not playing a creep. Runaway Jury bennefits from a uniformly excellent cast. John Cusack, Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman make their characters distinctive, solid and real. Secondary roles are also well cast. Unfortunately, New Orleans - so vibrant in movies like the Big Easy, was underused as a setting. None the less, what would otherwise be a generic John Grisham movie (ohmigosh...there's a surprise twist at the end!) stands up well in repeating viewings."
4,"Good film made great by Weisz, Hackman, Hoffman, and Cusack","Good Entry in the John Grisham series of books made into movies that is almost as good as The Firm. All The actors involved make this movie a real treat to see. Gene Hackman is fantastic as always, Dustin Hoffman's come back continues with full force with he great performance. Rachel Weisz gives Gene Hackman a run for his money with her strong and wonderful performance, and John Cusack makes himself a real contender for the mantle Tom Hanks has for the most natural actor around.Don't expect every body to agree with what the movie is trying to say but it's a poignant message to consider."
2,A legal bind of creative proportion.,"Flat legal Thriller that has a great cast but does not have a great script to go with them. Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman all do well with what is on the script but you can tell that they are giving it more heart and substance than what was on the written page. The direction is fine but lacks coherency and the setting of New Orleans is not fully represented to it's full potential. I have not read the original book that inspired this movie but judging by the word of mouth, the book is considered much better. I give thanks to Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman for making this movie a much better film than it really is but I also feel bad for then for not having a script that helps them move this picture along to a much better end."
3,Implausible thriller that is lifted by the acting.,"Implausible court thriller that rips off its much better novel and puts fourth a movie that lacks all the suspends and wit of its book origin. Only (like every one has been saying) the acting is worth anything with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman doing extraordinary jobs with their two-dimensional characters, and Dustin Hoffman, and John Cusack doing ok with what they have. For their efforts (Mostly the acting of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman) the movie gets three stars but judging the move as a whole, it's only worth two. Blame the script for that.I would love to see Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz work together again, but hopefully in a better movie with a better script."
3,Bad interpretation of the book,"Hackman and Hoffman were typecasted. Cusack, forgettable. Keep your eye out for Weisz (Marlee), she's got potential. 3 stars because she carried the movie.Read the book, it's a lot more exciting and coherent. The film attempts to make a political point about gun control but falls completely flat because the arguments are never developed and so the reason for jury tampering is not believable. Anyone with half an understanding of ""agency"" would realize that there was no case against the gun manufacturer in the way it was setup. Therefore, the verdict at the end looked more like jury revolt, ala O.J. Simpson (a tired theme), than jury tampering (the point of the story).The film maker should have stuck with the tobacco manufacturers, as in the book. But I suppose this would have dated the movie. I am surprised that Grisham, a lawyer, allowed the movie to be rewritten this way. I guess he was paid a lot of money to look the other way."
2,Not very good at all.,"Minds numbing adaptation to the John Grisham novel lacks his artistic punch and flare for justice and replaces it with a typical Hollywood movie that caters to speculation other than fact. The script has too many holes to be considered a passable story, and while the direction is decent, it lacks a real sense of depth. The acting on the other hand is good with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman making this film much better than it deserved to be with their very good performances, and Dustin Hoffman is fine as well but he's not in the movie as much. John Cusack is decent and the rest of the cast makes due but the movie does not do them or the viewer any justice in terms of storytelling.Thanks to Weisz, Hackman, and Hoffman, the movie makes a fine rental, but its only good for a few good moments."
1,Ruined by Proseletizing,"Good airplane book taken and twisted, and in the end, nothing but Nanny statism. ...What could have been a fantastic movie was a dissappointment. The acting was good because what Hackman movie doesn't have at least that? Cusack is as intense as ever...actually one of his better efforts (Loved Grosse Point Blank). So if we ban guns then er um there will be no crime right? Just like we illegalized drugs and there are no drugs....???"
4,"Great cast, good film","Just watched Runaway Jury on DVD. I give it **** out of five stars.What I liked about it:Great cast - One of Cusack's better roles. Weisz reminded me of Maryann Mastrantonio in Color of Money. Quite a change from her roles in The Mummy series. Jeremy Piven always shines when given the chance.Good storylineWhat I didn't like about it:SPOILER WARNING****4/5th of the way through I felt like I was watching a plot that was very innovative. The ending seemed cliche. Expected the unexpected, not former victims wanting justice type of ending (almost a Disney, the good guys win in the end, type ending). Not a bad ending, just not up to the level of writing displayed up to that point."
2,Not A Very Good Thriller,"Runaway Jury seemed from the trailers to be a nail-biting thriller with huge caliber acting talent. Although John Cusack, Gene Hackman, and Dustin Hoffman turn in great performances, the movie falls on its face. Any soundtrack seems non-existent. There is not much suspense. Cusack's girlfriend, the main female character, is completely cold and unsympathetic. She does not have an ounce of warmth in her body. And she is supposed to be someone you root for through the whole film. I wanted her to get her comeuppance, but unfortunately she did not. The movie ended up being a preachy film about gun control.The opening sequence is one of the best I have ever seen. If only the rest of the movie was as good as the first five minutes."
3,Passable Entertainment,"Big glossy Hollywood entertainment. Fun to watch? Yeah, I guess. Thought this thing had a few plot holes though, such as why the Hackman character wouldn't go after the Cusack character and his girlfriend after being double-crossed. Also, totally implausible plot, Grisham or not, I thought. Rather silly when all is said and done. But That's Entertainment!"
4,Cat and mouse film!,"This movie is interesting , but it will never be a classic film.The charismatic presence of John Cussack , the dazzling performance of Gene Hackman and the worthy effort of Rachel Weiz save the film in 60% .The script is kinetic. The process of selection of a jury , is shown before the viewer with all his ugliness and tricks. The information services are under several forces of different ethical levels.The fable of the hunter hunted is told with dynamics ; the script is well written . You may reply the picture lacks deepness ; but who cares? You really won't find out shadows of Twelve angry men , for instance , but the cast is alright.The film promises you more than you expect , especially to the end ; but it reveals an interesting insight about the dark regions of the justice underworld .Good direction!"
4,Important issues raised,"I give this movie 4 stars because of 2 standout performances by Dustin Hoffman as a public defender and by Gene Hackman as an evil jury stacker for corporate America, because of some slick photography of New Orleans, and because the issues it raises are important: can the little guy ever win out against corporate giants in America? Is it even worth the effort to try? The answer this film gives is a resounding yes, in this gun control case in which the gun manufacturers are found guilty of complicity in the murder of a father of 2 and his widow, as she receives a very large award. The movie begs comparison with the tobacco cases, and I might say, in defense of the tobacco companies, that I myself quit smoking after 20 years, so it's not easy, but it can be done. This is quite irrelevant to the present film,but I thought I'd mention it. The film carries itself along at a brisk pace, but not quite brisk enough for 5 stars."
4,Runaway Hit!!,"This was a great thriller, with just enough suspense, romance, violence, and plot-twisting. Interesting and easy to follow, but not boring. Great acting! (and, I love John Cusack's eyes!)"
3,"Average movie, overhyped","I guess I don't mind too much that the movie differed from the book a bit (or a whole lot as the case may be), however, it went a bit too far in presenting the tricks and underhanded dealing that lawyers use. I'm not saying I think that the modern member of the bar is a saint, however, I think Hollywood got a little too carried away here.The movie itself was entertaining, if not a bit predictable and somewhat of a cliché in ways. I suppose I don't understand why a good book isn't just made into a good film, but then again, who am I?I'd recommend watching this, but can't hardly give it a strong recommendation to own, once you've seen it and the outcome, there isn't that much to get excited about seeing it again."
3,Court drama that losses touch with reality.,"The movie is good with what it has, which is in the fact the acting but loses creditability during the second half where reality should have been given more weight to help the story along. Can a Juror with an outside accomplice really take control of a jury? I don't think so but the actors do a damn fine job in making it seem real. Gene Hackman and Rachel Weisz are great as rivals who want to control the jury, and Dustin Hoffman and John Cusack support them well in their roles. The setting is fine but we don't really grasp New Orleans as a whole, and the story, which was taken from the book from John Grisham, does not do it justice.I recommend it for the great acting of Gene Hackman, and Rachel Weisz, and the great support of Dustin Hoffman and John Cusack. But I can't say that the movie is based on reality because it really is not."
5,This movie is great.,"Suspense, action, and romance, you have to watch this movie twice to understand every bit of it. Very deeply overlayed. A play of ideas at it's most dramatic."
5,SUPERB!!!,"I don't really understand why other folks don't appreciate this film. I was reluctant to see it, but did so based on the recommendation of a Grisham fan (not the movies, but the books), and he said it was a fine adaptation. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time--I ended up watching it a second time the very next day, which I don't typically do. It's unfortunate that with all the trash Hollywood is releasing nowadays, this film didn't receive the notice it should have. Apparently, not everyone will enjoy it, but as for me, I loved every minute of it--great plot, filming, and performances all around."
2,Not A Runaway Hit,"Runaway Jury is yet another film based on a John Grishman best seller. The film is set in New Orleans and centers around jury tampering in a potentially landmark case about gun makers responsibility to victims of gun violence. The film has a nice premise and nice plot twist at the end, but overall the film seems pasted together. The performances by the stars Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, John Cusack & Rachel Weisz aren't bad, in fact all are quite competant. It's just that they lack any real feeling, sort of like going through the motions."
3,Used,I chose three stars as you can tell that it has been used often. I have not read it as my tern has not started yet so can not give further feed back.I am happy with the book as is.
4,Grea old footage of Jazz legends,"While I find the title slightly misleading...in that Dexter and Ben play separately. The video is grainy, which is to be expected with age of the recording. The audio is good not great. All this being said I am satisfied and would recommend it to the fans of these legends."
2,Horrific sound quality,"Incredible artistry, but the sound of Dexter Gordon's tenor saxophone is captured so awfully that it sounds like a buzzing cell phone. He deserves better, and so do you."
5,5TH VISION IS NUMERO UNO! BUY THIS CD NOW!,"5th Vision's self-titled CD should be #1 one your list...It has hot beats, firey latin rythyms and soulful voices to make a CD that is definitely CALIENTE! The debut CD is NOT your normal CD that only has one or two good songs. This CD has the potential to contain some #1 hits. It makes you wanna get up and dance, and then it mellows you out with their soothing slow jams. They have there own unique style and rythyms. (It's like Backstreet Boys, N'SYNC, and 98 Degrees mixed with Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Enrique Iglesias....but better! 5th Vision is worth every penny you pay. I recommend you have it rushed ordered."
5,They are the best!!!,I think 5th Vision is awesome! I knew Alex in jr. high and he is the sweetest and funniest guy. i never knew he could sing but one day i saw his face on the cover of this cd. and i am so proud of him. this cd has great songs and its really cute!!
3,"Not really my cup of tea, but...","Scotland has offered many Pretenders to the throne, but few as absurd as this mega-schmaltzy Elgin-born pianist, who was advertised (in Portugal) as ""the king of samba"". Inglez worked his way up through Edmundo Ros' latin dance orchestra and, as the war came to an end, started his own band. This disc of UK light programme fodder features 24 tracks of instrumental treacle which would do Melanchrino or Montovani proud. Only for the uber-Easy Listening fanatic."
4,I hated this book in the beginning and now i love it,I am a student from Long Island.My teacher assinged the girls to read Plain Girl and the boys Jip.When i first started I hated this book and could not wait until it was over.Then all of a sudden the book got better.Maybe it was because Esther started school and was turning out to be just like her brother.I don't know.But I do know that this is a great book. I can't wait until they make a sequil or a movie out of this book.
5,This record has left me nearly speachless...,"Wow, truly. I am a big fan of Bart Davenport, but besides that fact, this is something ever so different and special. This is the darkest, grooviest, and most beautiful album I have heard in years. From beginning to end it is masterful... Just put in on repeat and let it go... lose yourself in it..."
1,honey,"I didn't know much about these guys when i bought this, the main draw card was that it was on quannum records.Well was i wrong in thinking it would be cool!! The first track is really good then thats it. The rest of the album is just Bleh! Bleh! Bleh!i suggest you try listening to it before you buy it.Quannum what were you thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"A little hard, but fun!","Bought this for my nine year old daughter. She was a little discouraged at first because it seemed too hard, but once I joined in with her, she got the hang of it. Neither one of us can do it up to speed, but it's lots of fun at half speed!!!"
3,a little too complicated,Ordered for my 11 yr old. She got discouraged at how fast the dance was being taught. This would be a better video for girls with dance experience.
1,False advertised nintendo controller,"Do NOT buy this Nintendo 64 controller if you are looking for the original, well shaped, gray controller. Although the picture shows a normal controller, the one they sent to me was made by a third party (not by Nintendo) and does not feel the same or handle the same - in fact, it feels less comfortable and ergonomic, and handles with less precision. Also, I emailed the company about it and received no response. So, do not pay money for this controller if you are looking for something that you will actually want to use for a N64 system."
1,False advertisement!! You should know that cause of the price!!,"But for proof, just look under the picture of the ""Nintendo 64 controller"" and you'll see a third party controller. Shame on them for not being honest with the buyers!It must really suck if it's that cheap. Just buy one here for about 17 bucks; they're worth it!"
5,I always enjoy the nintendo 64,The original controllers made by nintendo are far most the best pick out of the other off brand controllers. They have lasted way longer than my madcat controllers. If you are wanting to buy a controller for the 64 I recommend this controller even if it is a few dollars more. I think quality is the most important and this product has it.
1,very bad service,I bought 2 controllers and never recieved either of them. don't trust these guys i told them i didn't receved them and they did do anything about it.
3,so-so,"It's a cool controller, I admit that, but it's kinda wierd. It doesn't have a very sturdy feel, the buttons seem weak, and the control stick made my hand ache for days. It's good, but a little crumby."
3,Other brands perform better,"I drive a work van and have had these Satisfied Brakes #FL269, Fleet Severe duty pads installed for over 6 months. I installed pads, rotors and calipers at that time. I use Severe duty pads because I want to stop quickly with my rather heavy loads. These pads feel like bargain pads, require much more pedal effort to stop and are wearing quickly to boot. I have used a few other major manufactures severe duty pads in the past and they all dug into the rotors and performed their function. I do not care about rotor wear as they are easy and cheap to replace but long stops are a problem.I contacted Satisfied with my experience and asked if they had a more aggressive pad but got no response. The packaging was nice and the pads looked good but from my experience were not what a severe duty pad should be. I would not purchase again."
5,Saved us lots of time and aggravation,My company was recently hired to do a site revision for a HUGE site. This book helped us keep our ducks in a row and do lots of up front work before we started changing over content. The client resources provided at the web site were very helpful! HIghly recommend for any web site designers/developers library.
5,Web Redesign is very solid,"This book provided an easy methodology for developing a project from day one. Sure there are things that will suprise you along the way if you venture out to consult a company on redesign; this book is not a tell all. However, the information provided in this book helped me to draw up a timeline, develop prototypes, and prepare me for the lumps I received on my first consulting project. Any methodology requires practice, and practicing the methodology in this book is a good start to successful design.The book is humorous, flavorful, colorful and specific enough. The only thing I didn't like is how if fits in my bookshelf (squaty and wide)."
5,¡Excelente Libro! - Excellent Book!,"Web ReDesign - Workflow that Works, es un libro muy completo y fácil de asimilar. Explica el contorno completo que uno como desarrollador debe contemplar para el ReDiseño de un sitio Web.Te lleva de la mano desde la fase inicial de un proyecto hasta su implementación. Explica con mucha claridad cada una de las 5 diferentes fases, que proponen Kelly y Emily, para el desarrollo de un proyecto. Con ejemplos y casos de estudio reales.Ofrece recomendaciones para los diferentes roles que integran un equipo de trabajo, como lo son: diseñadores gráficos, diseñadores de información, arquitectos de información, aseguradores de calidad, programadores, desarrolladores, administradores de proyectos, etc.Para quienes desarrollamos sitios Web, es un magnífico complemento; para quienes van a iniciarse, es un medio muy completo de aprendizaje.Como usuario mexicano/hispano, lo recomiendo sin duda alguna.¡Felicidades!"
1,Basic book with (ironically) a horrible user interface,"This is a very difficult book to process.Both my wife and I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where our eyes are supposed to go.While there are many interesting issues that are culled from other books, there's not enough depth to make any chapters stand out in my mind. Want a great book on the web? Get ""Don't Make Me Think!""....."
2,No so much design as it is workflow,"When I came looking for this book I was hopeing to get a new perspective on the design of a website, this book, has very little if any, it more on how to plan a project for a big buiness than the home buisness or single site admin, if thats what your looking for, then I recomend this book to you, otherwise I say go look for another book."
2,Not practice,"For me whose a little time to read, this book is useless. Too crowded and too many theories."
2,The book was written in 2004 and needs to be updated,"Although the project management section is informational, the book was written in 2004 and needs to be updated to today's standard of project management and internet processes."
5,Great Book!,"A great book for any web professional. It goes into detail about managing projects. Myself being a web freelancer, I found the book very helpful. It also gives you sample forms in which you can use with you own clients. The people that wrote this book must be amazing organized. They add a sense of flair to the book that others cannot convey as easily as they do it.A warning to all:This book DOES NOT actually go into detail about the web design itself, except for a couple small examples. It talks more about the process than the design."
3,Car Vent Clips are too Short,"The title of this review says it all. I installed this item on my Honda Civic. Because the vent clips are too short, I am unable to position the cell phone at an angle that suits my purpose. Using it with another phone, a Blackberry, I find it hard to keep the phone securely in place. When I have to press buttons while the phone is on the cradle, the phone comes loose and falls off rather easily. The smaller phone (a Samsung flip phone) fares much better."
3,Not amazing but does the job.,This holds the iphone 4 with a case on it very firmly. Only real problem is you can't turn it so the phone is in portrait orientation. That's kind of a bummer when using the iphone gps functions. Angle and position depends on where the air conditioning vent is. Not perfect but gets the job done.
2,Just Not Compatible,"I have an HTC Evo.I added a skin for protection. With the skin, the phone does not fit. Without the skin, it's a hard SHOVE and I cringe every time, knowing I am damaging my phone. If this item expanded, then I am sure it would work, but for the newer touch smart phones, this is way too slender. If my EVO doesn't fit, an iPhone won't fit. Trying to take it off, the pieces all broke inside my vent. So sad it did not work out!"
3,Mixed review,I was a bit disappointed by its old-style look and lack of detail. Durability is questionable as it is not very flexible. Time will tell.
3,It's good but not great.,"One of the arms on this unit, the left side, is loose and wiggly. It works. It does what it is supposed to but the left arm had to be over to be tight so the arms on the mount are not even. For the price I can't complain really but do believe there are better mounts for the same or slightly more money."
4,best movie ever!,"The movie is the best. I love the old school songs on the track. Only one I don't like is at the end when it's just sound, I'm guessing for the last part of the movie. Other than that, awesome!"
5,I was Harpooned!,"From the variety, to the creativity and musicality, I was harpooned by Greg 'Fingers' Taylor and 'Harpoon Man'! The various styles of blues numbers represented on the CD were great. Each number holds its own. As an harp player, I appreciated his chops, tone, and inventiveness on each number, especially on 'Harpoon Man' and 'Dixie Diner'. His take on Little Walter's, 'Too Late', soars with punch, swing and guts! Muddy Water's, 'Can't Get No Grindin'', really romps! And 'Last Night' hits home with mood and sensitivity, like a number played during the last set of a late night gig!It's great to hear a band, and CD, that can really play the blues with the variety, sensitivity, power and dynamics the blues really deserves! If you can find this CD, like I recently did, get it...and get harpooned!"
2,um no,"well, i dont have this cd, but i saw them live a while ago at the troubadour in la.they opened for the hippos(definetly get the hippos cd),and werent great. i dont really remember their songs that they played thouhg. now that i hear them they are ok. i might get this cd...."
4,GOOD CD,"I saw a show in which Lefty played. They were so awesome. I especially love the song ""Girls"" (although we all know no one needs to put an end to us girls)They have a good sound, and the music is very enjoyable! I recommend this. !"
2,Short and not sweet,"I was disapointed with this book, as most of the information could be found on the website by the author. I read this paperback in 1 1/2 hours, and didn't feel it deserves the $21.95 price tag.Most of the book is stories about people dealing with the issues and very few tips...only secrets. I feel $5.95 would be a fair price for a small paperback....save your money and go to the website."
4,Thunder Point,Once we found we had to buy a new player (region free) we loved the movie. First book we had read by Jack Higgins and were anxious to watch the movie. Had never heard of the regions and Thunder Point wouldn't play on our player as it had been filmed in England. Once we got the new player it was a very enjoyable movie. Just couldn't get my head around Kyle McClatchin as Sean Dillon though !!!!
1,Life is too short!,"I have to say, I am a big Jack Higgins fan but hadn't read this book and foolishly bought the DVD first. I doubt now whether I will bother with the book. Having seen ""The Eagle has Landed"" in the cinema years ago I assumed this would be another cracker - how wrong I was, as from beginning to end it was truly awful. Hammy acting, poor plot, poor casting, too much knife violence seemingly just for the sake of it and the ending - OMG it was like they left it open to make a sequel!! Please preserve us from that."
1,Should have been called 'Blunder Point',"Other than the title of the movie, and the characters names, this film bore no relation to the book. Even minor items, such as Dillon's history was completely altered, not to mention that MacLachan was completely inappropiate for the part of a short, fair haired sardonic Irishman.A complete waste of time."
1,Unfortunate,"This was a very predictable movie until the end which I will not give away, but don't expect resolution or any happy ending."
3,Identifying Issues,This is a very good book on identifying the reason behind a variety of emotional issues with which we all deal. Several real examples are cited. We're all the result of our past and the people who have influenced us. It's important to realize this and consider the impact we're now having on others.
2,Typical Smalley and Trent,"If you love Gary Smalley and John Trent, you'll like this book! But if you are looking for something new and refreshing about an unusual theme, you might well be disappointed. Smalley and Trent have taken what could have been an extremely dynamic topic and melded it around their common themes of family and relationships. The end product - full of their usual case studies - has little in common with the scripture references foundational to the book: the Blessings as seen in the Old Testament, with special emphasis on the patriarchal blessings found in Genesis. Specifically, they have taken what was meant to be a unique event in one's life and turned it into everyday occurrances through touch; spoken, meaningful words; and parents' commitment to see blessings through in their children's lives. Of course, these are important elements of relational life, but the Old Testament Blessing is so much more. Unfortunately, this time around, Smalley and Trent missed the mark."
3,A bit on the big side,"I actually purchased these not for recipes but to use to protect the cards in a game. Unfortunately, while they are called 3x5 card protectors, they are actually oversized by about 3/8 of an inch in both directions. They're workable, as long as you don't need to shuffle..."
2,"Pick up ""Night Ranger's Greatest Hits"" instead","This CD and the one entitled"" Night Ranger's Greatest Hits are almost identical, but are different in this way:""Best"" contains ""I Did It For Love"". ""Greatest"" contains, instead, ""Rumours In The Air"" and ""Restless Kind"". The other 10 tracks on each CD are the same. So, which one to buy? My choice is the one with the extra track. Also, in my opinion, both tracks on ""Greatest"" are better than the one on ""Best"".In addition, here's hoping that the band or record label decides to release a true ""Greatest Hits"" or ""Best Of"" album that will contain about 15 or 16 songs. Or maybe a multi-disc compilation that will include some rare tracks.Night Ranger fans would surely delight to see something like that."
4,"""Rumours"" are not in the air!","One of my favorite songs from the original ""Greatest Hits"" is ""Rumours In The Air"" because unlike most of their other songs, it has a distinctive, creative, in-depth sound. It was more than just a pretty face.I bought the 20th Century Masters compilation because its sound quality is remastered and superior to the original compilation. But after buying it, I realized that ""Rumours"" was mysteriously left off. This is inexcusable considering both the unused space left on the disc, and the inclusion of the cookie cutter 80's song ""I Did It For Love."" To remove a song that is highly creative and unique to include a song that is highly typical and draped in 80's bland taints this collection.One day the recording industry will start offering true ""greatest"" hits packages so people won't have to download the songs needed to fill in the gaps left on the CD's they buy!"
4,"""Night Ranger Is In Town"".","This is a great compilation CD, has a balanced combination of melodical soft rock/pop and hard rock songs. Their big hit, ""Sister Christian"" is gladly not alone but accompanied by powerful & beautiful other tracks icluding, ""Sing Me Away"", ""You Can Still Rock In America"", ""When You Close Your Eyes"", ""Sentimental Street"", ""Four In The Morning"" and ""I Did For Love"". As I came to like this band through their soft rock sounds, I'm not very comfortable with their hard rock moods in ""Don't Tell Me You Love Me"", ""Eddie's Comin' Out Tonight"" and ""Goodbye"". It's a highly recommended compilation by this talented hard rock band and they are really in town!"
3,Secret of their Success!,"Night Ranger is best known for it's song, Sister Christian, but I was surprised by the other songs on this compact disc including ""The Secret of My Success"" which was used for the film starring Michael J. Fox. They were one of the hair bands of the 1980s. In this collection, they still rock as ever and bring back nostalgia about that time period. It's a great buy for the price and the songs remind me of simpler times. If you love music from that era, you will like and appreciate Night Ranger's contributions to music and videos. Who could ever forget Sister Christian's music video? The song entitled Secret of My Success could be their anthem."
2,"Primascan 2400P, no go under XP","This is a good scanner if you have Win9x, but it will not run under XP!! There are no drivers for XP for this scanner. If you have XP get the 2400U instead!"
1,Don't Buy its a piece of junk doesnot support winXP,Prima Scan doesnot have a Windows XP driver so its waste to buy the colorado 2400p. It will only work if you have win2000 or win 9x. It was really stupid for a company not to provide a winxp driver.
2,Was great at first... but garbage now!,"When I first purchased this laptop from Future Shop I was overjoyed with the performance.It has been 3 months since, and now it gets extremely hot, the casing has warped all over the place from the heat, and anytime I open any application other than Internet Explorer or try to play music, everything grinds to a halt and then the laptop just turns off! What a waste of money!"
3,Power of a desktop,"I purchased this item and was happy as a lark. The only major dissapointment is the battery life. After a full refresh as described in the manual, I only managed to get one hour and fifteen minutes with general wifi browsing. I was heartbroken and returned it. One other thing, the rubber pads are easy to come off. If all the foot pads are to be lost this would cause poor air circulation leading to overheat and failure. If you are planning to constantly use this machine with a/c power then there is nothing to worry about. It is one of the best deals out there. Tech support speaks American English. Enjoy a great value!"
3,Just OK -- and that's if your into fixing things !,"Averatec notebooks are a crapshoot.They are either great or garbage. I managed a really good price on mine and still feel cheated.Tech supports answer to my issues was ""send it back"" and this was right out of the box .Lucky for me my husband is pretty handy with computers and had the problems identified and fixed in about an hour. (replaced memory and optical drive).His description of this laptop ""a desktop crammed into a small case without any ventilation"" and some other things I won't put in print . Would I buy another Averatec ? I don't think so ."
4,Glorious filming/production,Excellent film of Britten's opera Gloriana. J. Barstow as Gloriana is superb. Beautiful and audacious directing. It's well worth it.
4,"Satisfying, robust Mozart with a small orchestra of virtuosos","The English Chamber Orchestra were a great group of musicians, better than their contemporaries, the Academy of St. Martin in the Field, and on EMI the young Daniel Bareenboim put them to good use. These Mozart symphonies sound vigorous and full of life, far removed from the dainty, effete performances so common at the time (or the wind-up mechanaisms one hears today). Thanks to the smaller ensemble, Moart's wonderful wind solos come thorugh vividly, with great color and ebullience.Why not five stars, then? I keep having the prevailing impression that I've heard better performances. They all come form older conductors like Klemperer, Furtwaangler, Beecham, and Bernstein, who big-band Mozart may not appeal to you at all. But, oh, how much more emotional depth and inner sensitivyt those maestros had. Even so, Barenboim is extremely good, and ona different day I wouldn't begrudge him that last star."
5,Love it!,"This album is way better than I ever expected! It's my first Yo La Tengo album, and I highly recommend it for people who are new to them also. I especially like the song ""little eyes"". The base guitar is so rad!"
2,Not a great recording,I enjoy Julio Iglesias music -- but this one is not a great recording -- probably because it is live and obviously done a few years ago when they didn't have the best equipment to record. But I like it anyway -- just don't get it if you are thinking great recording.
2,Dissapointing,The quality was terrible as was the filming. I was dissappointed in it. I would not have gott\ it if I had known.
4,Lets go for nice coastal drive...,"A great NuGroove album of various artists who want to entertain and arouse your senses. Nice ebb and flow all the way to the end. If your listening at home then all you need is a nice girl and a chilled bottle of red wine. If your on the road, a nice ride plus a nice girl and turn on the fun beach boundfolks!"
2,This is not a toy.,"This is a good collectors item for young girls. The line provides one of these for birth, each birthday and marriage. This is not a toy. It is a traditional gift for grand daughters and a good buy. If Amazon listed it as a traditional collectors item I would rate it a five in every category."
1,Josef 4 year doll sold by Amazon,I was suppose to receive TWO of these Josef 4 year dolls as replacements for two that I had originally purchased but were BOTH damaged/defected. Still sitting here with only ONE replacement and no word of getting my other one. This is ridiculous.The original two I had received for my daughters were damaged. One had a crack line around one side of it's head. The other one's facial details such as it's mouth had been painted literally to one side of the face making the overall look of her look extremely awkward.
5,AKIRA Collection I,"A visual masterpiece. Equal to it's animated counterpart. Katsuhiro Otomo at his very best..'AKIRA.' This, his foremost installment of the epic graphic novel, is well worth viewing; a work of art in which the complexity and visual manipulation are both mesmerizing and awe-inspiring. An undertone to the rewards of an emotionally stirring storyline: one which traverses the realms of a surreal dream..hypnotic, inducing the kind of profound, visual intoxication that only Otomo can achive; this, his ultimate medium of expression."
5,Fee + Toto = GREAT MUSIC,"Most of Toto is here with Fee and some writing by Richard Marx. Sure, this LP killed the Tubes group (see my Love Bomb review for the details) but Fee sure put out a gem! The music is very catchy and well performed. It has a very 80s sound, but still beats the pants off of most of today's new releases. Every time I play this CD for someone I am consistently asked who the artist is and where did I get the CD. So get yours too!"
1,It's Junk!,film quality is poor; sound is not sync'd with picture;and it's not funny the way i rememember Pigmeaat Markham to be
1,"BEWARE! THIS IS NOT ""THE GRASS ROOTS"". IT'S A REMAKE!","Watch out! This is a remake, and is decidedly NOT done by The Grass Roots"". It's a remake album by Goldenlane Records, who hires musicians to record copies. They even went so far as to create a period cover design to net the most unsuspecting buyers possible... As remakes go, it's pretty bad... So, listen, and you can make up your own mind..."
3,Factory Second - not very good remakes,These are not the original hit recordings and they did not do a nice job of re-performing them. I got this used and fortunately the store will take it back. If you like re-hashes this might be okay for you. Naah.
5,Time of the Wolf,Excelent book. Keep me spellbound and reading. Didn't want to put it down.Certainly a keeper!!!Read this one today.Keep up the good writing.
2,product needs more information,I would be careful buying this product because all that gets shipped is the cd with NO directions to set up. There are things such as product keys that were not available on the disc or the disc insert that you need in order to set up the product on your computer to transfer to the pda. When asking sanford for help they weren't much help either. if you're savvy with technology it probably won't be a problem- but i spent money on something i now can't even use... and i'm not that computer illiterate.
4,A great resource for students learning to be an CCNA,"As a Cisco Academy instructor, this book is a great supplement to the Cisco CCNA Academy course. The way the vocabulary and terms are arranged can be very helpful. The illustrations are also well done! I particulary like the way the ""tips"" and ""notes"" are arranged throughout the book in a well planned manner. Overall, a book you can't do without if trying to understand networking basics."
3,"a littel to general, but very easy to understand","This book could have went a little deeper in content. What subjects it did cover it coverd in a very easy to understand maner, and I loved the explanations. I just wish there was more explanations to read. Well onto the big book I won't really know if this book helped till I see if I can understand the big book."
4,Excellent book if you are new to networking.,"If you do not know much about networks, this would prove to be a great book for you. This book explains even the most complex networking concepts in plain and simple english, which makes it easier for a beginner to understand. This book will help you build a strong networking foundation, upon which you can build your networking career. If you are planning to take the CCNA exam, it would be a good idea to read this book before you go onto the mainstream CCNA prep books like Sybex's CCNA prep book by Todd Lamelle. If you are a beginner, the mainstream CCNA books would not make much sense. This book was a great help to me and can be to you also. Good luck on your CCNA exam!!!"
2,Ok if studying for MS NetEss but not CCNA.,"Only covers basics, full of mistakes and very basic networking concepts. Maybe says the word Enable three times in the book. spend your money on a Todd Lammle book, you'll be happy you did."
1,Can't Believe They Didn't Get Sued For This,"While it is a great idea to have a CD release of the original ""Cold Spring Harbor"" from the Family Records Label, this CD is a poor product. The sound is transfered off a vinyl copy that sounds like it has been significantly worn out. Had anyone thought about locating a master tape for this??? Anyhow, based on how much litigation was caused in Billy's career over the whole ""Cold Spring Harbor"" disaster (hiding out in L.A. for 6 months in a piano bar-the inspiration for ""Piano Man""), it suprises me greatly that Billy Joel and Columbia Records have not filed suit to stop this release. This is for completists ONLY. If you have to have EVERYTHING under the Billy Joel name, here you go. If you aren't OBSESSIVE (I will admit to it), DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! Hopefully, someone will one day release a GOOD version of the original Family Records album on CD. Until then, this isn't it!"
2,"Collection complete, but will you listen more than once?","I jumped at the chance to listen to Cold Spring Harbor at the correct speed. But after laboring through the awful sound quality of the Harbor Sessions, I was left debating which version I preferred - the clean version with a slighly higher Billy Joel voice, or the scratchy one at correct speed. The Harbor Sessions was really tough on my Billy Joel-loving ears."
3,"Bad audio quality, but interesting content","This CD is pretty neat because you can hear the Billy Joel CD, Cold Spring Harbor, a little slower and it sounds more like Billy. The extended ""You Can Make Me Free"" is cool but you probably need to be a die-hard Billy Joel fan to find this CD worth it. If you don't need every Billy Joel CD I would go with the Columbia release of Cold Spring Harbor."
3,The harbor Sessions,"I will agree with all the above reviews, only the die-hard Billy Joel fans will really appriciate this release, however I like the 1970ish feel to the record. As for an abouve review, this IS the original recording tape and it has been repaired to the most it will ever be. I will admit the timing is a bit off but what the heck, it only took 30 years to get it right finally, dont complain!"
1,What a disappointment...,"I really enjoy sci-fi the likes of I Robot from Isaac Asimov and many many Joe Haldeman stories, but this particular collection is terrible. I'm about 8 stories in and there's not even one gem so far. I believe this book should be re-titled to - "" The Ultra-Contemplative Super-Pseudo-Intellectual's Guide to Boring Science Fiction Stories. Sorry, it's just not a very good book."
2,I couldn't put it together!!,"I'm not rating the furniture or Simplicity, I'm rating Baby Universe for shipping the wrong furniture. I didn't notice that they sent a combo of the Walnut and Cherry changing tables from the Ellis line. So, when my friends and I attempted to put it together, the screw holes on the cabinet pieces didn't line up. I thought that maybe it was me, so I called my cousin, the handy-man, to see if he could fix it. As we looked closer, we noticed that some pieces were lighter than others. Simplicity instructs you to call them if something's wrong and I did. They're sending an entirely new unit to me and will pay for shipping to return the faulty/unmatched unit. I'm due in 2 weeks so I'm purchasing a playpen/changing table/bassinet in case I deliver before Simplicity does."
3,Beautiful unit but many probloms,"I was so excited when I saw this piece of furniture because it is classy, elegant, just exactly how I want my nursery to look. When I recieved it via mail, it was in parts to be assembled. 50% of the parts had minor scratches and/or dings (bummer) and one critical part was destroyed. I called the 1-800 # and was pleasently suprised that the operator was happy to send out replacement parts for the unit ASAP. Then I tried to put the thing together and 6 hours later drawers don't fit right, hinges seem chiep, another bummer. But it looks great. It just isn't that practical. Definatly a piece for a mechanically inclined person to put togethert!"
2,don't put it together yourself,"I agree with the other reviews. We experienced similar problems when trying to assemble our changing table, and it was all because of the poor quality of craftmanship in the SIMPLICITY product. We finally had to contact the store where we purchased the product, and they generously removed the one we couldn't fit together and replaced it with one that their furniture assembly specialists put together for us. it only took us about 2 months from the purchase date to finally end up with a properly assembled product.Then we opened the Ellis crib box to find a slat in the front panel was warped. Here we go again."
3,Good Show,"This was a fairly good DVD of a short concert by Phoebe Snow. Back in 1977 I was just out of college and living with a roommate in another college town in Tennessee. We got free tickets to a Phoebe Snow concert. I only remembered that she had sung ""Poetry Man"" in the past and I liked it, so why not go for free? It was one of the best concerts I ever went to, especially because since the warm-up band didn't play after they got there, Ms. Snow apologized for them and did their warm-up plus an extended concert. She was at her best then. I saw her once more here in Florida about 2 years later and again she was great. This DVD is a studio produced concert in Germany from 1989 and definitely not the Phoebe Snow of times past. She had been through a lot in those 10 years and was still hanging in there which I give her a lot of credit for. A good addition to a fan's library, but not a very good look at a great singer in her prime."
3,In Concert - Phoebe Snow,"My wife and I saw a Phoebe Snow Concert at the Paramount Center For The Arts in Peekskill, NY, about a month ago where we live. We had excellent seats; 5th Row Center Orchestre, and enjoyed the truly live performance immensely. I had rarely heard Phoebe Snow but had heard of her. Her new ensemble was excellent all around and her perfomance was great as I have already said. When I heard her Live Concert DVD, I was disappointed, though it was O.K. to watch and listen to. I guess the saying ""you had to be there"" has proved true in our case."
2,ALTERED STYLE,"If you didn't like Phil Woods At Montreux (1970), you won't like this 1957 effort either. In an attemt not to sound like his same old self Phil altered his tone and style significantly, making matters worse to my ears. If you're a Phil Woods hound check him out under pianist George Wallinton's name - Jazz for the Carriage Trade- The New York Scene and Jazz at Hotchkiss (studio recording) All feature the trumpet of Donald Byrd as well. Phil sounds like himself on these sessions from 1956 and 1957. Sugan with trumpeter Ray Copeland is good too, despite the cover art - 3 Charlie Parker tunes and 3 Woods originals. Phil didn't play clarinet in those days. While you're at it take The Youngbloods too, Phil, Donald Byrd and a rhythm section led by Al Haig. All this is the best of Phil Woods from the mid-late 50's"
1,Product not as pictured,"The item came quickly, but it was very disappointing. I always hesitate to buy things from the internet because they might not be what they seem to be and if it is wrong or doesn't fit, the return procedure is somewhat unsure. Well, it happened with this item. It was nothing like the photos on the package or the web. It was shorter and I was especially unhappy that it was made from a totally different material. Not even close to what I wanted or what the photos indicated. I followed the return procedure 2 weeks ago and haven't received my refund nor any contact from the seller since. I'm hoping my credit card gets credited. I am extremely unhappy with this product and this company at this point."
4,Well written book on the Immune System and Healthy Function,"A lot of this information I was already aware of, but I am so excited that there is a book out there that covers it in greater detail than I can. She is so right on what she assesses as necessary for the immune system to function in a healthy way. However, I am surprised that vitamin D wasn't on her list of the top 10 immune boosting items. After vitamin D has been so touted even amongst naturopaths, you would think its necessity would have been highlighted greater. But thats okay, still a book to for sure get on your shelves. A ""must have"" book."
3,"Great in 98se, Trouble in XP","Installed like it should in Windows 98. Worked great for months under that OS. But when I did a format of the hard drive and a clean install of Windows XP, I was amazed when XP detected the drivers and put them in automatically. Great, right? Well, it did not enable the ONE-TOUCH features or either of the card readers... It only installed the scanner driver. So I made sure it was the latest version of the driver, then put in the paperport software. It worked the first time but has not successfully found the scanner on boot-up since. Consider this a cautionary tale! While windows xp seems superior in all regards, I now no longer have a working scanner and the Visioneer website doesn't cover any such issue. In fact, except for a link to SELL the 7700, they barely mention the unit."
2,Between the lines,"I love the idea of this scanner and when it works, it works great. I had one for use in a journalism lab at a univesity. At first it was great. Then lines started showing up. Small lines soon became big black bars. Numerous calls for assistance resulted in little help. I wanted a replacement and finally after much effort got one from Visioneer. The replacement did not include the USB cable, software or manual. And guess what? It scans with lines in every other scan. I just haven't had the energy yet to fight for a replacement of the replacement. Be patient when calling for help. Visioneer must have one line and it is always busy."
3,LOVE IT---WHEN IT WORKS!!!,"THIS IS A GREAT IDEA FOR SUCH A SCANNER. HOWEVER, I THINK IT NEEDS TO REMOVE SOME BUGS. I HAD TO REINSTALL IT 7 TIMES AND HAD TO CALL FOR SUPPORT (NOT TOLL-FREE) FOUR TIMES AND I STILL CAN'T GET THE BUTTONS ON THE SCANNER TO WORK. HAVE TO USE IT THROUGH THE SOFTWARE. THOUGHT OF TAKING IT BACK FOR A REFUND, BUT THERE IS NO OTHER PRODUCT ON THE MARKET LIKE IT. IT IS TO TAKE THE COMPACT AND SMART MEDIA DISKS. I GOT IT TO WORK ONCE AND BOY WAS I THRILLED. SO FAR I NEED MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GET THOSE BUTTONS TO WORK. I AM DETERMINED. I WANT IT SO BAD."
4,Detecting Forgeries,"Detecting Forgery in Fraud Investigations is an effective guide for those requiring a basic understanding of the fundamentals involved in handwriting analysis. The book is organized to provide investigators, and others involved in determining the authenticity of handwriting, a practical approach to the issues involved in examining handwriting, including sample exercises.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in developing and using the knowledge they would gain by applying the principles of detecting forgeries Ms. Brayer provides in her book."
1,1 star is generous,"Needs to be taken back to the drawing board. Ideas would work, in a utopian sadistic society!"
3,International Harvester Shop Manual Series 300 300 Utility,"This manual is good for a quick look at what should be there. If you are a tractor mechanic and familiar with other tractors, this is probably a good manual for you.If you are a novice it's probably not worth your money, try and find a real IH shop manual. This one doesn't have enough detail if you're trying to do it for the first time."
2,Better Collections Out There,"I was not wholly impressed with this collection of transcendentalist works. The selections do not completely flow and the introductory material is often repetitive. I also did not completely agree with what are considered ""essential"" texts. It left me a bit confused at times. But probably a good intro to Transcendentalism if you are new to that genre."
4,Bouvier with Bowel Distress,Our dog was having bowel issues and this was NOT fun for anyone in the family. He is on a consistent diet of good food and otherwise healthy. We took him to the vet and they gave us some heavy duty meds but we didn't want to keep him on those. Then we had him on acid inhibitor for a few months but any time we took him off the pills his diarrhea got worse. I didn't like having him on the meds but was aware of probiotic for people so when I saw it for animals I thought we'd give it a try. It worked great and I know folks are concerned about the probiotic dying unrefrigerated etc in transit but since a dog can't respond to a placebo I have to think that it is working. If I forget to give him the BP he has stomach issues so it doesn't seem that he simply improved overall. I would definitely recommend giving this product a shot if you have a pet that is having bowel issues.
5,It worked for my pups!,"I'm about to place my second order for Animal Essentials Plant Enzymes & Probiotics. I am very pleased with the results I've had with both of my dogs. One pup suddenly developed a sensitivity to his food. He had several bouts of diarrhea and several tests and rounds of antibiotics and VERY PRICEY vet supplied probiotics. Once I switched him to a low ingredient diet (L.I.D.)and added Animal Essentials Plant Enzymes & Probiotics, he got much better and has remained well. My other pup wasn't sick, unless you count poop-eating as an illness (YUCK!). I started adding it to her food too as I thought it couldn't hurt! And low and behold, she had stopped the poop-eating! Both my pups are little (about 14 lbs each) and the amount I have to use is about an 1/8 teaspoon each meal per pup. So one bottle has lasted over 6 months! I highly recommend this!"
3,Not working yet,"I bought this three days ago and started to administer immediately. The cat loved the flavor but became a bit bloated. He has IBS and has been on Prednisone since November. The Pred worked for the first month and a half but lately the vomiting and diarrhea has returned. I have him on Evo 95% Venison soft food and use a small amount of the duck version to administer the daily pill. We also supplement with Royal Canin's Rabbit and Pea kibble. We have tried just about every kind of food, including the raw food diet for 1-1/2 years with him. Nothing has been long term effective. He is allergic to chicken, wheat, dairy and some fish. I had hoped this would help because of all the positive reviews but thus far he is the same or even a bit worse. All his labs test come back wonderful even for his age. He is 13 years old. Will try this a bit longer and consult again with his natural vet. We are hoping this starts working for him."
5,Excellent Results,"My 11 year old Golden had a persistent gas issue that drove both of us crazy. After some internet research, it became likely that this was a digestion issue as when dogs age they produce less bacteria / enzymes to break down the nutrients. I chose to try this product as it is made in the US, and has favorable reviews by other users. I add this supplement to my dogs food twice daily at the recommend dosage on the bottle. I noticed an improvement within a few days, not only was the gas problem reduced significantly, but the dog has improved energy levels. I'm generally skeptical with these types of homeopathic remedies, but this one is a real winner -- highly recommend. Been using for 3 months."
1,Cats won't eat it. :(,I sprinkle a little of this on their food and they won't eat. I looks like flour in the bottle. It makes a gross gooey mess on the inside of the bowls. Many great reviews for this was the reason I purchased but my cats (3 of them) don't like it. I use FortiFlora and they gobble that right up.
3,Hype no Bite,"Couldn't see a real difference in my dog. Used it about 2 weeks, kept in refrigerator like it said and gave with every meal. Dog ate it up without a problem so that was easy, I thought I would try something new, but, I'm sticking to the NatureVet with pre and probiotics; little bit higher in price, but, doesn't have to be refrigerated and works well for my dog. My dog was diagnosed with Giardia last year and is still having trouble with digestion; very sensitive stomach. NatureVet is the only thing that I have found to help him."
4,"So far, so good.","My dog suffers from IBS and once a month episodes of diahrrea. He is being treated with Tylan powder by our vet but it was also recommended that we put him on probiotics. This has worked great so far. Dog still gets a soft poo once in a while but nothing like he used to. I really believe it has helped keep the healthy bacteria strong in his intestines. Also, I sprinkled it on his food and he doesn't mind the taste. Lastly, I like that you have to put it in the fridge because to me it means it has solid ingredients and not a bunch of preservatives.If you want full details of the ingredients just do a google search."
4,Works great for my dog,"My 2-year old 120-pound Bernese Mountain Dog has always had soft stool. And he'd get diarrhea often. After he had had a particularly bad bout of the runs on our kitchen floor (half an hour before prospective house buyers were stopping by), I talked to a pet shop owner who recommended this product. I couldn't believe how well and how immediately it worked. His poop was more solid than it had ever been in his life. It was like these were the enzymes his digestive system had always needed. I've been using it for 8 months or so now. And although its not cheap, a 10 oz. bottle will last a long time because all it takes is a small shake of it on each bowl of food. I couldn't be happier with this product."
5,Cat Rescue's favorite,Greyfoot Rescues all ages of cats. This is the best product on the market. For kittens to cool down the intestines for any kind of bowl upset. For Seniors to aid in digestion.
3,Not as Good as Some Others Out There,"I tried out this enzyme/probiotic for my dogs because my one dog has delveloped an egg allergy, and the product I was using was egg based. After switching, my allergy dog tends to have more tummy noises (so I worry about digestive upset), and my other dogs bad breath has returned (the old brand of probiotics took care of the problem). I will have to keep looking."
2,Didn't work for me,"I didn't feel like the product was working as well as it should have.Too bad, after all the positive reviews i wanted this product to work. We have used thePurina Veterinary Diets Fortiflora Canine, 30 Sachets Per Boxbefore and that has worked well.Because of the higher price of both of these i switched toVetri-Mega Probiotic (120 Caps)and they have been working great, and less mess to boot because they come in capsule form that i just drop in his food (he is a lab and hasn't minded the taste of any of the probiotics he has ever had, whether it be the powder or a capsule).At least i found an option that works better and is cheaper as well for my dog. Try the Vetri-Mega first and see."
4,provides great digestive support,"I have show dogs/working dogs. This product was first recommended by a holistic vet when my dogs got salmonella poisoning from grain-free kibble. After the dogs recovered from this illness, I use it anytime they are showing or sledding and their bodies are under stress. Also use it for indoor DSH cat to assist with her excessive grooming and hairball relief."
1,Product causes constipation in my dog,"I've used this product on and off for over a year. Every time I use it again, on my vet's suggestion, within 12 hours my dog's stools will become hard, difficult to pass and even chalky. My vet sells this product and refuses to listen to my complaints, but after trying it over 20 times and seeing the same results, severe constipation, I'm no longer using it."
2,Made My Babies Sick,I gave this to my two mixed breed dogs and two cats. It made one of my cats throw up every day I gave it to her and one of my dogs threw up after every meal I gave it to her as well. My other dog did not physically get sick (that I saw) but he was coughing and hacking a lot which is very unlike him. I contacted Amazon and I'm returning for a refund.
2,Might Be A 5 Star Product But Didn't Work For My Dog,My dog did not care for this powder at all and his stools actually became loose from it. I guess he didn't need it. I was hoping it would help his itchy skin and ears. Guess I will keep searching for an answer to his allergies.
4,Must for any brother,"As an older brother it is your duty to swear by the book, ""Stamp them out before they multiply!"" This is original, funny, and very characteristic of the litigation free 80's. I mean, ""Wow!"" Topics handled in this book were never for kids. Today this is on the TV all the time. I scanned some images, but some, I just can't put here. Not much text, the cartoons are a riot. I can't believe he said that, and that, and that...OMG. Chain-saw surgery, near-sighted rabbi, send it to San Diego w/an ear ring...unbelieveable. I'm thinking compulsive editiorial cartoonist, however the dedication page is true to the underlining theme of the book, 'Dedicated to Americans...who'll buy anything'. If you don't like it, grow up."
2,not as helpful as i would like,"this book shed some light on what i was going through, however it also mad me angry and worsened some of my 'symptoms' (for lack of a better word). Its mostly stories of jealous people, rather than help in explaining and fixing any problems you have. I suggest non violent communication books first, if that doesnt help then maybe try this. good luck"
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.,The book was ok it was not what i thought it was going to be nice & short well written but it didnt real give details on how to over come your problem is just told storys of different people i would of liked if it would have went more in dept of how to over come jealousy issue.
2,Focuses too much on the non-jealous mate.,I feel that this book hasn't given me any solutions to overcome my jealous behavior. There are some solutions but they are not very detailed in how to use them through different stages and situations in a relationship. I think that this book is more helpful for those people who are dating or married to someone who is jealous. Overall I think that if you are a jealous person looking for a book to help you change then I think that you should look for another book.
5,Truly Helpful,"This book is amazing! I read this book when I was in a relationship that I was always being possessive of my boyfriend, and always would get jealous even if he would look at a picture of another girl. In my mind, I thought that he shouldn't be able to look at other people, because he was my boyfriend. This book helped me overcome my jealousness, just not of my boyfriend, but also for others as well. I find that I am no longer possessive of the guys that I date in relationships now, because this book has helped me understand why I felt the need to act that way, and how to overcome your actions. I would definently recommend this book to anybody who does not understand why they are so jealous and or possessive of their significant others, or also for people who's significant other has told them they need to 'get over it'. Definently MONEY WISELY SPENT on this book!"
1,terrible,"bad beat, bad lyrics, annoying hook, poser rapper and a pair of bad ""crunk artists"". Put those all into one song, and you have a radio hit that appeals to the masses, but is just painfully terrible. Avoid at all costs"
5,another great album,"Vania does it again with this mesmerising album. Notable tracks include, A Manga Rosa and Seio da Bahi. This album is a must for followers of this great singer"
5,Ibuprofen Works,"My life before Ibuprofen was rough. I was in the medical field, driving each day, working a different shift(s) each day, and on some days working 16-18 hours on little sleep. Headaches plagued me, along with sore muscles and a sore neck from having a hand always on the steering wheel.Ibuprofen saved my life. There is no other pain reliever that cures my headaches within 30 minutes like Ibuprofen does. When I pop 2 Ibuprofens, I know with confidence that my headache will be gone in 20-30 minutes. And it works 99.9% of the time.Ibuprofen cures stress headaches, sinus headaches, caffeine headaches, headaches from little sleep, and headaches from too much intense work. The only thing Ibuprofen doesn't handle as well as I'd like is muscle aches. Despite this drawback, Ibuprofen is the best in my book. I always keep a bottle with me in my car, at work, and where ever I go.If you haven't tried Ibuprofen, you need to."
3,Annoying but diverting,"This book is a high-level exploration of some ideas around design. While intelligent, the book is ultimately disappointing. It bites off more than it can chew, as it were, which leads to a frustrating reading experience. On the positive side, the author is well-informed and committed to his work. On the negative side, the book is badly written, needlessly biting in tone, and ungrounded in the very design constraints that the author would say make designers tick. Also, it seems like the author's view of designers verges on hero worship at times, which some other design critics and researchers have avoided. The book contains some interesting ideas, but the ceaseless neologisms and the slightly eccentric page design distracted from these ideas. All in all, a potential reader may prefer to tackle a classic such as ""The Reflective Practitioner"" or ""Designing for People"" on the design side, or perhaps ""Our Choice (by Al Gore) on the environmental side."
3,viridian excess,"I was disappointed in the book. I'm really more interested in the offshoring footprint and age discrimination footprintof purchases I make, than the carbon or sustainability footprint. I do applaud Sterling for cautioning about the surveillancepotential of ""spimes"" or trackable objects in general. I'll be interested in seeing which government uses electronic trackingto systematically kill its opponents and dissidents. It will also be interesting to see who ultimately benefits from data miningthe information trails that trackable objects generate. I doubt that the bulk of the benefit will accrue to the public!"
2,"good idea, poor book","i had high hopes but was vey dissapointed, fortunatley it is a very short book so i stuck it out, (to be fair there are one or two worthwhile parts) i really did not like the writing style a lot of waffel to make pritty staight forward points. the general idea is quite valid and interesting but poorly extrapolated and supported. just watch the ted talk from bruce."
2,"Nice observations, unacceptable English","""Everyone can't be a designer."" , which the author wrote, is NOT equivalent to ""Not everyone can be a designer."".Look up De Morgan's rules, for example, or the Chicago Book of Style, or Strunk and White, or ... just get a good editor,because such poor exposition gets in the way of reading the ideas.That said, the ideas are excellent; Mr. Sterling just needs a real English-savvy editor."
2,This book is a little too short.,"This book is 'wafer thin', I would recommend John ThakorsIn the Bubble: Designing in a Complex Worldinstead, it is goes into a lot more depth, but is still a sci-fi."
2,"Cheap, poorly made license plate frame","The metal part of the frame is great, and most likely long lasting, but the lettering are stick on letters held on with poorly made adhesive that doesn't hold on very well, the letters come off when either washing your car or in a heavy rain, or if you have a trunk mounted frame, when you close your trunk even the letters pop off, I lost two of my letters already, had to use black marker for now until I find better frames. Also doesn't come with screws, but has the caps which don't even fit the standard screws that come on my 2008 Jeep Liberty, so I couldn't even use the Jeep screw head covers. I guess you get what you pay for, I bought them when they were on sale for $6.99 each and I bought two of them."
3,Your kids might like it,"Diana Gallagher provides us with a fun but light read featuring a few of the more fun but lesser characters from Deep Space Nine: Nog and Jake, whose adventures tend to be more comedic than dangerous as a rule. There have been perhaps too many holodeck-goes-wild stories in this universe, but this one is pretty good (but not great) for the type. As an artist, I have to say, though, that Todd Cameron Hamilton's artwork was a bit flat, stilted and unconvincing in parts, not up to the standard of most Star Trek artwork."
2,best that can be expected from young adult DS9,"This series isn't the best, but it is a readable book (unlike Warped)"
5,One of the few things that really do two things at once...,"Bought these for dedicated hiking socks. They claim to be constructed so there's an inner layer and outer. Although you can readily see this, I can say after hiking in them for months that they're the best hiking socks I've worn. Normally I use a thin inner sock with a thicker outer sock for cushioning; with these I don't need to. Sometimes with a single sock you'll get rubbing. I didn't with these. Very cushioned with out any bulky seams or points. Wore them in 100+ weather and although a bit warm it was fine. I have three pair now and will stock up whenever I see them on sale so I don't have to mess with finding socks for a while. Simply can't beat these socks in my opinion."
4,You will know the end,"The story of this two brothers is amazing. Nevertheless you'll know the end of it at half book and that makes you lose some interest in the book. It has too many coincidences but the book will keep you reading all the time. It has to many characters and that makes the book a little hard to read. The point that I didn't like it and at the end I did, was their wife, since the start of the book I had a question: how two men can do exactly the same to a woman in bed? And the second question was: how a woman can't feel the difference between two men in bed? You will see the answer at the middle of the book. One of the answers I won't tell you which is amazing and the other is that either John and Will are really stupid or their wife is."
3,thriller?,"This book is a good read, but only a thriller for those who drive 10 miles an hour. If you want thrills, check out John Sanford and Dean Koontz."
4,Entertaining,"I was thoroughly entertained by this book and its talented writer. The characters are unique and believable. This was a suspenseful, darkly funny, and enjoyable book. There were some flaws toward the end, but I really enjoyed this one."
2,Disappointed,"Always having had a certain facination about twins, this book caught my attention fast. It maintained it up until the end where, unfortunately, it failed to deliver the climax it had built up to throughout the book and lost any sense of reality. I fear the infamous Mr. Simpson may be one of those mean, petty writers who, like the ones who wrote the last episode of Rosanne, just won't be happy until people die. No reason needed. A big disappointment."
1,Ridiculous nonsense,"I read a lot of pulp fiction, and I will readily admit to enjoying a lot of stuff that I should by rights be embarrassed to have read. But rarely have I encountered anything as sophomoric and stupid as this ridiculous excuse for a novel. Yes, it's a fast read. But thank God it is, because that's the only reason I was able to finish it. I pitched it into the nearest trash can as soon as I finished. It's not even worth giving away. Don't bother."
2,Boring,"I had heard alot about this release, and within the first minute of listening, really began to wonder what all the fuss was about. Boring, boring, boring....that's what I think of this CD. Yundi Li's smooth passagework was admirable, but he restricts himself to a small dynamic range better suited to Bach. In addition, he seems to play everything in straight time. No rubato, none! If you're looking for a good recording of the Third Sonata, try Kissin or Demidenko; both play it with far more passion and panache. For the Nocturnes - Moravec or Pires, and for the Etudes - Lortie or Wild."
5,Judge for yourself!,"I would also urge you to take with a grain of salt the pontifications of a small cliche of self-styled high priests who dismiss this release. Either you appreciate Yundi Li's artistry or you don't. But the step from ""This artist doesn't speak to me"" to ""This artist has nothing to say"" requires a leap of arrogance. Contrary to the suggestion of the naysayers, discerning intelligent listeners enthusiastically embrace this release! Listen and judge for yourself!"
5,A Masterpiece,This is perhaps the most important Islamic book that has been translated into English.
1,VERY poorly made!!,"I was very excited to receive this item, but when I did I was extremely disappointed. Besides being made of cheap material (hey its not like you plan on wearing it alot/for long periods of time) it's proportions were WAY off. The legs of it fit fine, but when i went to snap it on behind my neck, I noticed, this must have been made for a person with a midget torso and regular legs! If I did snap it on all the way, i would have had the largest camel toe possible! needless to say, i never got to actually use/wear it, and it never will be."
1,Nice but not worth the wait,"I would say that the item itself is nice but do not order from ""in his dreams"" they took a life time to ship the product. It said it would be here on a certain day and came like 4 day after their last said date."
2,The criss-cross neckline chokes you.,"The neckline was very tight on my throat as I put it on, and it was so unconfortable, there was no way I was going to wear it that way, if even for just a short period. So I didn't cross it in front and just connected it behind the neck, like a halter. Not great, but at least I was able to wear it. Otherwise, the material and size was comfortable. But I wasn't happy that I couldn't wear it as pictured. I already have a halter style, and if I would have known this would turn out the same, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Not for everyone,"I'm only 5'3 so it fit kind of big. I always have that problem with ""one size fits all"" items. The material is nice, the hole at the crotch is great and the button to keep it in place is nice too, but it just doesn't work for me. I'd recommend for anyone 5'6 or taller."
1,Review for the petroleum industry: a nontechnical guide,"The illustrations in this book are terrible. The few illustrations that this book has look like a junior high school computer graphics class made them. If you are a visual learner like me, then this book might not be the best book for your money. Needless to say, I'm disappointed. Also, the book isn't a standard text book size, so don't let the amount of pages trick you into believing that it has a lot of text and info."
5,Dandelion,This was one of the best books I have read laity. A little preachy at times but the message is great.mi read it in one sitting.
5,"DANDELION, THE EXTRAORDINARY LIFE OF A MISFIT","This book, DANDELION, by Sheelagh Mawe is AMAZING! I ordered 5 copies -- and immediately gave them out as gifts (except for 1, which I kept!!!). We ALLloved this book -- and -- I recommend it HIGHLY!!! It's a book thatcan be read AND appreciated by people of ALL ages by how the KEY-TO-LIFE journey is revealed (WHAT WE THINK ABOUT -- WE BRING ABOUT!). It's a PERFECTgift, too, for you Animal lovers!!! WF"
2,Short on Information,I guess maybe people are happy to hear from an M.D. even if he has little to say(?). There really is very little here.
4,Entertaining,I got this thinking it would be a so-so game to give me some chills. After playing I discovered it was a very entertaing game. It doesn't work well with a joystick (down-side) but still works great with keyboard. The people and enviornment are a wierd but thats what it's supposed to be. I would recommend this game.
1,lame,"dreamcatcher is getting really bad games out not so much they are bad by the type of game etc, but by how much updating you have to do to play it. in the last 2 games i have bought, post mortem and jekyll and hyde. post mortem crashes at the same point of the game...and i have been working on that for a week and i still don't know what is causing it. with this game, the keyboard didn't work, and the visuals are blurry. i did get that fixed, but the game really sucks...the controls are to hard to remember and they are jerky. Don't buy the game, i don't think it worth it...graphics are awful, can't see anything to well. i see why the added adventure company to the list, cause it is an adventure just to get the game to play."
2,Create A Card 7 Beware,"I have Create A Card Gold version 3 which works wonderfully with my Windows XP computer. I was so excited when I found this later version. However, I'm very dissapointed. With Create A Card Gold you get at least 10 cards to choose from each selection, with Create A Card 7, only 2 or 3. I think the problem is that it states that you can get 100 more graphics after registering the product. But, you can't register the product, it's no longer on the company web site. This software was released in 2007, so I guess it's just too old. The few cards it has are not that great. The address book and other options seem to be working just fine but if you're thinking of purchasing just for the cards, don't waste your money."
1,"computer reads item as ""defective""","The item, bought as a gift, arrived in an unsealed case. When inserted into the computer, read ""defective."" My cousin, home with a housebound ill husband, is not computer literate enough to know how to remedy the situation; thus, has been unable to use it. She was thrilled to get the disc, initially, since she enjoys sending cards and is unable to leave the house to buy them. This has been a disappointment for her."
1,American Greetings Creatacard select 7,"I can't write a fair assessment about the CD-rom.I have not been able to get it work,and I'm very displeased with their response. In my futile attempt to resolve this matter,they said, they have sold manyCD-Rom's and have not had problems with the product. Needless to say right now, I'm an unhappy camper.Callye Robert"
3,Nice but not for outside,The wreath is a very nice one. You have plastic apples and pears coated with a glittery and droplets decorated coating. Beautiful and with the right light the wreath sparkles festively. The white magnolia flowers are also nice ...you can move the petals that are on a copper wire probably and display the m how you like them. The only thing is that this wreath is not weather resistant and this is mainly the artificial fruits the coating peals off and falls off and leaves the white foam balls to shine but they disrupt the wreath picture.So I did the mistake to hang it outside but you just keep it inside and you will enjoy it!
5,This was the answer....,"I've read so many books over the years that did not help me achieve an orgasm through penetration only. I'm 37 and had gotten to a point where I figured I would never have one. I had my first hands-free orgasm after reading this book. Other books stress masturbation or trying different angles which never worked for me. After so many years of frustration, I'm grateful to have found this book so I highly recommend it."
4,"a complete emotional roller-coaster, tears of joy, tears of","It never lets go - from the off it grabs you by the eyeballs and by the hairs on the back of your neck. I defy anyone not to be moved by the word and music paintings on offer here. Espescially the most quiet and spine tingling song ever by this band of constant surprise. If you listen while driving - watch your speed!! You will drift over that limit with no consciousness.Buy it - be transported to the silver sands, the seagulls, the waves - the tranquillity of Western Scotland."
2,"Good band, but not a good album","This album is not one of Runrig's best, as it moves too far away from the folk roots that make this band good. The frequent spoken vocals are a bit silly, and, though heartfelt, the album is not musically excellent. If you want to buy a Runrig album (and by all means do, they're a great band), you should buy The Stamping Ground or Heartland, or the live album Once In A Lifetime."
5,The Search: Regeneration #2,"""The Search"" continues with the exciting adventures of 5 teenage clones trying to escape from the evil scientist who created them and now wants to destroy them. This is Eric's book. In book #1 Eric chose not to join the other clones feeling that he was safe with his family in Texas. However, he learns that not only is he not safe, but neither is his family when Dr. Victor and his wife kidnap Eric's sister thinking that she is one of the clones. All of the clones have some extraordinary power that helps them escape sticky situations. This book has adventure galore and is complete in itself but much more enjoyable when read after book #1, titled ""Regeneration"". This series is a real winner!"
5,It gives a touch of class to my 2007 Camry XLE,"Very nice place and easy to follow instructions very well and pay close attention to thoroughly clean the area of contact with alcohol to prevent despegue.Ya the car wash several times with water pressure as well as operate at high speed if so far after 3 months of riding, remain tight. Excellent quality. I recommend 100%."
4,A great recording,"I bought this because of Percy Jones (bass) and Simon Phillips (drums) figuring anything with these two has to jam, and this does. It's good 70's rock with a healthy dose of prog and fusion, good vocals and excellent playing."
4,Good for the price,"for under 20 bucks this is definitely worth it, the sounds comes in clear. the earpiece hurts like hell in the beginning but once u start using the scope on a daily basis (which you will need to do to practice finding the heartbeat) you kinda find and get used to positioning the earpiece in a way that doesnt hurt your ears.it takes some time to find the hearbeat but when you do it is pretty clear.i'm not sure how clear it will come through if a person is overweight, it's suppose to more difficult no matter what steth is used when that is the case...."
1,Don't buy it even though it's cheap,"I bought this because it was 'Amazon Prime' and it was labled 'Fetal Stethoscope'. It is a sorry excuse for a stethoscope. 1) The tension is so tight it hurts my ears, 2) the ear pieces are very hard plastic which is also painful, 3) If you fail to put the ear pieces in the 'right way', you will hear absolutley nothing, 4) poor quality, can hardly hear my own heartbeat, and I never heard the baby's.My advice, don't buy it. You will only be frustrated."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,I am 23 weeks pregnant and cannot hear anything with this stethoscope. I can barely hear my own heartbeat! VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1,Can't hear a thing,"I can hear my own heart beat, but at 23 weeks I have yet to hear anything from the baby with this one. I bought a regular stethoscope from WalMart and could hear some gurgling noises at least from the baby. Would not recommend this product for an expectant mother wanting to listen in on her growing baby."
1,Did not work.,Sorry to report that this item didn't work. Nothing could be heard. We purchased another one from a local medical supply store and it worked just fine. They almost looked and felt identical and all of the parts appear to be the same. We are not sure but nothing could be heard through the fetal scope. We couldn't wait for another one to be delivered as the baby came before the item could have been mailed.
3,I wouldn't purchase again,"So I am not medical professional but I found little value in this stethoscope. We bought it to listen to the heartbeat of our new little-one to-be and although my wife is now 21 weeks along we are still yet to hear any fetal heartbeat. Maybe I expected too much but in trial with this device I am not even having great luck picking up normal heartbeat from my wife of myself. Don't get me wrong, I can find our heartbeat but it isn't strong and easily distinguishable. My advice would be to save your money or buy/rent a small Doppler machine. We've done that and it has been a ton of fun to listen in on our little-one and easily monitor her heartbeat."
1,Don't waste your money!,"If you want to hear your baby's heart, find another product. I'm sure there are uses for this device but, listening to a developing fetus' heart is not one of them. By the time this product becomes effective, your baby will be big enough to produce kicks that you can feel and you'll forget all about those early months of pregnancy where you wanted to hear your baby's new beating heart."
2,Didnt really work,"I used this for weeks and couldnt hear anything. Used a regular stethoscope and viola, i could hear my baby's heartbeat. Oh well."
3,No quality control. Buyer need to do some repair on the new stethoscope.,"As someone stated, I could not hear my own heart beat using this one. After checking it, it turns out that the black melted rubber(covering the hollow cup) jam the metal tube. I use a screw driver to make a hole, and use scissors to make it wider. When it can pass air from the cup to the tube, it works well.It is cheap with absolutely no quality control."
1,this product should be discontinued,"extremely painful on the ear; heartbeat is very faint, even that of adults. the product is branded 'EVERDIXIE' not Mabis. the same is available for half the price on dixieems com. no manual/instructions."
2,"Been done before, and better","I must be missing something. When I heard that Chuck D was going to be fronting a rap/metal outfit, I thought, hell yeah!!! Chuck D and rock would be perfect for each other. However, in reality, there is very little of Chuck D on this album at all. Most of the lyrics are done by a guy that sounds remakably similar to Vanilla Ice, only with a slightly tougher voice. None of the songs stand out from the others, as after 3 or 4 listens, I couldn't hear a song and tell you what the title of the track was. This is very lackluster stuff, not even holding a candle to the aggression and pure energy of the first Body Count album. Albums like this have been done before, and have been done much better. A MAJOR disappointment. Be wary of buying!"
4,"Good sound, no jumping","Public Enemy's Chuck D and his rap-metal posse bring da noise with wailing korn-style guitars. How cool is that! It's not completly korn, but it's a sweet a** album to buy."
5,These guys rock!,"I first heard of these guys on my weekend trips to Tijuana. If you enjoy music that makes you want to get out of your seat and dance, this recording is essential. This is not for the faint hearted."
3,Below the average,I thought this DVD slightly below an average National Geographic video once there is more personal dramas than scienfic information. However I was moved by the story of a teacher with a brain tumor and his family anxiety.
4,"Very, very interesting reading","It is a very simply written autobiography that has helped me to understand why my own father had his strong opinions about sticking with ""our kind"". Morales' experiences were so much like my father's during those years. What I experienced was only a fraction of their indignities.What surprised me about this book, while reading about the struggles and demoralization of Mexicans and Mex-American, was that it didn't anger me. Instead it encouraged me to do my part in helping those that continue to struggle in this great country of ours."
5,what a fascinating life,"This is the story of a boy growing up with little, but always yearning for more and eventually achieving his goals. In a sense a modern ethnic Horatio Alger story, but with cultural respect as the goal rather than financial success. The book was definitely a page-turner, Dionicio had quite a childhood and I always wanted to know the next anecdote that would come out. At the same time, I was shocked at how my country has treated those we consider less desirable.Being biracial I look like a typical white American, and hence have no experiences of such discrimination. However, I have often wondered about what discrimination my father may have gone through, or especially what my father's parents went through when they were new Mexican immigrants to California. This is sure to be a topic of conversation next time I meet the grandparents."
1,You get what you pay for=SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This is a true example of ""you get what you pay for"". Terrible sound. You constantly have to interrupt conversations and change channels so you can hear.Just a terrible-sounding phone. Pay a little more and get something else."
1,DON'T BUY IT,"Phone never worked. Supposedly new, right out of the box...nothing but static. What a disappointment!! Save yourself the grief and don't buy it.Coby CT-P6200 900 MHz Analog Cordless Phone with Caller ID (Black)"
2,I shouldn't have bought this thing,"I bought this shredder because my previous Fellowes shredder is outstanding. This one is not. It does not cross-cut, but instead makes wide ribbons. Even narrower ribbons would be more secure. I don't like this thing at all."
3,Cross-cut paper shredder,This is a pretty good cross cut shredder. Just don't put in the maximum number of sheets (11) at the same time. The blades get easily jammed with shreds of paper and must be carefully cleaned out manually before the shredder is able to function again.
4,So far so good,"This shredder works great and it is much quicker and quieter than my previous shredder, and has no problem with what I have fed it so far. I haven't taxed it too much, and it can handle 5 sheets like it was 1. I have so far shredded one credit card and that was fine.Like all shredders, it is best to keep the bin clean or compacted once it gets near the top.No complaints (so far--owned it since Feb 06)"
1,It Jams,This shredder jams repeatedly. It's the second Fellows shredder that I have had over the years and they both jammed a lot.
5,Great Product,"This is a most wonderful product. We brought two shredders previously and stopped working for being use a few times. This shredder worth to pay a little more and knowing is dependable. We had shredded more than 20 years paperwork due to down sizing. I am sure this one will help us to go for many miles longer. Highly, highly recommanded. A very very happy owner of this product."
4,Good shredder for the money,"Works well and has a large capacity trash can. Seems powerful, doesn't bog down when shredding many sheets at once. The strips are kind of thick in my opinion, but should be plenty secure for home use."
5,Best Fellows Machine I have had,"Do not waist your money on the smaller models as they die a quick death. After years of just replacing the cheep ones over and over I got this one. This BAD BOY makes the others look like cheep toys. Bigger, Stronger, and sounds like it too. Spend a little extra money and get this one you will not be sorry!"
2,I wish I hadgone to the store,"I pruchased the PS-60/PS-65c, but when I got it home I was sorry I had not gone to the store instead of mail order. I had a previous Fellowes shredder in which the paper dumped in a basket. When the basket was full one pulled it out horizontally snd emptied it. With the new replacement one has to lift off the top which contains the heavy motor and blade assembly to empty the bin. At 88 yrs I don't need that. As a shredder it is fine, giving parellel slices from quiet smooth operatin, If I had had a better, closer look I would have seen that and avoided the heavy lifting. May be fine for a heavyweight, although I would not have wanted it at any time. It has turned out to be a real hassle BB"
5,Fellowes Powershred PS-60,"Researched the ratings on shredders.We love this shredder and will buying another one, for our winter home, in Florida."
3,does the job,"does the job fine. powers through good sized piles of paper. doesnt cross cut, but for personal use, it is adequate."
3,Not very secure.,"The unit cuts the paper in 7/32 strips, this is quite wide for a shredder. You can still read quite a bit of data on the strips. And the basket fills up fast because of the wide long strips. It does have a powerful motor and it is quiet. If you shred for too long the motor will shut down, which is fine, it keeps the motor from over heating, but there are no lights to tell you something is wrong, it will just stop working for a while."
5,A PERFECT GIFT,MADE MY 9 YEAR OLD SON VERY HAPPY ON CHRISTMAS MORNING...IT IS SOMETHING THAT HE HAS BEEN WISHING FOR. THANK YOU
2,Ink made of gold,"We all know that the printer business model is all about the ink - they sell the printer for a loss and make it up on replacement inks. All well and good, but there is a tolerance level for this pricing model that I feel Canon has crossed over. I think I paid about $100 for the printer to get marginally better photo printing quality vs. my old Epson. But then I discovered that it uses ink like an Eldorado uses gasoline. There are 5 cartridges (2 blacks) - about $17 for just one color, and they need replacement every 3 months. You can do the math. Not only is the cost way beyond reasonable, but it's inconvenient to have to buy ink so frequently. Unless you need a desktop printer exclusively for photo printing, leave this Canon on the shelf."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This printer is driving me up the walls. You can buy and install generic ink, but it won't work as it does not have the chips. I tried everything i can find online regarding resetting the printer. Nothing worked. Finally i took out the generic ones, leaving only the Canon black ink (which is full) and it still won't work. I called tech support, only to find that you need all 5 ink tanks in for it to work, otherwise it will damage the print head. All i want is to print black and white copies!!! THe color ink costs about $45. Almost the same price as the printer when on sale. I'd suggest getting a different printer. Read up on the consumer guide or maybe check out that kodak printer that was on the Apprentice."
1,Don't buy if you only want to print documents,"I got this printer dirt cheap a while ago, but I mostly use it for documents. Despite that fact, it burns through all the colored ink tanks way too fast, and they're very expensive to replace. Search for a cheaper option."
1,Printer Canon IP4200,I received this unit broken. It doesn't print at all even thought I bougth new cartridges and I used them. I wasted my money and my time with this printer.
2,"Cheap printers, expensive ink--buyer beware","Canon makes competent printers at low prices, but be aware that you need to use the expensive Canon brand ink. Canons are notorious for clogging when much less expensive non-Canon replacement inks are used, and Canon has other little tricks such as including chips on the ink cartridges so that a half-full non-Canon replacement cartridge may register as empty. I have years of experience with Canons, including the IP4200; I'm tired of these tricks--it's Epson or HP from now on for me."
2,Horrible Printer,"There is a reason this printer is so cheap. it's unreliable. paper gets stuck and you can pull it out, but the driver still registers it as being stuck, so you have to go through five or six procedures (30 minutes) to fix it. Cartridges are really expensive and they designed the cartridge so you can't get imitation. They have found a way around that, but I will never buy a canon printer. This one was free with my mac, but it has still more hassle than it is worth."
4,Amazing pictures,"This prints great pictures , it absolutely commercial quality pictures. Its easy to install as well. Worth the price of 75 paid for it. I would highly recommend if the primary motive of buying the printer is having quality photos printed at home. The running cost may be slightly higher then the one hour photo labs but its worth the conveneince and quality. The photo printing speed is slow but thats the trade off. CNet has given it 7.5 rating. The only catch is that it has only USB, no network printing."
4,Great Printer,"I've stuck with Canon and PIXMA series printers for the past several years. They are consistently reliable, don't hog ink, are easy to setup, except for one scenario. If you're in a mixed Windows and Mac (OS X) environment, prepare to spend a lot of time configuring the printers/software in order to get it to print exactly right. It took us a few weeks to get the setup exactly the way we wanted it. After that, presto magic!"
1,TERRIBLE general printer,"If you are someone looking for a good all-around printer I would NOT recommend this printer. It prints slowly, and the ink runs out very quickly and is expensive. If you are only printing photographs it might be great, but as a general printer I printed less than 100 pages and the ink cartridge ran out. Also, if there is a problem with the printing, the troubleshooting sucks large amounts of ink out of the cartridges. When I first received this printer I had to call their customer service three times and have them send me replacement parts. They were very pleasant and helpful, but it was frustrating since waiting for the new parts took more than two weeks (where I was without a printer). Also, the troubleshooting that they walked me through took up TWO cartridges of black ink. Again, this review is for those people looking for a fast, economical printer for documents. This is not that printer."
2,Unreliable,Every 2nd or 3rd print this printer tells me I am out of black in ink when I am not. I wonder if this has something to do with the chips on the cartridges? The chips that make replacing ink on this printer more expensive than buying another printer.
1,Constant ink cartridge errors!,"Consumer Reports gave this printer very high ratings but I have never printed anything without getting several ink cartridge error messages. Basicly something is wrong with either the magenta cartridge or the cartridge holder. The indicator light keeps going out on that slot. Removing/reinserting the magenta cart. worked for awhile but now I am unable to use the printer at all because all cart. must be working even to print w/o color. My old Lexmark $50. basic inkjet printer could not do 1/10th of this printers functions - BUT IT ALWAYS WORKED! - I have a tech support backround and have tried everything, including reading the manual & online documentation. There is absolutely no mention of this type of problem. I will be calling Canon - but only to make arrangements to return the printer. What a HUGE wast of time and money!"
4,PROXIMA Printer,"Outstatnding dendability. Printer cartridges are pricy and one must change all of them at once rather than changing just a single one that is low on ink,"
3,Great Results Until It's Time to Replace the Ink,"I'm a Canon fan having had great experience with the Pixma ip4000 and 5000 models. The ip4200 is basically the 4000 model with a few added bells and whistles. However, buyers should note that Canon has manufactured the ip4200 with ink cartridges that carry a coding chip that does not allow after market replacement cartidges to be used. Until after market cartidges catch up, you will have to buy the Canon refills (half the cost of the printer itself) or use the bulk refill kits that are messy and more complicated because of the sealed, pressurized cartridges. If you don't mind paying $40-50 for the refill set, then it's a high performing machine for the price. Otherwise, buy a previous model Canon or wait for the generic cartidges to come onto the market. And for those who question the effectiveness of the generics, I've used dozens of them in Canon and HP printers and plotters at work and home and have not had a single malfunction in five years."
4,good printer but ink cost is $$$$,"I've used Canon inkjets the past few years because of the low cost of compatible cartridges. However, in spite of the fact that this is a wonderful printer, excellent text and photos, this printer will not have the same economic bang. The ink cartridges are proprietary, containing a microchip, and compatibles may not be available at least not for quite a while. This means that cartridges will remain $13 or so apiece (it uses 5 of them) rather than $3-5 each for compatibles. I would take this into consideration before deciding to buy this printer if you go through a lot of ink."
2,Hoot Owl in Misssouri,"Although I have been extremely pleased with past Cannon printers, I have had difficulty with the paper feed of this unit from the beginning of use. The paper consistently does not pass through the printer, in either the cassette or auto feed from above.When the paper feed does work, I am pleased with its performance in both text and photo printing.I have contacted cumtomer service at Canon via e-mail. I was given the option to take the printer to an authorized repair center or to mail it back to Canon for a replacement. I have chosen to replace the unit.So the situation at present is unresolved. I will update this review, reporting the eventual outcome."
1,I HATE this printer,"It's only a year old, I bought new cartridges and I still have no red ink printing. Cartridges are EXPENSIVE. It ""rejected"" one of the black cartridges. It tells me the paper isn't loaded correctly (it is, a MORON could load the paper).DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER"
4,Good quality & price,"Overall a decent printer at a good price. As mentioned in other reviews, I would have liked a printer cable included."
5,I love this printer,"At first I missed my scanner when I bought this printer. However, due to the money I now save on the inexpensive ink cartridges and the quality of the prints, I am a very satisfied customer."
2,Replacing cartridges cost more than the printer,"The printer itself works just fine. My gripe is with the cost to replace the cartridges. You can buy generics, but they don't have the chips to make them work. You have to remove the ones from the original Canon cartridges. Believe me, this is not an easy task. I tried it and was unable to fasten the chip so it would stay on the cartridges. I tried refilling the cartridges myself, but what a mess. If you plan to print photos you should probably stay with Canon cartridges. I have an HP printer that is devoted to photos only so I just need this printer to print out regular stuff."
1,You'll go broke buying ink for this machine,"Sure, it's cheap, but you'll quickly make up for that in buying ink. This printer takes 5 separate ink cartirdges, 4 of which must be bought in a pack, so you end up with extras you never use. It will refuse to print if it thinks any of those 5 cartridges have unacceptable ink levels. This has happened to me even on a fairly new cartridge. Even worse, my particular machine often gets confused and tells me I have more than one of the same color installed (I don't). Again, because of this, it refuses to print. I wish I'd never bought this printer."
4,Canon Pixma ip4200,Excellent print quality. My only criticism is that the carriage is not wide enough to insert an envelope except in landscape mode.
5,canon ip4200 the best value for great looking photo prints,"I am a fine art photographer and I am amazed with what this very affordable printer can do. It is fast and makes amazing prints. The inks last and I have rarely had to clean the heads. Compared to similar Epson models this is faster, less fussy and has more affordable ink cartridges."
4,Satisfied Customer,"Although my use of this product has been very limited so far, I must say that I am more than pleased with it's performance. It seems to be well worth the price that I paid for it and I look forward to printing some of my recent pictures on it very soon."
2,NOT Mac Compatible,"If you want to print from a Mac (or linux PC) over your network, don't get this printer. This printer only works as a network printer if all of your computers are running windows. If you have only one Mac and it's a desktop system or you don't mind having to plug your laptop into the printer, this printer will work for you.The Windows drivers work great - there is no difference between printing to this printer from a networked Windows PC and the Windows PC that the printer is plugged into."
4,My third Pixma in the family.,"I had a Pixma 4000 and loved it, so I got my oldest daughter a Pixma 4000 and she loves it. Then I got my youngest daughter a Pixma 4200 and she loves it. The only drawback for me is that the ink cartridges are not the same for the two models. Probably not a problem for most people."
3,"Ok, but there are better versions from other companies","These karaoke songs are ok, some are good, none are great. I prefer other brands which are much closer to sounding original,, but people looking for lower cost karaoke that aren't overly concerned about quality may like these."
5,Great Inspiration,A great book to pick up inspiration and ideas or just to spend some quality time with. Well worth it.
4,Rocky Mountian Wildflower - Pocket Guide,This is a great book for identifying flowers along the trails. It fits easily into a jacket pocket and its color divisions makes it easy to quickly identify flowers. While on the trials I was able to identify two dozen or so flowers. It is a very complete guide to flowers of the Rocky Mountians.The only problem I found with this book is that it is not rain proof. If it gets wet it turns to mush. Once it dies out the pages stick together so well that there is no way to salvage it. So it would be a good idea to pack in a plastic bag to store this book in should you encounter an afternoon rain storm while hiking.
2,Great but...,"The issue I have with this toy is not that it doesn't work. It ABSOLUTELY does. However, the material it's made if is absolutely disgusting. It smells and tastes like latex powder. And no matter how many times you wash, sterilize and scrub it, the taste and smell rubs off everywhere. So if you are planning to use this toy to add some excitement in bed, beware that you and your partner will both taste the nasty residue that this toy leaves behind. PLEASE make this same toy, but out of something else, and I will be the first to buy."
2,Great while it worked,"Sue Johanson Royal Surfer Clitoral StimulatorI received this product about 4 months ago. I greatly enjoyed the product, but after about a dozen uses, the vibration stopped working. The rotation feature still works, but that is not enough for me. I have contacted Amazon to see if they will replace it. If not, I will not buy another product like this from Amazon. If it only works for 4 months, it is definitely not worth the money."
4,gets the job done,"never had purchased any sue johanson products however her show is quite interesting so on a whim i figured i would give her endorsed items a try. the product certainly has clitoral simulation covered. that alone will make you see blue. as for the barrel, the stimulation there is not so great. must be on high to get any real excitement going with the barrel. have had ""the rabbit"" before and while both are similar this is a close second. would put money towards the rabbit over this as the barrel design let me down. not enough bang for the buck. royal surfer is a good deal for the money as a starter toy but not quite 5 stars."
5,Perfect for a quick tension release,"After purchasing many a poorly designed product, I decided to get the Royal Surfer. It definitely does what it is designed to do and got me there MUCH quicker than just about any other. I'm not sure about durability, as I've only had it a few weeks, but so far I am extremely satisfied with the purchase. Highly recommended!"
4,I would buy it again,I ordered this about a year ago and the button for the rotation is hard to press now but overall it still works and feels great! It's great too if you only have a few minutes to get the job done!
1,doesn't work,2nd one first one lasted 5 months this one 1 minute. when it worked it was great. this one is junk
2,This just bored me to no end.,"I am a student of philosophy and rhetoric and have spent many hours of my life buried in complicated and dense reading. But this book just takes the cake!It is not complicated. It is not dense. It is just boring.The idea is interesting, but Hanley spends too much time on basic philosophy and too little on the relationship of Star Trek and its philosophy. However I am sure a few undergraduates would be comfortably induced into an introductory class with this title.If you really want to read the book, read it out loud as though it were being presented as a series of lectures. It is much easier to follow."
3,Interesting,"I decided to read this book after finishing Lawrence Krauss' The Physics of Star Trek and was surprised to learn that there's a whole lot more controversial stuff going on in Star Trek than just the technological aspects. Krauss' brings up some interesting philosophical viewpoints. I was hoping he would give a little more of his opinion in the book, he stayed mostly neutral throughout his arguments, but I guess that lets us draw our own conclusions. The book gets a little slow and difficult to read a times but I think it is worth reading if you're a Star Trek fan and ever thought about the possibility of an artificial intelligence like Data."
3,Interesting in parts...,"If you're interested in Star Trek _and_ philosophy then this is the book for you! However if you like Star Trek but aren't too fussed about philosophy then you might want to give this one a miss.I found the first half of this book, discussing what constitutes intelligence and what is ""a person"", fairly boring. Things picked up a bit when the author moved on to transporters and time travel, but I've got to question some of the authors technical knowledge. He may know lots about philosophy but his physics is a bit shaky at times.Of course philosophy being such a ""hairy-fairy"" science (some people don't even class it as a ""real"" science) it's very hard to argue with the authors conclusions. It's not like you can _prove_ anything, is it?A much better read are Lawrence Krauss' books ""The Physics of Star Trek"" and ""Beyond Star Trek""."
1,Don't waste your money on this garbage,"Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but after studying Philosophy for 2 years, this book was an insult. It didn't offer me any new insights into star trek, or the philosophy behind it. Instead, it made me realize that anybody can make a buck, despite the poor quality of their work, if they take the opportunities before them and act on them quick enough, and thats what this guy did.He must have read ""The Physics of Star Trek"", realized the oppotunity before him, and jumped at it, at the expense of myself and others."
1,I want to Burn This book,"This book is horrible. If I didn't have to read this book for class, I would burn it right now. It is arguing fiction with nonfiction. I think we all know machines aren't human! Don't waste your money unless you idolize Star Trek."
5,Good Side-Scrolling Fun,"Old School 2D! Fun as all get out, but be warned it is a true button-masher! You'll need some cool-down time for those over-heated thumbs after about 20 minutes of this wild ride.True in almost every aspect to the original; it's a nice trip down memory lane. (for those of you who actually remember the neighborhood arcade.)Good graphics and very satisfying gunplay. Explosions are good too.A worthy purchase for the ""old school"" arcade aficianado!"
3,arcade is better,this game is cool and all i though it would be really fun and it was but i still say the arcade version is better
3,"Never received, but was very responsive and fixed issue","Waited until the final date that it could appear and it never showed up. Contacted them and within three days, I was able to get a refund! Thanks!"
5,Egyptian Magic Cavalcade,"You ever wonder what the ankh meant? Or how about the scarab? This is the book you need. Everything from amulets, to talismans are destribe within the pages of this collection. From practical uses , to the magical power they had within, descriptions of ceremonies and all are here. Take this book home in your shopping cart, all you lovers of Egyptian culture"
2,"you guys sound like that band ""winger"" my opinion""you suck"".","I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD GIVE UP. SORRY IF I HURT YOUR FILLING BUT ITS ALL THE TRUTH YOU GUYS ""SUCK""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. YOU GUYS WILL BE KNOWN AS THAT BAND THAT SONDS LIKE WINGER AND THAT PRETTY MUCH SUX SO AS I SAID IF I WERE YOU GUYS I WOULD HAVE GAVE UP AGES AGO!!!!! I SAY YOU GET ON WITH IT ""GOOD LUCK"" YOU'LL NEED IT!!!"
2,DOA,"I was excited to get this item, as I used to travel 400 miles every other weekend. I drive a MT car, and would have loved to be able to use this during my long commute, but when it arrived, it would not charge. :-( I contacted the seller for an exchange, and they wanted me to pay to return the defective item. After kindly pointing out that I had already paid for the item as listed, and to have it shipped, and that it would make no sense to have me pay to return the item to them, I received no further communication from the seller, but did receive an email from Amazon informing me that I had received a full refund for my item, so in the end, I never received a working unit, but I received a full refund for the defective item."
1,57% of my order was successful,"My order was for 7 of Xcite BLUE2GO, 4 of them work good, but I have problems with 3 units (57% of my order was successful).For the 4 units that work, when I connect the charger the red light turns blue after a few hours and then works fine.When I connect the charger to the 3 non-functional units the light is constant red. I have waited for 48 hours without results. I consider that the battery is not charging. Return these units to the store is more expensive (money and time) than buying new ones (obvious another brand)."
1,Realy bad product,"This device never worked the way I expected, very difficult to pair with your phone, it disconnects all the time v12 car charger, steering wheel remote control does not have enough strength to reach when you're driving."
1,dont work..,i think they should stop selling this product here. i recevied this item and plugged it in to my 12v car charger. and nothing happened. it doesnt work. poor quality. i didnt even returned it b/c its waste of my time going to post office. i just trashed in garbage.. Dont buy it!!!
1,Won't buy another one,"I'm not sure I would buy another product with the Xcite name on it. I bought 2 of these. One for each car. I figured at the price I don't have much to loose. Well the first one wouldn't charge the headset making it junk. I'm a bit of a techy and was never able to figure out how to make the car unit work and the volume on the headset of the second one was far from loud enough. The positive side is that when I tried to return the defective unit, I was told by the shipper that it's not worth the shipping to return defective units and to throw it away. They then credited my account for full purchase price. I would not recommend this product. However, the shipper was fantastic."
1,The Cure for Insomnia,"This has got to be one of the worst books I have had the unpleasure of having to read. I am a Junior in a Catholic High School which makes the the age they are trying to target and I can tell you it simply does NOT WORK! If you like a bad plot, bad writing, and bad characters, this book is for you.Just to give you a sample from this book I provide you with these two quotes:""And her pale face turned nearly white.""""'I want to be with Dawna and you when you celebrate the sacrament, George. And I think we should ask the students who were in the Grief Support Group to come. That would mean a lot to Dawna. It will be a very powerful moment, I think. Like Tennyson wrote, `More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.''""Father George kidded for a moment, `Do you think maybe you could get Tennyson to say a few words at my funeral?' Veronica smiled knowingly. She loved George's gentle wit, which was often at his best when he was deeply concerned about something."""
1,"Sad, very sad.","I, like the others, bought this DVD thinking it was a legit CD (I've seen the word unathorized used on videos before and thought it was just part of the name) with interviews, backstage material, and good music...instead I get a very disappointing knock-off. When I got home and took the wrapper and stickers off of the package it had in very small print on the back that the people making these DVDs got no permission from Nickelback or the producers (which means the band makes no profit) Why is this even being sold? I thought that kind of stuff was illegal."
1,not what i expected,this was a very poorly made documentary. there was barely anything about the band and they kept flashing the same still shots of them over and over again. the dvd was poor quality and it seemed like it was just pasted together in a rush. it seemed like it was skipping even though there are no scratches so it is just poor quality. i wouldn't recommend this.
1,For Sale: $1.00 plus shipping,"Alright, so maybe a dollar is a little steep for this, so just send shipping costs and you can have it.I couldn't even watch it all. It's unauthorized because no director, producer or Nickelback themselves would authorize its' release. No music,terrible documentary and not worth .10 cents. This is the worst DVD in my collection, but, I only own 674 of them ! This is only my opinion though, buy mine and decide yourself!"
1,"i haven't seen this one, yet....","i just wanted to clear something up~! the nickelback UNAUTHORIZED ""this side up"" is NOT the dvd that they have been talking about recently! nickelback has nothing to do with this dvd! the new dvd (that will be awesome) is coming out sometime in October...check the official nickelback site for further details. I'm just a huge nickelback fan that doesn't want to see ppl get upset with the band when its not even nickelback's production project....thanks..."
1,Total zero,"If I could have rated this a zero or minus zero, I would have.Maybe they were just looking for a reason to make this dvd, but I wouldn't advise anyone to waste their money, time or effort on this. Do yourself a favor, buy Live At Home from Nickelback or any of their cds, THAT would be worth the time and money!!!!"
1,Could this DVD SUCK MORE? I think Not!,"My God!!! Look people you are never going to find a bigger Nickelback Fan than me, But this DVD SUCKS! I was hoping to see some concert footage, but all I got were some unknown people talking about Canada and how low in Music Resources they are. ..."
1,By Far The Worst Music DVD I've Seen Yet!!!!,"I bought this on sale for $7 and thought I would give it a try. Within the first 30 seconds I knew I made a mistake. This is the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen! I didn't even finish it and plan on throwing this DVD in the trash because I'm embarrassed to have it in my collection.This DVD is a complete waist of time and money! Do NOT buy this! Don't even waist your time watching it! Don't even watch it to see what all the fuss is about if you're wondering ""Just how bad could this really be?"" Trust me and all the other reviewers, your better off doing something else with your time."
1,could have been better,"in the full concert they open together, both sing seperate and then close together. this edited version cuts out all of elton johns solo songs. i was very disapointed."
2,Poor Quality Picture and Muffled Sound,"Do not consider this item! The sound is very poor...muffled. Additionally, poor picture quality. I am disappointed in this product. Would LOVE to return it for my money back!"
3,"Great artists, poor delivery","The DVD arrived in a mailing bag and not a mailing box (though it did have a dvd box) so it was not protected very well. The dvd had fallen out of the thing it snaps into and was sliding around in the dvd box and had some scratches, although this did not affect the dvd performance. It's weird that the photos on the cover seem much more recent than the concert. It was obvious that parts had been cut out, and I would have liked to have the longer version. Also, Elton John sang only a few songs-I seem to remember now that I had heard that he had laryngitis or some other throat problem when this concert was touring. Billy Joel was fantastic as usual and he does wonderfully singing Elton's songs. Overall good buy for the money."
1,Elton John and Billy Joel,This dvd is very poor quality. We turned it off after 20 minutes.What can I do with this product?
2,Only Part of the Story,"Ms Gross (not a medical doctor or qualified in any medical field) is a supporter of yoga, meditation and breathing exercises. These modalities are quite useful in controlling the anxiety typically found in chronic nonbacterial prostatitis patients, but one needs to go further and look at trigger point release and mast cell degranulation inhibition to really get to grips with this disorder. Pelvic Myoneuropathy (as the condition is sometimes called nowadays) is a result of a subtle interplay of nerves, muscles and mind. More than meditation and deep breathing is required to combat this nasty condition, as evinced by the many success stories emerging on the Internet recently from men treated appropriately. Note: this comment only pertains to our state of knowledge as of early 2005."
1,Intended for the ignorant,"I picked this book up because I greatly respect (if not entirely agree with) the philosophies of Ayn Rand and enjoyed Branden's revision of 'My Years With Ayn Rand'. I was expecting another fresh look at the self, something detailed, something useful. I was sorely disapointed.Anyone who has had any exposure to Rand's Objectivist philosophies or ever thought for themselves at all will find this book incredibly dull. Thankfully, it's written in short bursts of a pharagraph or two at a time, seperated by various repetitive headers, unfortunately, the content of each paragraph burst is just as repetitive as the headers.Meant for the ignorant, if you have any sense of self-worth whatsoever, this book will be of no use to you - there's nothing new there."
5,Travel the blues mosaic,"This is a fantastic primary history source for music afficianados who view music as a cross-generational tapestry, in addition to individual songs.Dan Aykroyd and Ben Manilla organize this book into three groupings: Blues Legends who synthesized the gengre we now call the blues, Rock Royalty whose music has been inspired by it, and Keepers of the Flame who continue playing the blues closer to it's original style. The authors take a wide view of the blues, and present a tapestry of interviews that show precisely how deep the influence is. Connecting Muddy Waters to ZZ Top is not a huge stretch, but viewing Aerosmith as a 3rd generation recipient of the blues is more interesting.One strength of the book is that Dan Aykroyd was able to capture many greats such as John Lee Hooker and Bo Diddley before they passed. Perhaps that adds another hint of blue to the book - it would have been great to read similar interiews of more legends now passed."
4,Works great!,"These work great and last a long time! They are like the ones that nail salons use. I find that the work better than the pumice stones that you typically find in stores. They aren't too rough on the feet, but still gets rid of all that dead, dry skin!"
4,good value,"I originally found these at a regional faire. They are great, especially now that I know where to find them."
3,Not what I expected,"When I purchased this set of pumice sponges, I obviously wrongfully assumed that they varied in coarseness and had some flexibility(for getting between toes particularly). Wrong! Use on skin other than calluses or feet not recommended!"
5,Great Value,"I have purchased pumice sponges from the local beauty supply, but these are definitley the better value because they do not wear away as soon as you use them."
5,Pumice sponge block,"Love these.. I use them every day when I shower. Just like the ones from salon, but more substantial. I've had others that fall apart pretty quickly. These are sturdy."
1,"Young Patriots, Boring Book","I have read this book. Shallow details, and not written in a style that does this fascinating part of our history any justice. A lot of open holes, skipping from one thought to another, and parts simply boring. Don't waste your money or valuable time."
3,Decent documentary,This movie gives a decent introduction to the Zapatista movement for those who do not know much about it. The interviews are interesting but I was not very involved emotionally with it.
3,Magnificent Obession,"This was a charming love story intertwined with a coming of age story. The words and writing style give evidence to the age of the book without taking away readability. I was expecting more details of the super personality, which were presented strangely, as if the reader already knew about and understood what it was; as if the author had described it previously. In that regard it was disappointing, but overall a likable story."
5,A truely magnificent message convey in a secular dimension,"The power behind the message convey by this book is stupendiuos,but one is bound to be disappointed if motivated by greed and selfishness. Douglas has manage to pressent the teaching of Christ in a meaningful secular manner."
2,Magnificent Obsession,This book is written in old english format.. I had a hard time keeping track of the story line... maybe I need to return to school and study lit... again
2,Watch out for this!,"This is a nice love story. I enjoyed it for that aspect. However the ""magnificant obsession"" turns a Christian concept into a new age philosophy. Don't be fooled. This is definetly an anti-Christian book. The concept is that in order to gain power in ones personality one must do good deeds towards fellow man and demand that the recipient tell no one about the ""gift."" That's fine. However, the book refers to a Higher Personality rather than God, and Jesus as ""The Galilean"" represented as some some of genius, not God incarnate. There are many other aspects that closely resemble the occult. This suprised me frankly as I loved the movie. If you are well grounded spiritually and wish to overlook these aspects, enjoy the book. But be careful not to buy into the philosophy/religion that is suggested by the author. Strange writing coming from the author of ""the Robe."" (However, I haven't read that yet)."
2,Less than magnificient.,"I found Magnificent Obsession a disappointment. Another book by the same author, The Robe, gets my highest rating. Perhaps I expected more from MO because of that. Frankly, I was not drawn into this book and found it boring.A short story in Eleanor Farjeon's book, ""The Little Bookroom,"" portrayed a similar them to the one in MO but it was far more compelling and touching. It was about the change in a man's character as he he felt a compulsion to be kind."
2,Don't waste your time on this one.,"Based on others' reviews, my expectation was that this book would fan the flame of my desire for Jesus. Turns out it's not terribly biblical. It borrows a few isolated ideas from Jesus's teachings, but it doesn't promote the gospel. It purports to discuss a life-changing, amazing philosophy, but the philosophy pales in comparison to the truth. Sure, it's nice and all to philanthropize without getting recognition for it, but that's _not_ what fulfills you in the long run. _MO_ discusses this concept of the Major Personality (who is supposed to be God), but doesn't acknowledge it as God, and doesn't recognize that Jesus is God in the flesh. Even the reverend who plays a part in Bobby Merrick's life toward the end of the novel fails to acknowledge the truth of the Bible. The story line is mildly interesting, but for me, that didn't redeem the whole reading of the book."
3,3.5 stars for BMRs' grunge record,"I must be the only who thinks that Bad Moon Rising went full-blown grunge with this release. Don't get me wrong now, I love this band and everything, but ""Opium For The Masses"" is a grunge album. That being said, it isn't a bad alternative record or anything, it just isn't very melodic sounding.""Opium For The Masses"" marked the first Bad Moon Risng album to be released for an audience outside of Japan. While I can't understand why this album was the one to get the international attention, I think that should have been their debut, it's still a pretty solid hard rock album. My favorite tracks from the album are ""Beligerent Stance"", ""Rivers Run Red"", ""Monkey"", ""Free"", and ""Believe"".Overall, this is not Bad Moon Rising's finest album. It's not a bad album at all, but I would recommend their debut, or even ""Blood"" before you get ""Opium For The Masses""."
4,Bad Moon Rising,"Bad Moon Rising deserve to be more famous than they are: it is a very good alternative hard rock band which produces a quite particular sound (close to Therapy).To summarize, Bad Moon Rising is a nice small band without pretentions..."
3,Good story but depressing!,This second game is not quite as good as the first. The first I felt was more interesting this story was too depressing even though you save everyone from the main monster your characters end up not happily ever after. I also would like to know what exactly The Secret of Merlin was? The whole game did not even talk about it. All this story talked about was a curse that you had to find out why it was put on and who put it on. Another thing that bothered me about this game was that you visited alot of the same places that you did from the first game and there were only maybe 2 or 3 new places to visit but it felt like you were playing the first game again. I liked it but it was not as good as the first one but I am willing to give it 3 stars for good story even though depressing.
4,Works Great,"The Rear Seat Protector works great.The only drawback with it is I have not figured out how to connect the safety harness to my dog.My dog is a sheltie. She lays down on the protector, but it would be nice to be able to attach her to her safety belt.I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,sloppy and cheesy lounge music,This is one of the worst CD's I have ever paid for. This artist (?) plagarizes other musicians works and the musicianship is poor. Makes a great drink coaster for your coffee table.
4,Great As Always !,"Brian Setzer's music is always great. The songs are good, and the music brings the words to life. It may cost a little more, but this is a great import, you'll love it."
4,Brian Setzer Orchestra Guitar Slinger,"Setzer brought back his version of the 50's sound with the Stray Cat's and he refined it with class in the Brian Setzer Orchestra, he is the king of this sound today(few bands dared go down this road and no band does it better). Brian Setzer easily makes any serious top 100 guitarists of all time list. This album is too cool, it's a keeper and I give it a four out of five. The song, 'Rumble in Brighton' off of this album deserves a ten."
1,FULL BODY SCREEN Protector for Nano,"Advertising is misleading. It says it is ""FULL BODY"", but in reality it only covers the wheel and screen in the front, the back is the only fully covered. It is really NOT the ""FULL BODY"". The only good thing is the it arrived fast. Not happy at all w/the product. Different from what the picture and description said."
4,For Tangueros -- it is delightfully new and different,"I tend to be a traditionalist in my choice of music. However, if you know me, you recognize that I like variety. Recently, I came off a cycle of listening to Juan D'Arienzo, Carlos DiSarli, Francisco Canaro, and Orquesta Tipica Victor. It was time for a change, yet I was not ready to listen to ""La Revancha del Tango."" I needed something a little different, yet something that is suitable for dancing.My choice of Donato Raciatti was in response to a recommendation of Joseph Bain of Montreal in the Tango DJ's Forum. Raciatti was right on the money. An excellent purchase for me. I had gotten value for my money. You will find it similar to D'Arienzo and Biaggi -- and I think you will like it as much as I do. This is especially recommended for the milonguero style."
5,Phenominal Scholarly Overview,"I really enjoyed how this book looked very practically at the arts and the evolution of them within the church. It gives not only a historical requirement to continue to press for more artistic use and involvement in the modern movement of the church, but also gives practical ways in which to do so. If you're involved in creative arts ministry in any capacity, you probably should read this book in order to get your berings."
5,Inspiring Music,"Original soundtrack the IMAX motion picture which, once I saw it, immediately prompted me to buy the CD. The score by Steve Wood and Daniel May plus arrangements of the music of George Harrison, gives the film just the right emotional backdrop. From exotic Asian instrumentals and the chants of Buddhist monks to uplifting segments by the full orchestra, this CD never fails to takes my breath away. I listen to it every day on my way to work!"
4,Soaring music with one notable crevasse,"I saw this film when it came out and excitedly bought the soundtrack at the nearby gift shop. The music is great, but the real selling point for me was the final rendition of 'Here Comes the Sun' in the movie. Alas, this version - with new vocals by George Harrison - was not included on the soundtrack. How disappointing!If you haven't seen the film you won't miss it, but if you have it's kind of obvious. You'll have to see the DVD to hear it."
3,Good Information,"It has good information, if you've never done any research on this subject. I had and, therefore, did not learn anything new. I passed it along to a friend that had just been diagnosed with hypertension and she found it useful. Never a waste of money if you can help a friend..."
4,Motivating Format,This book has a motivating format for controlling high blood pressure and maintaining weight. The DASH diet information is wonderful---the food is delicious and healthful. I can honestly see myself eating this way the rest of my life. The information on stress relief and exercise is also very well-written.
3,not enough information,"I found this book to be a summary of all the collective knowledge I have previously obtained on the subject of high blood pressure. I purchased the book looking forward to following their suggested eating plan, however, the receipes do not contain any information with respect to number of servings, calories, sodium content, fat content, etc. You never quite know if that Spinach Pie you just wolfed down was meant to be shared amongst 2 or 6 people. Because of this, I had to give up as I just don't have the time to calculate appropriate servings size, etc."
2,not helpful,"nothing new, rehash of old material. waste of time. if there is a positive, you may get some use of this book with the reciepies."
5,This is a great book,I dearly love this book. It was just as it was advertised. It arrived just as the sender said it would.
4,i wanted to give it 5!,"this spins constantly in my CD player - it has even replaced my own band's CD. I heard ""Easy Listening Blues"" on South Carolina Public Radio one night and had to get this CD.I'd never heard of Harris prior to then. This won't be my last purchase of his music. I love his piano playing, his vocals sound a bit too Harry Connick-ish though"
5,Refreshing and simply mellow,Loston Harris brings a refreshing approach to modern day jazz. His playing is superior and his vocals are smooth and non-intrusive to the arrangment. This is a young musican who is on his way to the top in a class by himself. This project is a welcome addition.
1,Dannion Brinkley exposed,Dannion Brinkley is a total fraud. Dannion Brinkley exposed [...]. He has manufactured and exaggerated a fiction of his lightning strike account for personal profit. His wife revived him a few minutes after he was struck by lightning.
2,"Good, but not great","I recently read this book after being referred to it by a friend. It was very interesting,covering the details of his near death experience and those of others he met through his lifetime but i found myself solely looking forward to reading the personal near death experiences of people he met rather than the details of the mission that he was sent back to undertake. An interesting read, but in my belief it certainly was not a life changing experience for myself. I also found that I could not stand the way he continually revealed to everyone he met about his experiences. Enlightening, but not overly uplifting."
3,I guess I was expecting more,"After the Light is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great NDE, but the rest of it shows how anyone can open up, if they learn how. I'm not saying After the Light is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more."
1,Proven to be wrong again and again,"Dannion Brinkley offers a lot prophecies given to him during his NDE. NONE (zero, nada, zilch) have proven right. What more do you need to feel betrayed? I read this book years ago, and truly awaited some of the scary events the author predicts. I was a believer then - and I am a disbliever now. And if his prophecies turn out to be complete nonsense (as they did), why believe even a word of the rest of the book?"
3,Interesting but not convincing,"Who am I to doubt Dannion. I cannot judge whether Dannion is right or wrong, but he is entitled to his belief, just as we all are. But some things didn't ring true and I had a hard time following the story. I really wasn't convinced. It sounded too much like ""New Age"" to me. However, I do believe that we will all meet God and have to answer for how we lived our life here on earth. I also believe that we each will have our own experience of passing from life to death. God controls how we will experience that passing and He knows each of us intimately even when we don't acknowledge him. I believe that God sent His Son to die on the cross for me and since I accept Jesus as my Saviour, then I have faith that I will meet His Son once I die. God bless you Dannion for writing this book to make each of us think about our mortality and how we will answer God once we meet Him."
2,Disappointing.,"The book was at first interesting, but than scared the crap out of me. I had to finish it only in hopes that the ending would calm me. It did a little only because it didn't continue to scare me. All his predictions we're revealed as I feel they should have been."
5,Find the audio versions for Dannion's excellent humor.,"After reading this book and At ""Peace in the Light"" I was lucky enough to buy a copy of both books on audio. Dannion reads both with an experience enhancing insight for the ""reader"", his awe at his ""adventures"" and frequent ironic sarcasms aimed at the extraordinary situations he was placed in come through to make the story VERY real for us. Keep off of the phone Dannion, we need you around for a while..."
5,Very thought-provoking,"I don't know if Brinkley's story is true, but his description of his after-life experience really rang true for me. If there is an afterlife, I think it's as he describes - reliving your life, experiencing for yourself all the joy and pain you brought to others."
1,Pure made up nonsense,I have read several books about NDE. I pretty much believed on all of them EXCEPT this one (Saved by the Light: The True Story of a Man Who Died Twice and the Profound Revelations He Received) by Dannion Brinkely.The entire book is a joke. His supposed revelations are pure nonsense. What a joke! I really like the NDE subject. I do believe that life continues after physical death (on the other side) but it is not the nonsense that Brinkely came up with in his book. I wish I had not read this book because it totally spoiled the subject that I really like it.
5,incredible story,"What if the meanest and most hatefull bully from high school had a terrible accident and suffered horribly for many years in the flesh to pay for his bad actions? What if, with that, he gained incredible knowledge from heaven, great spiritual gifts, had a second chance and became one the kindest persons you know?That's the story you will find in the book. There are also some interesting prophecies he makes in the book based on the information he supposedly gained in the other side, but quite frankly that was of a lesser interest to me."
5,purchased for a friend,I purchased this for a friend that lost a 28 yr old son to a heart problem.I wanted to read it to make sure that it wouldn't upset her.I really got a lot out of it. I have always loved the number 13 and was looked at funny at when I voiced that.There are 13 souls that he was with when he died so that was interesting to me.Someone that was making it up would not choose 13.I know this is how it is.My friend will read this next.
4,Enlightening,I've always been fascinated by NDE stories. I liked this book because there were some things that he explained that I have rarely seen in other NDE stories. Worth a read if you are interested in this type of thing.
1,Don't accept anything at face value,"I have not read this book. I understand, however, that the author claims to have been a Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam sent to assassinate enemy leaders. This claim is exposed in the book Stolen Valor by Burkett and Whitely as unsupported by military personnel records. According to Burkett, Brinkley's records show that he was a USMC truck driver who never left the states and contain no evidence that he received any of the training that would have resulted in an assignment as a sniper or in covert operations."
3,I agree with Interesting but not Convincing,I recently read and reviewed a book on here that was about returning from the dead so to speak. I was surprised at how it grabbed me and held me and I believed every word of it. In this book it wasnt close to the same. I am in no position to know if all that is said and described in the book happened. I can say that as I read of it some of the experiences of the person prior to his life altering experience were suspect to me. It describes the experience in great detail and goes on for sometime but in the end it wasnt convincing to me and I am just one person who reads a lot. It was an okay read.
1,I Don't Buy It,"The impression I get from this book is that Brinkley is trying to cash in on the popularity of Betty Eadie's wonderful book, ""Embraced by the Light."" But I don't believe this guy. What lost me was his claim that the angels told him to open a chain of health spas. Uh huh.Update 1/4/11: It seems Paul Perry, Dannion Brinkley's co-author, is listed here as the author, but Brinkley gets the credit in another listing on Amazon where this book can be found. I would not buy a used car from this man."
5,Life Changing Read!!!,"Wonderful book! Dannion Brinkley takes you on the journey of his life and death to help you fill your own life with powerful wisdom and meaning! Just the first of three Dannion Brinkely, life changing books. Dannion and his wife Kathryn both fill peoples lives with love and joy through their books and programs."
5,nice dressers,"""my 2 dressers were delivered and assembled before they were even scheduled to arrive! they are sturdy & very attractive and have already recieved compliments. they had only a few minor nicks that are barely noticeable. they were not difficult to assemble as I had my high school age son do so and this was his first time assembling any furniture i put them side by side with a tv in the middle and two small 3-shelf bookcases on top and they look like a more expensive entertainment system. I'm very pleased & plan to purchase a 3rd one as well. THANKS visionDecor!""tycollins"
4,Great for Baby,"My husband and I needed a small dresser for baby clothes. We wanted something with multiple drawers so that we could keep sizes together (one drawer for 0-3 month, one drawer for 3-6 month, etc.). This Prepac White 4-Drawer Chest was fairly easy to put together and cheap to buy. It's even small enough that we could put it inside the closet if we need more room in the actual nursery for something else.The chest is light weight enough to move around, but it's heavy enough that I'm confident that it won't topple over. It also comes with a mounting brace so that you don't have to worry about an older kid pulling it down on himself. The drawers open easily, and the knobs are not cheap feeling.This is a simple, affordable dresser, especially for a kid's room."
3,"Good price, okay quality","Great price! I was a little disappointed that the tracks are not smooth at all- there is no rolling wheel so it is kind of cheap in that aspect- however, I have a 16 month old and because the drawers do not pull out so smoothly she is not able to pull the drawers out and empty them! So THAT is a plus!"
2,Body and the Book Writing from a Mennonite Life,"Another book written to cash in on the believing ancestors of the author. Good for the rubber- neckers who want to read the stories of her childhood, even better for those who have no reference point to Mennonite life. I think the only honest things the author said were, one, her family is not impressed with her using them for the enterprise and two, that she is an Episcopalian and not Mennonite. I think the title is meant to capture a larger Mennonite audience that will be sorely disappointed in the work. I gave up reading it around the third chapter, as the book rambles too much and doesn't appear to have much of a point to it. I didn't want to give up reading The Body, I feel that anyone who I review deserves to have the entire book read, but I also inter-library loaned ""What Are Mennonites Thinking About? 1998"" and that fully captured my attention."
3,get back with enuff znuff,this album has some good tunes on it.the production sounds kinda weak.it's a very expensive album. so only for the hardcores.
4,Amazing pop from Enuff Z'nuff amazing singer,Donnie Vie's Just Enough is an amazing disc. Right from Spider Web through Wastin' Time not a bad tune in the bunch. Better Days and That's What Love Is are the standout tracks. A must have for any Enuff Z'nuff fans. Anyone who is a fan of Beatlesque hooks should check it out. It would be a five star rating except you can tell it is a low budget record. With better production this is a five star record. Highly recommend this album.
1,Mismatched excerpts,"I called up A Time To Remember: Original Chart Hits [1950 Original Chart Hits] and when I called up ""Home Cooking"" and ""June Is Busting Out All Over"" for samples I got Hank Williams Sr. doing a couple of his big hits. Somebody goofed."
1,This Guy is a Crook - Buyer Beware !,"I purchased from Indigoheirlooms ""365 cryptogram"" paper back book for a gift. I thought I was receiving something special as the price was $59.10. When the puzzle book arrived it was nothing more than a small paperpack with the manufacturer's price of $6.95. (I've since found it elsewhere for $10.00 which included shipping) Then I thought how could he charge me over $50.00 more for a $6.95 paperback? I was extremely angry and appaled and proceeded to contact this seller and his reply was ""ok ship it back at your expense and I charge a 20% restock fee"". This guy is a real jerk and a horrible business person. There are other reviews listed here of other people he has duped. DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS CROOK ! ! ! ! And, oh did I say he's nasty too."
5,Hold On For A Wild Ride,"Thoroughly enjoyed Gilstrap's two previous books, Nathan's Run and At All Costs, and expected to be pleased with Even Steven. But when I caught my breath after the crazy 24-hour ride that is this book - WOW, I realized this is his best yet- and a wild ride it is. The action is real, so when it gets to the big screen, there won't be much work to do on the screenplay! The characters really ring true, and I wanted to stay with them. The author is truly a master of character and suspense, and so very good at describing the range of emotion that comes with having children in our lives. Bravo Mr. Gilstrap!"
2,Enough Already!,"The idea behind this book is a good one, and if it had been properly handled it would have carried it off. Unfortunately, it wasn't properly handled. There was so much going on with this book it was hard to keep the bad guys straight. Why would two normal people keep a found child that doens't belong to them, and from where did the ""madness"" come that made Susan think it was her lost baby? Why did Bobby go along with it? There are more quetions left unanwered than what was answered. For example, Samuel apparently goes through a metamorphisis where he becomes angry and wants to kill the people that killed his brother, and then he totally forgets this and lets them go while he goes after the child. Then he feels protection for the child and gets hurt because of it. I could go on, but that would give the whole book away so will stop. I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Not his best work,"Being a fan of the Jonathan Grave series, I was wondering what to expect from this novel. Sadly I was very disappointed. The characters were rather one-dimensional and I really didn't buy the plot. Large parts of the descriptions were rather boring to me, and I kept thinking: Get to the point!"
4,Some Problems... All in All a Good Read,"Gilstrap has once again amazed me with his powerful ""family on the run""-type writing style. ""Even Steven"" is, overall, a good book. It doesn't quite live up to ""At All Costs,"" and is no where near as compelling as ""Nathan's Run,"" but not all books can be classics. Gilstraps offers situations that everyone can relate to. A mother in fear of losing a child, a father trying to keep control over his family, an older brother stuck caring for his younger sibling, and a younger brother unable to shed the annoyance of having his older brother watching his every move. Gilstrap's main lacking point is the way he caries out his plot. Sometimes it seems as though he were looking for the easy way out, and didn't take the time to make the stroy beleivable. I would consider this a bedside book. Don't be surprised if it doesn't turn out to be an instant classic!"
2,lots of action but little else,"If you like melodrama - lots of action, a few decent characters, but others totally unrealistic, then you'll like this book. I enjoy a well-placed 4-letter word as much as most readers, but Gilstrap goes overboard here, even with the characters most likely not to be shouting invectives at each other and in descriptive narrative of the weather. Though fast moving, it's also repetitive. This is my first Gilstrap, so if he's still getting ""better and better"", I think I'll wait a few more books."
1,Nice try but just plain bad,"This is yet another bad ghetto blaxploitation film from the folks at York Entertainment, whose motto seems to be: if it's negative, drug-infested stereotypes about African Americans in the hood, we'll sell it. And here we go again...The sound on this DVD is so bad, its hard to understand anyone. The images ae so dark, it's hard to see anyone. After 30 minutes, I turned it off because it was too hard to watch.To buy this film is only to encourage them to make more of this ghetto/hood nonsense. Just say no and hopefully they will go away."
2,Fascinating subject - poorly executed,"The book describes a fascinating subject and delivers a lot of useful historical information. So, for those interested in the topic it provides specific data. As the work of literature, though, it falls short of a good read. It feels that the author would do much better writing this story as a non-fiction. Her factual passages are closer to the expected stile of non-fiction than the fictional passages are to what is expected of a good read. The work also contains a number of proofreading problems. And closer to the end of the book, when the heroine enters Russia, there are glaring mistakes in treating the country's geography and populations spread, such Odessa being north of Kiev (it is south of Kiev) and Ukrainian peasants performing for the Madame in the middle of Russia proper. Whether these are the only mistakes of such nature in the book or not is hard to judge, but they do raise an issue with the accuracy of other information."
2,keys wanabe,"It's not even a standard Peter Graves 50's B movie . But, It brings back those hokey Sci-Fi memories."
3,Looking for more technical help,"Since I wear the dba hat, developer hat, and all the other hats on this large (2 billion + data points) Oracle database, I need help for infrequent activities, like installing an upgrade (8.0 to 9i), migrating tables that are upwards of 20GB each, and making sure the new server is setup/configured optimally for the data warehouse. Based on the customer reviews, I bought this book. The level of technical help is insufficient in my specific areas of interest. The last book I bought for this was excellent, The Black Book for Oracle8 and Windows NT. And the books I bought from Oracle Press were also excellent. This book was not as helpful. The Oracle DBA Pocket Checklist is helpful, but you will need lots more than this book if you are the infrequent dba. So back to using Oracle Support and Oracle Press...."

1,Tmobile MDA stylus - wrong size,This product is slightly smaller than the original Tmobile MDA stylus. DO NOT BUY this product to replace your original stylus.
5,received in less than 24 hours,"product was as described in perfect new conditiongreat quality snow pants, but not designed for plus sized kids.fit perfectly everywhere, but tight in tummy."
5,They are really waterproof,"I don't care about the looks so much, but it was perfect for our kids when they were learning to ski or when we go sledding. They spend a lot of time falling in the snow and we don't want them to get wet. This does the trick."
5,Happy,Idem came on time and was the right one at the right cost. It was packed very will. I would buy from them again.
2,"C Hayes, TN","I actually have not used this product yet. I need someone to cut out the sheet rock where I plan to place my 50"" plasma tv to install additional studs so the tv will be centered on two to three studs. Once I have it installed, I will resubmit a review for this product.Thanks."
3,"for a low budget film, this was pretty good",I think Maia Campbell is beautful and it was nice to see her in a feature film. The script could have been a little better but I'm sure everyone can relate to the plot. I think we all have at least one crazy family member
3,not,"I was not paying much attention when I bought this, so it is more of my ooops than theirs. Okay?"
3,Unfortunately more long-suffering than daring,"Idea is great, the women are admirable but the actual images feel posed and stiff. Choices slant toward toward social activism. High-quality images but wish the subjects looked more dynamic."
2,Plastic,"This is my second shredder. The first one died after about 6 months... the teeth on its plastic gears broke off so it no longer worked. I replaced it with this shredder - the ag10x, as it is supposed to have metal gears. The gears may or may not be metal, I haven't checked, but there are spacers between the cutting blades that are plastic, and these are breaking and falling out, allowing the blades to slip and not cut. This one lasted about a year, so twice as long as the other one, but now I am again looking for something better."
1,I agree with previous reviewer.,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I had this machine for just over a year and some of the plastic spacers broke, rendering the machine inoperable. There are metal gears on the machine, but they are separated by plastic spacers. I understand from postings elsewhere that Royal won't sell parts due to safety concerns. So, now I'm left with a machine for rubbish day and a pile of unshredded materials."
3,Ketchup makes the best of the situation.,"AG10x has lasted for almost a year with light daily shredding so I do not feel that plastic parts have ruined quality of shredder.In my other review I wrote about plastic gears,I do not mean visible plastic spacers betwen cutting wheels but gears which are attached to electric motor inside shredder visible upon disassembly.One tip for any owners would be to remove door underneath which closes as basket fills and traps shredded paper inside cutter wheels jamming head.It then shuts down with warning light but one plastic spacer did not like treatment and slipped out of place.If shredder has problems like this do not reverse shredder,turn over and remove paper manually with tweezers.Also obey warning not to shred for more than two minutes,my old shredder died a horrible death because I shredded for 30 minutes.I shred my old credit card which is a rare event but I pre-flight shredder by checking underneath. (...)."
2,More narration than music.,This is a narration of Basie's life. Too much narration throughout the video and not enough music. There is not one song played from beginning to end completely.
4,Specific help to evaluate food allergy's role in arthritis,"Dr. Mansfield, a British allergy specialist, guides the reader to carefully and scientifically test for food allergies and their effect upon rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. He explains clearly each step to be taken and how to evaluate food allergy reactions. With this book, I have been able to understand how food allergies were causing serious arthritis symptoms and then take action to reduce pain and other symptoms."
5,The first book that ever made me cry,"I originally had to read this book for a class and approached it as ""required reading"". However, as soon as I began reading it, I couldn't put it down- I read it in one sitting! This was the first book that made me cry. I felt compassion for the characters Juletane and Helene. Vierya-Warner made the reader feel the isolation and despair that linked their stories together. This is one of my favorite books."
2,"Not Impressed, Too Much Romance!","On the back of the book, the summary makes ""Come Sundown"" seem like a psychological thriller that will be an interesting and exciting novel to read. Well, that is NOT THE TRUTH! This novel is practically ALL ROMANCE! This is one of the novels where Helen R. Myers is changing over to write mystery instead of romance, but there is way too much romance. I think they have sex in every 5 pages. I felt that the little mystery that there was, was VERY GOOD! I just didn't appreciate it that the back of the book made it sound more mystery than romance, when it was really the opposite."
1,Is this really 1997?,"""Come Sundown"" was a readable book but the book setting should have been in 1930 not 1997. I thought it was very offensive to people of african decent in Mississippi. It protrayed them as poor uneducated people who could only get jobs as maids and helpers. No offense Helen get your dates correct its 1997 not 1930."
4,Works but..,The bulb is installed and worked but it was about 20 minutes of re-wiring the thing to get it in. I guess if I was prepared for that it would not have been too bad but the wiring that comes attached to the bulb out of the box needed to be switched for the HC4900 (the wire is included in the box).Good price though and I would purchase again - although time will only tell how long the bulb will last so I may be updating this later.
3,An interesting historical overview,"What is presented here is a detailed accounting of the evolution of the policy of partition as a means of conflict resolution. Schaeffer traces the concept from its philosophical forebears into the present, and treats prominent empirical examples of partition (all failed, failing, or dubiously sustainable).An interesting account it certainly is, but analysis of the cases is lacking: the reader is presented with histories, and nothing but. Some ideas as to why partition is inclined to fail are mentioned, but are never tied coherently together in the form of a unitary theory. In all, a useful history, bringing together excellent historical analyses, but no meaningful theories are propagated herein."
5,George Fenton is the master of subtle emotion!,"the object of my affection is a movie that needed a composer to be sesititve to what was happening on screne. George was that man. he brought his gentle but genesis touch to a film full of emotions. The main title brings out the love and simpicity of the story. ""out to work"" brought out the quick wite and connection between a gay man and a straight woman. Overall, it is a wonderful score they got the right man to do the job. George Fenton is the best. He was the only man who could have given life to the unspoken emotions happening on screne. If you are wondering were he came from some of his other scores include Shadowlands, Ever After, and Anna and the king(with Jodie Foster). George you are a magnificent composer!"
3,Abridged 7 Habits Immediately Post 9/11,"This audiobook is a basic rehash of the 7 habits of highly effective people, set in the aftermath of 9/11. The material is OK, and if you are a Covey fan, the audiobook might be somewhat interesting. Having said that, it isn't a great stand alone work, and really could use more meat and less Covey advertising."
5,"Very solid, very nice.","After painting in light grey, I ordered enough of Brainerd wall plates for the entire downstairs livingroom and hallway. They feel extremely well made, with very solid, thick, heavy metal and a nice finish. They look great!Some of the units had rough edges around the screw holes. That's about the worst think I can say about them."
4,Kept me up turning pages while everyone slept,"I bought A Tourist in the Yucatan after reading some reviews of it on here. I'm glad to say that I was glad I went with the mostly positive reviews that I read and picked it up. The book was fast paced from the beginning and kept me up reading past my normal sleeping time on more than one night. A few of the characters were one dimensional and sterotypical (ex-athlete politician; washed up, alcoholic government agent) but most of the primary characters had more depth to them. I thought I had a few of the plots lines figured out at various points in the story, but after a few twists and turns I tried to stop guessing. Overall I gave it 4 stars."
1,Bad. Bad. Bad. You don't need this headache. Pass.,I tried on three different occasions to read this book and each time I was so frustrated with the poor grammar and lousy execution that I could not finish it. After the third attempt I said enough was enough. The basic plot has been done to death by many other authors and there is nothing James Brumfield adds that makes this book even remotely good. I now feel like I have been tricked by the review that recommended it. Even the scenery was lack luster and never made me feel like the book was set in a remote locale. This book completely misses the Central American backdrops and it could have literally taken place in any city. If you take away the names you'll see what I mean. That really speaks volume when an author cannot even capture the locales the story is suppose to take place in. Bad. Bad. Bad. You don't need this headache. Pass.
2,Life is too short for mediocre,"A man is on a boat in Mexico waiting for a drug deal to go down. The drug deal goes bad and he goes on the lam. Is he a bad guy or working undercover?A husband and wife are on a vacation in Mexico rekindling their marriage. They hope to connect with their friend who is an archeologist but they find themselves in the middle of a misunderstanding about drugs and ancient Mayan artifacts. Will they kill or be killed?Basically, this plot has been done a million times and is not original. But even worse, the writing is bland and does not keep the story moving. It took me FOREVER to plod through this thin paperback novel. It's fine for a beach read, but there are other books out there in this genre that are much, much better."
3,Fun Read,"I enjoyed this book, it was actually given to me when I was a child but I didn't get around to reading it until now (I'm 20). I am in college so I make it a point to read classics and it can be kind of stressful because I am trying to get as much as I can out the books. So to me The Arabian Nights was a break from all the pressure.The only thing that bothered me was that the endings were pretty much the same in all the stories and that is that the main characters all lived happily ever after to ripe old ages."
2,There are better choices for children,"As a father of a young child, I purchased this based on the other reviews. While it wasn't bad, it was rather dificult to stomach. It tries way too hard to be funny and misses out on teaching the kids any kind of lesson.The songs are in fact ""silly,"" but they aren't as catchy as some of the competition (i.e. the Wiggles). I cannot immagine being stuck in a car and having to listen to the DVD again and again for a long road trip.The video is mindless silly-ness on the same level as Looney Tunes, nothing more."
5,Finally BigIdea is using the DVD format.,We have each of the VeggieTales movies and are so happy that BigIdea is starting to use the DVD format. The difference between the (well used) videos and the DVD picture is unbelievable. There is a new (short) song on this video but most of it is old material. Even if you have the other videos get this on DVD to be able to see the songs as they were meant to be seen.
5,Never too young to start,"My four-month-old son loves these silly songs! I wanted to use it as a way to introduce him to Veggie Tales (""Why is there a dancing pickle?""). And he immediately loved it. Usually, when I play anything other than his favorite Baby Einstein collection, he just screams and only Baby Mozart will do. But he loves the Ultimate Silly Song Countdown -- the colors, movement, music (especially the silly tones and inflections used). Another plus is that *it isn't annoying for parents to hear*! I know just a few words of the songs, and when I sing them to my son, he gives me a great big smile and laugh. I need to learn more so my husband and I can sign these silly songs all around the house!"
4,Thought it was a music cd not dvd,The dvd is good no complaints about that but I would have preferred the audio cd. Had a lot of the good older silly songs for those of you that have seen veggie tales from the beginning.
2,Marshalling the Faithful,"I am pretty sure (based on his other books) that the book is a good / great read. Though the condition of the book was totally un-acceptable. the site stated the book was in very good condition, but when it arrived, the cover was torn and tattered, and several pages were crinkled and not a very attractive cover or an over all appearance. I would send the book back, but the mailing costs would be much more than the book had cost initially."
1,Looks nice but beware,"Great looking frame, was very happy when I received and installed it. However, I came to find out that the lettering is not enamel or paint but a glued on decal type. After one month the last E came off, luckily I found it in my driveway and glued it back on. A few weeks later 2 more letter came off. I then tried to remove all of the letters, figured I would try to paint it myself, but I scratched the plate in the process and just threw it away. Spend another $5 - $10 and get one that is painted instead of pressed on..."
3,"Works for my purpose, but not very well","I bought this to be able to use my 3 D-cell LED Maglite as an area light. It works, but the plastic this is made of is very opaque and a lot of the light doesn't seem to get through it."
2,Decieving pix,The picture shows four cushions and ear pieces. Only the sponge of the car piece is sent.
1,NOT what the picture shows,"Your add is very misleading! I ordered what I saw in your picture, ear buds. I was sent two pieces of foam rubber that cost about 20 cents. And was charged $6.12 for shipping when a 50 cents would have been too much. I request a full refund or the product shown in your add. RMA form was filled out and never received RMA or refund "". // Amazon did refund full cost to me when I requested it. Amazon, Thank you"
1,dont waste your money!!,"This has to be THE WORST MOVIE I have ever watched, a complete waste of my time and money, I hope all future purchasers read my review and act on it - DO NOT buy this, it really is 100% rubbish - GUARANTEED!!!!"
2,looks cool but it not works as a mousepad,"my mouse doesn't work on this, the pointer moves badly, like vibrating. On the other hand it looks cool. If you want it as a decorative-non-mousepad then it is for you. As a mouserug I wanted it as a mousepad then I give it 2 stars. Hope this review helps you make the choice."
3,Royal Media Destroyer - MD100,"Replaced an Excutive Cross Cut shredder that was operating for 3 yrs.CON: Pricey for a little item. I expected a larger/taller shredder bin, emptying the bin often. Throat is small, must fold the papers in 1/2 (lenghtwise). Can't access the blades to clean if self-adhesive labels get stuck.PRO: The enclose bin keeps the paper dust contained. It does the job. Won't know the Shredder's life span, hopefully it will out live my previous shredder."
5,Needed Addition If You're A Fan,"This set kicks! A very jammin', intense performance from this bluesrock outfit at its peak. However, the sound is less than stellar, certainly not as well-recorded as the Dead's sets just a couple of weeks earlier at the same venue. The muddiness gives it a dark and a fat bottom but will probably put off those who aren't fans of this group (as will the long jams). The fans will rationalize the audio, which I give as a 6.5 out of 10, because of the performance, which is a 10 out of 10!! If you love TYA, defintely buy this. If you like jammin' bluesrock from this period, you should probably buy this. If you are neither, why are reading this far?"
4,Nicely Done,"I experienced no install problems whatsoever, and found it easier than falling off a log to load and run. Game play is a little slow, with many film clips, but the story makes sense and is pleasurable. Graphics are very nice and the puzzles are, like all Atlantis games, playful and enjoyable. I am not finished yet, but it is already much more fun than Schizm ever hoped to be. The Skull puzzle is truly original! I enjoyed the subtle references to past Atlantis games (dolphin, flyers, etc.) but you can play this without knowing about them with out any interruption to game play or plot. The main character is charmingly drawn and her movements are very realistic. DreamCatcher has come a long way in their animations. A pleasent game."
1,Beyond Atlantis 2,"XP Users beware !Even though ""Beyond Atlantis 2"" is XP compatibleaccording to the product box, it does not seem to work with XP.The game crashes to the desktop at the first cut scene. The error can be reproduced every time the game is run therefore making it unplayable.I am very disappointed as the graphics of the introductionary video are truely beautiful and breathtaking.After contacting techsupport at the Dreamcatcher website and following all their suggestion and troubleshooting, the game is still crashing.While surfing the Dreamcatcher support forum, I learned that many users with XP have this exact same issue and that Dreamcatcher does not appear concerned enough about it, to write a patch even though it affects so many customers.My computer is less than two month old, pentium 4, 2.5 Ghzwith all the latest drivers and newest DirectX version.Myst Exile and all my other games run flawlessy by the way."
2,Don't Buy if you have XP,"Okay I bought this game and I have some pros and a really big con. The pros are that the graphics are very good. The 360 degree pan feature is awesome and the puzzles and music are great. Now for the really big con. It will absolutely not work with Windows XP. I cannot get past the sarcophagus scene in the beginning. I have tried everything. Cleaning my registry, reinstalling, uninstalling, not installing direct X, using a saved game, lowering the acceleration rate of my sound and graphics, nothing works. It is a shame too because the graphics are really good."
1,Impossible to Install,"Received game yesterday. Went into loop when disc 1 inserted.Could only stop by powering down. Tried disabling autoinsertion notification on CD drive and running setup.exe.System (Win98SE) said ""setup.exe not a valid win32 app.""Tried naked boot of win98 (run msconfig and eliminate runningautoexec.bat, config.sys and all the startup group items).Still says ""setup.exe not a valid win32 app.""Noted that the date on this setup.exe is 10/2/98 while thedate on the earlier Beyond Atlantis is 1/13/99. Why use anolder setup.exe? Dreamcatcher customer service no helpand no call back."
1,Sheer disappoinment,"After the brilliance of Beyond Atlantis (Atlantis 2), I fought hard to get a copy of BA2...... Whoa, what a disappointment! From the wooden voice over delivery of the principal (I am an Acting and Voice coach so have a little experience here) to the uninspired plot, worlds, and game in general. Additionally, the game ran very roughly on my computers (new one, well within the min. req)and failed to keep my interest. Did finish it, though-- in only a few hours. If you must play this game, wait until it hits your local electronics discount store in the $4.99 bin."
3,sometimes boring,"The game in the whole is not bad although it doesn't tie well together. Every adventure is not linked to the other. You change worlds, collect items and solve puzzles, but basically every world is a new start. There is only one element that links the whole game, the dolphin in the skull and that part is really boring since you have to look for the dolphin but there is really no way to find it but luck! I was hoping for something more challenging. The storyline was a bit lame also."
3,I've played better,"I'm not a hard core gamer, but even I realized that this game is just above average. It was far too short, the main character's voice acting was horrible, and the story had no depth. I found myself wondering what the big deal with the skull was, and it ended right where it should have begun. The graphics were wonderful and the puzzles were fun, but it only kept me occupied for 2 days. If you want a true gaming experience, go for the ""Myst"" series; those games are a true treat."
1,Fun Game but too SHORT!,"I really liked this game- great graphics and storyline- sort of ties in with Beyond Atlantis 1. But the game is short- Beyond Atlantis 1 took MUCH longer, and I loved that about it. This game is great, but I couldn't believe it ended so fast. Needed to be longer- definitely."
5,A classic!,"Colette Brooks has joined the ranks of writers like E.B. White and Jane Jacobs with her beautiful new book, IN THE CITY. Brooks' subtly poetic prose, gentle humor, and eye for the telling detail open the city to the reader, revealing its soul. Anyone who has ever lived in, or dreamed of living in, a city will find this book resonating with echoes of their own feelings and dreams. It is impossible to put it down and impossible to leave it behind. One returns to the book again and again relishing special moments, phrases and insights. Ms. Brooks writes beautifully, sparely and with a unique voice."
2,It's Mesh!,"It really needs to be mentioned in the product description that this backpack is made of mesh fabric. You can kind of tell if you look at the enlarged views, but I just thought it was a pattern on the fabric. If you intend to buy an all mesh, transparent backpack, you'll probably like it a lot more than I do."
4,Makes a good gym bag!,"This has become my gym bag. The material is all mesh material, so there is a lot of air flow. (And not much security if that is important to you). My towel gets nice and dry between workouts. Lots of pockets for gym card and padlock, workout book and towel, cell phone, etc. A good little bag at the right price."
4,Lookout! Freakout!,"This was my first punk record,and it kicks!Great songs from Black Cat Music,The Queers,Ann Beretta and Amarican Steel.This record also has bands from the Panic Button label.BUY IT!..."
3,"Fun, danceable, albeit a little silly for the older ones",Was not our favorite children's CD but we still had a good time with it. Was not as enduring as some for the kids.
1,what is up with this...?,"i am currently 25 years old and single. often times, i find myself in a car and i wish there was some music playin. you know the kind, it goes all ""bump...bump..bumpity boo"" and stuff. anyways, i gots myself a copy of ""sugar"". i did not like it at all. i dont think children should have this cd either, seein as they cant drive and all. i have to go to work, so i will check you all later. peace..."
3,"The first major release to show full frontal nudity of both male and female performers, and genuine intercourse on screen...","In the sixties, the Swedish films were known to be the most sexually graphic, but this is the one that really rocked the world... It was shocking in its uninhibited portrayal of sex and in its fulminating piece of social democracy... It was a significant step forward in getting the adult film shown in the theaters...The film comes in two editions, blue and yellow... The blue version focuses more on the political issues and the yellow concentrates on the emergence of sexual liberation...The lead character is a young Swedish girl who attempts to hold fast to her philosophy of nonviolence, free love, and democratic socialism... But the realities of her life force her to adopt new and unrestrained ideologies...Strangely enough, in Sweden, it was criticized more for its left-wing attitudes than for its audacious display of sex..."
5,Should Have Gone to the Top of the Charts,This CD is excellent. It is beyond my comprehension why it did not go to the top of the charts when it released -- it blows away many that have. Back Street Boys blow -- Lifter's where it's at!
3,Great Book from my Childhood,"I've been looking everywhere for this book. Most are collectors items and are selling for $150 or more. I do have to admit it could have been in better condition for the price, but I'm happy to have it to read to my grandchild."
1,Terrible,"This book was one of the cheesiest books I've ever read. I actually had to force myself to finish it. The main character (Ned) in this book seemed to experience everything.. he was frends with Harvey Milk, he was in riots, friends with a porn star, went to the first Beetles concert, saw Sylvester in concert, he was in Vietnam, etc, etc, etc. Somehow he was every gay event except Studio 54! It was written terribly, plots were totally contrived and loosely thrown together. Every time the character moved his residence, I had to think of what gay event the author wanted to cram in the storyline and pretend his character participated. No true feeling to the book, I couldn't identify with the main character... I can't believe anyone liked this book!Terrible, just terrible."
4,Insightful and Great for Younger Generation to Read,"I enjoyed this book and looked forward to getting back to it before bed each night. Each section is full of interesting historic insights that should be a must read for the younger generation, especially those that deal with the reality of AIDS in the 80s and the devestation it bought on the gay community. Other areas of interest were the Harvey Milk assasination and Vietnam. While this book cover's a gay man's coming of age and his life journey the historic fabric is what I found to be of most interest. It is easy to forget the past and I think it is vital for the younger generation to learn the struggles of the brave members of generations past that have made being a Gay American, a better place for all. We still have a long way to go but the last 30 years have bought about sweeping changes. Enjoy the book, it is worth reading."
5,I cried. . .,I have been reading Michael Thomas Ford books and novels for a long time now. This is the first time that his work made me cry. I'm used to laughing at his humor. I have a friends who is a little older and from time to time tells me what it was like in the 70's and 80's as a gay man. For a while I felt like my friend was telling me this story.When I got to the last few chapters I was reading and noticed that I was crying all of the sudden. It's not often that a book can have that effect on someone. I would recommend this book for sure.
5,Veggies at their finest,Awesome movie. Really enjoyed it and laughed alot. One of the best one's yet!
5,Lyle the Kindly Viking,"We own all of the veggie tales and we love them all! They entertain the kids as well as the adults! I never have to worry about what they are watching when I put a veggie tales in. Or how much they are watching, when the movie is over I know that they didn't spend all day in front of the tv. They are the best inventions in kid entertainment yet! And the morals in the stroies realy rub off on my kids!"
3,Lyle the Kindly Viking Review by Nicky,"This is the first Veggie Tales video since 1995 (Are you My Neighbor?) which has had two episodes. Both teach about Sharing.The first episode, ""Omelet"", (Hamlet originally) is about a prince who has an omelet, made with the last eggs of the town. But then realizes by the help of others to share it. So he shares his eggs with the people.""Lyle the Kindly Viking"" is about a viking (Lyle) who doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the gang. He shares with others. The gang doesn't like him. But when a storm comes, Lyle helps the others. And the gang realizes that they should share.A fun movie from Big Idea, teaches Sunday Morning Values, Saturday Morning Fun! That's a Big Idea!"
3,"Lively Songs, Quality Animation With Strong Moral Message","High quality animation, lively songs, fast pace, upbeat, playful. Amusing characters teach kids about sharing. Strong moral message with Christian content make it particularly useful for church programs. The children were very entertained and commented: ""It was funny and cute and we loved it."" ""Lyle helped everyone and gave them potholders."" ""The songs were cool."" ""It made me want to share."" ""I liked to see the Veggies hop around."" Best for ages 2 to 5."
5,A Great Veggie Musical,"My 2 year old daughter loves to watch Veggie Tales and I am a huge fan of musicals so when I saw that this was a musical Veggie Tale story I just had to buy it. How can you not enjoy a movie with a play called ""Omlet"" in it and the main feature about a group of singing Vikings?!!! We really enjoy watching all the Veggie Tale movies that have come out so far and look forward to many more. The only problem I have with these movies is the song that is sung at the beginning of each one because I can't get it out of my head for days after listening to it. Oh well, at least it has a nice beat!"
4,Morbid and macabre,"This is an excellent rendering of some of Quiroga's best short stories. Not only does the translation capture the menace and tension of Quiroga's narrative technique, but also his stunningly vivid descriptions of nature. Blood-sucking spiders, poisonous snakes and insane children make victims of unsuspecting human beings in macabre and morbid ways. Gripping stuff."
3,"I very much like the stories within, however...","I very much like the stories within, however...there are many passages highlighted in any of three different colors. I intended to gift the book, but cannot. The author and his story telling is captivating and I shall keep the book for my own library. In these tales the author describes death and dying with a fascinating understanding and realism."
3,A Horror Writer,"If _The Decapitated Chicken_ were a new work by a US author, it would probably be marketed in the ""horror"" genre. Its status as an older classic by a Latin American writer means it is instead marketed as ""magic realism."" Do not, however, confuse this with the gentle works of such writers as Marquez and Allende.Almost every story ends with at least one gruesome death. Many stories are entirely devoted to anticipating that death. The protagonist gets bitten by a viper or slashes himself with a machete at the beginning, then dies for the next several pages. There's not actually much ""magic realism"" in these stories, aside from a few talking animals.The prose is certainly vivid, even in translation. If you like horror, I recommend this book. I'll stick to Marquez and Allende."
2,"Bad, just plain bad","At one time, a few years ago, when I thought of Steve Bauer, I'd think of Thief of Hearts. Now, after seeing this, it just gives me shudders. Not only was his acting abdominable, his appearance was awful. Someone (Hollywood guru) help this guy through whatever he is going through!"
1,What part is Navajo?,The acting and theme of this film is fictional and degrading of the culture it is trying to present. I rate this film next to zero because it does nothing but create more typical sterotypes of the Navajo people.
3,Bedard gets the stars,"Nick Epps (Bauer) is a cop in trouble. He's seen a mob hit and now he's got to go into Witness Protection until the trial. They hide him on the Navajo Reservation under the name of John Cole. In the typical cop 'odd couple' scenario, Epps/Cole is assigned to Officer Audrey Wyako (Bedard) on a Navajo Indian Reservation.Naturally, things heat up on the rez as soon as Cole gets there. A serial killer Not Lightning Struck (Ed O'Ross) is the very creepy perp, a Navajo witch.There's so much wrong with this film, it's hard to say what to discuss first. It's just cheesy. First, with all the wonderful Native American music they could use, the soundtrack is just bad. Second, the dialog is dreadful. Third, there's just no mystery and I'm pretty blue that there's very little Navajo culture involved.The only good aspect of this film is Bedard. She's beautiful and excellent as always.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
2,botherhood,"Its not as good as the previuos CD...too similar to other music of this type...did not allow for the individual musicians to express themselves, which is their strong point if you listen to the other cd"
2,Ouch,"It's hard to believe that a Nicholas Ray film starring Humphrey Bogart could have turned out this badly. The problem is the script, which combines poor plot structure with leaden social commentary. Throw in some of the most laughably unrealistic courtroom scenes imaginable and you've got a near-total disaster. The only thing keeping this movie out of the one-star category is the occasional flash of acting or directing talent that intermittently rises above the dreadful script."
3,Court room drama,"Bogie (as a lawyer) defends John Derek (as the defendant) on a cop-killing charge. This movie is mainly for Bogie and/or court room drama fans (like Perry Mason, or Matlock), but Bogie DOES make a good ""theatrical"" lawyer. The story is not new, the ""defense"" is not new, the ""twist"" is not new (but nothing is really new in court room dramas anyway), but the acting is good, and thereby saves the film. Watchable."
4,Season 2 collection 2 episodes,206. All Too Human207. Una Salas Victus208. Home Fires (with Sam Jenkins Sorbo--Kevin Sorbo's real-life wife)209. Into the Labyrinth
2,Review of Frozen Alive Instant Video,Amazon has a bunch of reviews here from a DVD set that contains this film. I hope this review does not get linked into that set. I looked this up in the IMDB. It was made in 1964 and should have been 80 or 81 minutes long. Amazon says 2006. And their copy was just over an hour. The Sci Fi takes a back seat here. It is really more of a police drama. The acting was rather good. But there are some jarring cuts where I suppose some of the film is missing. I saw it on Prime for free and I got my money's worth. I don't regret spending the hour watching it. But once was enough. I won't be watching it again.
3,Corny...but good.,A little far fetched but fun to watch and an interesting look at how we were seeing science back in the 50's.
1,Strange Tales 20 movie pack,"Slightly better than ""Alien Worlds"" movie pack. But, as with the ""Alien Worlds"" multi-movie pack, this is disappointing. The production quality is just not there. The movie selection was marginal at best. The remastering quality is not good. I would not buy this again. If it wasn't so cheap I would be very unhappy, but I got what I paid for."
4,Yay For Yuki :D,"This plushie is so kawaii! I thought it was so adorable when I saw it so I just HAD to get it! Yuki cosplaying as a rat, it was just cute...I have had this toy for two years and it still looks new. The hair has started to come off a little, but no that much. I sleep with it every night.And another cool thing about it is that you can take the hood off of it! It was so cool!So if you like Yuki and plushies, I really recommend you to get it ^^"
2,Hood-tastic.,"""Hood Angels"" is the kind of movie you can only fully appreciate when you are with at least three other people, and you all are completely and totally trashed. A poor script, bad actors, and horrible editing create a piece of art that, if not totally intoxicated, would make you want to gouge your eyes out.Rated two stars for the fantastically quotable lines.""Whatchu in here for, hookin'?"""
3,Adriaen Block,"More a history of Dutch navigation than a specific history of Adriaen Block. Van Loon told the same story better in his other books. However, this is a rarity; privately published, there were supposedly only 500 copies printed (my copy is No. 498, that I bought for $1.50 50 years ago). So it's more a collector's item than anything else."
4,Childrens Book,This book has good illustration and the story is basically cinderella with a guy as cinderella. Only young children would enjoy it in my opinion.
2,It is only 5.5 inches deep,I guess that on purpose they do not state the depth of this item. It is very narrow for most applications. I measured only 5.5 inches in depth.
4,Havana scent,"I was a bit apprehensive to purchase a candle this expensive, but I was very pleased with the scent, clean burning, and look of the candle and the packaging it came in. The Havana is a scent that both my husband and I enjoyed."
2,"I so wanted to like it, but...","After reading so many positive reviews and being a fan of certain citrusy smells and notes, I was certainly intrigued. After all, who can hate blood orange? I must be the first one b/c I certainly dislike this perfume with gusto -- enough to write a review! I have to say I haven't tried that pungent of a smell in a long time. The description was correct in saying that it's fresh, and I certainly should've listened to that closer. It is indeed fresh, not sweet or powdery, or musky. The orange that I smell is so synthetic that it almost makes me dizzy and nauseated. The bitterness in it is also unpleasant to me. The staying power appears to be decent, and that's the reason I gave it two stars rather than one. Stella-a-a -- rude, obnoxious, and is here to stay."
3,Low and Sweet...,"I bought this CD because it features one of my favorite actors - Dermott Mulroney - in the band.It reminds me a little of Cajun music with the mix of stringed instruments, and energetic arrangements...there are also a couple ballads thrown in - the vocalist bugs me a little bit, but the album on the whole is an interesting and playful listen."
5,mgracer,"Deeply layer both musically and emotionally. Succesfully complex music without getting lost in the background. It all blends together beautifully. I have never played this albumn for anyone how didn't love it, regardless of what style of music they tend to listen to."
5,I'm not a big country fan and I bought this CD...,"I am not a big country fan and I bought this CD. In this case, video sold the music. I happened to catch the video of ""A Good Day to Run"", liked it, and liked Darryl. To be honest, after its initial play, I was rather ambivalent about this CD...a little too country for me. Then, I listened again....and again....and again...and again....These are great songs! And how can you not like someone who makes the effort to thank so many people who have believed in him, that it takes up an entire page of the CD insert, with the tiniest print?! Darryl Worley co-wrote 10 of the 12 songs on this CD; very admirable, indeed. My four favorites? ""A Good Day to Run"" (a great ""first thing in the morning"" song), ""Hard Rain Don't Last"", ""Second Wind"" (which makes me want to take the next jet south to the Gulf of Mexico and sit at the water's edge), and ""When You Need My Love"". I'm so happy that I bought this CD!"
3,Super!!,"I really enjoy this CD, every time I put it on, I like it even more. He has a flare with his words like ""old"" Jimmy Buffet songs, great phrases and stories. It's worth getting and I will buy the next one and the next after that!!"
4,Great Music,"I have known Darryl all his life. He is a really good guy and weare all very proud of him. My Father, Ed Howard is the one thattaught Darryl how to play the guitar. He is the older gentlemanyou see at the start of the video A Good Day To Run. He is veryproud of how far Darryl has gone with his music. It is a thrillfor me to turn on CMT and see my Dad and Darryl. Of course thatis my favorite video. I just saw Darryls new video I Miss My Friend. It really touched my heart because my best friend passedaway last June. She was also Darryls aunt. I love all his songsbut I think that one will be my favorite. I wish Darryl all theluck in the world and look forward to his next CD. Thank you forgiving his fans a place to express their views."
4,Cookbook has same flare as novels,"If you enjoyed reading(or watching) Fannie Flagg's ""Fired Green Tomatoes"", you'll love the cookbook as well. She shares her love for food and the past by giving us recipes from her Aunt's railroad-side restaurant(the original Whistle Stop Cafe), as well as lines from the book FGT. I've tried the BBQ chicken, mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, and egg custard pie all to family satisfaction. So whether you like Southern cooking or Fannie Flagg, get this book. You won't regret it."
5,No longer do I put store bought food in a piece of Pyrex...,"No longer do I have to put store bought food in a piece of Pyrex and take it to a family reunion. I am happy to say that I can make all the delicious food from `down home"". The biscuits, gravy, pies, chicken and dumplings, the list goes on and on, all are easy to make with a short list of ingredients. Now, if I could learn to talk southern..."
4,Old time Cooking,"This book contains old receipes that have been passed down for generations or that you might have heard Aunts, or grandmothers talking about. I have used these receipes and shared with many."
5,One of the most used cookbooks I own!,"The only problem I have with this cookbook is choosing between all the delicious recipes between its cover! My favorite? I can't choose just one but will start with the Kentucky Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Pie, Mississippi Mud Cake, Good ol' Southern Pecan Pie, Lemon Ice Box Pie, Southern Banana Pudding, Vanilla Custard Ice Cream, etc. and that is just the desserts! Everything I make from this cookbook gets rave reviews and requests to please share my secret recipes. My copy is one of the original hardbacks that came out right after the movie but I have purchased numerous copies of the paperback to give to family and friends as gifts."
5,To die for!,"I'm not a Southerner, but I can cook like one by using this cookbook. I always make the pecan pie recipe for my husband's birthday. Not exactly low-cal, or low-fat...(you get the point) but so delicious."
5,Great down home cooking,"While I'm a Yank and don't really understand the South's love of grits and collard greens, a lot of these recipes are simple, easy to make recipes with no fussy, exotic ingredients I've never heard of and don't have on hand. Also, the names of the recipes are easy to pronounce."
5,Glad I bought it,"The recipes look good, plus the anecdotes and quotes are funny and interesting. I grew up in the South but left many years ago. Both the recipes and the editorial (though brief) took me home again."
5,down home cookin',I grew up in southern Illinois and the recipes in this book are just like my granny cooked.If you grew up with down home cooking and not the fancy food you see in today's cookbooks than this will be a book you will pass down from generation to generation.I really love to read the tidbits she adds to the pages and all the old time pictures.
4,Three reasons to read Laura Ingalls,"1. I recommend this book to people that love geography because they can find all ways that Laura did with her family. She traveled many times and the place is the old west in United States. It is amazing!!!!2. If you want find a woman with brave and encourage in the life you have to read Laura Ingalls. She shows us that the life is hard, but also that we have to fight and reach our goals.3. This book is easy to read, so you can finish it in a couple of hours. I am sure you will have a very good time. Good luck!!!!"
5,This is an excellent book about Laura Ingalls Wilder,"William Anderson has written an interesting and enlightening book about one of America's best loved authors. Although I had read all of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books, I had never really developed a sense for who she was until reading Anderson's biography. For anyone who loves history and the pioneer way of life this is an excellent book. For young readers, it is an education to a much simpler way of life, and the answer to what happened to Laura as an older adult."
4,Good Book!,"I recommended The book named ""Laura Ingalls: Abiography"" written by William Anderson. I have three reasons I recommended.First I feel that Laura has good personality. I learn a lot of things from this character. So it will be helpful for our life to be a good person.Second, this story is a family story and is also a success story. And then this story will make us feel happy.Third this book is it is easy to read. To read easier might be possible to try reading other book and image many things about this book. So it is good for us who need reading skill.That is all I recommended it."
4,Laura Ingalls Wilder: A Biography (Little House),This paperback was great reading. It answered a lot of questions that I had and also filled in a lot of gaps. It made me wish that I was around when Laura was alive so that I could have written her a 'fan' letter. Remarkable woman as was her whole family. I now watch the DVD series with new eyes and more interest (if that was possible).
3,Why do I like this book?,"I recommend Laura Ingalls. When I read books in English , it is very difficult to me. But I read this book, I felt I wanted to go no reading. When I read other books, some books make me sleeping. It is difficult to understand it. This is an interesting book. I like her character. She loved adventure. She wanted to a pioneer. She had huge brave. When she was in trouble , she always told herself to be brave. She overcame all of the trouble. So I like this book."
3,"A strong Woman, Laura..","We can learn a history of settlement of the West. I can know how did the pioneers made their life, and what did they do to live.Laura was very strong woman. She was different other plain women. She was special.The book shows us that people overcome their difficulty. Laura and her family were placed in difficult circumstances several times. But on all such occasions they never gave up. They always tried to overcome the difficult problems. As a result, they could solve problems very well."
3,I recommend,I recommend1. I like pioneer story. Especially Lara Ingalls book described vary well pioneer.2. This book have good family story.3. I like main character. She
1,"I'm the original ""give it a break"" guy...","but this movie has got to be the worst horror movie. I'll see bad review on other horror movies and I'll still watch them for the fun of it. This movie was so bad that the laughter stopped about 1/4th of the way through. Then we tried to watch because we wanted to see these irritating, bad-acting, mumbling people get killed. But the deaths were [bad], the killer was a joke, the sound [was horrible], quality was non-existent and did I mention that these people couldn't act. The fact that they even tried was bad enough. To top it all off, I can't even tell what the hell happened. Forget about Plan 9 From Out of Space being the worst movie, but at least it's fun to watch (sometimes). I would try to credit these people as making this [stuff] while [under the influence], but no self respecting [individual] would have put this out.Ax'em probably refers to each and every copy of this video."
1,Where's MST3K when you need it?,"Okay, this is officially THE worst movie ever made. I'VE made better stuff than this for high school classes. Why was this made? Why was there a 15 minute scene involving a step team and a load of ""Yo Mama"" jokes that the viewer can't hear due to a slight ineptitude with a boom mike? WHY IS THERE A CHARACTER NAMED BREAKFAST? I really don't understand this. This movie is horrible, and this is coming from a guy who owns and cherishes a copy of I EAT YOUR SKIN. Now THERE'S an entertaining bad movie. THIS, however, is not even laughably bad. This hurts me. This hurts me so much. Please, don't buy this movie. Go for a walk. Read a good book. Take your significant other out to a dinner at Arby's. Just DO NOT, EVER, watch this movie. I'm begging you."
1,"Horrible Picture Quality, Horrible Acting,HORRIBLE MOVIE",Ax Em is by far the worst horror movie or movie Iv'e ever seen next to House of the Dead. The movie starts out with a man with an ax that kills a old man(offscreen)and the opening credits show a bunch of black kids dancing and then black kids visitng the woods and then a killer stalks them. The movie is boring and unintentionally hilarious and even the background music is rap and the acting makes High Schoolers look professional compared to this mess. A terrible movie also gets some really awful video quality because the picture is blurry and colors bleed in each scene. Please avoid this trash and rent something better. Even for a no-budget horror indie flick this one is a real blunder.
1,So bad I don't even have the words,"This movie was easily the worst movie ever created. The deaths are a joke, the acting is horrendous, the dialogue is painful, the audio on some parts doesn't exist, and the cuts are childish. They didn't even try. One scene, when there is supposed to be a police car outside with flashing lights, you can clearly see a police light mounted on the wall, showing off the light. The first death of the movie is comical (but not supposed to be). There is one scene of a girl running in the woods that loops. In one scene you can see the time coding on the bottom of the screen. Getting the point? If you are into bad movies, rent this one. You're sure to get a good laugh."
1,Yuck!,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, it has no script, lame jokes, bad editing, poor acting. The worst movie. It had no plot. Don't wast your time. But if you really want to see it. Go to your local Hollywood video and rent it for $3."
1,???(no name do not want any one to know I saw it),"The worst movie ever, Plan 9 from outer space is an oscer winner next to this.one. Nothing good to say about this one."
1,Can you stand torture,"If you like pain and suffering, then I HIGHLY recommend watching this. There aren't enough words to describe to the agony. If a 3 month old baby made this film, then the explaination for the quality of this movie would be understandable. However, these were grown people. These people had a ""movie budget,"" ""plot,"" ""script,"" ""actors,"" and an ""experienced crew."" The overall result was a ""worse than normal"" student film.On the flip side....If you need to relax your mind, have a good laugh, or just want to build mental endurance, then watch this movie."
1,Don't let the cover fool you! Deceptive advertising.,"This is the worst movie ever made and the transfer to DVD was about as bad they get. I was expecting to have to adjust the tracking but then remembered it was DVD. Home movies patched together to form a semblance of a 70 minute movie. I can't believe they even had credits. Fortunately, anytime I have trouble falling asleep I just pop this baby into the DVD player and I'm out like a light. Watch for the Special Features, it's Stereo. Hahahahah."
2,the seller stinks,"Looks cute, seems a bit wide for a 0-3 size, the seller stinks though, they charched me over $3 for each headband (I ordered 2 from them) even though they came in one envelope. Not ordering from them again!"
5,Helped our St. Bernard - she has NO hip sockets,"Our St. Bernard literally has no hip sockets...resulting in challenging joint problems in her hips. Being a rather large dog, she could easily have other joint problems.Our veterinarian recommended Comfort for the high amount of high quality anti-oxidants, and as an alternative to other, more usual, joint medications.She's now eight years old, longer lived than expected...and still doing very well.She does much better with Comfort than when we run out.Buying through Amazon gives us the best price I've found anywhere, and I've looked a lot."
5,Simply Profound,"A first pass through this book makes it seem too easy to turn from a typical over-achieving, stressed out manager into a true leader. But that is the beauty of the book and Bethanis' insights into leadership coaching. Via the easy-reading, entertaining style we get to see how a few fundamental shifts in perspective, some honest feedback and a few simple tools can make profound changes in the performance and fulfillment of an up-and-comer in today's fast-paced corporate world. Great read for someone seeking self-development, looking to develop team members, or just curious about what corporate coaching is all about. Simple, practical tools are included so there is a mix of story and ""how to."" This book will serve as a regular reference for me as a leader. Bravo Bethanis!"
4,New Breed Of Rock Band,"Lately it seems there has been a New Breed Of Rock Band popping up all over the radio and on MTV, replacing the Boy Band/Pop sound that was popular a few years ago. One of these new groups is Diffuser. I really like their rock sound. I would highly recommend them to anyone interested in rock. Their sound is very similar to another one of my favorite groups--The Foo Fighters; and anyone who knows that group would surely like this group. Diffuser's album ""Making The Grade"" deserves a rating of 4 stars or higher. My favorite track on the album is ""New High"". If you haven't heard this band yet, buy this album. I guarantee you won't be dissatisfied."
3,"Good Music, Vocals OK","I haven't actually bought the album, but I was hit by a pop-up about Diffuser. On it were three selects from their new album, Making the Grade, Get It On, Here's To You, and I Wonder. These three tracks display a common pop-punk type of music. I Wonder is a punk ballad that you often hear on the radio, singing about a lost girl or regretting a decision in a relationship, etc...The guitar and drumming are quite skillful, but nothing extravagant. Nothing stood out to me. However, they strained on the vocals a little, and their lyrics weren't the best. However, if you are a pop or punk fan of Good Charlotte, Blink 182, The Starting Line, or The All-American Rejects, this album would appeal to you."
3,The Myth of Judy Garland,"Like several other biographers (most recently Gerald Clarke), Anne Edwards makes the mistake of taking Garland herself as the ultimate authority on her own life--and since Garland never let the truth get in the way of a good story and frequently recast the facts in order to justify her excesses, this is a very serious mistake indeed.Even so, the book is written in a very readable, slightly romanticized style, and while you have to take it with a whole shaker of salt it does a very good job of presenting Garland as she herself wished to be perceived--and in that sense Garland fans will find it quite interesting. But for a serious biography of Garland, I recommend Christopher Finch's RAINBOW and Gerald Frank's JUDY."
2,well...,"I think that Anne Edwards is a very good author, i have read her bookds on judy, vivien leigh, shirlet temple etc. I think that there is a bit of hero- worship going on in her Judy book though. I dont see it as terribly accurate, but its quite a good read so if you want to get it,. But if you wabnt a detailed account of her life i would recomend grold franks book."
4,An 'underground' primer on anabolic steroids!,"This is a good book for the potential first- (or second-) time anabolic steroid user as well as the merely curious. Experienced users would probably find little in this book that was new, however. The author does not 'moralize' about steroid use; he just gives the facts (along with the necessary disclaimers.*) This book exposes some of the myths and uncommon information on steroids and their use, provides brief descriptions of some common performance-enhancing steroids, and even advises the reader about where to get steroids, how to use them, and the right way to get off them. *Readers in the US should note (as the author does,) that possession of anabolic steroids is illegal in this country."
3,"A book for beginner, not for medium","This book is for begginner, not for medium. I already knew all of the information in this book. I think only the beginners can buy this book. I like ""World Anabolic Review 1996"" by P. Grunding and M. Bachmann more."
1,"""straight garbage""","This book is a complete flop! They hype this book so much that you think your buying a quality reference guide, and in all actuality most people know more about steroids and bodybuilding than the writers! I would never suggest that anyone buy this worthless piece of material for any reason at all."
1,I could have bought MuscleMag for $5 and learned more.,Maybe I was expecting too much because of the price. I already knew all of the information in this book and would have learned more by reading a good bodybuilding magazine.
1,unserious book,"This book is totally unserious, by the way the book dos not come in good quality standard, but instead in a ... paper condition. The book contains few pages the book is superficial. AND the worst thing is that i actually bought 2 copy of this book."
5,"6 inch hand held , worth the money..","used this auger for the first time, no huffin an Puffin, easy to use, 5"" of ice in15 seconds, no problem, I am using it after pulling a sled and shantiy approx 1/4 mile out on the ice.. put in 2 holes quick an easy , am 57 years old. i use the gas auger when am out on the ice and theres more than 12"" inches of ice. but this is when am not on foot, but traveling around on the atv.. thiking about adapting it to a 18volt cordless drill . but really dont need it now.."
4,A Little Small,Arrived quickly. It's a little smaller than I thought. I would order a size larger than you think you need.
4,psychosonix,"It probably deserves five but everyone gives extreme ratings which undermine the validity of anything anyone says. We've had this for a while and it remains amongst the most favourite albulms we own - and we own lots. I imagine that this is perfect for someone who has tasted a little in the way of mainstream big beat - fat boy slim, chemical bros. etc but want to go a little further and explore a little deeper. Nothing overly challenging but heaps of exciting tracks that have a depth and purpose that makes them extremely durable. Indeed these are tracks you really want to listen to over and over and can do so without fear of becoming bored. To my mind this defines a good album. Go on, buy it..."
1,Who let this [CRUD] out?,Greatest American lyricists since the New Kids. I'd just as soon get my 'nads smacked with a mallet as hear this song once more.
1,not what I expected,The music sounded more like 80's Debbie Gibson instead of year 2000 hip hop/reggae. Not what I expected after hearing Who Let The Dogs Out at a club.
1,Go buy a real reggae CD,For those of you who reggae is just over your head baha man is th eartist for you.Once again perfectly respectly type of music is done in a bubble gum fashion for our now dumbed down country who watches jerry bruckheimer film's cause eany other plot is to complex

2,The Dogs Bite!!!,"After listening to the first song, ""Who Let The Dogs Out"", I immediately got out and bought this CD. The cool lyrics with the catchy chorus just makes ya wanna tap your foot. After listening to ""Who Let The Dogs Out"" a couple of times, i eventually moved onto the rest of the CD. What a disappointment!! The rest of the songs are dull, meaningless and are NOTHING compared to the first track. If you want ""Who Let The Dogs Out"", just by the single version or listen to it on the radio, cause the rest of the CD is not worth it!"
4,Hey Mon...get with the Bahamen,"Only a generation raised on the canned over-produced like of Britney Spears and the like...will tune out this talented Bahamian group. Spend a week in the Bahamas (not just the tourist traps either, the small villages and communities), get a sense of their unique Caribean rhythim and you will hear the Bahamen with new ears. They are very talented, funny, sensual mix of pop, reggae, calypso. Who Let the Dogs Out is actually a song about the strays one sees in Nassau...funny it became a Mets chant...good for the Bahaman and good for those who discover good authentic Caribean music."
5,Now - let's judge them fairly,"BahaMen is the best thing that happened to the Bahamian music scene in a looong time. Reading all the other reviews, I'm either laughing or crying. Yes, they aren't Reggae, they don't mean to be, either. Junkanoo is something typically Bahamian, not Jamaican. If you don't like this type of music, well, that's another thing. I love it, and I loved all their previous albums. Especially ""Island Boy"" was very big in the islands."
1,ALCOHOLICS AND JOCKS REJOICE THIS IS FOR YOU,"What a waste of precious disc space this CD is! Little more than an excuse for drunk men to holler in public - this embarassing piece of trash is the new Macarena (but without the charming dance.) ""Lets take these dogs out!"""
3,IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH....,"Well, i think the c.d. is not very good personally.i think the only good thing about it is ""who let the dogs out"" i have to admit there are a few good party songs but its nothing you would listen more than once or twice at a party. if you listen to the songs besides ""who let the dogs out"" above and you like them, then by all means buy the c.d. maybe its just me and i dont like that kind of music but i like most party songs and i do not like these.so if you liked the little clips of the songs above,buy the c.d. if you dont,i wouldnt recomend it.thanks for reading"
2,"Yes, that's right! Who let the dogs out!?!","I don't know, who it was, who let the dogs out, (haha). I'm really not a big fan of this kind of stupid music, but the song about the dogs...is a very funny song, the music, well...a little, but mostly the lyrics, and the way they're singin it. ""Who, who, who...who let the dogs out..."" haha... , i have heard this ""comedy"" - single on radio and on MTV, but...i have also whatched The Late show Whith David Letterman, and there's a funny guy in that show, who's saying this line loud, ""who who who, who let the dogs out..."" he's keep saying this lines sometimes, on that good program. Well...i'm a guitarmusic-fan, but i love comedy, so this single is one of the more funny singles, in these days, me and a friend to me, is often doing jokes about this lines, in this waco-song"", haha... so buy it you to, and put it in your cd-player, and turn it up to the highest volume, and go nuts! :-) /a musicguy."
2,lock these dogs back up,"boring somebody tell me where these lame fools come from with this (...), too much mainstream appeal look to find these guys on the one hit wonder hall of fame."
1,Horrible...,"Complete garbage. Honestly, the CD tries to be good, but nothing happens. even the biggest fan will think this CD is bad, if they dont they are lying.Please save yourself 13.99 and DONT BUY THIS CD"
1,"No, No , NO","I tried to give these songs a chance but like many before me I have heard better. The one saving grace of the album is ""Who let the dogs out"". This is a good song ,infectious etc. Unfortunately I heard the original soca version 2 years ago. This Baja men version pales by comparison. If you like the song you better off trying to find the original."
1,Baha Men -- Write A Deceny Song!,I got the CD for Who Let The dogs Out? Every other song was terrible.
1,Improper grammar,"I hate to break it to the Baha Men, but the title ""Who let the dogs out"" should be rendered as ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Yo, I gots to bizounce out of this jizoint. Peace, y'all. The sizzle, my nizzle."
2,Who let the Dogs Out....,"CD was like a ""Second""... Songs, stops and skipped. Couldn't use it for what we wanted it for......Everyone in the parade asked why we didn't use it."
1,The reason for only one good song...,"I've heard people saying- Who Let The Dogs Out?- is the only good song. The reason probably is that it's not their song. It's a Trinidadian soca song which they remade exactly. If you like that song, get a real soca cd- like Soca Gold. I'm sure you'll like it much better."
2,It's All Because of the GIANTS!,"Baha Men should bow their head and thank the Giants. Should the San Francisco Giants hasn't been winning, nobody will ever know Baha Men and the hits ""Who Let the Dogs Out"". This song has been the most aired anthem for this season simply because Giants' victory. The song is quite catchy with formulaic melody. The rest of the CD, however, is a pitious production with mere fillers. It might be a perfect CD to play at party yet the ill-fitting mismatched ""You're Mine"" drag down the album with at least 1 star. The ballad ""Where Did I Go Wrong"" shouldn't even be in the album. It is weak. That's another star. The Giants should take the credit for ""Who Let the Dogs Out"", so, another star off."
1,Ba-Ha Men Stink,"Ba-ha men, i het the HA out of it! THe only reason they are singing is to make money, nickelodeon paid them lots of money so they can make up some dumb song that has to do with a animal. WHY DOESNT BA-HA MEN RETIRE? THEY MADE ENOUGH MONEY FROM NICKELODEON, IF ANYONE WANTS TO MAKE MONEY, SING ABOUT A ANIMAL! HOW DOES ""WHO LET THE CATS OUT"" SOUND TO YOU? SOUNDS LIKE A TON OF MONEY TO ME!"
3,This Song Has Gone Thru A MET-amorphosis!,"The SF Giants may want to take intitial credit for making this song popular, but the Mariners played it in Seattle when they beat the White Sox in the Division Series this season!Also, the NY METS played it when they beat the Giants in both games in New York this past week!Woof Woof Woof!"
1,FAKE!!,This song is a direct copy of Anslem Douglas' song. Anslem is an artist from Trinidad and Tobago. It is a very bad remake of it also. These fools didn't even have enough creativity to change it for their own style. I grit my teeth everytime I hear it. The original is better.
2,one song is good,"the only song on this CD thats good is ""who let the dogs out"" and the chorus is the only good part cuz its upbeat. the rest of the CD is stupid. buy the single of who let the dogs out, not the whole CD. its not worth it."
1,Pure Genious - An Opium For The Masses,What rhythm... What beats... This disc is FAT! What can possibly top this musical Mona Lisa? I'll tell you what... Aaron Carter! (Please see my Aaron Carter Review)
1,Put those dogs in the pound! They bite!,This c.d. has nothing to recommend it. The songs are annoying and the title song is really for the birds (or bird dogs). It is a mockery of music.There is no amount of money in the world that is worth wasting on this c.d.
1,THE LOW POINT OF AMERICAN CULTURE,"""Who let the dogs out?"" you may ask.Sadly, just about everyone for a really, really long time. They let them out on the radio, on television, at sporting events, and even in their own homes. They wouldn't stop letting the dogs out no matter how much their consciences complained.Please don't let the dogs out anymore. Please. I'll give you a cute little doggy biscuit and pat you on the head.Thank you for you cooperation."
1,This theme is put to waste,"This is a very catchy phrase, and the music for the song ""who let the dog's out"" during the chorus is nothing other than great. That's why your looking up this cd, right? But don't buy the whole CD for a chorus. even the rest of the song, as I was expecting it to be rap/ hip-hop, (or even christina agulara teeny bopper hyper music) should be good, right? All singing groups have at least one great song. but it's not. it's regge and it dosent match with the chorus, and neither do the lyrics. Who want's to listen to a guy try to sing ""A doggy is nothing if he dosen't have a bowl...A doggy is nothing if he dosen't have a bowl""? That's stupid. Not music. This is either a love it or hate it song, so make sure you know what your in for before you buy."
3,Who cares if this is brilliant....,"You listen to this kind of music to relax, have fun and lighten up a sad mood. Anyway to get to the review, this is just a fun song that everyone (myself included at one point) takes waaaay too seriously. Personally I prefer ""Move It Like This"" or ""Best Years Of Our Lives"" to this one, but this one's fun if you are sad or bored anyway. Junkanoo music is supposed to be fun not serious and that's what you're getting here. If you're looking for serious music, I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
2,pretty much a fad,"who let the dogs out is pretty much a fad just like the macarena. i just saw the video for ""you all dat"" and they sampled ""the lion sleeps tonight"" which proves they are unoriginal and uncool. i probably won't ever go to a sports game again because of the baha men. this will die REAL soon."
1,It reeks,"I heard ""Who let the dogs"" out and every other track on this CD from my brother, and I honestly can vouch that this group has no talent whatsoever and the lyrics sound like something that would have come from one of my mother's junior high students.Actually, I am being very complimentary when I say that, because there are very few nice ways to describe the true nature of this really bad CD. I think I am lucky that my college does not resort to pep rallies, because I have heard from friends that the horrid song is played at their schools to get the crowd warmed up before the game."
1,don't waste your time or money,"One of the worst albums I've ever listened to. The whole thing sounds stale and fake with no originality. Unfortunately, this was my introduction to his material and has put me off buying any of his other albums (although I may pick up some of his early work which is supposed to be excellent)."
2,"Yes go ""SPLAT"" on this one.","This rotten Tormato should have been left to wither on the vine. Limping off into the progressive rock sunset back in '78 - with all those young punk and new wave whippersnappers biting at their heals - Yes stumbled badly on the way to the graveyard. The music on this album is about as shallow and meaningless as the lame Hipgnosis cover art. Gone are the lofty ideals and epic arrangements of the previous album (Going For The One), replaced with insipid lyrics about arriving UFOs and shorter songs that go absolutely nowhere. It would take the band a good 20 years to recapture the old magic on the recently released Keys To Ascension Vol. 2. It's not surprising that this classic lineup broke up after Tormato. Musically, they had reached the end of the road - a dead end. (Actually, there was another album recorded after this one that was so bad, it was never released.)"
3,Not That Bad,"As if to answer the question ""what the hell was Yes doing in 1978?"" along comes Tormato. The splattered tomatoes on the front and back cover are perhaps an indication of how the record company felt about the recording. 'Arriving UFO' may have inspired UFO/comet death cults. 'Circus Of Heaven' is particularly cringeful as it features an overly-dramatic reading by Jon Anderson's son.But it's not all bad. 'Future Times/Rejoice' is an anthemic starting track. 'Onward' is a classic track and should be included on any Greatest Hits compilation. The closing 'On the Silent Wings of Freedom' is also very good. There are 10 bonus tracks (more than doubling the original 8).Yes had a string of bad albums in the late 1970's and early 1980's. But, 90125 and Big Generator eventually redeemed them.[DW]"
2,no,For completists only. They were adapting to punk with shorter songs and found they did not have enough to say for use in short songs. I own it but I never listen to it. Their luck woould change however.
2,One of the worst yes album,"I am a huge yes fan but this one is one of their weakest effort.Hard to believe it has been done just a year after ""Going for the One""""One the silent wings of freedom"" is a good track. The only other good tracks are ""Onward"" (the live version on Keys to ascension is better)and ""Future times-Rejoice""""Don't kill the whale"", ""Madrigal"", ""Arriving UFO"", and ""Circus of heaven"" are horrible.A dark period in the band's history."
3,Tomato,"I have to agree with Wakeman on this one. It is by far the worst album Yes made in the seventies (only surpassed by ""Onion"" a few years later.) Yes has been my favorite band since the early 70's, but I rarely listen to this album. Get this after all the other great 70's Yes albums."
1,Tormato / Yes At best - disjointed,"First in vinyl then CDs, I own The Yes Album, Close to the Edge, Topographic Oceans, etc. This effort seemed far less thought out and structured which yielded a disjointed cacophony just this side of rush hour traffc in in Manhattan. This CD was relegated to my dustbin of music(?)."
3,sissy sounding,I have to almost alternate between songs. It's not an excellent album but a good one.
4,Interesting Yes Album,"I put off buying this album for along time because I had heard so many bad things about it. After hearing it several times now I am definitley on the side of those that like this recording. Even so there are a couple of things that mystify me about Tormato. The first is the actual sound which is not terrible but me thinks it could have been better. I mean these guys were a very successful band that seemed to have already mastered the recording side of things. Well just listen to the previous 6 or 7 recordings. Another thing is that the band almost sounds less mature. If I were told this thing came out 1970-71 I could believe it. Were they trying to be new wavey possibly?? Anyway, these mysteries in my opinion only add to the charm of Tormato. I really like it alot and feel it is a fine album that is a welcome addition to the YES catalogue. It is a bit lighter with shorter songs but the band sounds very inspired and they also sound like they are having alot of fun. Cool Stuff!!"
3,2004 remaster is defective! Wait for the corrected version.,"The hidden track (#18) on this issue has a mastering error which results in several ""ticks"" and skips. Some copies also have this problem with track # 17. I'd wait until Rhino corrects this before buying it."
3,Yes' last gasp,"This is the last of the 70's output for Yes and it is, at best, a mixed big. The cuts Future Times/Rejoice and On the Silent Wings of Freedom are by far the strongest cuts and are equal to anything on Going for the One. The lyrics of Arriving UFO and Don't Kill the Whale are not up to Yes' standards but are musically solid. Madrigal is a strong balad while Onward is not. Release, Release is Yes' response to New Wave and is awful. Circus of Heaven is equally miserable, Wakeman's keyboards on this cut only make matters worse. Throughout, the other musicians perform admirably particularly bassist Chris Squire. So this disc is not essential to your Yes collection but is not without merit...Simon"
5,Yes second best album.,"This album is the most overlooked and underated of all Yes albums , it is my second fav after Going For the One . Long may Tormato and it's positive vibe be cherished and discovered by music lovers. Great tunes abound . Rejoice !"
2,An uneven album,"""Tormato"" found Yes in the middle of a musical crisis. The English press was praising punk and new wave bands, and bands like Yes were called ""dinosaurs"". Maybe because of the new musical climate, Yes abandonned the 15-25 minutes song format and concentrated on shorter songs. But the band was still short on inspiration, as this uneven cd demonstrates. Tracks like ""Release Release"", ""Onward"" and ""On The Silent Wings of Freedom"" are good, but others like ""Circus of Heaven"", ""Future Times"" or ""Madrigal"" are just plain boring. The production is quite dry: one wishes the band had hired a producer instead of doing it themselves. ""Tormato"" is the product of a tired band, going through the motion. It's no surprise Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman left after the tour that followed."
3,Experimental,This CD has a lot of variety on it but I do enjoy listening to most of the songs . I just don't think it's a great CD as a whole . I've heard better by the band but I'm glad it's part of my collection .
1,Are you kidding? This is Yes?,"I don't understand how sandwiched between two of the best albums of all time, The Yes Album and 90125, could be this piece of drech. Horrible. I bought this, suffered through it once, and will NEVER play it again. BAD does not begin to describe this album. And I am a big Yes fan. What the heck happened?"
2,Horrible!,"The only reason this cd gets 1 star more than ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" is because the songs end faster than on ""Tales"" and thus the listener is spared from the agony of having to sit through these atrotious numbers. Songs titles like ""Circus of Heaven"" and ""Arriving UFO"" hint at how bad the contents of this disc really are. The only redeaming music on this cd are the two songs ""Madrigal"" and ""Onward"". Normally these songs would be considered mediocre, but due to the lack of quality on the rest of this album, [...]. As for the rest of the record, they are the reason cd players come with skip buttons."
1,Bore-mato,"This album marks a crossroads.Jon Anderson's ego and new age enlightenment is at it's height.Rick Wakeman's keyboards are at their most annoying.Chris Squire's bass sound is also at it's most annoying.Combine all these and add in the lack of a producer and you get a very annoying album that lacks focus and direction. Even in the Yesterdays documentary Jon Anderson commented on how this album was done without anyone driving the project and everyone was just tired of each other...and it shows.""Onward"" is probably the best song on here, but a much better version of this song can be found on the live ""Keys To Ascension"" cd.Right after this album, Anderson and Wakeman left...probably for the better. I can't imagine what could have come next from this lineup."
4,Not a bad album.,"Not a bad album, the only song I heard off this album was ""Don't Kill the Whale"" so I ordered the extended version of this album with the bonus tracks and it turns out I like this album alot, I had recently bought ""Fly From Here"" and ""Drama"" with the extra tracks and both those albums are also excellent, today I ordered from Amazon the first ""Keys to Ascension"" cd, I have had volume 2 for years...So I am enjoying listening to YES again."
5,These guys have never released a bad album,"Tormato, I haven't heard it since it came out, some years ago. It like every album ever done by Yes is superb. Some people I know will disagree with me, but then I'm a die hard Yes fan. Like every album they have released there is something important for them to say ""Don't Kill the Whales"". Yes does it in their completely mystical, fantasical way. Every note, bar, and riff explodes and gently falls back like snow. I love this album, but then... I LOVE YES!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"The tittle should be ""Collection of Dorky and Pointless Song","One of Yes's patented trademark is to include at least one dorky or pointless song on each album. Examples ; A Venture , Five Percent For Nothing , Holy Lamb , White Car , Turn Of The Century , Take The Water To The Mountain or Open Your Eyes. But never the whole album. ! Best track is "" Onward "" . My guess , they were 4 minutes short and pulled this song out of the archives. I cannot believe the same person (Wakeman) who wrote and played beautiful keyboard pieces of music ( such as Roundabout, You and I and Awake ) would have the nerve to record a piece of garbage as Future Times/Rejoice."
4,"Tormato, Tomato, Portato, Potato","Not one of the best offerings from the band but it still contains enough creative material on it to justify its entry into anyone's audio collection .... I mean c'mon, it's YES!"
1,No,"Man, I love Yes, a lot. But this album really fails to capture the magic of the earlier 70's releases. The only track that stands out to me is ""Circus of Heaven"", its moody and very reminiscent of the ""Fragle"" era. If you're a huge Yes fan, like me, you can live without this album. Buy ""The Ladder"" instead if you want new unheard and good Yes. This CD became one of my various dust gatherers. Oh well, Yes can't be amazing all the time."
1,People who give this album more than one star,"...simply have no ears. I understand that die hard Yes fans will do and say anything for the love of their band, and try to 'sell' Yes to others, but this is just lame. Be honest. If a person who never heard Yes before bought this album on your 5 star reviews, that person would say that Yes is a terrible band and never listen to Yes again. Buy Relayer, and if you have all the other albums, and want to buy Tormato, buy another copy of Relayer before you spend any money om Tormato."
5,Oh Please,"Let's see, Future Times, Don't Kill The Whale, Arriving UFO, Circus of Heavon, Release Release, On the Silent Wings of Freedom. Good Lord listen to the Sound! Seems it is fashionable to bash this album. It is a classic. I don't care what the band says."
3,"Yes, It Is! No, It Isn't!","The inner-turmoil of the band played itself out on this September 1978 release, which found its way into album cut-out bins within a year, though it peaked at #10 on the U.S. album chart.It was the last studio album for a number of years for Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman, with the feuds getting to the point where band members would have individual limousine service while on tour and most dialogue was confined to on-stage banter with the audience.The highlight of the eight numbers is Don't Kill the Whale - which was issued as a single - a hard-edged piece that clicks with Anderson's searing vocal. Included in the bonus tracks is the B-side to the single, Abilene. The majority of the extra material was eventually re-worked for release on other projects.The inclusion of additional tracks nearly doubles the 41:35 running time of the original album. While far from the best the group has to offer, Rhino has done an excellent job in making it an interesting remastered CD."
4,Way Better Than Its Reputation,"Tormato is 'the Yes album which falls outside of the other Yes albums'. A lot of Yes fans consider it the worst Yes album ever. That's a shame. 'Cause Tormato is in fact a(nother) great Yes album, although a little unusual.It is more joyful than most Yes stuff, and the lyrics are more comprehensible/easily-accessible - even in a 'serious' song like Don't Kill The Whale. The album starts out in a great way with the twin tracks Future Times/Rejoice. Jon Anderson's voice comes through very clearly and very happily, and so does the keyboards. In general, the keyboards with its unmistakable late-1970s synth sound are in the foreground on Tormato.Among the more boring tracks are Circus Of Heaven and Arriving UFO. A lot of people have given the latter the title 'worst Yes song ever' - but it really is not that bad!A masterpiece on this underrated album is On The Silent Wings Of Freedom.So - drop your prejudice, stop throwing tomatoes, and go for Tormato!"
4,Tormato is a Refreshing Change From Past Overindulgence,"This recording is a pleasant diversion. If you expect to hear a clone of Close To The Edge or Fragile, you will be disappointed. Who wants to hear the same thing over and over? The songs are shorter, but in their own right have some quality hooks and atmospheric elements. I dig the military drum in ""Future Times"" and Squires Harmonised Rickenbacker throughout. I have been a fan of Yes music for 17 years, but only picked this up 4 years ago, and really enjoy listening to it over and over. Give it it's day in court."
3,A good yes album but not the best,"This by far is not a great Yes album but there is three tracks that stand out. And those are ""Don't Kill the Whale"", ""Madrigal"", and ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"". Those three songs make the album worth buying."
2,Don't kill the cheese,"Often considered a target for rotten produce, Tormato is classic Yes at their most self-indulgent. Still, compared to what has followed, the album isn't *that* dreadful. What drags the album down is Jon Anderson's new agey flights of fancy (what the British call ""twee""), particularly the woeful Circus Of Heaven. Some may also find Rick Wakeman's keyboards to be an exercise in synthesized cheddarHighlights are Future Times/Rejoice, and On The Silent Wings Of Freedom, both of which are fueled by Chris Squire's monumental bass work. Release Release is another uptempo rocker. Don't Kill The Whale also features some fun chord progressions over a driving rock beat, but is marred by some of the cheesiest lyrics this side of a Velveeta commercial.If you are new to Yes, start with the real classics...this one might make you wonder how this band has lasted so long"
3,Yes's Low Point,"Even a bad album by Yes is better by far than a good album by most groups out there, due to the superior musicianship of the members. That being said, if you have experienced the jaw-dropping mastery of Yes in their Fragile to Going for the One years, this album is a significant letdown. The songs Future Times/Rejoice and Onward are pretty good, but not up to the standard that Yes was capable of. The songs Don't Kill the Whale, Release Release, Arriving UFO and Circus of Heaven were the turkeys that dragged it down for me. The only two really Yes-worthy good tunes on the disk are Madrigal and On the Silent Wings of Freedom. I guess it's worth getting if you don't mind hitting the advance button a few times. The later albums Drama and 90125 prove that a change in artistic direction does not have to result in mediocrity; too bad this album didn't rise to that occasion."
2,Origin of 'Tormato',"Just thought I'd respond to 'Prigles ' ref the name Tormato . The rock on the cover is Yes-tor in the middle of Dartmoor ,Devon UK.and is one of many 'tors' in the area The Band were taken up there for the Photo shoot .One of the band -dont know which but sounds like Rick????-apparently thought the idea was silly and threw a tomato againt the photo from which the name/ album cover Tormato was bornNot my favourite Yes album but the 'in the round' revolving stage tour that followed was a great idea"
2,Sorry Moreau...,"...but I'm very much a Yes fan and this album was mediocre...is mediocre...and will always be mediocre...""Keys To Ascension 2"" and ""Magnification"" run rings around this half-baked, alcohol-impaired tripe which the record company rushed out of them to follow up on the (deserved) buzz generated by ""Going For The One"".Sorry, pal...but calling anyone an ""idiot"" for disagreeing with you puts you squarely in that category.TORMATO - NOT RECOMMENDED"
2,Sounds Like A Short-Circuited Video Game,"Not much to recommend here beyond Squire's charged intro in ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" & the nice harmonies of ""Onward."" The next Yes album, ""Drama,"" is much more listenable & inspired."
3,Tormato,The songs are short. Not a good thing for Yes. There is not enough time for them to get into the music. After each song is over you are left hanging wondering what it would be like if it were developed for a longer time.Jan
2,Not a great learning tool,the italian responses are too fast and are only stated once. I was continually hitting rewind. I found the Mark A. Frobose tapes much more helpful.
3,"A great book, but hides in shallow waters","This book, although amusing in sound, lacks the depth and intricacy that normally shows the extremely involved beliefs of both Sartre and Merleau-Ponty."
5,Idiots,"I think it's funny that after reading reviews for this and another book bearing the name Jon Stewart, that they think this is the same Jon Stewart as the one from the Daily Show. Well, lets consider for a moment that Jon Stewart from the Daily show deals with Politics and not Phenomena or Existentialism. If you're looking for the quick satire of the political guru/funnyman, then don't shell out the money to get something that quite obviously isn't from him. Maybe people should follow his cue and start investigating before they believe in something."
1,Very dry,"I picked up this book and was very disappointed--even more disappointed than after watching Death to Smoochy. It lacked all of the wit and satirical insight that Stewart usually brings with both his writing and delivery. Granted, his performance in the movies that he has been in have somewhat failed to bring forth his dynamic humor, but this book failed beyond that of even his movies. Unfortunately, the ending never delivered the cynical turnaround/punchline that I thought he spent most of the book setting up. Honestly, I can't really even enjoy his show any more. Stay away, this book is bad news."
5,A Good thriller that does not drag,This movie is very past faced and Erika is grat in the lading role i just think that fam was pretty stupid for not finding out anything sooner there was a blooer in the movie but otherwise a good time waster
4,WHO IS THAT SINGER?,"Wayne ""the train"" Hancock's 1st album was a real surprise and begged the question, Who is that?"" A real foot tapper and it is easy to think that he was on stage with the 1st Hank. His original work is ""familiar"" but fresh and clever...he is a good writer and his personality comes through as energetic and positive. I loved it at 1st play-through....couldn't wait to find the next album!"
5,One of Wayne's best,"I'm not gonna wax musical intellectual here [like most narcissitic reviewers ;)], but I loved this album; as I do most of Wayne the Train's. The blend of upbeat western swing tracks and slow, bluesy trucker-type tracks make this one of his better albums. Although, as I said, and to mimic the words of Michael ""Mike"" Bolton from IniTech...""I...I guess I sorta like em all,""...."
1,hillbilly hollerin',"This CD got rave reviews, but for the life of my I can't figure out why. Hank comparisons aside, this guy twangs you to death. Overdone, monotonous and down right nerve racking. That's how I'd describe it. If you want a copy, let me send you mine. Oh, I forgot...I donated it to a VFW Hall down in the Texas hill country. Somebody somewhere may love this stuff, but they're circling the drain whoever they are."
2,Concerto Pour Une Voix,I hope Danielle Likari and other authors can bring us the original recording (1970) back! That was a masterpiece. A remake is ok but not even close to THE one. Does anybody have a vinil? Please contact me: graf@earthling.net
1,Original version is the best,I don't like this version. Unfortuntely the original version ('70) is sold out.
5,Baseball history,"I used this book for a baseball history class that compared baseball history, American histry, and their impact on each other. As someone who wasn't a fan of baseball, it was an interesitng read none the less. It allows you to look back in time and see what baseball was like as it continued to change and regulate rules."
5,This is the best baseball history book ever!,I loved this book. It explained the scandal so well that I became an expert in one day.
1,Time to Bury the Black Sox,"Now White Sox is World Series Champions again, it's time to bury the eight men forever from our memories."
5,Eight Men Out - A Must Read,"I have owned this book for several years and read it a while back. I started reading it again, intent on just browsing through some of the highlights. Once I started, it was like reading it for the first time. The writing is so vivid and the story so engrossing that I found myself hoping that the players would not throw the games and later that they would all, especially Buck Weaver (I loved John Cusack in that role) get reinstated back in the game, even though I knew this could not happen.It seems that if Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis had the information that Eliot Asinof had, he would have let all the players back in the game.This is a book I will no doubt read again."
2,"Too Much Jargon, Not Enough Style","The Edge of Honor, written by a retired Navy captain, tries hard to bring the reader into the Navy world and capture the reader's imagination, but doesn't quite succeed. With its stiff prose and bland characters, the novel plods along without building much suspense until two-thirds of the way through, when plot, action, and character finally combine to produce a page-turner. Until that point, however, the military jargon is overwhelming, even with a glossary included at the back of the book. Deutermann's attempt to have the reader learn along with the new guy simply makes the hero look unappealingly naive. A few scenes of life aboard a ship in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam war are extraneous to the plot, do not build character, and are not strong enough in a literary sense to merit inclusion in the book.Retired navy personnel may find this novel an intriguing description of an ultimately dysfunctional ship, but to the outsider it has little to offer."
1,Dissapoinment,tI was looking for a charger for a friends old D1x and this thing appeared and a discount deal with an extra battery from the same brand and this thing is for the camera directly couldnt find anywhere the charger for the battery they sold me.
1,Junk,"I bought this charger for my cell phone, It lasted about a week.I paid $10.00 for it, but when it no longer worked I went to my cell phone carrier store and bought one from them that cost $30.00. So I look at this as a lesson, you get what you pay for, if it is cheaper then it won't last."
3,Good for its Genre,"Jimmy Smith, who was a pioneer in the soul jazz genre, here graduates into jazz-funk. Though I love the Hammond B-3 organ he used throughout his career, he never was quite as much an originator as Grant Green or Stanley Turrentine. Still, his earlier soul jazz outings, especially his collaborations with Wes Montgomery have something to be said for them. Root Down is certainly an enjoyable listen, it does owe its debt to the funk music outside of the jazz world that was now making an impact on it. Though it is less predictable and more catchier than previous recordings, it never breaks the mold of jazz funk. Play it back to back with Miles Davis' ""On the Corner"" and see which comes out a winner."
5,can't beat the bassline!,"Rootdown by the Beastie Boys led me to purchase this album, and boy am I glad I did. Worth the price for the one song alone."
3,Hard n' Slow,"If you like slow paced hard rock like the Def Tones' ""Minerva"" that never actually piacks up when it seems to then get this cd. If that is just not you, then like MOST PEOPLE you will NOT LIKE this cd. I am torn in the middle because I realize why people think music like this is boring and/or sucks but I still kind of like it. ""Lucy"" the song is a great example of all of this. It is all still kind of creepy, but it just doesn't ever blow you away. Nonetheless, a good version of what it is--and very hard to come by--so get it here, baby!"
3,over all a good product,"I only watched the first few episodes but from what I saw, it was pretty good. I assumed that this type of cartoon would appeal more to the kiddos but I took a liking to it as well. Of course, I am stuck in the old days with the older version of He-Man. So, since, as I had mentioned already, I've only seen a few epsiodes, this is pretty much I can say. Hope this review is of some help."
3,No more replacements,"I loved this update of the classic series, however for those who buy this in 2009 or later, there are no more replacement discs mentioned in some of the reviews below, so we are out of luck. I know because I tried to get one and the phone number is disconnected and the email listed just sends an automated response saying call the number--and the BCI GUY mentioned above was on a He-man website and said that BCI is going out of business. So no replacements. Supposedly you can buy an ""Orko Approved"" version that has the full episode, but the one I bought here on Amazon wasn't one of them. I was really into that episode too. Anybody got a replacement disc to sell? Or know which stores sell ""Orko Approved"" versions?"
2,Episode Error?,"One thing I have noticed is in the episode ""Courage of Adam"" on Disc 1, at about the 15 min mark there seems to be an entire section the episode missing.The episode shows Cringer trying to give Adam, who was imprisoned, his sword back then he gets chanced away, and the episode fades away and the next scene shows the Masters and Adam outside and free. It never showed the Master's arriving and Adam escaping. At first I thought it to be from another episode but Cringer was still wearing the harness to carry Adam's sword.I am not sure if this was an editing error or a bad copy on a disc. For now I am throwing it up to an editing error, hence the reason for the low score. They should have put more car into making sure everything gets on the disc.Besides the little issue with that episode, this series I enjoy, and I like it a lot.**EDITED TO CORRECT A TYPO, I meant to say section (read the comment) but I said second."
1,Disappointed,"Not good. Model in a bottle much, much better and for less money. Did not sustain through heat & sweat. Not reliable. I love this line, so I purchased on faith. This just didn't work for me...but I highly recommend Paula Dorf makeup."
4,My thoughts,"Make sure you have the Fireworks MX software loaded on a PC and do the chapter exercises while reading the material. Else this book will put you to sleep. I found the end of chapter exercises to be a bit vague. If the book had more chapter examples, some enthusiasm and the end of chapter exercises were not ambiguous, I would have given this book a rating of five.Nonetheless, the book has a lot of useful information thus making it a handy Fireworks MX resource."
2,2 CLASSICS 14 THROWAWAYS,Dont BUY this ALBUM (lol) BUY SONGS #2 & #5 individually if you wanna be LEGIT & SUPPORT but DR. DRE got enough MONEY & been BULLS/H/I/T/T/I/N/G 4 TOO LONG on DETOX so find a FREE DOWNLOAD for those 2 song ONLINE (lol)
3,been there done that,this could have been a classic if dre would have let his artists do that hardcore stuff even if he did'nt wanna do gangster rap anymore himself dre should have stuck with his p funk roots and this would have been a instant classic I always liked the first chronic better.
1,This CD is TERRIBLE,"This is one of the worst CD's I have ever bought. I took it back after a week. They told me that I couldn't get a refund so I left sitting on the counter in the store, it is that bad!!!"
2,Dr. Dre The Aftermath,The seller did a great job nothing bad to say about that.. I was looking for the new Aftermath CD that was supposed to be released on 4/20 but couldnt find it in stores so I ordered what I thought was it on hereThis CD sucks.. Dr. Dre doesnt even do much vocals and the beats and sound in general doesnt sound like what I expected from such a great artistAdam
5,Dre's worst CD... But still better than any others,"Any fan of Dr. Dre will have to admit that this CD is sub-par compared to all his others. Regardless of that, this CD is STILL better than most other gangsta albums out there. Dre's Aftermath staff can not be [Messed] with. No matter what anyone else says, Dre has the tightest beats in the game. Pick any year since 1985 and his beats and production have been on the top of the charts. This was his first CD since he formed his own record label, Aftermath Entertainment. The songs are mostly previews of what was yet to come from Aftermath. The best songs on this CD are ""East/West Coast Killas"" and ""Been There, Done That."" If you are a fan of Dre, and want to see how he revolutionized rap (...again) then this a must-have."
4,dope,"this is a fairly good album by Dr. Dre's company Aftermath, and there are some excellent songs on here. an obvious standout would be East Coast/West Coast Killaz by Nas, KRS-One, B-Real & RBX. other good songs are Been There Done That by Dre, Sh*ttin On The World by Mel Man, and the less popular songs, King T's absolutely amazing Str-8 Gone & Sharief's song L.A.W, which may be the best song on the album. RC's cover of the song Fame is good and King T's verse is excellent. However, the rest of the album is simply cliche'd R&B and a disspointing song by RBX. Buy it, it's not that bad!"
2,"So Poor, So Bad...","I bought this album simply because I owned The Chronic and 2001 and I loved them both... But this.. Well, this can't be considered a Dr. Dre CD.First of all, just one of the sixteen songs in this CD is Dre's. So Dre is presenting something (his label), but it doesn't mean he's presenting himself, if you know what I mean.This album has a lot of gangsta raps like Been There Done That (by Dr, Dre), but also ""soul"" raps (calm raps) like Choices (by Kim Summerson).But what you must really be asking yourself is: is this CD worth my money? The answer is no, unless you're a total hardcore Dre fan and you want to own every CD with his name on it. Well, because, in my opinion, he's just a mere guest in this CD.So if you're looking for a good Dr. Dre CD, look elsewhere for The Chronic or 2001. If you're looking for quality rap, look elsewhere too."
2,I like his other cds better,"I really like Dr. Dre, and I love ""The Chronic"" and ""Chronic 2001"" but I was dissapointed with this album. I didn't like any of the songs. Maybe it was because they were by other people, not Dre. My advice is to buy 2001 instead, that is my favorite cd!"
3,"The Aftermath, After Death Row","Dr. Dre's first release after leaving Death Row with this compilation of heavy hitters and newcoming artists. With ""Aftermath (The Intro)"" strarting off this lp it seemed to be headed for a five star classic. ""East Coast/West Coast Killas"" by Group Therapy consists of four emcees / rappers of killing lyrics of RBX, Krs-One, B-Real & Nas. Mel-Man drops mediocre lyrics over the heavy bassline and hard kicks on ""Sh**tin' On The World"". RBX bats again on the solo ""Blunt Time"" as he continues to deliver the hard lyrics as done on The Chronic. Newcomer R&B diva, Kim Summerson delivers an impressive performance on ""Choices"". Dre has a song of his own, ""Been There Done That"", as he compares himself to other rappers / emcees and producers. The highlight of this release is production!"
3,Murder vs The Aftermath,"The first 5 tracks are the best on the album. The last track which is a cover of the old David Bowie song ""Fame"" is quite funky with a Hip-hop/ R&B twist to it. Dre has tried to match or surpass his efforts on the ""Murder Was The Case"" Soundtrack, but doesnt quite get there, mainly because there isnt enuff funky hip-hop to nod your head to, Unlike Murder.. Overall not a bad CD but would like to see Dre, Snoop and Mel-Man hook up for a ""Murder Was The Case Part 2"""
1,crap,cd did not have any type of case it came in a enevlope it was very scratched and broken completely in half. never buy from this person ever. crap
1,AFTERMATH OF A HORRIBLE CD!!!,This is dr dre's worst album ever.It seems it was rushed and made in a day.All the songs are boring and the production sucks.I will try and forget that dre ever made this cd.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
3,Ethnographic Fiction,"A realistic, nearly panoramic, ethnographic fiction of Nigerian culture. It is at once historical (abundant local slang and explanatory passages about local customs) and fictional (sufficiently exotic imaginaries of both London and Lagos, from opposing perspectives). Overall, an enjoyable read, but the obsessive ethnographic details wear it down."
2,Very disappointing sequel..,"After reading the masterfully done ""Things Fall Apart"", I then read the sequel ""No Longer at Ease"", and found myself cursing at the author for producing such an unworthy sequel. The novel follows the grandson of the chiefian in ""Things Fall Apart"". The grandson is an honorable man, who tries to break away from the corruption that is all around him, and tries to overcome the old dead customs that prevent him from finding true happiness. But he finds that he isn't strong enough to overcome the past, and his people. He falls into weakness, and he is punished for it. We are left shaking our heads at how it all went wrong, and we also feel ripped off by the protagonist's ultimate weakness."
4,"not as good as things fall apart, but worth the read...","another painful book, a book about transition.pluses: (1) i could relate to the transitions; (2) i could relate to the temptations to cheat and lie; (3)i could relate to wanting to be a hero for ""my tribe""; (4)a book about a wildly different culture from my own...that in many ways isn't really so different; (5)it's a sequel to ""things fall apart"", so the beloved characters (or their descendants) from that book LIVE ON!minusus: (1) not the most dynamic story; (2) not particularly emotionally or spiritually redeeming"
1,Worst Book I have ever read.,Well I read this book and it was utterly stupid. I do not recommend this book to anyone except a person that cannot go to sleep. If you have questions mail me at Dark_987@hotmail.com.
5,Masterpiece story telling,"A classic African story delivered in style, every time I read the story of Okonkwo's grandson it reminds me that things really never novel."
5,"No longer at are, Chinua Akebe",Customs and cultural mores of African villages disrupted by Christian missionaries in their zeal to 'enlighten the natives' is difficult reading. With attention one can keep track of the unfamiliar names with consonant rich spelling. It is worthwhile reading in appreciating the seemingly endless cycle with which civilizations are refashioned to supposedly higher levels of beliefs and traditions.
4,Good Choice,"The book provides and efficient way to find correct conjugations for most verbs. The information provided on page 249 ""The Structure of the Verb"" could use some clarification. It does not give you a complete understanding of the information in the shaded area at the top of each conjugation table. A native speaker is needed to make sense of it.Overall I recommend the book.[[ASIN:9653760106 Hebrew Verb Tables)"
5,"No more problems with verbs, the very actual problem of Hebrew!","Conjugations, active, passive verbs, and all the ""buildings"" are real pain and suffering for those, who study Hebrew : simple and harmonious language in its concrete brevity.Tarmon and colleague were able to provide a simple and necessary tool to overcome normal insecurities whosoever shall speak an other language than his/her mother tongue.Simple, easy to use, intuitive and applicable ! It's an excellent text for those who want to minimize errors by talking and above all by writing biblical and modern Hebrew.Filippo Zizzo"
5,Hebrew verbs,"Arived very quickly, almost by rocket mail Was as described, Am very pleased. Expect the book to be very very helpful. Expected it to be Biblical Hebrew not Modern Hebrew. Kudos"
4,Short but informative,"David Wetzel writes a concise essay on the events which brought about the Franco-Prussian War. The question of succession of the Spanish Throne turned into the events which start a domino effect which would not end until 1945.Wetzel examines the major players and how their activities brought about the war, specifically Bismarck, Kaiser Wilhelm and Napoleon III. Wetzel is evenhanded in his analysis of the events of the events, but fails to delve very deep into the factors which caused the conflict. A more in-depth work would provide a better understanding for readers. Despite the brevity, Wetzel produces a well written work which explains why the Franco-Prussian War occurred."
4,A fine book to understand the origins of the war,Does a fine job explaining how the war happened. Recommend it to anyone curious about the issue.
1,Plagiarism,"The author of this volume has lifted, almost verbatim, passages from Edward Crankshaw's biography of Otto von Bismarck. Not only does the author utilize these passages without attribution, he also does not cite Crankshaw in his bibliography.This petty thievery is unfortunate, since this book does give an in-depth and quite interesting account of the diplomatic machinations that led up to the war of 1870."
2,Shipped too early,"I found the graphics primitive and character movement way too slow.I have a medium to high-end gaming machine and Ididn't bother to complete the first level. Graphics might be OK for you, but I think they shipped this game way too early."
1,A travesty,"This is the worst game I have EVER been silly enough to buy. Buggy, senseless, and more laughable than scary. I can't believe that so many good games are scrapped whilst this one made it to a (obviously premature) launch. This game spoils the memory of a great film. Worst still, there are unlikely to be more games made based on Dusk Till Dawn because this is so horrible :("
4,Nice addition for homeschooling,"It is a little above my 6 year olds level, but I know when we study these figuares later we will be using this ebook a lot. I read bits and peices to my husban now and we are learning a lot."
1,Not one of Mel's best efforts,I consider myself somewhat of a Mel Torme expert. I had all of his LP's and now all of his CDs'. I have seen him live 3 times and he was incredible. His best efforts are his numerous collaborations with the great George Shearing and with the Marty Paich dektette. You can't go wrong with almost any of his Concord recordings even though they were done late in his career. He was at his best when he didn't have to shout over an orchestra. The Marty Paich dektette and George Shearing's piano and a bass were perfect accompanists. These London sessions from the 60's have been released in various permutations are not his best. Stick to his live concerts where he really shines.
5,NWO!!!,"awesome dvd, just sad its not longer and more in detail, but it is what it is. and yes, its worth the money."
5,Never thought Hogan would have a new look,"I havnt bought the dvd set yet but seen some of the fights and were great. Especially the one where Hogan turns heel. I have to ask, but does anyone know if the match from Feb. 2nd, 2000 between Hogan Vs. Lex Lugar/Ric Flair is on this set? Its also when Miss Elizabeth, Formly Macho Man's manager tried to hit Hogan over the head with a baseball bat."
4,Very short,"I own this disc. I am a huge nwo fan and basically this disc only goes as far as the nwo capturing the title in wcw and goes straight to the wwf. this should have been at least a two disc set. it's almost like vince just put it out but really didnt put any effort into it. hell, the new dx got a three disc set and that was just a span of a few months. the nwo deserved a better release than this disc. but it was cool to see a lot of this stuff so i would give three and a half stars. the nwo has too much history to be put on just one disc."
3,Not bad...why so expensive?,"If you were there during the heyday of the nWo, you might find yourself feeling like there's something lacking here. It seems like a lot of the WWE's treatments of former WCW storylines and wrestlers seems superficial, except for the excellent ""Four Horsemen"" set. Anyway I bought this for 5.50 at Wal-mart about six months ago, is it out of print or something?"
3,nWo Deserves Better,"The nWo revolutionized pro wrestling. They were the only reason to watch WCW for the longest time. Unfortunately, the WWE decided to make them a big joke. This DVD is great when they go through the beginning of the New World Order. From the invasion of Hall & Nash to the transformation of Hollywood Hulk Hogan. For whatever reason however, the WWE only focused half of the DVD on the real nWo. The other half highlighted the watered down stint that the nWo was forced through with the WWE in early 2002. The best thing about the DVD are the extras. Loaded with key matches from the nWo's history and their return match for the WWE. Plus, two nWo promos are included from their highly anticipated return to the WWE in February 2002. This DVD will only interest hardcore nWo fans, as long as you didn't mind the way that the WWE bumbled the most anticipated return of any wrestling group in WWE history."
4,Christmas present,The item came in time for a Christmas present and made my son a happy camper because he really likes wrestling
4,Not the best but still good,This DvD is a very good biography of the original 3 members of the nWo. It could've been alot better if they had shown the nWo Wolfpac and their many fueds. But overall good.
3,A Pretty Good DVD,"I was pretty satisfied with this DVD for the most part. However, for a DVD that was supposed to chronicle the history of the nWo, it kinda came up short in the ""history"" department. The very beginnings of the group were covered in great detail, however, the coverage of the WCW ""era"" of the nWo ended after The Giant joined up with the group in 1996. What about the next 4 years?? Hogan's loss to Sting at Starrcade 97....the split into 2 factions? nWo 2000?? Unfortunately, these and other historically important highlights were left off in favor of coverage of the nWo's return to the WWF. The bonus matches that were included, however, made up for the lack of history in part. Overall, not such a bad DVD, but if you're looking for the *FULL* history of the nWo, this just doesn't cut it."
5,A must have for nWo fan,"The nWo may be suffering a slow death at the hands of WWE writers but this DVD brings you back to the glory days when the nWo was running wild and kicking serious ass. The DVD focuses on the early part of the nWo as most of it was from 1996 to early 1997. Thankfully it doesnt discuss in detail the run offs like black and silver. There are great interviews with Nash, Hall and Hogan in which they discuss things like the Kliq and why they left wwf in the first place. There are also 4 full length machtes included:BASH AT THE BEACH 1996: Hall & Nash vs. Sting, Luger, SavageFALL BRAWL 1996: Wargames: Hall, Nash, Hogan, Fake Sting vs. Sting, Luger, Arn, FlairSTARRCADE 1998: Kevin Nash vs. GoldbergRAW: 3/11/02: Rock and Austin vs. nWoThis is 20 something bucks you will well spend. I hope the WWE also releases a four horseman tape set."
3,A DISSAPPOINTMENT!,"I was expecting so much more from this DVD. The main problem: Why does half of this DVD take place since their WWF debut(only about 3 months), when they were terrorizing WCW for four years? Now I understand that it can be more fun going to the dentist than watching WCW, but the NWO segments were always very compelling. This DVD fails to really capture the essence of what the NWO was all about and just how big an impact they had on wrestling. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad DVD and I don't regret buying it, but if you're looking for a really great DVD about a wrestler's history you should buy TRIPLE H; The Game or HULK Still Rules instead.If you have an extra 20 bucks lying around, then buy it. If you don't expect too much, you just might enjoy it."
2,The nWo Empire Has Fallen,"When i heard this DVD was being released i was watering at the mouth.Being a wrestling fan in the UK means u get loads of WWE and very little WCW (R.I.P) OR ECW (R.I.P.Not that is a bad thing espically during 1998 and 1999 when the wwe was at it's creative best.But u got very little WCW..u got Nitro and Thunder but that was it no P-P-V'S or Videos.So we didn't get 2 c very much of the best of the best creative angle in history.So when i heard the wwe was releasinga nWo dvd i was excited as soon as i plyed it i was left short....i was hopeing 4 a detailed account from Bash At The Beach 1996 all the way 2 The new nWo 2000 faction (jarret,hart,nash,hall etc) but all i got was 1996 thats it,instead they skipped 2 the feble wwe nWo.Very dissapointed!!!!!!!!!!!1"
4,My review,My review on Erick Sermon Insomnia was it was a pretty good album.If you are a real hip hop head then this is the album for you.
5,excellent,I think this a excellent combination of music and i really love it. I'm looking forward to getting the other cd's that are available.
4,Nice tool!,"I got this to replace a versapack cordless drill which was never anything to write home about after the motor died. This thing is great. I've had this one about a year and it has lots of nice features that really come in handy (such as a light that comes on when you've got it level, adjustable torque, and a feature where you can leave the screw driver bit in and use an outside attachment for the drill bit making switching back and forth really easy). It is a little on the heavy side so if you are only doing light handyman jobs, you might consider the 12 volt which is a bit lighter. Oh, and the batteries last forever!! I bought the drill alone so I don't know about the studfinder."
4,4-1/2 stars really,"I know ""real"" DIYers might scoff at B&D;, but I'm totally satisfied with this drill. The 18v has a lot of oomph for everything but the toughest screws, which usually are difficult to hand-screw so I understand a power screwdriver wouldn't have the torque.I've had it over a month and it's still going strong - granted, I don't use it everyday, but it's held its charge for longer than I would have expected and longer than what I experienced with a Ryobi 14.4v driver.Overall - I'd give this 4-1/2 stars and highly recommend it for it's useful charge time, powerful torque, and pricepoint."
5,A great drill for the money,"As an occasional home user, this drill has worked great for hanging blinds, fixing door hinges, assembling IKEA furniture using a hex bit, etc.It probably isn't robust enough for someone using a drill as part of their job, but it's a great tool for occasional projects around the home."
2,"OK for the money, far from perfect","I've used this drill for a few years, about once a month. A fully charged battery doesn't last long about 30-40 min of work. It doesn't have enough juice to be used as a drill and the battery will last about 10 min. Finally, last weekend while assembling furniture from IKEA, sparks and smoke began coming out from back of the drill. I would not recommend buying this drill to anyone, invest into more respectable brands (Dewalt, Makita, Panasonic).The stud finder is working, definitely it's not a pro grade by any means. It takes some time to get used to it, you have to recheck 2-3 times to make sure it sees the stud correctly."
3,Doesn't spin true. wobbles,"Well, For a basic cordless drill it is nice in that it charges fast, light weight and easy to use. However, the one I received does not spin true so driving a long screw will be a bit harder than normal.It has handy features in that it has hex and flat head tips that fit on the back top of the drill so you always have them with you. It also has a bit for holding these tips that also is held on the base. If it wasn't for the wobbling I would rank it a 4.For the money I have gotten better at Lowes so that's why not a 5.Haven't used the stud finder yet but that was a nice addition.I won't return it but won't buy the same model next time I need one.Hope this helps."
3,Black & Decker CD18SFRK 18-Volt Cordless Drill Kit,For a Black and decker it's ok for the Homeowner projects.If your planning on doing anything like building a deck etc. buy a real tool.
2,RACIST,"I love Martin Lawrence movies such as ""Blue Streak"" and ""Nothing To Lose"" but this one was poor. The one thing that was most annoying was the amount of racist jokes in it - it made Martin look like an arrogant racist schmuk! Almost everything he said in the movie had some sort of racist involvement and after a while it gets annoying and frustrating. Probably the reason why the movie was a box office dud!"
1,Racism is unacceptable in ANY form!,"Although this movie had it's funny points, it was unfortunately a deplorable festival of racism. If a movie was made taking such a high degree of ill opportunity at any other race, it would be deemed unfit and would have been banned and labeled as the biggest injustice in the movie business. Well, it is. This is the very garbage that continues to perpetuate racism in America. This is an utter disgrace. Shame on you Martin Lawrence and shame on you Hollywood for making a film so insensitive and hateful. If you are even remotely fair of mind, DO NOT buy or rent this film."
3,GET A GRIP PEOPLE!!!,"As a white guy, I was not the least bit offended by this movie. I think most people out there simply didn't get it. Martin Lawrence was PURPOSELY playing a character who was over the top in his suspicion of white people, especially cops.I don't understand why so many people are put off. Lawrence was hardly subtle in playing a black Rodney-Kingesque character who then has to team up with the white cop who allegedly abused him.And Lawrence's character is put in his place later in the film when he finds that the Steve Zahn character has a black girlfriend. I admit that this was a little heavy-handed, but that's how this movie goes.That said..it was not a great movie. it was very predictable in plot. I knew right away who the bad guys would turn out to be, and pretty much how the story would unfold.There were some funny moments, but this was pretty standard ""odd-couple"" action comedy ala Lethal Weapon and Rush Hour, but not nearly as good as those movies."
1,Don't waist your time....,"Please, whatever you do, do not waist your time thinking about renting or buying this movie. I once was a HUGE fan of Martin Lawrence, but when I sat down and watched ""National Security"", I vowed to myself never to watch another one of his movies again.The constant barrage of racially charged comments aimed at white folks that spew from his pie-hole thoroughly disgusted & enraged me. I walked out 25 minutes into the movie. The basic story of the movie was a good one, but he (Lawrence) just ruined it by being in it. Every step of the way, Lawrence's character is backstabbing this white cop, (who's problems started by meeting Lawrence's character) who is just trying to make it through his difficulties and find the guys who killed his former partner.I am ashamed to be of the same race as Martin Lawrence."
2,Mediocrity All Around,"National Security is quite a disappointment when expecting a hilarious comedy.In short, the acting and the plot are average, while the humor and the dialogues are slightly below average.Moreover, the characters are weak, bland and just plain uninteresting, not to mention that to call the ending ""predictable"" is the understatement of the year!In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.No masterpiece here... 2 Stars"
5,National Security - Funny,Any movie with Martin Lawrence has got to be funny. And this was another one of those movies. I really enjoyed it.
3,National Security,"As usual Martin Lawrence also manages to have humor in his movies. This movie was funny, however, not what would really happen in reality. It was a ok."
1,Another Lawrence Bomb,"Looking for a dumb movie with a lot of dumb and a side helping of dumb, look no further. A sad offering from Mr. Lawrence, an actor/comedian who has done so much better."
3,what the problem is?,"funny as hell all the way through, though is lags in some of the action parts and Eric Roberts seems like a dumb blonde with his blonde hair. my favortie part is when Zahn and Lawrence meet and then that damn bumblebee comes along and it looks like on a camera that Zahn is beating Lawrence up and he goes to jail. Zahn and Lawrence both have great one linersfavorite lineMartin Lawrence- Ma'am, you can repracure your vehicle(then it blows up and he turns to her and says) what the problem is?"
4,Pretty good.,"This is about a guy( Martin Lawrence), who accuses a cop( Steve Zahn) of beating him, so he can get on the police force, whn really he was just beating a bee that Martin Lawrences charactar was afraid of. So he goes to prison for 6 months, than they reunite, and have to stick together to take down some criminals. Good Film!"
2,An action excuse to racism,"I was really amazed with the attitude of the character played by Martin Lawrence. It was absolutely racist to the point that the Lawrence character send an innocent cop to jail and that is supposed to be funny. His obsession about being black is showed during most of the scenes with special stress on his lack-of-brilliant conclusion to the white cop when he tells him that ""being innocent in jail + your girlfriend dumped you + an underpaid job after that"" means you're a black guy. Basically the simple action plot was just an excuse to portrait was the movie is about: A different version of racism, promoted by the black not-funny main character.Maybe I am not the target audience of this movie!. At least it was a rental"
1,RACE RACE RACE RACE RACE,"I haven't heard so many racial jokes since the Rodney King incident. Actually, there were last jokes when that happened. A movie to forget and wait for the next Martin Lawerence film."
2,Don't waste your money,I rented this video with a gift card and I now regret it; I usually like Martin Lawrence but this movie was terrible. I should have rented something else. Is it a comedy? action flick? It fails on both. There was no chemisty between the actors and the writing was terrible.
1,Just Awful,Martin what were you thinking?? Didnt you learn anything from Black Knight?? I didn't laugh once watching this movie. A waste of Martin's great talent
2,Not as good as I expected.,"This is your typical comedy in a can movie. The script isn't all the original and the story line isn't all that gripping either.It's the usual story of two miss-matched people coming together to accomplish a 'mission'. The characters are opposites of each other, Lawrence plays the usual loud, obnoxious black guy while Zahn plays a former cop who just lost his partner. Zahn's character loses his job as a cop after being accused of beating up Lawrence but both characters come together and inevitably become best buddies in the end. It's not the best Lawrence movie out there and when you compare it to some of his best (bad boys, blue streak) it downright disappointing.The movie did make me laugh in some parts but overall I found it to be a slow starting, not very well planned movie.2 Stars"
4,Funny Rush Hour-type movie,"I found many similarities between NATIONAL SECURITY and the extremely hilarious RUSH HOUR series. They are both very much alike. Lawrence and Zahn both do great acting jobs, which helps the film alot. The laughs keep on coming and so does the action. But, for some reason, I liked it a little better when I saw it in the theater a few months ago. It's still very good though."
5,Hilarious comedy and great action.,"I thought that this was great. I didn't think it was rasist at all (I'm not black, but srtongly apposed to rasicm.). I thought that it was very funny. I saw alot of reveiws saying that it was stero tyipcal, but of whites too so everyone was stero typed. It was a great film and it had some great action scenes although over all it was a comedy."
1,Racial,"This movie really deserves a ""0"" star, it is Martin Lawrence's worst movie yet. The movie is racial from beginning to end and I sure don't recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Martin Lawrence's because it will leave you shaking your head in disgust."
2,Another zanie pic from Martin Lawrence,"I only have to look at his face to start laughing. I think they overdid the racist gags in this film but Martin Lawrence and Steve Zahn did a great job of acting out this crazy plot. Lots of explosions and shoot-outs. Quite fun really. I think the scene I shall remember most is the dual-control, driving school car that they hi-jacked and then couldn't agree on which way to go. That had me in fits. Good entertainment to see once or twice. Not for the library."
1,Typical Martin lawrence,"This movie is completely typical of Martin Lawrence's racial views, and is just like every other movie he's in. Completely racist against everyone who is not black. Besides that the movie was still completely predictable, low budget acting, and poor dialogue. It obviously must have been written by martin lawrence himself."
1,If you're not sophisticated enough for knock-knock jokes...,"This is the ideal movie for those with frontal lobotomies.If you think that a person being beaten, sent to jail and losing his wife--solely on account of his race--is really funny, you'll love this film. This ""comedy"" has all the fun of watching one's mother die.Other than studio shills and imbeciles, who could like this atrocity? If there were no explosions, car chases and people being killed and maimed by Uzi-type firearms, in a blood splattered contagion of hilarious death and dismemberment, would even the drooling cretins who bring their young children to this kind of racist, violent, filthy ""entertainment?"" pay money to see it? Is ""professional"" wrestling too tame for them?I saw it on TV--Cinemax, so it was sorta free; but I still felt cheated. I can't imagine the ""director"" of this garbage laying down a commentary tract...has he no shame? taste? conscience?The more people I know, the more I like my dog."
5,Hilarious!,"This is a movie that really deserves a big award. Its hilarious at many points and never gets boring. The shootout scenes are very fun to watch. The part where they are hiding on the back of the truck and are on the bridge, something goes terribly wrong, and is, in my opinion, the most hilarious part on the movie.Get the dvd or vhs, it's worth every penny.P.S. You guys who are mad at Martin Lawrence for saying bad things about white people, it's not his fault, the writer wrote those awful remarks, Martin just had to say them because they are in the script.P.S.S. I am white."
1,Never Mind the Racism. This Movie Was Just Stupid!,"I am glad that I saw this movie for free if I had to pay to see it I would've been very disappointed. As is I wasted time sitting through it so there was a price to pay. I've never seen Martin Lawrence in such a terrible stereotyped role. Of course there are people claiming that Martin is racist after watching this movie, I'm at least smart enough to know that Martin was playing a character, a very overthetop and throughly unlikable character at that. The issue of race shouldn't have been thrown in the face of the audience the characters were throughly unbelievable. This movie is waste of time to watch."
1,20 Purple Tulips,The flowers weren't secure in the box. They wilted within 24 hours of receipt. Very disappointed.
2,Warmed-over Solzhenitsyn,"This is just a rehash of the Gulag Archipelago, with a few new bits of information that have come since Solzhenitsyn published his great work. Applebaum even borrows the structure of her book from Solzhenitsyn.And somehow, she manages to make the subject boring. It's a really lackluster, half-baked stab at a monumental subject."
2,disappointed...,"i read the rave reviews and i bought this book as a result. if you want to know every detail about the gulags, buy this book. if not, don't. too much detail for me. the first third was interesting but found that i could not keep going. writing style too flat; this is more like a dissertation."
5,#1 Text for Gulag History,"This book is essential reading for anyone who is interested in Russia's violent history starting in 1918 when the first ""camps"" were erected and through the Stalinist purges until their dismemberment in the 1950s. The author goes into great detail what it was like to live under Stalin's paranoid regime and the fact that no one was immune from the deadly knock on the door in the middle of night. It portrays what life was like in the Gulags and that practically every family in the Soviet Union was affected by this tragic period in Russian history. The magnitude and the methods of these terrible purges almost makes the Holocaust pale in comparison. This work will be used in the years ahead as a vital reference to historians."
4,Insightful and well documented history about an aspect of the Soviet Union,"We probably all think we know something about the Gulags, but Applebaum puts it in the context if each period. The development and endurance of the gulag system is remarkable and breath-taking."
5,A superb work,"As someone who has spent plenty of time studying the Soviet Union, this has to be considered one of the best on the subject to come out in some time. Not only does the book include a great amount of detail, the author helps us make sense of it and puts it in perspective. Highly recommended."
5,"Great but, of course, Sad Book","Very briefly, this book does a very good job of covering the entire history of the old gulag (a new one is on the horizon, with the resurrection of Putin-lead Soviet Russia) without being overbearing in the amount of material presented. The coverage of such topics as Americans in the Gulag and the very large Ukrainian presence in the Gulag is excellent."
5,The NEW STANDARD,"Thsi work details all aspects of camp life. It speaks of the many projects understaken, like the White Sea Canal. it speaks of the many peoples that were deported into the camps. It shows how they exists for all manners of prisoners and how diverse the structure. The author examines the guards and the resistance. She examines the foriegners(Americans, Spanish was veterans, poles, spies, germans and many others) who came to live in the cmaps and their relations with the russians. This is an amazing book, but has a lack of maps and statistical data."
5,Russia's Big Secret,"The Russian gulags make the German Holocaust look almost like a tea party. Russians from all walks of life were arrested at random on bogus charges to be cattled into the gulag system which in turn provided millions of men, women and children for slave labor. The Russian economy took into account how many prisoners there were available. If there was a shortage, more were merely arrested. There were more ""reasons"" for arresting someone than for not arresting them. This provided the logic behind the whole system. For example, a group of brothers were arrested for winning a soccer match because they defeated the favorite team of the NKVD (a.k.a. KGB) leader. Prisoners were tortured (for false confessions), beaten, starved, frozen, raped, mutilated, traded, and deprived of humanity. Being killed or dying was the least of one's problems. This truly is one of Russia's biggest historical secrets."
4,Why,"The question for me in such tragedies of mass murder or forced labor or the inhumane way man treats man is ""why"". I think that Ms. Applebaum comes the closest to explaining the why of the Gulag as anyone else has. She is honest about the shortcomings of some of the information from memoirists and from USSR documents but continues on in order to make sense of the whole tragedy. I am not any happier knowing what happened, I am more frightened actually that it will happen again and that so many don't even know that the Gulag happened at all."
4,I did not receive my next day shipment as promised (the next day).,"Thanks for asking, but I do not wish to comment beyond the ratings given above. All the books were in good condition, as promised."
5,Excellent Research Work,"Based on extensive research on prisoner's reports and archives from the Gulags. It's very important to show the horrors of the Communist State, people need to know that the crimes of Stalin was at least so terrible as Hitler."
2,Not all that,The book is very basic thoughts and not very deep and the poems read like sing song rhymsthat i learned in 11th grade in englisg class. I did not get thehype the other 3 wrote. Maybe they were friends of the author. I was worth 2 stars because it was a good effort and the idea may be good for some not many people.
3,"not bad, but a little long-winded","Melissa Nathan's characters are developed and I could relate to them. I like the character of Katie and her interactions with her friends (i.e. Suki), coworkers (Matt), family, love interests (Dan) and non-love-but-love-interests (Hugh) -- the storylines were believable and fun.The only beef I had was had it went on for quite a while and I started to think, get to the point! She covers not just Katie, but all of the people in Katie's life, in detail."
4,"Easy to use, quick knowledge growth, great tastes","<a href=""http://www.breworganic.com/Coffee/Coffee_roasters.htm"">The Gene Cafe rotating drum roaster</a> was very easy to use right out of the box. I was able to run two different batches of roasting within an hour. This allowed a side by side comparison of a light roast and full city roast using the same bean. The roaster cleans up nicely and only set off the smoke alarm once. The chaff collector is easy to dump out at the end of each roast cycle. The instruction manual had the funniest artwork that made the reading material interesting as well as useful.The 9 lbs. of coffee was a mixture instead of one kind that I assumed I had ordered (no decaf which is fine for me). Estimate 65-85 lbs of roasting green beans, at $6 per pound, to begin to have this roaster start paying for itself. So for now it will be called a hobby instead of a money savings. :)"
4,Well made roaster,"I have been using this roaster for over a year with great results. It is a very quiet and very solidly build appliance; feels like driving a German car. The controls couldn't be simpler to use. As expected, it does make a lot of smoke, and proper ventilation is required.A portion of the plastic case started to melt near the exhaust which prompted me to lower the operating temperature. The power cord warms up a bit during operation."
2,The disposable Bic pen of roasters,"First off, I thought this roaster did a very good job. It was also nice to be able to see the roast level through the glass, allowing me to better judge when it was done. Having said that, I went through two of these in about 4 years. Both had meltdowns and incinerated themselves. The first was because I had one of the original SMALL chaff collectors that was just plain undersized. When the chaff collected, it created a tinderbox that melted the whole machine. The second time something happened where the rotating drum got jammed and, once again, the machine had a meltdown. Once the plastic gets to its ""flashpoint"" it's all over. It's like a nuclear meltdown. These machines are WAY too expensive to be made of plastic given their function. Bad design in that respect for too much money. I ultimately got a Behmor 1600 and, while it is not as good a roaster, it has a longer life span and is all metal."
4,Coffee roaster,My husband has roasted several batches of coffee with this roaster. Very good for darker roasts. He's still trying to perfect the lighter roasts.
3,I was expecting more,"Sure Roberta is a great singer, she has fantastic chops, a great voice, but does not have a sound of her own.On this cd the choice of material is not the most original either.Jazz is about creativity and passion and I am afraid this recording does not contain these attributes.I have earlier recordings that are much better and I am convinced that she could become a great jazz singer,but as with everything these days marketing is most probablythe main reason behind this ordinary release.If you like Roberta Gamabrini they are much better cd's available such as her debut recording ""Apreslude"""
5,Easy to Love,"Roberta Gambarini is just great. I just discovered her and am glad that I did. She has a delightful delivery that makes me smile. And to make matters better, she's Italian. Sooooo am I. lol"
2,Totally derivative,"Ms. Gambarini seems to have listened to one too many Carmen McRae and Nancy Marano CDs. Her phrasing, breath sounds, and tonal quality are completely derivative. It's not enough to have a nice voice and good skills. A singer has to have something unique and interesting to convey. What's the point of being a clone?"
5,Hot New Jazz Singer,"Roberta is the hottest new jazz singer that has come along for a long time and I hope to be able to see her live before she gets really BIG! I would compare her to Ella, yes, seriously. She has a beautiful voice, uses it like an instrument, does vocal improve with the best of them, and entertains!"
5,Best of the Best,I recently saw a video clip featuring Linda Perry on VH1. That prompted me to buy her CD In Flight and 4 Non-Blondes Bigger Better Faster More. What a treat! In Flight has several really great songs. See wikipedia Linda Perry for an extensive write-up about Linda Perry.
4,One solid album,"Linda Perry's songs have sold millions of copies, and she is a Grammy nominee, but one of her greatest achievements, her solo album In Flight, was sadly overlooked. This album enthralls me every time I hear it. I think it's even better than Linda's album with 4 Non Blondes. I read a review describing In Flight as ""dour"" and ""sallow,"" but these words hardly do the album justice. Several songs are indeed moody and downbeat (""Success"", ""Life In a Bottle"", ""Knock Me Out"") but there are also lively rockers (""Freeway"", ""Fill Me Up"", which got some radio airplay) as well as songs full of joy (""Taken""), humor (""Fruitloop Daydream"") and indescribable beauty (""In Flight""). The performances, by Linda and several members of the Tuesday Music Club (who backed Sheryl Crow on her first album), are solid throughout. The album isn't quite perfect; a few songs could have been trimmed, and one or two sound unfinished. But if you like mature pop/rock music, I highly recommend In Flight."
2,Surprisenly mellow and moody and boring,"If you are buying this album after listening to 4 Non Blondes and hope this is volume 2, skip it. While Linda Perry is an outstanding vocalist, this one doesn't rock. It doesn't skip either. An unfortunate sophomoric effort."
5,"""Will success fail me""-one of the greatest all time lines","This CD must be listened to over and over and all it's subtle meanings emerge over time. I bought two of these, one of the car and one for my home. I also bought this CD for every one that i knew that loved music and they all would also give it 5 stars. Hear her live, it will knock you out! Her voice is so distinct with it's rich quality of conveying so much of the emotion that are created by her amazing lyrics. GET IT and i guarantee you won't regret it !"
2,Too Loud,This device is too loud and causes incredible vibrations throughout the house. The resistance seems fine but there is no watching t.v while this is in use. I wear ear plugs during use.
5,A great CD if you're listening for acoustics and talent!,"Noa has a gorgeous voice that has no comparison! Her authentic Israeli sound is one you will definitely want to listen to more than once! I bought her CD not knowing what to expect, and I was completely blown away-- she makes her music a joy to listen to! Even if you don't speak Hebrew, these awesome lyrics are given to you! I will always rate this CD as ""5-star""!!! Everyone needs to buy this GREAT CD!!!"
5,Amazing voice and music!!!,"I am not Jewish neither do I speak Hebrew, but I absolutely loooved this CD! Her versatile style and great voice were a true surprise to me. Her most passionate and culturally authentic songs are obviously from her Israeli albums, and I would really like to get hold of THEM!"
1,a piece of crap,i started watching faces of death and cound not fathom this footage of brutality it stunk to high hell i look foreward to purchasing traces of death though
4,Faces of Death,"I do not agree with most people, I believe that this film is 100% real footage. Why would someone put half real, half fake footage on a documentary. Can we all say documentary, documentary means it is documented, this means real. This movie is a splatterfest of real blood and beheadings, it is not meant for the kind hearted and weak stomach person. If you love gore, pick up a copy now."
2,Not everything you see in this real,"Half of the death you see in this is fiction, because not all of it is meant to be real its meant to be entertainment."
3,"Death: part of life, and a lesson to be learned.","This film trilogy is indeed not for the faint of heart, but has an important lesson most of our post-modernistic society has forgotten: life is NOT fair. Life is short. Life WILL end. This documentary shows you many accidents and fatal errors caught on tape, all with a 'be careful, but be aware you WILL be here someday' attitude. For those strong enough to accept the inevitable I recommend this one."
4,Hilarious,"Ok, I will admit that some of the movie comes off cheesie, but that is what makes them great. The first time I saw these movies I was disgusted, then again I was only 12 or so. Now I watch them and I think that they are the funniest things that I have ever seen. Well, everything except for that whole monkey part, that was just wrong. And as for another ""critic"", from Kansas, I don't know how you can condemn anybody for enjoying Faces of Death. It is a cult classic, making it a great piece of WORK for anybody who wants to be grossed out or amussed. I recomend this for anybody who live horror movies, cause in this movie, it is like all the gore rolled into one"
1,Why????????????????????????,"Movies of this genre are sick and disgusting, why any one would watch them more than a few minutes is beyond me!..........The only good reason to buy this movie is to record over it."
1,You all disgust me...,"If you want to make something like this, go ahead. But leave the animals alone. Would you think it was fun to have someone beating you to death while the viewers at home laugh (and are inspired by) this? If you think watching animals get beat beat to death is fun, wait until your pet dies..."
5,The Best for a party!,"Even if this is not all the way real, this movie ROCKS! It has every king of death even all the way down to people eating monkey brains!It is very gross and demented but it is iteresting. Youll like it if you are in your late teens and early twentys."
1,Faces of Death/Faces:Fact Or Fiction,"This is an awful movie, not disgusting, just boring, do not buy it if you've downloaded FOD excerpts."
2,SHOCKING? OR JUST PLAIN BORING?!,"Okay, if you are looking for a silly narrator, cheap effects, and a boring video. This is for you. The rest of the reviews on how scary and gruesome it is, is just for money. Believe me! Don't waste your money on this, maybe a rent, but I do not even recomend that! The only scene was the eating of the heart, but that was even silly. This should be called kill the animals, and surgery film. Don't be fooled, the cover and reviews sound better but it's not. (Death is not close up.)WARNING: GRAB A PILLOW AND LAY DOWN!"
3,true or false,this film had me thinking is this possible? of course not how can camera men get so close to the action. Althought it was made up film it is still one to keep in the dvd collection so when the family come around you can shock them with this film and it will try showing the slaughter house scene when they are just tucking in to that stack
3,FACES OF DEATH..WHAT MOVIE!,I REMEMBER THIS MOVIE FROM WHEN I WAS ABOUT 12..IT SCARED ME TO EVEN THINK OF WHAT IT COULD CONTAIN...SO NOW ..LATER ON IN LIFE..I FINALLY WATCH IT..AND..ALL I CAN SAY IS...WOW! THIS MOVIE IS SOMETHING ELSE..ITS A GORY..SICKENING..GROSS COLLECTION OF DEATH..AND ITS GREAT!...DEFINETLY NOT FOR THE SQEAMISH...FACES OF DEATH 1 IS THE BEST BY FAR..THE OTHER 3 JUST GET CHEESIER AND CHEESIER..SO CHEESY ITS ALMOST FUNNY..BUT FACES 1 IS BY FAAAARRRRR THE BEST OF THE BUNCH...GET IT..SEE IT (not alone!) AND LOVE IT..A MUST HAVE FOR HORROR NUTS LIKE MYSELF!
3,"Well, he's laughing at us!","...Ok let's talk about the film... first of all when you discovered that someone lied to you very often you'll never believe anything he says any more... and that's why I no more can believe anything I see in FOD... I mean everything turned to be lies, even the animal scenes!The only things that are true are the corpses and the morgue which to anybody who went to Medical School is part of his education!!!I gave it three stars as follows: 1 star for the creepy music + 1 star for starting such films trend + 1 star for a good lie!But if you really want to see something genuine and real go ahead and buy ""Banned From Television"" where everything is genuine! Where FOD focuses on bloody scenes due to the lack of accidents on tape, Banned From TV focuses on no blood but REAL accidents."
3,Cool,"This video shows the reality of life and what happens during the course of this journey. People don't want to come to reality when death is near. They want to place it in the closet and forget until it is their turn. This movie is very helpful in coming to a more relaxed state when dealing with death. I don't want to die, just like everyone else, but this movie makes it easier to understand."
2,Ruined by bad narration.,"'Faces of Death' is a half decent film showing the gruesome deaths of numerous people. The movie is almost ruined by the awful narration, which is even worse than a bad horror flick. Nonetheless, it is worth the watch if you are curious about seeing people killed."
2,"Ok, if you take it for what it is...","Nothing more than a creative, but mostly deceptive exploitation of mankind's morbid curiosity of death and mutilation. Although the special effects were decent, most of the scenes were re-created. (For those of you who still believe it's real, read the ending credits.) Most decent Americans should find this movie repulsive in the least and is better suited for today's de-sensitized blood-&-guts galore adolecents than for mainstream horror fans. This movie does however take the credit for spawning the seemingly endless supply of actual death depicting videos and ""shocumentry"" TV shows. See FOD if only to say you saw it, but try ""Traces Of Death"" if you crave REAL footage of death, destuction, mutilation and mayhem."
4,A Landmark Film - but all fake!,"Now, listen carefully. Unlike it's sequels, this original 'Faces of Death' is almost entirely made up of fake, hoaxed footage. Granted, the animal footage is mostly real, and there are a few actual suicides, but everything else, from the electric chair execution, to the pathetic decapitation, is fake. After all, just ask yourself simple questions when watching. For example, ""How come they get so many camera angles when there's apparently only one person filming?"". You'll soon realize it's only a clever fake.However, this film is excellent. It is an unintentional comedy classic. Dr. Gross is hilarious, and anyone who's got a sense of humor will love the soundtrack - (Old MacDonald to headless chickens? Brilliant!). So, my advice? Buy it! Watch it! Love it! But please don't think it's real. If you do, then you're falling for the trick the film-makers (all of them actually Japanese) designed for the video-fodder market.Sit back and enjoy!"
2,"Less talk, more gore","I remember watching this movie originally when I was a young man and I remembered how wild it was to watch that stuff. So here it is many, many years later and there was nothing new to hope for. I know that the original was very grainy and amateur to begin with but they should have put more footage or better special features. I was tremendously dissapointed. At least when I was young I didn't have to dish out money to watch this but now I did! Bummer!"
3,Faces of Death 1,"Im only 16 and I saw this movie. I found out about it from a cousin. This movie I expected to be a ton more hardcore than it was. There was nothing in this movies I had to close my eyes for. To tell you the truth this movie is like a Disney movie. If you want to see REAL HARDCORE action dont look at Faces of Death 1, the others are more intense and sicker. If you want to laugh rent or buy this one. Faces of Death 1 is a beginner FOD movie!"
4,death meets technology,"I feel that this disc is the highest accomplishment of gorgan pictures, to offer such brutality on a dvd format is truely bizare. the old footage sure did look better, but i feel the real draw of this title was the fact or fiction chapter. first with the brutal death collage that it starts with is a sight to be seen . Next the fact that the director is disguised, with his voice also disguised electronically, also adds to the whole evil aspect of the faces of death series. I think this dvd was well done, and i enjoyed it. Im not saying it's for everyone, but im rating it on it's quality, well done. I found the demonic gorgan logo image at the begining of the disc amusing. I am not a death lover, but im sure everyone wonders about the authenticity of this film, and of the mysteries of death itself. i feel that the behind the scenes aspects made the dvd. i rented it though, it wasent something i wanted to leave around the house, but im sure fans will enjoy it very much"
3,fake,i would like to inform most of you viewers of the first f.o.d. that most of the movie was staged. There are some real scenes but the famous monkey scene and beheaded scene are faked just like most of the movie. The rest of the movies are pretty real though. Sorry to inform you for those who didn't know
2,"Being the first of a series, this was less gruesome.","The footage borders on too old, and i feel too much time was spent on autopsies. if i wanted to watch an autopsy, i would turn on the learning channel. I would recommend f.o.d. 3or4, or the best of, if want to truly increase your heart rate."
1,"This game does not deserve the name ""Dune""","Wow. When I saw the cover for this game, I thought to myself ""Finally! Somebody has made a 3D Dune game!"" Then I put the game in my computer and nearly broke down crying because it was SOOOOOO bad. I mean, this game is beyond bad. First: the story is confusing, and, as a fan of the Dune series, disgustingly wrong. Names are confused, people are referred to by the wrong titles, and it's just sad. It makes me wonder if anyone at Dreamcatcher has actually READ the book. Second: the controls are confusing at best, difficult at worst. You can't change them, so you better get used to it. The camera is dizzying and hard to follow. I uninstalled the game in the middle of the second level, because I got tired of restarting my computer every time Paul got caught behind a wall or in a wall and the controls froze. So, ultimately, if you like Dune, do not buy this game. However, if you like video games, do not buy this game."
1,Terrible Gameplay - could have been so good.,"This game was one of the biggest dissappointments I've ever had in a game. Dreamcatcher has made some great games, but maybe action games just aren't their forte. This game has terrible controls, you have to use the directional keys for movement and can't use w,a,s,d, so if you are right handed, like most people, it is realy awkward. Every action like opening doors or changing weapons is terrible. If an enemy actually sees you there really isn't much you can do but stand there while they shoot you to death. The voice work was ok, and the look of the game wasn't that bad, but all the other mistakes far outweigh any positives. I have a decent graphics card and it still took me quite a while just to get the game to work. A sad release of what should have been such a great game. I know it looks like fun but really don't bother with this one."
1,Huge dissapointment to Dune fans,"Story adaption is awful, gameplay is terrible, and user interface is very frustrating, to put it mildly. It appears they didnt do a lot of testing before releasing this opus barfo to the public."
1,Horrible,"Horrible only begins to describe this game. Putrid tripe put out to make a buck. Could they make the controls more confusing. If I were an octopus, maybe I would have arms enough to control the keyboard, mouse, and (I swear) telepathic controls. Did I mention that the game is horrible."
4,a fun representation of dune,"The characters don't look like any of the people you have seen in the mini series or the original film but the gameplay is easy to learn but very dependant on patience and awareness. Most of all stealth is required, much like in the Metal Gear Solid games you have to suprise your enemies and if you can't then shoot them at range.If your a dune fan give it a try but if you don't like to work in your games don't, this takes patience and control. Experience gamers only!rated 4 instead of 5 cause the character work is poorly done"
4,A good 4th book,"Jill Murphy has done a great job of writing the books about Milderd Hubble, the worst witch at her school. Most of the witch are very likeable. The book is very enjoyable."
3,Not the Best Hair Moisturizer,Horrible for my hair. It made it greasy and frizzy. It smelled absolutely amazing though which is why I considered purchasing it in the first place. It contains a lot of mineral oil which I later found is terrible for your hair. I wouldn't use it to moisturize daily I would only use it for the fragrance and very rarely.
2,Bad moisturizer,"My hair hated this moisturizer! I put some on my waves then about 15 minutes later, my hair was itchy and it was hard not to mess up my waves from scratching. The smell was great though, very pleasant and the shine was there too. Would I purchase this again, definitely not but my order arrived quickly."
2,Far from the best of Mobb Deep,"If you want the best of Mobb Deep, pick up The Infamous first and then pick up Hell on Earth. Those are by far Mobb Deep's best albums.This collection does not contain the best of Mobb Deep's work. Instead, it is more a singles collection. But when you have as many tracks from Infamy as you do from The Infamous, you know this is a flawed disc. Way too many tracks from the later Mobb albums and way too few from their earlier ones. Also, some key singles like ""Peer Pressure"" and ""Give up the Goods"" are missing."
3,Not the best.,"These are just A FEW of the best tracks made by the legendary duo Prodigy and Havoc, but this album definitely doesn't contain all of the illest songs made. It should of been a double or tripe disc cd. Definitely check out the Infamous and Hell on Earth, along with Infamy for the best of Mobb Deep."
4,Good collection,"Life Of The Infamous is as the title suggests the best of Mobb Deep, the legendary hardcore hiphop duo from Queens. Basically the album includes their hits from all stages of their career as all best of albums should do, up util track 9 you have all superb tracks from the 90's when Mobb Deep were untouchable, after that the album gets a little sketchy as they indeed did in real life. Still well worth buying if you dont own all their albums, especially for the tracks off Juvenile Hell, The Infamous, Hell On Earth and Murda Muzik, but in an effort to include all their hits (as they should do because it is a greatest hits album), it does include some pretty wack songs from their spectacular fall off in recent years. The new tracks are also nothing like the work they were doing in their peak.Still recommended for anyone who wants to start listening to the Mobb however all their long term fans wont find much new here."
4,"Solid, straight ahead rock","Melodic and thoughtful songs make up the majority of this CD. The hits are not the only things worth listening to, it is just good rock and roll without any of the dramatics heard so often from other bands."
4,i'm a tough grader,"this is wonderful. jakob dylan has a great voice. i like to listen to this when i'm feeling depressed. it lets me cry out all my depressedness its also the kind of thing that when you listen to it, u feel the vibrations of the song in your head and heart. they totally engulf you. and when you want to go to sleep, you can listen to this and have beautiful, deep dreams. its a real experience"
5,I think this CD is the best!!!!!,"The Wallflowers are a great band. I saw them live a year ago, and they were really impressive. I think you should take a listen!"
5,The most amazing CD I've heard in years!,"Jakob Dylan has the most wonderful voice. His songs are very touching. My favorite song is definitely ""One Headlight"". I can't stop listening to it. If you want good music, you have to buy this CD. All the songs are great. They are my favorite band."
4,"Very good ""pop"" album","Let's forget about the father's shoes he has to fill. Forget about Bob, this is Jacob and what HE does is simply ""good pop-rock""...period. GOOD POP-ROCK. Jacob did not want to reinvent the wheel, he just added a few spokes to a very well defined wheel. One Headlight is a good exemple of a well constructed song, and there are a lot of those on this album. Good singer, good musicians, good songs. What else could we want?"
2,This is Dylan's kid?,"I'm sorry, but this guy doesn't nearly have as much talent as Bobby does. It's an unfair comparison, but he could've been able to write more than this! ""One Headlight"" and ""The Difference"" both show writing prowess, but every other song is the exact same thing over and over and over and over again."
4,Great CD!,"This CD is an all around type of CD. Almost anyone will like it, and many will love it! The only reason that I gave it only a 7 is because the music on the CD dosn't have much variety. It is very repetive in rythem but the lyrics are very meaningful. This is the type of CD that you can play at a party or just some music to listen to at home!"
2,This album will collect dust after a few weeks.....,"Basically I got the album for one headlight and 6th ave. heartache (two stars for those two songs). I tried listening to the whole album once, and not just those two songs, and the album as a whole is pretty dull except for a few songs. It sounds too monotone, his voice, the instrumentation, everything! It has simply been tossed aside in my CD collection. You want some music with substance? Try listening to the Smiths, U2, depeche mode, or the cure."
1,ugh,"This CD was once my favorite...then I spent more than a year discovering REM and some other truly great musicians, and didn't listen to it once. A few days ago I had One Headlight running through my head, and I felt a twinge of curiosity for the rest of the CD as well. Oh Woe! It wasn't exactly painful to listen to, but so many of the rhymes and lyrics sounded forced, the music sounded bland and souless. And having 6th Avenue Heartache stuck in your head for 48 hours straight is enough to drive ANYONE batty. Ok, I'm done..."
3,"Jakob Dylan's CD gets a ""C""","Like most people, I just bought this CD for the single ""One Headlight"". Once I got this CD, you might say I was slightly ? dissapointed? There are too many keyboards, and some out-of-touch-lyrics. Where did ""Three Marlenas"" come from?!?! same with ""Invisible City"". The only good songs are ""One Headlight"", ""Josephine"", and ""The Difference"". Bleeders and 6th avenue heartache are okay. Be wary folks, you're in for a turbulent decision"
2,"The biggest ""just miss"" album I've heard","One Headlight is good but the rest is mediocre. Call it the ""just miss album"" of the decade, where the lyrics fall just short, and the instruments get old after the first minute of each song. A lot of talent, but can't quite put all the pieces together yet.Fastball fans, this is a must-try for you. If I didn't know it was the Wallflowers, I coulda sworn it was off of ""all the pain money can buy."""
3,"Not exactly good, but 3 stars.","What I mean is, not every song is good, but there are more good songs than bad songs on it. Bad lyrics in, ""Three Marleanas,"" ""Invisible City,"" ""Laughing Out Loud,"" and, ""Josephine, "" but the rest are fine. I like the guitar ending in, ""One Headlight"" that the radio dosen't play. Every song I like on this cd is my favorite, and I reccommend this album to you, and if you like people like, ""Semisonic,"" ""Matchbox 20,"" and, ""Fastball,"" and peole like that, you will probably like this band. However, there is one parental advisory: There are bad-influencing lyrics in, ""I wish I felt Nothing."" For some reason, I don't mind that, in this case, but if you don't, you might want to skip that track on this album. i believe that it isn't the lyrics' or songwriter's fault if these lyrics badly influence anybody. I believe that it is the listener's fault for believing it, and i don't believe it.P.S. After, ""The Difference,"" i don't like it when you have to skip 3 songs in a row."
4,Buy this but not cause of the rest of these reviews,"Now I like this album too, but could the rest of these fanatics slow down for about five seconds and think about what is being written. The problem with the rest of the reviews is the lack of description and lack of imagination when not giving a description. I would say that you don't even belong writing a review of a 'Wallflowers' record unless you r favorite 'Wallflowers' song is ""Asleep at the Wheel"". great my carpul tunnel syndrom is kicking in, anyways back to 'bringing down the horse' after your done with this ""man you gotta finish what you started"" and get ""Breach""."
4,Counting Crows?,If I listen to this album and knew nothing about the Wallflowers I would swear it was a Counting Crow album with a different singer.
5,The Wallflowers the best to hit the stage in a long time.,The Wallflowers sing a great folk-rock. The best songs are Josephine and Laughing out Loud. Sixth Avenue Heartach Has a Bob Dylan twist. Jakob Dylan writes great music for listening pleasure. The Wallflowers have a lot of potential.
4,A great collection of pleseant rock music.,This album is full of great pleseant rock music from the son of one early rock star. This album is something everyone should have in their CD rack.
5,Love these products!,"Dermalogica makes a great line of products. I love all the products in the oily skin kit, but especially the multi-active toner spray. These products do not dry out my skin, but are great for keeping oil and acne to a minimum. The clay cleanser has a tingling feeling that leaves your face feeling clean. The skin prep scrub is one of the best exfoliaters I have tried. The oil control lotion does not leave your face feeling greasy but does a good job of moisturizing. I love the multi-active toner spray because it is a moisturizer that you can spray on without having to rub it in and get your fingers sticky with lotion."
2,Bought it 2x,Did not work. Seemed to work at first and then stopped. I must have the worst oily skin ever. I felt stupid for buying it AGAIN.
4,Zzah - Smooth West Coast Jazz,"At times soothing 'Wanderin Cloud', at times toe tapping 'T. Louie', but at all times smooth. Zzah's first CD includes previously released cuts from 'Happiness' by Higher Feelings, the previous incarnation of this west coast group. Outstanding musicianship especially from talented keyboardist Richard Garoogian. A great broad brushstroke of the contemporary jazz scene sound."
1,Is this soap????????????????,"This product has no smell, produces no suds, and because of the shape, is awkward to use. It is extremely round and big so it is hard to get a grip on the product. In addition, it produces no suds! I've tried using it directly on skin, with a washcloth, with a sponge, and there are no suds!! Does it even clean???? No smell either. Complete waste of money."
1,Terrible PPV,"This was easily one of the worst WWE/F PPV's in years. Oftentimes with PPV's that aren't up to snuff, there's at least one match that makes buying the DVD worthwhile for the hardcore fan. Well I'm as hardcore as they come, and there is nothing redeemable about this at all. The cruiserweight match should have been much better, the main event is arguably the worst WWE has put on in 5 years, and the KOTR finals lasted less than 10 minutes."
1,king of the ring 2002 sucks,This is the worst pay per view ever in the history of the wwe. If you get this you are stupid and don't know anything about wrestling. King of the ring I have two words for ya suck it!
4,WWE King of the Ring 2002 review,"The RVD-Chris Jericho KOTR simi-finals match was a high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. The Test-Brock Lesnar KOTR simi-finals match was a average back-and-forth brawl. The Cruiserweight title match between The Hurricane-Jamie Noble was also a high-flying,hard-hitting match. The Ric Flair-Eddie Guerrero match was a pretty good match ruined by Chris Beniot's & Bubba Ray Dudley's interferences. The Trish Stratus-Molly Holly-Women's title match was not great but pretty good. The Hulk Hogan-Kurt Angle match was a solid,back-and-forth brawl. The RVD-Brock Lensar KOTR Finals was above-average at best. The HHH-Undertaker-World title match was a hard-fought,hard-hitting,entertaining,back-and-forth match with The Rock making it better. I give this PPV a 8 and a half out of 10."
1,"starts off okay,then sinks horribly!",match 1:rvd vs. jericho-good way to start off the night.8/10.match 2:test vs. lesnar-not so good. too much power moves.4/10match 3:crusierweight title-noble and hurricane do ok. 6.5/10match 4: flair vs.eddie- this was slow and stupid.3/10match 5:womens title-trish vs. molly- dumb. 3.5/10match 6:hogan vs. angle- slow and pointless.3/10match 7:KOTR finals-rrvd and lesnar have a much better match at vengeance.5/10match 8: title match- my god this was sad and terribly boring.0/10bad ppv overall.
2,KOTR 2002,RVD's matches make this ppv worth watching... He and Jericho battled a classic... The rest is mediocre at best...
1,So begins the Great Fall,"King Of The Ring is traditionally one of WWE's weaker shows of the year. This year was no exception. The Main Event between Triple-H and Undertaker is basically just 2 guys punching and spitting for 25 minutes, the actual tournament is between 4 guys who got no crowd reaction(and for good reason), the cruiserweight title match between Hurricane and Jamie Noble features lots of screeching and botched spots, the Ric Flair-Eddie Guerrero match is slow and stop-start, and the commentary is terrible. The only ""highlights"" are 2 mediocre matches in the form of Hulk Hogan-Kurt Angle, and Molly Holly-Trish. Not hideous, but not exactly good either. However, try and check out the funny Goldust/Booker T promo, at least until The Rock shows up and spoils it, anyway. Altogether, a big thumbs down for this show."
1,I can already tell you --This is the worst PPV for 2002,"I'll make this short and sweet, the matches were horrible, long, and boring. The King of the ring finalist match was the ONLY acceptable match on the whole card. Brock Lesnar is good talent. Kurt Angle tried so hard to get Hogan to make a good match, it didn't work. I am so glad Hogan tapped.Don't waste your money on new WWE PPV's... Get classic ones, like Summerslam 2000."
2,King of the Ring is the King of sleepfests...,"Once again the WWE falls short of putting on a worthy June Pay-Per-View. For the most part the whole card was slow paced. Not one of the King of the Ring Tournament matches were any good. Triple H and Undertaker, well, what do you expect? Taker's 40 years old, and Triple H hasn't been as good since he had his surgery. The only match I would consider watching over is the Angle v.s. Hogan match, but that's just because I think Kurt Angle is the best in the WWE. So the only reason I gave this PPV 2 stars is because I liked the pyrotechnics display at the beginning and the big chair in the king of the ring set was nice. Anybody that gave this more than 3 stars has obviously never seen a good WWE Pay-Per-View."
1,this was worse than barney,barney is better than this pay per view. This is a disgrace to the wwe. I would rather watch that big purple dinosaur. But no disrespect to ric flair who was in the king of the ring pay per view. Ric flair the best wrestler and the dirtiest palya in the game.WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
3,The Tenth King of the Ring is Crowned,"The 2002 WWE King of the Ring marks the dawning of the era of the Next Big Thing. Brock Lesnar dominates everyone who stands in his way of being crowned King and receiving an automatic title shot at Summerslam. In semifinal matches of the tournament, Chris Jericho battles Rob Van Dam, and Test tries to derail Brock Lesnar. Jamie Noble challenges the Hurricane in an outstanding match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Ric Flair goes one on one with Eddie Guerrero. Trish Stratus defends the WWE Women's Title against Molly Holly. Hollywood Hulk Hogan battles Kurt Angle. For the 2002 King of the Ring title, Rob Van Dam takes on Brock Lesnar. In the main event, the Undertaker and his Undisputed WWE Championship is challenged by Triple H. Keep your eyes open for the Rock as he leaves his mark all over this one. DVD extras include highlights from the entire King of the Ring tournament, superstar interviews and more!"
1,booo,"this is horrible.the only good match was chris jericho vs rob van dam which is now available on the rob van dam best matches dvd.anyway this is one of the worst wwe shows ive seen.i borrowed it from the library.im a big triple h and undertaker fan but even for me their match stunk here.avoid buying this at any costs.the extras are bad too.if you want to see the rvd/jericho match, get the rvd dvd which is out now."
1,King of the Ring 2002,what a dissapointment being it was the last King of the Ring. only a few good matches.p.s don't buy this video
3,not as good as 1998,this is the last pay per view ever in the wwe its cool with the undertaker v.s. triple h and brock lesner winning the tournament you can get if you want to its worth your money
1,one of the worst ppv's ever,"terriblre ppv. too long of a match between undertaker and hhh, the women's and crusiersweight title matches were so boring. the kotr tourn. [wasn't good].how could the wwe let some rookie win the kotr tourn?! angle vs. hogan was a slow match, and so was flair vs. guerreo."
1,I was at this event...,"I was at this event in Columbus, Ohio and let me tell you what a snooze-fest it really was! I actually nodding off during the ppv! Nodding off and I was at the event! I'm a huge wrestling fan and I have been to RAW's in Cincinnati and Columbus and I was really looking forward to my first ppv event, yet alone one of the top 5 (KOTR)! The only reason I am purchasing this DVD is to: A) Watch parts of the matches I fell asleep to and B) Try to find something worthwhile of spending my $$$ tickets on.Hollywood v. Angle stole the show in my book. I really liked seeing Jamie Noble's debut as I had watched him for well over a year in what was originally a few months ago a WWE development territory: HWA."
5,Life transforming!,"This is one of the most important books you will ever come across. I have had the privilege of listening to Dr. Sha's lectures on Power Healing and other subjects. This book shows how you can apply very simple technqiues to improve your health. I have also witnessed first hand how some people with ""incurable"" illnesses achieved miraculous results after practicing Dr. Sha's teachings. I recommend this book wholeheartedly and has bought many copies as gifts for my friends and relatives."
5,"Change your life for the better, read this book","Master Sha is the real thing, a humble Universal Servant of the Divine. This, and all of his books and cds bring Divine Love, Compassion and Healing to anyone who will simply follow the instructions and accept the Divine Downloads. I am so grateful for Master Sha and for the gifts he brings us from the Divine. These are among the most powerful teachings on the planet. Experience them for yourself."
3,Cree black second in series,I enjoyed the first Cree Black paranormal thriller and this sounded like an exciting premise but it was pretty slow.disappointing.
4,Land of Echoes: A Cree Black Novel,"The book set in New Mexico offered a realistic view of life here and a good satisfying mystery. Cree Black deals in ghosts, and the author makes her work believeable. I enjoyed the book, didn't figure it out until almost the end, and would read this author again."
4,"Interesting twists and turns, believable characters","This was the seconde Cree Black novel I have read. I enjoyed them both.The characters are believable, human and intersting. The ""mysteries"" entertaining and satisfying. I will be reading more of this series. Good read for those who love a bit of sci fi as well as mystery thrillers."
5,Absolutely 5 stars!!!,"As a long time Daniel Hecht fan, I could not wait for this next installment of the Cree Black series, and ""Land of Echoes"" does not disappoint. Hecht adds several new characters to his already stellar cast (Cree, Edgar, Joyce) and they are excellently rendered. Tommy's plight is fascinating and creepy and heartbreaking. The descriptions of Navajo country and people are beautiful, and easy to imagine, and they provide the loveliness and mystery which defines this book. It is a rich and exciting read. I highly recommend ""Land of Echoes""!!!"
3,Great PS3 Headset....Unless you use Wi-Fi Internet,"The short time I was able to use the the Logitech Cordless Vantage, I was thoroughly satisifed and felt it was well worth the price. However, since Sony update 2.40 on the PS3, use of the headset causes me to drop my wi-fi internet network connection. This basically means if you're playing on-line, you can't use the wireless headset. This problem does not occur with PS3 users that are connected directly using an Ethernet cable.Unfortunately, neither Sony or Logitech has an answer to the issue. In researching the Playstation Network Forums, other users are having the same complaint with other manufacturers of headsets too. ThoughI love the look, feel and sound of the headset, I can not suggest this product until Sony or Logitech resolve the issues regarding using a wireless internet connection with this particular blue tooth headset."
4,Perfect Non-Gaming Mic,"I've owned this headset for over a year and i have not yet had a single problem. It's very simple and easy to use with one button and 3 functions: On, Off, volume up and down. Personally I put the headset around my neck and position the mic so its neck to mouth because my ears get irritated by earpieces. It still works if i put my headset down a couple feet away and talk. It picks voices perfect and somewhat eliminates background noise. I have been told that it some times emits a frequency to other mics but that's rare. This mic is perfect if you dont want an expensive gaming mic and you just want to talk to your friends online.If you looking for a Non-Gaming mic buy this."
4,Caine works,A lousy ending detracts from a fine performance by Michael Caine. He is worth your time.
4,"Good Tunes, Good Album","Liquid Soul was somewhat recomended by a friend and so I gave 'em a try. They have a great sound. Very high energy and boogie worthy. After playing 20 seconds of a song you'll be asked ""who are these guys?"" Although the turntables get a little repetative at times, and the samples used by the DJ are outdated. Otherwise the horns keep a great tempo and the sequence of songs keep the album flowing. I'd rather see Liquid Soul live to catch their raw energy before buying another album of theirs. I wish I could have added a half star because 4 stars just doesn't do this album justice. Not quite 5 star material however."
5,SSSSSSSmokin' Liquid Soul,"This band rules !!! From the first listen they went to the top of my Top 5 all-time favorite bands. You just can't sit , this is get up and dance party music at it's best. GO LIQUID SOUL !"
5,PHAT!,"This is the best CD I've bought in a long time. If you like jazz, funk & hip-hop, you'll love Liquid Soul! Check out one of their live shows...it's awesome!"
2,Funk lackin' son of a.....,"Well, I thought going into buying this CD that I was going to hear a Brooklyn Funk Essentials/Groove Collective upgrade based on some of the reviews I read. I listened to the album and agreed that the band was good and that they probably sound great live. Unlike Groove Collective, Liquid Soul has a decent emcee that carries more than his share of a song's weight when on the mic. Still, the hornz seemed soulless, off-beat, and uninspired. The hornplay was good but not as good as the instrumentalists on from Brooklyn FUnk Essentials and Groove Collective. I will say I liked it better than Groove Collective's 'It's all In Your Mind' but just like that album, Liquid Soul left only a track or two that I'd listen to again. I was quite disappointed. I expected funky and got a little more jazz than I truly wanted.Y'all can have this one back."
2,Interesting book but too superficial,"This book is an interesting one for anybody who does not know a lot about business administration (management), but unfortunately for any student (even undergraduate) it es very superficial; Many chapters are about organisation, leadership and human resource management - it is only a summary of many interesting topics. I would eigher recommend to somebody who is really interested in management to buy one book about organisation, one about human resource management and another one about organisational behavior"
3,I had to take it for a class,I thought the book covered the basic very well. I took it as part of a management class and I learned things from it. I didn't enjoy it I thought it was heavily paded but it served its purpose. I would love to sell it someone for half price.
1,Terrible -- a 30 minute commercial for 6 Flags!,"This video has zero educational value. It is just a long commercial for 6 Flags which shows all of the attractions at their theme park.There was a lot of potential for a video about roller coasters. There could have been scientific tidbits about centrifugal force or how roller coasters affect our senses and bodies. They could have talked about how roller coasters are designed or given a close up look at the mechanics of a roller coaster. The other ""There goes..."" videos from KidVision have always had humor and silly antics, but also taught children something about the profession or vehicle which was the topic of the video. This video has no redeeming value. What a sell-out. I wonder what will be next in the series...maybe ""Here Comes a Chevy Suburban""???"
4,was skeptical,"I was skeptical that this design could handle my 28 lbs bookshelf speakers, but they seem to work. Some advise... the instructions don't tell you which end of the bracket is the top. at first glance it does not appear to make a difference, but there is a subtle size difference between the top and bottom of the portion of the bracket that mounts to the wall. this difference accomodates the plastic cover that sheilds the bracket. So be sure to put the smaller end at the top. I ended up installing mine upside down.Also, you will find it hard to find the correct hardware to attache the hardware to your speaker. the bracket takes 5/16 bolts, but the recessed head is too small to accomodate bolts that size, so I had to use 1/4 inch bolts that had a smaller head."
4,It's a shame I tell ya'!,It's a shame when a band like this hasn't gotten a single review. This album is great. The music is great. The vocals are great. Do yourself a favor and just listen. Listen and love.
2,"Well, It isn't BAD exactly....","No, really, it's not a bad game.But it's really nothing great. It has its moments, if you're just looking to kill some time or if you're really into strong bloody violence (I know I am).Very good graphics, and the character designs are (mostly) great. Animations and so forth are also examplory.Low Points: Very frequent and long loading screens --- Very complex and difficult-to-execute combos necessary to complete ""Konquest Mode"" or play on high difficulties --- AI which often just spams unbreakable combos [there are ""breakers,"" but they often seem not to work... unless of course the computer uses them, then they never fail]It's a good way to kill some time, and it becomes infinitely more fun with friends [and alcohol]."
5,So happy!,"We often pick up ears of corn on sticks slathered in butter and sprinkled with some kind of amazing chili / lime powder at the farmer's market. I've been hunting all over for a similar flavor so we can season our corn (and eggs, and poultry, etc.) at home. This is delicious! We especially love it on eggs and roasted potatoes. Delicious, though we all find the 'not a candy' warning on the lid hilarious."
4,Great for us dieters!,"I eat this on everything, because it gives a ton of flavor and almost no calories!--on cut up apple for a snack--on WASA crispbread topped with fat-free cottage cheese--on scambled ""eggs"" (counterbalances the fact that they're mostly egg whites!!!!)--sprinkled on vegetable soup--sprinkled on poached fishI swear, this stuff is responsible for about half of the 70 pounds I lost. :)"
5,YUM,"Growing up in San Antonio we ate this stuff called Lucas that's still around, but was said to contain lead. This tastes just like it. I peel a cucumber, slice it long ways, and squeeze half a lemon on, then sprinkle with this stuff and enjoy. It's so good, for those that like sour snacks. Tastes just like what the ice cream man sold in San Antonio as a kid."
5,Great for talapia.,"This stuff is great for seasoning fish. My wife and I use Tajin for frying fish and also oven or pan prepared with butter. I first came across this seasoning by accident and it hooked me the first time I used it. My mouth is watering just thinking about Tajin. I have never tried it on fruit, but I am sure it would be yummy!S.W. from Mississippi"
5,No kidding: on strawberry ice cream,"Try Tajin on strawberry ice cream: a tangy, sweet, cold, picante taste you will never forget. Also, echoing a previous reviewer, add lots of Tajin fruit seasoning to the flour, salt, and pepper when breading fish, particularly tilapia, for pan frying. Your taste buds will come alive!"
3,Tajin,"I've had Tajin in the past, and it is now different- it says clasico on the label, not fruit seasoning. It is alot more orange in appearance. They may have the same ingredients in a different ratio- not really sure. I am sure that I like the old version much more- much better flavor."
3,Tajin Fruit,Even though it arrive on time and it was what I wanted. One of the bottles looked very old and tasted different.
5,Awesome,"I recieved a sample of this seasoning when I bought a pineapple at our local grocery store. WOW! It really brings out the flavor of the fruit. If you're one of those people who like to put salt on watermelon or apples, you'll love this stuff. It's much more flavorful than salt. It also has chili pepper and lime - an awesome combination. Adds a little zing but not overpowering. I'm hooked. It's also good on grilled meats. I wish our local store would carry it."
5,Delicious chile y limon,"Great stuff -- I use it on not quite ripe fruits, such as mangoes or peaches. Also good on ripe tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. Product shipped quickly and received in good condition."
5,Great Book & Experience,"This is another cute book in the ""Cranberry"" Series. I have loved them since I was a kid and I'm not a kid anymore. But my grandkids will love them."
2,"Define ""good"" condition",Many pages of this book were folded over. I was very disappointed and would not have ordered it had I known.
5,Great Toy,We've had this train for 4 years now. My first son got it for his 1st birthday and it is now being used by my second son. It has had much use and it still looks new. A big winner when other kids come over.
5,An unexpected treasure.....very deep music,"I originally bought this record because I saw Phil Cody open for Warren Zevon years ago. While he played solo acoustic at the show, the album has a great Dylan/The Band vibe to it -- it's folk rock at its most dynamic. I noticed that all the keyboards were played by Rami Jaffee (of The Wallflowers) so Cody must be some songwriter who is revered by a lot of much more successful musicians"". I HIGHLY recommend the album....ESPECIALLY at such a great price."
3,"Great book, but the pictures aren't so hot...","The color and lighting in most of the photographs is poor...I understand this is an 'art' book, but when I am looking for a specific design, if the picture is going to be no bigger than a business card, I would hope it would at least be a straight on shot done in good lighting. If you want that, this is NOT the book for you...check it out from the library, at least then your disappointment won't cost you 20 bucks."
2,Hmmmmm?,"I found this film a bit boring to be honest and although Wes Craven had a little involvement, it was his son who produced this film. The whole thing was like ALIEN because of the environment and the acting was not all that good except for Lance Henriksen who has starred in so many top movies. MIND RIPPER is a film that I could'nt watch more than twice and a lot of people may find it a complete bore, but still, the F/X/ are not too bad."
1,of marginal interest,"The conceptual framework for this article about college reorganization is interesting, but the example used and the conclusions drawn from the authors' experience are unlikely to be relevant to other colleges undergoing reorganization of their departmental structure."
1,This film is garbage.,"This movie is the 2nd straight garbage movie I bought starring Jet Li.I guess all good actors have to play in a few crappy movies as well.I also bought Red Shaolin and I dont know which one was worse between this one or that one.I bought it for 16 dollars and tried to trade it back in only to find it was worth 2 dollars.Anyways back to this movie.The translations and dialouge is completely horrendous,the fight scenes arent good, and the storyline is corny.What the heck do you people see in this movie?If Fearless is a 5 then this is even below a 1.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!It is simply garbage and you're talking to someone that loves kung fu movies.All I watch is kung fu,action,and comedy.But of course mostly kung fu.It is not worth buying because you will be disappointed.You have been warned!"
2,Horrible,"Hard as it is to do, this film manages to make Jet Li look very, very bad. I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it. The action sequences are slow and awkward. Pass on this one guys."
3,The Master,"In 1989 one might have asked, ""who is Jet Li?"" But if you asked me, I would have boasted that he is a great martial artist. I could say this because I Also Starred with him in this movie. I played the part of Ruben (the short Latino gang member) :-). Let me first start off my critique of this movie by saying that I'd like to thank all those who took the time to share their thoughts with this forum. I personally thought the movie was full of down-to-earth, believable action. The overall acting is not that great, but the fights scenes are awesome. This movie could be enjoyable if you look pass the Hong Hong style of acting."
4,Entertaining...,"Although, Jet Li has better movies out on video and VCD, I thought this movie was entertaining and funny. Any Jet Li fan would like this movie for it's simple story line, yet awesome fight sequences. It was funny to see the 3 L.A. pseudo- street gangsters following Jet Li around after they failed to steal his luggage. It's entertaining to watch."
5,Great,"Besides the outstanding value, i very much enjoy the conducting. It is one of my favorite Bach performance that i have ever heard. Something about the orchestra and conducting just appeals to me and i appreciate the playing and conducting immensely. The quality is a little less clear than most modern CD's, as it is remastered from analog tapes, though it isn't unbearable by any means. I highly reccomend this collection."
3,"Great concert and music, disapointing quality","The concert presented in this DVD is outstanding. The song selection represents the best of Alejandro Sanz, and his energy and style are unparalleled. Unfortunatley, there is a very noticeable (and disturbing) timing mismatch between the video and the music. I am still trying to figure out if it only happens on my copy or if it's an error on all DVDs out there. Look for the next part of my review when I fugure that out."
2,i like it,"i don't know if it was dvd pirated or maybe was a old dvd . but i love that concert dvd so i really don't care, but i have to say that the image quality is very poor"
5,Not Just for Babies,"I just recently tried the ""Butt Paste"" and found that it has many uses (for adults too). You can use it on minor cuts and scratches, helps dry-up blemishes, and it is wonderful for healing hemorrhoids!"
2,Didn't work for me.,Other diaper rash products work just as well if not better. This also stains if you get it on clothes.
5,Perfect,"So muh better than anything else on the market. The smell of other brands are horrible, but the scent of the Butt Paste is very mild. Works well especially when applied liberally as instruct on the package and as encouraged by Pediatrician."
2,Yuck,"This stuff smells really bad! I am usually not one to discontinue use of a product because of something like this, but seriously it stinks. It is also VERY thick and difficult to get onto a little bottom. It is also difficult to get off of your hands when you are done. I now use Desitin as it works great and there is no yucky smell that comes along with it."
2,butt cream,My baby developed bad dipper rush due to a thrush. My peds MD recommended this product but I am not happy with the results. I bought diaper cream by Motherlove and I absolutly love it! it works much better on severe rushes!
1,Toxic avoid,"I read on goodguide.com that butt paste contains boric acid. This substance has been banned in Canada and the European union for baby products. Too bad as the stuff works well, if you don't mind putting something that can be used as a pesticide on your baby's skin. Shame."
1,Doesn't work.,"I'd say people are very delirious and following media hype of this product with their reviews. The product, when sat in its tube. In a room temperature environment (as it is supposed to do) separates itself into one part sticky clear oil, and another part the white/tan paste. The two ingredients do not work together as a whole entity and makes a mess on your hands and on the baby. I have yet to see it work for a diaper rash, mild or moderate... and it smells to high heaven. I prefer good old fasioned, orange A&D Ointment.... Clears diaper rash up in an hour for good."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!!!!","My 3 week old son came home from the hospital with a terrible raw spot on his bottom from too much pooping and wiping. We tried balmex and desitin both for a week and saw no change. We then switched to the butt paste and it cleared up right away! It has a great consistency, very smooth and not real thick and creamy, and a very surprisingly nice scent. My sons doctor even recommends this cream. Very good product that I wouldn't go without!"
4,Saved my baby's bum!,My 6 month old got his first diaper rash and this helped heal it so quickly that it was markedly better within a day. I just didn't notice when I purchased this that they wasn't the all natural formula.
4,Smells great!,"I like the smell of this diaper cream...it doesn't have that strong medicine smell that many diaper creams have. It smells very clean! The cream worked great for my daughter, but just ok for my son (he does have very sensitive skin and we have only found one diaper cream that worked for him after trying MANY creams). I will be re-ordering this cream...it's a staple in my diaper bag :)"
5,The Only Book that you want to read it on text's C#,"I want to thank every author who working on the C# handbooks , Even the C#'s Guru programmers need this book , Whether you are a beginner or a pro you will need a complete understanding of the text manipulation in C#, and this is only in this book, I'm so sad that there's no more handbooks on C# like VB.NET :-(, The books cover all the aspects of text from A-Z (and that what i like in the book).Thanks for all the authorsA Beginner"
5,The Authoritative Bridge Between English and Swahili,"The pricetag on this book is only a small reflection of its true value. For any Swahili/English scholar there is no better work. It is not only comprehensive, but also well laid-out and simple to use. It is invaluable for any translational purposes or for reading a Swahili or English Text if you happen to be a first language speaker of the alternate language."
2,"Perfect fit, but broke!!","I have had numberous back covers and most of them crack at the corners a few weeks after installation. This one is still perfect. I love the rubberized plastic feel, helps with it not sliding around on your hand.Update: Had the cover for less than a month, and one of the tabs on the side that holds it on snapped off. I am not rough with my ipad, and it does not get dropped. I take very good care of things. Now it's useless."
1,Don't believe the title!,"When it's advertized to me as a live album I expect a consistant recording. But this CD drops off at the end of every track like a CDR that has a 2 second gap between tracks. And some songs drop off before the end. The bands performance is rocking but I can't believe that they are happy with production. I get the impression the track listing is not the actual set list. When bands want to putout a concert on CD they have to cut some songs to fit but this is so chopped up it it shouldn't even be called a live CD. Zodiac Mindwarp is a great band in the vein of Circus Of Power , Junkyard , TSOL (With Joe Wood) maybe not to well known in the US but still worth getting their CD'S. But don't pay the premium price for this one. It's just not worth it."
2,"Ironic that this is called a ""Hush 10""","My first Elite Hush 10 that came with my aquarium setup years ago was a fine power filter and I liked it just fine, did just what it was supposed to do. However, several years later when the first one died, I purchased my first replacement power filter, another Hush 10, and this one isn't but just a few months old and it makes a tremendous amount of motor noise for such a small filter, able to hear it a couple of rooms away if all else is quiet! I purchased a 3rd Hush 10 power filter, assuming my 2nd one was just a fluke, but the 3rd Hush 10 was 85% as loud as the one I was replacing right out of the box! 2 out of 3 of these Hush 10's have been a flop, I'm on the hunt for something else that's quieter!"
1,Damaged product,Ladder was delivered wrapped in paper and plastic. No padding at all! Top of ladder was bent so bad will not go up. Very unhappy with this purchase. Do not recommend buying.
4,fine stuff,"It's always nice to see a Sugar Minott lp, because I know what I'll be getting from him- a top notch quality collection of roots reggae meeting nice dancehall grooves.While this lp is certainly not among the pantheon of exquisite releases (""Live Loving,"" ""Roots Lovers,"" and ""Black Roots,"" among several others) from the late 70's and early 80's that he released, making him a rising star in the dancehall scene, but it's clear that Minott is clawing his way back towards the top of the heap following a good decade or so of very lacklustre releases.While the cover of the Association's cheesy ""Never My Love"" is not inspired, much of the rest of the lp is, anchored by the strong ""Nice It Up,"" ""River Jordan,"" and ""The Vibes."" Minott's voice sounds as good as it has in years, and perhaps his new association with Prince Jammy will help propel this icon of dancehall back to the heights of respect and glory that he so deserves.Well done."
4,An outstanding tool to motivate learners to speak English.,"One of the most significant challanges for an ESL instructor is to motivate adult learners to try to speak the language. Jazz Chants has proven to be an excellent tool for me to achieve this goal. The Chants are theme-based and provide sufficient repitition to allow learners to practice the sounds and reach a level of comfort and feel successful. The use of humor adds significantly to the reception the chants receive. The students visibly respond with joy as they recognize the intended joke. Humor breaks down barriers and enhances the learning experience. Choral speaking works particularly well with beginners since they are most reluctant to give voice to their new language. They have a degree of anonymity in this environment, encouraging even the most timid to try out the words. I might think carefully about its value with more advanced students but in my beginner's class I wouldn't be without it."
4,A very interesting book of exercises. Hindemith provides compositions for the student to finish.,"This is a very interesting book for students who want to learn more about the application of the basic theory they have learned. Hindemith provides all kinds of short pieces to finish. He starts with canons and ends with large ensemble pieces. He provides some of the basic ideas and leaves it to the student (with the help of an able teacher) to work out sound solutions to complete the work.Of course, the idea is to not only work them out on paper, but to also perform them with fellow students and see if it actually works as music or not. Hindemith was always working towards building able and practical musicians, not supplying some dusty and largely useless principles to memorize.This is by no means a simple book, but very interesting and quite useful for a practical musician to work through."
5,The Cretan Runner,Wonderful book. Patrick Leigh Fermor's editing makes Crete during the German occupation come alive.A glimpse of heroism in an age which today is sadly lacking.
5,"Crete, in war time",This was recommended by a guide when we visited Crete recently; it is a splendid memoir illustrating the Greek way of life as well as the heroic people.
5,Amazing book,"While I really was fascinated as I read through the book, and I am really glad I read it there are parts that are graphic and disturbing. It was a thoughtful look into jewish history, which sadly is often unkind and harsh.I would really recommend this book."
5,Awesome book,I really enjoyed this book. It is the type that 'drags you in' and doesn't let go until you finish it. Very well written.
4,"Some unpleasant scenes, but so worth it!","Yes, the first ""book"" was grim and graphic. I can't say I enjoyed it, but I was interested in that period of history. I am not Jewish, but ""Jewish stories"" have always interested me. And I had never read any history or fiction regarding Jews in Europe during the middle ages.Each story got better. The last two were just fantastic. I could see them in a movie!One reviewer stated none of these women did anything of significance. I disagree. Doing a brave, or honorable, or right thing in your personal life is of significance, even if never known by another human. Several Rachels started off shallow and with no noble thoughts. But they grew. And that is what matters. They did not remain shallow.I recommend the book, but it is true that it is graphic about torture, and other unpleasant scenes."
4,Rachel,Reviews are difficult for me to write. A book is a good read if it maintains my intererest. Otherwise nothing else matters A good book is a good book.
2,Better books available along the same lines,"If you want to read a Jewish historical fiction, read People of the Book by Geraldine Brooks instead. The Books of Rachel is basically the same as that one, same historical periods, etc, but not nearly as good. I sampled this one on my kindle and decided yes, I'll read that one since it was under $3.00. But I didn't finish this one, I got to the second section and decided I didn't need to spend anymore time on it--it's boring and not terribly creative. I guess I compared it too harshly with People of the Book, which I loved. There are too many other good books out there to spend too much time reading this one. It's got a fine premise, though it's graphic and gory (but section one did take place in the inquisition, so it's not like you didn't expect it), but also dry and boring."
1,Too many swear words for a Christian book,"I thought it was gonna be a a beautiful story about a strong godly woman named Rachel. As a Christian, it hurt my eyes to read all the strong swear words the author uses...the C word, the F word, the B word....I only got to the third chapter before I stopped reading it."
1,Would not read,"I tried to read the Lives of Rachel by this same author and it was so sexually explicit and dirty, I stopped reading it and would not read this one as I could not think of reading something that might be the same. I was shocked to see that her books are called Christian reading."
2,No depth,"I have to admit up front that I didn't finish this book. I read about half way through it. The story follows a family line over a very large time period. Because it covers so much time, there wasn't much depth to each time period. It is series of mini stories, but they are not fleshed out well."
4,Rachels through the ages,If you want a history lesson as well as a good read then The Books of Rachel is for you. I was not aware of the Spanish Inquisition and how terribly Jews were treated. I am a reader of Holocaust books but this book showed me other centuries and the continued suffering of the Jewish people. The good news is that there are many love stories intertwined and it is not just about sad events. The stories move quickly and keep you looking for more.
5,The Books of Rachel,"Hated for it to end. Good story, interesting historical facts about customs, beliefs, etc. Good character descriptions that added to the plot."
2,inquisition too graphic for me,"I purchased this book for my Kindle Fire as I enjoy reading historical Jewish fiction. However, I only got through the first few chapters because I found that the description of the torture in the inquisition scenes too graphic - it stayed with me after putting the book down and not in a good way.The author's writing style was easy to read and maybe I could have enjoyed the book; however, I have an aversion to reading for enjoyment details of people being tortured. If this doesn't bother you, you might enjoy the book."
1,Ewww.,I was shocked by the graphic content of this book and couldn't read past the first chapter. The author dwelled on scenes of torture and sexual abuse. I expected an inspiring tale of generations of strong women and got nauseated instead.
3,"Interesting story, LONG book","Not sure what it is exactly about this book that makes it so dense to get through... It is fiction meshed with non fiction, and certainly provides an interesting perspective on being a Jew (and a woman) in various different times in our history, however, I did not particularly find it engaging.I should add though that several women in my family have read this book and absolutely loved it. So perhaps it is just not my cup of tea. :)"
3,Too much violence,"I thought I would like this book, it sounded very interesting and had historical significance. About 18 % into the Kindle version I had to put it down. The constant torture was more than I could take. Tried skimming through to see if it turned for the better but found that it did not. Was well written otherwise, but I feel the story could have been told without page after page of gruesome torture."
5,Baa Baa Black Sheep,I bought this box set for my husband for Christmas. This is absolutely awesome. We are both enjoying watching the episodes. High quality DVD! It was really a great experience working with Amazon. Fast service and a great product! Thanks for everything!
4,Very Retro - Very Good,A walk down memory lane for me. Very retro but a very good story about a real American hero! Pappy Boyington and Robert Conrad are both legends and heros of their time.
4,TV Classic,"I grew up watching TV shows like this and this was one of my favorite. 30 years later I can sit here and revisit the series and I enjoy it just as much. As a historian, I know that about 99% of Greg Boyington's version of history is either totally false or wildly inaccurate, but this is still a fun series to watch. Just the sight of the F-4U Corsair in a flight of four is worth the series."
5,Great,I have enjoyed the movies.Great delivery timing and shipment from the co.Price is fine would have loved a sale on this though but this was what was asked needed.
3,"Volume One, Not Season One","When I opened the shipping box, I was surprised to see that I was only getting half of Season One. I need to train myself to make sure that the Title reads ""Season One"" instead of ""Volume One."" After the initial shock, I started to enjoy the episodes I remember when the show was called ""Baa Baa Black Sheep."" I like how they kept the scenes of what was to come before the opening...a 70's TV drama thing."
4,"We are all little lambs, who have lost our way... Baa Baa Baa","Only a few words: if you love warbirds (especially the F4U Corsair) and the tv series of the 80's, this box is a MUST!"
4,"Yeah, release the rest of the episodes on DVD, you dorks!","I agree with Mr. Frederick Young's assessment. Unbelievable that they charged what they did for a handful of episodes and they still haven't released the rest of the episodes yet on DVD. I gave it 4-stars, though, because it was great to see the Flying Misfits pilot episode again, in particular. It's a fun series and Corsairs are awesome, despite the technical flaws and bloopers in the series that others have pointed out. So, get a move on already and release the rest of the series."
2,"Great SHow, Lousy DVD","This is a terrific show produced by the great Donald P. Bellasario (of Magnum, P.I. fame) but the DVD is terrible. It freezes and skips and makes itself impossible to manuver through the menu. Some serious quality corners were cut in the manufacture of this turkey."
5,Black sheep One,"got this one the same time volume two arrived & have been getting as much use out of this set as I am volume one. If there are any more volumes out there, please let me know! Sincerely, Thomas Graham"
4,It's about time the Black Sheep came to DVD!,"I've been asking Columbia House for this series for a while now, as they've been putting all the old shows on DVD. It will be great if this show could have a second life on DVD. Hopefully others will come to enjoy it as much as I have."
5,"In Praise of Baa Baa Black Sheep and Major ""Pappy"" Boyington","Volume 1 is the original pilot providing the background of Major ""Pappy"" Boyington who won the Congretional Medal of Honour starting with his time in China and then the details of how he put together the Black Sheep from a bunch of cutthroats and misfits who had all originally been scheduled for Court Marshall. He put all these guys together and they formed the most fearsome squadron in the Pacific during WWII.The photography is excellent, the dialogue believable, it is full of action and it is based on the true story of ""Pappy"" Boyington. The Technical Advisor was actually Pappy Boyington himself.If you like stories from WWII, you will love this."
5,"Baa, Baa, Baa",What can I say.... awesome. I was so excited to see this come out on DVD. The quality is great and it brought back all the old memories of growing up watching this classic TV WWII series. This is a must have for any red-blooded American guy's DVD collection. Long live VMF-214!
4,don't forget Meatball the Bull Terrier,"This series also features Meatball, a white Bull Terrier (with a spot around one eye). The dog is reasonable prominently featured."
5,Baa Baa Black Sheep,"It is the best, I love watching them they remind me of when my dad was alive and we would watch them together."
3,Buyer beware!,"I still love BBBS after all these years, but buyer beware! The cheapskates at universal selling this series only package half the season but sell it at a full season's price. The pilot and the first couple of installments are heavy on the drinking and womanizing, but it gets toned way down after that. I seem to remember a lot of people complaining about that and they made it more family oriented after that."
5,baa baa black sheep,I really enjoyed watching the show as a kid and I still love it. I only wish I could get all the episodes.
3,BBBSV1,"Good grief! These negative reviews because this show is historically incorrect? I don't remember it saying that it was historically correct. If you want accuracy watch a documentary. This is a very entertaining show but it does have Universals Kiss of Death with minimal extras, double sided DVDS and only 11 episodes. The show itself gets 5*, Universal gets 1, so I split the difference and gave this package 3*. Our only hope for all future releases is that Universal will source out everything to Paramount!"
3,"Good, but overpriced","If you were a fan of the show, and did not record the History Channel reruns, then this is worth adding to your collection. However, for only half a season, it is ridiculously over priced at the MSRP. I got it used for less than $20.00, and I wouldn't pay any more than this."
4,Good series with lots of detail,"The script of each ep is undeniably story-packed! Robert Conrad is superb in the lead as Major Gregory ""Pappy""Boyington and he gets great support from the actors playing Gutterman and Anderson plus actor Simon Oakland as General Moore! The show is only ok in period flavor at this point (by season 2 the period flavor will evaporate more)!"
4,Funny and Thought-Provoking,"I love Sylvia's sense of humor and the information she claims to be channeling is very thought-provoking. I'm pretty much an atheist now (or post-theist, more precisely) but Sylvia's take on seeking spiritual truth is very wise. It's the people who think they know it all when it comes to religion are the ones who frighten me. This is well worth a listen."
5,"The ""SPIRITED"" Sylvia Browne","What a great CD. I love to listen to it while on long trips. Sylvia keeps me awake, entertained, and wanting to hear more."
1,Find Your Angels and Spirit Guides Elsewhere...,"I bought these CDs for a friend of mine with Multiple Sclerosis. She is very spiritually connected and conveys this message just by existing in her tiny room...She was looking forward to hearing this CD and when we chose the time, she became more and more horrified with what this woman was saying. She is flip, arrogant and contradicts herself several times. It was actually a pretty scary experience. It's as though she has been so jaded by life, there is no emotion or compassion left in her. I would suggest other authors or avenues if you are looking into your spirituality."
5,Great tape,"This is a great tape for Sylvia's fans. The tape is a fast-paced guide to spirit guides and angels. Sylvia's sense of humor comes through, and you will laugh out loud at her funny tales of some of her readings. This is a great tape!"
5,Delightful!,"I absolutely loved this tape. After hearing so much about her, I had tickets to see her, but alas, it was cancelled due to 9/11. So I bought the audio tape ""Angels and Spirit Guides"". I didn't expect it to be nearly as great as it was. Sylvia combines humor, wisdom, and honesty to deliver a message of spirtualism that, unbelievably echoes my own unshared beliefs. I will be ordering this tape for several friends, one in particular who lost a daughter, for Christmas presents this year.Highly Recommended."
5,Wonderful!,I Love J.Lo and this movie is brilhantand VERY ROMANTIC but not is totaly comedy have drama too!Jennifer surprise me again!
3,predictable...but good,"Although this movie is lacking inquiry, you can respect the movie enough to want to watch it just once. Considering JLo's new singing style, I prefer to watch her movies instead because her songs are dumb. I think that she's a good actress, not great.I have a few complaints about this movie though. First of all, if she doesn't have the best job, and she's living in New York, how does she have all those nice clothes,(I'm not talking about the clothes she tries on at the hotel) when she's at her apartment and when she's going to work she has really nice clothes. Also, there wasn't a lot of chemistry between the couple. This movie could have been a bit better, but it's good if you just want to watch a movie.I don't think it's really worth buying...just renting"
1,Its terrible!,I hated this movie so much! it had no plot it just got to the point it had no drama at all...well i dont like Jlo at all but this movie just proves she cant act the only movie i liked of her was selena.where did that actress go?
3,Yawn...Typical Cinderella Story With a Bad Lead Actress,"Maid in Manhatten was a very predictable, boring movie. Jennifer Lopez, playing the role of a struggling single mom and a hotel maid, was a bad actress in a bad role. Ralph Fiennes was not too bad, but was totally clueless the whole time in the movie, making him look partly stupid. I regret buying the DVD, because Lopez was so bad. That is her last film I will be watching."
2,weak script,"Compared to this, WEDDING PLANNER was a work of art. First of all while Jennifer Lopez's character is well developed, however the alleged ""Cinderella"" romance consists of what: some Playboy politician getting hot for her and taking her to his hotel room. The matchup just doesn't work here at all. As for this being a ""comedy"", well I didn't see too muchNow of course we are eventually told they are ""still together"" after one year"" -apparently another successful ""Cinderella"" shackup 21st century style.Wedding Planner had all sorts of nuances and interesting things going on with time for the main characters to become real, this movie lacked that.The butler actor was quite good, he did a great job."
2,Same old.......,"Why is it when some actors get some success they immediately go straight to the formulaic romantic comedy? Jennifer Lopez was great in ""Out of Sight"" and ""Serena"". But now all she makes are these follow the formula bore me to tears, not so comedic romantic comedies. The only exception of late was her movie ""Enough"", and when you saw the preview to that you automatically knew how it ended and didn't need to watch it. It is unfortunate when talented actors go straight to the easy money maker instead of looking for something challenging like the projects that showed us how good they are in the first place. And Mr. Fienes should know better, someone must have some blackmail info on him to get into this piece of junk."
1,It really is a lousy way to spend an evening,"One of the most inane scripts ever to be ""maid"" into a movie, each and every one of the actors in this tripe, including such gifted actors as Bob Hoskins and Ralph Fiennes should apologize to every viewer of this dreck for the wasted 100 minutes that we will never get back from our lives."
2,A romantic tragedy,"Someone told me that 'Maid in Manhattan' was a romantic comedy - at least that's what it is/was supposed to be. But pardon me, it is a tragedy (at the box-office, for sure!).And this movie proves beyond all doubt that J.Lo cannot even enter the realm of acting. I pity Ralph Fiennes, for he is such a gifted actor, who was not used properly in this flick.The story? A senatorial candidate falls for a hotel maid, thinking that she is affluent, and they realise later that though the Manhattan and Bronx come 'as the crow flies', they are worlds apart.Watch this only if you are of the very romantic types. Again, if you are too bored with yourself, then try watching this. Otherwise, my good friend, you will do well not to."
1,demeaning and insulting to Jennifer Lopez and LATINAS,"See Out of Sight instead where she gets to play some one with talent and wit. For Jennifer Lopez at her most stunning, sit through Mi Familia in which she makes a lovely cameo."
2,I am a Fan of Jennifer Lopez since wedding planner... but...,"I rented this movie wanting to see it, and also being a fan of Jennifer Lopez, but I can honestly say, it couldnt keep my attention, and I actually STOPPED the movie halfway through, and watched something else.. and I have no desire to watch the rest.. I thought the plot was boring.. and I'm kinda sad that Jennifer Lopez played the lead in such a bad movie.. I'm sure if she wasn't in this movie it would have done a lot worse.If your curious about this movie..I recommend to rent it first before buying it.."
3,boring same old story,"this film is probably going to bomb. there is so much competition for the movies when this film will be released, and the story is worn out. Already people are making the comparison that this is another Pretty Woman story -- a rags to riches story of how a woman rises to the top. Why is that she needs a man? This is the 21st century. A woman can rise to the top on her own."
2,"Poor Casting, Predictable Story","Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes. Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending. There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl."
1,JLo sux big time,"This movie is awful. The storyline is rushed and incredibly predictable. JLo is trying to put herself in the category with Julia, Kate, Sandra, Renee, etc. as a cutesy actress, and it's just not happening. The only movie I liked her in was Selena."
2,Pretty Woman It's NOT!!!,"Okay, so I had a giggle or two but for the most part...there was no real chemistry between the two leads and the believeability of their ""love affair"" was about as believeable as saying that J'Lo is still ""Jenny From The Block"". Wait for it to be released on primetime."
1,Like it would ever happen,Jennifer Lopez give a not so good performance. There is just no Chemistry with her on screen.
1,SAME TIRED PLOT!,"I am so sick of these plots, but who in their right mind would compare this to ""Pretty Woman"" is beyond me. There is zero chemistry between Jennifer Lopez and Raplh Feines, zero. Once again J.Lo gives an okay performance, which leaves you with, what is she worse at, acting or singing? I wouldn't buy this without renting it first, maybe if your bored on a Saturday night and you watch this you'll be slightly entertained, but that's it.That's my two cents."
2,"""Squeeze the circle, tighter and tighter...""","bah. this movie was a teeny bit OK, but nothing special. It's basically about this maid in manhattan."
5,caught it in production,not much of a review but more of a comment. i was in nyc this summer when this movie was being filmed at the waldorf astoria and i must say that it should be big. jennifer lo has serious whip appeal and ralph fiennes is pretty tough. it would be a shame to see this movie flop.
3,thee stares only fore j low,"jo low sghas everyone noes is da gereates actreseses dat every loieved. she sisr eallay the best. anf itms too bad dat maid fint mahnatan isn't ads htgood of a flick as it couljjd of beenm. becaise we all now dat j low derfcsreeved de best. ohnl,uy soem ple,eooer shouodl watch dis flcik. because j low has made otrher better flick klike thje cell the singnlemn gereates moboihe ever. othnetr flicjks like angel eyes and ananzconda. so maihjd ihn mahne5tghenb is an okaye flick. it hads somde egood afcytimng and the too actorsxs r okaye in it.....word out."
1,Just Plain Horrible,"This movie has no sense of script. The two people that fall in love barely even meet eachother when they do. I would write more, but this movie was so boring I practically fell asleep through it and I just can't remember much of it. Never buy it. If you want to see a real movie than go to a theater to watch Chicago."
3,"Not great, but not a complete disaster","This movie kept me interested for the most part, but it moved way too fast throughout the plot. There was no resting on any one event or calming down whenever the ""love"" came into it. If you like movies that concentrate on the love between two people that have just met this movie may not be the best choice for you. However, if you like movies where the little kids in the movie are the best characters this movie would be perfect because the kid who plays JLO's son really made an impact in this one!"
4,A Modern Fairy Tale,"I've seen Maid in Manhattan criticized as a ""rip-off"" ofPretty Woman. That misses the point: both are simply a modern retelling of Cinderella. Maid in Manhattan sticks much closer to the original stories than Pretty Woman. And, while the ""Prince"" in this version is a politician, the political commentary is kept to a merciful minimum--in contrast to 1998'sEver After - A Cinderella Story(also a decent film, but a heavy-handed one).Certainly, the story is formulaic and the characters are stereotypes (or, if you like, archetypes); nor are Lopez and Fiennes able to rise above the material. But the acting and production are competent and the movie succeeds as a big-budget, up-to-date fairy tale. The soundtrack is also much better than the usual fare. Highly recommended as a ""date movie"".Note to Soul music geeks: watch the credits and look for the full name of ""Rufus"" the dog."
3,Sugary goodness overload.,"Maid in Manhattan starring Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fienes is so fluffy and morally good it makes me sick inside. Surprisely Lopez is not bad in this role, she is quite likable but her character can be a little too preachy and judgmental towards Fienes's political character. And boy Fienes is a nice piece of eye candy, what a hunk! This is one of those movies you just watch once 'cause it's simple, predictable, and not very memorable. Some of the scenes are just way too long, it's like get on with it already! If you are a fan of romantic comedies then this fluff is for you."
2,average chick flick,"well all ive got to say about this movie is its another chick flick. guy sees women. women sees guy, they meet in some awkward situation, they fall in love eventually, the end. the movie doesnt really have anything special about it (except that it has jlo in it of course...... lol) but i honestly wouldnt even rent it unless u rent movies a lot. but if u got like comcast digital cable look for it on there."
2,"Cinderella version ""n""","This film doesn't have anything new. It's not even funny, so it cannot be a romantic comedy. I think it is sort of a melodrama.Lopez makes it clear that is not a good actress (full of blinks, gasps and tics), and Fiennes is dull and annoying (yes: a real politician).Besides it is annoyingly full of stereotypes (see the legion of maids of the hotel, see the politician's team, see the awful scene in the jewellery). The story of Cinderella is re-visited for the n-th time and the final is really predictable. Oh, where is true love?There are no strange situations, no close encounters, no blinking gazes, no love tears and no love joy. Very superficial.I really prefer Jennifer Lopez being JLo. See whatta mean?"
3,"Funny movie,though...","though its not her best movie ever, if you want to have a 'easy' evening and dont wanna watch nothing thats about shoting, killing or an really 'serious' movie, thats the movie to go for! Its easy, doesnt make you think a lot. But its helps you to feel better, and why not happier, forgeting about every day problems by watching a Cinderella story, which makes you believe that miracles still happen will work for sure! If you're not a JLO fan, or of any other actor involved, but feel like dreaming go for this movie.If you are a JLO fan, I dont think you need reasons to buy this dvd ;)"
3,It was fun!,"I enjoyed this movie - it was fun to watch even though you knew the end. I thought Jennifer Lopez was charming and Ralph Finnes who is usually so somber and brooding was delightful. The supporting cast was good, especially the young man who played the son. As serious and graphic or just stupid as movies can be today it's nice to go sit in a theater for 2 hours and come out relaxed and smiling."
4,Maid In Manhattan Made To Entertain,"If you've seen the previews you've probably guessed how this story will go and how it will end. But don't let that deter you from seeing this light romantic comedy that entertains thanks mainly to the acting of Jennifer Lopez and her chemistry with her on-screen son played by young Tyler Posey. Her scenes with handsome Ralph Fiennes are chastely romantic as Cinderella heads steadfastly toward ""happily ever after"" with a minor glitch along the way. The minor characters are all great, though none achieve the level of comedy you feel they are capable of reaching. Still, this tale of mistaken identity and a love that crosses social and economic class lines is a pleasant way to spend an hour or so escaping the freny of the malls during the holidays."
2,"Dull, dumb","I don't particularly care for J. Lo. But I watched ""Enough"" on cable and I have to admit, it was pretty good. So, I gave ""Maid in Manhattan"" a try and thought maybe I'd have to become a fan of Miss Lo if the movie was good. It was stinkola. She is totally unbelievable in the role. There was no chemistry between her and Fiennes. The plot was dumb. It just did not hold my interest at all, it was tough to sit through the whole thing. I'm okay with preditable, sappy, dumb romantic comedies, but this was just plain boring. I was very disappointed. I think J. Lo is really an ok actress with some potential for making decent and entertaining films, but this isn't one of them."
4,Cinderella with a twist!,"Very much a movie at life ""today"" in the working world for a single mom. It was entertaining, the cast was fun and well done. The timing was right on. It appeared to be very predictable but just when you thought you knew- the plot made a shift. I laughed a lot, wanted to cry and was deeply moved as I watched the hearts desire being complicated because of prejudice and social class. It may take some good discussions to unpack all this little film holds about the human condition but this viewer got a lesson, a good reminder of how things too often are- and the way they should be able to be. Check it out, well worth the ticket."
5,Lots of fun!,"JLo was great! I liked the movie a lot because she protrayed a true latina living in the U.S. So many people assume that you don't know how to speak English or even choose to call you a typical name like ""Maria"" just because you look Hispanic. It was also great to see that a ""Hispanic girl"" did something with herself even going against her own mother's [wishes]. The kid is great and also shines light on Hispanic kids who are bright. So many times our Hispanic kids are protrayed as having learning disabilities or even having difficulty speaking English---Marissa's boy is not only very smart but also an outstanding public speaker. All in all this movie is great for the whole family! I give it a very high two thumbs up."
5,great movie,i luv jennifer in this movie and the little boy who plays her son is so adorable picture is clear and the guy who played her love interest he was good too great movie i luv it!! try it!!
5,Sweet as sugar...,"This movie was sweet in every respect. Jennifer Lopez is absolutely stunning in this film and is perfect in this role. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will warm your heart. Definitely a chick flick - but for me, one that I can see over and over and never get tired of the way it makes me feel when it's over. Dreams do come true ..."
4,Maid in Manhattan,I enjoyed this movie I like Jennifer Lopez and feel she did a great job with it I would recommend it
3,Could have been worse...,"This is a cute story and not really a stretch for anyone--since all the actors play themselves. But its barely funny (and even less believable) and it just goes flat.I saw this on a plane, along with Two Weeks Notice. I probably wouldn't have seen either of these chick flicks but it was interesting to see how Two Weeks Notice took a much less interesting premise and, with a good script, made it truly funny and charming. Whereas Maid In Manhattan is really a vehicle for Jennifer Lopez and the story is secondary."
1,Fluff for bubbleheads.,"Another lopez ""vehicle"" in other words people who think Jlo is the ""bomb"" will watch it no matter how many other fine movies are out there.It's too hard to find them. Just go see dumb jlo movie. She's ""really good.""OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the ""not helpful"" button, and the smart people can, at least, consider what I've written. Not too many smart people here anyway."
4,Brilliant movie,"Jennifer Lopez has iffy moments in everything: She can act if given the right part (as in her big screen debut in 1997's hit Selena or in U-Turn) and she can pull of mediocrity in her singing career--if given the right song. She stalled in her portrayl in The Wedding Planner, but in Maid in Manhattan she gives an amazing performance as a believable girl from the Bronx working in a high class New York City hotel. Not only is the story real life, but all the actors (even the supporting ones) give brilliant performances, including the child actor portraying Lopez's son. The story has its Hollywood moments, but it's still believable and amazing."
3,J.Lo Maid in Manhattan,"It's an old Cinderella story, what else is there to say? Jennifer Lopez was awesome like usual. She is probably the only reason why to see that movie. The soundtrack is great, nice music. It's better than just watching regular T.V."
3,Pretty Woman + a cute kid.,"Swap out the hooker for a hotel maid and add a cute kid and you have ""Maid in Manhattan"" instead of ""Pretty Woman"". I was kind of surprized that J. Lopez would appear in such an obvious knock off. Did she need the money that bad? Aside from all that, it was an entertaining movie and I'd give it 3 stars."
3,"Great Music, much from the 70's","Marisa, is a good person. She's genuine. While she appears to hold high morals standards as a mother, she is gently lured into the temptation to ""misrepresent"" who she is. The consequences are fun for the viewer."
1,Boring and Predictable,"This movie is obviously some kind of ""star making"" movie vehicle for Jennifer Lopez. Unfortunately, it takes more than J. Lo. to make a movie. She was believable as a mother and a maid and as someone striving for more, but she and Ralph Fiennes have no on screen chemistry. His British accent kept popping through. Also, in one scene, Jennifer borrows the clothes of a wealthy guest and she looks just like she does in the Enquirer! You can see the end of this moving coming after just five minutes. The one bright spot is boy who plays her son, who did a great job! If you want to see a movie about people from two different worlds getting together in a love story, try Two Weeks Notice."
1,Cringworthy ...,"I love boy meets girl films. I have them all in my collection. The only reason I was interested in seeing this film is because Ralph Fiennes was starring in it. What a shock!! The question begs to be asked, was he paid millions or was he not in possession of his five senses when he agreed to star in this piece of junk. There is absolutely no chemistry between him and J Lo at all, nothing, not a piece, not a sniff. I was bored and couldn't wait for it to finish. In most romantic films you are left wondering whether the actor and actress get together off set life because they make it look so believable on screen. If you are hoping to see another - Pretty Woman, Only You, The American President, then please save your money. This film was terrible. Shame on you, Ralph."
2,another star vehicle,"Jennifer Lopez made some interesting films early in her career (mid 90s) such as U-Turn, Money Train (small part) and Out of Sight. She was on her way to becoming a dependable character actress. Then she morphed suddenly from Jennifer Lopez to J-Lo, media and pop superstar.Since then, Lopez has turned into a pretty, female Hispanic version of the early 1960s Elvis - churning out bad movies in between forgettable pop albums, one after another. Her films are largely vehicles to show off how adorable and talented she is.Lopez is clearly trying to reclaim her working class roots by making this film about an Hispanic single mother who somehow gets the rich (white) guy. If this film is another failure, Lopez should fire her agent and start looking for smaller parts in less ""Hollywood"" productions. Movie audiences didn't buy J-Lo, media superstar, as an abused wife or cop and they might not buy this role either."
1,Enchanting and Insperational,"Ralph Fiennes is way to hot and old for J. LO. This is supposed to be a romantic comidy, but the ending is determined when the maid(J Lo) spots the senator(Ralph) they fall deeply in love and the to be senator who we know will of course win falls in love with the maid's overly perfect and politically correct son, who's only ten and loves Nixen. Anyways when the to be senator chris finds out beautiful yet we remember we're not supposed to judge her on her looks J. Lo is maid all he can say is ""oh"" and then there's an expression on his face as if he knows the movie is terrible and is a complete waste of time and talent."
1,Not Romantic,"One of the key ingredients for any romantic comedy is some kind of electricity between the stars. Jennifer Lopez andRalph Fiennes not only have no sparks, they are in movie that relies so heavily on formula that the formula seems more than ordinarily forced. For example, Jennifer Lopez's character has to go to a ""ball"" so she can seem like Cinderella, only she doesn't stay very long and nothing notable happens. Then, her ""Prince Charming"" chases after her and they wind up in bed. All the time Jennifer Lopez's character is being deceitful as to her true identity ... also a forced plot device. This movie attempts to create a modern take on an old classic ... that is, if the movie is actually attempting anything other than getting box office sales. There is no story. There is no romance. There is no magic. I cannot imagine anyone wanting to see this movie more than once; it is not worth having in your video or DVD library."
3,well,"The movie started out good, but the ending was so cheesy. Good film for the whole family to watch."
5,maid for greatness,I saw this in theaters and thought it was one of the most genuinely charming movies of 2002. I'm a big fan of Jennifer Lopez and think the only better actress for this role would be Julia Roberts. Ralph Fiennes did a great job. I just highly reccomend it.
1,Don't buy any DVD's from the UK,I purchased this DVD but it was from the UK and those DVD's do not play in the United States. They send me a replacement but it did not play because of a region error. Be careful when buying DVD's from Amazon.
1,Maid in Manhatten,I really enjoyed part of the movie. Halfway through movie it shut down and I could not load it without another $2.99 charge.
2,The Story Plot Really Badly Shamefully SUCKS!,"Got this movie because really was curious to see how J.Lo matching with Ralph Fiennes. The acting are so so but the story plot really badly shamefully sucks. J. Lo's hotel maid character is in fact a dishonest petty thief for she stole a rich hotel female guest's clothes and then went out with a VIP rich male hotel guest (Ralph Fien) for a date during her working hours. And.... Gee..... as that's not bad enough she even went as far as to sleep with that VIP male hotel Guest in his hotel room where she worked! The producer story writer of this film perceive such despicable behavior as some sort of daring courageous heroic class act. Don't they know there's something call ""bottom line"" which you don't cross?This movie shamefully glorifies a dishonest petty thief maid whom they think OK to cross all bottom lines to get what she want, even to steal and to lie. But what can you expect from Hollywood? They'll do anything if it sales."
4,A great movie,I would not say that this movie is one of the greatest movies around but i did enjoy it. It is a great movie for those of us that dream for something better or those of us that just want to watch a movie that would make you feel good afterwards.
4,Fairytale,"MAID IN MANHATTEN is a fun and cute movie that people will most likely enjoy. Jennifer Lopez plays Marisa, single mother and a maid at a posh hotel. She does anything her guests ask her to do, many errands, and cleans and such. One time with her co-working pal, she decides to try on these expensive clothes that one of her guests wants her to return. This is where Ralph Fiennes comes in as a famous politician who is swept away by her beauty and pursues her. She is conflicted between telling the truth about who she really is, or living out this fairytale with him. It's a humorous movie that is sure to make you smile, well paced and definately worth seeing. The acting is superb, Jennifer Lopez once again shines on the silver screen, and its refreshing to see Ralph Fiennes in a role like this, unlike any of his other roles. Think of this movie as an updated version of CINDERELLA. Overall it's a cute fun movie, definately worth viewing."
1,Artificially sweet and what an unoriginal storyline!,"This movie was so trite it was almost sickening. How many scenes can we be expected to watch that have obviously been engineered to showcase Jennifer Lopez's looks? She is not so beautiful that I want to look at her in every outfit from every angle the entire movie!I was so disappointed in the performance by Fienes (sp?). He is such a phenomenal actor - one has to wonder why in the world he would take such a soppy role and especially with such a cliched, stale script/storyline! UGH."
1,If this movie was a recipe...,"it would look something like this:- take your usual romantic comedy formula (if it worked before, why change anything, right?)- add an actor who is completely out of his usual genre, to add a taste of 'quality' to the film.- add an actress who can't act, but has an impressive behind (which can be used in jokes).- try to blend in some social issue - again, to add 'quality' - like issueto the movie.The result: 'Maid in Manhattean' - a boring, perdictable movie."
2,Stay Away From This Movie,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I rented it last week with my roomates because we enjoy chick flicks, but this was just painful. There are no funny moments in it and the story is such a TIRED ripoff of Pretty Woman. Even the fairy godfather Hector Elizondo and the corrupt Jason Alexander characters are copied in this movie (by Bob Haskett and Stanely Tucci respectively).The main problem with this movie is that the 2 leads, Lopez and Fiennes have absolutely no onscreen chemistry. Fieness makes an attempt to have the audience believe he is smitten with Lopez's character, but not once to we believe she has the slightest interest in him.I give this movie 2 stars however because the young actor who plays J Lo's son is absolutely adorable and steals every scene he's in. It's too bad the story couldn't center around him."
2,Cinderella In Manhattan,"The plot you have seen before in Disney's Cinderella, complete with midnight ""pumpkin"" suspense. There is a even a Bibbity Bobbity Boo-style dance scene, one of the best laughs of the show with a rotund black Flora energetically bopping about.Ed Asner as the dignified butler in a ritzy hotel steals the show every time he comes on.The child actor, Tyler Posey, as Ty Ventura, Lopez's son, did an excellent job of playing adorable child, tugging at the heartstrings without being overly saccharine.Best line in the movie:""Can you keep a secret?""""Yes.""""Well so can I.""The only time I burst out in guffaws was when Lopez did her makeover converting from an exceptionally attractive Sandra Bullock-style natural beauty to Audrey Hepburn in the My Fair Lady grand ball scene with makeup by Tammy Fae Bakker, that made it look as if she had an eye disease causing her eyelids to sweat profusely."
4,Living in that era,"I would have loved to live at that time...Wonderful book, a little goldmine of info.Only one reserve: Scott Fitzgerald at the beginning of the book made me wondering if he was to be there all through it. He & Zelda are not sooooo interesting. I would have prefered a better intro to the Flapper age.Nonetheless, book highly recommended."
3,Good book but format issues,"This book is well written and describes this era well, with a great perspective. It was very frustrating to read the Kindle edition however. There are a few error common throughout the text that a simple proofread would have picked up. I am not sure why publishers do not give Kindle editions the attention they deserve when it comes to proofing- there are frequent text and format issues in nearly every Kindle book I read- Flapper being one of the worst."
4,Read for college course on Scandalous Women in American History,"As a college student, I can easily say that Flapper is one of the most interesting history books I've had to read for a class. Zeitz manages to weave stories and histories into an incredibly fascinating book that I could not put down."
5,Great book about 1920s America -- a real page-turner!,"For anyone interested in learning more about 1920s America and the Jazz Age, this book delivers with as much style as the era. It reads almost like a novel, with fascinating historical vignettes about such figures as Coco Chanel and Clara Bow. It delivers a thorough and captivating review of the history of sexuality during a time of rapid transformation in our nation's history. Fascinating, and very well-written. A real page-turner! I highly recommend it."
5,Great overview of the 1920s.,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It tells an amazing story of the people who introduced America into the modern age, it covers everything from fashion, technology, and entertainment, as well as many other things. This book is not too lengthy or dull, it gets straight to the point. While reading it you almost feel like you are a part of the action."
2,Glorifies immorality,"Flappers were the strippers of the 1920s. They may be glorified today, sort of like women who wear burkas and prostitutes are alwasy glorified as being 'independent women...making their own way' but it is merely a big fallacy. These women arn't role models and the biggest problem with society is that we tell young girls this is the role model(this or a burka). For the young woman she is told ""the only thing that matters in you is your but, your eyes, your legs and how you can shake it"". Yes this was America in 1925, and...its is America today. The only difference is that today the academics also glorify the burka and the hijab. Yes, one thing changed...the music got worse.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,If You Understand and Like Martin And Will...,"Two of my favorite television shows were ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" and ""Martin"" so when ""Bad Boys"" came out I had to go see it. Although my opinion may be biased because I enjoy the comedy of both of the main characters, I can confidently say that Bad Boys is one of the better action/comedy flicks with considerable replay value. But as with most urban movies, if you do not understand or like Will Smith or Martin Lawrence's styles of humor, you are not going to like Bad Boys. END"
4,The Original!,"What can I say....Lights, camera and ACTION and LAUGHS! A great movie for a great price! The only reason I rated it one less star is that it comes automatically with american subtitles, so each time you want to watch it again (reload) you must go into the menu and turn the subtitles off, or actually it's already set to off, but you must click it.But for the price I can live with that!"
1,Loud and stupid,"I saw Bad Boys (not to be confused with Bad Boys starring Sean Penn and Esai Morales, which is a really good movie) and hated it. The movie was to loud, it was like watching a bad MTV video, and I find Martin Lawrence to be incredibly irritating. I know a lot of people will not care for my comments, but we are all entitled to our opinions. If you're looking for good cop/buddy movies, any of the Lethal Weapon entries blows away this film."
2,Not Good At All,This movie is boring and it [is bad] but a little (and I mean a little) action scenes are OK. The 1st time I saw this movie I thought it [was bad]. My brother buys the special edtion for a good price so he made me watch it again and it was too boring. So later my brother just keeps putting it on and he got sick of it and put it away. I can't believe they made this movie. I give this DVD 2 thumbs down way down. This movie is the worst Michael Bay movie ever. I can't believe they are going to make a Bad Boys 2 but if I see Bad Boys 2 I hope it will be way better than the first one. So please son't see or buy this movie you will be sorry if you see this movie. But you could rent it just to see how it is but you will be sorry.
1,a waste of film and money,"This is not even funny,maybe some rambo style action here and there but thats it.A film based on ignorance,no brains at all in this trash film,only hollywood making a quick dollar."
4,"BAD BOYS BAD BOYS, WHATCHA GONNA DO?","DRUGS ARE STOLEN FROM A POLICE EVIDENCE ROOM, AND TWO COPS [WILL SMITH AND MARTIN LAWRENCE] ARE ASSIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE REASONS BEHIND THIS. MARTIN LAWRENCE AND WILL SMITH MAKE A VERY GOOD TEAM. THIS MOVIE IS FUNNY AND IT HAS A LOT OF ACTION. A GREAT FILM TO WATCH IF YOU WANNA LAUGH AND SEE SOME ACTION. FOLLOWED BY A SEQUEL."
4,VICE redux,"Featuring Martin Lawrence, Will Smith and Tea Leoni, David (X-FILES) Duchovony's spouse, BAD BOYS manages somehow to be equal parts parody and tribute to MIAMI VICE, the 80's NBC ""MTV cops"" show. In some ways it goes its TV counterpart even better: Leoni is a much stronger female character than Gina and Trudy, VICE's lady cops, ever were allowed to be; and the two cops are both African-American (a rarity in what Spike Lee rightly called the racist ""Hollywood Plantation""). There's even a reference to VICE: the surname of Lawrence's characther is Burnett, which was Sonny Crockett's undercover alias. However, there are some differences: you don't see the uber-modern drug-lord's houses and apartments you saw on VICE---intstead it focuses on South Beach with its Art Deco buildings and the hideout of the villians is in a burnt out hangar. All in all, an interesting 90's update of VICE."
4,Don't be fooled by the following idiots!!!!,"The other critics on this page have to be total IDIOTS/GEEKS!!! ""Bad Boys"" is a great movie for everyone to watch. Although, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are/were comedians, they did an excellent job in the movie. The chemistry that the two shared made the movie even better. The sequel to the movie is even better than the first."
5,Awsome,"This is one of the best movies you will ever watch.It has everything,laughfter,sadness, and most of all action.the first time I watched it, I thoght it was awsome but the second and third time I watched it became one of my all time favroit movies because I understood it a little more. Will smith and Martin Lawrence (which are my favroit acters) were outstanding. I got this DVD about 3 weekes ago and Ive seen it about twnty times and Im still not bored of it. I have seen almost every movie for Will smith and Martin Lawrence and this is the best acting Ive seen from both. Best of all there both togeher and they make an awsome team."
3,A must for Tea Leoni fans,"This movie is a standard action/comedy flick, lots of explosions, car chases, shoot-outs and fist fights plus some good laughs. I don't like seeing films like that twice, but here I'll make an exception for Tea Leoni, I just love her looks and her deep sexy voice. For Tea Leoni fans this is MUST!"
2,Disappointing -- unless you are a Tea Leoni fan,"This movie depends heavily on the interactions between Martin Lawrence (amazingly thin!) and Will Smith. To my mind, their banter seems strained and not very funny. Will Smith is always worth watching, but Martin Lawrence is obviously trying to put his lines over by sheer force. To make a rather strange comparison, it kind of reminded me of some of the dialog in the later Marx Brothers movies: Delivered with gusto, but not, unfortunately, very funny. The plot is completely unbelievable and seems pretty much an afterthought. One bright spot: Tea Leoni proves that she has the best legs in Hollywood. Wearing some super-short skirts, she is definitely the best thing in the picture. Add two stars to my rating if you are a Tea fan. Add three stars if you have a big league crush on her."
2,Standard fare formula cop drama,"Nothing unique or original here. The family man cop and the loose canon ladies man cop bust the drug kingpin.A weak story with lots of over-the-top unrealistic gun fights.I expected some Profanity but when there is so much and it is used with such abandon, it becomes pointless. The rest of the dialog is composed of poorly done ""ghetto english"". 2 stars for the good photography work of Miami."
4,smith & lawrence make Bad Boys a blast,"if one is looking for an action/comedy, cop-buddy movie, this is the one. lawrence and smith are definitly very funny in this movie and you can tell they had a blast making it.this is micheal bay's movie directorial debut and he directs it with flash and style... there is energy and excitement in each of his shots. the plot is cliche, the story predictable, the characters are poorly defined. even bay admits the script wasn't the best. but its the performances turned in by the main actors and bay's visual style that makes what could have been a standard lethal weapon rip off into one hell of a fun movie.as a side note, mark mancina's score for this movie is among the best I've heard in an action movie. he has fast paced pieces for the action scenes and slow, beautiful music for the scenes involving emotions. without his music, Bad Boys would have been a little less enjoyable."
5,"Excellent cop ""buddy"" movie","Great casting, good dialogue, exceptional cinematography are tied up in a tight little bundle, the best cop ""buddy"" movie I've ever seen. It's not for kids, way too violent, but it's excellent adult entertainment. Will Smith is ultra-suave, Martin Lawrence provides the human side of the pair, and the disposable chick lead actually does rather well in her role.I'm not a great fan of cop movies or violent crime dramas, but I've got this on DVD and I watch it at least once a year. It's an unusually well-produced film for what it is."
4,Great action movie but.....TERRIBLE BLURAY conversion,"I've loved this movie since it came out in 1995. I have the original DVD and the special edition version. Sorry to say that the special edition regular DVD has better quality then the BluRay. I don't get why the movie companies aren't restoring/enhancing the movies before they transfer them to the blueray disc. These things cost almost 20.00 and I want my monies worth. I spent lots of money getting a nice HD TV, bluray player, surround sound system but if the movie isn't transferred right they all my hd equipment is useless. I've seen this movie on one of my DirecTv HD channels and the picture was way better then this BluRay disc.Pros:GREAT movieCons:Not digitally enhanced or restored. Normal DVD looks better!"
3,"""Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?""","Saw this on T.V. not long ago, and enjoyed it. I don't mind action flicks with humour, and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a good double act. It was funny, violent and 'Leathal Weapon-ish' and also starred the gorgeous Tea' Leoni (Deep Impact). I hear there was a sequel, but it flopped."
2,Not convincing,"A lot of action, but the little guy was miscast here, he may talk big & tough, but on 1st sight, i don't pay attention to his character"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GARBAGE.,This is a poor excuse of a movie.The plot was stupid and very boring.The stars of the movie are not believeable in their roles because they look silly and are comedians.The jokes were corny and lame.The action was okay but not very realistic.Im getting sick and tired of these black actors who like to act tough and give attitude only to appeal to a young audience who listen to hip hop.DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB MOVIE!!!
3,GOOD CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO LEADS AS FOR STORY IT FAILS,"WILL SMITH & MARTIN LAWRENCE PLAY TWO BICKERING COPS WHO INVESTIGATE A BURGARLY OF A POLICE WAREHOUSE FILLED WITH CONFISCATED DRUGS AND MONEY. THE MOVIE IS GOOD JUST AS ALONG AS SMITH & LAWRENCE ARE ON THE SCREEN THE MINUTE THEIR NOT THE FILM WONDERS INTO A COMPLETE STATE OF UTTER BOREDOM, WITH CORNY ONE LINERS AND ENDLESS FLOW OF MTV DANCE MUSIC. I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO DO A SEQUAL TO ""BAD BOYS"" BECAUSE IF THE PRODUCERS DO MAKE A SEQUAL IT WILL BE A ""BAD"" CAREER MOVE."
1,Absolute crap,"A friend lent this to me - after seeing a bit of it, I just skimmed through the rest to see the action sequences. I agree with all of the one star reviews. Bad acting, lame comedy, and even the explosions start to become boring. Crap all the way. Doesn't deserve even one star. Minus 100 stars, I'd say."
1,Oh a little balance please...,"Hard to believe the reviews praising this worthless rag. For me, the jokes arent funny save one or two, the story is incredibly stupid, and unbelievable, the acting is phoned in (Will Smith,shame on you.Your better than this), and most of all the editing sucks.Other than that I guess its a great movie.Bay turned in great works with ""Armageddon"",and ""Pearl Harbor"",but this one is a real stinker."
5,A better disc for a great movie,"What can I say about this movie, but the fact that Bad boys is one of my all time favourite films. It stars Will Smith (the Frensh Prince of Bell Air) and Martin Lawerance (Martain/Blue Streak) as two Miami cops, both are two very funny actors who took to the action role very well (of course Will Smith as continued on so in this role in films like ID4 and Men in black). The film produces great action and boasting good soundtrack(songs such as Shy guy) from the talents of a great director(This film really started Michael Bay's carear and is still one of his best).I know its not everyones cup of tea, but if you like your movies fast, sexy, loud and action packed buy the DVD now! This special edition had loads of extras."
4,Worth the Wait!!,Bad Boys was one of my favorite movies and I had been waiting forever for this to be available on Blu- ray. Action and comedy. Thanks Amazon for letting me pre-order.
3,Decent action pic,"So it ain't Shakespeare, but big deal? Lawrence and Smith make a fine combo, and Leoni is sooo sexy! Lots of good action and gags, replete with the trademark ""heroic shot from below in slo-mo of our heroes"". Entertaining to say the least."
3,"Save the money and go for ""Bad Boys Lite""","I am one of the biggest fans of Michael Bay ever to be. I eagerly anticipate each new movie and watch the e-shelves for new versions of his old movies. I hadn't owned my DVD player long before I bought ""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon Criterion Edition,"" and this film, ""Bad Boy Special Edition."" What really intrigued me about this DVD was the ability to use that angle button on my DVD remote.To start with, you have to go to a section named ""Damage Control"" in order to view scenes from multiple angles. Once you get here, though, you don't get ""scenes"" you get snippets of TVs and cars exploding. And it isn't very compelling.I haven't seen the normal version, but I can't imagine that the transfer quality is any better.I still love this movie, and on DVD it looks real nice. But, unless you have dollars to spare, don't waste it on the special edition. The extra just aren't worth it."
1,copycat,Isn't this book almost like Francis Ray's (I know who holds tomorrow) even the cover. This book came out in 2003 Francis Ray book came out in 2002. On each cover a lady is by a window and both ladies husband is killed and so is their mistress.
2,This book was all over the place,"I didn't like this book. The story was all over the place.First it was about Tracey losing her husband. Then it went to her sister and her problems. The book was about everything and everyone but Tracey, Travis, and their relationship. It took me forever to get into the story then I had to force myself to finish it. It wasn't worth my time or patience. I want my money back :^("
3,Skipped Through,The story held my interest for the first few chapters. Then it seem to come to an abrupt stop until you get to chapter 10. The mystery behind Tracey's husband infidelity is what kept me reading. But I did skip through a lot of the first chapters. I thought those chapters should have been filled with more clues to the reason behind her late husband's betrayal. That's what most people wonder about in this situation. Especially when the person isn't around to answer them.

3,OK PPV,"It seems to me that everytime WWE has a ppv in England, it ain't that good, I bought this dvd to add to my ever growing collection, it's not really worth having after I watched it."
4,The Kettles bring hillbilly humor to high class Paris,"At odds in Ma and Pa Kettle Back on The Farm, now the Kettles and their daughter-in-law's parents are friends and vacationing together in Paris. The delicate balance of social wit and screwball comedy that permeated classics such as The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle is back. It is worth noting that 3 of the best Kettle films, The Further Adventures of Ma and Pa Kettle, Ma and Pa Kettle Go To Town, and Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation, were the three directed by Charles Lamont. This is a classic Kettle film. While it isn't as smooth as the other two Lamont Films, this one is still a must see. Ma's reaction to the entertainment, and Pa's innocent involvement in a spy ring are among the highlights that this film has to offer."
3,Wilde is no Gorki nor no Brecht,"This rewriting of Romeo and Juliet is not convincing at all because the Nihilists are reduced to sectarian fanatics, the Czar to a manipulated tyrant, the courtiers to bloodthirsty powerhungry wolves, the Czarevitch to a romantic puppy suddenly grown adult. Vera, the most popular and feared Nihilist, will kill herself out of love to save the Czarevitch who is on a trail of reforms after the assassination of his father. This caricature has nothing to compare with Gorki?s The Mother, nor Brecht?s Mother Courage and Her Children. It is yet interesting to see how Oscar Wilde is far from understanding what simple suffering people can be in Russia at that time and what the psychology of the Nihilists was. He uses quite many clich?s and does not get into any depth. So the superimposing of a pale Romeo and Juliet ending does not give depth to something that is shallow.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"
5,His first play!,"What a joy to read Wilde's first play. Wilde took London by storm with his first commercially successful comedy, Lady Windermere's Fan. The combination of dazzling wit, social criticism, sumptuous settings and the theme of a guilty secret proved a winner, both here and in his next three plays, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband, and his undisputed masterpiece, The Importance of Being Earnest. But Vera is different, brilliant in its combination of Romeo and Juliet AND Macbeth - it really needs to be re-discovered! You won't regret reading this play, and this is a great edition too!"
3,"Some good, but weak plot in the middle and end","Other then Act III, most of the book is fairly cute and funny. There are a lot of interesting lines in the first part of the book through act II. Then the plot starts to suffer from ""dumb and dumber"" plot movements. I forced myself through act III, and found the end of the book not so bad, but not so good either. The beginning makes the book worth reading, and then you have to read the ending for closure. It is a relatively short work, so not a big loss, if you feel obligated to finish it. Definitely read up to act III."
5,You don't have to be Polish to enjoy it.,"This book is a thouroughly interesting history of the Polish ethnic community in eastern Winona, Minnesota. While most of the book concerns Winona and the people who gave the city the shining domes of ""St. Stan's"", it also places things into geographical and historical context by going back to the place in Poland where much of the community came from, and going west to some of the places settled by Poles who left Winona.If you are interested in the history of Winona, Minnesota, don't miss this one (even though Winona is not in the title). I'm not even Polish, and I found this book worthwhile."
5,"A relatively ""unknown"" SUPERSTAR...","Paul Carrack and I have been on the same page ever since I first heard him sing many years ago..His voice a pleasure and ""is music to my ears""..hahahaI never get tired of his songs and his voice is out of this world..."
5,A Very Meaningful Story,"""The Cat Who Went To Heaven"" is one of my favorite book. This is more to the story of painter and his good fortune. The story is about little cat that helps a poor artist to achieve greatness. I like this book very much because there sre beautiful and sweet poems in every chapter. The poems tell the reader the character's feelings, emotions, and details about the evens in the story. The book is only 70 pages and there are nice illastrations. I would like to recommend everyone read this story. This book not only give you joy but there are meaningful messages in this story that everyone should know."
3,Lovely little folk tale,"This story was a lovely little folk tale that reminded me of all the best of the Newbery books. A young man has been commissioned by the temple to paint a picture of Buddha as he blesses the animals. He slowly adds animals, telling the tale and the strength of each. Then the artist comes to the cat, an animal which had, by tradition, rejected the Buddha and thus was excluded from heaven. But it is the artist's cat that has inspired him in his work and the artist knows it is the cat's greatest wish to be included in the painting. At last, the artist makes the difficult decision to include the cat in the painting. The ending is surprising and lovely."
4,Life Changing Cat,"This tale of the cat has been around for decades, although I am not a cat lover or owner this story is filled with emotion, religion and the moral doing of a poor artist. I purchased this paperback book after reading that the house keeper brought home a cat instead of food for her hungry master. Although, he was upset ""Good Fortune"" would be involved in the happiness of this artist. The house keepers songs and my admiration for the black and white drawings give this book a more realistic meaning. This will be a great educational book for students in middle and high schools."
3,story as good as ever,I love this story but was disappointed in the quality of the overall book. I expected a hardcover and colored pictures and this was not the case.
5,A simple book of breathtaking beauty...,"This was my favourite book when I was a young child, and it has remained so ever since. A tale reaching across cultures and across ages, it is immensely tender, imaginative, and moving. This is one of the few books I can recommend with no caveat; read, delight, and save to savour again."
1,the cat dies? why?,It is incredibly sad and unnecessary for the cat to die!The fourth and fifth graders who have read it as a Newberyassignment at our school have not shared the enthusuasm for it that otherreviewers have expressed. It might better be used in high school as a spring board for discussion of Buddha mysticism. It could certainly be the basis for an interesting art assignment: paint an interpretation of the artist's masterpiece as Goatsworth describes it.
5,I first read this book when I was 7 and loved it then and even now at 36!,"I picked up this book at my school library when I was about 7 years old. Back then I read anything with an award sticker on the cover. Usually, I was guaranteed a good read. This book was sad and happy at the same time. I remember crying when I read it when I was little, and I even teared up now as an adult at 36. It's a bitter sweet story and it makes you appreciate the little things. I can't say exactly why I loved it except I did and still do. I think I appreciate that a children's book wasn't just about boogers or nonsense. So, if you want a good story pick this up. But the ending is very sad (and happy) but I don't recommend it for children who are too sensitive or very young."
5,Makes bad medications for your kitty go down easy!!,"I have discovered that VAL syrup is a godsend to mix with bad-tasting medications for cats, such as capsules that you need to open and put into liquid. Adding a small proportion of the VAl syrup instead of water makes the medication extremely palatable - then I add the additional quantity required with water (i.e. 10ccs needed, I will use 3 of those with the VAL syrup). This is the main way I use it and I never want to be without! I also gave some to a kitten experiencing shakiness and disorientation because of low blood sugar - got her over this condition very quickly, and back to normal."
1,Can't recommend it,"I can't recommend it. I give up after 78 pages. I was looking for an enjoyable, imaginative experience at the end of the day -- maybe an hour or so, but it was hard visualizing the scenes. I would stop, try to figure it out, then lose track of who was doing what and who was talking. I thought maybe it would eventually come together for me, but I became more frustrated. I thought my imagination was failing or I was adversely affected by a heavy work load, but I haven't had these problem with other writers. I finally decided the description is poor, and the style is jerky, disjointed -- distractingly annoying. A little ""he said, she said"" would have been very helpful and appreciated. Maybe the writer is great and I'm just a nut. Could be. Whatever. I'm taking it back to the library tomorrow and will try something else.Roger"
3,Kindle users beware,"This is the first book of a trilogy. The third book of the trilogy is available on Kindle but for some insane reason the second is not.When this (soon hopefully) is no longer the case, somebody please leave a note to that effect in answer to this review."
3,"Short, entertaining, but not adequate.","If you really care about the issues presented in this book, you'd better educate yourself with more in-depth books exploring them. I enjoyed the book and am very glad that it exists. My only misgiving is that it isn't nearly complete in it's arguments. Don't go fighting with someone that knows much more about the topics than you do after you read it. Especially regarding Home schooling, his arguments just don't stand up against my teacher parents, and several friends. That being said, the book is truly inspirational and completely worthy of a read, if only to help spawn your own ideas and get yourself excited about things."
4,good introduction,"This book is definitely entertaining and informative. The essay format allows Wimsatt to discuss all these different ideas and give the reader plenty to work with, and that is what they will have to do if any of these ideas hook them. Look into the books and resources Wimsatt provides and continue where he leaves off. Also, keep in mind that this book was written over ten years ago. Reading No More Prisons made me want to read Please Don't Bomb The Suburbs to see where his ideas took him and how these movements have changed.In his intro, Wimsatt said he wanted to write a book for people who don't normally read and I think he did."
2,cheerleading id difficult,"Dear people, Do U no how many people want to be cheerleaders? well u have to do ur best and sucess the things u want to do in ur life or u'll never make it ok cheerleading is difficult to learn! So remember to do ur best and try to be all u can be live up to ur dreams ok!!! then u'll have sucess to being a cheerleader!!!!"
3,"And so, Helmet died not with a bang, but with a whimper.","These songs were much, much better live. I don't know whether to blame Dave Sardy for producing the album, or Page for allowing Dave Sardy to produce the album."
2,"Disappointing follow-up to ""Betty""","""Meantime"" set up Helmet as an ingenious bunch of grungy thrashers ready to make an impact on the music scene. ""Betty"" showed power, craftmanship, and versatility. And now, on the verge of coming out guns blazing and shaking the foundations of alt rock, Helmet offers the limp, unsatisfying ""Aftertaste"". Technically, it's a perfectly acceptable album with plenty of their patented heavy, fuzzy grooves and hooks. But, altogether it's just a one trick pony. It tries way too hard to please. I wouldn't call it a sell-out album, but it gets too old too quickly. It's kinda like how when you've seen one episode of ""CHiP's"", you've seen 'em all. No matter how much you like seeing cops with shades on motorcycles."
5,Prescient Songs,"I am listening to this album now. I have owned it since it came out and always thought that it was panned by idiots. The 'swing' feeling in the syncopation of Helmet compositions was best employed on this album. 'Meantime' was great, but a few songs went on too long (e.g., ""turned out""). The lyrics of this album, not always Page's strongpoint, were the best ever composed in all albums to date, especially the before its time ""Driving Nowhere"", which I am suprised hasn't been used and written about and reevaluated given the political incarnations the West has encountered with the Middle East and the peak oil issues (not to mention it has the most balls out guitar solo of any rock song in the last 25 years)."
4,Good Helmet record,"This is a fine album.. I bought it right after I bought 'Meantime'.. at first I didnt really like it because it sounds nothing like 'Meantime' does.. it sounds... flatter. Anyhow, it's got some f*king amazing songs on here.. ""Like I Care"" is one of them.. ""Renovation"".. and.. my absolute favorite on here is ""Torn Exterior"".. that song will pummel your ass to the ground.. it's HEAVY.. the only real heavy song on here and it's great. ""Torn Exterior"" is a prelude to the new Helmet sound on 'Size Matters'. Yes, I have 'Size Matters' already (todays date: 9/6/04) one month before release. Anyway, 'Aftertaste' really is worth listening to."
4,great kid boot,Good Rain boot for my kids! easy on-off and durable quality! Great tread so slipping on the snow is minimal
2,Why Did They Bother,"Boring. No warning of what it might be like. Could of been a segment on the Twilight Show.If you just want to look at a tv show, it's ok."
3,AVERAGE AT BEST,"this sister group was originaly called heaven sent.the oldest sister had a solo album out way before this group formed.wich i think didn't go no where.but this album flopped misserably hopefully they will get another chance for a follow up.this album was just bland.its like just typical urban r&b music,with above average singers.plus it sounds a lil TOO adult contemperary popish for me in some areas of this cd.that part of the album probably was the idea of the oldest sister.wich is no suprise sense her solo album from way back when was VERRY adult contemperary.and was indorsed by none other then the anti urban music man himself tony motolla.its sad,or good depending on how you wanna look at it about what jaimee foxworth is doing now,compared to what she was doing.remember she was on the family matters sitcome.but then they written her out over budget disputes with her parents.so thats why judy winslow dissapeared."
5,Had this CD before,"Feeling somehwat nostalgic and wanted to replace a previous CD. Got it on the cheap, yeah baby! ! ! !"
2,not very sturdy,"The product broke within the first week of owning it. The assembly process was easy and simple, but maybe too frugal."
5,Nothing Better,"I have been using this product the last two winters and haven't found another moisturizing product that comes close to working as well as this one. Dry itchy skin, particularly on the lower legs, that plagged me during the dry winter months is no longer a problem. I recently shipped some to my mother in Maine who also suffered every winter and she is amazed at how well this works.Olay Moisturinse In Shower Body Lotion W/ Aloe & Vitamin E for Sensitive Skin Unscented 15.2 FL oz."
2,Sturdy rucksack. Will MURDER your back.,"I purchased this bag for a medium pack for camping. While the material of good quality and the bag holds up nicely, the shoulder straps attach in an A-design near the top of the bag, verses a H-design found on most backpacks. The problem with this is that weights in excess of 7 lbs will pull on your neck muscles in a spreading manner unless you loosen the straps, at which point the bag pulls back on your shoulders vs. downward like it should. Long story short, it will feel like you've been packing 30 lbs for 4 hours within 20 minutes of hiking. No padding on the shoulder straps also have it rub into your skin in a less than comfortable manner.As much as I like the durability of canvas, I would not recommend this pack.While it costs a good penny more, I would highly recommend theSnugpak Rocket Pak System,. Its much better for extended excursions into the wilderness and an awesome bug-out-bag if you're looking for one."
2,Get Something better for a little more,Took this along on a hike around downtown New York city...big mistake.My biggest complaint is the shoulder straps are stitched far too close together at the top.They are also thin and without padding.Do not waste your money here on this item.Spend an extra $30 and get something that is at the least comfortable to lug around for an extended time period.
3,bag is ok,This bag is ok. I bought it to be used as a bookbag. Not a good choice for a bookbag for my teenager. Straps take to long to buckle and unbuckle. One of the metal clasp fell off the first time I tried to buckle it. Ended up giving the bag to my husband to carry hunting supplies in.
3,"Good build and size, but not a practical bag.","This bag was supposedly the same bad I saw in urban outfitters for forty dollars. I bought it thinking I would save twenty bucks so I did.The only thing I realized was that this bag isn't suitable for walking to work and on the subway, because access to compartments is difficult to get in due to the belt clips.This product is great, it's just not what I needed it for."
1,Backpack,"No good! The straps do not like to hold, its not logical to use for anything more then holding clothes in. I wish it had had been better."
4,Big Big Big,Much bigger than it looks. I could not carry it as it would hit by bottom. Good for me my husband being of decent height did well with it. It hold everything but the kitchen sink. I washed it in the machine and it did pretty well. I didn't find the straps to be an issue.
4,A good pack,"I've made a few adjustments on this pack, more for my own taste as opposed to what the pack needed. this is a very nice sturdy canvas pack. i added a key ring to the shoulder strap to make it easier to clip my GPS to it. i also replaced the drawstring with equal length of para cord and a plastic cinch stopper. just in case. i use this pack for when i mess around in the bush/woods. i also use it for overnight trips too."
2,Made in China,I ordered this item one year ago it was great. But now it is made in China with poor finish. At this price this is not the quality that one can expect.
2,Nah,"In the beginning I thought that she introduced too many characters. There were really only a few characters in the storyline towards the end. The suspense really picked up in the last couple of chapters, but it couldn't hold my interest through the whole book, due to too many people and not enough intriguing storyline."
4,For Sue Grafton and Janet Evanovich fans,"I have read most of Lawrence Sander's books and enjoyed them all (except for The Marlowe Chronicles). The Eighth Commandment is a little different and a welcome deviation from his other New York detective and Archie McNally themed books. Also, if you are a Sue Grafton fan and have read all of her's and looking for something similar, try this one."
3,A below par Sanders book,"If you have read other books by L. Sanders you will be disappointed by this one.It is a sub par book on a flaky detective, with too many repetitions and not much of a plot. The suspense is there but it is not regarding the detective work (the thief is evident from the start and I kept wondering on the negligence of the detectives) it is actually in the romance.If you want a flight book, you can buy this one, but almost any other book by this author will be better."
3,Warning!,"I was disappointed to find that this book contains exactly the same material as Ramachandran's other book, ""A brief tour of human consciousness."" I'm not sure why the same material was published twice under two different titles.Also, if you're interested in Ramachandran's research, I would recommend instead his 1999 book ""Phantoms in the Brain."" It contains a lot more material, much of which is duplicated in the Reith lectures."
3,Immitation is the Sincerest Form of Flatery,The thing that bothered me about I DREAM OF MICROWAVES is the same thing that I liked about it. You just can't get past the point-by-point way it follows the same story as MY FRACTURED LIFE. On the one hand this is what I enjoyed about it because it does cover the same territory so it was familiar to something I already enjoy. However it was also bothersome in some ways because I wanted something more than the main character being turned into a middle easterner and renamed after a basketball player. It is a nicely written book. I did enjoy it. However I did not enjoy it as much as MY FRACTURED LIFE because it didn't seem to add as much to the story as I would have liked.
1,PRETTY SILLY,"Not a serious book about sexual terminology. Most of the terms from Aah to Zipper are familiar and the definitions given are more silly than informative. OK for a teenager, but if you are a serious adult, look elsewhere. Even if you are not a serious adult, there is funnier stuff out there."
2,What was I expecting?,"If you like Norah Jones, then you will probably like this CD. If you don't like her, like me, then there is little chance that you'll like this CD.I borrowed this CD based upon the Cure Cover ""Just Like Heaven"" that she did. While I like her mellow, sultry version of that song, it's really that song that hooked me in, not her music in general. ""Nine Million Bicycles"" is OK too, but the rest, forget it. It's all indistinct background music, although if you pay closer attention to the lyrics it holds more water. The rest of the CD is way too quiet and sleepy. Or, if you are a fan of this type of music, you could just call it mellow and laid-back. It's all in your point of view.If this CD was broken up by some more energetic, poignant music, then it might be good, but it's not: it's one long, drab, sleepy, acoustic-guitar mess. Buyer beware."
4,"""Engineered by Steve Sale..."" ...and CLIPPED...","All songs are excellent!But,... there are just too many treble boost (aural excitation?) in vocal and mastering. The '80s style reverberation is not colorless. Too aggressive loudness maximization is applied which introducing 3rd harmonics, causing me a hearing fatigue after few hours long play....Oops... Opened by Sound-Editors and you will observed that a lot of audio portions from many songs are.... CLIPPED! (Most severe in ""I cried for you"" 2m24s: ""How F-R-A-G-I-L-E the world can be..."")Mr. Sale should know what I mean. Hope that a re-mastering edition will be available in future (CD, HDCD, SACD, DVD-Audio...) Then I will buy again. And this is the reason why I write this review! Mr. Batt and Mr. Sale, please!!!Still highly recommended. Don't wait for the remastering anyway."
3,A few nice songs,"One or two good songs. Shy Boy is especially nice, in the same vein as Shivaree, sort of a lusty, soulful jazz pop, though nmot as sophisticated. Too many songs are maudlin'. She needs more songwriting help, more upbeat numbers. The recording is okay. Actually, I think the sibilance is natural, and is the result of not enough processing. Those who aren't Hi-Fi'ers won't care. The majority of us listening on Low-Fi IPod systems won't notice obviously. Some audiophiles will cringe with every ""Ssss..."" Again, the songs are not as interesting as Shivaree's ""Who's Got Trouble""."
1,Pastiche by pastiche,"I saw that she was compared to Norah Jones and hoped that she would be better than that over-rated singer. Unfortunately, she is worse. The songs lyrics are trite and pretentious. The backing music is so bland and dispirited it hurts. I had to turn the cd off after about track 8. It won't get another listen."
4,Like Marilyn M??,"I just listened to the track ""Blues In The Night"" and all the comparisons I am reading about are interesting to say the least (other than: why do we have to compare all the time?) Norah Jones Eva Cassidy...etc and then it dawned on me - she has the timbre and spreads the sense with the breathy vocals just like good ole Marilyn used to do. I have to admit I have not heard other recordings yet, let alone anything LIVE. Now, dont get me wrong I am not reducing Katie to ""simple"" erotic vibes - but I do think it is an essential part of her performance. Anyhow I think she is orginal in her one kind and that makes her special and worth 4 stars. ENJOY!"
4,Katie Melua,"For me her lyrics leave something to be desired. However, my most musical of three daughters, in her thirties, took to her right away"
4,Piece by Piece,"Piece by Piece~ Katie Melua is a very good album that I picked up just by pure chance. I did not know who this woman was at all and therefore this album was definitely a pleasant surprise. Ms. Melua has tremendous vocal skills and writes descent enough lyrics. The problems with the lyrics is that they become a bit meandering and she seems a bit happy to go on and on which can get a bit tiresome. The best song is without a doubt her cover of the stupendous and astounding cure track just like heaven. The book-let is really well made and the photos are top of the line. Now do not get me wrong, I really like the sound and the vibe of the album. Ms. Melua has vocal skills that can be comparable with some of the best in the business. However with a more strict text editor her songs could have become even better. Still and all this is a very good album that gets the 4 out of 5 stars that it rightly deserves."
4,What's this! A pop Artist that Can Actually Play an Instrument!,"....and sing! I had all but given up on pop music when I heard ""9 Million Bicycles"". Piece By Piece is what pop music should be - well executed, sincere, pure, not relying on gimmicks and flash. Other great tracks are a sweet, accostic cover of the cure classic ""Just Like Heaven"" and Thank you Stars."
4,Incredible...,"This follow-up to ""Call of the Search"" will be a wonderful addition to any music collection. Melua has been rightly compared to Norah Jones for her jazz vocalist sound and the way her voice blends seamlessly with her music. I think another apt comparison is to Sarah Bettens, the lead singer of K's Choice who released her own solo album. I would go ahead and single out particular songs, but the cd is solid all the way through and is the kind of thing you can put into your cd player and let run over and over again. If you buy this cd, you won't be disappointed."
5,Saturday afternoon at the movies,"The Durango Kid series is among the best of the cowboy movies from the 1950s. Fifty + years later, it is still a great movie to sink back with your favorite popcorn and be transported to a time when the bad guys ALWAYS lost and the good guys ALWAYS won."
3,Corrupt Town boss vs the ranchers,"In this Durango Kid yarn,Durango(Charles Starrett)goes to a small town to clean it up. 0ne brother,a judge is blackmailed and handled by his evil brother ,thus corrupting the town and letting outlaws run the town and -- the good folks out."
3,Not the best of Nora; but fun to read overall,"Nora Roberts fans will likely find this book a bit disappointing; I did. Ms. Roberts spent a lot of time on describing the setting and not enough on character or plot development. The long-winded descriptions of flowers, with their species details, were boring. The characters were uncharacteristically flat and hard to care much about. There were no surprises in the story. In fact the plot twists felt tired. BUT, this book is still a decent read. Its mainly good fun. Some Nora Roberts books are so good one wants to re-read them. Not this. Read, enjoy in the moment, then pass it on to someone else."
3,Blue Dahlia,"Ms. Roberts is one of my all time favorites. The queen of romance yes but this one is a dud in my eyes...I couldn't even finish it. I suppose, I'm tired of her direction to take storylines into the mystic world of ghost and goblins. It gets tired after awhile...please bring back storylines like ""Honest Illusions"" (the first book I ever read by her)"
1,Using the same formula- unsuccessfully this time,"Nora has a regular formula she uses in all her books, most times the stories are interesting enough that you don't care they are really canned formulas, but this attempt- I had to force myself the finish this trilogy. Also- was so sickening the way every alternate page one of the characters would start crying, emotion is great in moderation.Worst book of Nora Roberts ever."
1,Blue Dahlia,"Fortunately, I only spent 5.95 on this $7.99 book. I spent$5.00 more than I should have. It is almost like it is notNora Roberts writing. I was very disappointed as I was with the""Key books"". Don't waste your time or money. What happened tonovels like she used to write....Montana Sky, etc.?"
4,"For Nora, a little disappointing","For anyone else, this would not be a bad book. For Nora, I have to agree that it's a little flat. I never flip ahead in a Nora book...until this one when I was trying to see when the action would pick up a little. The reviewers who said that this would've been much better as one book lihe ""Three Fates"" were right on target. It seems like parts of this book 1) had no editing, and 2) were just in there to fill the story out to book size. Also, I have to disagree that the Key series marked a stylistic change, seems like a deepening of the trend begun in the Ardmore and Three Sisters series to me. Hopefully the rest of the series will pick up. Fellow Noraholics, please remember that the first Key book was slower than the other two; new fans, read this one, but go back and hit the Ardmore and Three Sisters series too. Everyone - get yourself the Nora Roberts Companion for Christmas, a must for any Roberts fan."
2,Not Her Best,"I have to agree with the others, this isn't one of Nora's best. It's not even researched that well, she writes about what a beautiful spring it is in Tennessee, and not once does she mention the red bud trees. You can't help but notice them when they bloom, the hills turn red-violet. The love story was flat. However, the supporting characters were not too bad."
3,Blue Dahlia,"I know that Nora Roberts is capable of less predictable stories than this one. But while the distraught and angry ghost is interesting in a Romance novel, it does not rescue this novel from following a predictable formula plot from start to finish. It is prudent for me to add that given a choice of Romance authors to read, Nora is my first choice so I was relieved to find the third book in this set to be more up to her plot creation and character development caliber."
1,Far from her best book,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I own just about every one she's ever published. It took me a month to plod through this one, and I did not enjoy it at all. It got bogged down in the details of gardening and family history. The Reader's Digest Condensed version of her writing here would be much preferable! I own the next two, but won't be even trying to read them, much as I really do love her stuff.Instead, I recommend the MacGregor series. They're all fabulous!"
4,Blue Dahlia,"This was the first book in this trilogy and although it was pretty good, it wasn't my favorite of the 3. It's entertaining, however, and definitely worth reading so that you can get to the rest."
5,It's a page turner!,"I like to have books to lose myself in and this book does that. Also, the Trilogies are great, when you are not ready for the story to come to an end."
2,A Little Flat,"I am usually a huge Nora Roberts fan, but this one fell a little flat. I appreciate an author who has a talent for descriptive writing, and can make you almost ""feel"" the setting of the book. That is one of my favorite things about Nora Roberts. However, has anyone else besides me noticed that many sentences in the book start with the word ""and""? It's starting to drive me crazy! Enough already!!"
2,Two Stars,"The magic of Nora Roberts's writing is even if you know nothing about things (glass art from Born in Hot and making boats), she writes them in a way that you feel like you know about glass art or other stuff and she can paint such a vivid picture of the city or town her stories were set, I felt completely lost Blue Dahlia. I have no idea what half of them were talking about in the book when they talked about flowers and gardening and I never felt like I was in Memphis. The same with Stella and Logan, where was the romance? Most of the time they weren't together and when they were it was flat. I hope Black Rose will be better."
3,She's written better,"It's Nora Roberts book so of course the character development is really good, but I basically agree with the other reviewers in that the romance between Logan and Stella is kinda boring and flat. The other characters are interesting though, and I see potential for the rest of the trilogy...especially since the only character I don't really care for is the [...] Stella. Hopefully the romance is a little more inspiring next time."
4,Big Fan,I love Nora Roberts and i did enjoy this book. I can't wait for the others to come out. The only thing thats bad is waiting so long for the other to come out and you kind of have to go back to the first book. Other then that keep up the good work!!!!
4,Definitely not a stinker,"Nora Roberts has very few stinkers, and this one was in the majority and therefore NOT a stinker. Generally, I liked the story and I loved the characters. The scenery wasn't quite as rich in this novel as in the previous ones I've read of hers, but it was nice all the same.My only real objection was that the romance didn't start until about halfway through the book. Heck, we didn't even meet the hero until about a third into the book. I wanted more romance, and a little less about the supporting characters. After all, they're going to get their own books. So I thought Stella and Logan's story sort of got the short end of the stick, and now Roz and Hayley's books are going to be better.But don't knock her, Nora Roberts is still the reigning queen of romance."
5,Great first Nora Roberts book,"I purchased this as my first Nora Roberts book and just fell in love with the scenery and the characters. I felt like I was one of them. I liked it so much that I had a hard time putting it down, and that rarely happens!! I usually take forever to get through a book but this wasn't one of them. The is a good book if you are just getting into Nora Roberts' books. I loved it so much I immediately went out and bought the other 2 in the series!!"
5,Another Nora Hit,"I thoroughly loved this book. She's a super author. I couldn't wait to start number two in the series. Love the ""spooky"" side of the book. Kept your interest peeked all the way through."
3,Blue Dahlia,I prefer a little more mystique in her books.. this one did not hold my interest as others have.
4,Best dialogue of any Nora book,"Of all the Nora trilogies I have read, this one had the snappiest dialogue. Nora's characters always have distinctive dialogue, but I thought this book had the most interesting conversations. The little boys and stepmother Jolene are so charming!Great story and characters. I would only ask that Nora put more descriptive detail in. The Key trilogy was very lacking in this regard, which made the story harder to read, although I imagine this was done to make the story easier to read. For the right amount of descriptive detail, I like Nora's Irish trilogies. It gives the story more ""oomph""."
3,First Book,i really did not like this book at first but then i got into it and had the buy the next 2 in the trilogy
1,Blue Dahlia,"I read this book to please our Book Club leader. I guess I'm just not a Nora Roberts fan. There is absolutely no substance to this book. Boy meets girls. Fall in love. Live happily ever after. And, oh, by the way, there's a ghost in the attic. SIGH"
3,Mehh.,"I am a big Nora Roberts fan. This trilogy was not her best work. She's come back with a vengeance though -- her 2012 ""The Witness"" was brilliant."
2,Dull,"Nora Roberts seems to be dragging out this one. Other than Harper Bride Ghost, the other characters are just plain predicatable. 2 ** for the Harper Bride Ghost for sending chills down my spine. Otherwise, I couldn't wait to get to the end just to see how the story goes. And then the ending felt sudden and disjointed. Unstatisfactory read."
2,OK Book,"This book was recommended to me by a friend. As far as paperback romances go, it was OK. I read it quickly and will probably not pick up the other two in the series (Black something and red something, both flowers). Protagonist is a gardener...not really my thing, but OK book."
5,relief for cough and sore throat,"I hate using regular cough syrup, which tastes terrible and makes me loopy. This product is a great alternative. It has a wonderful rooty smell and contains eucalyptus, which soothes coughs, breaks up nasal congestion and eases sore throat. Thankfully, I don't get sick very often, but when I do I use Crystal Lungs three times a day."
5,A Very Satisfying Read,"This book is an terrific introduction to the details and applications of networks. Having only a superficial notion of what networks were about beforehand, I could hardly put it down. It was mind expanding, and will surely broaden your thinking!"
4,Lightweight heavyweight,"Buchanan seems to be a lightweight in this field. The big names are people like Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz, but their books are barely readable. Buchanan writes an interesting book and makes it compelling for the layman. In fact, I have read it twice."
4,Six Degrees of seperation.,"Actually, I bought this book with the intention of reading about genetics algorithms although I was pleasantly surprised with the out come of the book.The book is about how our large world is small and what seems chaotic is actually an organized small network.The author starts with how networks in nature relate to networks in technology. A very strong case for ""6 degrees of separation"" for our society and ""19 degrees of (link) separation"" for the Internet. The rest of the book explains with historical examples how scientists were able to prove the networking concepts through human decision and thought process.I gave this book 4 star because I did not think that the conclusion had the continuity of the other chapters. I would recommend this book to all individuals who would be interested in reading and understanding the connections and influences of nature in our ""connected"" world.Have fun understanding that you closer then you think to the person next door."
2,"Not bad, but could be a lot shorter as it feels like it lacks focus","I was interested by Mark Buchanan's work because of the understanding that it promised for networks. Buchanan does a good job at simplifying scientific theory in a similar to James Gleick at the start of the book and it certainly provides food for thought. However, the book could be a third shorter if the editors had cut out the Malcolm Gladwellesque detours which add no value to the books central premise. I'd advise you to save your money and move on."
3,Forgettable introduction,"Buchanan introduces the study of networks in a competent and workmanlike fashion, but ultimately does little to either inspire or unify. The book comes across as series of anecdotes, like Gladwell's more timid cousin. Buchanan casts a wide net to cover epidemiology, neuroscience, ecology, economics, genomics, and more, but ends up telling the reader very little about these subjects, other than that they are all complex networks sharing underlying similarities. At the end of the short read, the reader is left thinking ""network theory sounds pretty cool - I wish I could learn something about it""."
2,Extremely frustrating,"The subject that Mark Buchanan addresses is, in itself, significant and fascinating. And Mr. Buchanan knows his stuff. He provides excellent visuals and thorough notes that many readers will find useful.Why, then, do I find it so frustrating? Simply put, Mr. Buchanan may be a first-class editor, but he is not a very good writer. Not that he can't write a grammatical sentence. He just has trouble structuring one that leads unambiguously from one idea to another.Thus, as interesting as I find the subject, it took me three years to force myself to finish the book. I am quite willing to reread something if, ultimately, I learn it. But I hate to be fighting constantly with the writer, trying to understand which of three possible concepts he's trying to convey.And then there's the minor annoyance of the cover stock (paperback edition). It was curling before I left the bookstore, and it will never uncurl."
1,Not text to speech enabled...,If you have a Kindle and use your text-to-speech to listen to your books beware: this is not text enabled. Very disappointing. Buchanan's other works are great introductions to complex issues and a great starting points for serious research... while I understand this was most likely not Mr Buchanan's choice it is still frustrating.
