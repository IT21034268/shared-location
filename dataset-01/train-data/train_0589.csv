1,This book is horrible!!!!,"So many typos I can't stand reading it. Don't waste your money unless you like trying to figure what is ""meant"" rather than what is written. Terrible!"
2,Smell was off-Maybe I got a bad batch,The smell was really off. I had to spray extra perfume to compensate. I will stick with the lotions that I find in the stores. I will make sure I buy multiple containers.
1,small book,"I am disappointed in the size of this book. I buy art books mainly to see examples of art. The images are too small and low resolution. It is good enough for a quick history book, but not for a curious artist. This book would get lost under one magazine if it were on a coffee table."
1,False picture,"I give this item one star because of the deceptive picture that is provided. The picture shows a bird sitting on a perch that clearly appears to be connected to this toy. There is NO perch! Also there is no means to hang the toy - the loop shown in the picture is just that, a loop. You'll need to come up with some means to attach the loop to the cage. Other than the deceptive picture and the lack of a means to hang the toy it seems nice. If I were a bird I think I'd enjoy picking at it."
3,Potential entanglements,"While my parrots enjoyed shredding this product, one got her footentangled and had to be freed. Their are other products, such asnutcase, that give parrots fun and exercise w/o the risk."
3,They're plain but do the job,"These are just thin cotton gloves that are not particularly tight. In fact I wish they were tighter because they slide off my hands. I'd prefer a tighter, maybe slightly stretchy pair of gloves that felt a bit thicker."
1,disclose the contentÂ¡,What about disclosing the number of FCC units per tablet?. This is not established in any brand name that I checked in amazon and it is the only way to compare the cost.
1,THE PRODUCT IS WRONG,"Hi.I order the Lactaid Original Strength Lactase Enzyme Supplement, Caplets - 120 eaBUT WHEN THE BOX ARRIVED HERE, THE PRODUCT INSIDE WAS WRONG.What was sended to me, the product inside the box is: LAC-HYDRIN FIVE MOISTURE LOTION.I REALLY HOLPE THAT THE SALLER DO THE CHANGE FOR THE RIGHT PRODUCT.LUCIANA MELO"
4,Addressing the Prophetic,"I thought the handling of this issue was done very well. Pastor Randles was able to address the biblical perspective on the gift of prophecy, without having to base his arguments in philosophy or subjective experience. For those involved with the Kansas City movement, or were involved with the Latter Rain movement, this will give you a new perspective on how these so called ""prophets"" stand up to the test of scripture."
5,Both informative AND entertaining!,"Most 'how to' videos/DVDs can be incredibly boring. Not this one! I have some knowledge on filmmaking but this documentary was very informative, I learned quite a few new things and it had some great humor to boot! Definitely a 'must own' DVD for anyone who's interested in film making! I think this would be a great tool for film making schools/colleges."
1,How NOT to make a DVD,I would have thought that a DVD on film making would have reasonable production values but was sorely disappointed when I purchased this item. The content is very poorly presented and most of the chapters are nothing more than badly assembled lists. There is a lack of quality interviews and the overuse of 'tacky' animation effects and cheesy voice overs really distracts from the few worthwhile points of interest.One of the interviews on the Grand Canyon also has such bad sound quality you can barely understand what the person is saying.
2,The shell that bombed,"There is no question that Uschi has the buxom figure and her misson of comparing the sex activities in Copenhagen to that of San Francisco could excite most male drives. For those who are expecting a lot, your expectations will most likely become mundane realizations. You know the type: If you have seen one you have seen them all."
2,"*Yawn* Sorry, I was expecting something else.","After reading Gerritsen's amazing medical thrillers, I decided to go for her earlier books. All I can say is... *Yawn* Although many people might find this story interesting and romantic, I find it awfully cliched, and the characters are too two-dimensional.If you just read one of her medical thrillers and you're expecting the same fast-paced page-turning experience here, look elsewhere."
5,Good mystery,This book is not the typical story for ms Gerritsen. Usually her books are in the medical field. This is way off that track. this is a story of a woman who's parents were killed 20 years ago. She recently discovers that there is more to their deaths then what she was told. She flys to Paris for answers. Now someone is out to kill her and her brother. Some secrets aren't meant to be known. A lot of twists and turns and hard to figure out who the bad guy/gal is.
4,Another Early Work By A Very Talented Author,"As previously stated by another reviewer this title is much different then the medical thrillers that we are used to by this author. This title was orignially published back in 1995 and the storyline is really a spy/suspense/romance tale that is fast paced and demonstrates that Ms. Gerritsen was well on her way to becoming the author that she is now.This read will take the reader from England to Paris, then on to Greece, and finally Berlin. The chemistry between Richard Wolf and ex-CIA agent and Beryl the young woman that is trying to figure out who killed her parents and why is really believable but at the same time this relationship did not detract from the spy storyline. Do yourself a favor and pick up this read. You won't be sorry."
3,Fluff Stuff.,"I must admit that I was expecting a new Tess Gerritsen novel, so I was a bit surprised to find that this one is a re-issue of one of her earlier works. It bears little resemblance to the the author's later medical/crime dramas. The writing is just ok, and the author never really achieves that level of tension and drama that we are used to. The romance often falls into cliche and had me rolling my eyes often at some pretty tired lines. The plot is pretty straightforward with not a whole lot of mystery, and once again the author relied on some pretty tried and true plot devices to move her story line along. The characters were mostly stereotypical and lacked dimension. It's an OK, very quick read if you are just looking for a bit of fluff to occupy your time. If you are seeking something more, pass this one by and head off to some of this author's later works. This one reads like a beginner's effort - which it probably was. Not a recommend."
5,excellent,favorite obscure album aside from the album oriented radio set lists that never gets airplay on either current of classic rock stations
3,Review from a Slade fan,"In the early 1970's Slade was the band that converted me to rock and pop music. Ever since then, I bought their seven singles and/or LP's of which ""Nobody's Fools"" was one. After vinyl disappeared, I bought Slade CD's selectively and mainly their Greatest Hits. Nobody's Fools is not one of their greatest albums but in particular, I like 2 of the catchy sing-a-long songs which is great to play at parties. I also play in a gig band were we will do these songs to create atmosphere and get the crowd involved to sing-a-long. The 2 songs are ""I'm a talker"" and ""Did your mama ever tell ya"". You can't help tapping your feet and get a smile on your face."
3,Buyer Beware,Exactly what I expected but beware. The item I received was used and I think I bought it as new. I found a name tag that belonged to someone else glue to the inside of the camera case. Make sure you know what the condition is before you buy an item.
4,A mixed bag,"The good news is your child can simply pick which game to play and even the level to play it at, the bad news is that they get stuck on the paint game which is not very challenging once the controller is mastered, but endless, mindless fun. The other games require knoledge of letters, numbers and some simple reading skills. The game doens't teach at all, but it does ofer reinforcement and practice. A good game to play together, the animated sequences where and unexpected surprise that help draw the child in."
4,I hope these last,"The first time I washed it, there were bathtubs worth of discolouring. The water was flowing deep red, so I soaked them through well. The second time around it was much less of an issue.These towels are very comfortable, and absorb quite well.I've had it for three months now and after each use, there are loose fibers all over the place (very literally). It hasn't affected use so far (except the additional cleaning up) but if the rate of fiber shedding continues, these can't last past a year.These are machine washable without any issues. Good price."
2,Not Very Absorbent,"Towels look good, feel good... can't absorb water though... feels like you're pushing the water around on your body as you towel out of the shower! We've washed and dryed them several times to ""break"" them in... still no better. We use them as a floor towel in the bathroom now!"
2,Five stars till I washed them (Buttercup color),"My first impression, I thought these were great towels -- they were large, heavy and soft. But I have to agree that for some reason, they just don't seem to absorb moisture as well as other towels I have in my home.But the real disappointment is the first time I washed them, they lost so much of their color. I started out with bright, colorful (Buttercup) towels, and ended up with varying shades of a washed-out, muted yellow that makes them look dingy and old. After one washing. What a disappointment."
3,OK quality but original price is way too high -- Don't just look for on sale %,"It has bigger size and fluffy touch, but not neatly sewed/sealed. I found same soft but better quality towel for around $7 at Macy's sale or TJMaxx.The Amazon price is floating between (...). Not bad."
2,2 towels and 2 washcloth,"It's in-expensive, but you got what you paid for!The towels are big and soft but not thirsty at all.I don't feel 100% cotton: my 10-year-old pure cotton towel is thinner (it's aging!) but very thirsty! It dried my daughter's hair instantly. This towel, although with thicker fabric, can't do the job as the 10-year-old pure cotton towel!!"
4,Excellent Bargain,"I bought these towels and was totally suprised at how good they were especially after reading some of the older comments. They are very fluffy and big....an excellent bargain at the time and prices when I bought them! They are ""top of the line"" and washed up gorgeously!"
2,Discoloration,"I originally gave these towels a 5-star rating but I am having to downgrade the rating to a two-star rating. The quality of the towels is great. I love the size and how fluffy and absorbant they are. HOWEVER, there is something in my bathroom that I use (I haven't figured out what it is yet) that when I dry off with the towels, the blue turns to a purple color. At the present nearly a third of my towels are ruined due to the discoloration so I'm going to be giving the towels to Good Will and purchasing new ones. I never had any problems with Martex towels and color retention so this has been quite disturbing. I'd probably buy these towels again in white or a neutral color as they are wonderful towels but I'd be careful about the darker colors."
2,just ok for hamish,not one of mc beatons better books in the series;not really won enjoyable character; lots of undesirable characters;
3,Lovely bag but had to return,"This is a very lovely bag, and looks well-made and high-quality -- but I thought that the leather was too stiff and the strap-drop was also a bit too short, making it a struggle to get things in and out of the purse while having it on/over the shoulder."
2,Leather handbag that has a defective handle.,"I bought this bag a few years ago but just got around to writing this review. Do not buy this bag. After only a few months (in which I did not even carry this bag everyday), the leather handle began to loosen and now I can't even carry it. I spent almost $200 on this bag and dont even think it is worth getting repaired. The repair will probably cost about half of what I paid for it. I will not buy any leather handbags from this company ever again."
2,"Purse does not look like it did in the picture, especially the color","I asked the week that I received it to have Ebags to send me the into to return it, but they never did. The purse does not look like the picture and the tan color was more of a brown. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase"
2,Okay product,"I thought this product would be good, but the whirlpool and shower spray is not what I expected. The buttons don't work well, so you have to push hard on it. Also, the whirlpool and the shower spray do not work at the same time. I guess I expected too much from this product. The tub and baby sling is great, but not worth $40. I think the company should sell the tub and baby sling seperately."
2,Not worth all the hype.....,"I registered for this tub wanting it very bad for my newborn. I thought what a great idea for fussy babies to have a spa and not to mention the shower rinse. Well, the first time I used this it took more time to set it up than I did using it. Also, the button on the shower head IS hard to press, and the sprayer needs to remain upside down or it will leak water allover your bathroom(found that out the hard way). When you use the spa bubbles it makes the water cold very quick. My daughter does love the spa effect, but I think she prefers warm water throughout her bath. The one thing that has really annoyed me is the baby sling has a moldy smell to it. I have washed and dried it many times and cannot get this smell out. Needless to say I had to purchase another insert for the tub, which doesn't fit very well, so Im a bit irritated. Overall this is a good idea, it needs some kinks worked out of it....Just not worth $40. So now Im off to target to purchase a new tub :-("
2,Not good for newborns,I put this on my registry because it seemed so comfy and claimes it is made for ages newborn on up. WRONG! I put my son in it and I nearly had to hold him down to the sling for dear life while I washed him. This might be good for older babies but deff not newborns.
1,Not Worth the Money,"I am beginning to think that all Summer Products are poorly made (beware of their Heart to Heart Prenatal Listening system too). The shower function worked twice and now it does not work. The whirlpool still cuts on but doesn't provide much water movement.There is definitely a design issue with the shower/spa unit. First, you have to turn the spa off to use the shower and the button is hard to push. Second, the unit is located directly at the baby's feet. When you turn it on your baby will probably jump because of the blast of water on his/her feet. Hopefully your child will not cry and be afraid of baths after that unpleasant experience."
2,Not sure it is worth the money,We don't have our baby yet -but have tried the tub to see if it works. The first one we bought did not work at all so we exchanged it. this second one the spa works but the shower doesn't. The company is sending me a new motor saying that is must be the motor. Will try it again with the new motor of if the third one doesn't work we will return it and get a different tub - and probably something else for that money.
3,Where's the Spa? Be Sure To Save the Box.,"I put this on my baby registry and was happy to receive it. As a first time mom, I had nothing to compare it to other than sponge bathing. The tub and sling were a perfect fit for my newborn and still work well for his size. The shower feature is great to have and I use it to rinse my son with clean water and to wash his hair. Unfortunately, the spa never worked so I have no idea if it would be soothing to my baby or not. Because we live in a small space in the city, we quickly tossed boxes for our baby products and could therefore not return it. So my advice is to save the box until you get the batteries and fully test this product."
2,Bulky & Stinky,"I think the concept is great and all, but the pad that it comes with is hard to clean (maybe I'm doing it wrong) - it's not that easy to pull off of the frame and then since there are foam beads inside, I wouldn't think that it's safe to put through the washer? Let me know if anyone's found an easier way. Also, the tub pretty big, although my big boy is actually filling it. I guess I was hoping for something that will sit on my counter. The one I had for my eldest was more simple in design but also convenient since it was smaller. The shower is a little hard to push - I mean it's not super-tough to push but when your hands are slippery and you're trying to be really careful, it takes a little bit of force to push that button. I think that once this is developed a bit better, it will eventually be a really good product. I like the idea of having more control than just pouring water over the kids' heads."
3,The tub is okay,I got this tub because i only have a standup shower in my apartment and I thought it would be good to have the shower feature on the tub to make it easier to bathe my son. I have been using it on my son for less than 2 months and I was enjoying it until the shower stopped working. I called the company and they are going to replace it. I do not use the whirlpool feature because it only shoots out bubbles a little distance and the go nowhere near the baby and it is so forceful that he gets scared.
2,uncomfortable to use,"I have purchased for my 4-month-old daughter and it is hard to press down the spray (uncomfortable to use it, so I do not use it and the spray hose just bothers me). I rather use the small bowel to pour water on my baby's skin). Also, the edge of bath sling is metal, so it hurts my baby's thigh and makes a red mark on it. (It would be really nice if that part is made of a soft material). I think the motor sound makes too much noise and makes my baby little scare for her age."
4,A cross between Cream and Humble Pie...,"Double CD covering all eight of their albums with an informative booklet from John McDermott. A cross between Cream and Humble Pie this band was a major stepping stone to the commercial success to some of your favorite '70's bands like Foghat, Foreigner and of course Bad Company. They had more talent than any of those bands (with the late Paul Kossoff, Paul Rodgers, Simon Kirke, John Martyn, Rabbit Bundrick, Andy Fraser, and Tetsu Yamauchi) but I think the thing that kept them from being more successful was their lack of energy, ""All Right Now"" (with perhaps the greatest rock riff ever) and one or two other songs being the exception."
4,No Frills - Lean & Muscular Blues,"Everyone knows Free for ""All Right Now"" and a very fine song it is, but this comprehensive anthology has much more to enjoy: ""Wishing Well"" and ""My Brother Jake"" are present and correct but the lesser known tracks are all finely-honed examples of what this British ""Blues-Boom"" band did best: simple, unfussy arrangements, great bass, solid drumming, well-contolled guitar heroics and soulful vocals. At the time, Free seemed like just another blues band, but hindsight shows their no-frills approach to have stood the test of time better than many of their more overblown contemporaries. Paul Rogers has one of the great voices, and he sounds far more ""at one"" with the material here than with Bad Company. The box set includes excellent photos and interesting observations from band members - a very worthwhile overview of a great band: great because they stuck to what they did well, but still kept it interesting."
4,WoW,Jenny is very hot & has no shyness What-So-Ever. a fantastic review of beautiful female anatomy !
1,Stretch... ah yes... they way they stretched to pad this out...,"To say this is an art movie is a stretch, to say this is an amateur video is a stretch, to say this was entertaining is a stretch... the girl is cute, but between the crappy noise, sorry, music and poor camera work, and the girl receiving instructions between bad jump cuts, well it's really hard to stretch this review up to the lofty score of 1 star."
1,No Comprar !,"Es una estafa, no es original. Por favor no comprar ! Es un reloj copia de uno original, se ve falso."
5,She loved it!!!!,Months ago my wife was going on and on about this watch she had seen at a department store. It's rare for her to make such a fuss over a watch so I knew it would be a great Christmas gift. So I got this one from Amazon.When she opened it up she was soooo excited. I was surprised at how beautiful it was and how large it was for a woman's watch. She took it to a local jewelry store the next day and had it sized for $3. She wears it all the time. She loves it.Great watch!!!
5,EXCELENTE,"Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela..."
1,"Ladies, this is a man's watch","This is a man's watch and so is it's partner, do not buy from this vendor, I have been unable to return this watch for a refund."
5,Beautiful Watch,"This watch came in a nicely packaged box and in great shape. Price was great, and shipping was quite fast. Easy transaction!!!"
3,Oh no...,"What have they done to the original YBBlue... this one sounds sooo washed up. I can't listen to it. The original YBBlue was dark bubblegum and for a Suicide-Album too poppy (Suicide goes disco), but some of the tracks where cool and worked well. 3 stars for the live-cd."
4,"despite shortcomings, an excellent book","Like the other reviewers, I too find there are 3 main troubles...1) outdated material. It was written over 10 years ago and some questions are no longer accurate or even relevant2) Questions are immediately followed by answers, making it difficult to test yourself.3) organization is nill. there are some llosely defined ""catagories"" but many items appear in several catagories, such as questions about the Pine Barrens. There should've been some sort of reference in the back.That said I still give this a 4 rating as there is a lot of material here, it covers lots of ground with a lot of information on almost every coneiveable topic in NJ. Despite the shortcomings, (most of which are merely annoying, not detrimental) it is quite interesting and worth the price, which is minimal."
3,Alright,"I have to give a thumbs up to the acting. Wonderful actors! The quality is very high and the scenes are well thought out. They did a great job portraying what really did happen.The only problems I had with this film, was that the scenes were very fast paced and they don't allow you to get to know the characters very well. There are some loose-end scenes that leave you hanging and wondering what became of those people. I thought they could've added more drama and imagination-- maybe deviating from the actual story a little bit by adding a side story romance. The ending is not very uplifting and could've used a better one. Overall, I think this is a one-time film."
4,"Writing, acting & directing all good","I learned from this film things I didn't know about the Lincoln assassination, but probably should have. There were times (only a few) when the film dragged a bit, but the production quality made up for that. I recommend The Conspirator to anyone who's interested in history, the law, and the constitution -- if that viewer is also able to be entertained by an intelligent script with very little action. One complaint: several fine actors had roles that I wished gave them more screen time."
2,Disappointed,"Wow. Sorely disappointed and yet such high expectations from James McAvoy & Robert Redford. The pace, especially in the beginning, is s l o w, and some of the dialog was wince-inducing. Wish I had my 2 bucks and 2 hours back."
3,Ho Hum,I knew the story and it was apparent very early that the trial was going to be a sham. A revenge trial at best. I have seen Robin Wright play much better parts. This movie just sort of ho hummed along until the no surprize end finally arrived. Wait for Netflix or cable. Don't buy it.
1,Wow I hated this movie,Get prepared to be bored out of your skull while you watch Robert Redford's incredible attempt to stretch the Lincoln assassination into a Bush/War on Terrorism basing film.
2,Deceived,Said it was a the 2 disc collectors version but only had one disc and the sender gave us a free movie of something we did not ask for. Very disappointed.
2,not interesting,"Not interesting, little content. I thought this would have been much deeper in it's scope. Production value was good but short on story."
4,Great,This was something for my husband who is a teacher. He orders a lot on here for his students and it came quick.
3,Learned something about the trial,Interesting movie.I do not know just how much was factual.If the trial went as it did in the movie with political discrimination (I believe it did) then it was a travesty of justice.
5,Very Well done,This movie was very well done. I was skeptical at first but it was a very clean yet clenching depiction of the assassination plot.
4,Interesting Film,"I found this film to be very interesting. I do recommend it to anyone with an interest in the law, history and the way or our current judicial system."
4,A well made courtroom drama,"A well made courtroom drama examining issues of fairness, rights, and constitutionality in the pursuit of political ends. This exploration of the trampling of rights and laying aside of the constitution is a fitting bookend in telling the end story of the President who started us down the slippery slope of wholesale Executive disregard for the Constitution which has accelerated ever since. (Not that that is addressed in the movie, but it gives the movie extra punch for those who know their history.)"
4,Fascinating,"I purchased and streamed this Robert Redford film . I REALLY like the films Mr. Redford has directed . Particularly QUIZ SHOW and A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT . This was an easy sell for me owing to the historical elements , it being a period picture and the fine cast . I've not read much history since my early twenties . Obviously , a lot of folks here know their history better than i , and/or dislike the film because Mr. Redford can get pretty preachy in some of his less highly regarded films . I can't speak to how accurate this film is or is not . I do think the average man or woman on the street might rather enjoy it though . See for yourself ."
2,ok everybody....places!,"wow redford.... know what you get when you serve up paper mache painted to look like a christmas goose?....hollowed-out, tasteless paper mache for dinner. that is what this movie felt like. 2 dimensional, you could almost hear, ""ready, action!..cut"". none of the scenes nor sentiment had any depth or realism to them at all. couldnt even finish it for lack of fresh air. the movie died of a shot to the head, emptying it of its brains and blood supply, thusly its ability to thrive"
5,Excellent,Excellent! Arrived in Excellent condition. As for the movie; it does not take into the all of the facts of the movie. A book was written by one of the witnesses that proves she was guilty and should have been hung.
3,"Good, but could have been more interesting","The Conspirator should be re-titled as ""the Trail of Mary Surrat""Although it was an intriguing film about a dark period in United States History, the movie never really focused on the planning and personalities involved in the assassination."
3,The Conspirator,"This is a very good movie if you are really into history and Abraham Lincoln, John Wilkes Booth and that time period."
2,"Big on Hype, but very little content!","First, we all know how this movie ends. It was initially played up because of its historical accuracy, but then you never heard another word. After watching the movie I understood why. They had wonderful costumes and period sets, but the film was extremely bland! Save your money! Sooner or later it will be on the History Channel and you will understand my comments."
4,The Conspirator.,"An interesting, easy watch, good entertainment. Sad commentary about we the people. I pray each of us can lose more of ourselves and try hard to be more like Lincoln."
5,Incredible!!,"This movie should be required after seeing ""Lincoln"" or reading ""Band of Rivals"" or anybody who loves President Lincoln. Excellent!!"
4,Sleeper,"The conspirator is a good movie. I have to admit its a little long winded, but that's to be expected of a historical drama. Give it a chance, it will make you think about some of the laws that we live by."
3,The Conspirator,"The movie was so-so, with the extra materials actually more interesting to watch. It is sufficiently historically accurate, but obviously having Robin Wright playing such a controversial character is an attempt to pull sympathies. So enjoy the movie, but don't base your history lesson on it!"
4,A Respectful Portrayal,"What I know of the search for the killers of President Abraham Lincoln comes primarily from the mesmerizing book,Manhunt. Mary Surratt was one of about five who were charged with conspiracy and stood trial. Never fully answering whether or not she was guilty, the film is definitely sympathetic to her. In fact, it presents her character and her religious faith in a very respectful manner. I found this film to be every bit as engaging as wasManhunt."
3,unsettling bit of history,"Wanted to watch this after seeing Lincoln. Knew some of the background, but really helps flesh out the story of co-conspirator Mary Surratt. Echos the fear and reactivity post 9/11, esp. the suspension of legal rights and the reliance on Military Tribunals instead of civilian courts. Got me researching more about the Surratt clan and Frederick Aiken's (Mary's overmatched lawyer's) life post-trial. I'll watch anything Redford is involved in, and this was good, not great as a piece of acting and a piece of storytelling. Mixed review on historical accuracy (like Lincoln), but it's a good conversation starter, raising important legal, moral and political issues, and the risks of repeating the mistakes of history."
4,Solid Movie,"I'm a history buff, so I thought it was fascinating. I could see how it might be too boring for people who are not particularly interested in history."
4,Great Movie,"I enjoyed this flick, and made you think just how corrupt our government was and is today. I worth watching film."
1,A RE-WRITTEN HISTORY?,"In a court of law, Redford wouldn't be convicted of exactly rewriting history, but he is guilty of a more refined crime... re-proportioning events to change the perception of history - thus rewriting history, in effect. The conspirators were, in fact, all guilty. A great place to start learning about the conspirators is James L. Swanson's illustrated history,Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial and Execution.Mary Surratt WAS, in fact, accorded due process... the due process of 1865!I'm constantly amazed that people of today fail to see the simple fact that the due process, or ANY thinking, for that matter was different 147 years ago than that of today. We've come a long way since then, and it is a huge mistake to overlay 21st century morality on people of another time. They were product of their world and experiences, just as we are product of ours.It is just that simple."
4,Great gift,This was a gift for a history buff. Great price for the 2 disc set. Arrived exactly when it said it would.
5,History,"I love American history, this one makes you think about what the accused were going through. I believe it was well written & well produced."
4,Booth / Osama,"Tremendous film. I have no doubt that Redford made this to compare the emotions of Americans then to the emotions of Americans today. President dead - throw out the law. Twin Towers - throw out the law. Booth - trapped with no escape and shot. Osama - trapped with no escape and shot. Capture these men and find out more truth. Nope, I guess the truth is not want we want. Great film."
3,Slow but not bad.,"I actually liked the movie, it was slow but well acted. Not sure about the accuracy of events, and it was oozing with liberalism. The man who defended Surratt may have been our first bonafide liberal. By the way, does redford know that Guantanamo Bay prison camp is still open for business?"
1,No Sound,I tried it several times and there was no sound available. This had never happened before. I may try it again some other day.
5,"Great movie, great acting and great plot line","Great movie, solid acting and great plot line. Very riveting performances, I'd definitely watch it and recommend it again. A unique angle to a story we probably never got the privilege of hearing that much about in school. A must see!"
5,Must see back side of the Lincoln tragedy,"Great story! Very sad. Seems government never changes. :-( not sure what was worse, assassination of a great President or the blind manipulation of its citizens by government officials....."
5,Loved the movie,I thought this was a fantastic movie. I enjoy historical movies that make me question what I thought I knew. Definitely worth a watch.
1,JUNK > Let's defend the conspirators,"JUNK > Let's defend the conspirators. This is a pathetic attempt at visually and verbally criminalizing the prosecutors of Surratt - typical liberal tripe (defend the guilty because they're misunderstood). Do they honestly expect us to believe that Mary was deaf in her own boarding house? Too busy making the beds? Cooking flap jacks? Kevin Kline as Stanton? R U KIDDING? Too tall, too thin and not enough facial hair (look at a picture of the squat Stanton) only the blind would cast him in the role. How is Redfords eyes these days?"
4,independence versus romance,"The astonishing thing about this book -- and a lot of Henry James's writing -- is his insight into the problems of women. This book deals with the problem of independence and freedom. Most of us, let's admit it, love the idea of being swept off our feet by some competent, assertive male. It's a real turn-on. If you don't believe it, check out how many successful professional women secretly read historical romances by the boxload. The problem comes the next morning when he starts to take control, bit by bit, of your entire life. In this book you have Olive, who is not, I think, a lesbian but someone who is very lonely and doesn't trust men and Verena, who likes men just fine, but is, for the moment anyway, under the spell of Olive and her feminist ideology. Are these our only options? Verena Makes her choice, but James notes that the tears she sheds may not, unhappily, be her last."
4,"Excellent characterization, timely satire","This is the first James novel I've read, so my high ranking doesn't take into account the relative merits of his novels. That having been said, this novel impressed me with its excellent character development, amusing satire, and spot-on portraits of certain types of oh-so-serious New England crusaders for whom an ironic outlook is alien. The development of the southerner Basil seemed a little weak to me, but James knows his Bostonians and his sketches remain fresh."
5,Henry James is relevant today.,"This book by James is a satiric view at the reformist tendency of Bostonians. Interestingly, Henry Adams, a friend of James, took the same approach in the former's prize winning autobiography. James' portrayal of Ms. Birdseye raised some eyebrows because of the character's similarity to a noted Boston scion of the age. William James had to write to his brother to tell him to tone his description down (the book was being serialized.Historically the book provides a fascinating glipse of Beacon Hill and its environs as well as the attitudes of the day.The book does satirize the feminist movement. James had an interest in defining the american 'girl'. This very witty novel fits in with that trend. James is very descriptive. This book is to be savored not rushed."
3,Interesting 20th Century take on the book,"Haven't read the book yet, but now I want to. I watched a moderately good movie last week called THE CALIFORNIANS, and before returning it to the video store, I saw on the back that the story line was taken from The Bostonians by Henry James. (The story involves a brother and sister with the last name of Ransom, he a developer, sister, Olive, an eco-activitst, with a sweet young female folksinger caught in the rivaly between the siblings. Reading the synopsis of the novel, I could definitely see the connections to the movie. I am sure the book is better!)"
2,Not her best,"I usually love Anne Tyler's books, but could not get into this one. Few of the characters are well developed. The daughters all coalesce into a single being who is very selfcentered and completely unsympathetic. The main character is more sympathetic, but not much better developed.The book is a mish-mash of characters and situations that are reminiscent of other Anne Tyler books. It feels like she is copying herself, and doing a bad job."
1,"Pointless, nasty, stupid people","Am I supposed to like these people, or find their lives even remotely interesting? Because if so, the author has failed miserably. No No and Min Foo and Wa Wa and Poo Poo were simply the most boring, obnoxious, wastes of space ever created. If this is women's literature, I would like to opt out of womenhood."
3,"Good, but could've been half-again longer","I've read all of Anne Tyler's novels save one at this point, and I liked them all to varying degrees (or I wouldn't have kept reading :^). This one is good, with some likeable and lovable characters, some good 'moments', a real sense of family that she so often conjurs up, yet... I didn't like the direction the book took in the end, although I have to give her credit for not taking the easy way out. In any case, I think it could've easily been 400 pages instead of 275, with a bigger slice of Rebecca's life than we were given."
2,A pathetic family,"Anne Tyler is the queen when it comes to creating and developing quirky characters. Unfortunately, this family is so pathetic and so miserable, the reader may find it impossible to sympathize or relate to them.I wanted to reach through the pages and strangle everyone, especially her good for nothing stepdaughters."
3,I hate to give Anne Tyler less than five stars!,"I am the quintessential Tyler fan! I've read every one of her books. My favorite is still ""Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant."" This one disappointed me. It was predictable. I feel she could have done so much more with the theme. A number of writers are covering the theme of meeting up with, or the desire to meet an old beau from our youth. But she was not at her best with the characters. And there were so many! C'mon Anne, you are still my favorite. Try again!"
3,"If you really, really like Anne Tyler-","You may well love this book.I am only a casual fan of Ms. Tyler's. I ""joined"" at _Accidental Tourist,_ and have read every book of hers since.This my be the last one I read. It is well written, and rich with detail. Tyler would be a great historical interpreter of Baltimore.However, I wanted to smack most of the characters for being spiritless mopes.I had enomous empathy for Rebecca ""Beck"" Davitch, but she was the only chracter I liked.I find it interesting that most of Tyler's women are not college graduates. Rebecca continues in this pattern.Rebecca is as endearing/infuriating as Breathing Lessons's Maggie, but _Breathing Lessons_ is a more satisfying book.Laurie Colwin's _Family Happiness_ explores many of the same themes, but in a much more engaging manner."
5,On being an imposter in your own life,"We shall not cease from our exploration, and at the end of all our exploring, we shall arrive where we started and know the place for the first time--T.S. Eliott. Rebecca Davitch is in search of something vital she has left behind in this charming, quirky book. As always, the final discovery is much less entertaining than the search. Anne Tyler is a lovely writer full of life and sensitivity. The book ripples and sparkles not only with eccentric Tyler characters but also with phrases to be savored. ""Back When We Were Grownups"" is a rare new book full of soul and humanity. It also has the best opening line in memory. An excellent choice."
2,Ghastly family,"If I hadn't had to read this book for a bookclub I would have stopped at page 6. It is one of the worst books I've ever read and I read constantly.And over many years. The ridiculous names, the endless family get togethers of people who disliked each other and appeared to have no other friends/life, the tedious details. The best line for me was when Rebecca says ""I'm superficial"" but meant to say superfluous! She was pathetic. All the characters were one dimensional and why did she persevere with the hopeless Will who had no will at all. All that hypocritical chirpiness. I wanted to shake her. And the ungrateful, whinging, whining adults and their offspring. Uggg!"
2,Uninspired reading.,"The book started off well enough. A confused 53 year old questioning her choices in life. I wanted to read on and did. But, the characters were so annoying and their personalities so irritating that I found I couldn't empathize with any of them.Perhaps the most underwhelming was the ""Non-character"", Will Allenby. Such an unsympathetic ""wuss"" and hardly a love interest in the making. The whole relationship was left so unresolved and left me wondering why.The book ended abruptly in my eyes and I was left disppointed. It seemed to me that there was no closure to any of the plot lines, with the exception of Poppy making it to his 100th birthday. Overall, a real yawn for me."
3,Another bittersweet slice of reality...,"I should be used to Anne Tyler by now. She doesn't dish up easy plots or pat endings, and that, at least, isn't a problem. Bittersweet is her specialty, and it's what I've come to expect.However, although her stories are often unusually distanced and cool, I think this book has slid a little too close to the ""frigid"" end of the spectrum. The main character, Rebecca, bloodlessly navigates her past and present, and readers are left watching as if through a valium-induced haze as the events of her life unfold with little comment or emotion.Tyler's writing is masterful as always. And I can't fault her for her plot, which is full of fascinating developments and achingly realistic family interactions. Tyler paints a keen portrait of Rebecca and her entire (very!) extended family -- so vivid, in fact, that I felt frustrated, and ultimately, disappointed, that Tyler didn't let me FEEL her story as vividly as I could see and hear it."
2,"Very promising beginning, but then...","I really enjoyed the first 90 pages or so of this novel. Then I thought the situations became contrived, and I felt that Tyler began to make the characters quirky as an alternative to actually developing them. The dialogue between Rebecca and her mother, especially, was excruciating. I also found the plotline involving Rebecca and Will to be simply implausible. Tyler seemd to be altering her characters just to get the story where she wanted it to go. The end result was tedious and relentlessly manipulative. I didn't buy any of it, and there ended up being little or no insight or resolution to Rebecca's dilemma."
3,A fairy tale...,"... about a 50-something woman who is essentially allowed to go back home again and ponder where her life may have gone had she chosen a different path. Unfortunately, the characters are weak and unlikable; the plot is virtually non-existent; and the subject matter is less than intriguing in its application. I got the impression that Tyler didn't care for her characters either."
1,Back When We Were Grownups,"How many addle-brained characters can you fit in one novel? How many silly nick-names can a reader be expected to endure? Does anyone know whatever happened to the real Anne Tyler? She used to be one of my favorite authors (Breathing Lessons, Lonesome Restaurant) but I guess I grew up.The book is supposed to be about a middle-aged woman (widow) who suddenly contacts her former boyfriend whom she ditched years ago. It has all sorts of possibilities but instead of exploring any of them dwells endlessly on details of her large self-centered, rude, ungrateful extended family which is made up of stepchildren and their spouses and children (I gave up trying to keep track of them), a grandfather, mother, aunt, neighbors... and she is a door mat for all of them, enduring their snide remarks and frequent demands. So what do we learn from all of this? I'm not sure and I'm not sure why I bothered to finish the book."
2,"Not what you expect, good prermis but boring story & uninteresting characters.",After spending the first 2 chapters going over an entire family reunion of the most bizarre names and to make it even worse they are nicknames so you have to learn both for each person. The story sounded like it could be an interesting one but I don't feel that there was ever really a split in the road. Not a great divide that would have ultimately changed her life significantly. All 5 of us in our bookclub were bored by this one and had to struggle to get through it.
5,What is Your True Life?,"For anyone who has felt like life has passed them by, this story will have special meaning as a woman ponders what her true life should have been."
3,Once when we had more time to read slow books..,"I was lucky enough to be in the wilderness of Yaak, Montana, when I was reading this book. I moved to Rick Bass' s excellent ""Book of Yaak"", which is (a bit slow but) well written until I had left the area, and completed ""Once when we were...."" on the plane ride home. It was plodding and I kept waiting for her to take her life into her hands; fine for the plane, but not something to race back to. Not bad, not compelling."
3,Rather disappointing.............,I had very high expectations when I began reading this book. I kept waiting for it to get exciting or even for something to happen - 100 pages into it I was still waiting. I can't believe that it took her almost twenty years to contact her old boyfriend. And she was so stoic - never complaining or telling any of those step-daughters off! I couldn't take it - she was so passive and they just walked all over her!What a disappointment when she did get back together with Will only to realize why she had dumped him in the first place and to settle for the life she had been living all those years. What was it about - her finding herself and learning to be happy with what she had???It is a not a book I would highly recommend.
2,"Disappointing, but an honest view of adulthood.","This was my first Anne Tyler novel and it was disappointing. The theme held such promise (we are not who we intended to be) but was never developed. It just hung there in the background, occassionally coming to light and just as quickly pushed back again. As I read the book I kept hoping the main character would spend more time exploring what her life should have been. The only clue here is that she thought she would marry another but again, she never reveals what she thought her life should have been; only that ""this"" wasn't it.The best parts of the novel quite accurately depict a matron's role in family life--selfless and unappreciated. Every eldest daughter of a family should be able to identify with this character.Lastly, we are able to glimpse the truth that others see us in a different way than we see ourselves...whether we like it or not."
3,Underwhelming,"The book was well written but the story was a little underwhelming. The characters were interesting, but not very deep (except for the main character, who was very well portrayed). I must reveal that I am male, and the story may have been better appreciated and targeted to the female audience."
1,Not recommended,"If the manuscript of ""Back When We Were Grownups"" was sent under an unknown author's pen name, it would not have been published. This was my first Tyler book and will be my last. The book was trite, tiresome, boring and unrealistic. The book appears to be written about the 50's rather than present day. The characters are shallow and not fully developed. I would not waste my time reading another Tyler novel."
2,Never really grew to love the Davtich's...,"As much as I tried, I never could make myself feel anything more for Rebecca Davitch than a passing nod of ""Oh well..."" There wasn't much ""substance"" to this novel and the point was lost somewhere along the way. I finished it, but only when there was absolutely nothing else to read."
2,Someone has to be in the minority,"I found this book boring, convoluted, and very easy to put down. The book did not keep my interest, and I only finished it, because I finish all books. I am in the correct age group, but seem to not like the type of self-absorbed characters in this book. The make-up of the family is changing and this book does not fit in with my life, or the lives of the people and families in my life."
3,So-So,"I wasn't thrilled with this book. The story was okay, sort of slow but the ending just sort of left you hanging."
3,This was a best seller?,"I am stunned that this was a best seller. Perhaps the author's name sold the book? I have not read any other novels by her, but I don't think I would be in a rush to after reading this novel.I felt as though I was waiting around for something big to happen, when in fact I reached the end of the book and realized there was nothing! First off, what is with all the weird names? (Min Foo, for example, nicknamed due to her ""slant, oriental"" eyes! Cripes!) And then the main character, Rebecca is on the edge of something decent and exciting, but never really makes it. Instead we are dragged through her wishy-washy life and inability to capture her audience.There are good points here, though. SOme characters are quite likeable, like Poppy and Peter. Their personality and characteristics are life like and touching.I wouldn't say stay away, but don't go running to buy this one."
3,Did nothing for me,"A good book to me is one that I finish and continually think about the characters the next few days. This book didn't have the first character that I cared about. The main character was annoying. I don't understand why she dumped the new boyfriend (her ex-boyfriend) so callously. The stepkids were spoiled rotten. Even her daughter made so many mistakes in life with 3 husbands of various races, that you wondered what kind of mother was Rebecca? Obviously, not a very good one. She reminded me of a Stepford Wife - always giving the appearance that she was happy and life was grand, when her life was anything but."
2,Flat Characters and Poor Conflict Resolution,"I'm a Tyler fan who was truly disappointed with this book. It was one of those ""Please, just let me get through it"" reads. The supporting/secondary characters -- the main character's family -- weren't fleshed out. Tyler sets up different life situations for the four daughters -- but they all read like the same person. The heroine never truly goes through any kind of change as a character -- which made me wonder: ""What, exactly was the point?"" A slow read, weak characters and a thin plot."
3,An Awful Lot of Promotion,"Anne Tyler had quite a bit of promotion for this book. Considering the hype and readers group info I expected a gem. Not really what happened!!Rebecca [main character] lost her husband and proceeded to second guess every major decision she had made in the past. I expected dramatic changes, breathtaking life changing moves, and incidents of monumental emotional distress.What really happened was a book with a somewhat shallow plot and partially developed characters. The idea was great. When I read the reviews I was sure that Anne Tyler would take her main character and have her experience events that we as common readers would say, ""Wow, if only I had thought of that"" but what she did was had her very plain Rebecca make minor adjustments creating very little change.Disappointing but entertaining."
3,A BIT CONFUSING...with NO RESOLUTION...,"I found the opening of the story, with the many characters (too many)a bit confusing to the centeral part of the story. Tyler, appeared to really focused on Rebecca and the events in her life; the adult/ children add any signifance to the storyline.Poppy was waiting to celebrate his 100 birthday...? the assortment of children and their dysfrunctional lives...are not why ""she is questioning herself imagine."" I felt that Rebecca is much more than what was written, with a much stronger force driving her...she personality was only slightly developed...if her only attraction to W. Allenby, as her only love, what is her definition/expectation of ""LOVE?""She was seaching... when she met the Davitch family.Arlice Prince"
4,"Older Women need stories,too","This story is insightful, looking into the mind of a woman who's not just a beautiful, capable savvy person who's also YOUNG (most heroines seem to be under 30), but who's lived and won life's battles and has scars. Women (and men too, I suspect) feel inside just the same at 50 or 60 as they did at 20."
3,Ho Hum.,"The book was okay. It was one of those that just goes along and then is over. It did remind me of a time when I use to look back and think, what if I had married the guy I dated in high school. Sometimes we remember things better than they actually were. Apparently it happens to a lot of us, just like it did to the main character in this book. Back When We Were Grown Ups wasn't overly exciting, sometimes it was actually tiring. I was a bit disappointed."
2,Why in the world does she stay?,"I finished the book, only because of its initial promise. Also, as a 'woman of a certain age' I was interested in the idea of reclaiming one's lost sense of self. But alas, the characters who surround Beck are miserable, silly, pathetic, self-absorbed parasites. Beck should flee the Open Arms, and never look back. I kept waiting for some sort of flash of insight, but Beck just plods along, putting up with rude and borish family and friends. The dialogue is so stilted, it aches. Also, the book just flat ran out of steam. I read the final pages twice, thinking I must have missed something. If you are a major fan of Ms. Tyler's -- wait for the paperback."
2,Disappointing - Does Not Hold Up to Her Earlier Books!,"I have been a devoted Anne Tyler fan since ""Breathing Lessons"" and own every one of her books, however, I was most disappointed in this story. In this book, as well as her last couple of novels, she seems to have tried to become more ""mainstream,"" her characters have lost much their delightful quirkiness, there is very little sense of humor coming through. Also, the ending was just flat. It just suddenly ends with little, if anything, learned, nothing resolved, nothing changed, leaving one to wonder why the story was told in the first place. This may sound harsh, but I can still pick up any of her earlier stories and reread it, laugh, and be absolutely amazed all over again. Unfortunatlately, ""Back When We Were Grownups"" does not have this strength."
3,Where was the story?,"This novel began well enough. An interesting, imperfect main character with grown, adult children, and grandchildren. The story sounded like it could be captivating, except it never quite came to be. It rolled along pleasantly, but it didn't involve me enough to care. My suggestion is to pick something else!"
2,a rather annoying book,"I'm not sure where to start in describing how annoying this book was. The plot was tedious. There was no momentum to carry you through the book (I only read the whole thing out of desperation -- hoping the plot had to improve). There were far too many quirky characters in this book, it was if the author was really trying to make the book interesting. It didn't work by a long shot. Plus it was really overkill that all the daughters had off beat nicknames. I found most of the behavior of the characters to be so annoying. I really hated the way Rebecca strung Will along until she could finally make up her mind that she really didn't want/need him. I suppose I didn't care for this book because it isn't my typical genre. But I wanted to try something different and the other reviews made it sound pretty good. So if you normally read this type of book, you may actually like this one. If you, you may find this one hard to bear."
3,"Well, everyone seems to love Anne Tyler's Novels, but","To me they are all the same -- the same Green Jello Salad with bits of pineapple in it that appear at oh-so-many family picnics.This book ends the same way that all the Anne Tyler novels that I've read end --- with happy smiling people running toward The Ones They Love, arms held high in the air waving like seaweed in the Sargasso Sea, and in between the pages of each book, there are the same dull conversational bits, boring boring boring.To keep (me and) Anne Tyler's followers happy, I will cease reading (and thus cease reviewing) and more of her novels.Amen."
4,Back When We Were Grownups,"I really enjoyed ""Back When We Were Grownups"". Anne Tyler has such a way of making ordinary lives fascinating. None of her novels have a lot of twists and turns, and either you like it or you don't. Some people can appreciate the ordinary, and there are others that this would not be their best choice. Anyhow, this novel demonstrates that. It takes the ordinary, and makes it beautiful. I thought it was really good,you becomes attached to the characters and their lives, and hope for them to be happy. I would definitely recommend this book,it is another great novel from Anne Tyler."
3,"Good, but confusing","I liked this book a lot. I liked how Rebecca came to a realization in her life that maybe she wasn't who she thought she was. Maybe her entire reality at this point in her life was based on a fiction? This book explores both her reality and her fiction. In this book, the author allows all the questions people have about their existence come to the front to be dealt with--maybe not answered, but at least dealt with.Major drawbacks in the book for me were the people's names. They were just a little too much. About the only people I could keep track of were the kids. I thought about keeping them straight on paper, but the book is too short for that.This is a good book, and I look forward to reading more books by Ms. Tyler."
3,A Simple Read that holds Meaning,"The story is quite comical and the comedy holds the book together. This is about a woman who is somewhere in her fifties and has basically woke up. Most of her life she has been living but not really consciously. She seems to kind of lost her way somewhere along her path. This story illustrates how easy this can happen, even if our lives have been great, something nags at us to keep searching and learning more about ourselves. The ending is really great because it kinda leaves things open. Were not to sure where Rebecca, the main character is going to go or stay. She has this really big family who definately have their hangups but are illustrated with such humor. I really liked the imagery of there personalities. The story does not really get alot of action or plot going, it is easy but the tale holds an emotional chord that resonates within all of us.Lisa Nary"
4,Surprisingly uplifting character study from Anne Tyler,"Anne Tyler describes women in all their frustrating and wise complexity, and she succeeds again in Back When We Were Grownups. You'll feel sorry for this woman, then you'll be angry at her for being a doormat, then you'll want to protect her from the chances she takes. Her kids and their multiple marriages are difficult to keep straight at times, but just keep your eyes on the mother and you'll find that in the end, you understand her completely."
2,Nothing new here,"When I told my father I had just finished reading an Anne Tyler novel, he described exactly the plot without even knowing which title I had read: It was set in Baltimore, about a large, dysfunctional family with some eccentric quirks, and not very much happens. I realized that this was not only an apt summary of BWWWG but also every Tyler novel I have ever read. There are those writers who write one book and know they are done, and then there are those who write the same book over and over but never realize it."
5,"""a review of what it was like to be alive""","Back When We Were Grownups is a wonderful book, as good as Tyler's Breathing Lessons, which won a Pulitzer Prize! As always, her characters are real people. They are foolish, insecure, thin-skinned, fearful of what life throws their way...and sometimes wonderfully wise and always truly human. Poppy's speech on his 100th birthday, a speech generally ignored by most of the attendees at his party, is the answer to the question, What is the secret of life?! Tyler has the three qualities I prize most in my favorite authors: the ability to see what makes people tick, an eye for the perfect revealing detail, and a grand sense of humor. As always, I eagerly await Tyler's next book!"
2,What's happened to Anne Tyler?,"Doesn't anyone remember the Anne Tyler of years past? She wrote books in which things actually happened, things that were funny, meaningful, and poignant all at the same time.That quality is sadly lacking in ""Before We Were Grownups.""Worse yet, the characters are so poorly defined. Perhaps three of them have a distinct identity, but no more. For instance, I never was able to distinguish the lead character's four daughters from each other (apart from a few superficial gimmicky traits: this is the one that gets married a lot, that's the cranky one, etc.).And just try to compare the stock-issue shy little misfit boy in this book to the richly-drawn timid child in ""The Accidental Tourist"" and you'll see what I mean.Such a disappointment."
5,There's no one like Anne Tyler,"Back When We Were Grownups is a delight. I found myself laughing out loud many times; in fact, while reading (and laughing) in a restaurant, a stranger asked me what book was so amusing. I don't know how Anne Tyler can take such simple every day situations and put her unique spin on them. I just hope she keeps on doing it. Thank you, Anne Tyler, for a wonderful novel."
3,A Light Read,"This the first book I've read by Anne Tyler and I must admit I was expecting more due to her reputation. This is a well written story about a 53 year old woman who hits a point where she realizes her life has not turned out anything like she thought it would. Then as she tries to go after the life she thought she would have, she realizes she likes her life as it is. As vague as I sound writing that, the whole plot isn't that much more detailed. True this is not a plot driven story but when the end came I couldn't help but feel a little let down. I craved something a little more dramatic.That said I enjoyed the read. It was light and full of interesting characters especially Rebecca. Even though I am in my 20s I could relate to a lot of what she was feeling and going through, I only wish that the ending was stronger."
3,Not one of Anne's best,"I have read and own every one of Anne Tyler's books and usually I love them. I didn't hate this book, but it certainly was not one of her best. I read several of the other reviews on it and I have to echo the complaint of the ridiculous choice of names for the characters. The characters were never quite fully developed, yet it still was an enjoyable read. But for a real treat try Anne's ""Dinner At The Homesick Resturant"" or some of her other books. She really is a wonderful writer with keen insight on human nature and makes us all laugh at ourselves and not take our selves so seriously."
3,disappointing,"Like many of the other reviewers, I consider myself a big Anne Tyler fan. So I was quite excited to read her latest novel. But also like some of the reviewers, I was not at all intrigued by Rebecca's plight and found the characters to be uninteresting. I was especially numbed every time her old flame, Will (I don't even remember if that's the correct name) came into the story. The longer I read the book, the less I sympathized with Rebecca. I was completely unsatisfied by the ending, although I guess I was glad it finally ended!I did give more than one star because although I did not like the story, I still love Anne Tyler's writing.I hope this is just a one-time lapse and that Ms. Tyler will be back with more of her wonderful stories very soon!"
2,Disappointing at best,"Based on several reviews and, I must admit, a great first line (""Once upon a time, a woman woke up..."") I purchased this book. Unfortunately, I found this book to be very disappointing. The story line itself seemed like it would be interesting, but I never developed a real sense of compassion or interest in Rebecca Davitich (the lead character). To be honest, I didn't really care what happened to her, or her funky family. A lot of reviews mentioned how Anne Tyler characters often resemble people they know in real life. I'm sure I know some ""Anne Tyler characters"", too, but I wouldn't care to read a novel about them. To be fair, the prose is beautiful. It is a beautifully written book, but not that interesting."
3,Not A Memorable Tyler Novel,"The main problem I had, with this book, is that three days after I read it, I could not remember what exactly it had been about. I actually picked it up and couldn't remember if I finished reading it or not.(but I had) Rebecca had a pretty good life and seemed to be too much of a whiner. Poppy was my favorite character and I actually liked the old boyfriend. I have always loved Anne Tyler's characters and their quirks. She writes them so well, but I grew tired of Rebecca. I felt like she wanted to change her life for all the wrong reasons.This won't keep me from being an Anne Tyler fan. It just didn't seem to be one of her best."
4,Rebecca studies her life and wonders how she got there.,"Rebecca spends her time thinking about how she got to be a widow, a stepmother, a grandmother and the social spark that rents her home for professional parties.I enjoyed her introspection, and her attempt to return to the past with her high school sweetheart. She is at 53, wondering how she has become the woman that she is.Her family, NoNo, Min Foo, Patch, Zeb, and all the players offer variety to Rebecca's life and it is obvious that Rebecca is their steadying force. The family, in my opinion, did not appreciate Rebecca, and I wondered if she even noticed that at times.This is the first Tyler book that I have read, and I enjoyed the plot and her characters. Overall, an enjoyable read, worth 4 stars."
2,a disappointment,"I'm almost 53 (the age of the main character in this book; and I, too, sometimes wonder how I ended up in the life I have, instead of a ""better"" one). But I couldn't connect at all with Rebecca, or anyone else in the book, for that matter. Tyler's characters are caricatures, some of them with impossibly cutesy names and others with improbable personalities. The Davitch family is like no family I've ever come across (and I'm glad I haven't!). And the idea that the hippie-esque Rebecca would actually seriously consider getting together with her extremely anal and boring ex-beau is unbelievable.All in all, a disappointing read. Tyler has a way with comedy, but it's wasted in this book."
3,Still waiting for something to happen,"This was my first Anne Tyler novel. I enjoyed her writing style and will give her another try with Noah's Compass. But Rebecca, Beck, drove me crazy. Being of a similar age I really wanted to shake her awake. I wanted something, anything, to happen. Perhaps someone will die, the creaky old house will burn down or she just walks away from it all. But sadly, nothing happened. At the end she is still just going through the motions of life.It is all rather sad. None of the characters seem to be enjoying their lives, they are all anticipating something better in the future or living in the past."
3,"Oh, Rebecca, why?","While the book was entertaining, I felt that there were a couple of critical decisions made by the main character, Rebecca, that were not fully explored and given enough time to build upon so that one would understand Rebecca's decision for her choice."
4,Finding One's Self,"Interesting story of a woman in mid life and way too involved in family issues to figure out where she fits into the big picture. She takes a look back at how she got where she is, the pluses and minuses - life's payoff and disappointments. A common theme of women who get lost in the day to day care of others. What happened to me along the way? Well written, depth of characters, but too many folks to keep up with. The number of lives and relationships tends to clutter the story. Still, a good read."
1,Life is too short to waste on such books.,"I decided to read this book because of the very favourable review from The Economist. To quote The Economist: ""Back When We Were Grownups is as perceptive, as full of gentle comedy and human warmth, as any of Ms Tyler's previous novels.""But I found that it is just one of the so many books written every year. Don't waste your time if you have not read or liked Anne Tyler before. The title suggests that the story is about Rebecca Davitch who at the age of 53 is wondering what her life might have been if she had married her college sweetheart (Will Allenby). But the novel is filled with pages describing the countless parties that Rebecca hosts in her house for her living. I did not count, but Rebecaa-Will covers not more than 15 pages.So now you know what the novel is worth."
3,What stupid names!,"Yes, I agree with the other person who commented on the stupid names, like NoNo and Jeep! I have to say I re-read the first few pages 3 times,and just found it irritating, and couldn't get into it. I even told my friends that it looks like Anne Tyler has finally reached her limit and is ""dry."" I felt that she could no longer write about new characters, and so she was relying on wierd names instead of her tradtional wierd characters. I thought maybe her editor gave her a deadline, and she was forced to write a book. --- So, now I read the other person's review and I see that she ""stuck it out"" and was well rewarded for her efforts. So, maybe I'll try it again --- But I hope she or her editor read these reviews and that she NEVER gives her characters such wierd names again, trying to be clever?? because she's losing fans."
1,Bored to death ...,"Very boring writing, absolutely not interesting. It has really nothing to say, not even to its supposed target group of middle-aged women."
1,Anne Tyler Let-Down,"I have always liked Anne Tyler (my favorite Tyler book: Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant). But this book was a huge LET-DOWN. The middle-aged woman in the book is not the least bit interesting. We don't care about her or all of her family members (and believe me, there are alot of family members. All of them have weird names, and none of the characters are developed enough that we can remember which is the daughter, which the daughter-in-law, etc.). Quite simply, the characters fail in this book. Nothing much happens except an old boyfriend from decades before her marriage shows up. The middle-aged woman spends some boring evenings with him and then decides she doesn't want to be with him anymore. And I guess she comes to some kind of quiet realization that she's content with the life she leads with this eccentric family. That's it in a nutshell. NOT worth the $... I spent... on this one!"
5,Can be appreciated by all age groups!,"I'm not at all like Rebecca, the protagonist of this book: I am not 53, I am not widowed, I don't have a brood of family members to look after. But this woman's story really resonated with me. Who hasn't wondered--at ages 20, 30, 40, or 50--how our lives might life had been different?Anne Tyler is so skilled at making a particular character's concerns universal. (And, I should add, this is the first of the author's books that I have read). How many of us make deliberate choices, and how many of us are propelled by inertia? This issue was subtly but brilliantly captured by Peter, the nerdy step-grandson and his musings about physics and his inventions.I found many layers in this book that I will consider for some days to come, I'm sure. Some characters were fuller than others, but I don't think this distracts from the story, which is really about Rebecca."
3,Read it right through on a rainy day!,"Thank goodness we had rain on Saturday because I just holed up in my ""spot"" and read this book all the way through. While I agree it's not as engaging as previous (particularly the early) books, the story was believable. Unfortunately, Tyler appears to have her characterizations down to a science -- each person is known by their traits (and only by their traits) and is 2 dimensional at best. Those traits are fascinating, though I wish there were more interaction. Knowing what Tyler can do, there should have been more juicy stuff here. However, she's still better than most anyone else at telling a story."
3,Worth reading,"While this book isn't as good as some of Tyler's other novels, it is well worth reading. Rebecca, a 53-year-old party planner, is having a mid-life crisis. How she muddles through the crisis is typically Tyler: with a wealth of characters and situations, wonderful dialogue and writing. I agree with the reviewer who noted that the novel isn't as layered as Tyler's previous works. I will, however, look forward to reading her next work."
2,Trudging through family get togethers,"If submitting yourself to incessant family get-togethers with irritating and self-centered family members sounds good to you, then this is the book for you! Let me add also the pleasure of listening to the whining of an obsessive people pleaser who never gets the guts to tell these people off and get on with her life. To be fair, it is not poorly written (have read some of her other books and enjoyed them) and there are some cute moments. But most definitely not worth the labour of having to read through."
2,No AMATEUR MARRIAGE...,"I loved the last novel I read by Anne Tyler and came to this one with high hopes. Rebecca is such a dreary character. It's hard to believe that she started life as someone introspective, shy, serious and intellectually engaged. Someone like that couldn't possibly be turned into the hectoringly cheerful, incurious and silly person she became in this book. Even her inner life, when she finally allows herself one, is flat and banal. I am going to finish this novel in a few pages, but spending time with Beck has been a drag. (And Poppy doesn't help one bit.)"
3,Back When We Were Grownups,"Ms. Tyler's story of a family with all their idiosyncrasies was not as interesting to me as one of her previous novels.I haven't read it all through because it seems to drag a bit. I know eventually I will finish the book, but until then I haven't much positive to say about it."
2,Boring,"I found this book to be a very slow read. It was very difficult to identify with the ""issues"" of the lead character. I could not summon sympathy for her.... I felt frustrated with the way she handled the chaos around her. Even the brief romantic possibility was boring."
4,"Oh, but you're wrong, Emily--","there are indeed families where all the members have as weird names or nicknames as the characters in Back When We Were Grownups. I work at a dental school & can assure you, we have patients & families who have much stranger ones that Tyler came up with in this book. In fact, sometimes I double & triple check with varying documents, signatures & types of paperwork because I'm so incredulous at the names that show up, but appear they do.I enjoyed the book. could identify with the impulse to look up someone lost touch with years ago, appreciated the character of Poppy & sympathized with the big, messy family situation."
2,This book is boring.,"This is a story that starts nowhere and goes nowhere. Lots of characters, but no one that really plays any kind of an important role. I kept reading and reading thinking that any time now, things would pick up. Well, there's a short half-gasp, then things go back into the nauseating tedium of the life of Rebecca Davitch. Pretty much a waste of 9 hours.Want to read a really good book? White Oleander by Janet Fitch! Dynamite!"
3,It was an ok book,This book was an alright read somewhat boring to me tho. I finished it but had a hard time with it.
3,Don't buy it for dogs,"Despite what the ad says, this is not a good doggy pool. It is very flimsy, with thin walls and floor material. The dogs punctured the floor within 2 days. They also can't lean on the walls or roll into them while they play without damaging the pool. Spend the $[...] bucks for a molded plastic pool to keep the pups cool."
1,Not adapted for temporary bath,"this pool is larger than I thought and is not adapted when you don't want to keep the water (because of mosquitoes) all night long and you want to change it every day. Too big and you have to fill it largely otherwie it doesn't work, the sides fall down."
4,"Great, great pool for the money","My 3-year old and his friends spent a whole lot of time splashing around in this ""no-inlfation-needed"" pool. That's why we got it. The pain with most pools like this is having to inflate them and this one has a rigid, yet ""roll-up-able"" structure that obviates the need to bursts your lungs. Love it!"
1,CRAPOLA,"When I went to fill this up...We were very, very careful to spread out the pool...purchased and laid down the protective ground cover...2"" of water noticed a small 1/4"" hole. The bottom not attached to the side...Ok water pressure will seal it...Now 4"" of water a 6"" section 2' away opened up....GOING IN THE TRASH.....My 2 grandsons never had an opportunity to get in it...DON'T BUY THIS....."
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this pool for my guinea pig to have space to run around in...little did I know that the pool is only ""plastic"" and ""snapset"" when it is filled with water. Maybe that's something I should have known intuitively, but I didn't realize that was the type of pool I was buying. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get back in the box, how it fit in there to begin with I'll never know, so I ended up just throwing it out."
5,"Buy The American Accent Guide, 2nd Edition","Be aware that The American Accent Guide, 2nd Edition, released in 2004, is an upgraded version of this book and features CDs instead of cassettes. It sells for $99.00. No need to pay $190.00 for an old, used version."
5,Great DVD,i am so happy this is coming out on DVD. I use to watch the show all the time. It is a great 80's show. It may be cheesy and people may talk bad about the show but you know they were watching it in the 80's.
5,JUST WHAT I WANTED,I ACTUALLY BOUGHT A LOT OF OLDER TYPE DVDS INCASE THE SHOW JUST SLOWLY DISAPPEARS. I GREW UP WITH THIS SHOW..ITS A CLASSIC AND I HOPE TO OWN EVERY SEASON SOON!! THEY NEED MORE SHOWS LIKE THIS NOW
2,Aaargggh!,"Only in the tacky eighties could Scott Baio have been a popular TV star! This show sucked so bad that anyone who remebers it fondly and plans to buy the DVD set must be mentally deficient! That being said, no offence intended to those who have ordered it. Enjoy, just don't tell your friends! :o)"
5,I love the 80's!!,"I love watching all the old episodes. If you were a child of the 80's and loved to watch Happy Days and Charles in Charge, then you will love these... Scott Baio is sooooo cute!! And I love the fact that the corkiness is so innocent and real. Total nostalgia."
3,Nice to be able to watch it again,"I loved this show when it was on ""back in the day"" so it was nice be able able to watch it again, but I was surprised that it was not the family I was used to seeing!!! I wasn't aware the family changed after season 1...the bonus episode makes me want the other seasons to see the episodes I was used too. It's still a great show I just think the dad in this was a bit lame and not very funny..."
4,Addicted,"I received this set as a gift, other than the theme song (which is very annoying)I love the show, It is about a college student who is hired to take care of three children while their parents are working.Charles has to balance school, work and friends.Charles has wisdom beyond his years (which makes it alot easier)and there are never tramatic or over the top problems, like on some shows we watch today.Overall Very clean with very few innapropriate references (very few, But I thought I would warn you.).I sleep with this show on most nights and I just love it."
1,Critical Theory,"Author doesn't explain the ""critical theories"" very well. Makes one have to go back over and over to get the point. I wish teachers would find another book to use."
3,Ugh. Theory.,"Theory sucks. But this book is all right. I did actually enjoy the way she applied every theory to The Great Gatsby. It's good enough for a lit theory text book. One of the better ones I've seen, actually. But come on, lit theory? Yuck."
5,Masters of Electronic do their spin on House Music,This album came at a time when techno-house was being force fed to me. I bought this album simply because it was the new Yello album and found an arsenal of superior tunes to unleash on the tribal ravers. What is so refreshing is that Yello left their weird tendencies behind to make a masterful clever cool grove sound.
5,Yello goes techno!,"After acquiring all of Yello's '80's albums that are readily available in the US, I got ""Zebra"" for Christmas 1995. My ears were freaking out! I couldn't believe how drastically different this album sounds compared to what you hear on ""Essential"" and everything else Yello has done in the past. But ""Zebra"" proves that when the musical times changed, so did Yello. Don't you just want to get up and shake your booty with ""Move, Dance, Be Born"" or ""Do It"" or even ""S.A.X.""?"
1,Soul Man DVD,"Personally, I wanted to return this dvd. Seems to be copied from a VHS possibly. Not really sure. However, it was cheap and my husband asked that I not. He really loves this movie for some odd and apparent reason. THe movie itself just seems to be of poor quality. It arrived before stated date. Shipped from UK (took about 3 weeks)and I live in Germany. However, that wasn't a problem for us."
4,Very intense + Quite a few suspenseful scenes + Convincingly depicting the courage and the fanaticism of French Resistance fig,"- This movie creates a very intense mood.- There are quite a few suspenseful scenes.- The actors convincingly depict the courage and the fanaticism of French Resistance fighters in WWII- It's inspired by true characters. The ending is factual but depressing.In short, it's definitely worth watching. I borrowed it from the local library."
3,Not bad for a small movie.,"This movie is about the various minority factions in France fighting German Occupation forces. I was surprised the movie was actually relatively well made for a small production. The reality is of course that these French underground forces, whether minorities or French, are vastly overblown. It is only as of the last several years that historians have assessed the actual number of German forces in France dedicated to dealing with the French resistance, the number of significant resistence incidents, etc.. The conclusion is that the French resistance story is a much better one in 1940s propaganda movies..........but in reality insignificant. There were countries such as Hungary, and later Russia, that mounted effective underground resistence. The French however were a bit too busy collaborating to find time to resist!"
2,Long and boring,"Compared w/ other resistance movie, Black Book and Army of Shadow, 2 stars is the highest it can get. BBC's Wish me luck is another much better one."
5,By far his best,"I have all the old vinyls and all the new cds, but non touch the live performance of Carlos on this album. This truly shows he is by far the greatest guitarist of all time. Hendrix was great, but he's dead!. Oh yeah, and shame on anyone who doesn't aggree that Santana live is better than any studio recording. And if this his his best live album, then this is his best album of all. I highly recomend. This is comming from a Carlos fan who's been listening to him since the beginning. Trust me you won't be dissapointed."
4,Musical maestros,"As with any live Santana album, this '90s recording of the band's concerts in Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico was best represented by its renditions of earlier classics. ""Gypsy Queen"" is the best thing they ever did, and the five-minute driving rhythms and dazzling, electrifying guitar soloing will mesmerize you once again. ""Soul Sacrifice"" is another always-great live experience, and the group weaves in and out in the middle-section soloing, drawing up The Doors' ""Light My Fire"" and Coltrane, as they often do. But in all the songs, earlier or later, the great instrumentation in all categories--guitar, keyboards, percussion--is a continuous joy. Hardly anyone can match this group in raw musicianship. Definitely recommended."
3,Lost in the mix,"3 1/2 stars really.the music is quite good, as so many other reviewers have stated. My beef?There isn't enough guitar, and what is there, is lost in the other instruments. I've seen Santana in concert several times, and the main reason for going, is his guitar. I recommend Lotus instead. Despite its technical flaws, Lotus is a better album overall."
3,no chance takin,"I had both video and cd on this performance, and they sound exactly the same.The main problem with this cd is that it is overdone and lacks any improvisation at times feeling like a Las Vegas show.That said, Carlos can still blend melodies into his classics,like Marvin Gaye's I want you into Europa,and Light my fire into Soul Sacrifice."
2,Santana's worst album?,"I find this album unlistenable, due to the cheesy synth sound prevalent in every track. Carlos' guitar playing is quite good, but the overall sound is one of synthetic 80's blandness, more appropriate to a New Age radio playlist. Vocals lack any of the soul of earlier Santana recordings. I'm selling my copy of this CD, and couldn't find a single track that I really wanted to extract and keep."
4,Good but not great,"Sacred Fire: Santana Live in South America is a nice recording of an early 90's Santana concert.The sound quality is first-rate.The musicians, while very good, are no match for the Santana band of the late 60's and early 70's.Of course, Carlos Santana's fiery guitar still has the power to carry the show.I didn't particularly care for a few of songs on this album (like Esperando and Make Someone Happy) but the renditions of their earlier works like ""Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen"" and ""Toussaint L'Overture"" are fantastic.Overall a rewarding musical experience but for the best live recording of a Santana performance I'll stick to ""Lotus""."
4,Pre-war thriller delivers,"Graham, a British engineer who specializes in munitions, becomes the target of German spies as he travels from Turkey to England in the months preceding WWII. He takes passage on a small boat, where many of his fellow passengers will reveal surprises about themselves and he will encounter both friends and foes in unexpected places.Eric Ambler's prose is efficient and graceful as he moves his plot along smoothly. His characters are delineated well, their interactions are well-focused, and the twists and turns in the plot are satisfying."
3,Eric Ambler was great for his time.,"Eric Ambler, as far as I can tell, wrote the original European espionage stories that took the reader to mysterious cities all over east and west Europe. However there is no over riding arc to his stories, no personal tension that is resolved at a climax before a denouement. It feels like he starts everyday writing by thinking of some complication that will only take him to the end of writing for that day. This genre of European spy story was developed by Graham Green and perfected by John Le Carre. This is what we thank Ambler for most of all."
5,Journet Into Fear,"Eric Ambler is one of the finest writers of mystery fiction. His inspiration to the field of adventure/mystery writing has been evident in the writings of LeCarre, Ludlum, et al. Journey into Fear is a short novel, as most of Amblers, and never lets you out of the story. I know I have read several of his and am never bored or lose interest. Journey Into Fear kept me reading till the end without ever allowing me to forget where I left off."
3,Hard to clean,I received this as a hand-me-down from a family member. It's really hard to clean the blue non-slip areas. I like the mesh. I actually ended up ditching the tub and using the mesh on a different tub that I liked more.
2,Should have read the reviews before I registered for this,"I dont know why I did not , I always read reviews but I was SO OBSESSED with my son having everything in either precious planet and i mean everything in his nursery I bought out the entire line. literally. Except for his rain forest tub and rain forest jumperoo. I love fisher price they make quality stuff or so i thought. Until he reached almost 4 months. His back digs intot he plastic piece in the middle and when i release the bottom part of them hammock he slips into water. Holding him up his whole back in ridiculous and should be unnecessary seeing as how this bath is a pretty penny. If I wanted to holding him up the entire time I would have bought a bucket. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS , it wont last. Only two stars because its such a cute tub"
1,NOT a good design!,"I hated this tub, and returned it after attempting to use it twice. The newborn sling has no support, and kept my baby completely out of the water and he got freezing cold. I tried it without the sling, and the ""infant"" seat part also keeps your baby completely above the water, with just their butt covered. I also found that no matter how tightly I tried to screw on the ""legs"" that you have to attach, they were still loose and wobbly."
2,Not so Great,"The day after bathing our son, I noticed an odor coming from the foam in the headrest. No matter what I do, short of drying the headrest in the dryer after every bath, the odor comes back. The foam sours and fills the entire bathroom with the odor. Also, there is a ""neck rest"" molded in the plastic for the 2nd stage of bathing. It is awkwardly placed and doesn't raise the head out of the water enough. Last, the tub does not drain unless you have the feet propped up on something. The opening is closed by the big bath tub. Not a great buy."
5,great tub,"This tub makes it so easy to bathe my infant. When she was a new born the sling came in handy. The tub has a ""bump"" that many people complain about. I like this bump because it makes a little seat for baby. I feel my daughter is safe and I don't have to worry about having slippery hands."
5,bathtub,perfect bathtub for our new born son. being a 1st time mommy i was scared of bathing him. but this helped me & helped me not being scared that he would fall into the water deeply where the water would be in his ears. so this was definitely the best bathtub for my son until about 6mths old
4,Bath tub is good,This bath tub is good. But somehow my baby never liked sitting in the bath tub for taking bath. May be some babies don't like taking bath..:o)
5,Well thought-out product,"Good design, easy to use for new mothers of newborns as the sling gives the baby support and mom less anxiety. Still useful as baby gets sturdier and mom gets more confident. Comfortable and well balanced with thoughtful little extras."
5,This is a great tub!!,"I don't understand some of these negative reviews, my daughter is now 4 months old and has used this tub since she was a newborn, the hammock and the tub itself is great. The smaller end with pillow provides great support for the baby"
2,Not great,Tub was not great or even all that good. A little bit of water and the material was cool very quickly. Thought my daughter was going to catch a cold.
5,"Solve the ""bump"" problem!!!!","This is a wonderful tub-- if you follow the instructions for the hammock. I've used it for two kids now. I am so tired of people giving things bad reviews when they are using the product wrong. The hammock part is for an infant up to 10 pounds. If your child is crying because of the ""bump"" and you can't get the hammock to tighten any further, then it is probably because the child is too big and needs to go onto stage two where the baby uses the hammock as a head rest, but sits on the incline of the tub. I actually put a picture of this position in the customer photos of the product. All of these reviews where the babies are bigger and still using a hammock is unsafe. Please read the directions before you use a product."
3,Not for long infants!,"At first this was a great tub, but by the time my baby was 12 weeks old we couldn't use it anymore. She was 22 inches long at birth and 25 1/2 at 12 weeks and she just didn't fit anymore. The problem is that the plastic seat bottom is rammed into her back when she is in the sling and she is way too long to lie directly in the tub on the infant end. The seat back is only 12 inches long and my infant's torso and head already measures 17 inches.In short, this is a great tub for a small light baby but doesn't work if your baby is long, so if you have alot of height in your family, stay away from it."
1,Not Worth the Money!,I bought this for my 2nd child simply b/c it was the most expensive ... so it had to be the best...right??? ... WRONG! The cheap basic one I had for my 1st child was much better! This one makes the baby sit really high out of the water and the baby quickly gets cold. Plus it left a large red mark on my sons back. He never seemed comfy in it! It was great while we used it for the baby sling but after that it was horrible!
2,Not for Newborns!,I thought the sling on this bathtub would be great for my newborn. My baby hates it. The sling sags (Baby is 8 lbs) and the bump in the middle of the tub digs into his back. I always wet the sling with warm water before I put him in but by the time I get him into the tub it is cold already. Overall this just doesn't work for my baby. I bought a cheap sponge mat that works for now. I'll try the other functions of the bathtub as my son gets older.
3,eh.,I was only really able to use this when my son was tiny. Like other reviewers stated the 'hump' in the middle is a definite design flaw! I had to sit my son's rear end in the smallest part of the tub when he got bigger... and now he's too big to lay down in it but not sitting up on his own yet. So the tub is useless to me now.Good points: I really like how colorful it is! Very durable! The mesh hammock is made well with a foam bumper and head rest!
2,Not as comfortable as it looks......,"I bought this for my newborn son who weighed 9-1, I used the sling for newborns but the ridge in the tub that is used for the baby's bottom (when they are bigger)pushed into my newborns back leaving welts!! So, when he turned about 3 months old (about 13 lbs) I took the infant sling out and used just the tub but also had problems. The back rest does not have a non-slip surface so you must be very careful or the small infant will just slide/ tip over to the side !!"
3,Baby loves it,"I got this at my baby shower. I like the hammock idea and she loves the toys. The only thing i dont like is the hump in the middle. It is good when you are using the hammock, but in three months when you take the hammock out, it seems like it would hurt a baby's back because it is hard and only holds the baby's mid back. So my daughter either has to sit above the hump which only allows her shins to be in the water or i have to hold her in the lower area. I just wish it was reclined instead of a bulky plastic hump in the middle of her back."
1,hated it!,"I received this tub as a gift off my registry, but hated it. Baby in the sling part made him cold because he did not touch the water. When he was old enough to go in the water, you had to hold him up while bathing. Not a convenient design.I sold it at a garage sale for $3. What a waste of $$$$."
4,Love it!!,This tub is great. Buy it. It makes bath time much easier. The hammock allows for just the right amount of water for newborns and infants baby.
1,Ridiculous Price,I was just about to buy this for a friend when I found it new on the Walmart website for $32. I'd much rather buy it 100% new for that amount of money than used for more than that. Ridiculous!
1,Bad Product,"I loved the idea and bought it without looking at reviews. My baby was born 6 pounds and this bath was great. BUT as soon as she reached 9 pounds I realized there is a ""bump"" in the middle of the bath that cuts into her back as I wash her.So this product is good for babies of less than 9 pounds!Bottom line, don't bother with this product."
1,good except for the bump,"My son was only able to use this tub for his first three months (and he was a premie - born at just over 5 pounds). After the first few months he became too heavy and his back rubbed on the bump. We took the net off, but then my arm hit the bump trying to keep my baby off it of. It was just really uncomfortable and awkward. I would not recommend anyone use this tub...there must be a better one out there."
2,bad design,"what a bad design. very uncomfotable, We put it in the garbage after two washes. Junk i would pay 1 red cert for this item"
2,Wish I could return it!,"I put this on my baby registry thinking it was going to work great! I wish I could go back in time. After bringing my daughter home I tried giving her a bath in it and it was just not a good experience. The sling gets really cold which of course is not good for the baby, the pillow is slippery and awkward, and the bump in the middle of the tub underneath the sling can dig into the babies back. My daughter did not look or act comfortable in this tub. I agree with an earlier review that it is ""not very functional"". The only thing I liked about it was the cute wash cups...thats it. Since I can't take it back, maybe it will be better once my daughter can sit up on her own. I would definitely not use this for infants again! Another parent suggested the bath sponge/foam and it works perfectly and my daughter is always happy during bath time. Sometimes simple is better!"
2,smelly,"This tub is adorable and I was so excited to get it. I loved the hammock idea and how comfy I thought my son would be in it, but he didn't really sit well in the hammock because the pillow to support his head kept moving around. Then I realized that I was going to have to wash the hammock comstantly because it gets smelly after getting wet and sitting for awhile, just like a wet towel. I didn't have time to keep putting it in the washing machine and most of the time I forgot and would go to do bath time and end up with a stinky hammock!"
2,Not a fan,"I liked the idea of this tub, but it just doesn't work for us. He keeps sliding down despite the sling and his ears will get in the water and there is a bump that I thought would be great to hold him up and in place, but you can tell he finds it incredibly uncomfortable. I usually end up sitting him above the bump so that he stays up out of the water. He also can get his arms tight next to his body and it's hard to move him to clean them because the tub gets in the way. He's now 6 weeks old."
2,Wouldn't Purchase Again,"My baby is 6 weeks old & I am already seeing an issue with the tub. When he is sitting in the newborn mesh part, his poor lil back is pressed by the HARD rubber piece in the inside of the tub (suppose to serve as a seat when he can hold his head up). He gets a red mark across his back, so I am in the market for another tub already..what a waste! I also question the saftey of the tub bc I could see it tipping backwards if his weight doesnt balance out with the seat part when he gets a lil heavier..hmmm..Dont go with this one..Trust Me!"
1,Don't buy,This bathtub was passed down to me by a co-worker that didn't like it either. I really liked the toys and thought it would be great but I was very disappointed. The sling did not fit a my newborn baby's body very well and when he was in the sling he did not sit in the water. So the whole time I was bathing him he was cold. Also my son is a pretty big baby and the sling sunk and his back was resting on the edge of the plastic that holds a sitting baby from slipping down so it was very uncomfortable for him. I tried to take the sling off and the seat position would only work for a baby who could sit upright.
2,I Thought I would Be Able To Use This Longer.,I bought this for my baby and thought it was awesome until she outgrew the sling which didn't take long at all. She cannot sit up on her own yet which means the tub is absolutely useless. I am throwing this out and buying something else. What a waste of money.
4,Great tub,We got this tub as a baby shower gift and couldn't be happier. Our baby is 11 months old and we still use it. She loves to play with the little cups that comes with the tub. The net was a very convenient way to bathe her until her umbilical cord came off.
2,Good in the beginning,This product was great with our daughter being a newborn and worked well when she was not at the point of sitting up. Now it is difficult to have her in the tub since she is just becoming able to sit up on her own. When she lays back she starts to slip down and the tub is not supportive enough for her to sit up by herself. I definately think its is great for newborns and younger infants but around the time my daughter turned 5 months the tub was not what she needed and we had to buy another.
1,Extremely Poor Design,"This tub is the worst infant tub I have ever used. When my daughter was a newborn the sling would keep her out of the water to where she would get cold easily. She also wasn't able to stay in the sling for more than a couple months because the tub has a plastic bar that would dig into her back. When I attempted to put her in the tub without the sling, leaning against the back of the tub, she would flop all over the place and the height of the lip of the tub came to just the right level for my three month old daughter to hit her head when she would try to sit up and then lay back again. I would not recommend this tub to anyone. It should be taken off the market. Don't waist your money."
5,Great Bathtub for babies up to 9 months...,"I was given this bathtub for a baby shower gift, and I loved it. The sling worked great for the first couple months until my daughter was too heavy for it, and by then she was ready to move to the reclining slope. Later when she was able to sit unsupported on her own, I could turn her around to the larger side. She is now 10 months old, and although I am still using this tub (it's been so convenient and easy on my back when place in our shower stall), it's not really deep enough and she wants to climb out of it now that she's discovered she can do that. She doesn't seem ready to be in the regular bathtub just yet, so I'm now looking for something bigger and deeper that would be a good transition tub."
4,an easy tub to use,I like this tub because it is roomy and allows me to put a foam pad in for his comfort. The bar in the middle is useless and you only use the sling for the first month. The cup for washing his hair is great and the attached fish is fun for him to chew on.
4,Great tub for newborn,"My son is four weeks old and he loves to be in this tub. I like the sling which keeps him secure, it drains really nice and overall I highly recommend this product. The only future issue I see is the size of it. My baby is not big but he is long (23 inches at birth) and his feet are already getting to the end of the sling, so I am not sure how much longer we will be able to use that."
3,Reasonably good for the first few months,"Great for giving a bath, since it acts as a mini-bathtub for the baby. Once the baby learns to sit upright, one can also remove the cloth part and use the plastic tub directly. Having said that, it would be much better if it came with more convenience features, such as a soap dish, or baby wash holder."
1,Doesn't work from 2-6 months,"I had the Safety First tub with my first baby and bought this when I had a boy, mostly for the colors. This is nowhere near as good as the Safety First. First, the newborn insert isn't big enough for big babies, my son outgrew it within 2 months. It's very poorly designed for a baby who isn't a newborn but can't quite sit up. There is nowhere for their head to go, no support, and my baby slumps over to the side. He's also easily able to kick himself out of the part that supports him under his butt, so if I look away for literally one second he's submerged over his face in water, it's extremely dangerous. It's a very awkward and uncomfortable position. When they do get old enough to sit up, half of the tub is dedicated to younger babies, so the space they have to play is much smaller.Get the Safety First with the newborn insert, you'll be much, much happier!"
3,It's a little annoying,"This tub drives me crazy and I have twin boys so I know it's not just a certain baby that doesn't work good in it. There is this weird lump in the middle where you can sit the baby (when he's too young to sit himself) but if the baby even squirms a tiny bit, he slids off the ""seat"" and then his back is smack in the middle of the lump and his face is about to go under. How would you like a huge hard lump in your back? The little cradle thing that comes with it is silly because it doesn't go down into the water far enough to actually submerge the baby, unless you lower it and then the baby is laying on the lump in the middle again. I wish the product pictures showed the lump thing better, it's always covered by the cradle part. We haven't bought another tub so it's obviously usable, which is why I rated it three stars but I wouldn't buy it again, nor suggest it."
2,Worked well for the first couple months.,"My daughter loved this tub for the first 2 1/2 months, it was one of the only ways I could calm her during the evening hours. Although, now that she is 3+ months it seems that 'the bump' located on the bottom of the tub is extremly uncomfortable. Bath time is no longer enjoyable for her as she arches her back to try and avoid the large plastic bump pressing against her back. I would not recommend this tub for babies over 13 pounds."
4,fisher price bath center,great producti feel its not tall enough and its impossible to put the whole body of the baby into the bathtub
2,Just doesn't work well for us,"We bought the whole rainforest line which is so cute but this just didn't work out for us. From the get go the hammock part never supported our son. His back would hit ackwardly on the hard plastic bump below meant for use with older babies. No matter how tight we got the straps he still sunk too far down. He was 7lbs 9 oz. when he was born and we've been using this since his cord fell off. He is just now at 2 months 10 lbs. so weight was not the issue. We've now tried a couple of times without the hammock attachment. It's better but still not great. He seems to slip side to side and it does seem pretty short, water spills over the back when we try to rinse his head. I wouldn't reccommend this tub. There may be better options but I say save your money for other things and do like we do, my husband takes him in the shower with him and he loves it :). We won't be trying any others."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I got this for my first baby thinking it looked so cute and came with extra toys and accessories. As some other reviewers have said, it was fine for the newborn stage. When it was time to use it without the hammock, the tub became fairly useless. It's very shallow and my son could almost roll out the side when he leaned over. Additionally, there is some assembly required. The piece that holds it onto the side of the sink has to be screwed on and it was always a little wobbly because of the way the screws went into the plastic.[...]"
2,There are better tubs out there.,"This is my second tub I have tried... first off, its only $30 at wal-mart, so if you're still interested, buy it there.There are a few problems with this tub:First, the pillow is useless- you can't wash the baby's hair when the pillow is there, and if you flip it up, it falls back down in the baby's face. I had to cut it off.Second, as the baby gets bigger and you still need to use the sling, her back hits the seat below and hurts her. I had to hold her up with one hand and bathe her with the other.So, I tried using the tub without the sling. She is only 2 months, but can lay it the tub/seat just fine. The only problem is that it doesnt seem comfortable for her, and her head rests higher than the seat, which means when I wash her hair, the water doesn't flow into the tub, but onto the counter instead.This tub only worked well for the first few weeks. Now I am off to find another!"
3,"Ok, except for the bump","I liked the tub at first, it's good for newborns. However, as she got older and weighed more, she started crying a lot in the bath. I took her out and noticed she had a big red mark on her back where the bump hit her. I tightened the straps as tight as possible, but it just stretches out again. I found that I had to put a towel there or hold her back so that it wouldn't be so uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't purchase this again."
2,Not worth the price,"This tub might be ok for newborns and older children but for the infant stage which is the longest it is terrble. The sling only gets secured to the top and when the whole thing gets wet it gets big and stretches out- causing baby to slide, causing their back to rest on the pertruding ""bump"" in the middle of the tub.Its going back- tried it twice and it was not a positive bathing experience."
4,Love it!,"I love this bathtub! The hammock made it really easy for our newborn. Now that he's 4 month old, we're using it only attached to one side. He doesn't slip and I can't wait until he can sit in the wider end of the tub and can enjoy the little ""cups"" and splash. I liked the tub so much I gave it already as a Shower Gift.One con, the bump, because it's not placed very great in the tub, so that he sits very high, which makes washing the hair a bit harder. If he lies down, the bump sticks in his back, but it's manageable. Tub on the wider end is bigger than other tubs though, which is a plus."
3,"Cute, but overpriced","We used this baby bathtub for our newborn when he was little. Like most baby bathtubs, he grew out of it really fast. I was glad I purchased this second-hand, instead of paying full price for it.The neatest looking aspect of this tub is the suspended mesh mat. However, unless your house is 75 degrees or more, it's probably too cold to have a newborn baby suspended in the air like this. I felt better just having my newborn on a towel on the kitchen table, where I could keep him covered except for the small area I was sponge bathing at that moment. When he was a little larger & I could submerge him in water (after his umbilical cord fell off & healed), I used the main part of the tub. However, it was usually just as easy to clean out the kitchen sink & use that."
3,"Great for newborns, not so great for the in-between stage!","I loved this bath when we received it for a shower gift. It was cute, bright colors, and the hammock was easy and comfortable for my baby. Since my baby outgrew the hammock but can't sit up on her own, it is ackward with this weird bump that gets in the way and does not seem to fit. I even went back and reviewed the diagrams to make sure I was doing it correctly. It is also hard for my child to have her hair rinsed with the angle that it fits over the sink. She has a lot more hair than the average baby but it should have still been considered when created. It seems like for the third stage it will be just fine, however, I am not sure my tolerance for the tub will last that long in the current stage we are in."
3,I was expecting it bigger,"I didn't t think the bath was this small, my 5 months old boy already grown out of it and I just received it :("
4,Cute bath tub - Very BIG!!,"Like the head cushion...lots of room in tub, however tub itself is very big and takes up a lot of space."
2,Not good for big babies,"My almost 5 month old is in the 100% for height and weight - so she is a big girl. I bought this tub because she is too big to fit in the bathroom sink. She cannot yet sit up on her on, so I needed something with support. I thought this would be perfect...but its not. She is too big for the Level 2 side - where she can sit on the little shelf and recline. And she can't totally sit up on her own in the tub side. This tub also slides all over the bathtub, so now I have to hang on to the baby and to the tub just to try to get her clean. Its gotten to the point where the baby will just scream bloody murder when she is on the shelf side. Last night was better because I tried to prop her up on the other side, but it didn't work that well either. If you have a small baby, I'm sure this tub is fine. But, with a larger sized baby, it does not work at all."
1,Not Happy Nor My Son !!! whats with the bump,"My Newborn baby(who came long and about 8 pounds) dropped in the sling to the bottom hitting the stupid bump and when we remove the sling the stupid bump made it 'again' hard for us to adjust our son in the tub , this tub is not right for you if ur baby isn't small or tiny !We are not pleased with this tub Surely because of the BUMP!! it might be a good tub if the remove the bump and change the quality of the sling to make tighter so it will be much safer"
2,Great....for a couple of weeks!,"This tub worked fine when my baby could sit in the sling, but the sling only holds up to 10 pounds! Once he got too heavy, he was sinking down and his back was on the hard ledge and he was extremely uncomfortable. Now I have to try to balance him on this shallow ledge, which he is constantly sliding off of-I have to catch him slipping into the water and re-position him over and over. It makes bathtime very frustrating for both of us; I'm going to have to buy another tub because I can't deal with this until he starts sitting up.Common sense dictates that you should never turn your back on a baby in the bath, but with this tub, your baby could kick or squirm and be in the water in a fraction of a second. I feel this tub is downright dangerous to use with an infant over 10 pounds who can't sit up on their own."
2,Too small and weird bump,I got this tub for our newborn. He came out long and big so the sling just drops to the bottom. we remove the sling and he looks so uncomfortable with the bump right in the middle. His head was above the tub lying down as well. This is probably great for a smaller baby. We used it twice and ordered the whale tub which has a removable bump so he can use it longer. He is now 8 months and we are still using it with the bump.
2,Good for newborn and sitting infant...not for inbetween!,"Loved this at first using the sling with my newborn. Up until he weighed too much for the sling(10 1/2 lbs). The ""bump"" in the bottom of the tub proved to be a huge problem. It is supposed to support them after they outgrow the sling but it sits them too high up and his head would bob back & forth. We soon retired the tub soon after we bought it. Very unsatisfied with this purchase. He now happily takes his bath on a big towel in regular tub with couple inches of water. Splashes and kicks to his delight. Wish I could have saved the money buying this fisher price tub."
3,An ok tub,While this does serve it's purpose in allowing me to bathe my 3-month old I'm not really crazy about the design of it. If you sit her on the shallow infant side she is hardly covered by any of the water - really just her legs and bottom - and quickly gets cold. If I sit her down at the deeper end she has very little leg room because there is the bump in the way that is where they sit at the shallow end so she's constantly kicking and pushing against it and I have to hang on to her tightly.I'm considering buying another tub to use until she's big enough to bathe in a regular bathtub.
3,Infant tub,"We stopped using this tub when my daughter was about 2.5 months old (by then she was rolling front to back, back to front, both ways and was pretty much too tall for it). She had essentially outgrown it and it was just easier to get a foam pad and let her play with us in the regular tub with only a little water (easier too as one of us could be IN the tub, and another beside it).However, for the first 2 months it was great, especially for new parents who may be tentative with their infant. You don't have to use much water, and the sling is very useful while the infants are still very small.Could we have passed and just used the regular tub or large foam sponge? Probably. And I'm sure some babies will get more use out of it than others (ours is rather tall for her age). At this point it's just taking up storage space, but we'll probably pull it back out for the 1st few months of our next child."
2,Next time I would not buy it,"Fisher-Price Aquarium Bath CenterI used it but I must agree when baby was getting older (4-5 months) it became very clear that it was not the best choice. The insert is always cold (hammock), temperature varies between Baby's butt and feet, because it is just simply deeper and more water goes into the feet area.Space for sitting child is extremely tight.Considering buying another(!) tub..."
1,Aweful product ! .... Brainless stupid creator!,"Whoever created this item needs their head examined. I am a grandmother 64 yrs old, and have given lots of infants a bath in my lifetime. There is a plastic hump in the middle of this aquarium tub. So even if you put the infant on top of the hammock, the infant's back HITS this hard plastic hump underneath it. Another thing: having an infant high up away from warm water is going to make the infant cry from being so cold! So if you are going to wash your infant using this hammock, be prepared to support the infant's back with one hand while washing it with the other hand with a screaming baby! Even if you take the hammock off, where do you put an older infant 3 months old? The whole contraption is a pile of junk. Just buy a regular infant body sponge and a regular oval plastic tub to wash your infant in."
2,Not the Best Tub,"This tub was great for my son when he was a newborn but once he outgrew the sling it was horrible! He was too big for the sling but not able to sit on his own yet. Because of the design of this tub and it's lack of padding or support, he kept slipping and sliding around making it impossible to wash him because it took 2 hands just to hold him up. Now I have to buy another tub. I wish I had never bought this one. There are much better tubs out there - Don't waste your money."
2,horrible design,there is a bump that sits right below the baby and hits them in the back. i never write these reviews but this bath is horribly designed. there are better choices for sure..
1,Disappointing,I agree with the earlier reviews. We were also sold out on the sling. Just as we were to give the baby bath we noticed the bump right in the middle of the tub. The picture on the instructions appears as if the baby is on the sling and is deceptive. Buyers beware of this tub.
2,"Great for 1 month, terrible after that","This was great for baths for the first month when he would fit in the sling. Starting at 2 months old he was too big for the sling but the ""seat"" or whatever the bump is under the sling was completely useless for him. If we had the sling attached at the bottom his feet would get caught on the edge and his back sunk down into the bump. If we detached the bottom two straps of the sling then first of all it just got in the way and either he would lie with the bump in his back or he would be 90% out of the water with his head above the headrest."
3,Okay,"The tub is okay, nothing great, but get's the job done. I liked the newborn stage, but the little hump in the tub would leave a mark on his back, so I put a rolled up face towel so it wouldn't hurt him. I'm currently in the in between stage, where he sits up on the ledge leaning on the hammock. His upper body is more out of the body than I would like, but he doesn't seem to mind. The tub looks spacious enough for the next stage, when he can sit up on his own. So looking forward to that."
2,Ok but smelly,"It worked out great for the first few bath but then I noticed the ""hammock"" it started to get a nasty dishrag smell. I had to put it in the washing machine after every use. Then after about 2 months of that no matter what I did the smell never went away. My daught is 5 months now and we have been usung it without the hammock part for about 2 months now but she is too big for it. Also when she is in it she seems to be too far above the water only the bottom of her bum sits in the water and she gets cold even with the heater on.It was ok for the time being but I will be buying a new one very soon. I wouldn't reccomend it"
1,Worst Tub for Baby I ever used!,"To the people saying that you can remove the bump in the middle, you cannot, at least on the model I have that is about 3 years old. I am not even sure they make a newer model with no bump for this aquarium theme. I DO however like the Fisher Price whale of a tub, THAT one does have a removable bummp that sits lower inside the tub, so the baby is in warm water and is much happier. But at first - newborn up until 3 months all you really need is one of those bath sponges they sell at walmart or kmart in the baby section for like $5, they are soft and get the job done."
3,Not so great for larger baby,"This tub was wonderful for the first 4 months or so. My baby could recline on the one side and the tub fit nicely over the kitchen sink--so no bending over. As my child got older (but was still unable to sit on his own), the tub wasn't so wonderful. He was too big for the reclining area, but slipped around on the other ""seating"" side because there isn't a non-slip surface on that side. I thought about putting some of those non-slip tub stickers on the bottom, but ended up getting him a different seat for the big bath tub because the bump in the middle of this tub was getting in the way. The toys, however, were nice and we still use them."
5,Must have book if you work with a computer!,Very usefull book when you are having trouble understanding what your computer is doing now!
4,Reader...Well,"Please note, this story ""Moonlight Midnight Glory"" was originally written as a Sailor Moon story. The names and places were changed to make them my characters. I could not use Naoko Takeuchi's characters to publish my book. However, the content is original...hope that helps any other reviewers out there. Michelle Harris aka Lady M. Harris."
3,Well....,"I would have enjoyed this book a lot had I not been a fan and read multiple forms of Sailor Moon fanfic. There were just too many similarities ... Jupiter Kingdom compared to Moon Kingdom, and so on. While the names Jaric and Elyssa don't resemble Endymion and Serenity, that was not true of some of the others. It didn't help very much either than these characters resembled their Sailor Moon counterparts. Michelle Harris has a lot of talent, I really did enjoy the story and she's a wonderful writer. But my problem is that this story did not strike me as original. The plot itself was, but the setting and the characters seemed borrowed. I felt like I was for all-practical purposes reading a Sailor Moon fanfic. I didn't get that sense at all when I picked up Sensual Healing, which made me get this. As a result, I was disappointed. No offense is intended and this is my personal opinion."
1,"OFFENSIVE TO ABUSED SPOUSES, Promotes abuse, Do not buy this if you are trying to heal an abusive relationship","I have never thrown a book away but i literally threw this away. Let me save you $8 and 200 pages: the just of the book is, convice yourself everything is your fault even your partner cheating on you, tell your partner everything is your fault and they are totally right in any and all mistreatment of you and this should work to smooth things over...eventually. WTF?? Literal line from the book ""I admited that it was my fault that he cheated on me because i must not have done something right or he wouldnt have felt the need to cheat."" WTF??? This is so offensive to abused partners that I was revolted. Yes tell your cheating abuser that he is 100% right, let him have his way, ignore your own self, and everything will work out. NO WAY. This author is the devil and he has no regard for the dangerousness for his 'advice' to battered spouses"
3,Shower Gel,"I was disappointed because this shower gel smells nothing like the perfume which I love! It smells good, just not like the perfume. Disappointed."
1,A rip-off,"As die hard Nine Inch Nails fans no doubt know, collecting ""Halos"" comes with the territory. However, out of all the single releases carrying the Halo label to be released, none has ever been as much as a rip-off as ""Survivalism, Part 1"". Featuring the ""Year Zero"" album version as well as the Tardusted Remix (which actually may be better than the normal track), ""Survivalism"" as a whole isn't a bad song one bit, and this rating does not reflect the song itself. Besides the two versions of the song, there is nothing else included on this disc at all. That's right, and remember, there is also a ""Survivalism, Part 2"" that features all of the above plus more, so if you haven't gotten the drift yet, you are getting ripped off. As a previous reviewer already mentioned, no matter how much of a die hard Nine Inch Nails fan or Halo collector you might be, do not pick this disc up. Pick up ""Survivalism, Part 2"" instead if you must, and leave this disc on the shelf."
1,Are you serious?,"Unless you are a DIE HARD collector, do not buy this. Both tracks are on part 2 (which is a halo, and which in no way does the disc or case mention being a ""part"" of any set) as well as an additional remix track. Comes with the video and a rather nice looking case. If you buy part 1, leave it in the plastic and forget you have it for about 5 years."
4,go green recycle and reuse. Great dog toy,Its soft rubber so not for heavy chewer but it bounces great and is fun to play with. Great merchant
5,A Comprehensive Informative Book,"This is truly a comprehensive, informative book. It teaches the beginners everything related to feminism in easy comprehensive language. It tackles all subjects related to feminism the history of various feminisms, antifeminism, post feminism, the impact of globalization on feminism and female laborers in the developing world. The book also tackles feminism in the U.S. the book also traces the influences of gender, class, race and culture and how they are interrelated. It is very helpful for beginner reseachers. It is worth buying and reading it."
3,A Brief History of U.S feminism,"I was quite excited to see this book, rather disappointed to read it, although it is a daunting task to undertake. Freedman naturally does not go much farther that the USA with occasional forays in to Europe for her discussions, so it really should be a history of US feminism, but that is expected (after all the US has a World Series for only USA teams!)A good preliminary discussion for those now approaching the debate, a good book to gain a panoramic view the issues of the last thirty years.If you are a well read and informed feminist, there is nothing new or exciting, and nothing in enough detail to make this a must for your shelf."
2,Not a history of feminism,"This book's title suggests that it is a history of feminism. This is not true. Feminism is a social movment, but this book contains no analysis of the means by which women were able to achieve greater rights in the political and economic system. Rather, it is an overview of the times and places in which women obtained various rights. There is no mention of what strategies women employed in order to organize and demand these rights. Reading Freedman's book, it seems as if these rights were granted by a benevolent state or court system, not that they were the outcomes of organized efforts by women. This book is completely descriptive and contains no analysis whatsoever."
4,A NICE START,"Tanya Blount was in SISTER ACT II, where she performed a stellar version of ""His eye is on the sparrow""(with the great Lauryn Hill)She has a strong voice and is enthusiastic. ""Through the rain"" is the big single on the album. It is a tender ballad and shows her to be a talented vocalist for her age at that time. The song features background vocals by Stacey Lattisaw! Tonya does a rousing remake of LTD's ""Love Ballad"". A song that is not easy for just anyone to remake. She does a splendid job. Another catchy single ""Im gonna make u mine"" did not fare as well, but is just as good nonethelessOther standout tracks are ""Is it Love""?, a duet with Freddie Jackson and the song ""No more Lies"". A truly talented singer who should definitely find a home on a label that believes in great singers. She should be heard and you should give her a listen!"
4,Excellent Historical Fiction,"Possibly Chris Hunt's best novel. A moving and believable fictionalized account of the relationship between King Edward II and Piers Gaveston. The author's careful attention to detail transports the reader into Medieval Britain, and his masterful handling of the events of Edward's life makes it difficult to leave. I read this book in all of two days. Highly recommended."
1,Gaveston by Chris Hunt,"It reads more like a Harlequin romance novel and portrays King Edward II as a silly, effeminate, swooning, schoolgirl (which, by all documented historical accounts he wasn't). A very disappointing book."
3,AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL FMK578 Amer Intl Install Kit &,"Kit has everything the description says but neglects to say it is for a two piece stereo system with the controls in the dash and the amp under the seat or in the trunk. Consequently, it didn't have the connector I needed with my one piece stereo. Until I find that connector my new stereo will stay in the box."
4,"Pretty good, though some of the essays are a stretch","I really enjoyed reading essays that brought the perspective of philosophy to bear on my favorite TV show. Not all the essays were good (one near the end with a lot of Freud was pretty awful), but many were, and when I rewatch episodes now I get completely different perspectives on things. I will add that I find other Buffy anthologies to be more helpful than this one."
5,Buffytastic!,"For those familiar with the series, I recommend reading this book and then rewatching the series. It will add to your observation and level of appreciation for the depth and complexities of this series. I don't agree with every interpretation presented in this book, but I enjoyed thinking about familiar characters in new ways and forming my own opinions."
5,Scorsese Brilliance!,"I hunted high and low for this film after seeing it years ago on the Sundance Channel. I found it at an obscure online movie rental site and have the VHS version of it. I will definitely buy this, and here's why:Not every body knows about the problems in Tibet and many do not understand His Holiness and how he can have compassion for all life forms, not only human. Every living being has the potential of being a human, the ultimate life form; not for reasons many think. Every sentient being has a consciousness and it's the MIND associated with the consciousness which holds this potential to develop.This film not only shows how it was made, but gives insight into His Holiness' family, how he was raised, how he loves his Tibet and I say everyone should buy this film to support more of these films to be made. I also suggest buying Kundun as it makes a perfect set, the film and the extras on it's own disc."
2,Inauthentic - I agree,"I like the musical ideas in this CD, but I do not like the execution. It sounds like I am listening to a demo rather than a finished album. The grooves and feel are there but it gets lost in the muddle of harsh mixing. I agree with the earlier reviewer who criticized the synth horns as it does make a difference on this album especially given the other problems. The reason groups like Theivery Corporation and the like are so good is that there is an organic feel to the music despite the use of electronics. On Heavens, rather than a warm full sound, there is just mashed layers of harsh, blunt electronics.I suspect this is a matter of needing a more experienced engineer on the CD. First albums are usually rough and maybe The Murgatroyd Trio can get the bugs worked out and shine in forthcoming releases."
3,Nice feel but a little inauthentic,"If one lets this music flow along in the background or at a party it has a nice vibe. However listen closely and you'll find that the group uses synthesized horns. In my opinion that's ok in a pinch, but for a studio recording I think it's a little cheap. There are so many great horn players who could have tuned into the Trio's hip-darkdance feel and made those pieces shine."
5,With these reviews...,"I came across this one through a link, and based on the rave reviews I ordered one. I gotta say, they were spot on. This CD has some cool grooves, I really dig '18 Karat' Played it until my girlfriend got mad. Excellent!"
4,Looks great,"This mailbox looks great and was easy to install. Since we have not yet moved into the home where the mailbox is located, I can't tell if it works well for what I bought it for - books and prescriptions. The only mail we received in it so far is junk mail and grocery ads. I think it will work just fine."
4,Super Reader,"The Rhine Institute's work lead to humans having a larger and larger number of fully functional telepaths and espers among them.Now, the worst disease around is caused Mekstrom's. However, one of the effects on the disease is flesh transformations, and if victims lived, they would be superhumanly strong, resistant to damage, and live many times longer.When Steve Cornell has a car accident and his fiance to be disappears, he is stuck in a conspiracy theory, and finds out about the Highways In Hiding, and a secret battle between two groups that have a higher level of knowledge about Mekstrom's disease, and a cure.A superhuman underground that wants good for the general population, and those that want to be a superhuman elite have their own covert struggle happening, and Steve becomes a key player."
2,I was surprised by the format,"I had read this book as a teenager and when I saw the generic cover I did not even think to check further. When it arrived it was the size of a school notebook (8.5x11) and printed with ink so light that I had difficulty reading it. It was the same book, just printed as if it was a draft to be read and marked by an editor.I am older and my eyes don't see as they used to so I will not buy books in this format again."
5,The rebirth keeps getting better. My Favorite,"Most of the music from the rebirth series have been jazz based, (so to speak) vol. 4 is decidedly club based. Many of the songs on this CD have a very club/trance like sound. But the music is exceptional. From begingin to end the tracks on this CD are all excellentListening to this Cd made me seek out the music by the individual arts. The sultry Underwater love starts vol. 4 off on a strong note. The music actually makes you feel as though you are under water. Another track that really stands out is the magnificent To Forgive or Forget. I never heard a violin used in club music. Cottonwol is another absolutely splendid track with its' distorted vocals and space age sound effects. Other strong cuts are Migration, Ponteio, who could it be now and my personal favorite Bittersweet. Well worth it for the adventerous listener."
3,The Rebirth Of Cool Volume 4,"This series is one of the more ""boutique"" ,selective compilations I have heard - I like most of the tracks as opposed other compilations where there are 1-3 stand out tracks and the rest are fillers. I still find it a little on the ""generic side"" for it to become an absolute favourite and I have given it a lesser rating than the predicted rating, based on this."
5,utterly amazing symphonic avant-garde progressive metal,"Oh yeah, it's ""post-black"" too. This album sounds like the accompanying music for a masquerade ball for the undead. Not since Opeth's first two albums has metal seen anything this original and gripping. Virtuoso piano strains flit in and out of a dense atmosphere raised up by mesmerizing electric guitar progressions and insane violin arrangements that only H.P. Lovecraft could describe with justice. If you heard this was ""something different"" or even ""bizarre,"" don't let that turn you off. Despite the strangeness, this is beautiful--nay, gorgeous--music. Warm melodies seem to spill effortlessly forth from the caustic brew. My only small gripe is against the Moonspell-ish vocals, which are neither black screams nor a haunting gothic baritone, but somewhere in between. Nevertheless, they do strangely seem to complement the instruments."
5,Never heard nothing like this.,"Arcturus are a breath of fresh air in the metal scene. They are great composers and great musicians, they are creative, different, and this record is uniquely brilliant. I'm a Moonspell fan, but Arcturus conquered my heart. Try this record!"
5,a weird masterpiece,"This album is beyond anything, even the band's previous album. Amazingly, this Norwegian semi-supergroup may be pioneering an entirely new sound, something unusual in these days when nearly everything's been done before. The only things I can compare this album to are Ulver (for which Arcturus vocalist Garm also sings) and American avant-garde weirdos Mr. Bungle. The band shares it's cold, dark atmosphere and symphonic aspirations with black metal, but otherwise doesn't resemble rock at all. It's sort of like opera composed on heroin. A variety of instruments are thrown in the mix, and each song is its own, although the entire album is integrated conceptually. The lyrics are as intriguing and intelligent as the music, and are sung in a clear, strong manner, utilizing unconventional yet compelling melodies. It's a crime that this album is so obscure and unavailable in the U.S., but it's definitely worth the 20-30 bucks you have to pay for it. A masterpiece."
3,"Packaging way overdone, get out screwdriver just to unpackage!","The only bad thing with this toy is the packaging, just to get it out of the carton I had to search my entire house for a thin screwdriver because the regular ones are too thick! No idea why 8 screws are needed for one tiny little car??"
5,My 4 yr. old son loves it!!!,"My 4 yr. old son loves this toy! He's all boy and loves to crash his cars. Somehow, this has survived him 2 months so far. Most toys do not even last 2 weeks. He loves the sounds and the movements it makes. It has even survived a bath in the sink. I would suggest this toy to anyone who loves cars."
3,"ugly, but effective.","I bought some adorable puffer fish for my aquarium, but the little devils enjoy attacking other fish, so I had to either isolate them, or find them a new home. I saw this item and figured I'd give it a try. Easy to assemble and set up, but absolutely ugly in the aquarium. The side guards are an ugly black and really take away from the natural look of the aquarium. A solid piece of plexiglass with holes would have been preferable, but as a cheap quick fix, this works all right. Now the gourami and pleco can sleep soundly at night knowing their butts aren't being chewed on."
1,Not What I Ordered...,"I just established an aquarium and wasn't sure what I wanted description wise-however picture wise this was EXACTLY what I needed to fix the problem I was having with a troublesome fish-it was also a cue I was taking from other tank owners when it came to aggressive fish. However when the product arrived it was not at all what was in the picture. Now I have this useless item that will not fit on my uniquely designed tank-however my problem is still not fixed-hopefully this company plans on making things right as I see a lot of products I wouldn't mind purchasing-but will DEFINITELY forgo if my money isn't refunded and/or a new ""SPECIMEN CONTAINER"" for a 15-20 gallon tank arrives at my address. Thanks."
2,Aquarium divider - needs to return to old style,I own an older divider which uses a stiff plastic divider which stays in place much better. The screen on this unit wants to come out of the side supports and sets your fish back into the main tank. We spent the better part of two hours before finally getting the divider in place. I would certianly look for a divider with a stiffer center piece the next time. Perhaps someone knows the secret to holding the screen in place.
4,Saved a cichlid's life,I'm down to 2 very large cichlids and one of the them terrorizes the other. We put the fish divider into my 55 gallon tank and no more fish fights. The only complaint I have (as it is mentioned by other purchasers) is that you have to move the gravel up against it to help keep it in place. Cichilds love to move rocks & gravel around so I have to keep pushing the rocks up against the bottom of the screen so they don't try to go under it to get to the other fish and start another fish war.
1,not worth what you get,I had a lot of problems with this product and I ended up returning it anyway. Other than the poor service I received the main problem with the product I had was that the metal hooks forced the frame to stick up out of the aquarium too far that I couldn't put the hood back on. So really this product was useless for me anyway.
4,good one from Etta,"Etta James is in fine form singing on this CD, not a weak song on the whole album. Great backup playing, good song selections and arrangements. Any fan of Etta James will enjoy this CD."
3,Good collection of synth-pop tunes.,"Visage is a pretty cool band. Their musicianship and songwriting skills are good. This hits package is listenable and satisfying. There's a total of twelve tracks, and all of them are in a synth-pop musical direction. The singer does a nice job with the vocal duties, and the keyboards sound tight. All of the tracks are pretty good. My favorite songs are both versions of ""Fade to Grey"" and ""Love Glove."" The CD booklet also contains a biography of the band. Worth a listen."
2,Not The Most Interesting Hit's Package,"I heard something about this band somewhere, so I picked this up around a year or so ago. While this hit's package is not terrible, it's not that good either. Most of the songs are forgettable and don't leave a big impression. The only tunes that are worth listening to are the two different versions of ""We Fade to Grey,"" and the song ""Love Glove."" Almost all of the songs don't sound like hits."
3,it had potential,"The book offered great laughs, but presented little as far as real-life applications went. The biggest problem was that the targets were of too strange a diversity... marina, bailbondsman, programmer, rancher, kennel... people against who extracting revenge would be as pointless as shoveling air. On top the the overly strange ""marks"", the letters all require that one know QUITE A BIT of information on his 'mark' before being able to even write the letter. The book would have been better had it focussed on more usual targets (ie. neighbor, co-worker, etc.) on whom gathering information is easy, and special letterheads or forged signatures are not required. Unless you want to get even with a zoo, nuclear control agency, museum, or band member, this book is worth little. I am now ordering Wade's earlier book ""poison pen letters"" in hopes that it will feature more of his ""generic target"" letters, of which this book only contains 2 :(I give this book 5.5/10"
4,Great for Special Occasions,"The real value of this DVD is that it gives you ideas of what delicious raw foods you can prepare when you invite people for dinner, or go to parties, potlucks etc. Maybe you just want to have something special for your birthday :) You don't need to feel deprived with so many food ideas. At first I thought I would seldom use these recipes because they seem so rich, but in a few short weeks I have used several ideas already. So I'm really glad I got both DVDs, even though I think that once I have mastered the techniques I will probably watch this DVD less than #1. It's a good one to share with friends after they compliment you on your scrumptious fruit pies!"
5,Excellent!!!,"Of all the plethora of books, magazines, articles, web information, etc. that I have collected over the last couple of years, Frederic Patenaude's recently released DVD/Part 2 is by FAR the best information I've received so far. Simple, to the point and easy to follow, this DVD is a pleasure to watch and helps you easily incorporate the raw food diet as your normal lifestyle. Many thanks--I can't wait for the next ones to come out!!"
3,Great seminar but sub-par amateur video taping,"the 2 stars taken are :1. poor video taping - sub-par amateur quality.2. price relative to the poor quality of the DvD which even blacks out in the middle of the viewing for a few seconds.but fujiwara is great. while his English is poor but he made it up with continuous techniques demonstrating; he did not hold back any. he is also a very funny guy so in spite of the poor quality of the taping, he kept it very entertaining. no one will get bore with a teacher liked fujiwara.dick is the opposite. he wore a whistle on his neck, he is a classic high school typed wrestling coach yet he is very approachable. while he claimed that he lost his agility due to his senior age, but i truly believe he can choke any grown men out if he wishes. he taught a few old classic catch wrestling techniquesAwesome teaching from both !"
2,Murder on Washington Square,The book was not as good as I thought it would be.I was looking for someting along the Emily Brightwell lines. Service was great though.
4,Good Job,"Nice addition to the series. The plot is a bit obvious at times, but moves along nicely and the characters are developed well. Recommend"
4,Best of the Series,"Thompson is getting the hang of mystery writing. This is an enjoyable book, more for the look into turn-of-the-century New York than the mystery. I especially like the hint that Brandt may someday find some closure to the death of her husband.I hope Thompson refrains from coupling Brandt and Molloy. I'd rather see a better developed mystery than read about two blushing social opposites at the turn of the twentieth century."
5,An eye opener for the blind,"If you are still under some delusion that the UN is anything but the most corrupt, inept, and ineffective organization in the history of modern society, you need to read this book. Admittedly I have worked with several of the members of the current hierarchy of the UN, so I may be somewhat prejudiced because i know from experience that they are beyond hope, but Sanjuan writes about previous regimes, and doesn't get into the current band of incompetents who waste billions of dollars every year in the name of ""peace"" while doing nothing but prevent proper oversight of programs which only enable tyrants and criminals to continue their corrupt raping and pillaging of nations all over the globe. The sad part of this book is that it does not include the most recent revelations of the Anan regime, where billions in the ""oil for fraud"" programs were siphoned off by criminals grand and petty without regard to the original mission and idealism of the UN."
2,"Interesting, but no depth","This is a good average book. Nothing special. We all know the Un is a cesspit of pond dwelling scum so what does this book add?Not much... some details, some more depth. I think the author owes it to the american taxpayer to add a chapter on ""How to Fix the Mess"". Then it may become a very good book. I found reading the last couple of chapters a bit boring. In the end this book is just 'A brief History of My Time at the UN""."
4,"Good sound, mediocre ergonomics","We bought the Jabra BT125 and the more expensive Plantronics Discovery 610 at about 6 months ago. The Jabra has better sound quality and volume for both listening and talking, but the Plantronics fits better and is more durable. It fits tigely in the ear canal and has a durable wire over the ear band that is comfortable. I find i have to keep fiddling with it to get a tight fit it he ear canal so i can hear well. The Jabra rides loosely on the ear and the ear band broke after several months of use. 5 new bands cost $7+$4 shipping = $11. I prefer the Jabra, and my wife prefers the Plantronics. If possible, try on the Jabra. If its looseness doesn't bother you, go with it."
3,A Promising New Author,"In the Midst of Deceit is a first novel. In my opinion, the beginning stutters just a little, but the story and the writing both grow stronger throughout the book.Piccurelli has a gift that will only get better with time. I encourage you to consider getting in on the ""ground floor"" in experiencing her storytelling."
5,In The Midst of Deceit,"As a partner in a financial management firm, Slade Mitchell has discovered a mysterious computer file that makes him wonder about the company's integrity. A few days later he is in a sky diving accident that almost kills him and leaves him in a wheelchair.Slade feels abandoned by his partners and friends and plunges into a deep sea of insecurity and loneliness. Stasi Courtland, his neighbor offers friendship and encouragement, but Stasi is a Christian and Slade long ago rejected that lifestyle.As Slade, who suffered a mental lapse from his injuries, starts to regain his memory, he realizes the sky diving incident might not have been an accident.Now he and Stasi must work together to quickly find the people who are attempting to kill him before it is too late. An entertaining and spiritually uplifting story and one you'll enjoy reading"
1,One good thing......,I can honestly say the best thing about this album is that it's only 4 songs. The music rocks on this album but the singer is just plain bad. I mean really bad. The basslines are great tho.
1,Not good!,"I borrowed this CD from a friend. I didn't like it. The guitar player is ok, but the drummer is kinda slow. The bass player is even slower. He/she must be a beginner. Oh well, at least I tried to listen to it."
2,haven't I heard this before?,"This ep is just alright. It takes a few listens to grow on you. And even the its not very memorable. The beats are okay, as is the bass. But over all one is better off listening to Hot Hot Heat or Interpol(whom they opened for in L.A.)"
1,Monotonous,"This band is made up of three 40 yr olds and they're good for their ages. I'm only guessing they're that old because they appear to be that old on some of the websites. I bought this album after hearing it on underground radio. It sounded a lot better when I only listened to it only once. I think I'd rather listen to a beached whale. The singer is very ""wanna be British"". I wish the sound quality on this CD was better, it sounds like it was recorded in my basement. This band would be great for the backdrop in Britney Spears next movie. I wish all the songs didn't sound exactly the same, good thing it's only 15 minutes. Can you say monotonous? That's the word that summarizes it best."
1,Skip it....,"I saw these three balding guys at the Glass House. I'm so glad I had a few drinks. This band was hot a few months ago but the shows have really started to thin out. As bad as this EP is they're worse live. The lead singer really is bad. I'd rather listen to the emergency broadcast signal. I have heard worse bands though, but do high school marching ones count?"
3,levity,"Apparently ""a music fan"" is allotted more than one review (if that's what it is) in which to grind some personal axe. And slow drummer? Hardly. In any case, the material on this CD is lots of fun and these guys are tight. I played it at the office and was swarmed thereafter with queries as to ""Who is that?"" ""Those guys are great!"" While it took a while to grow on me (except track #4 which was instant), it definitely did, and by leaps and bounds. On my colleagues it was far more instantaneous. And we're in our late 30's and early 40's, folks. So we've heard a lot in our time. It's been ages since I repeated a CD so many times. My only wish is for an improved recording of the material (from the technical standpoint rather than the performances - so that's really why it's 3 stars), but that could be my equipment petering out. I'd like to hear what a full album would sound like. In any case, read all these reviews and balance them out. Then make your own mind up."

1,Junk Junk Junk!!!,"At first listen this CD is difficult to get through soley based on the lead singers screechy voice. After listening to it another 7 times I wish I smashed the CD after the first listen. A waste of 2 hrs, even though that will only account for 0.0003% of my life. I think my money would be better spent on one of those CD's they sell at the counter at Denny's. Besides the singers less than decent voice, the beats almost put me into convulsions, the bad ones. The only way these musicians could have gotten a contract is if they're good looking girls."
3,"Good, but could be more","Moving Units is probably what would happen if The Rapture made it with The Strokes and their children, in an act of rebellion, moved to California and casually dated Hot Hot Heat.This 4 song EP gives you a pretty good idea about what Moving Units is about. Mostly, dancing your butt off. It's fun, but it feels like there's something missing. Probably more tracks and a fleshed out sound.Either way, it's good and I'd reccommend it to anyone who is tired of only hearing mall punk on the radio anymore."
5,An instant classic.,"I am currently enrolled in a public speaking course, and we can all take notes from Schwarzkopf's press briefing at the end of the Persian Gulf War. He spoke perfectly, withiout the use of note cards or teleprompters, and led the viewer through an immaculate presentation that showed, with the use of maps, US troop movements and strategy from the beginning to the end of the war. If you are any type of a war buff this will be a great addition to any collection; it is an instant classic."
5,Good toy,"I wasn't so sure about this pinata when I took it out of the package - it was my first experience with a toy of this type, and the colors were much darker than they appeared in the photograph. However, as soon as I walked into the room with it, my quiet & shy cockatiel spotted it and hurried over to check it out. He tore into it before I could even get it secured to the playstand! The other bird was skeptical at first, but now she enjoys playing with it too. It's fairly large and looks like it will be durable enough to last through lots of chewing. Good toy for the price."
2,Not as expected,I was surprised that this was an old library book. The pages were very yellow and it smelled musty.
2,Incident at Badamya,The book came quite quickly but I got a paperback book and I'm sure I ordered a hardback.
3,Incident at Badamya,"Ms. Gilman is always a great escape. It's easy to get lost in the story and feel as if you were really there. Not as good as her ""Mrs. Pollifax"" series but keeps you interested."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I agree with the last review. I wasn't expecting a miracle, but it didn't seem to do anything. Just invest in a nice iskin case and all is good."
2,"Mildly funny, but shockingly unfocused...","Whoopi Goldberg in her usual standup and movie routines is absolutely wonderful, so I was expecting big things from this audiobook. Perhaps my expectations were set a bit high.Instead of the string of jokes I'd been expecting, a full 2/3rds of the book was devoted to Whoopi expounding on her political viewpoints. Despite the fact I usually agreed with her political views, her soapbox-ranting style left me wanting a more eloquent spokesperson for her position. Much of the time, she simply comes off as a less thoughtful Dennis Miller.All of this would be bearable if she had some tiny shred of humility, but about the fourth time she assured me that she is, in fact, ""a funny person,"" I was ready to toss the tape out the window."
3,not for kids,Whoopi is normally hilarious. But the language in this book really turned me off. People who use language (swearing) like that sound like common street trash.
2,Meh,"There's not a whole lot about this album that hasn't been done a million times before and a million times better. The songwriting is just lackluster, 2-minute bursts of noise with no real direction or enthusiasm. The vocals are incredibly generic. Not to mention the album is only about as long as an EP, and two of the songs are basically instrumental filler. This band's really overhyped, and they fail to deliver on this album. If you want death metal done well, stick to things like Vader or Gorguts. Leave this garbage to the scene kids."
4,improvement into metal,"definately a good transition for them to try and lose the infamous 'death core' label. They lost the breakdowns for the most part that were lingering on DOOM. Each of the songs really keep their tempo and feel on this album. only problem is its 30 minutes long and has an interlude with only 10 tracks. But definately an improvement since doom. if you liked them before you will definately like them now. and if you didnt like them cuz of the breakdowns, give this a try"
1,Shut the lights and unplug the amps,"""... but there's nothing funny about JOB FOR A COWBOY's sound."" - REVOLVERThat's right, there's nothing funny about Job For a Cowboy's sound. There's also nothing good, pleasant, worthwhile, intriguing, exciting, fun or groundbreaking. Heck, it's not even passable as muscianship.I don't know how this band got on the Gingantour, or why they went on *AFTER* High on Fire, but there was no good reason for it. There is really no good reason for this band to exist. The amalgamation of noise I witnessed first hand on the Gigantour stop in Minneapolis had no sense of rhythm, melody, harmony or tempo, all key elements in any kind of music. If they don't make any money from future album sales they may be able to work for the Department of Defense developing some kind of less-lethal sound-based weapon."
1,not as good as the ep,"Their EP ""Doom"" is what got me hooked. JFAC had alot of good ideas packed into their demo. The music was so well executed that it blew current imitators away. I really enjoyed the song structures. I could care less about the pig squealing. Its kind of cheesy if you ask me but the screams and growls were better. Now they bring us ""Genesis"" which sounds more like a tiring attempt. There are no hooks and every song almost sounds the same. Its pretty bland. I've already lost hope in them and think that this band is going to get raped by the scene. I'd say, pick up the EP ""Doom"" which is much better than the ""Genesis"" LP."
1,I DESPISE Job For A Cowboy,"If I could give this less than a 1 star I would.This band claiming to be ""Death Metal"" is disgusting.Chuck Schuldiner would be turn over in his grave if he heard this garbage.Although, if you like JFAC you probably don't know who that is.I like true Death Metal such as Death,Obituary,Cannibal Corpse,Morbid Angel,Immolation,Suffocation,Deicide, etc.This album and band are a disgrace to everything Death Metal.DOWN WITH THESE PATHETIC POSERS!"
2,It's ok.,"I bought it for their hits. I would have to say that, for me, their hits haven't aged well.Also is stuff on here that I never heard."
3,?,"I wonder why people hate this band. I know they are not the best band out there though. This is the only album I heard from Job For A Cowboy. When I listen to the album I think Its a good album just not great. I listen to this band because while it can improve, for some reason I just think that there is a promise that they could get better once they figure out what sound they want and with more experience. I admit that there is better bands out there but If you want more Death Metal and have all the other great albums from other bands than you could check it out."
2,Boring,"When I first heard their EP Doom, I was hooked to the squealing, and barfing vocals. I couldn't wait untill Genesis came out. I was caught off guard with this one. Though I love Death Metal with a passion, they changed their vocals and style for that matter completely. Boring guitar riffs, hardly any pinch harmonics. No squealing, all just low boring guttural growls. This is definitely less talented than their Doom EP. They seem to scared to stray to far from just the Death Metal Genre. AKA They're genre death metal = boring, Their lyrics are pretty creative I must say, but they're still generic Death Metal lyrics, who bash Christianity. A much, much, better death metal alternative is Nile."
2,Get the 'Doom EP' instead....,"I have to say, before JFAC released this album, they were a great band. Each song sounded different, the breakdowns were awesome, and there was at least some structure to their songs.Now however, they have left behind their Deathcore roots and gone for a sound which is full on Death Metal. Is there anything wrong with it? Not really, it just sounds exactly the same as every other Death metal band out their trying to make it big.If you want decent Job For A Cowboy, listen to their EP Doom, and leave this one alone."
5,"aw, Jingle Cats","what's not to love (if you love cats) when kitties sing the songs? even if a dog gets into a song, too."
5,moths no more,"I have had no moths and no kitchen pests flying around either since I began using Prozap strips. Once upon a time I could get very small ones,perfect for small areas.Unfortunately ,these no longer seem to be made. I put one in my living room in an out of the way place and never have moths anymore. I also use them in a basement storage area and in the kitchen but must take care to have them some distance from food and pets.They are toxic so you must be careful."
2,INSTANT BUG FREE ZONE,UPDATEDEAD IN ONE WEEK. THERE GO MY STARS. STICK WITH HOT SHOT.INITIAL REPORTI was leery about trying any brand other than Hot Shot's Orig No Pest StripsHot Shot 5580 No Pest Strip Unscented Hanging Vapor Insect Repellentbut these shipped faster and I was desperate. The whopping chemical smell that hits ya as soon as you rip open the foil package let me know it was going to do the job. Not a thing with wings around me anywhere. Yes inside the home with A TON OF VENTILATION! Haven't had a summer without it since the 70s. The big initial scent dissipates immediately. Let me repeat though only apply this off-label usage if you can keep it many feet from anyone's face and with copious amounts of fresh air flowing through your dwelling.I have no pets so I can't attest to the safety of using this product if you do have pets in your home.
2,A reference book for research,This book is one of the reference books for Studying China's threat.The author's perspective based on the Cold War mentality and lack any theoretical innovation.The author does not know the contemporary China well.
3,Scary,"The book is good and may actually be true (the author's theories seem believable), but a little too much doom and gloom for me. I had to put it down and move on to happy thoughts."
5,less pain with the reverse formula,I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis. I noticed a significant decrease in pain after using the reverse formula for a couple weeks. I wish now I had paid more attention ten years ago to the books that suggest increased magnesium as a help for treating fibromyalgia.
2,Description is Misleading,"I like NOW Vitamins, unfortunately the description did not mention that it has Vitamin D in it. I have to take prescription D so can't take this."
4,Good info,"We need our polititions to read this, but they are about getting re elected, not about fixing anything. The contrast between how the economy should work and what this country is doing is why we are doomed."
2,"Worked great for about three months, then got progressively worse","We have had two sets of these (returned the first one after a few months). Each performed beautifully for about three months. We kept the monitors in the base for recharging the vast majority of the time. Slowly, each set began getting worse and worse reception until neither would make a connection unless you held it at a certain angle, in a certain direction, without anyone moving in the room! Too bad, because it really did work well initially."
2,works most of the time!,"Rip off for the price, everything interfers with them, they die very quickly we have been using them for 3months and they are not able to be removed from the charger for more than 10minutes than they beep!! sometime the frequency stops for no good reason, beeps until you change it! Wish I wouldnot have bought these!"
2,limited range,cannot make receivers work on a regular basis for more than about 50 feet from the main unit
1,Very difficult to adjust,"We had a first years monitor with our older son, and bought this when we had a second. I wish we had saved our money. Its major drawback are: very loud low volume setting, very bright monitor lights (like having a nightlight near the bed -- I have in fact used it for that purpose when getting up in the middle of the night), loses reception frequently, and if the power goes out (which seems to happen to us a lot), it shuts off and you have to go into the childs room to turn it back on (not the case with our other monitor). Most importantly, it is a failure as a two-room monitor. I found it such a hassle to program that we never used it as a two room monitor. I've used it for one son, and kept using the first year monitor I've had for years. buy something different."
2,frustrating,"One of the parent units simply did not work. Called Graco and spent so much time on the phone trying to set it up - still waiting for the fre replacement part they are supposed to send. Since I registered for it, could not return it to amazon within the timeframe between receiving it and trying it with the baby.....bummer."
4,Continues to work great after 2 years,"We've had this monitor for 2 years and have never had any issues. We've moved 3 times over that period, from suburbs to the city, 2 story and single story, and the monitor has worked well in every home. Right now it's placed in my son's room, which is upstairs on the back side of the house and we keep one receiver downstairs in the kitchen. If there is no noise coming from his room, you can't even tell it's on it's so quiet. Not sure if it really reaches 2000 ft, but we can take it across the street to the neighbors house and it still works. Our house is about 2700 sq. ft. so I think that's still a pretty good range. We can work in any part of the house, garage, out in the yard, etc. while he naps. Off the charger, it lasts about 3 hours - I don't really have a need for it to last longer than that."
1,Loved it until it broke!,"We bought this monitor because it is digital, which means no one else can pick up the signal and see and hear your baby. It worked great for a few months. One day the parent unit just quit working. I called Graco and they are going to give us a full refund. I am very disappointed because I love Graco products. I also love the idea of a digital video monitor. I guess I'm going to have to go in search of a new one from another manufacturer."
2,Not great.,"This was not the first monitor that I purchased, and also wasn't the last. The sound was ok, but definitely not loud enough. I want to know that my baby is awake before she is in a full blown hysterical scream. The range was no better than a Sony that I tried which was rated up to 900 feet. Unfortunately, there are a lot of walls between the nursery and our bedroom, so we aren't getting anything even close to the ratings. We have an old model from Philips that we bought for my now 5 year old son, and we are borrowing it for our new baby until I can find a new one that works as well. No luck so far. I'm going to try the new model Philips/Avent monitor. Hopefully, it's as good a product as our old one."
3,Great at first....,"We bought this monitor 14 months ago to use with our baby. It worked great with no interferance and provided great distance. I would estimate that in our apartment I could get about 100 ft from baby before I lost reception. My main complaints are (1)battery life since the units use a particular battery that is hard to find, the batteries became useless after about 6 months of HARD use (we used it as a baby IPOD) and (2)durability, after 14 months we are looking to buy a different brand for our new baby since this one is now not very reliable even when connected to the wall."
3,"OK, but doesn't last","We initially LOVED this monitor, but now, they don't seem to have the range they did at first. We constantly have to move it or adjust it in order to keep it functioning and not ""beeping"" at us. Very annoying. Not sure why the problem - they are 2 1/2 years old so may just have worn out, but I sure wish they worked as well as they did when we first bought them. I hate to have to throw them out!"
3,battery life issues,We have this monitor which is why I am searching for a new monitor. All in all it's not a bad monitor. It picks up our son's whimpers. It does have some static which does not bother us but for people who need quiet to sleep it may. Our issue is the battery life when the monitor is off the charger. There is no way the monitor can be off the charger for more than a couple of hours. We feel attached to an outlet when the baby is sleeping. Coincidentally we are probably going to go with another Graco model.
2,Range is minimal,"I bought this monitor for my second child, after moving to a new house with a very large yard. I wanted to be able to be outside with my 3 year old and still hear the baby. The range is virtually non-existent. No where near 2000 feet. If you bought this monitor for that reason - return it. Otherwise, it works well."
1,Can't find link!,"This monitor worked ok at the beginning but after 1 month of use, the monitor keeps beeping saying the ""link"" has been dropped. we have tried changing the ""channel"" over and over and it still beeps trying to find a link. its very frustrating. we are going to try the sony model as our neighbors swear by it."
2,"Snap, CRACKLE & Pop","When they were new 2 & 1/2 years ago they worked great with no issues noted. Eventually they started to develop this crackling sound which annoys the heck out of my wife and I. I have no idea why it does this. There is no interference that I can tell of.As for battery life, as others have said, over time the battery life has shortened. Go figure, we haven't used them off the charger extensively, which is weird.All said, if I was given the chance to purchase them again I would definitely steer clear. If you decide to purchase them, think about getting a warranty so you can exchange them with no problems down the road."
2,Great when it stays connected but....,"Like several others have said- this was a great monitor with all the features we needed & it worked very well for several months after we bought it. However, it suddenly began to pop and click once in a while and other times it will disconnect for a few seconds and then reconnect *but not always.The size, weight, portablility and the recharging bases as well as the fact it can be turned down to hear no static - nothing but if the baby makes noises- are everything we wanted but my husband finally said tonight, ""go find a better monitor before I throw this one out the window!""We have a tri-level, two cordless phones, wireless internet & live 30 feet from our neighbors. Our old FP Lights and Sounds worked well but was worn out after 12 years!Guess we are back to searching for a monitor that works in our house!"
5,no interference from neighbors OR 900 Mhz,"No probs with this picking up neighbors or interfering with our existing FP 900 Mhz monitor for our 2 1/2 year old. We had to trash a Safety First cheaper one and invest in this, but it's worth it and we really like it. It's clear, and we also like that it comes with two receivers. Much easier, even in our smaller home."
1,Distance is not true!,"We purchased this monitor because it claims to work even if you have wireless internet and for the distance claims. Unfortunately we found interference after less than 100 feet. Our baby's bedroom is downstairs in the back of our house and we get massive static in the downstairs front room of our 1900 sq. ft. 2 story house! So don't believe the distance claims. Also, our rechargeable batteries are now dead and will not hold a charge. Our baby is only 13 months old and the batteries have been dead for 6 months."
2,Worked great AT FIRST...,"We bought this for our first-born last February. It worked great at first, although the distance that it could ""travel"" never impressed us. After less than a year of using this, the cord that plugs into the base started not staying plugged in, it would fall out constantly. So multiple times a night we would have to go in to our sons room and re-adjust the machine in order to get the cord to stay plugged in. Would not recommend this monitor... especially for how expensive it is."
2,I wouldn't recommend it for the price,"I bought this monitor about a year ago. When I first got it, I was very happy with it. There was very little static and I could hear the baby crying pretty clearly. But after about 6 months of use, it started going downhill. Now, I want nothing more than to throw it out the window every time I have to turn it on. Even if the monitor's been charging all night, the second you turn it on it starts crackling. My house isn't very big, but if I go more than 1 room away, the signal dies, the light goes red, and it starts beeping at me.I give it 2 stars because for the first 6 months, it worked pretty well.If you only need a monitor for a few months and have money to spare, by all means knock yourself out. But if you're looking for a long-term monitor that you can use for over 6 months or (shock!) reuse with another child, find a better brand. Better to spend a little more instead of having to buy something twice."
2,Worked well until used for 11 months,"We used this monitor nearly every day since we had our son 11 months ago. It had great range and no interference. However, the last few weeks, the battery began to die earlier and earlier (It usually lasted a couple of hours before needing charged.) Now, it sits on it's charging base and still will not charge, rendering it useless. I gave this two stars because, for the price that we paid, it was not worth the money - even though it has lasted us 11 months."
2,i hated this monitor!,"registered for this, and it was great for the first couple of months that i used it. the range was good and the sound quality was excellent.however, by the time my daughter was 1, i had gotten rid of it. it just go worse and worse as time went on. there was a crackling sound that had to with the monitor plug that would wake me up multiple times a night, it was almost always 'out of range' (even from just 1 room away), and the vibe thing wasn't all it was cracked up to be (for me anyway). an absolute waste of money, especially since it was NOT cheap! i had hoped to be albe to use it for several years, but it didn't even make it through one. would loved to have been able to return it, but it'd been too long. i'm looking for another monitor."
3,"Good at first, doesn't last","We bought this monitor about a year and a half ago. We had tried two other models previous to this one and I was always annoyed at night by the static they caused. At first this monitor was great. Very little static at night -- but, there was still some static. But, over the time we have had it, it has gradually started to deteriorate. It began about 8 months ago to lose the signal easily and beeping at all hours in the middle of the night waking us up. Then it began to lose its range easily. Finally, last night it stopped working completely. Unfortunately, I didn't realize it had stopped working b/c it no longer will beep when it loses the signal. It seems that this product should last longer for the price paid (which a year and a half ago was over $100). OH, and never drop the receivers. They are very sensitive and one drop could be the end of your monitor. The belt clip is not designed very well, so it is difficult to hook onto your pants and keep in one place."
2,Does Not Withstandt the Test of Time,"Was good for the first few months and then started losing battery power. Then at about a year, stopped working completely. With a new baby coming we are having to buy a brand new monitor. We will probably be forking out a little extra money this time."
2,"Good sound, bad range and battery life","Because we live in a town house in the city, I thought a digital review would be the way to go. It works fine in our 1,200 SF home, with no interference. However, the monitor has two major drawbacks. First, the battery life does not last 8 hours, which is a problem if the monitor is off the base, you're sleeping, and it starts to beep LOUDLY. The second major problem is that the monitor has terrible range. Visiting family in their larger country homes, the monitor would lose its signal with the base if there were more than a couple of walls that it had to travel through. I am now shopping for a new monitor that will give us the range that we need."
1,Terrible! Buy Something Else!,"This is the 2nd set of monitors we had because our original Fisher Price Lights n Sounds died after about 18 months. We thought we'd try something new so we bought these. I really regret it. They never keep a charge, they never pick up the sounds from my 2 year olds room and they are always staticy and beeping!. I'm just grateful I bought these for an older child instead of an infant, because I would have never heard a baby on these things- they are constantly turning themselves off. We are expecting our 2nd baby and are on our 3rd monitor system, having bought the Fisher Price Private Connection monitors a month ago. I would hightly recommend them, they even have a battery back up!"
1,"BEEP, BEEP, BEEP",I was so excited about this monitor and it has been a disappointment - I can't figure out if it is the range or the battery but it beeps all the time. I am going to call today to see how amazon can help to get us either a replacement or a different monitor. Very disappointed so far based on the cost - but hopefully amazon will offer resolution - TBD
2,Bad battery or bad monitor?,"Never holds a charge, even when plugged in. If it would run on AC power, I wouldn't even care, but it only uses the AC power to charge the battery off of which it operates. Look at the other monitors before you choose this one. I'm throwing mine away and getting the Uniden phone system which come with a room/baby monitor feature instead."
2,"Disappointed, especially after buying a competitor","We've had the monitor for over a year and a half and it's been disappointing. The range advertised is 2000 ft, yet it doesn't make it to the other end of our house (it's not a big house). The batteries are terrible, and after a few months we resorted to leaving it plugged in all the time. Not great when we need to wander the house, but then again, it doesn't reach all of the house anyway.We recently took a trip and purchased a different monitor to take with us-the Safety First Hi Def Digital Monitor. That one works better than advertised and made the Graco pale in comparison.We do still use the Graco occasionally, but much prefer the Safety First."
4,Great product! Works as advertised. Reception almost perfect.,"This product works wonderfully, especially for its price point. Having two monitors is a real convenience; equally convenient is the monitors being wireless and rechargeable.Reception is generally excellent, but very occasionally the units can lose contact with the base, which results in an annoying loud beeping (which in itself is good b/c you know they aren't receiving signal). We have no problem with over-loudness reported by earlier reviewer (which almost caused me not to buy it--glad we didn't)."
1,I think I must have gotten a lemon,"I think this is the worst monitor in the history of monitors. I wake up several times every night because it starts beep, beep, beeping.... because it has lost it's signal. If I type at my computer ( I guess because I am in the way of the monitor or something), it goes off again, losing its signal. It drives me nuts! It works about 70% of the time, and I have been hesitant to go and buy another one because consumer reports says this is as good as it gets... so I don't want to go and spend even more money on a monitor that works even less than the one I already have. I give this product two HUGE thumbs down."
1,Terrible beeping!!!!!,"This is such a terrible product. I bought because of the GRACO brand and was very dissapointed. The range is not good, lots of static and although my baby sleeps at night we cannot because of the constant beeping, it seems it looses signal or something and it wakes us up. The batteries did not last very long of the base unit and now they will not resist more than 30' off the base. BUY SOMETHING ELSE, WE WILL!!"
2,Some serious flaws,"The sound quality is very good. That being said we have 2 problems. 1) it seems the parent units have to have almost a direct line of sight with minimal walls and doors between to get good signal. 2) if power is lost in the home the child unit does not turn back on automatically so both parent units will be beeping because they can't find the base. HUGE problem at 3am. For a tiny infant you can sneak in and turn the base back on, but as my son got older this was not practical. Very disappointing. We ended up just getting rid of the monitor. I could not even bring myself to sell it because the problems with loss of power were so bad I did not want to put another parent though that."
3,Love/Hate Relationship with Monitor,"We have had this monitor for over a year and until about 2m's ago I LOVED it. Great range, got about 6hrs of life out of the parent units even though they are almost always on their bases and no static or reception issue. And for those who say there are no warnings when the batteries die, mine beep so I can agree there. Then the beeping started, all night long it beeps and stops then beeps and stops. Now we have static and the beeping so I just feel frustrated we are going to need a new one our twins are only 17m old and now in big boy beds so its essential, but I hate to buy this again an donly get a year out of it. I just wish I had a guarantee."
1,"A waste of money, don't bother","We bought this monitor and are only able to use it inside of our house, it looses the signal once we step outside of the house to get the mail or work in the yard. We live in a new residential area with no known interferences. Our cheaper monitors work better and have better range. We purchased this monitor for the range and quality purposes and it is basically useless and we are out of our 30 day return policy so we are now stuck with it. We DO NOT recommend this monitor at all."
2,"Horrible range, annoying beeps",I will chime in with those commenting on the annoying beeps. It definately does not have the range it claims to have. It loses connection to the base all night long and beeps when it does. You have to set it just so to keep it from beeping. And we cannot keep it next to the bed because of the static. I hate this thing. Don't buy it.
2,very disappointed,At first this monitor seemed great. But the battery died after about a year and no one sells replacement batteries. Graco advertises the battery as being rechargable but it really isn't. I cant even use the monitor on its base. The monitor is completely useless.
5,Great monitor,"We really love this monitor. Especially since it has two parent units, we too leave one upstairs in our room for at night and one downstairs for her naps during the day. We have not had any problems with static and we do have satellite TV, wireless internet, several cordless phones, etc. The sound is very clear, however, as other reviewer have pointed out, the lowest setting is still pretty loud, but it is always clear. We rarely use the parent units off of their charging base as they are easy heard without having to be right next to you. The few times we have used them off of the base the battery lasted about 3-4 hours. Overall we are very happy with this product."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"We bought this at the suggestion of a friend, and we liked it from the beginning. It is very easy to use, and it picked up every sound from the nursery. After a few days of use, this proved to be more of a bad thing than good. Every time our baby even rolls over in the crib, we can hear the rustling of the sheets. And even at the lowest volume setting, the bright lights flash and wake us up.After 8 months, both parent units are crackling with interference on a constant basis. And they both lose their signal from the transmitter and start beeping incessantly even when they are only one room away.We are looking to buy a new monitor now. This one is now unacceptable."
3,coconut lover's cookbook,"I was looking for recipes using coconut flour. So I was disappointed that all the bakegoods used mostly whole wheat flour. There was not even one recipe using the coconut flour. I bought this book instead of the ""cooking with coconut flour"" because I thought it would have a mixture of recipes. The other recipes looked very good and I am looking forward to trying them."
4,Coconut Lover's Cookbook,This book offers lots of tasty receipes of which I have tired a few with very good results. Who knew there were so many ways to incorporate coconut into one's daily diet. Also there are tips offered in each chapter which I found to be appropriate and helpful. This is a cookbook that I plan on keeping.
3,No Pictures,OK some good recipes but gets tiring at try to read. Book could be bigger wirh larger typing and with pictures
2,Not Yummy!,Every recipe I tried in this book was either barely edible or went in the garbage. Unless you are really committed to eating this way.....don't waste your money!
4,Persuader & Freternia,"4 early tracks from both bands, 2 each from their first albums and 2 demo tracks each. On this one, the Freternia tracks are a bit stronger than the Persuader ones, but both bands are great. Excellent examples of young Scandanavian power metal. I bought mine when it was first released, but they're getting hard to find now."
3,Return to Sleepaway Camp(2008),"Return to Sleepaway Camp(2008) takes place after Sleepaway Camp(1983) and ignores the sequels produced by Double Helix Films.I thought this horror comedy was a fun guilty pleasure. Critics and Sleepaway Camp fans consider this film the worst installment in the series. Kids and camp counselors at Camp Manabe are getting butchered. People suspect that a fat kid named Alan is doing the killing. This film delivers gory death scenes and lots of foul language! The film stars Vincent Pastore, Isaac Hayes, Johnathan Tierston and Felissa Rose. This film is packed with pretty girls with large breasts! This movie was shot in 2003, but it was shelved for five years. It was released straight to DVD in 2008. Return to Sleepaway Camp is no classic, but it's still watchable."
3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"It takes a good actor to play a bad one, and that's really the point of Return To Sleepaway Camp. Many critics have given this movie a terrible review, because they just don't understand it. Back in the 50's and 60's B-Movies were terrible because they had a very small budget. The actors were bad, the effects were ridiculous, and the story was rushed. Today's B-Movies have 100 times the budget of their predecessors. Return To Sleepaway has bad acting and terrible effects, not because they had no budget, but rather to pay homage to the B-Movies of the past. If you look at it in that context, this movie is actually pretty good! The kids are great, there are some really funny lines, and the cheesy effects are hilarious. It's just a simple, funny, old fashion B-Horror movie, that I enjoyed quite a bit."
1,WHAT THE ****,WHY ARE THERE ANY GOOD REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE!?I rented this movie from Redbox and in the case was a little note saying 'congratulations on renting the worst movie in the world'oh my god were they right.
1,Disappointed,This movie is abosolutely terrible and I really liked the first 3. The acting is terrible and the plot is transparent. Most of the kills are men being sliced and diced. There is zero nudity and really no attractive women in the whole thing. Do not buy this movie. It was not worth waiting 25 years for this crap. I am totally disappointed and wish Amazon would give a refund to whoever orders this. Believe me you will feel like you deserve one.
2,Keepaway Camp,"I own the Sleepaway trilogy and love the first film more than the two follow-ups.This entry in the series is a bit of a letdown, even considering the novelty of using some of the original actors from the first installment. Everything about this `sequel' is obnoxious. It's loud; the characters/actors are all abrasive (there's no balance in that regard, what are the odds of everyone being thoroughly repellant?). The pacing is slow. The ""villain"" of this piece is obvious from the outset so trying to hide the identity was a wasted effort. The ""kills"" were few and far between and what passed as filler in the meantime were endless scenes of cruelty/bullying (meant to be funny?).The original concept worked, this trip down memory lane didn't. It's even more apparent when you watch all the films in one sitting. Not a keeper, not worth seeing again."
2,Disappointed...,"I own the first three installments of the film genre, with the first movie being the best, the other two not as good. Return to Sleepaway Camp disappoints in regards to the quality of acting, plot and a very poorly conceived finale with a very brief cameo appearance by the killer, Angela. To put it bluntly, the writers made a very low budget film and it showed considerably. Though some of the original cast from the first movie was brought back in, it wasn't enough to bring great reviews to the actors reading from a terrible script."
2,Prepare for disappointment,"I found the original movies this was based on campy, funny, shocking, and Exploitative. Unfortunately, Return to summer camp contains none of these elements. OK.. maybe campy.. but not in the spirit of the originals. my message to the producers... become more familiar with you genre. This was a watchable movie, but hardly holds a candle to the originals. If you are going to remake an 80's horror exploitation film... then do that! Don't nerf a cult classic."
1,Why God why!?!?!?!,"First off, let me say that I love a good cheesy horror movie. But this movie is a complete waste of time. First, Issac Hayes is only in the movie for about 2 minutes. Complete let down in that regard. Secondly, the ""Alan"" character is so over the top and annoying that you begin to cheer for the bullies and hope that he dies soon. And when he doesn't the auidence is left very unfullfilled. The other problem with this movie is that there is absoliutely no nudity in it. It is a horror movie that takes place at a camp and no one gets naked, I want my money back."
2,I want my money back,"Contains spoilers.OK, I knew I should have rented this movie before I bought it. It was a waste of $20.00. I had high hopes because I loved the original movie and the two sequels. I knew this would be a direct sequel to the original, so I knew to ignore 2 and 3. I was excited to see the original Angela, nothing against Pamela Springsteen, but I couldn't wait to see Felissa reprise her role. This is what I was most disappointed about. We only get to see her, without her ""diguise"", for the last minute of the movie! I feel ripped off!This movie revolved way too much around Alan. Kids are cruel, this is true, but he practically begged for it. I felt no simpathy for him, he was a bully himself.The only reason I give this movie two stars is because we get to see some of the original cast members, and my oh my, Ricky sure got hot!I would recommend this movie for a rental only, don't waste your money to buy it."
2,"Some good death scenes, but stupid dialogue","There is nothing like the original, and this movie doesn't nearly live up to it. Only worth buying to see the death scenes. (My favorite is when the killer makes a guy drink gasoline, puts a lit cigarette in his mouth, and he explodes.)The acting an dialogue is pretty bad even for a B-movie. I didn't dig it. The kid getting bullied goes and picks fights with people. When they start picking back at him, he starts whining that no one likes him.Several actors from the original movie appear in this one in adult roles (SPOILER!!!!!!!! - including Angela, who is actually the killer, not the kid getting picked on)."
3,Not very satisfied,I purchase this movie only for the fact it completes my Sleepaway Camp set. I was so disappointed with the movie that I actually went forward to the end just to see who the killer was. I figured that this movie would be a repeat of the prior 3. BOY WAS I WRONG! It completely reverses the order of the movies and I think that in the final chapter the writers and directors would have at least started where #3 let off.
2,This was a little disappointing after waiting so long,"I really don't exect a real lot from horror movies anymore after seeing some real dooseys this wasn't as bad as some of the movies I have seen where you sit there and think to yourself I can't believe I am wasting my time watching this or I can't believe someone actually made this crap, but you certainly won't be saying this is the best movie ever!The characters are annoying and almost over the top in unbelievability, the acting was strange, and the story (was there one) was very transparent. This movie was made entirely for the fans of the first one, if you loved the first one, this will satisfy some kind of need in you. But if you thought it was just ok you will be disappointed, you may even be disappointed if you are a fan like I was."
1,WORST MOVIE,"I went to the redbox the other day to rent return to sleepaway camp and I really thought it might be good,but I was Dead wrong this was the worst horror movie ever. The acting was terrible the killings were a joke and everything about the movie was bad esp the kid Alan. Where did they find these actors. Ok issac hayes I felt bad his name was in the movie credits. The sleepaway camp series was legendary,but this was trash. A total waste of MONEY AND TIME. They should take this movie out of video stores target,best buy etc. I've seen people at film schools make better films then this was. For those reading this PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
2,overrated,"I forgot west coast rappers like to sing parties under the sun while east coast keeps it real. West coast. They are barely better then the dirty south. I thought when they said ""freestyle"" i would hear a flow not singing. What the hell. For now on i will stick with the east. West coast sucks. They sing to much. I expected more rapping."
4,For the Hockey Junky,"We are a hockey family - live and die by it - and have been without it for a year. This is an excellent hockey special discussing the history of Lord Stanley's cup. It is basically an ESPN special I think, so you are getting a TV show on a DVD. But if you have wondered what the deal is with the cup, where it comes from, how do they fit on the names on it, why they hold it over their heads, and who is the guy in the commercial with the white gloves who is carrying it around -- it's a good show."
1,Boooring!,"Have you ever watched mud dry? Well I can guarantee that it might be more entertaining than this film. A great idea lost by poor production quality, no story telling ability and strange production choices.Good for the hockey fan who wants to catch some highlights. Otherwise, good luck staying awake!"
5,vet solutions ear cleansing solution,Have used this product for years. It really helps my dogs ears stay clean and healthy.
4,Less than at the vet,Great product I would buy this exact one from my vet for a lot more. It makes my 3 year old cocker spaniel's ears smell good and it reduces ear infections and ear scratching ... Great product
4,Well worth finding,"This 1993 album from Van Morrison is a great mix of Blues, Jazz and R&B; influences. The man himself is in great vocal form throughout the album.There are a few weak tracks, noteably the duet with John Lee Hooker on Gloria which just doesn't work. I love JLH but his singing on this just seems completely out of place. So it would have been better with 2 or 3 songs less. However that aside its a fine collection of songs with Van Morrison demonstrating his musicianship (Guitar, Alto Sax and Harmonica), song-writing, and his ability to put his own stamp on other peoples songs as well.The supporting band includes Georgie Fame on Hammond Organ and backing vocals. Hopefully this will get another release in due course, but in the meantime if you like Van the Man this is well worth hunting out."
5,Superb Van Morrison,Van Morrison has been on the music scene for nearly 50 years. This CD is just one more example of his greatness. This is a wonderful collection of his work.
3,Last CD for Island records,"Reading alot of the reviews for this CD, the general opinion is that this is Ronny's best work. I liked this CD, fav cuts being Deep in your Heart: Homage, and my Favourite cut Light to Dark.I don't think this is his best work, as I feel that Off the Record holds that accolade."
5,The Geeta,"The first time I even heard of Ronny Jordan was when his name popped up on [...]. I played the song, then I ""fell in love"" with Ron. I not only like his guitar playing, but his instrumental accompanyment is outstanding to me. I love the background keyboards, the funky grooves of his songs, and the background vocals too. He almost has a ""Hip-Hoppish"", ""R and B-ish"" tone to some of his songs, and I dig that. I've already ordered 2 of his CD""S ..... Much props to you Ron."
3,Ronny Jordan.... Light to Dark,"Having been spoiled by Jordan's previous works, it is hard to accept anything less, but still a good cd."
2,Look further for authentic Eastern wisdom,"Trupp must certainly have enjoyed the creative outlet of this project, and he has obviously worked hard to attempt the calligraphy. The whole project, however, is at the same heavy-handed and slim on substance. Readers will benefit more from indulging in their own creative journeys than from tagging along on this one."
5,The Raphael Conspiracy,"***** 5 StarsRiveting story of suspense, danger and action.Takes us inside cutthroat world of international commerce in art treasures where theft,smuggling, forgeries, deception and greed thrive among shady dealers and ruthless collectorsNew detective is smart, funny, sexy. And even more ruthless. Scene moves from red brick andcobblestone of Boston to the wild coast of Maine."
3,DVDs featuring Bing Crosby,"I grew up with the Crosby musicals/music, as well as Sinatra, etc. I still enjoy sitting back and being entertained rather lectured or preached to. Many of today's movies lack the entertainment feature. These were two very enjoyable, singable, and family-type movies."
2,Poor acting; too many silly supporting characters.,"I am a huge fan of Bing Crosby and have enjoyed all of his movies until this one. The main problem is that all the actors seem to be over-acting and the result is entirely unbelievable. The music is annoying, especially the oft-repeated, ""Cool, cool, cool of the evening."" The only word that describes this film for me is, ""SILLY."""
3,Bing at a bargain,"There are no special features here, and the ""Groom"" film is in black and white, but for Bing Crosby or old-fashioned musical fans, you can't go wrong with this at a bargain price. The ""Groom"" film features the Oscar-winning song ""In the Cool Cool of the Evening"" (fun lyrics by Johnny Mercer) and it's a treat. Who knew Jane Wyman could sing!? The movie plot is sappy and entirely predictable, but as in many of his roles, Bing adds just a touch of jazzy hip flourishes."
5,Love the movie!,My 9 year old daughter and I absolutely love this movie. It is clean and fun. Highly recommended!
5,I love one of the movies!,"I bought this for Here Comes the Groom which stars Jane Wyman and Bing. I love this movie. Bing is a guy with commitment issues and Jane is his girlfriend who wants a commitment NOW. She's waited several years and she's ready for wedding bells. Just about the time that Bing comes home with two orphans, ready for commitment, she has broken up with him and found someone else. It's a fun musical and the kids are adorable."
1,Review of Material,I had to buy this book for a senior social welfare class and so far I am unimpressed with this book. If you are looking for a review of material this is the right book for you. However if you are interested in teaching older students than I would keep looking at other texts. I have had another text book from the same author and I was displeased with the last text as well. I would not recommend this test nor the other.
4,Correction for URL given in Prior review,The correct URL for the UW Photo tips is:http://www.seapix.com/tips.htmSorry for any confusion I may have caused.eyesguy@aol.com
4,scary!,"i love diamanda, have seen her perform live three times, & have met her in person. i can never get enough. a uniquely disturbing record, (in the best way, of course), it sends shivers down my spine."
1,Not meant as an introductory text,"If I had to use one word to describe this book, I would call it ""garbage"". To be fair, I had no background in PDEs (other than an introductory course to ODE's as an undergraduate) so I expected a challenge when stepping into a graduate level PDE course. Yet, parts of the book seem to be unnecessarily sparse, difficult and dry. The reader is assumed to have a very strong background in PDEs to begin with, and be familiar with topics such as the Gauss-Divergence theorem, ""standard mollifiers"", and other esoteric concepts I had never even heard of before picking up the book. Proofs are presented in a compact, impossible to understand manner. Even the motivation for some of the concepts is unclear.This is without a doubt the worst math text I have ever had the displeasure of coming across."
3,Perfect for military brats,A 90 proof mix of Sarah Bird's memory and imagination. Some LOL moments (Bird does phonetic Japanese as no other). Caution: the morning after can be a little rough on fellow military brats.
5,Another great novel from Sarah Bird,"Years ago I became a fan of the author when I read The Boyfriend School. Since then I have read and enjoyed all her books. This one is more serious, but once again is an amazing creation of a time and place. Little details in the book made it almost real for me even though I am not a member of a military family and have never been to Japan. Keep on writting, Sarah!"
3,"Same old, same old","I gave this novel/memoir 3 stars out of sympathy and appreciation of the only interesting segment of the book, the Japanese maid's story. Perhaps, unlike many of the other readers, because I was not a military brat, I lacked empathy with the characters. Whatever the reason, halfway through, I became very tired with the Root family children and their pedestrian problems (Mom loved you best? Come on - it's 2003! Write something new.). This is very old ground and the subject of way too many American novels of the last 20 years."
5,A GREAT READ!,"I love this book. Bernie Root is terrific. This is the best military brat novel since THE GREAT SANTINI. My favorite part was Fukimo's story. If you have to read a book this summer, read Sarah Bird's."
2,"Selling Well, but Oh Well","If you like TV (and in fact I do, when it's on TV), you'll love this book. Because it's television on the page. The writing is full of witty humor and touching sensitivity, haha and aahh. I have friends in Austin, where I guess Sarah Bird is so beloved , so I'd pioked the book up. Oh well. I prefer fiction that entertains in the lit way, not as a movie idea for TNT. Even though I was disappointed, I understand how many people like these kind of books."
3,Pomme Fritz,"WIERD, WEIRD, WEIRD. THAT ONE WORD COULD BE APTLY USED TO DESCRIBE THIS ALBUM AS A WHOLE AS ALEX AND FRIENDS PRODUCE PROBABLY THEIR MOST EXPERIMENTAL ALBUMS TO DATE. I MUST STRESS HOWEVER THAT THIS IS NOT A BAD ALBUM AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYBODY INTO THIS SORT OF MUSIC TO GO OUT AND BUY. I DO FIND HOWEVER THAT I DO NOT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM AS OFTEN AS I USED TO, PERHAPS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT ACTUALLY BECOMES QUITE SCARY IN PLACES IN THAT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT GOING TO HIT YOU NEXT.THERE ARE 2 EXCELLENT TRACKS ON THE ALBUM IN THE SHAPE OF THE FIRST TRACK, POMME FRITZ AND ALLES IST SCHOEN WHICH TAKE YOU ON A TRIP INTO DEEP SPACE. HIS IMORTAL LOGNESS (APARENTLY ABOUT A FRIEND OF THEIRS WHO USED TO CONTINUOUSLY HOG SPLIFFS FROM OTHERS) LIVES UP TO THE FIRST THREE WORDS AS MENTIONED AT THE TOP OF THIS REVIEW."
3,"uhh, TOO experimental...","I have to say, I love every single Orb album (yes, even the new ones so many people complain about)... except this one. A little too avant-garde, this one... Every other Orb CD of mine gets a regular spin, except this... too much noise, hard to listen to. I can't quite figure out how you could drive to this one, as that reviewer mentioned a few reviews back.. I think I'd be tempted to crash into something if I listened to it in the car.If you prefer some melody/rhythm in the music, don't bother with this one.. for lovers of extreme avant-garde/experimental or Orb completists only."
1,What is the french word for 'crap'?,Nonsense and a complete waste of time. Obviously released to fulfill a contractural obligation.
3,Headphones a MUST,"One of two times I had a cup of special tea made from mushrooms from BC, I rushed home and threw my headphones on. I played this CD repeatedly. It was the only time this cd clicked with me. I figured if I wasn't flying I should bother listening, I haven't played it since. (Maybe I'm a little scared to.) That was 1996 and my life hasn't suffered from it's absence."
2,A bell is a cup until it is struck,"Just as ""Orbus terrarum"", this EP release is rubbish next to ""U.F.Orb"". Co-written and produced by German club-heads Sun Electric, I really expected a more electrifying and interesting album. O.k., the title track is a funny tune with lazy melodies and chirping samples. The perfect soundtrack for floating in shallow, warm water. Besides, this CD is even more unfocused and less memorable than ""Orbus terrarum"". ""We're pastie.."", based on looped vocal samples, is very childish. ""Alles ist schoen"" (German phrase for ""Eevrything is beautiful"") is a bit better, coming up with some ambient sounds typical for the Orb's earlier output. But for the most part, this album is very lame and almost unlistenable. However, I recommend you to check out Sun Electric's albums, particularly ""Kitchen"" and ""Via Nostra""."
3,Soundscapes for the brave only,"If you're into the pre-success Kraftwerk, but with even more minimal leanings (think Eno or Glass), or some of the beat-less tracks of Skinny Puppy, you might find something on this record to make it worth your while. This is a record for people who are already electronic music connoisseurs, and I don't mean people who happen to find they like house or drum-n-bass. This is a hardcore soundscape set, like a keyboard version of Kid Koala's funny noise record ""Carpal Tunnel Syndrome"", and don't be surprised if you don't like it. It's an acquired taste, and not the most solid offering in this respect, but fine for existing fans."
5,A freaky fav,"This is a trippy, drippy morph of bips, blips, beeps, sweeps, synths, samples, drops, ambiance, creeps, creeks, meeps, mopes and so on, and on, and on, and on. You can be completely sober and this album will transport you to pluto and back. Stopping off at every convenience store open along the way"
1,extremely disappointing,"As someone who benefitted from his first Total Immersion video, I was extremely disappointed with this one. It should have been entitled ""Better Fly for Old Geezers"" as the guy can't even DO the butterfly with any kind of form due to his (admitted) inflexibility. I'm close to his age but still want to learn the real stroke. He has a younger,more limber swimmer in the video, but that guy has virtually no time on the screen. Save your money and look at the JimmyDShea videos on YouTube - he rocks!"
3,helpful tip,"IF you want to do it the cheap skate way, take a hack saw with a fine tooth blade and cut the steel nipple off just after it reduces from the large od to the small od. then take a pair of needle nose pliers and hold the remaining nipple with a little bit of tension. Now take a small screw driver and press back each of the 4 spring tabs to release. It will take all of 5 minutes at most to do it this way.If you have one of the blade holders for a hacksaw blade that makes the blade into a knife handle type it will work the best. I can see no reason to buy the Lisle 35000 unless you change a lot of these filters or are just a tool junky.:)"
4,"Good product, but could not get filter off","This is the first tool that I have been able to get to ""semi-work"" on my 03 Chevy Suburban flex fuel filter. This one at least fit and did as it was supposed to, but I still could not get the filter to come loose. Going to have to give this one to a mechanic with a lift to work on. Incredibly poor design by Chevy on the flex fuel option. As for the tool, it is the best one I have found so far to work on this problem. The ones from the neighborhood chain parts stores are a waste of money for this vehicle."
5,Hard to find.,My husband only likes to use plastic toothpicks and they are very hard to find. Now he has plenty and is thrilled. Got a ton of them for a good price. They came in on time and in new condition. Very pleased.
1,Filled with complaints...Why not just go to Slashdot?,"I bought this book thinking I'd get more familiar with Vista, since some of my clients may have it. Instead, I find the guy proselytizing about ""software as a service,"" DRM, anti-competitive behavior, bloat, and everything else you can hate Microsoft for. While many of his criticisms are valid from my perspective, they have nothing to do with a reference or introduction to Vista, and I was very disappointed."
4,Vista for Dummies,There are many pieces of information that one would never know without a handbook like this. It is easy to find specific information and just assumes I don't know anything at all (which is true in some cases).
4,Loser Vista good book,This Dummies is overall well written but the software is such a loser that even old Bill can't justify it. Microsoft has lost it's edge but this does explain it well.
2,WINDOWS VISTA,"Windows Vista For DummiesI have read alot of these books and find this one actually more complicated than the rest. Vista is fairly new anyway!. I bought the TEACH YOURSELF VISUALLY / MICROSOFT WINDOWS VISTA after this book and found it to be a much better learning tool than this one. I prefer visuals anyway and will probably not buy anymore dummy books without visuals. I think most of them are text anyway, so unless they change some of the future content to visual, they can keep the rest. I wish I had saved my money on this one."
4,Great book,"This is a great book for people who do not understand vista and it's complicated GUI. This was great i got it for my grandparents and now they are asking me about things i have no idea about, and I'm a CIS major. Great book really suggest it"
5,Windoms Vista For Dummies,The book help you get out of troble that you are in. If you are trying to change somethings you look it up in the book
4,great,"Well written, useful and helpful, makes you think about translation process and makes you focus on issues related to translation so that when you translate you are really aware of what you are doing."
5,Great entertainment for the lay person,Couldn't put it down. Liked the logical progression and the variety of information. I didn't know how scattered the bits of continents are! Fascinating.
2,removes scratches but at a heafty price,"i bought this product for my U2 ipod, which seems to be very easy to scratch. you get three cleaners with it, a maintenence polish, a scatch remover, and a metal polish/deep scratch remover. the metal polish/deep scratch remover is the only of the three that actually does anything. it does nothing for the metal and it will probably look worse when youre done. as for the plastic, it did remove some of the scratches, but some of it got stuck inbetween the click wheel and the frame. now the click wheel works about 40% as well as it did before, and thats after i cleared out what polish i could. my advice is to just buy a case when you first get your ipod and avoid scratches all together, and if you have scratches, just live with them."
1,Why won't Amazon let me use negative stars?,"If they would, I'd give this one a -3 stars. If you are reading this, then you already know this book can be purchased used for $0.01 In my opinion, it is an outrageous price. Should be at least 50% less. So why am I even doing this? I need to offset the first review which is obviously intended for another product altogether. Aside from the extremely loose interpretation of the laws of physics, there was not one character who had any redeeming qualities. The book would have been much better had everyone in the plane died, and the flaming wreckage fallen directly on the building housing the other main characters, thus putting themselves out of their collective misery."
1,Pathetic,"This book is a horrible and false indictment of the funeral industry, and slap in the face to the thousands of honest caring funeral directors everywhere who work in dirty, dangerous conditions for low pay and benefits to provide a service that no one else wants to do."
1,Revisited??,"This book is incredibly biased. So many things have changed in the funeral industry since the sixties, why did Mrs. Mitford fail to recognize this in her revisited edition? Do not believe everything you read, the funeral industry is not evil. Also, when Mrs. Mitford expired she ironically had an enormus funeral! I would not suggest reading this book, it was a waste of my time."
4,Wry Observations of Funeral Biz,"I grew up across the street from a funeral parlor whose undertaker was a family friend, so the whole funeral experience always interested me. This book ""opens the lid"" so to speak on that business.Jessica's keen observations are laugh-out-loud funny at times. When this book was first released it really upset the boys in the undertaking biz.The book contrasts the American way of death with the British way, a great read in itself.Personally I preferred the first half of the book before the later chapters where the narrative kinda bogged down with statistics. This book has become a classic that should not be missed."
1,Poor Cheap Plastic Gimmick,I saw what I THOUGHT was the same set and Wms&Sonoma and then found these online. I bought them from Amazon since they were much cheaper. They are all plastic and arrived damaged. The clear plastic portion was broken on the salt mill and would not attach to the top portion. The pepper mill was cracked as well. They are very light weight and cheaply made. Get the real ones from the retail store. They are solid aluminum and real glass. I did. Amazon was pretty good about the return- after two phone calls to get my money credit back.
4,Very good but could be better.,"If you do a lot of cooking this is a convenient gadget to have. Single-handed pepper grinding can be a great thing when cooking. The light, though it sounds gimmicky, is a also beneficial. Even though the peppercorn ""hopper"" is small, it last plenty long and is easy to refill. Drawbacks: Stainless steel grinding mechanism instead of ceramic and the grind setting is very difficult to adjust (I just found a grind I like and haven't touched it since)."
2,Not stainless steel,"Contrary to the product description, this product is not 100% stainless steel. The top part is plastic. Does not feel as durable and the activation button needs to be pressed in just the right place.Mill works fine when you active the button in just the right place, and the light works too.Comes with a spare bulb and is preloaded with pepper."
1,poor item,"I ordered a set of these (both a salt mill & a pepper mill). They both arrived in very poor condition. The salt mill's finish was EXTREMELY damaged on the top of it. The pepper mill had very damaged finish on it's sides. They looked like someone had taken sandpaper to them in various areas. In addition to that, they appeared cheap & not constructed well. They need to go back to the drawing-board with these salt/pepper mills."
1,Which is the criterion to establish the price of a report?,"Good comment Karen. 3500 a report of MDM (inclusive IDC), is incomprehensible.:!!!!! 8 Pages!!!!!.TDWI have excellent reports of MDM, more extensive and a minor price."
5,Great for price.,"As someone who is used to and has paid two- three times the price of this one for an automatic level I admit I was almost skeptical of this. But I found a used one on Amazon and thought what the heck. It came right away and if it was ever used I couldn't tell. First plus. Then I took and used it numerous times in demanding conditions and it never failed to work accurately and as well as I could have expected from a more expensive level so I am quite pleased with this purchase. I have seen hand levels sell for as much as this cost. Does everything a unit costing twice as much does and is not awkward or difficult to use- stays level, focuses well, clear etc. Of course I mount it on a first grade tripod which I know is half the battle with any of these optical levels or lazers."
1,"Good idea, horrible editing","It's always nice to see a new book on Atheism on the shelves. I'm one of those who believe that human beings will never become intellectually mature unless they dump their belief in the supernatural. Beach Blanket Atheism would be a decent primer for the budding atheist, or a refresher-type reference for the more hard core IF it were edited by someone other than what looks to be a third grader with a spelling and reading problem. I mean, c'mon, it's ASIMOV, not AZIMOV (p. 62). And I lost track of all the times I read lists of names in this book (such as atheist/agnostic name lists) that contained name repetitions. In sum, there's way too many repeats, misspellings, and other howler-type errors in this book to make it anything other than embarassing."
3,Where are the references?,"The author has a great sense of humour, and I always appreciate a writer who does not take himself overly seriously. But here's the problem; a large part of the book is made up of quotes from other authors but with hardly a footnote or specific reference to where the quotes were found. This makes it very difficult to check the context in which the quoted statements were made.And this is not really an investigation of the topic but rather a just a promotion for atheism."
5,Mathquest excellent!,We got this for my son when he was 6-7 and it was outstanding. It was fun and very educational. The different ability levels made it useful for awhile -- he didn't outgrow it for years. I highly recommend it!
4,The power of the Nunchaku!,"Fumio Demura has presented us once again with a solid and superb text on this classical Karate weapon. The text is full of clear and precise photos and detailed explanantions of the basics. Sensei Demura covers the history, basic stances,strikes and blocks of this fascinating weapon. Also covered is a range of defensive techniques against the empty hand and various weapons.This book is a must for the beginner of Karate and Weaponry and even experienced Martial Artists should give it a consider."
4,good choice for visual discipline,"A continous step for improvement is discipline and visualization, with this book you will have a nice good visual guide to perform exercises to get you at beginner-intermediate levels on this ancient weapon, an enlightment for martial arts devotes.Fostered by Master Fumio Demura lessons you will have the chance to discover numchaku can perfom as a natural extension of the body, a mastery that cannot be achieved else by training.The book dated from 1971, with his simple look, methodic and short redaction,ilustrations in Black and White could led you to bad evaluation, keep focus that the book is an expression of japanese art, indeed it will portrait the functional purpose and beauty of simplicity that japanese culture evokes."
4,Introducing Nunchaku,This book is an excellent source for students who have never held nunchaku. (Though I do recommend having an instructor teach you the basics). A great value when I bought it in 1971.
1,Disposable Heroes are exacly that... let Burroughs SPEAK!!,"The Disposable Heroes have ruined these readings. This CD would have been great if not for the ridiculously cheesy white boy elevator ""jazz"" muzak and the ""so urban it hurts"" cliched drum machine samples and Jamaican guy pretensiously farting a few of W.S.B.'s words in his ""oh so cool"" poetry-slam nonsense. Don't bother with this if you are a lifelong Burroughs reader. You will be very disappointed. This is nothing more than a schoolboy's effort to introduce Burroughs to an audience of contemporary urban hipsters with short attention spans. Get ""Call Me Burroughs"" or ""Dead City Radio"" instead, trust me."
2,crap,1st I could not really tell if Jennifer was really black. Yeah I know she was fat because Mrs. Lee reminded us of this on every page! This one was crap . I really liked the other books but this one was ended badley to. [...]. I usually like Marilyn lee but this one was pure crap and reminded me of skin deep which better.
1,Not so much,"Did I listen to the other reviews? No, I had to find out for myself! This is not as good as The Fall of Troy, the first book. This book was lacking so many areas, namely taste. AND it is not worth $6.00. Do yourself a favor and just read The Fall of Troy!"
4,Good book,"This book kept me interested, but it did have some parts that seems a little pushed like the author got lost and just continued writing until she finally found her way back to what made the story good in the first place. Good Read"
2,BWWM....NOT!,"I just want to know why this book was tagged under BWWM. The female lead character was obviously caucasian with a biracial best friend. And I also want to know why the cover of the book makes it look like the lead is African American yet it is never mentioned in the book. Grey eyes,long dark hair and weight are the only physical details we learned about her. Very disappointed....."
2,Merely Okay at Best.,"I usually love romance novels featuring BBWs, but I can't say the same for this one. I didn't realize it was erotica when I bought it so I was kinda turned off by the graphic language and descriptions. It would have been forgivable if there was more substance to this story, but there isn't. It was predictable and there was no climax (no pun intended) to speak of. Also the dialogue was crass and just didn't ring true, especially between Jennifer and her friend. There was a scene where two characters discussed the difference between porno literature and erotica, and ironically I'm inclined to think that this is more porn than erotica. I'm disappointed that I wasted my time reading it and even worse that I spent money on it. If you can borrow it from a library, go for it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. For higher quality romances featuring BBWs try Bet Me, The Next Big Thing, or He Loves Lucy."
5,wow! great!,this is soooooooooooch a god book it maight not look good but dont judg a book by its cover i highly recamond tood strasser books ther funny instersing and cool!buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,100 Best Classics from the movies,"A pleasant set of disks. Good performances and decent quality sound. Disappointing in that I was expecting 100 Main themes from movies, and there are only 3 or 4. The rest are classical music that happens to have been used in movies."
4,JUST OK,I'm not a connoisseur of classic music so i buy this set because another review says its a great introductionWell the cds are very enjoyables but undoubtedly it is not for meNext i will try with some opera music.No soy un conocedor de musica clasica asi que compre este juego de cds porque alguien menciono que es un buen comienzoLa musica en los discos es escuchable pero definitivamente no es que me llegueAhora estoy buscando algo similar pero de opera
4,It's like having a season of newspapers wrapped into one.,Once you pick it up you won't put it down. Good quick reading on a spectacular season. Relive it over and over again.
5,An important book for all educators,The value of reflective teaching is not recognized nearly enough in recent research. This book convincingly documents the need for culturally relevant pedagogy in today's public schools. A worthwhile read.
1,Beneath Contempt.,"Avoid this book like the plague.The writers employ the stock-in-trade of the tribe of ""educators"" (what a misleading appellation): they attempt to provide a scholarly veneer to what is essentially hack work by citing a plethora of other equally worthless writers and pieces of ""research""."
4,Telescopic Walking Cane,Pricey for what it is. Telescopic hiking poles of the same design and material cost half as much. I never did find out how the so-calles anti-shock system worked.
5,fantastic cane!!!!!!,"I need a cane for use every day due to nerve damage in my left leg so the cane becomes my left leg. I have bought alot of different canes and the last one was advertised to support 500 pounds, and came with a life time warranty, after my 3'rd cane and that one was starting to bend I got fed up and saw the Leki cane. I use to cross county ski alot before I got injured and own a pair of Leki adjustable poles which work fantastic. I purchased the Leki wanderfreund cane and used it very hard the first couple of days that would really destroy any cane that I own and it took everything that I could throw at it. I take the tip off outside and the carbide tip really works great, it also just snowed so I took off one of my snow baskets from my ski poles and put it on my cane and it worked super. The bottom line is you cannot find a better cane both for looks or performance there is no match!!!"
3,The book covers all the basic elements of XSL,The book covers the basic definitions of XSL and it's utlity in data extraction from multiple document formats. The narration is simple and user friendly.-Seshu Kanuri
3,Trans Am book review.,"This book should not be viewed as a great technical manual. There is some good information in this book, but is not a complete resource text. It does however have good pictures of T.A.'s in stock and modified form. It is out of print, but I still have a copy in excellent condition. shape."
4,Freestyle Delivers for Wrestling Fans,Dan Gable is certainly one of the best freestyle wrestlers to ever step on to the mat. He was clearly an excellent and successful coach as well. This documentary takes you through his history and provides solid background information. The only criticism I have - is that it should have included more footage of Dan's actual matches...but overall an excellent DVD.
1,Dont waste your money.,"This book is a handfull of badly written questions with answers that are so specific, unless you are doing the exact project/task they mention, the answers are totally useless. These are all trade specific answers. If youre a pipe fitter, or professional fabricator I would think you'd have a better way of learning than this book. Also the lack of an index makes this book infuriating to try and use as reference. Thank god I got this book free. Too bad there's not an option for zero stars.Also note that all of the other reviews for this book are either anonymous or written by Mr. Tallman who is related to the illustrator."
3,I would have preferred the longer one,"I am no Cats fanatic, and I thought that buying the ""Selections"" CD at a lower price would satisfy me. However, I've watched the Cats movie too many times to count (I have a 4-year old who's obsessed), and was disappointed with the ""Selections"" CD. It's missing the Grizabella song (although it has a track titled ""Grizabella"", that's not really it) and other small pieces that I wish were included. The singing is not that great, save for Betty Buckley who sings Grizabella. She does a great job; however they tinkered with the music for ""Memory"" so it sounds like a really bad hit from the '80s.If you want a cheaper CD to share songs with your 4-year old, then this one is great. If you really enjoy the music to Cats, then maybe the other CDs are better. (I haven't listened to them, so I don't know for sure.)"
2,Not one of Andrew's best,"Even if you're a major fan of the live musical, I'm willing to bet the cast recording will be a bit of a dissappointment. The version I have is a two CD set with all of the tunes in it, and I'm thinking just having selections would be much better, so that you don't have to wade through all of the also-rans to get to the tunes that really work. Of course ""Memory"" is a stunning tune, though I've heard it 3 or 4 thousand times too often, and ""Mr. Mistoffolees"" is very catchy, though repetitive. The musical had a very clever concept and some brilliant dance and I think that may have distracted from how weak the music actually was."
3,It was okay,I've only recently gotten into Cats. This soundtrack is good but I prefer the filmed songs of The Rum Tug Tugger and Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer and especially Memory.Still beautifully done though.
5,A wonderful story for anyone with a quirky sense of humor.,"I recommend this book to many people as a wonderful twist on an old tale. The illustrations are delightfully spooky, and the violence is always off-scene. I am a great lover of animals and children who also are might be a tiny bit disturbed at the pets' disappearances. However, I especially appreciate it as a way to open up discussion about different cultural expectations and about parents knowing what's best for their children. The book is also great at giving clues; from Angelina's name to the family pictures on the walls, there are werewolf signals everywhere."
1,Didn't last long,I bought this monitor from amazon six months ago. The rechargeable aspect never worked well. Now the receiver no longer works. My old monitor from safety first worked for 4 years!!!
4,The best choice.,"There are two other ""best of"" collections-neither as good as this one. Jimmy Hall sings great(he still does)and the band seldom overplayed. Ricky Hirsch went on to play with some other folks, but never sounded as good on guitar as he does here. Will someone please rerelease ""Drippin' Wet""????????????..."
5,Martha's christmas revisited,"This was an older book, but, Martha is a classic and so are her books, beautifully photographed and filled with lovely ideas, easy to follow recipes and crafts for the holliday season. I am happy to add it to my library!"
2,Book is a Mixed Bag,"I agree this book is a very mixed bag...no 5 star winner or 1 star loser.However, I found the outsourcing information pretty commonplace and the case studies more like industry journal sidebars. The hang up may be that the authors try to convey in consultant format(i.e., sales brochure) what the other outsourcing books did in just as well in practical terms."
5,Worth Buying,This book's practical approach and no nonsense style go a long way to making the sourcing problem manageable. The assessment tools and frameworks were especially useful. Definitely worth buying.
1,"Too Weak On ""How-To""...Too Much Unusable Information","I found the book very boring and not anywhere as action-oriented as other outsourcing books I own. I did not gain anything new from this late entry in the outsourcing book market. I would not recommend it, especially if you're going to have just one book of outsourcing on your office bookshelf. After you shelf it, you won't pull it down again. Not much else to offer."
3,A disappointment,"This is the third volume of the trilogy written by Rolvaag before his death in 1931. The first volume, Giants in the Earth, was read by me Jan 14, 1946, with overwheolming appreciation. I re-read it 19 Aug 1069, preparatory to reading the second volume, Peder Victorious, which I finished 23 Aug 1969. I was not enchanted by that second volume and dicidied not to read the third volume, Their Fathers' God. But I recently came across that book and have now read it. It is the story of Per Hansa's widow and Peder, who has married an Irish Catholic girl and is farming in South Dakota. The tension between the couple over religion permeates and poisons the book, There are powerful scenes and events, including a stark account of the death of Peder's mother (Per Hansa' widow). But the book ends as I hoped it would not and that soured me on the book and I cannot call my reading one that I appreciated."
2,a let down,"After listening to the song ""lost in doubt"" Irushed into buying the album.A mistake, because ""lost in doubt"" is the only really good song and it appears in a victory compilation. The rest is not that bad, but NOT good either.Overpriced too."
1,"NOT ""Evening in Paris""","This is nothing like the ""Evening in Paris"" I used to buy in the little blue bottle. I read the reviews here and understood it wasn't quite the same. I was only hoping to have a hint of the past. That didn't happen. The MAIN ACCORDS are all wrong."
3,Not what I remembered,"The color of the bottle was cobalt, the same as years ago. But the bottle was very ""now."" The fragrance was VERY strong - not what I remembered.All in all, okay.Amazon is very good however. Came in a very timely manner."
3,New Scent,"I think like so many of us who grew up with EIP we looked upon this as something to rekindle those cherished memories from so long ago. For me it was a disappointment. Was it because my memory is not what I thought it was, or because my sense of smell is not as sensitive as it once was or has the formula changed? Given that we can walk into many antique malls and find EIP with enough residual scent to confirm our suspicion that the formula has changed I gave it 3 stars. The scent is not bad and like any perfume/cologne it appeals to some and not others. It just isn't the same formulation as the EIP of 1955."
4,Cool Bottle,"My wife mentioned she wore this when she was a kid and loved it. So when I found it one line, I grabbed it. As turns out she still loves the scent and the retro look of the bottle. I appreciate how it is not overbearing when she first puts it on like some others."
4,"The ""new"" Evening in Paris","I am a collector of the ""old"" Evening in Paris perfume sets. I was very excited to see this re-vamping of such a favorite. When I received it, I noticed that it was very close to the old smell but not quite. Plus, the staying power was not as lasting. I still would recommend it to anyone who has vivid memories of the original fragrance."
4,Nostalgia!,"This reminds me of the past. No not of the 'flapper girls' of the 1920's, but of the 1960's and early 1970's. I'm thankful that they have once again re-introduced this scent back into the market. I'm not sure if it was available even ten (10) years ago. It seemed to have gone the way of Dr. Nut soda (and if you are of a certain age from Louisiana you will remember both of these yesteryear products)."
1,Not the same,"I ordered this for my wife at Christmas. It arrived Jan.18 and my wife says it's nothing like Evening In Paris. The looks of the bottle is very miss leading, making you think that your are getting the original aroma. But no way"
3,Evening in Paris Perfume,This perfume was just sort of ok I think. It's not what I remembered it being many years ago. I wish companies would sell samples to try out rather then buying a whole bottle and not caring for it.
1,Not as described,"Most websites describe this fragrance as a soft, powdery floral. Amazon's website mentions only the scent of roses. Here is the description EXACTLY as it appears on the back of the box:""The top note is the subtle freshness of Bergamot with a refined and sweet middle note: a floral blend (Jasmin, Ylang-Ylang from the Comores islands, Turkish Rose and Violet-Iris notes) with a hint of Peach and a woody note of Cedar gives way to a sensual and powdery base of vanilla notes.""The scent of roses is completely undetectable and the only floral note that is truly discernible is Ylang-Ylang. Otherwise, it's ALL vanilla, heavy and nauseatingly sweet. Nothing fresh about it."
5,Soir de Paris,"Love it! Love it! Love it! The only thing is that it seems to be going away to quickly, but it might be my nose getting so used to it."
5,Excellent Quality for any Writing: A College Handbook,"The Fifth Edition of the Writing: A College Handbook is one of the best resources I have ever seen regarding effective writing. It should be a reference for anyone anywhere in any job requiring any level of writing - from letters to manuals to engineer specifications, etc. An excellent review of parts of speech, grammar, punctuation and all things related to the English language."
2,"Wow, the drama stories",Not what I expected and thankful for kindle refunds. This book has a lot of awful and sad stories related to physicaL and sexual abuse that is trying to tie in the boundary issues. I can understand the effects for the characters involved. As I was reading a little more into the book (hoping it would get better) I found myself more caught in the stories to deteremine the point of the book (for my situation). This isn't at all what I was looking for but perhaps others with similiar childhood stories would find it helpful and can relate it better. This book just wasn't for me.
4,Boundaries- where you end and I begin,"Great book. Very educational, I would recommend it to anyone having boundary issues."
3,ok book ....I've read better....,Ok book ....I've read better........Boundaries - Where You End And I Begin: How To Recognize And Set Healthy Boundaries.....I donated it to the public library!~I stopped and did not waste my time finishing it!`
3,Do People Grow Up Not Knowing This?,"If you don't want to answer a question or get personal with someone, then don't. PERIOD. Was an entire book neccessary?"
5,"Helpful, if you're ready for the assistance","I've been searching my entire life, and didn't know for what until Anne Katerine codified it for me in ""Boundaries"". It has not been a pleasant ""awakening"" but I was ready to have revealed to me what needed to be so that I can go to work on the healing process.The book was particularly helpful to me as a woman in that it helped me to define some of my childhood recollections as boundary violations that have affected subsequent relationships with men."
1,Disappointed,"No real practical advise.It seems to me that boundaries are somewhat personnel.Yet the author treats them as if they are absolutes.Apparently someone asked her if she every had an abortion.She commented that such a person could never beher friend. Apparently because the person did notrecognize the universality of the authors boundariesShe also tends to see men in a negative light;rapist, alcoholics, controlling, domineering.Women are portrayed as victims."
3,"Solid book, unoriginal material","Well, I guess I don't know what came first, but I felt like the book didn't really give me new tools beyond what I'd learned in books like Narcissism and Intimacy. However, I'm sure this would be a great book if it was the first read I'd had. It's also solid and useful regardless. The exercises are a little cheesy but it's encouraging that there are concrete things to try. Important lessons are contained, so if you haven't read anything about boundaries before, I would highly recommend it!"
2,for women only,"This seems to have been written mainly for women who have suffered some sort of sexual abuse. It may be useful for such women, but for anyone else with boundary problems, I'd recommend the same author's ""Where to Draw the Line."""
2,boundaries,This book was somewhat OK. I thought I would get a book that went into a little more detail.it is a goo starter book.
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for a book on how to establish healthy boundaries in everyday situations such as work and family. Specifically I was looking for positive ways to say no without ruffling feathers.I read about two thirds of this book and put it down because it is really geared towards women who can't say no to men's advances. Much of the content deals with abuse and incest.While this may be helpful to some, the title and description of this book were misleading to me."
3,Glad I read some of her other stuff first,"This book is okay. I think her book ""Where to Draw the Line"" was much better. Still this is a good workbook format and Dr. Katherine is the boundary master. Not sorry I bought it, but would recommend going to the other book first."
5,Personal situations,it shows how to work through many personal situations that I have found myself involved in.I will now be able to solve many problems between me and my wife.
1,Very disappointing,"I always look for the good in a Holmes pastiche, since the author selected such an excellent protagonist. I had a hard time finding the positive in this collection of three short stories.The first story was simply dull and dragged on. It took me three tries to complete it.The second story was pretty much a variation on Doyle's classic, The Red Headed League. It's already been done: and quite well!The final tale had as silly an ending as any Holmes story I have read.The unifying theme of these three stories is that Holmes is battling against his nemesis, Professor James Moriarty. Thus, the title. There are extremely well done Moriarty pastiches out there by John Gardner and Michael Kurland. A Duel With the Devil was a poor collection in comparison. Buy something else."
5,Moriarty Lives!,"This book is exactly what the Holmes cannon needed: more about Holmes VS Moriarty prior to the latter's supposed death. In other words what drove Moriarty? What crimes did he supervise that caused Holmes to first sense a master hand in crime? What were the times which he enumerates to Holmes at their famous standoff in Holmes' Baker Street flat? To Mr. Roger Jaynes, I say, like Oliver Twist, ""Please, sir, I want more!"" Five Sherlock Stars! Quoth the Raven..."
3,"Sterling Silver ""Fly"" Pendant",Really cute and adorable but the actual pendent is so tiny it's hard to see what it is.
2,Wrist Band Thermometer,"I purchased this Thermometer to wear on my watchband while cycling to be able to check the outside temperature. I guess you can't expect much for $8!Unless you have superb vision, the dial/numbers are totally unreadable and too small.The gauge reading is not even close to ambient temperature, but might do better if used for diving.Except for the fact that it looks'cool' and fits my watchband perfectly, it is worthless as an ambient thermometer.Summary: Very difficult to read and poor function.I would return it if it was expensive, but I would certainly not recommend it to my friends!John M Lapoint / San Diego, CA"
4,Misleading title,"I agree, this is a good CD. A collection of music chosen and commented on by members of UB40. To look at the album cover you would swear that it was a UB40 recording, but the track list gives it away. Nevertheless, this is mostly good music, well worth a listen. And the price was right!"
5,Great people!!!!,The first one we ordered had a dent that occurred probably during shipment. After reporting this to Poster Art they replaced it with one that was perfect and it arrived three days later. We would definitely recommend this business. We are happy customers!!!!
1,suction cup,the small suction cup broke off after two weeks using it. I would not buy again. The suction cup holds the feeder to the tank.
3,Fresh and varied styles sampler,"A sampler worth having. Anyone would find at least one of the tracks that suits them well, and all are a pleasure to explore for textures. I have a hard time releasing the player from Cono (track 4), which has a habit of finding the volume maximizer too. The voice and percussion DO. Some of the artists have spent a lot of time on intros, which may be why you haven't seen these cuts elsewhere, but once past the warmups, the sound is great. I use it for background music while working."
4,trike cover,"This was a very tight fit on my 2004 Honda California Sidecar conversion trike. I expected it to fit a little better, but it definitely will not blow off! The cover appears to be made of quality materials. I would have given it 5 stars if the fit was better."
3,"A bit overlong, but worth reading","About half of this book is good and worth reading. However, it seems at times like the author felt he needed to reach a certain page length and padded things out -- even at times going so far as to repeat word for word paragraphs from earlier chapters.The main information of value is in revving up the reader and restoring confidence, especially if they've been led to believe that they can't or shouldn't do something due to lack of education. It also has some exercises and advice that, depending on how close your problems and desires are to the author's, may or may not be of any use."
1,A waste of good money,"Do not know what all the hoopla is about with this book. It offers very little, if none, of any useful information to anyone who does not want to take the college path. The last time I will be influenced by ""reviews."""
3,Misleading Picture......Buyer Beware,"The set is not the one shown in the picture...and totally fooled me....the explanation does not state clearly either....very disappointed, and will have to find the teapot, sugar tray and milk pot somewhere....."
4,"good, but no original from england","good, but no original from england, i still think the best ones should made in england. the tray is a little small"
3,Two Words,"I have two words for you: Old Spice.The stuff is fine, but it's very much a watery Old Spice experience. Including the scent.This is alcohol free, however, which is probably its biggest selling point."
3,insecticide,This product didn't work as well as I had hoped. I followed the label's instructions but the bugs I had (mites) did not go away completely; they only moved on once the plants they were eating died.
5,Stunning,Stunning Greek music! Mezzo-soprano Agnes Baltsa brings her fiery sound and artistry to this collection that makes one wish they we're in Greece.
5,lovely,"I really loved the albumSongs My Country Taught Meby Agnes Baltsa and I came here hoping for more - unfortunately, this is exactly the same album! Too bad for me. But it might be good news for you, because this album is currently unavailable but that one is still very much available. Beautiful music! Seek out ""Savina Yannatou Sings Manos Hadjidakis"" as well. Hard to find, but I've never heard a better album of contemporary song. The songs of Hadjidakis are amazing. (The rest of his music that I've heard is more ""OK"" than ""amazing."")"
3,Double Fudge,"I liked this book because it is so hilarious. In this book there are more than ten Characters and some of them are hilarious Characters. This story is all about Fudge, his family and his friends. In this story Fudge needs to learn a lot about money because he thinks that money grows on trees and he does not know that you have to work hard to get money. This book has a lot vocabulary for ESL students and a lot people who do not know some words. This book is good and you should read it.THANK YOU for reading my review."
1,You get a photo copy of the actual manual!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The manual seems thorough, but they send you a photo copy!?!?! I got about a 1 inch stack of loose leaf paper. The front page is printed on peel and stick paper, which I don't know why??? Extremely disappointed. Oh, and it's in black and white, no color. So, don't let the picture of description mislead you like it did me. Pretty pathetic overall....."
3,Too brief,"The music is very cool but the CD only has four songs on it. It is like a teaser...making you want more. I guess they are just creating value and making us buy more CD's. The songs they do have are fantastic. (Consider it an incredible ""quickie"")"
3,Decent but not great.,I'll be brief on this one. This EP is OK but it leaves a lot to be desired. It has good beats but it lacks on melody. Dark and slow. It is just not as edgy as some of their other material. Good but kind of boring is the best way I can describe it.
4,Cool Game,This was a game I used to play with my kids years ago. I was glad to find it again and in great condition.
5,great views of France and Belgium,Know before you go! The perfect way to prepare for a visit to France and Belgium is to see what to expect. Rick Steves shows you.
3,DIDNT WORK ON MY SCHWINN,"GOOD, WELL MADE PRODUCT. I HAD TO MODIFY IT SO IT WOULD WORK ON MY 70 SCHWINN. PURCHASE SOME SHIMS AND IT SHOULD WORK."
2,they messed up--Erasure did better,"The Erasure boxed sets brought us EVERY mix off every 12"" vinyl single and CD single, and then some. This volume just brings us the same old import CD singles we could buy separately. Where is the Hijack remix of StrangeLove that samples People are People? And the Shep Pettibone megamix of Behind the Wheel/Route 66 from the 12""??? They've NEVER appeared on CD. What a missed opportunity."
5,Just the x-best!,This album bites like an alligata!Me and my bro listened to it back in the day non-stop. It was great then and even better now!Like rap? Get it! SISSYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!Peace
1,RACIST,"Im going to begin by saying that the beats are really well done (Even though it is VERY HEAVILY sampled), and the lyrics that are delivered are very intellectual, for a 90s state of mind; however there is one looming fact that makes this album crap. Imagine if a white rapper came out and said, ""I'll slap you with my white nazi hand!"" Would America be outraged? Of course. So why is it that everyone who has reviewed this album (and I'm willing to bet it is mostly blacks), are okay with what they say? I dare to say that this album is on the verge of pro-taliban talk. I mean it! There is so much I'm better than you are and God is telling me to prove it on this album that I see that direct corelation between the Taliban and the Xclan. Delve deep into there lyrics and you'll see. If you are empty minded and are just dancing to it, then its fine. If you really listen to what the rapper is saying, you should be outraged!"
3,Hardcore sampler.,All of these songs are available on other albums. This album's really only worthwhile if you're new to the hardcore scene and want to acquaint yourself with some of the bands.
4,A Jem of a Book!,"Some people do not understand the beauty of American Ways. They think that it merely depicts stories. The actual wonderful thing about this book is that it deals with stereotypes. Almost all of us, regardless of country, have certain pre-conceived notions regarding others. American Ways directly addresses foreigners stereotypes of Americans. The book is even bold enough to agree with the stereotypes at times. However, it typically dispels and explains the reasons for those stereotypes. This makes for a much richer understanding of aspects particular to American culture. Having previously taught English as a foreign language in China, I think that this book alone could inspire countless classroom discussions on a variety of aspects regarding Americans."
1,The author of this book has a problem,One of my Japanese friends is using this book in one of her high school classes. She has learned a very racist word in the book that is used againstItalians. I won't write it here. It is however very low class for anyone to use such terms. The author obviously has some very racist viewpoints.
1,A Disappointment,I found this book to be a real disappointment.This book does nothing to celebrate the diversity that exists in America. When reading it I have a sense that America is a country where all of the values are uniform and everything is done the same way. The author paints a very unrealistic and boring picture of the US.
2,Full of American Stereotypes,There is very little usefull information in this book. It plays on all of the stereotypes about Americans.
5,Deodato at his best * * * * * * * * * * * * *,"This is a superb album; I grew up listening to it and fell in love with it as years went by; It's got eveything Deodato always expressed in his music; talent, funk, jazz, rock, lots of keyboards, immagination, skills way ahead of his time. etc. etc.Black Dog was a classic back then and still is, and perhaps the best cut in the album is Adam's Hotel by Marcos Valle. A definite Must-Have for Jazz and Rock fans."
2,There are better Deodato albums out there,"Deodato is a great fusion jazz artist, but there is better albums, For a better selection check out Whirlwinds, Preludes & Rhapsodies & Artistry.As for this album, Crabwalk is one of the better tunes, as is Caravan/Watusi Strut. the rest is somewhat drivel, especially Black Dog. I havent heard many worse Led Zep covers.You will not be disappointed if you check out the others."
4,Great read,This is a great book and an excellent read. I would recommend it. I found it very unique and great ending.
5,for me a great read,"i enjoyed the suspense, the lack of vulgarity which is so common in order to try and get the reader's attention."
3,Hmm....this is difficult...,"On one end of the spectrum, I want to give this album 5 stars because Paz is bringing back some of his Ikon the Verbal Hologram style (on songs such as Saviorself), meaning he is spitting complex intelligent lyrics...but one the other end I want to give this album 1 star for pointless thug lyrics and tons of anti-gay and anti-christian lyrics (I am not gay nor am I christain, but it gets tiring after a while) So I will give it a score in the middle (3 stars)The way I would rank JMT's album1. (the best) Psycho-Social2. Violent By Design3. Legacy of Blood4. Visions of Gandhiso overall, this is a solid CD for JMT fans, but don't expect it to be 100% complex lyrics."
1,Crap,"I picked up Legacy of Blood and Visions of Ghandi. What a bunch of repetative garbage. Most every verse is blood, guts, kill, death...hardly a glimpse of intellect. It's really quite a shame because the beats are amazing (produced by Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind). Too bad Stoupe had to waste his production talent on this group, hopefully it was because he unfortunately couldn't find anyone else to work with. The only Jedi i will ever listen to again are instrumentals (if they're even available), and i will aviod the obnoxious, weak flows. I agree with the Ja Rule comparison, but JMT tries way harder to get ""murder cred."".If you want real hip-hop, buy some wu, roots, gang starr, tribe, pete rock, common, digable planets, afu-ra"
2,ARE YOU NEW TO JEDI MIND TRICKS??? PLEASE READ THIS!!!!!!!,"I COMPARE JEDI MIND TRICKS' STYLE TO SWOLLEN MEMBERS, NON PHIXION, OR DILATED PEOPLES. IF YOU LIKE THOSE GRAB THIS ONE. OTHERWISE.... FORGET ABOUT IT.NO WU-TANG AFFILIATION. THE STICKER IS A FAKE ATTEMPT FOR PUBLICITY.JEDI MIND TRICKS IS MOSTLY A FAT WHITE RAPPER (WHO SUCKS) AND SOME OTHERS WHO JUST CAN'T QUITE BALANCE OUT THE DIFFERENCE.P.S. I TRIED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TO LIKE THIS GROUP, AND I ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY LIKE A GROUP THAT ISN'T COMMERCIAL...BUT JEDI MIND TRICKS SUCKS."
4,A very good album...,"But not their best. Well, even that has a string or two attached. In my opinion, they will never surpass Visions. That album... was incredible. ridiculously so. As in, not fair to every other rapper in JMT's sub-genre (I dont have a name for it, but you know what i mean- Canibus, Immortal Tech, Jean Grae, Murs in a really bad mood). But on this one, I just am not quite as impressed. Vinnie, well, he just doesnt seem as raw. He's getting more talented as an MC, but his subject matter isnt keeping up, so it seems a litte strange. All of that said, Stoupe (the producer) is just the best ever at what he does. There is nothing left to say. Listen to both mixes of ""On the Eve of War,"" and you will recognize that he is the best. These two are RIDICULOUS. Pick up this album, f'sho. But it is their 3rd best work- get Visions of Gandhi and Violent by Design first."
3,nice,this cd is hard as expected. theres a new underground group buzzin out of Chicago called All Player that has similar technique and material to aotp. they sound like the next era of rap. i was blown away. check em out here on amazon just type in Historical records and All Player. its called HRAP Chapter 1. gotta say...its in the top 5 albums of the year. production is great and the artists are ILL. they got more at [...]. they seem to be the most slept on talent in the underground.
4,Much Better Than Visions of Ghandi,"After listening to Legacy of Blood I have to agree that it's better than Visions of Ghandi. But not better than Violent By Design. I don't know it just seems like something is missing from this album. Maybe they need to get Jus Allah back. I'm not saying that Vinnie Paz can't hold down an album, I'm just saying that they compliment each other better than Vinnie holdin it down solo. Standout tracks are: The Worst, And So It Burns, The Philosophy of Horror, and On The Eve of War (Chavez Mix)"
3,its aight,"Well I was at Best Buy one day and they didn't have any of the CDs I was looking for.Anyways then I saw this CD and since I heard it had tight beats and lyrics, I decided to check it out.Honestly though, I was disapointed. All of the beats sounding the same IMO, besides three.The lyrics were aight but got pretty boring. The homophobic comments made throughout the album didn't help any. And all songs were Im gonna kill you themed.With that, the sound quality of the dudes voice wasn't produced very well either. It was somewhat boring.I did give it three stars though because the wordplay was pretty clever even if it did get boring. Its listenable. I like a few songs.Overall, its not horrible."
2,"Wicked beats, terrible mc","Vinnie Paz has become one of the most borning rappers I have ever heard. U can predict everything he will say because it is exactly what Ja Rule would say. The beats really are good, as ever with JMT, but I find myself not wanting to listen to this as Vinnie just says the same same thing over and over again, ""I'm going to kill you"" or ""die mother F*cker"". Really boring album as a result."
5,MASTERPIECE,"Building from the solid production explored on VOG, Legacy Of Blood brings strong lyricism back to the raw duo known as Jedi Mind Tricks. Vinnie Paz, after abandoning his Ikon persona, is a much-better balanced blend of insight and raw anger on this effort. Stoupe, as always, makes the entire album beg for an instrumental co-release. Songs like ""Scars Of The Crucifix"", ""Saviourself (ft. Killah Priest)"", and even the hidden track ""Without A Plan (ft. Des Devious)"" all possess a raw, orchestral Stoupe-masterpiece that is flawlessly matched with a well-crafted verse from an increasingly-capable Vinnie Paz. Little guest appearances, more raw JMT exposure, and an overall strong album. Even the interludes are worth replaying over and over. Buy this or miss out on a masterpiece of Hip-Hop that should be handed out like Bibles."
4,shakespears Christmas,"I loved this book, Even though I could only get it on Amazon, it has been out of print for a few years. I was well worth waiting for, so I could read the series in order. I loved the entire series, I wish Ms. Harris would write another Lily Bard Book."
1,Ho Ho Hum,"This was the only installment of the Lily Bard series I had not read because there were only two copies in my county's entire library system (versus the half-dozen copies of the others). Now I know why it was given so little representation on the bookshelves. I saw this mystery coming a mile away, and midway through chapter four I lost my patience and headed straight for the end. This is not the same Lily Bard in the earlier installments -- she's overly occupied with her clothing (and ye gods, the descriptions are awful). I can't believe Charlaine Harris wrote this, it's so uninspired. Luckily, I had also checked out a copy of ""Grave Sight,"" her newest series, which had me hooked with the first paragraph."
3,shakespeare's christmas,"""Shakespeare's Christmas"" is not the strongest entry into the Lily Bard series. The main problem is that the story is not set in Shakespeare, AR among all of the quirky, small town characters we have come to know & love. Lily travels back to her hometown of Bartley, AR, so we have a new cast of characters to deal with. They just aren't as charming or interesting. Couple the Bartley setting with a so-so mystery, and the result is boring. I recommend this book only to those who are already fans of Charlaine Harris."
5,Shakespeare's Christmas,"I loved this book! Then again I love anything that is written by Charlaine Harris. She is a fabulous writer, I get lost in her books."
2,Good story but the writing was pretty awful.,"The story of Lilly Bard visiting her family for her sister's wedding and helping solve a mystery with her detective boyfriend was pretty good. Not having read any of the previous titles in this series, it was hard to decipher some of the references to things that had gone on before (where exactly are those scars, and how were they inflicted??). My main beef with this book is that the writing is full of nonsequiturs, very choppy, and generally in need of a good editor. It was hard for me to continue reading sometimes because I was thinking how some of the sentences and even paragraphs could have been reconstructed to read more smoothly and make more sense. Am I the only reader who feels this way? Sorry, Charlaine, but St. Martin's Press should assign you a good editor in the future."
4,Great Series for Harris Fans,"I first fell in love with Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series. I like Lily Bard even better. Basically, Lily is a cleaning woman that was brutally attacked. raped and nearly killed years before the series takes place. While this attack has definately shaped Lily's character, we meet her at a time when she is finally coming to terms with everything that has happened to her and who she's become.What sets this series apart are the supporting characters and the description of life in a small town. While the crimes commited in the book are intruiging enough to keep you turning the pages well into the night, it is the people that Harris writes about that make you head to the bookstore first thing in the morning for the next installment.The series is in this order: Shakespeare's Landlord, Champion, Christmas, Trollop and Counselor.According to Harris' website, she does not plan on continuing the Lily BArd series at this time. Boo."
4,Shakespeare's Christmas,Great book. Can't help but cheer Lily on and look for justice for the bad guys. I strongly recommend it. CS
3,"Fun, easy read","This is a fun easy read. If you read the other books in the series, you know something is going to happen to Lily. But, Charlaine's books always have a unique side to them even if you know that there will be drama in the main character'a life."
5,Harris delivers!,Charlaine Harris always delivers a good mystery! I would recommend this series to everyone.
4,best in series,this is by far the best in the lily bard series. we finally get to meet lily's family and there's a great mystery to solve in her home town. lily is also coming out of her shell more. definitely recommend.
4,loved this forgotten book,"I am a fan of anything Charlaine Harris writes, so when I saw that this had been brought out again...I was tickled. I already finished the Lily Bard series, so it was like going back in time to read this one which is I believe is #3 in that series. She is not writing anymore on this character, so I am glad to have that series complete. It was as good as all the others. Sorry she won't be adding anymore to Lily's storyline.. I have to wait until 2009 for another Sookie book!"
4,Fast Paced Mystery With Great Characters,"Lilly Bard is a very interesting character. Her life has been shaped by a brutal assault and rape when she was young. Now, at age 31, she has worked her way back to a fairly normal life. She is strong, capable, and a little prickly, but likeable. In this, the third book of the series, Lilly has returned to her hometown for her sister's wedding. Along with her boyfriend, Jack (a private investigator), she is trying to piece together several recent murders in town that may or may not be related to a child abduction eight years previously. The premise for this story is a good one and it is very well plotted, but it is the characters that make it special. I haven't read the two previous books in this series, but I didn't feel lost. In fact, the references to past events just added a little more mystery. I am looking forward to getting to know these characters better in the earlier and future books in this series."
4,Ho ho ho...,"In this 3rd installment into Miss Lily Bards life, we are treated to a trip back to Lilys hometown. Varena, Lilys sister, is getting married and Lily is to be her maid of honor. While away, Lily gets herself involved in yet more trouble when she stumbles across two bodies in a doctors office.Shakespeares Christmas didnt disappoint. There was murder, mystery, humor...and Jack. Oh how Im loving Jack.This is another great addition to the series. Read it."
2,"If you're looking for a book like the Sookie Stackhouse novels, this isn't it..","I purchased this series after burning through the Sookie Stackhouse novels, hoping that it would be as good. While the plot lines were interesting, the character development is minimal and the characters themselves are not as likeable. The books themselves seemed to short - the story line could have been expanded on and given more detail and the characters could have been more depth."
5,An early 20th century classic on the act of faith,"The question of what goes on -- rationally, psychologically, and in terms of grace -- when a person comes to belong spiritually to God in Christ -- the theology of the ""act of faith"" -- has long been one of the most difficult questions in theology. Jean Mouroux tackles it bravely and profoundly, to make for one of my favorite theology books. He combines a deep knowledge of St. Thomas Aquinas and St. John of the Cross on the relation of intellect, heart, and faith, with a powerful ""personalist"" approach, a little uncommon in the time between the Vatican councils, that didn't allow theology to become abstract conceptual analysis, but came at the relationship between God and the soul with a more properly calibrated intelligence. And he keeps it short! If you're not theologically trained, you'll probably prefer A. Carrel's classic ""A Journey to Lourdes"", which is similarly penetrating but much more narrative in style."
4,Almost exactly............,"Really nicely finished bars just did not work out, because of my hand position....not the bars fault, I need to get another stem......"
2,So So product,"I am 53 years old and being a recent denture wearer for almost one year, I've learned a lot about what to use and not. I like Polident Dentu*Gel 100% better than the creme. The gel is much less abrasive on the dentures than the creme plus the creme is more difficult,at least for me, to clean off the toothbrush. If I have to use the creme because I run out of toothpaste I do, but again the gel is by far, far much better."
4,Fruit Press,"Well made heavy duty screw, 7/8 diameter. Easily adequate for a bench vise or a fruit press. Item comes exactly as pictured, no jaw or plate attachment hardware."
3,Great value - mediocre threads,"At less than $32, Shop Fox's Bench Screw is a terrific value....for a Chinese-made precision tool. The threads are nice and course (about 5 tpi); however, they were cut poorly, and have visible scoring/grooves on the outside edges. Also, the two threads appear to have been cut independently of each other, resulting in very uneven spacing between the two thread sets.Also, the tapped threads in the nut (provided) are so loose on the died threads on the screw that the not rocks back and forth about 1/8"" in all directions.Bottom line, the nut spins freely of it's own rotational inertia for several revolutions at all points along the screw, and I think it will function well for my humble tail vise.It figures, after I ordered the Shop Fox, I stumbled on this extraordinary deal: a 21"" genuine ACME-threaded bench screw for just $37.50, c\\\. Consider buying Lee Valley's excellent quality bench screw: [...]"
2,An essential part for it was not supplied.,"The bearing plate required for the movable wood jaw was not supplied, hence, the screw was not a suitable replacement for my old one. Thus, it was returned to you."
5,Review of Star Trek: Captain's Table,"I have read over 100 Star Trek books and I can say for certain that the Captain's Table books are some of the best. They are six different stories about six Starfleet Captains: James T. Kirk, Jean-Luc Picard, Benjamin Sisko, Kathryn Janeway, Christopher Pike, and MacKenzie Calhoun. Each story is quite fascinating and as you read them they are tied together by an overall plot about the mystery of the Captain's Table. Some of them do have adult material however, so I wouldn't let children read them. The Captain's Table books are a very fun Star Trek read!"
1,Disappointing,"A rather disappointing book, regrettably. Ligia Ochoa attempts to jump start the beginner into spanish correspondence and at the same time to guide an advanced student to perfection. In the end she achieves neither one nor the other. The vocabulary she includes is totally insufficient for a rookie, whilst the constant return to english is an annoying digression for advanced learners. The examples given are very limited in scope and don't always achieve exemplary quality.Perhaps Ochoa should have written two separate books to serve the different sections of the audience she aims to reach. As it is, with her actual book she serves neither."
4,Another Excellent Compton Effort,"Ralph Compton does it again. A great novel about the West, as seen through the eyes of Dutch Siringo, and his tougher-than-leather teamsters. I have read all of Compton's books and consider his work to be among the best of the Western novelists. I was saddened to hear of his passing and regret that he is no longer alive to give us pleasure in book form as he has so many times done. ""Adios, Pardner"""
2,Not worth the money...,"I bought this book with great expectations, but it was another one that just did not grab my attention. I finally gave it to the church library.It wasn't for me, but it might be just the book for someone else!"
4,WHY TO WATCH THIS FLICK,"guys,the reasons to watch this flick are:1) jonna lee.2) the movie is brain candy. enjoy."
2,not so good...,"I picked up this DVD because it was filmed in my hometown of Memphis and it seemed to be billed a pretty funny ""1980s"" movie.But the film is mostly disappointing, plauged with bad acting and poor production quality. The fat kid from ""Head of the Class"" was the saving grace, but most of the characters, including Judd Nelson, were just so wooden. I don't think they had a very good script to work with either. The laughs come few and far between. And Judd Nelson talks like a normal guy, but reverts to this weird Italian thing where he struts around going ""yo"" whenever a good-looking girl is around.If you want to see a funny ""1980s"" type of movie that takes place in a school, why not go for REAL GENIUS, SIXTEEN CANDLES, BETTER OFF DEAD or SAY ANYTHING. See? I just thought of four better movies just off the top of my head.Maybe I was expecting too much. I really did want to like it, but there are definitely better movie choices out there."
4,Funny,"A very funny freshmoric (not a word but one can gather my meaning) movie. There are some great one liners that should be remembered along with all those other ""guy"" movies (e.g. ""animal house"", ""caddyshack""...)"
4,Unknown '80's movie,This was one of my favorite least known '80s movies. Except for Nelson most of the actors were/are relatively unknowns. That doesn't stop this film from having a lot of the things that will remind you of how funny the '80s were.
4,Making the Grade...,"Along with another reviewer, I saw this movie on cable back in the 80's. I also enjoyed this flick (though I don't really remember why!). The price is right for cheap laughs. Four stars!"
5,Another '80s Drive-in Classic!,"I was surprised to see this movie available on DVD. It was a long time since I had seen this movie, and viewing it again brought back some great memories from the '80s. Judd Nelson plays a street kid that switches places with a rich guy, and goes to Prep School for him. Lots of Preppies, and laughs are what this movie is all about! This classic was a Golan & Globus Production, which also gave us movies like ""Breakin'"", and ""Invasion USA"" If you like '80s teem comedies, this one is a ""must have"" for your collection."
3,A LONG FORGOTTEN 80'S COMEDY! WELCOME HOME!,"I had not seen this comedy for at least 20 years, before watching this last night. I was surprised how many little moments I remembered, but did not realize they were from this movie! The film starts out a little cheesy,but does pick up once the premise has been set up. The movie feature Andrew ""Dice"" Clay in a small,but important role. Dice pulls off a couple of funny impressions of Travola and Pacino and plays his ""Dice Man"" to the hilt. I like the movie because it has not been over played and it does have it's moments. The cast is good, there is a little twist on the same old story and you gotta love that generic 80's music! The DVD transfer looks good."
2,I'm not impressed,"I like this version of Tupelo Honey but other than that, it sounds like Van's is trying to reinvent himself as a lounge singer. Don't get me wrong, he truly deserves to be called ""The Man"", but this is the soft-rock crap that most of his detractors despise. Elsewhere he makes good songs, both his own (Moondance, Gloria) and others (T-Bone Walker's Stormy Monday, Freddie King's Have You Ever Loved a Woman?, Sly Stone's Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin), James Brown's It's a Man's Man's Man's World) bad. I hate it when people do that. Loyal sidekick Georgie Fame is about as good as his name suggests (in other words, not at all), and it lacks the haunting mystique of Astral Weeks or the joy of Moondance. I listened to it once, and never played anything but Tupelo Honey again."
2,its ok,i received this as an xmas gift and its ok i wanted it for my collection gotta listen more bye
5,"If you like Van the Man, you'll love this!","This album seems to have been crafted for fanatics of the music of Van Morrison, people whose energy builds as he belts out a song, those among us who feel that few (if any) singers in the last 40 years have put more soul into their singing. ""Gloria"" will make you laugh, ""Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?"" will reach deep into your heart, in fact every song on this two-cd set will emotionally touch you. It is live music at its best, right there with The Band's ""The Last Waltz"" and Joe Jackson's 2-CD set. Fabulous!"
3,"The ""Vanlose"" Here Is 10 Times The Original","You've got to hand it to a man who can sing a song about a metaphysical stairway and make it sound sexy. I never understood what Van was doing with ""Vanlose"" on BEAUTIFUL VISION. He sang it like he was passing kidney stones. Here, you still can't understand anything he is saying, but you can sure feel it. And the sax and guitar lines really do something. ""Send me some lovin' / send me some kissin' / You know it's you I'm missin'"", Yeah!"
5,I am No Expert But,"Will I am no expert in music. But I know what I hear and I sure know what I like. This is one of the best live performances that I have listened to. There is nothing to be said about Van Morrison that his fans do not know..But the arrangement the intensity of the music. The harmony that you can clearly identify in songs like it ""is a man's man's world"" is just tooo greatAgain we find John Lee Hooker in this CD along with some great performers and musiciansThis CD is a must have. No matter what type of music you like you will love this CD"
3,Great Keyboard but power consuming monster mouse,"This duo has a great keyboard but when it comes to the mouse, it hogs a lot of power and after a while the optical leds stop funtioning rendering the mouse useless.I would still highly recommend the keyboard for a versatile design and pretty good features."
2,Relegated to the Donation Box,"Looked like it should work, but it didn't have all the parts to hook it up. Rattled like something was rolling around inside the body of the keyboard. After a futile trip to an office supply store to find the missing part, I gave up and bought a different one. Oh, well...gave it to Goodwill."
5,Excellent,I was happy to get my order before expected. Also it was in perfect condition. I will continue to do business with Amazon and recomend it to my friends and family.
2,Don't waste your money on this,"This book is useless! It basically just outlines Iggy and if you've already made outlines while reviewing, why shed another $30 for this?! Just study the questions on the CD that came with Iggy (or the online questions on Elsevier's website) and re-read your notes again and you won't need this! And yes, this book has a lot of mistakes and as nursing majors, we can't afford to waste time on looking facts that our books are supposed to give us! Stay away from this book!"
1,recycled internet messages,This book was very disappointing. Too much of the book is just a transcription of chatter on miscellaneous baseball-related subjects from an e-mail listserve or stuff available on AOL. The book is hardly worth reading even if you overlook the fact that the recycled material is a ripoff.
1,Katie Brown Entertains,"This book is filled with very unatttractive projects and recipes that call for packaged this and bottled that. Many of the recipes don't make sense-cooking mustard greens for one minute, for example, would make them inedible and using dried parsley in a culinary no no. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Katie Gives Martha a Run for Her Money,"Whether she realizes it or not, Katie Brown is competing to become the new young hip Martha Stewart. This book is so fabulous even for the not so creative decorator, like myself. Her ideas are fresh, classy and beautiful. This full colored decorating ""bible"" includes suggestions for any event imaginable! You will never need to purchase another book on decorating again!"
4,It's a keeper,I saw the cover of this book and had to open it immediately. I have been a fan of Katie's for a long time and I was so happy to see her big orange book. I recreated the entire Hopscotch chapter for my son's birthday and it was a huge hit with the children and the adults.Katie is so refreshing and a real inspiration.This book is definitely a keeper!
4,"Big Book,Bright Ideas",I really love this book. I like the combination of recipes and tablesettings.It gives me everything I need to create the perfect party. I've used ideas from each chapter whether it's a recipe or a project there's always something I want to try.Katie Brown's approach is so approachable.
5,katie is so hot,I got this book for one reason. that is katie brown. katie is so hot I can not wait for her new tv shows this fall on hgtv and the food network.
1,Save your money,"The design is very slick and looks like a hip website, but this book is anything but hip. The recipes look like they could be from a children's cookbook, until you realize how much effort they require. My least favorite ""project"" was a napkin ring made from bolts on a notebook paper ring... just plain ugly. Other projects, such as the artichoke picture holder, I remember seeing on her old show. The pages and pages of her personal anecdotes might be interesting to her family and friends, but come off as self-absorption, and the two FULL pages of acknowledgements speaks volumes. I suppose we consumers can handle all this work ourselves, but it seems Ms. Brown needs a giant staff to help her set a table."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"I have heard people refer to Katie as a less fussy version of Martha, but to me it comes across as trite and overtly superficial. It's as if she is trying so hard to be ""less fussy"". I will be the first to admit that some of Martha's projects are insanely fussy, but at least they are pleasing to the eye. I just can't say the same for Katie's stuff."
1,What a waste of money!,"This was a total waste of money. The projects are dumb; I don't think there is one I would even consider doing, and they're more appropriate for pre-schoolers -- e.g., for a favor, pour maple syrup into little bottles and top each with a pinecone. IMHO, that would be great if you had your own maple trees and were sharing your own syrup, but repouring a little from a jar you bought is just stupid. And that was one of the better ideas in this stupid book. I can't believe they went to press with this dumb thing; what a waste of money."
2,"Ummm, who's going to do this?","All I have to say is who is going put together these decorations? If you come over to my house for a party, don't worry about having to eat on sod place mats, it just won't happen. I would never put in this much effort to decorate for a dinner party. I was so turned off by the goofy-themed party ideas, I didn't even read any of the recipes - they might be good, I just couldn't handle looking at this book any longer."
4,"A Katie, yes, but a Martha? No!","I remember watching Katie Brown on lifetime tv and thinking that she had such great ideas. I would often use her wonderful recipes or ideas in my own home. So when I saw this book I thought, wow, she's got a book. So I bought it. Yes, it has some good ideas, and yes it had some good recipes, but it's missing something! The 16 occasions, menues, and tables, just didn't flow. And some of the ideas could have already been thought of before. If you're a huge fan of Katie, then I would recommend it, but if not, head on over to the Martha Stewart selection cause you'll be much happier."
1,Junk,"I don't know if we did something wrong, I believe we followed the directions to a tee, but it didn't work for anything. The pasta came out slimy and undercooked and vegetables were simply warm and not cooked at all. Save your money and get a nice stainless steel pot with a collender in it. It is a multi-tasker that will give you years of service."
5,EMERGANCY! SEASON TWO,I LOVE WATCH EMERGENCY WHEN I WAS YOUNG. I WILL AGAIN WATCHING IT FOR YEARS TO COME. ONE OF MY FAV SHOWS TO WATCH.
5,"Station 51, KMG Three Six Five","The good TV series are the ones that stand up over time. I think ""Emergency"" does this pretty well. Like many series, it ran a season or two over its useful life (after a while, they had done every kind of rescue, and the doctors had treated every kind of ailment). But this DVD, Season 2, finds the series hitting its stride. The characters interact very well, the stories are good -- just a solid action-drama, with some humor sprinkled in.One more thing: The alert tone that preceded the dispatcher's words was the greatest single sound effect in TV history. I use it for my cell phone ring tone."
3,"Good, but could be improved","I loved this show growing up, and it's great to see the episodes again.My problem with this is that the transfer would greatly benefit from a remastering, and the set has no extras to speak of.Still worth the price, but don't go in expecting any frills."
3,This show got me interested in Medicine,I remember this show very well as a kid I wanted to become a doctor. However that didn't happen. But I still enjoyed the shows.
5,THE BEST MEDICAL SHOW IN HISTORY,"NO OTHER MEDICAL SHOWS COMPARE TO THIS ONE. THIS IS THE TOPS. I HATE ER, QUINCY M.D,DOOGEY HOWSER M.D AND TRAPPER JOHN COMES IN SECOND PLACE AS ANOTHER FAVORITE. BUT NOT WORTH SPENDING THE MONEY FOR AS EMERGENCY. YOU CANT BEAT THE BOND THAT JOHNNY GAGE AND ROY DESOTO HAVE TOGETHER AS PARTNERS. IN FUTURE SEASONS YOU WILL SEE JOHNNY GAGE WITH A MUSTACHE AND GOTEE. I REMEMBER SEEING PARTS OF THE FIRST 3 SEASONS THAN AFTER THAT I WATCHED EVERY EPISODE UNTIL IT ENDED. SO IT'S A TREAT TO GET TO SEE THE FIRST 2 SEASONS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND 3 WHEN IT COMES OUT. JUST TOO BAD THERE WAS NO LOVE SCENES BACK THAN WERE TIME WAS INNOCENT. LIKE IN TRAPPER JOHN M.D THERE WAS A LOVE SCENE BETWEEN PERNELL ROBERTS AND A WOMAN AS THE SAME TIME AS GREGORY HARRISON HAD WITH A WOMAN. THAT SCENE WAS HOT."
5,Emergency S2,"Bought for my mum and she loves it as much today as she did when it was first released, even i enjoyed it and i am only in my 20's"
5,Emergency Second Season,Love The new DVD's They are great. Both my husband and I watched this serires when were kids and were excited to get them in such good quality. We can wait for the rest of the series to come out.
5,Great Paramedic duo on the job!!,I bought season one for my husband for Christmas and just got season two. My six year old daughter loves watching the firefighting/parmedic duo with her daddy. No blood and guts you can watch with the family.
5,Good T.V viewing,I liked the series when it first came out and still enjoy it today. The color and quality of season two is good. Received the product in 2 days.
3,Great Show! Bad Discs--Again,"5 stars for the show; 1 star for Universal's disc quality = 3 stars for this set.I loved this show when I watched it on a B&W; (my parents didn't get color until about 1980) TV as a 12 y/o. I still enjoy it today. It's proof that entertainment doesn't have to be profane and sexual to be thoroughly entertaining. It's amazing how far we've sunk in 30 year.Unfortunately, this set suffers from poor Universal DVD quality. I've yet to meet a Universal TV DVD set in which all of the discs worked properly. Two of my three discs show no visible defects, but hack up in the middle in most machines. Interestingly, only my laptop computer's DVD player can handle them. I've tried them in several others and they hack up in the same place. It's some sort of very tiny defect that is not visible to my 47 y/o presbyopic eyes."
4,Great for Audio Books and MP3 Lectures,"I've been looking for an MP3 player for some study materials I have on MP3. The problem is most MP3 players don't allow you to fast forward through a clip, or save your place in a clip when you shut down.The Creative Zen Nano does allow you to fast-forward and fast-reverse through a clip, you go into the menu and turn on the ""cue/review"" function. If you turn off the player in the middle of a clip, when you turn it on the next time, it starts playing where you left off. Sweet!"
3,nice but way fragile,"Great little player, although the menu is sometimes mildly frustrating. Thing is mine got dropped from waist height onto a concrete surface and despite being in its plastic case the LCD busted and the player is dead. That is a little to weak if you ask me but was probably just very unlucky. I'm going to replace it with the same but I guess I'll have to baby it a little more."
4,pretty good player,"Good player for what I wanted it for. It doesn't have any fancy features, and it's a bit hard to scroll through songs to find what you want; but overall I'm satisfied with the player. The software is another story. It constantly stops responding and frequently locks up the entire computer. I don't know if I just got a bad copy or what but I'm extremely unhappy with it. Using the creative labs software makes something that should be simple, very time consuming and difficult."
2,Not as described,"This mp3 player died after 6 months of use, I bought it as a gift for my sister's birthday. Good value for price at the time. I'd suggest a ipod."
3,No armband and radio is locked,Mp3s play well; can fit plenty on it. There was no armband and protective case (as advertised). Radio funtion not useable; is locked out. Customer support wasn't helpful on this one.
3,partially satisfied,"While the mp3 player is the perfect size and the sound quality is very good, I was disappointed that it only holds around 200 songs - not the 500 it claims. Also, unless you buy the plus version from the products website, you don't get all the accessories and have to buy them separately."
4,nice compact player,"I use my Zen Nano 1GB player for audible books and have stored over 60 hours of books on it and still had plenty of memory left. The only complaint I have is the battery compartment cover, the catch can be easily broken if you don't use care removing it."
3,Very good,"I think among all the movies made about the underground leftist political groups in the 70's, this is probably the best. It is well balanced and unlike most of the movies in this genre (some of which were made by famous directors such as Bertolucci and Frankenheimer), it is not one-sided, journalistic, and ideological. Without romanticizing this kind of political idealism, the movie is sympethatic to the main characters and shows the tragedic consequences of their actions, despite their good intentions. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested in movies about leftist ""terrorism"" in the 60's and 70's."
2,How many times can you hear the same songs,Okay the original was awesome.. and now a 2 CD remix. Thought it would be great to experience these in new ways. Well after the original there is nothing improved upon for those of us who like Jazzanova. One CD would have been nice.. but 2 is too much.
4,EERIE & ATMOSPHERIC,"Ghost Sonata is a peculiar symphony of, inter alia, violin, woodwind, classical strings, cascades of electronics, piano, tape loops and snatches of vocals fed through a vocoder. Eerie in places, jazzy in others, their songs? never fail to amaze for ingenuity. The Sonata is held together by bits of dialogue from what seems to be a film soundtrack. Beside the atmospheric, orchestral Music Number Two, other interesting pieces include The Funeral Of A Friend, An Affair At The Soiree, Licorice Stick Ostinato and Les Odalisques. But The Sonata should really be appreciated as one movement. Try it for something vastly different if you have an intrepid ear."
3,Wrap Your Body,"I love listening to One-Way's album ""Wrap Your Body"", especially the song, ""More Than Friends, But Less Than Lovers"", however, I have yet to see the album on CD. If someone knows where I can find that on CD {besides ebay} let me know. Until then, I still play my albums."
2,Well written but the title is misleading.,"I liked the book for what it did cover but, when the title includes ""ATM, IP, Frame Relay, and SMDS explained"" I expected the authors to give more than a 50,000 foot overview. The book fell horribly short of the mark especially with respect to IP. IP wasn't even mentioned more than six times in the whole text. If you are looking for an overview of networking technologies this book is ""ok"" but , if you are looking for a book that explains the technoligies listed in the title this is not it!"
3,Any Info On WAE & ATM Here?,"Nice & basic, but needs to expand on WAE as it relates to ATM. The evolution of the net will use hodge-podge connections, but there is little doubt that consumers are pushing for ""roving"" wireless net connections -- which I think will still use ATM @ some ""point"". The question is, is that ATM point going to grow as a result of consumer mobility? Anyone know of another book (or info) on how to view this from a different viewpoint?"
5,An Open-Minded Ben,"...this album is such an amazing journey through stories of death and love and the mind...i had a promo copy and it hasn't left my CD player since...i IMMEDIATELY put it on my iPod and i've been letting all of my friends in on the action...they've all loved it...i've been hearing that some fans are nothing but disappointed by ""Plans""...saying that it's ""too mainstream""...but that couldn't be less true...this is still very true to Death Cab...i couldn't be more pleased...Ben is and always will be viewed as one of the greatest vocalist/songwriters of our time...his voice is just so comfortable...and along with Walla and the others, he's created yet another masterpiece...BUY THIS ALBUM...it's amazing..."
4,Not as good as the previous effort,"This feels like a blend of Transatlanticism and Give Up (Postal Service) to me. While you might think that the combination could possibly HURT an album, it actually does.Trying to combine the rock of Transatlanticism with the mellow vibe of Give Up just ends up confusing the listener. Yes, the lyrics are still solid as ever - but the songs seem to want to get moving, but never seem to go anywhere.There are a few bright spots on the album, where the band doesn't feel bogged down and tired - I Will Follow You into the Dark, Crooked Teeth, and the excellent Soul Meets Body are all great songs.The album is still decent, but does not grab you and make you WANT to listen to it the way the previous album did. All in all, I would recommend this to DCFC fans and recommend Transatanticism to music fans that may have not heard the band yet."
5,love,Was really happy to see this offered as a free download. Death cab is a great band to chill out and listen too
4,sellouts?!,"all you boys and girls that call death cab sellouts are the same little bastards that made them ""that"" way.so quit your bitching and go watch the O.C."
3,Good,"Good album, with only a little more than a few shortcomings (but we can't expect perfection from ANY artist)."
3,Very mediocre for such a talented band.,"To say that this record is a progression from ""Transatlantacism"" is not only ridiclous, it's downright criminal! I'm not sure what Death Cab were thinking when they recorded this but it is a very big decline from their previous record. Because it is Death Cab For Cutie, I will not hate it and I have purchased it but from another songwriter/performer's view, this is EXTREMELY mediocre.I could only really enjoy the song ""What Sarah Said"". The piano intro is very delicate and sweeps through the majority of the song, altering at some points. Ben's voice is very high in some parts which for me, reminisces the layout and beauty of ""Transatlantacism"".My overall thoughts: Ben should give Death Cab a break and team up with Jimmy Tamborello and give the many many Postal Service fans another dose of their highly infectious, melodic electronic indie."
3,England Dan and John Ford Cutie,"Finally a CD your mom will really love! Again the lyrics are excellent, but the lack of any tension and release really creates a disk that harkens back to those 70's male duo groups. Pray they don't cover ""Love is the Answer"" on the next one."
3,The Piano Album,"Like the White Stripes, DCFC has decided to do a piano album rather than a rock album and us fans will patiently wait for them to get it out of their system. Love the title, love the cover art, seemed full of promise and then ... eh ... not *bad* ... but ... it feels a bit like walking uphill. And, so we're clear, I'm loved Transalanticism and We Have the Facts and Postal Service, so I have no aversion to any particular Gibbard style. But I know the boys can do better than this."
3,plans,"okay, i'll be completely honest. i've loved death cab for years and years, and to my dismay, plans was a complete let down. yes, it has pretty songs, and nice lyrics, but to many ""long-time"" death cab fans, the cd just doesn't hit as hard. which isn't because they ""sold out."" songs such as ""marching bands of manhattan"" bring back the nostaligic feeling that death cab has always given me, but the repetitive slow songs and depressing lyrics on this album just become monotanous. good, but upsetting."
3,Not bad...,"I think Ned is being a tad harsh, but overall, this album is slightly disappointing from Death Cab, after the comparative brilliance of Transatlanticism. It is consistent and the tunes are uniformly catchy. I do agree with Aidin Vaziri's assertion in that there are perhaps one too many ballads. But there are some excellent tracks here, namely, ""I Will Follow You Into The Dark"" and ""Sarah's Song."" ""Soul Meets Body"" is also very catchy and seems the logical choice for first single. Overall, the album is good and probably one of their most accessible releases to date. I guess from Death Cab, I'd expect something more heart-grabbing, rather than just ""good."""
4,New to Death Cab,This is my first experience with Death Cab....it's a great CD. Perfect for taking on a road trip or listening to it on a walk or run.
5,This album is pure brilliance,"Death Cab has set the bar three times higher with this album, it is far and away their best work and in my opinion, an album almost anyone with any taste in music could fall in love with - impressive since it's not a mainstream pop album. That's pure brilliance."
3,"Good and consistent, but kind of boring","I've always liked these guys, but comparing this to the strength of their last couple albums, I think it comes up a little short. Some people may blame the major label on it but I think they've just made a kind of plain sounding album."
2,One Word. Yikes!,"Im so sick of hearing the constant, ""they were on the OC"" mumble jummble. This isnt about anything except music. DCFC seems bored. So bored they use the same damn sounding piano in almost every song. Its so formulaic it makes me sick. Aside from ""Different Names For The Same Thing"" (which really isnt that good either), The Album is such a stinker. But I feel as if I can let this one slide under the radar. Maybe try and forget it was ever released or maybe it never even happened. The bottom line here really is, If you are curious to hear what all the uproar is about. Dont listen to Plans. Go with one of the bands great albums they did before this catastrophe, Because listening to Plans will ruin the whole DCFC of old."
3,A relative disappointment for a great band...,This CD was a relative disappointment considering the previous work from Death Cab for Cutie.
3,"Okay, but...","as a long time fan of DCFC, I have to say it's no Something About Airplanes or We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes. Fans of ""new"" DCFC should check out one of these albums to learn that there was a life to this little band from Seattle before Plans or Transatlanticism."
5,Wow. And Wow again.,"So, I ended up with a promo copy a little early, but it has stood the test of time. I've been listening to this album pretty much daily for a week now, and it still holds up. It is a softer album than Transatlanticism, but I feel it is a stronger album. A little over-produced at moments, but it still is great. Haven't found a track worth skipping yet. I particularly enjoy the track programming on this disc. It takes you from place to place emotionally. It seems to be track groupings of two-three tracks with a similiar feel to them, but it all transitions nicely and is a great album to sit back and listen to after a long day of work."
3,what makes this cd pretty good?,"I like Death Cab a lot, they can be soothing and fun to listen to on long road trips, in coffee shops, etc. But then again, this CD can sound like this one long song being played over and over. There are only two different songs out of this whole CD. Don't get me wrong, I would choose Death Cab over Fall Out Boy any day (.. yes I'm comparing them to the unoriginality of Fall Out Boy) but then again this CD does not excite or get me going every day. I very much liked ""We've Got The Facts and We're Voting Yes"" etc. etc. but this CD lacks originality and does not stand out at all to me. But it doesn't bother me to listen to it from time to time. Songs like ""Your Heart Is An Empty Room"" and ""Brothers on A Hotel Bed"" have been added to my Mp3 player, but other than that, this CD isn't worth much."
3,not the greatest,It's alright. There are a few songs that really stick in your heads and a few evoke emotion but a lot of it seems too cheery for Death Cab. Also too polished. I liked Transatlanticism a lot more. Not a must have but if you can get it for...less...than full price you probably woulnd't regret it.
3,Disappointed.,"I've been a fan since Facts, and this is the first DCFC album that has really disappointed me. I understand that bands have to grow and evolve, but this albums is a real step backwards for them. I just don't dig how it's so mellow and lacking energy. Listen to Airplanes or Facts and you can see how real and inventive DCFC can be."
2,I don't get it.,"Each Death Cab release prior to this one had at least one song where the instruments were different (interesting) and the vocals were quite good. Transatlantacism had more of these than any other album by the band.This album has none. The lyrics, my favorite part, are mellow beyond excuse. Not a single song stands out.The closest thing I can compare this to is the new Coldplay album, where the lead single (Speed of Sound for Coldplay, Soul Meets Body for Death Cab) is the worst on the album.I will give credit for going against the mainstream, even when there is no innovation. However, this album refuses to do anything to budge out of solid mellow.Sorry Ben Gibbard, I think your voice is quite good."
1,Corporate....,I love DC4QT. Have been a fan for YEARS! I love when bands do there thing and do it well. I enjoy the fact that they make money and final one day get signed onto a major label. I hate the fact that the label makes them. They turn there music into junk. If you like DC4Qt then buy there older albums. Ones that don't include someguy in a fancy leather chair sayin .... no that is no good give me the pop crap. This album is horriable. I regrete buying it. But... buy there olders stuff!
2,"Honestly, not feeling it...","Death Cab For Cutie, although sometimes mislabled as emo, is really the anti-emo act of today. Their music isn't layered in screaming or breakdowns, and it doesn't follow any a-typical emo trends. If i had to describe cutie, it would be pure indie. For their newest ""plans"", cutie takes a slightly different direction, one more generic, and because of that, ""plans"" is probably the band's worst effort to date. Short, but not so sweet, this record really isn't worth a 12+ dollar purchase. If you're a diehard cutie fan, you probably own this record already, so i'm not preaching to you. If you're still on the fence, download a couple tracks first and make up your mind.Music: 2 starsLyrics: 3 starsProduction: 2 starsOverall: 2 stars"
1,I ate an umbrella,"Ok, so I bought this CD. Then, I threw a hamburger out my car window and it hits this kid on a mountain bike (I think it was a Huffy). The kid jumps off his bike and snarls, ""HEY! If you're gonna throw food at me, at least have the common courtesy to smile brightly).I smiled brightly. And I was happy to do so in quick/lightning fashion.Anyway, Plans is the kind of CD that you play when you're on a date with that emo girl from 2nd hour biology (she has a Modest Mouse hoodie and a Planes Mistaken For Stars pin on her skirt...that's emo right?) The date isn't going well and you're all like, ""If I'm gonna hold hands with this girl, I'll need to bust out this CD like an explosion of Uno cards.""You put on Plans. She thinks the album is called Plants. THERE IS A PROBLEM.QUICK! THROW ON KID A! RADIOHEAD IS A SAFE BET!The CD starts. EVERYTHIIIIIIING EVERYTHIIIIIIIIING.The girl swoons/chortles. She says, ""Come here and make out with me before my blog explodes.DEATH CAB! DEATH CAB!"
5,"Best CD since ""The Photo Album""","One of Death Cab's finest releases, definately worth getting your hands on a copy. This CD contains one of the best songs released so far, ""Marching Bands of Manhattan.""If you have not heard Death Cab for Cutie before, then THIS should be the first CD you buy. But be warned, you will fall in love with their music immediately and probably want to buy all the other albums straight away!"
4,Good but not great.,"I have become more and more familiar with Death Cab over the last few months with their successful song ""I will follow you into the dark"". The song has such a good sound to it that it was natural for me to invest in their cd. After playing the cd a couple of times I began to realize that most of their songs in this collection are good but not great. Death Cab has a consistent sound to their music. It's smooth and poetic. That is what really sets this cd forth into a very good complimation. Except if you are like me and are buying this cd mainly because of I will follow you don't expect any of the other songs to be on that caliber. Generally if you are looking for a decent cd with a smooth tone this is a good addition to any collection."
1,"Death Crap for Cutie, LOL!","If you've ever wondered what your friend's fat little brother would sound like if you gave him a record contract and a recording booth, this could be it. Take a look at lead singer Ben Gibbard and tell me he does not look like Corey Feldman from when he was in that movie Stand By Me. As for the actual music, they have better things than the ultimate sap song ""I Will Follow You Into The Dark"", which is apparently about some fat kids girlfriend becoming an hero. Oh and they never got any MTV airplay."
1,What a drag,"I am always looking for something different, as indie rock is usually a great place to start (when of course I am not in my mood to listen to death metal) After hearing many good things about Death Cab for Cutie being a great Indie band, I took a listen to this, and my god I almost fell asleep. These guys are a total drag, with almost no emotion to it. I have heard that the older stuff from these guys is much better, as some of the reviews have really been harsh to this album. This is the only one that I have to go on though, and not that I dont care for it, it just flat out sucks. Want some good Indie Rock try on Some Trans Am or check out some James Katz..Avoid this mess"
1,Sellouts! How Could They?,"It's clear that DCFC has sold out. How you say, because this is a major label debut and they are an indie-band and the two just don't mix (think oil and water).I really like this album, it's got a really neat sound throughout the entire album. I would recommend this to most anyone that likes pop/rock music."
4,I Like It,"I, like nearly every other teenager on earth, am a massive fan of The OC. That is of course where i heard about Deathcab.I heard the song ""A Lack of Colour"" and really liked it. I listened to Deathcab's album, Transatlaticism and i have to say i didn't really like it. It had some really good songs on it, but, to me, it just wasn't a consistently good album.I think this album is much more accessable to a wider audience. I am able to listen to this album all the way through without skipping a song and i think that is what a good album should be.My favourite song would have to be Soul Meets Body.I think this is a really good album and that moving to a major record label was a good decision for Deathcab. This, unlike transatlanticism, is a consistently good album."
3,2 catchy songs and the rest is well...,"Let's face it, these guys have 2 catchy songs...and the rest is just pretty much fluff. This music is best suited for some smokey coffee house in upstate NY. Although, after hearing them play live on Late Night With Connan Obrien, I'm beginning to wonder how they ever created a following at all! Their live performance on Connan was one of the worst I've heard in ages. It's a shame I stayed up late waiting to hear them.Overall though, the album is pretty good. It's easy to listen to. Perfect for driving through rolling meadows on warm summer days."
4,better than I thought...,"I liked this album better than I thought I would. I guess that's not a glowing recommendation, but I hadn't really taken this band seriously before. This is a good listen!"
5,A Wonderful Execution!,"Eumir Deodato had long been known for his elongatedjazz-fusion versions of popular movie themes.On 'Very Together' he turns his attention to short remakes of television themes-of them ""Peter Gun"" and ""Univac Loves You"" are given the funked up treatment.The Star Trek theme on the other hand is given a playful but slightly clished disco arrangent,the same one as his own ""Spanish Boogie"" in fact.But as with all Deodato albums this is based more in jazz-funk then disco-""Amani"",""Black Widow"",""Juanita"" and Bob Marley's ""I Shot The Sherrif"" all showcase infectious,steamy funk grooves that aim to please.Those songs alone make 'Very Together' an absolutely essencial part of Deodato's musical legacy!"
3,Deodato Shot The Sheriff (and his foot)...,"My only objection to this Millenuim Fusion Collection re-issue by MCA Victor/Universal Japan is the omission of the classic 2nd track ""Knights Of Freedom"" which was on the original vinyl release in 1976, and the track listing itself had been reshuffled. The 1979 release Knights Of Fantasy under Warner Bros. was really just a lack-lustre reworking of ""Knights Of Freedom"". This was also Deodato's final album released on MCA Records and then giving them the finger afterwards..."
5,Bad Brains.,"Nothing else needs to be said--and what can be said that hasn't been said already? This band took hardcore and made it somehow better. The reggae-type tracks are smooth and relaxing, whereas the harder and faster tracks blow you away, making you notice how ahead of their time that they were. The first good thing that Victory records has put out."
5,Cool Gift - You Look Great Giving It !!!,"Looking for a cool gift for someone special? Or maybe not so special, but you still need to preserve your reputation as a cutting-edge trend setter? Take it from someone that had no idea that pasta was so... so... well I had no idea that there was anything different than what I find in the supermarket isle.Hey, with all the cooking shows and competitions on TV, strut your top-chef stuff and just smile when you are complimented on your great taste in gift-giving."
5,A Fantastic Book!,"As a hobby illustrator and a great admirer of Children's Illustration books, this book has provided a generous overview of the world of picture book publishing. Whilst, no area is covered in great depth, it's simplicity and wonderful illustrations provided more than enough information for the interested reader.To self induluge, I would have loved to have seen some Australian illustrators mentioned though such as Mem Fox, Shaun Tan and Graeme Base as they are considered wonderful Picture Book Illustrators.I showed this book to some of my collegues and they loved it!"
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this album thinking it was a greatest hits compilation of Tim's Verve years. Instead, this seems to be a compilation of demo tapes. The audio quality isn't bad, but most of the cuts are a minute and a half long or so. Many have either very spare instrumention or odd ones, like string sections. Tim sounds fine, but if you're looking for the familiar versions of stuff on Tim Hardin 1-3 or so, forget it. This aint it."
2,Some rather notable discrepancies,"This was a cute story, but there seemed to be a lot of inconsistencies with the plot. Okay, to be honest, there were some pretty sizable plot holes, particularly when it came to the fire... and I have to admit that I did let those things distract me a bit, and take away from the story. Otherwise it was a fun story, with some interesting (if occasionally annoying) characters. I also thought the author overdid the foreshadowing just a tad... It's not what I would classify as a mystery, really, but more of a lightly humorous suspense novel. It had some good moments, but all in all, not a book I would strongly recommend unless you read a lot and are looking for a bit of fluff."
4,Fast-Paced,"I purchased this book at a convenience store in Newark airport out of desperation. I finished it before my flight landed in Portland. Don't expect anything deep or profound. However, I did thoroughly enjoy reading this book. It was extremely fast-paced. I found it to be both interesting and enjoyable. This isn't ordinarily something I'd pick up, but I would highly recommend it to someone traveling. Helps the time pass more quickly."
3,AVERAGE READ,It wasn't one of Carol Higgins Clark's best. Enjoyable more at the brginning. midway it got unbelievable & seemed like she was merely filling up pages until an ending was decided.
1,Terrible waste of time!,"I have never read this author before and have, frankly, steered away from her mother's books, believing they were hokey. Well, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. I guess I should have listed to my gut feelings....The plot of this book was implausible, and the characters were weak and boring. The ""detective"" doesn't really do much investigating but everything miraculously seems to fall into place.The saving graces of this book were that it was inexpensive and didn't take long to read. One more donation for the local library!"
1,HOKEY! WASTE OF TIME,Implausible volume filled with hokey characters. It read like a bad TV show. The only saving grace was that is was a quick read and thus didn't waste too much of my time.
2,Ernestine: Peak Experiences (Lily Tomlin),"Buy Lily's CD, called Lily Tomlin- This is a Recording...instead of this vcr tape of Peak Exp. The other CD is much better, than this vcr version! Peak Experiences is very short/poor quality & does not do justice to the great Ernestine."
3,works good,works as good as the originals if your machine came with them. if you machine didn't come with them and you made changes then they are life savers
5,Love it!,"I love the Mega Stress formula. It has extra B vitamins that I need. It has helped with my Carpal Tunnel tremendously.A friend of mine recommended taking high doses of vit. B for it, and well, she was absolutely right. Give this time thoughto help. It may take a bottle or 2, but you will notice that you are much better. Also, since vit. B tends to only stay in yourbody about 2 hours, the time release is the way to go."
1,"beautiful illustrations, poor message","This is a beautifully illustrated book that catches my child's eye and is a pleasure to look at. It is unfortunate that the message of this story seems to be that it is alright to compare yourself to others and envy them if they are more beautiful. It also suggests that if you are plain you should be sad. The solution found in this book was to become beautiful/colorful (from a plain caterpillar to a beautiful butterfly)and then, since you are now more beautiful then everyone you can be happy. Not exactly the message I'd like to instill in my child. Nothing about inner worth - only surface beauty. We still look at the pictures, but I change the story. If the book is still around when my child is old enough to realize my discrepancy from the narrative then we will discuss the problems with the ideas represented in the actual story."
2,"Not a total dud, but it won't have you drunk with passion.","Alex Reese may have finesse, but it is not with finesse alone that great albums are made. A little, sure, but too much gives way to a slick product instead of a crafty undertaking. Reese has his moments, though. ""Acid Lab"" is a terrific number, with spy movie-like keyboards and a jumping back rythm. But ""Candle"" comes off like stale elevator music, as does ""Jazz Master"" and ""Ibiza."" Reese's all-too-careful approach to the drum & bass genre results in mockery and simple boredom. Reese is what Kenny G. is for jazz: safe listening. The only danger you may encounter is scratching the disc while putting it back in its case, which may be a good thing. But some may prefer such a lifestyle, so I'll give it two stars for accessibility."
1,DREADFULLY REPETITIVE,"Who are you guys rating this cd a 4? I am very unpleased with my copy of Alex Reece. I thought the cuts sounded alright...but thats as good as it ever gets. Most of the songs are 6-7 minutes long with the same riff in cycle for most of that duration.I'm one who can listen to cd's while I'm working and it makes a cd easier to listen to until you get used to it. Not so with Mr. Alex Reece's cd. I found listening to this cd while doing my chores make doing my chores seem to take longer. This sounds like old megaman gaming music. It's actually that bad. For everyone still wondering, I HATE THIS CD!"
2,Get what you pay for...,"Great price, but you get what you pay for. These sheets were very soft until I washed them (followed manufacturer's instructions). With each wash, the pile becomes more uncomfortable to sleep on, plus they shrink considerably."
5,Very nice mugs,I really think these are just a delight. So pretty . In the set I ordered a couple of years ago I got 2 of the same color ? I just started to get some 'rust' staining in these after daily use . But love the feel and the weight . Not one has broken [one was lost lol] and being handicaped with bad motor skills that is saying something for a light weight mug. Large enough for my single brew Kuerig make too ! Not to many mugs that are as nice as tea cups in my book .
5,Great Mug Set,This Lenox Butterfly Meadow Mug Set was purchased as a gift & was delivered as described & in excellent condition.I would recommend this mug set to anyone.
4,PCM or DSD?,"I own this recording and it is extremely fine...but I wonder if it is PCM or DSD; either way you can't go wrong. At times Maestro Mehta seems to not be quite in sync with the soloist, but they always come together sooner or later. Still, I highly recommend the disc."
2,Stick with Stabila,"I purchased these levels from Amazon.com. The main problem was the longer level had a 3/16"" crown in the center of it! I called Irwin and their technician said to return to Amazon and have them send me another one. Well I sent it back and ordered STABILA's set which is perfect. Also the levels vials are adjustable which STABILA's are not. I'd prefer not to have to adjust vials when I need to be hanging doors. I've used other Irwin products and like them that's why I tried their levels, even though all my past levels have been STABILA. Stick with STABILA!!!!"
1,Don't get this unless you are stuck buying only this.,"This only gets one star, at best.Book starts in the middle of nowhere and wanders all over the place. It's like trying to paint a house following a fly from room to room with a roller and a can of paint.The publisher does a better job selling, and over-selling, the book and supplies than supporting (much less explaining) the CDs and Videos that can be purchased.If you can find a simplier book, get it. This will work, but you'll have to wade through small print, ""cute"" articles, and silly exercises to get to the meat of the matter - learning Spanish.I had to buy this for a continuing education class, but I have an old set of books and LPs that I really learned from to pass the course.Any language course that ""sells"" you on learning ""with your computer"" was probably designed by people who think the computers on Star Trek really talked...."
2,Illustrations vague and confusing; hard to follow exercises.,Frequently introduces new vocabulary in exercises without translating them. Awkward.
4,"Nice block set, but it didn't have 75 pieces","My 2 1/2 years old son loves his new blocks. So do I. The colors are bright. They are very well made. The cars and the train are very cute. It's a perfect toy for his age. The only problem was that the container says 75 pieces, and ours had 70.K. Lawson, California"
3,"Skip the movie, get the soundtrack!","Like many of Coppola's movies, Cotton Club is great to look at and listen to, but the storytelling falls flat and lacks coherency.If you're going to watch it, watch it for the musical numbers and don't set your expectations too high for anything more, or skip the DVD and just get the STUNNING soundtrack."
5,the birth of the american dream,"The dawn of the 20th century told through the eyes of youth on the fringe of the Dutch Schultz mob, a beautiful view of violent times. Artistic cinamatograpy, dazeling dance scenes, chronicals the loss of innocence as new york enters the new (20th) century. A terriffic film."
4,"Great, But Lacking Something","I think this film is very good, but it is lacking something. It takes place in the late 1920's and early 1930's (Right before the great depression.) Richard Gere plays a mafia boss, but at the same time doesn't act like one (I Know it's confusing.) It has great music, and shows actors acting as famous stars, such as Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington and Charley Louisiana. In addition to great music, Gregory Hines and his brother play tap dancers for the Cotton Club.The DVD is really good, and has the normal theartical trailer and a French and Spanish language substitute. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes mob movies or whoever likes a film with good music."
4,Welcome to the most famous Harlem' s nightclub!,"The creative energies of Coppola were still sparkling. This movie is a heartfelt tribute to an Age that just lives in the memory of a whole generation, that were teenagers after the WW2 and grew and grew up under the magic spell of Dizzy Gillespie, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk, Miles Davis, Django Reinhardt, Errol Garner and a countless list of big names of the Jazz.Obviously, Coppola remarks once more the hidden codes of the myth through the presence of the duality, expressed through the story of two brothers; one white the other black, and a fabulous interweaved connection of secondary plots.To my mind this is one of the best achievement of Coppola in the genre of chamber works of his notable career. Gregory Hines made the greatest role of his lifetime. Watch for that Goddess called Diane Ladd in her 19."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I found this overlong film to be somewhat of a disappointment for a director of Coppola's caliber. Sure it's visually dazzling, filled with great oldies hits, and offers charismatic (though never quite credible) performances which all add up to a generally enteraining pic. However the script is what's sorely stopping it from being the powerful gangster epic it might have been. The story is filled with stereotypes and inconsistencies in character development and interaction. Nice try Frank, but this looks more like a heavy-handed DICK TRACY entry than THE GODFATHER saga."
3,Before the times.,"I'm 34 years young. I remember watching this movie at my uncle's house as a kid. This film was definitely ahead of it's time, considering all of the talented actors at a very young age."
4,Great movie but where are the deleted scenes?,"It's great to finally have this movie on video in the widescreen format. However, I am disappointed that the deleted scenes which were advertised here and on MGM's official website are not on this DVD. It would have been nice to view them but I guess MGM decided not to release them at the last minute (perhaps a special edition DVD is in the works in the near future) or Coppola didn't allow MGM to release them. Perhaps he's planning to extend this film like he did with Apocalypse Now. Anyway, despite the missing deleted scenes, it's great to see this film again in its original aspect ratio with the theatrical trailer which ironically has brief moments of scenes that were deleted from the film."
5,wish i could have been to one of those shows!,"za za za zoom! the music, the cast and the dancing... gregory hines is absolutely un-hooked in this film. his unbearably cool tap solo centerpiece is filmed so well it is simply stupendous. it is spliced with the gangsters violence and the contrast between the art and destruction is astounding.this movie is bliss if you love jazz, dance and great cinematography.what a superior treat!"
5,the cotton club-a great movie,"the cotton club is a great movie. part gangster, part musical, part comedy, part drama, something for everyone! highly recommended for all who like to be entertained. sixties aficiandos will remember fred gywnne from the old comedy show, ""the munsters"" now cast as a big scary gangster in owney madden's irish mob. richard gere and gregory hines give stellar performances, and boy can mr gere blow that horn! lol the dancing girls will knock your socks off, and the story line is very realistic. tradgedy mixed with comedy, sort of like life itself. don't want to spoil the ending/plot, but i must confess i was a little envious of dixie dwyer and his flapper girl riding off into the sunset on the love train. lol, enjoy it over and over again. peace."
3,"Good, but incomplete","A good overview of SMS from the protocol side--but seems to miss handset integration. If your question was ""how does the handset receive an out of band message?"" you wouldn't find it here."
3,"Nice, but quirky guy","Rick Steves is a quirky guy who likes to get off the beaten path. This DVD is just like that, but I am making my first trip to Austria, and I felt this glossed over what it is like to go for your first time. He did not reveal all of the places that are listed in most guide books, and that disappointed me. What I like in his books are the little hints about visiting the things that you must see as a first time tourist. What I was disappointed in with this DVD is I felt that he skipped over some main attractions to show more of the ""out of the ordinary"" and ""off the beaten path"" places."
4,A look into Tibet,"The place is Tibet, just as it was being opened up by ""civilization"". The story is about a Lama who is reincarnated so that he will have a vigorus young body when those who would destroy Tibet arrive. But he is reincarnated into a very unexpected body, the child of white foreigners. It was an interesting book, but a bit on the short side. I wish there was a paperback version, but oh well.If you are not in the least interested in Tibetan culture and religious beliefs then stay way from this one. However if you are interested you will probably enjoy this. Just keep this in mind, this book is pretty graphic. It shows several death scenes and a woman giving birth. I'm a big fan of graphic novels and I was very happy with this book. All in all an nice start into what is hopefully a great series."
2,Only one or two songs I liked,This wouldn't be an album I would listen to frequently and I never play right through. Definitely an acquired taste.
3,POST-PUNK in the 00's.,"Another band taking aim at the post-punk/new wave revival. Granted, the base lines are excellent, the guitars sound like rehashed Daniel Ash, the lyrics are kinda...silly. Sorry, but it's true. I can't say that this album is bad...but it's not great. Just ok. For fans of THE FAINT, INTERPOL, and YEAH YEAH YEAH'S."
4,Moving in a Different Direction,"I picked up this album after I heard that they were coming to Des Moines to open up for one of my all time favorite bands, Nine Inch Nails. I figured, hey, Trent has a good ear for musical talent, after finding great talent out there like Manson, Prick, and Pig, so how could he go wrong with Moving Units? What an unusual pick, if you ask me. This band seems like a new wave ska band that was somehow transported to the present time from the eighties. Not that that is a bad thing. They have really catchy hooks, and after a couple of listening, they really grow on you. Not my favorite band by far, but definately not a bad one either. Spectacular tracks on the album include ""Anyone and Scabs"". Give it a listen. They just might grow on you."
2,yeah yeah!...(no.),"With a vocal delivery full to the bursting point with ""ah ah ah""s (recalling none other than the Count from Sesame Street), overly busy basslines, and overt influences-du-jour, this album drags and disappoints. Too bad, ""Between Us and Them"" is a catchy tune -- it might even snare you into buying this CD like it did me. It will gather dust on your shelf."
4,a swell cookbook,It's a swell AMERICAN cookbook that predates Nouvelle Cuisine and aniticipates locivor and organic trends. I ate there eons ago.M BURKE
5,Awesome starting point,"I can't tell you how many times I've found myself stuck trying to find that elusive ""perfect font"" and have gone back to this book and found what I was looking for nearly immediately. The author's method of breaking down the type styles by sections is genius and simple, and makes it easy for the reader to find exactly what they're looking for quickly. This little book has saved me countless hours! Would definitely recommend this book to all artists dealing with text!"
4,Type Style Finder: The Busy Designer's Guide to Type,"A fine collection of examples of combinations of types, styles and colors for all graphic designers."
4,For Serious Style Council Fans,"I completely reject what Jeff Bateman writes in his album description. I'm a Jam fan and well-versed in Paul Weller's solo work but the Style Council was Weller's strongest period because of the songwriting and overall musicianship of everyone involved. It takes a more sophisticated palate to appreciate, which may explain Bateman's derision. If you are a serious Style Council fan you should own this album. About a third of the tracks are sub-par, in my opinion, but the rest are good to very good. I collected most of these songs on vinyl and CD singles years ago and love having one disc with all of them."
4,A nice compilation.,This CD has some really choice tunes. I wish that the CD title track had not been omitted; A must have for SC fans.
4,Epic? Probably not....Worth every penny? Absolutely.,"Does every work need to be epic? I am afraid we expect too much too often. Just as one can appreciate an artist's studies and sketches, we too should appreciate this collection. It lets us a little deeper into what was TSC. Yes Mark Weller has moved on and looks back bitterly(for now) at TSC. No doubt he will transform again. When he does, we will most likely be in for more great lyrics and a genuine passion for his work. If you follow Weller, and not just the high points, buy this CD.Scott Paden, Architect"
3,"Product is ok, just cheap paper, but our AG hates it.","Our parrot couldn't care less about it. It just hangs there, in his cage, unmolested. Otherwise, I guess it's ok. Can't tell if your bird will like something unless you buy it and try it I guess."
2,bird doesn't like it,"My cockatiel just ignores it, have tried several times and left in cage for weeks but no luck. he likes other chew-type toys, this one just doesn't interest him."
3,Overpriced,This bird toy is smaller and not as colorful as I thought it would be. I would never pay this price if I saw it in a pet store.
2,Center of pan sticks up,"Nice griddle but the center is higher than the edges. No, I did not overheat it. So when you pour on eggs or something liquid, it runs out to the corners."
3,Not all it seems...,"This griddle was bought as replacement for another that was losing its non-stick coating. I was disappointed that this one was smaller. It is advertised as 10 1/4 inches, but this is OUTSIDE measurement. My old one is 10 1/4+ on the INSIDE. Inside measure is ~ 9 3/4 inches, a tight fit for 4 burgers, which the old one handled easily.The non-stick feature seems sturdy, and did 2 burgers with minimal clean-up.The griddle is 'handle-heavy'. When I put it on to heat before adding food, it wanted to tip toward the handle.I'll probably keep it, but I don't consider it a suitable replacement and haven't tossed the old one yet. It will handle light duty well. I've only used it a couple of times, but haven't noticed any warping. Sometimes if aluminum is cooled too quickly (thrust under cold water when very hot), it can warp. This one is light enough, this could easily happen."
5,Nonstick cookware,I am truly enjoying this pan and know it will be used for a very good time. Nothing sticks to it and that is what I wanted. It is very nice looking and durable and very easy to clean. I enjoy making my pancakes on this.
3,Not as described...,"I love this griddle, but was very disappointed to get it and find out that it does not match the description. This griddle does NOT have the thermospot in the center. I have relied heavily on the thermospots and specifically picked this over other griddles because of the thermospot."
2,Disappointment,"This is a first for Amazon not to deliver as advertised. The griddle displayed in the picture is not the griddle that I received, this was a gift for my wife as we have many other quality T-Fal products. I will keep this because it is such a hassle to return but it will be a long time before, maybe never will I buy again from Amazon, what a sad situation is such bad financial time.....Richard Alfrey"
1,purpose?,What was the point of even writing this book? It was just one very very very long epilogue to the series. Fern Micheals could have done it in 2 pages at the end of the last book.I really hated it. It was not tworth the time or the money. I kept waiting for something to happen but it just meanderd from one character to another without any interest.
4,One of my favorite authors!,Love Fern Michaels and Loved the entire Texas series. I only wish they would make these available on kindle.(anyone listening???)
5,TEXAS SUNRISE,"I JUST LOVED TEXAS SUNRISE, AND ALL THE TEXAS SERIES. I WAS VERY SORRY WHEN I READ THE LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES. FERN MICHAELS IS A MASTER STORY TELLER. I CANNOT WAIT TO READ THE KENTUCKY SERIES AND THE LAS VEGAS SERIES. THE SAME NAMES COME UP IN ALL THREE TRILOGY'S."
4,Good solo album,"This is a nice solo album from Weston's renaissance in the 1990s. I am a huge fan of his, especially the group projects (usually under the title African Rhythms). Weston is an utterly distinctive pianist, although I have to admit that a long solo ablum (from anyone) is a litte tough to get through. But there is certainly plenty of outstanding stuff here, with most of the compositions (as expected) by Weston, including some rarities. The blues numbers--one his great strengths--are memorable."
3,a disappointment... i expected more,"I was excited to find a collectors checklist for ponies but a little disapointed when it finally arrived in the mail. There are absolutely NO pictures, sketches, etc of any ponies whatsoever. The checklists seem a little incomplete and there isn't much of a description of each category listed.To be honest the disapointment is really my fault bc the book is exactly what the title is: nothing but a checklist-- i'm not sure how complete though-- but if your a MLP collector there are some websites with checklists you can print out and pictures of each pony and extreme detail to each one. I would recommend saving your money or trying another MLP collector's guide."
1,My Little Pony Collector's Inventory,"I was disappointed in this book. I needed a book that showed the inventory by name, description and picture. This book does not have that."
5,I'm not the only one!,"This book was like a ray of sunshine on a cloudy day. After reading the introduction alone, I felt a complete connection to the author. I, too, became obsessed with the little ponies from the moment Cotton Candy showed up in my stocking when I was three years old. It is such a joy to look at my 400+ pony collection and know that I'm not the only one. There are so many accessories that it can make a collector's head spin. I didn't find ebay until a few years ago, so I'm still learning about all the things I missed growing up. I can only imagine the love and dedication that went into this checklist. I wouldn't even know where to begin. I have found many checklists online from various websites, but none as comprehensive as Hillary's. I only hope that she will be able to put another book together for all of the random pony releases like the softies, clothing sets, puzzles, etc. But overall, this book has been a lifesaver. Thanks, and job well done!"
4,Collectors Inventory Guide A Must,The book is well organized from the 80's to the 90's has detailed explantions on the G1 accessories. It is easy to flip through quickly leaves space for you own notes on each entry. The type is a good size and easy to see pictures would have been nice and maybe that is in the works. Well done Hillary somebody had to do it!!!! A G1 collector
3,Pretty Good!,"This is a handy little book to have. It is absolutely aimed at advanced collectors, especially with the lack of pictures. And yes, you can get a lot of this info online for free. However, it is very nice to have a guide arranged as a checklist, so you can mark off what you have and carry it around with you!!I would be VERY, VERY interested in a version with pictures!! Some of the accessory descriptions are not all that helpful without photos.There are many collectors who really want to get EVERY LAST ACCESSORY, and we need a good guide. This is a pretty good attempt! If you're an experienced collector, I would recommed it."
3,No crisp crust,I was disappointed in this bag. I want a bag that will keep my bread-machine bread crust nice and crispy. A brown paper bag works great but I can't find the right size.
4,Works well,"This really does extend the life of bread. My only complaint is that the bread dries out and becomes hard. I suppose it the trade off for it not getting moldy so soon.A few people have complained about cleaning it, but I just turned it inside out, rinsed it, and left it inside out to dry. No problem."
5,Mr. Quintron and Miss Pussycat Rule the Underworld of Soul,"IF YOU HAVE NOT EVER HEARD QUINTRON AND MISS PUSSYCAT BUY THIS AND THEN BUY EVERYTHING ELSE THEY HAVE EVER DONE.If there is a leading light of modern organ music it is Quintron. Not only does he play the organ but he invented his own drum/noise machine, ""The Drum Buddy."" His music sounds like nothing else out there and yet it in all of it's forms is the most danceable noise around. If you like ""Wolf Eyes"", ""Bebe and Serge"", ""XBXRX"", or any modern ""Rock"" band you should check this out because who can't love a man playing organ and a woman with puppets."
3,Aiiiiight,"I don't love his albums like I love his shows. Quintron and miss pussycat play incredible shows. Probably the best duo I've seen since Pink & Brown broke up. But you can't have everything. Don't get me wrong, I love place unknown, cave formation, miniature breakdown.... as single songs. But the album as a whole, just doesn't come within miles of his live music."
2,Strictly for Vonnegut followers,"This book is only for people who have previously read and admire Vonnegut, because it's basically his memoirs in the way that a writer can do them, his speeches, letters, things that he has said, and this is a man that has said all he needed to, he once vowed to stop writing, though he retracted on that. Not a good startup for KV readers, and not even a must-have for fans, if you're a light fan and would like to read the man not the novelist, get, ""A Man Without a Country"" available on this site."
4,"Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. is an interesting fellow","Autobiographical collage of Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.'s life. Family tree, the firebombing of Dresden, children, friends (an expansive list of writer friends). Thoughts about authors, censorship. Infused with speeches, short stories, and a play. Fun to read."
1,Huh!,"I bought this book bc I read a Rolling Stone article about the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Flea said the writer Vonnegut was one of the influences that made him straighten up and see what was important in the world. Maybe I picked the wrong book, but this book is just random ramblings. I read almost half the book trying to give it a chance and I finally gave up. It was a complete waste of my time. NOTHING in the first half was worth the time to read. I mean it was literally just this man talking about WHATEVER, and I mean no moral to the story or taking a stand nothing. Very disappointed."
3,It is as it is promised,"This is simply ""An Autobiographical Collage"". A collection of Op-Ed pieces, speeches givin, short family tree and some things that had no where else to go. As a fan of Kurt, I own most of his books, and I had this one for 3 years before I read it because I wanted to read more of his fiction before I found out about the man. Some of the articles mention his past novels and it is helpful to have read them to get a true understanding of what he is talking about. It was refreshing to see that Kurt believes the worst book he ahs written is Slapstick, he gives it a D. I never liked that book, and now I feel like it is OK to not like it. All in all this is no more than a short attention span book that will fill 5 minutes here or there. If you have just a passing interest in Vonnegut, do not bother with this book. However if you are a big Vonnegut fan like me, you might want to pick this up and get a little insight into his warped mind.T"
3,Satisfying Read,"Enjoyed the different concept of the story and thought it laid the ground work for the balance of the series - definitely made you want to find out where it would all lead. A little difficult to wrap around my mind, but the author made you care about the charaters, and had some good mystery and suspense woven in. Overall it was a satisfying read and left you curious for more."
5,Read half the book and purchased the whole volume,Excellent book. I had to really pay attention and sometimes re-read a paragraph. But after I was about half way into the book It took off and I am hooked. I love this book I love the story line. My mind is spinning and amazed at how correct this may be to true life as we live today. And what may have happened in the pre-existence. I can't wait for the rest of the volumes to arrive. Thank you for writting this book. :)
5,Terrific.,Well written given it is a subject that is total speculation. Kept me turning the pages as fast as I could. Highly recommended to anyone.
2,Disturbingly graphic,"As far as Mormon fiction goes, the plot was great. We read the first 2 books in the series. There are parts where he gets into lots of gory details about how people are murdered. As we finished the second book, I realized that I was going to have to throw these books away after we read them, because I wouldn't want my kids to have those disturbing images in their minds. So we decided they weren't worth our time either. It's a shame that he ruined a great story with those disturbing descriptions"
2,Cheap rotary tool bit kit,Very cheap rotary tool bits. They flimsy and the come apart too easily when used.
5,A great review manual and reference book,"This book was my primary source when I was preparing for the CLA exam. Coherent, organized and thoughtful, it is a ""must buy"" for CLA candidates. Until my book was borrowed (and not returned) by another legal assistant, the manual served as a handy reference manual in my practice."
5,"It is a good reference, even if you don't take the CLA exam.","The manual does not teach to the test; however, the sections on ethics, grammar, punctuation, and composition are clear and concise. I am looking forward to reading the rest of it."
5,region coding,Just received it. For the benefit of non-US fans it is actually an all region 0 DVD and not the region 1 DVD in the Amazon description.
1,Please re-issue!!!!,"I am obviously a little late to the game, somehow I did not hear about this DVD back in '09 when it was released. Now it seems that there are only 2 copies on the ENTIRE INTERNET(!?) available for sale?And they are going for +$300?!?!?!?!?Please re-issue this! I can't even find somewhere to pirate a copy and I never do that kind of stuff; but honestly, I'm almost physically sick that I can't purchase this for a reasonable price.I would rather buy 10 copies, at $30 a piece, and give them out as amazing gifts than give one greedy jerk $300 for a DVD they obviously don't want anymore."
5,Van the Man from Amazon to yuo,Thanks for offering this product to all of us who actually couldn't get to the Hollywood Bowl concert. The next best thing to actually being there. The best thing is that you can view this over and over again in the comfort of your own home.
5,By God its Great!,Its Van Morrison.Its Real music.What a gift what a joy to listen to this.Update: So after listening to this literally hundreds of times over the past three years it is still a favorite. This is the single best set of music in one performance that I have ever listened to
3,Not Worth The Wait,"I'm a Van fan, OK. I have all his releases and most of the circulating bootlegs. I put his various tracks on audio DVDs and listen to them in random order all day. I even had a bumper sticker made that says ""Van Morrison-Anything Else Is Just Noise"". That said, I was disappointed in this DVD. To me it just doesn't give the impression of a true capture of the concert. Yes, the audio does it justice but the video leaves a lot to be desired in that it doesn't seem to match up the the audio. It's like the audio was recorded and edited and then tried to be matched up to the video. That's the best way I can explain it. Also, the quick cuts from one shot to the next are very irritating. I don't see myself returning to this many times. If you want a great Van DVD check out the Live at Montreux 1980 & 1974.Live at Montreux 1980 and 1974"
5,Not for Europe - what a great disappointment,"This DVD is only for sale with region 1 encoding.This means that all Mr. Morrison's fans outside USA/Canada will not have access to this unmissable piece of musical history.Amazon company, please, please, please, would you release the DVD encoded for Europe????"
2,much too easy,"I have been nearly completely bedridden for the last 8 years, and have been ill for 12. I am 60 years old and just starting to become well again, and my first thought for fitness was Pilates and abs. I also like supporting the breast cancer research, so I purchased this, thinking that anything would be a challenge for me.This wasn't. And if it doesn't challenge me, it won't challenge you. Get something else, breast cancer can be supported in useful ways, too"
1,Boooooooooring!!!!,"I think the only reason I purchased this product was to support the fight against breast cancer because I couldn't have intended to sweat. The little pink band that comes with it is worthless and kept slipping off my feet to the point of annoyance and the workout lasts maybe ten minutes. I thought this DVD would at least be good for making myself more flexible. Needless to say after the pilates craze, this ""workout"" fell short."
2,kind of disappointed,"I love Mari Winsor and her videos, but this one didn't do much for me. It didn't seem that intense and I wasn't feeling the burn at all. Maybe for a beginner this would be better. I think I will stick to her other workouts. Each exercise is pretty short, so by the time you get the hang of it, it's over. Good luck!"
2,My feet won't stay in band!,"This flimsy resistance band is for the birds. My little toe kept getting stuck in it. If the band isn't spread out AND you don't keep your feet separated at the toes (heels together) it HURTS because of the smushing feet together while pulling. I had to reposition constantly and no, I don't think it will get better over time. I want to exercise but not struggle with this thing. This would NOT be a workout for heavy set people as you would never get positioned to do anything. I sold this DVD back to Amazon.com. There are SO many better DVD's to exercise with that are fun and easier to do for the legs and thighs BUT this one is NOT it. Sorry.... I like most of Mari Winsor's other workouts, especially the older ones."
2,Not too intense,"The workout itself is okay... but it didn't do much for me.... After doing the core fusion videos, which is pretty intense, this video became useless. However, this may suit some beginners."
2,just blah,"the band was annoying and like everyone else said,it kept slipping off!The only good thing about this is some of my money went to fight breast cancer,but other than that I like mari's other dvd's wayy better."
2,Unimpressive,"I was hoping for a new Pilates workout program; this was just a re-hash of the Windsor Pilates tapes I already have with the addition of a stretch band. I found the stretch band cumbersome to use in the timeframe the DVD alloted for each routine. By the time I had everything in place, the routine was almost over. Overall I was not impressed, and thankful I didn't pay full price. I will continue to use my original tapes and this one will probably gather dust on the shelf."
4,Love this,This is very good Pilates workout. There are clear examples of every fitness level. Great! I know this one will be one of my favorites.
4,Good workout,"It's good to workout any places I can, but I have more learn and practice!For this band which I received, it seem shorter than in DVD I'm not sure. Anyway I still like it!"
2,Not really neroli..,"I was not impressed with the scent, as it did not smell like true orange blossoms. I will not purchase this product again."
5,A book that everyone should read!,"Reading this book has added new positive elements to my life, personally and financially. It encourages you to dig deep inside your inner self and find your true calling in life and to make positive changes, whether it's music, family, business, etc.. I've made my own positive changes in my business and nearly doubled my income thanks to the help of Mr. Famularos book. I HIGHLY recommend ""The Cycle of Self-Empowerment"" to everyone....."
5,damn...,"Holy cow, this is a great album. My mind was soaring after the first 6 seconds. Simon Shaheen on violin and Wayne Shorter are STUNNING. Thick, tight grooves, phat bass, all kinds of spacy sounds... THIS ONE'S GOOD! GET IT!"
4,LIKE ALL OF LASWELL PROJECTS YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN MINDED,"laswell's cool but I'm a p funk head and bootsy collins, and bernie worrell plays on herer and those 2 are kind of out there themselves and just as bizarre still it's a must have good cd for those who like the weird crazy sound opf jazz fusion and funk."
2,Dissapointing,"After all the rave reviews was expecting a bit more than this.I would rather go with any sphongle, OTT, Blutech etc than this."
1,Music for a hookah bar . . .,in the suburbs of Chicago. This album is my mom's idea of exotic and funky. Don't bother buying it.
5,Great examination of factors (mis)leading us into war,Norman Solomon is a thoughtful scholar and his powerful analysis makes clear the many factors which let government officials (mis)lead us into war. A must see! Also read the book:War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death
4,"An indepth assessment of ""The Congressional, Industrial Military Complex""",Thumbs-up for the efforts of those who risk everything to expose the facts behind the wasting of our military lives in un-necessary wars.
3,Common Spiders of the U.S.,"This is a fairly decent reference guide for the more scientific minded reader. The book is full of detailed sketches of spiders, their pieces and their parts.The book falls short, however, in its lack of color photos and its propensity for being altogether too technical. Most people only know spiders by their common names (ie. Black widow- Latrodectus Mactans), so figuring out what your looking at may be difficult while using this book. Saying that, I would recommend the text for spider enthusiasts."
2,Common Spiders of the United States,"This was a great book in 1902 - the first popular spider guide by someone who knew what he was talking about. Unfortunately, the publishers who reprinted the book never updated its contents. Dover editions contain exactly one page of new material - a ""key to families"" by an insect specialist (spiders are not insects) which is guaranteed to lead beginners wrong. Now, 100 years after Emerton wrote, essentially every spider species he discussed is known by a different name. The natural-history information, while largely correct, is also 100 years out of date. An arachnologist who already knows the current names of Emerton's spiders can still make use of his excellent drawings and photos, but an interested layperson will only be misled, and would be better off with something more current, such as Levi's ""Spiders and their Kin."" Incidentally, the reason there are no common names in the book is that 95% of spiders have none!"
4,"well built, chess pieces bit smaller than expected",The chess set is well built. the box locks tight and my daughter (6yrs) is able to handle it just fine. The magnets are ok for regular use.My only disappointment was that the pieces are much smaller than I thought it would be. The size isn't really apparent from the pictures at the amazon product page..
2,"Good set, puny magnets","Nice and compact when folded up and a good size when open. Nice looking and great for breaks at work. The only sore point is the weakness of the puny magnets. The magnets are too weak to hold if the board is bumped. They are just barely strong enough to keep the pieces in place during a car ride as well. It shouldn't be advertised as a ""magnetic"" set with sorry magnets like these."
4,Travel Magnetic Chess Set,"The board and pieces are very nice. The magnet is not quite as strong as I had hoped, but it is OK."
5,Unbelievably stirring song,This is probably the most beautifully painful song I have ever heard. It brings me to tears whenever I hear it.
3,In the House of Stone and Light,"I've enjoyed listening to this cd quite a bit, though it's a bit more sentimental than most music i listen to. Had i not had such great associations with the music from years past i might not have appreciated the sensitivity in the music. It is very pleasant to wake up to in the morning or relax with in the evening. It's not really midday music (for what that's worth)."
5,Best bargain in music history!,"This must be the gretest album in over-pressing history. I see it everywhere for $1.00 or less, and the amazing thing is this CD is FANTASTIC!"
3,Unrealistically Entertaining,"The book was a very quick, easy read and was quite entertaining, however, completely out-of-this-world unrealistic!! I know most types of these books are, however, this more so than most! I did have fun reading it, though in the end I was left dumbfounded by the unrealism. I did really enjoy the parts with Donald though; they made the book worthwhile!!"
4,Fun Summer Read,"If you want something light that's just plain fun, check this out. Lots of laughs and hilarious situations with a hint of Bridget Jones. For relationship dramas with more depth and emotion, definitely read Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin and The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks - my two all-time favorites."
1,"How much, Kelly?","I want to know how much the publisher paid Kelly Ripa to recommend this book? Predictable, not very well written and completely contrived with dialogue that is entirely uninspired. The characters had no depth. The writing was difficult to follow. References to the esoteric were over-used."
4,Very light read.,It took me only a couple of days to read this book. It completely pulled me in and I didn't want to stop reading till I find out what is going to happen and who she is going to end up with. I really liked it. Very easy and quick read. Quite relaxing too.
3,Unrealistically entertaining,"The book was well written and very entertaining, but it was definitely extremely unrealistic. I know these types of books usually are, but this one more so than usual. The end made me go ""huh?"" and ""yeah, right!"" I did enjoy the duck very much though!!!"
2,all over the place,"This book was a big disappointment. You spend the whole book waiting for the main characters to get back together, and you don't even really like them. If you're looking for a fun chic lit book, this is not it!"
3,Engaging novel with some flaws,"This book describes one of those love stories where everything keeps going wrong--the two main characters experience a series of miscommunications and mishaps that keeps them from getting together until the very end of the book. If that in and of itself wasn't frustrating enough, the storyline includes some pretty unrealistic twists: the female lead, Josie, is freshly separated from her husband and still grieving this loss while pursuing a new love; the male lead, Matt, is desperate to find Josie yet still becomes involved with another woman along the way; and Josie's cousin, supposedly having a perfect wedding, still begins having doubts when her ex-boyfriend shows up on her wedding day. Of course, everything works out in the end, and although you may feel frustrated by the impossibility of it all along the way, the ride is still fairly enjoyable."
2,Passable at best,"""For Better for Worse"" is a romantic ""comedy"" about Josie, separated from her husband and flying to New York to be bridesmaid at her cousin's wedding. On the flight she meets Matt and they hit it off and arrange to meet up again later that day. Sparks fly, but through a series of blunders and misadventures the two lose contact with one another. At the same time Josie's soon to be ex-husband is flying over from London to try to win her back, and her cousin is about to make a disastrous mistake...This is a quick and undemanding read. The plot has just enough twists to keep you interested - although you know where it is probably going to end up at times it is hard to see how it is going to get there. However the comedic part of it falls flat. It's just not funny and at times it's downright stupid. Also, the characters are all very one-dimensional. This means that you end up not really caring what happens to any of them.An okay read, but no more."
1,Terrible Book,"I recommend not wasting your money or your time with this book. It's formulaic and tries (unsuccessfully) to be funny by being very, very negative. The characters and the plot were irritating."
2,If you want to do something useful with your time....,"This book was HORRIBLE. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is becuase the ending was semi-entertaining and half believable. For Better, For Worse goes on and on and on, twisting itself into a knot of repetition, and the writing is very dry, it is hard to hold your interest. I had to skip to the end, and even then, I could pick up the story because it was so predictable! The couple meets, they find out that they are soul mates, but they are both getting married to different people, both cancle weddings, look for each other, then find each other after way too many pages WASTED explaining, and live happily ever after the end. If you want to do something productive with your time, go out and watch Serindipity, which practically has the same story, but MUCH BETTER WRITING."
1,YAWN YAWN YAWN,"IF I EVER READ ANOTHER BOOK THAT KELLY SUGGEST, I WILL NEED MY HEAD EXAMINED,.,, WHAT A DRAG THIS BOOK IS DON'T BUY, DON'T READ IT AND KELLY HOW ABOUT RETIRING, YOU ARE GOOD ON YOUR SOAP AND WITH REGIS BUT THE BOOK CLUB HAS GOT TO GO"
1,Horribe Horrible Horrible,"This book started out well. Seemed to be going along GREAT but then it just went . . . . splat!!! How in the world are we, the reader, supposed to believe that Josie and Matt love each other when they don't spend more than a few hours together????? Especially knowing that Matt did what he did with Holly??? Would have been more believable if Matt and Holly ended up together. Maybe Josie was right and she was doomed to always pick Mr. Wrong! After all didn't Matt technically stray even though he just heard that she, Josie, claimed to love him and supposedly he felt the same."
3,A cute but formulaic and uneven chick-lit novel,"A good summer fluff read that was light enough and not overly romantic or 'cutesy.' Didn't like it as well as other Carole Matthews' novels (I think ""With or Without You"" was a better story), but still held my attention for most of the book. Pacing is really uneven, though, and I found the main characters to be annoying as the book wore on. I would recommend taking this one out from the library before buying it for your collection."
2,Richard Russo did poultry better,"Once the whole ridiculous duck bit started dragging on, it occurred to me that she must have been trying to channel Richard Russo's guffaw out loud Straight Man. For fun and funny escapism, I strongly recommend Russo, and unless you are stuck on a desert island without a library, don't bother with For Better - for it was definitely Worse... I hung on till the bitter end, and was mystified by the life choices the author made for her characters."
3,"Funny, light hearted book","This was my first read of any of Carole Matthews work. I found it to be a quick read, light hearted and humorous."
2,Don't waste your money,"I had high hopes for this book only to be disappointed. The beginning of the story seemed promising but I found myself not caring too much for the characters, not to mention that many of the situations are not believable; especially when Damian tried to pull off bringing the duck packed in his bag through security at the airport. I can't even believe that he thought trying to reach down its throat would retrieve the ring! I don't think this story was well thought out."
3,"Cute, vacation reading. Fairly engaging but uneven.","This book started out promisingly. The writer is capable in this milieu and there were actually a few times I laughed out loud. There were also lots of times I was bored. The book puts itself forward as having lots of twists and turns and weird coincidences, but that component of the storytelling was overstated on the flap, and contrived to high heaven.It was a cute story, though, with some nice moments and pleasant characters. It's not anything special but you won't hate yourself either."
3,entertaining but the ending sucked,"I enjoyed reading this book for the most part. It was entertaining. However, the ending was just silly. As you're reading you're hoping for a similar ending but it was pulled off in a very cheesy manner. After what Matt did, I hoped for a completely different ending."
1,Dangerous Speculative Rubbish,"The historical speculation and complete disregard for truth make this fantasy dangerous to youthful viewers. I would not recommend for ages below 21, as this can only be watched with an educated discenrment capable of filtering inaccuracies and anti-Christian propagana."
1,Kiss my ass.....the big let down,"I would have to say that this album is indeed a let down.One ofthe biggest rock bands in history the past 30 years should havea much better line up on their one and only tribute album thanthis.Garth Brooks and Lenny Kravitz are bright spots on thealbum,but other than that,if this is the best tribute albumto kiss they can come up with,they shouldnt have made one atall."
2,Classic Kiss butchered,"This album, when it was originally planned, had alot of promise. There were alot of high quality bands that were rumored to be interested in paying tribute to the ""Gods of Thunder"". But, due to contractual difficulties, we were left with the steaming pile of you know what that is now Kiss My Ass. Apart from the outstanding version of ""Hard Luck Woman""(Garth Brooks);a funky but cool version of ""Deuce""(Lenny Kravitz);and a great job of ""Christine Sixteen"" by The Gin Blossoms this album is a real let down. The ""Monsters Of Rock"" deserve a better tribute."
2,COULD have been so great!,"Lenny Kravitz kicks this disc off with an amazing cover of Deuce. That was an amazing track. However, the rest of the tracks are far too experimental or performed by marginal artists. Honestly, I would have rather wiated 5 more years with the hopes of a double album featuring artists like STP, Megadeth, Metallica and the like. The Bosstones? How can you butcher a track like etroit Rock City? An instrumental version of Black Diamond? I know the title says ""regrooved"" but come on! There's a limit!Other good tracks are provided by Anthrax, Garth Brooks, and Toad the Wet Sprocket. Otherwise, this album is very disappointing to KISS fans."
4,What a Hoot!,"One night, I was sitting up watching the ""Tonight Show with Jay Leno."" Garth Brooks was on, being his usual insufferable self, and I almost flipped to another channel when, going out to a commercial, Leno said ""We'll be right back with Kiss!"" Whaaa? Sure enough, back from the break, Garth launched into ""Hard Luck Woman"" with the no-makeup Kissters backing him. What a hoot!So that was enough to get me in the store for this CD and in addition to the aforementioned ""Hard Luck Woman"" there are some rote remakes and radical rips on classic Kiss tunes. Kravitz's ""Deuce"" rocks, as does ""She"" by Anthrax. So do the Gin Blossoms with ""Christine Sixteen"" (does anyone remember the Gin Blossoms?). Maybe Toad the Wet Sprocket's sluggish version of ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" is a bad idea, though.If you're a Kiss fan, you gotta have this. Too."
2,"good concept, poor design","we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature - which worked a little too good. the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out, i'd hit it and knock it out of place, so i had to readjust it all over again. sometimes when we'd hit bumps, it would fall and become worthless. finally, my little girl's arms got long enough that she could reach it, and it ended up breaking."
4,Eddie Bauer Baby View Back-Seat Mirror,"I really do not understand why this product has so many bad reviews. My husband and I bought this mirror before our daughter arrived and have had it for almost a year now. I will admit that the mirror is a bit on the difficult side to install, but once we installed and tightened it, it stayed in place and has remained so until we removed it to reinstall it at another part of the backseat to accommodate our daughter's big girl seat. I have moved the mirror around several times while installed and it never came loose. It is such a relief to be able to see my daughter while driving (She is a troublemaker) and it is an actual mirror, unlike most made from cheap plastic. My only real complaint would be that the mirror de-threads a little too easily and is a pain to re-thread, hence the four star rating. I will be buying another one for my second daughter due OCT. I am guessing the bad instances are from user-error or something."
1,This SUCKS!,"Agree with other reviewers. This thing is flimsy, hard to install and needs to be readjusted just about every time you drive. HATE IT!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,"Can't give zero stars, eh?","I've had this thing for about 3 weeks now and haven't been able to use it. I managed to jimmy-rig the mirror to my car's backseat as the directions specified, but it's impossible to see it from my rearview mirror. The thing falls down even before I can get the car to move. Sounds like a great design, but I really wished I had read the reviews before purchasing. Great in theory, but just shoddy engineering."
4,Super sexy,"I bought this item to wear under my wedding gown and it is almost perfect. I have to tailor the back hooks a little lower because my dress is low cut in the back. I also bought a size smaller than I really am. I am normally a 34D so I bought a 32D so that I would have extra hold and tapering in of my waistline, and this torsolette does the trick. It is long enough in the front to provide some control for that troublesome tummy pouch. Overall a good product."
3,"Beautiful product, but doesn't fit quite right","Just as beautiful as the photo, and provides great support! I did take the advice of other reviewers, and bought a size down (normally a 34C, and I bought a 32C). It fit great in that sense. However, I am a bit on the petite side (5' 2"") and the bottom of the torsolette kind of juts out--wouldn't look good under my wedding gown. I am returning it, but do recommend it if you have a slightly longer torso. I wish they made a petite size!"
4,Love it!,"I really like this. I bought it to go under my wedding dress to give me a nice silhouette. It worked great! There was plenty of support (even for a DD like me), and it made me look so good in my dress! I ordered my usual size, and it fit perfectly. The back is definitely low enough to wear under a strapless dress.My issues with it are that when I sit down, the boning digs into my hips and thighs (I guess my torso just isn't quite long enough). Also, when I sit down, the boning bows out a little in certain places which can look really strange when you're wearing it under something.Overall, I really like it, and I wear it under dresses a lot."
5,Very supportive and true to size,"I haven't worn it yet for my wedding, but this is a lovely corset and very supportive. I wear a 34D and it fits well and really boosts the girls up. My only issue is that the back is pretty high, and my dress has a semi-low back. I was able to unhook the top few hooks and fold them under and it works, and is still supportive. I didn't have time to return it and find another option that is as pretty. the ivory matches my dress really well."
3,Painless Spelling (Painless Series),"This a good book for entry-level students. It contains some interesting information about the history of English language and great charts with common and unusual spellings. The numerous ""Brain ticklers"" exercises and drawings are a little overwhelming and maybe unnecessary."
4,very good,"it was a very good shopping, the book arrived on time, and exactly as it was on the description, so am glad of getting it"
3,Great at first,"I was in love with this pan when I first got it for all he reasons the others mention. Great weight and angle on the handle, cooks evenly and truly non stick. However, I question how long the reviewers have had their pans before rating it. I've had mine a little under two years, and it's barely any more non stick than my plain stainless steel pan. I've never used metal utensils on it and there are no visible scratches or flaking, it just doesn't work as well. I've put it in the dishwasher but it says it's dishwasher safe, and I have burned a few things on it at times, but don't feel it should damage the pan to this degree.I still liking Viking for stainless steel and other cookware which will last a lifetime, but it's just not worth shelling out $200 every two years for a non stick."
4,Why weren't this Juliana Haterfield?,"Just kidding. I really do like Juliana Hatfield though. This is not my favorite Justin Pearson band, but it's still pretty good. It's got more of a straight up hard-core vibe and less weirdo-laden content. My friends give it static because this band is now on Epitaph...but I don't really care about that. Alot of really solid bands are on Epitaph. The songs and riffs are tight, but it just seems to be missing something. Still, if you like holy molar/locust/crimson curse/swing kids/justin pearson....pick this one up."
4,Chaos is rock,"From the get-go this album is as loud, chaotic and frenzied as I had hoped and expected. The only knock that I have on this album is that it's not as experimental as I had hoped. With the variety of people involved in this project, I had thought that maybe there would be a bit more variety on the CD. After saying that, I don't want to give the impression that this CD is substandard, it's just not as good as I had hoped. Still, a really great CD. The vocals on it are really good and the music is very very good. There is a cover of the Stooges ""No Fun"" on the CD that is amazing! Definetly a great album full of the angst and chaos that I would expect from a gathering of musicians such as these. Get this CD, you won't regret it."
5,The Perfect Storm!! (sorry bad pun),"It's hard, it's hot and it's one of the biggest hits of the year so far.Make no mistake this upfront hard house stormer (excuse the pun again!!) is huge. Quite simply its hard house with trance like build-ups coupled with a sense of purpose not seen since Darudes' Sandstorm.The production is superb with excellent use of build-ups keeping you in anticipation of the next big moment when it kicks off. The track hits even harder in remix form with a massive bassline that you'll just love!!"
4,Did well hope it lasts...,I had one of these before it just suddenly stopped working...However I hope to not have the same experience with this one...
5,forever memories,"the product came in no time,i was very happy with it.it was in great condition and i would recomend it to anyone loking for this item at amozon thanks"
5,What I needed.,It was Exactly what i needed and of the capacity needed. Ordering was easy. Came in expected time frame. It came without any damage
5,perfect,using in my MC 900 and it works flawlessly. If only I could find a tool to allow my EX5 to read/write smart cards!
4,"""Democracy don't work that way......""","Tell it like it is Steve Earle!Yes, F the CC is a little over the top but you sure can't ignore it.Not his best but hell, you may as well admit it-everybody would like to be even half as talented as he is.My wife heard ""Condi,Condi"" and laughed through the whole song.I love to hear my wife laugh so it was a great CD as far as I'm concerned.Buy 2 so he'll keep making them."
2,A Disappointment,"He made this album hastily and it was dated the day it was released. The ""Condie"" rice song is horrible at best. I love his other albums, and think Trans. Blues is a classic. Do not start here if you are not a fan of Earle; even if you are be prepared to be disappointed."
5,The Great American Poet,"I have come to truly admire, and respect Steve Earle's musical, and poetic contribution to our society. I had the pleaseure of meeting him once at a local Nashivlle club, where he performed. I am a conservative, and disagree with about 99% of Steve's idealogies, but I am in total admiration of his thought process, passion, and conviction. More importantly, he supports the healthy exchanges of of different views on any subject matter. I expected to meet this ""angry man"", but was pleased to find out, what a gentle, kind man he was, and was willing to listen. I believe that we as a society, need to recognize Steve Earle's courage in expressing his thoughts in soing, and poetry. For that, he is our greatest poet today. By the CD, as usual, you won't be dissapointed."
3,the investigation starts now,"It's the first Steve Earle music I've ever bought. The music is OK, not really what I expected but OK. The message is loud and clear and I do mostly agree with the message but I'm sure I'm on some FBI list right now as an anti-Bush radical"
1,"Well, Crap ...","Well, crap - Now another artist I like, has forced me to stop listening to and buying his music. Why can't entertainers just shut up and entertain? We all know they are dumb as a sack of dirt and have no clue about MY LIFE or what affects my family. By being political, Earle alienates half of his buying customers - bad business. Se Ya,...."
2,Earle's music hijacked by his extreme left drivel,"OK, there are four songs that I find sonically, very appealing, on Earle's latest CD; the title song, Home To Houston, Warrior and Comin'Around. For me, these songs are enough to make this worth buying. Steve Earle and I, both 49 years of age, must have had the same record collection growing up; Neil Young, The Stones, Dylan and The Doors. Nobody cops their music better than Earle,adding his signature vocals and backed by one of the best bands around. So regardless of Earle's weak political drivel on this album, I still dig the sound of the songs."
1,The well ran dry,"I hear many folk singers where I live who use vocal acrobatics to mask poor songwriting. Well that's what Earle is doing these days only he's using his brand of pissed off politics. This album was rushed? Why? Because the world had to hear what he has to say before it could continue turning? I for one couldn't care less. What is it about recovering coke head rock stars that makes them think they know better than the rest of us how the world should be run? Reading his own book tells me he doesn't have a clue how to run his own life. Let's face it, his creativity has dried up and he's running on foul smelling fumes. Make some music again for God's sake."
1,PATHETIC,"Unbelieveable waste of talentthe man has gone crazygarbage like this does not despite what Earle thinks help the cause. This idiot should take a subtlety lesson from his hero Townes van Zandt. The closest thing to a political song Townes ever wrote was a haunting poignant story of the plight of the homeless called ""Marie"" Im sure that one song by Townes had more impact than all of Earle's juvenile rantings put together.politics aside musically this CD is trash"
2,He Ain't No Emmas Revolution,"Good songs, good songwriter but if you want to hear REAL Revolution Rauk you need to hear Emmas Revolution. They didn't just jump on the revolution/hate Bush bandwagon because it was suddenly cool - they've hated Bush for a long time. I will say that this album is extremely intelligent for a man with only an 8th grade education and for those who criticize his ""Condi Condi"" song - maybe he's being sincere? You don't know. He has been married about 20 times... maybe he thinks it's about time for another ""switch up""? And lets face it: Condi is hot. A little out of his league, but you can't blame a guy for tryin, can you?"
2,Just didn't get this album!,"I do not know why because I am 1) a huge Steve Earle fan and 2) anti-Bush but I really did not enjoy this Cd at all. I think the reason, for me at least, is that it was too overly tendentious. While Earle was focusing so heavily on promoting a message, the songs really lost a lot musically. Maybe with the election now over, he'll turn back to writing songs that are less political and more eenjoyable to listen in the mode of ""I Feel Alright"" or ""Transcendental Blues"""
1,More Kool-Aid,"I have been vascillating as to whether or not to buy this album. I am a long-time Earle fan, and have pushed his music onto many others. I am a genre-crossing music lover, and Earle's diversity has long been, for me, a barometer of all that was right about music. Then a hiccup. I was remarkably underwhelmed by Jerusalem. I have no problem with a person, musician or otherwise, expressing their political opinions. I do have a problem with a person with the seeming expectation that, because they believe ""X"", you should as well. And when that attitude is accompanied by a catchy tune, it moves beyond ""problem"" into down-right disgruntlement. God Bless Steve Earle and his ""right"" to prattle on, to rail against those on the right AND those in the middle. But don't expect us all to line up at the Kool-Aid stand, money in hand, repeating the mantra, Thank You Sir, May I Have Another!After hearing the new album once, I rushed out and bought.....an old Merle Haggard."
2,"The music is good, the lyrics insipid","Come on Steve, if you're going to make a statement, just do it. This rambles all over and says nothing. What is the point of Condi, Condi? Sure it's a catchy tune, but it could have been anyone, it's no political statement.Sounds like you were hanging around with a bunch of stoned friends bitching about politics and out of that rambling you wrote these songs. Stick to what you know or do some research and get below the surface. Angry vague ravings don't mean much."
2,What Happened,"I have been a big Steve Earle fan for many years. I understand the reviewer who said that he gets worse with each new release. Eventhough I think Jerusalem was worse I think both albums have the same problem. I don't mind the political message. Earle seems to have a lot to say even if you don't agree with him, it just seems that for all the rage and information that he is trying to get across the music suffers. Some of the material makes it difficult to discern much of a melody. Maybe instead of writing a couple of topical songs and cobbling together a few more in order to finish the CD prior to the election, he might be better served writing an op-ed column and collecting enough great material to make a whole album."
5,a true man of the people and ahead of the pack of...,"As heard this AM on Amy Goodman's Democracy Now! week-daily program on Pacifica Radio network and affiliates, from the near-scene of the Republicryptofascist assemblage in NYC, this guy is and has been a true man of the people and way ahead of the pack of C&W;/country-rock/country-folk/bluegrass/country-alt in his musical oeuvre (cf. oeuvre ( P ) Pronunciation Key (vr)n. pl. oeuvres (vr)1-A work of art.2-The sum of the lifework of an artist, writer, or composer.[French uvre, from Old French uevre, work, from Latin opera, from pl. of opus, work. See opus.]AND ALSOin his sophisticated socio-political thinking, simplifying the main themes to accessible knee-slapping toe-tapping entertaining rhythms and lyrics and good ole-boy-fashioned moosickal entertainment (Li'l Abner ""Ah hears the sound o a strange and bootiful moosick"" cf. ""The Short Life and Happy Times of the Shmoo"" by Al Capp)...enjoy and Peace Out (...)"
2,Preaching To The Converted,"It's no secret that Steve Earle's politics are of the far left. But after the mostly fine Jerusalem, this record sounds forced. The title track is prime late-period Earle, but songs like F The Fcc and Condi Condi could have been left off. Earle is vastly more effective as a story teller, as in Rich Man's War, where he can inhabit a character. Earle should be commended for continuing to exercise his right to free speach but in large part he's ""preaching to the choir"". His increasingly ""in your face"" approach has become more off putting than thought provoking at this stage. To get his message out Earle needs to look for some common ground that he can use to draw in the non-fan. He's in danger of becoming the mirror image to right wing blowhards like Rush Limbaugh. With Earle's talent and smarts, that would be a shame."
5,one of the most important cds this year,"republicans and ""bushwashed"" people will hate this cd. why? because this record tells you what they dont want you to hear-the truth. mr.earle does have an understanding of current events much better than a previous reviewer would like to admit.this cd has much more of rock edge to it than i thought it would.obviously mr. earle is using the sound to mirror his frustration at the moment. it works,very well for him in fact.but its not a record of just angry chords and tones,theres great melody at work here.i dare anyone not to walk away humming ""condi,condi"" after just one listen. a great cd from someone who is well informed,and probably better than most of us."
5,Steve Earle takes Bush/Cheney to task,"This is an outstanding CD from a very gutsy country singer. With a culture that is so right wing Steve Earle has the courage of strong man to stand up and say, ""this country is headed into the toilet and we better do something and soon.""This is a very strong political statement that is well articulated by Steve to the point that he stirs passion into the listener to get off his duff and at least vote to get Bush out of office.Steve is amazing. To be this confident about his beliefs in an industry of right wingers is to be admired. Go Steve. By the way, I'll be voting for Kerry and let's get more on this band wagon while we still have a middle class."
2,Average Earle At Best,"The people giving this cd 5 stars must be doing so on it's political message and not it's musical content. As a long time Earle fan I can honestly say that Steve doesn't break any new boundaries here, and as the Amazon review said this was obviously a rushed album. It has a few highpoints, but it's not a start to finish good effort. On the other hand, even bad Earle is as good as most anything else being released right now. If you're new to Steve this isn't the disc to pick up, try El Corazon, Jerusalem or Transcendental Blues. Hey Steve, next time spend a little more time on the record and get it right."
3,Haphazard,"There are some good tracks on here, but they seem to be EITHER lyrically significant OR musically listenable, but rarely both.Feels more like a ""previously unreleased tracks"" catch-all than a planned album."
1,Earle Has Gone Off The Deep End,"What kind of man would think that any sane American wants to hear his endless ranting and raving about world events. And that goes for all the other ""Self-Appointed"" Extreme Left-Wing Foreign Advisors in the music world. Earle's music and his mind have really gone off the deep end in the last few years. These songs all have catchy and shocking titles... but the music within contains absolutely no substance or soul."
1,"Please, people, look at what's going on","If I really wanted to know what Earle thought, I freakin' call and ask him, not pay him $10 to hear him sing his thoughts on politics. Oh, and I'm sure he'll be giving a majority of the profits he makes on this album to needy people anre charities. he's a typical Hollywood/music star: they love to tell people what to do with their money but they don't want to throw all theirs around. If I had half the money this dipsh*t had, I'd be so freakin' happy that a guy with a gun in my face couldn't get me to stop smiling. So, basically, Steve, SHUT UP AND SING! If you want to give your political opinions, go on FNC and do so."
1,This Album and Artist are Trash no-count Cimmies,"This CD was ""rushed to market"" all right and it whows in SPADES.This man is mainly a no-count dimwit,a cokehead and a jailbird FELON.He doan't want to do a day's honest work and I am ashamed to say I own two of his CD's before I wised up.Does he this think he will save the Demorats from defeat, NEVER.He may be well meaning but he is too stupid to know where reality really begins in this world. I think what he has left of his brain has been FRIED. Go lay down Steve and have you EVER VOTED? Are you really from Florida?"
2,"I listened to ""I feel alright"" & this is no ""I feel alright""","I am one who doesn't mind politics mixed with music as long as the music is good. See U2 (sunday Bloody sunday) or the Alarm ( A new South Wales), but I don't like it when it is bad music, see Springsteen (41 shots). This stuff is bad. I have been a fan of Steve Earle since guitar town came out in 87 and have purchased each release since with great anticipation.This one lacks the groove that is usually associated with his music. The songs seem like they are rushed and have little direction except that he wishes to bash the GOP.Save that for Chris Matthews or Nightline...Steve, give us another gem like Transcendental Blues or I feel alright."
3,Political Rants Obscure Some Excellent Songs and Great Music,"Steve Earle's band has never sounded tighter and more rocking than on much of this CD. The non-rant songs are excellent, particularly the Emmylou Harris duet Comin' Around, I Thought You Should Knew and -- best of all -- The Seeker. As for the rest, the second version of The Revolution Starts Now is better than the first, but why two? Only a stone could miss Steve's point the first time around. Home to Houston is fairly interesting as a take on war by a new kind of warrior, the contract private sector employee. I also kind of like Condi, Condi and since I think she has a sense of humor, suspect she might as well. The rest is -- alas -- drivel, fueled by Steve's intense objection to Bush and the war in Iraq. Anger sometimes makes for good art (see Steve's own version of Christmas in Washington, for example) but here half the CD is simply generic propaganda."
2,"Lyrically interesting, musically bombastic","No problem with the politics. With as many of Nashville's hacks up there with their flag guitars to boost their record sales, I don't mind Steve Earle tweaking us and giving us something to think about, to talk about. I am beginning to tire of the SOUND of his albums, however. They are little more than sonic sludge bombs. The oversaturated wall of sound just wears me out over the course of this and his previous couple of albums. I love to rock it out, but how about a dynamic break in the action once in a while? I got spoiled by seeing him with the Bluegrass Dukes a couple of months ago. Now THERE was some dynamic variety and tension, plus I was amazed to hear Steve's voice sound the best I have heard in years. On these big electric efforts, it is little more than a compressed, shredded growl anymore. That said, glad he is doing what he does, lyrically. Musically, I am losing some interest."
1,"Compared to his other material, a weak effort...","...and I'm not sure how much effort went into this disc. The political lyrics aside, it is not a strong effort musically. You can't take your art (or your fans) for granted and put out self-indulgent prattle like this... if it is good work the music will speak for itself. Frankly he can do better and this record doesn't diminish his other work... in fact his other work is such that he will eventually be recognized as one of American music's great voices. I'll give him a free pass on this one. He has to have something to sing and sell at the protest rallies. But if you are new to Steve Earle, start at Transcendental Blues or Train A Comin."
1,Buyer Beware,"I am a big Steve Earle fan. While his big hits are catchy and memorable, no song on this album qualifies. I have come to love Steve for his way of hiding an important life lesson within the tune, rather than beating a dead horse with militantly-liberal propaganda. This album contains far too much of the later and none of the former.Some of the tunes on the album are nice and just the same ole' Steve. However, I hesitate to call many of them music.While it pains me to give such a harsh review to a legend like Steve Earle, this is not a work of art. This reeks of propaganda."
2,I miss Steve,"This may be the least interesting cd I've ever bought. Whatever happened to ""New York City"",""Fearless Heart,""The Other Kind"",and many others that just me you want to hit replay and just say Steve ""Freakin"" Earle. Ditch the professor glasses, get off the Al Franken and Janeane Garofalo clueless soapbox, and tell us about the misfits and outcasts melodically like it used to be. We'll take you back. The two stars, by the way, are strictly for the appearance of Emmy."
1,Unfortunately boring,"I'm beginning to believe that Mr. Earle has gotten himself into a rut that he is not sure how to get out of. This insightful singer-songwriter seems to be pioneering no new ground for himself and, expecially if you've been a fan of his earlier albums, listerners will find the same themes raked over again and again. Strident advocates of a cause always run the danger of becoming pretentious or, and this can be just as bad for their agenda, so expected as to become boring - we've heard it all before and it was better the first few times around. I think Mr. Earle is far too sincere to be consciously pretentious but all artists can become too much of themselves in their presentations. Having said that, if you like his voice and arrangements, you will like this CD, even with all the familiarity. I'm probably undermarking this CD because of my disappointment as a fan - take a listen for yourself and see what you think but try before you buy to avoid your own disappointment."
3,Inaccurate information,"This book inaccurately names the place that is used for the February 2nd celebration each year as Gobbler's Hill when it is actually called Gobbler's KNOB. While this book is concise, more facts and information are available inThe Groundhog Day Book of Facts and Funwhich includes current day practices, ancient beginnings, jokes, crafts and recipes. I purchased both for my library and use the later."
5,Cute book!,This book was purchased for and given to a first-grade classroom for use on Groundhog Day. The students enjoyed it.
2,Grandpa Claims It Didn't Work,"Bought this for my grandfather who has bad arthritis in the knees. He said it didn't work. Then again, nothing does. Just passing along what he said."
4,The Real Deal,"May not like the smell if you put on too much, but this works. Of course it is temporary, but some relief, sometimes, is better than none. One thing to consider, if you are applying on you leg (or arm) wait a minute or two before putting on clothes. If not, you will have a ""sticky"" fight."
5,Great Stuff!,"Stopain was highly recommended to me by a friend, and I will be passing this info on to others.My husband gets alot of pain in his hips & thighs due to a deteriorating spine. This product in the roll-on application is so easy to apply without getting all over your hands. The product does what it says, giving relief of pain to a localized area, by using it regularly.And the price is right! Especially when I can order in quantity and save on Shipping too!"
4,Damn Fun,"Sure, it's not the original, but it is a lot of fun. There is a lot more material on this CD, though (the advantage of digital, hooray), and it's well sung. And it's great to get to hear the dialogue and reprises. Victor Garber and Bebe Neuwirth are great fun (his version of ""The Good Old Days"" is fantastic, and you know that whatever THIS Lola wants, she'll get!), along with the whole cast. If you don't already have a CD of the show, you might want to look at the original first, but if you are already a fan of Shoeless Joe, you'll love this recording."
3,"Pretty good, but very different from the original.","Having listened to both the 1955 original broadway cast album (Ray Walston/Gwen Verdon) and this 1994 version, I'd have to say that I prefer the original. This version is not very true to the original score. However, there are some interesting additions, especially the ""Trial"" track. If you get this version, make sure to also get the original."
5,A Total Blast!,"I saw the very first preview performance of this revival on Broadway, and with the exception of a couple minor technical glitches, it was a ball!! So much fun, the cast was all energy and enthusiasm. When Jarrod Emick burst on stage belting Goodbye Old Girl, it was apparent a major new talent had arrived. And he won a Tony!! Bebe Neuwirth was wonderful, though I could have done without the blonde wig they had her in (I suppose to get her as far removed from Lilith as possible). She wasn't Gwen Verdon but made her own sexy and funny Lola. Victor Garber was a hoot as Applegate. The ballplayers led by Dick Latessa powered the show, giving it palable energy from beggining to end. The entire cast was marvelous and fun. It was a great time in the theater. Sure they may have tinkered with the book a bit, but this was a case where the changes really worked.Saw the national company a couple years later in Washington, led by Jerry Lewis who nearly ruined the entire thing."
5,Yankee Fan - and Loved It Anyway,"I saw the musical back in 1994, and met the stars of the show as well. Jarrod Emmick was one of the most gifted newcomers to broadway that I had seen in years, with a voice that could lift a house off the ground. I remembered Victor Garber from years ago, when he was in the movie, ""Godspell"" - I have his autograph on my tape of the soundtrack, in fact. I also had this album on tape, signed by the principals, but I can't seem to find it - it seems to be lost somewhere. At any rate, I'm not too upset - I still have the cover, which has the cast signatures on it. I intend to purchase the CD, since I don't think they sell tapes anymore. It was a wonderful show, and I deeply cherish the soundtrack which, for me, preserves the wonderful memories I have of the show and the people in it that I met. I would highly recommend it - especially if you were lucky enough to have seen the show."
4,Good Emo CD,A good band that hasn't ever really gotten credit. The big problem for them is that the music they play doesn't really fit most radio stations. Give them a shot though if you like emo music.
1,"Heard it before, and it was better before.","Not really a horrible band, but they don't really inspire me to want to listen to them. They sound like they could be good, maybe it was a bad producer, or them trying to be radio whores. Good singer, but pretty mundane melodies. The guitar work and drums are really really average. I wouldnt spend any money on this CD if i were you. go for something original, expand your horizon, i.e. Circa Survive, Paulson, Portugal. The Man, From First to Last, A static lullaby, The bled, cursive, he is legend, gatsbys american dream, The sound of animals fighting, vendetta red. All of these bands will expand your horizons, not numb them like Ten Falls Forth."
5,Fernando Ortega - Beginnings,"Great album, very soothing and uplifiting. Fernando has take some the old hymns and put his style and instrumentation to them. I recommend this album to anyone that likes renaissance style worship music, they will love it."
1,AMAZON PRICES ARE A RIP-OFF (SORRY BUT TRUE),"CHRISTIAN FRIENDS, IF YOU WANT A FERNANDO ORTEGA CD, JUST GO TO HIS WEBSITE AND RECEIVE GREAT PRICES FOR ""NEW"" PRODUCTS. I JUST BOUGHT THIS 2CD SET FOR NOTHING BRAND NEW. HOW CAN SOMEONE SELL THIS FOR $50.00 USED AND HAVE A CLEAR CONSCIENCE??WOW!!! GOD BLESS YOUR DAY!!"
5,Beautiful music from Amazon.,"Fernando again does not disappoint. If you love simple and reverent music, this collection is for you. Fernando is one of my all time favorites."
5,beautiful,"I love these songs - they bring a lot of peace, memories of childhood, hope, reflection, thankfulness, and a sense of coziness. Fernando Ortega and Andrew Peterson are two artists I could listen to all day long. - Actually I often do. :)"
4,"Techno, but not as we knew it","It was techno, but not as we knew it. Caustic, parched beats underpinned by the occasional hum of what sounded like stereo test signals, established this Finnish duo as masters of minimalist brutality. The dry, static crackle of their arid soundscapes suddenly made even Plastikman and the entire Basic Channel output sound like overblown epic house anthems. Nor were they without a sense of adventure: live shows were a contest between epuipment and audience, to see which- eardrum or signal generator-would give way first. Vakio was a staggering, original debut. Subsequent material would prove to be simply more of the same-after all, to be more minimalistic would be to disappear."
2,Doesn't last,"Bought this for my girl and she loved it, but it only lasted a few months. The bunny died, which makes it kinda useless. I fixed the motor, which was a huge pain, and the motor is incredibly low quality, it's a joke. Of course it died again in short order, as it's bound to. Don't buy this model unless you want to spend this money several times a year. If you don't care about reliability, then I'd give it 4 stars. Maybe the newer models have different motor designs, but I wouldn't count on it. Unfortunately, I'm guessing most manufacturers in this field are just as bad or worse, but I have nothing to compare against."
1,Not the same product it use to be!,"I have bought this product several times over the past 4 years. It had been my favorite vibrator after trying many! I have had several decadent indulgence 2 wear out and break. But, I love this vibrator so much that I keep replacing it. My most recent purchase, Dec. 2011, was disappointing. It is not the same vibrator as listed in the description. The company has changed the material that they use to make the shaft and rabbit with. It is a softer jelly and does not transmit the vibration like it use to. Also, the rabbit ears no longer have the textured nubs on them. I am severely disappointed that I purchased this Item thinking I knew exactly what I was getting, only to be sent a modified and useless product. Not returnable. Buyer beware!"
3,Not quite what I thought it would be.,The item works but not the way the maker makes it sound. The vibrations are not that strong. Cheaper and simpler models have more power. The rabbit part is too flexible and does not allow firm pressure against the clitorous. The rotation is very small and the beads did nothing for me. In my opinion it works but there are better ones at alot less money. The battery cover also comes off while in use.
3,More Information Needed on this First World Series,"I found this to be an enjoyable book to read in two sittings. I do think the title is somewhat misleading. The book is only 208 pages long with not a whole lot having to do with the World Series. Some of the book is spent on the Boston Royal Rooters cheering section along with its leaders Mike ""Nuf Sed"" McGreevey and John ""Honey Fitz"" Fitzgerald. This was appropriate, but I found too much of the book to be a description of the ethnic groups that made up the city of Boston at the turn of the century. I suppose the author felt that had to be done to increase the size of the book. The author, Roger Abrams, is a Professor of Law at Northeastern University which sits on the site of the old Huntington Avenue Grounds where the first World Series games were played in Boston. For additional information on the first World Series you may want to read Autumn Glory by Louis Masur."
2,The Piano Teacher,"I didn't find any story to this book. It was just gruesome, gruesome, gruesome, gory, gruesome, no story to it gruesome."
5,Pretty girls make graves.,"""Where The Wild Roses Grow"" made Nick Cave an international star, largely due to the overwhelming popularity of Kylie Minogue. This single was his highest-selling recording to date because of this; her fans as well as his rushed out to purchase it. It's a great song with a wonderful video (available on The Bad Seeds' videos compilation). But the best part about this single is the B-side, ""The Ballad of Robert Moore and Betty Coltraine."" It is one of my favorite Nick Cave songs (and that says a lot, considering his prolific output). ""The Willow Garden"", with vocals by pianist Conway Savage is also a nice touch to this trio of songs."
5,Truly Exceptional.,"I've now read four of Mr. Manchester's works and all have been excellent. This is one of the two best biographies, or framents thereof, that I have ever read. Mr. Manchester has a style of writing that belongs in the hands of a novelist, not a historian or biographer. He can make 900 pages fly by without you noticing. I've read the two first parts of his Churchill biography and am completely devastated that the last one will probably never be completed. I mourn for the loss of Mr. Manchester's wife but history will truly mourn the loss of the concluding piece of this opus."
5,Great Biography of a Great Man,"I truly believe that Winston Churchill should have been named Time magazine's Man of the Century. No other person in the 20th century affected the lives of so many. Author Manchester has attempted a three volume biography (volume 2 ends at the start of World War II and volume 3 has not yet been published), which succeeds magnificently. The author brings Churchill alive, and like any great man, he is also flawed, and these are presented without apology. Manchester's style of writing and organization is superb. The story of Churchill's youth and young adulthood is thoroughly explored. The author puts special emphasis on Churchill's childhood and the effects of his relationship with his parents which became obvious throughout his life.I would recommend this book highly."
4,The Last Lion Vol.1.,This is one of the longest books that I have ever read yet an outstanding read from one of my favorite authors.I will be looking for moreof manchesters books.The Last Lion: Vol.1.
3,"Attica, MI","I thought this book was hard to stay with. It was abit 'long' on Churchill'searly life which I didn't find terribly interestingIt's not the most readable book, although I always enjoy historically basedstories. I will try another of this authors book though, hoping for a more readable one."
4,Churchill depicted fairly,"I am 2/3rds through the book and am enjoying thoroughly. I like long biographical works, so I would be partial to this. Manchester writes elegantly and with style, and provides tons of details about the life and times. He did a good job with the background prior to Winston's birth, explaining well what he was born into.He also depicts Churchill fairly, he was clearly a remarkable character in the 20th century, but he does not put him on a pedestal. The flaws in his character are not hidden.I am having a lot of fun with this, and look forward to the 2nd book."
5,A statesman vs tyranny,A marvelously well written story of the birth of a statesman who came forward to inspire his nation in its darkest hour
4,A deep read,Detailed and interesting biography of the one man who could have led England and her dying empire through her darkest hours. One sees and then understands the manipulative personality as it develops. Churchill's life spans the height of the Empire through the late Victorian era through its decline to the post war decline to second power status; this is the opening chapter. At times twisted slightly chronologically and somewhat pompously written.
2,Save your money,Not the book to read if you're wanting clear and organized biography. This is neither. Major regret is that I paid so much for it.
4,very popular but,yeas the most popular book on sir winston but mistakes are in it and volume three will appear after a 20 years break .
2,Boring Subject,I decided to read this book because William Manchester is one of my favorite writers of history. I had previously read his book on Churchhill covering 1932-1940(The Last Lion). I decided to read this book because I thought this would be interesting too. The book covers Churchhills life from birth up to 1932. I have to say it was a disappointment. Manchester is great but Churchill's life up to 1932 is very boring compared to how reviting his life was after 1932. If I had it to read again I would pass. Not worth my time.
3,a book somewhat overrated,well this is the first book i read on winston churchill . bought it in 1983 . the foreword is unforgettable but historical mistakes in it makes this work not the very best on the luife of sir winston. great prose nevetheless.same can be said of book number two.
5,"Great Writing, Great Content","The Last Lion; Winston Spencer Churchill - Visions of Glory 1874 to 1932 is a segment of the life of an active politician that encompasses the Raj, the First World War, and the interim between World Wars. Among the outstand parts of this well researched book are the role played by Churchill in the attempted management of India by Great Brittan, and in the tragedy at Gallipoli during the Turkish Campaign. The book gives insight to details of important historical events that influenced the course of British history - written in a manner that earns it five stars."
5,It couldn't be better,"There may be other biographies of Churchill, but NO ONE writes like William Manchester. His account of the evacuation at Dunkirk (also known as The Miracle!) gives me the chills every time I read it. His deft handling of a tremendous amount of material (Churchill was involved in nearly every major international political event of the first half of the twentieth century) is impressive as well. I only pray that Mr. Manchester will complete the projected 3-volume biography."
3,Won't play on my regular DVD player,"Although it will play on my computer's DVD player. I've tried it on two different DVD players...neither work with my television. Love the music, love the opera...just disappointed I can't play it on my television - without connecting my computer to it."
2,ONLY BERNSTEIN FANS NEED APPLY,"The production, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, who composed the score and wrote the libretto, can be considered the official version of what he had in mind. As such Bernstein fans, as well as those who are interested in the best known American Man of Music in his time, will find it a most useful source for judging the merits of the composer at an early stage of his development as a major purveyor of classical music. For that purpose, a contribution to understanding the development of The Maestro, I recommend it highly. Considered as a contribution to 20th century music or to Bernstein's stature, it is a distinctly minor work.Animation as scenery, singing , orchestral support and over-all direction seems to make the most of the material.In sum, an enjoyable brief (44 minutes)visit with an amiable Bernstein work but no great shakes as a contribution to 20th Century opera."
3,badbones,another bob fancy farce that works with some belly laughs to boot. L Ball does an ok job but hope is funny.
4,Fancy Pants,Quite enjoyed this film - though it is starting to show its age - good to see two very popular comedy players on screen - the site gags and occasional mugging to the camera gives it a nce touch
4,Worth the price for one joke,"My all time favorite movie joke, ""Three Against a Thousand"" is told beautifully by Bob Hope in this 1950 western. He has several very nice vaudeville scenes especially near the beginning of the movie.When he becomes a tough cowboy talking down to tough cowboys he is great. Most of the film is average and Lucy shows promise just shortly before she became TV's biggest star in the 50s.I recommend it for fans of vaudeville schtick, and Hope and Lucy fans will enjoy it also."
2,Not at All What You Think!,"I am totally dissapointed in this film and I'm a huge Bob Hope fan. There is no excuse for this sorry film though, Bob hardly does any of his one liners and the film borders on stupidity. Please save your money and get another of his films like Son of Paleface, Where There's Life."
5,HOPE & LUCY= WACKY WESTERN SPOOF....,"A remake with songs of ""Ruggles of Red Gap"", ""Mr.Robert Hope"" plays an English Valet going to work for Lucille Ball's nouveau riche family in the Wild West. For fans of Hope and Lucy, this is a delight. They're in top form in ""Fancy Pants""...the name given Hope by tomboy Lucy. Good supporting cast helps enliven this spoof, but it's Hope and Lucy who really pull it off. They're a great team. Lucy sings ""Fancy Pants"" and there are other songs and lots of slapstick and beautiful Technicolor filming that helps explain why Lucy was once known in Hollywood as ""Tessie Technicolor"". She's gorgeous here. ""Fancy Pants"" is good, clean, fun family fare and, sadly, another example of the kind of film ""they just don't make anymore"". And yes, you can see Lucy Ricardo emerging in this film. For historical value alone ""Fancy Pants"" is worth watching and owning."
4,"HEY, FANCY PANTS!!","This movie was absolutely hilarious from beginning to end. I thought the storyline could have been stronger, but still laughed like crazy at Lucy's antics, as usual. :)"
3,Not really a killer !,Did I get anything out of the book? Yes. Will it go down on my list of memorable reads? No. Tim Sanders gives a fair pep talk for compassion and networking in business but others have done it much better. The best chapter is on 'Knowledge' where Tim refers to the many business books that have helped him along the way. Worth reading but go to the library first. Not a keeper.
4,that missing touch,"i finished this book over one weekend!it's a refeshing approach to 'making it happen' in today's corporate/ working enviroment.that human touch, that memorable handshake, those encouraging words, that special someone that retains in your mind.with the three keys: knowledge, network and compassion, tim sanders captures what it takes to make it(outside the realm of business school).it's simple, powerful and passionate! thoroughly enjoy it!!!"
3,Not a book for everyone,"This book espouses the practice of giving as a way of ""making it"" in the professional life. There are examples sourced from the author's experience of using his self-described ""lovecat"" ways to succeed in business.After reading this book I felt pretty mediocre about putting this into action for my own self-growth. There are pieces I strongly agreed with - specifically that the more you give, the more you receive. But the method of pushing content out as described in the book just isn't my style. It seems overly aggressive and self-promoting. I find it hard to imagine following it to the letter.I'm sure I got some good ideas from this book, but I'm just not sure it's for everyone to follow the path the author suggests."
4,Puts networking in perspective,"Sanders' take on business is refreshing. He brings out a lot of the common sense that has been beaten out of us in the business world. Has some great tips on networking, an does a good job of supporting his thesis that genuinely connecting with and caring about people is the most rewarding road in life, even for the businessperson. Wasn't crazy about his lingo, like ""biz love"" and ""love cat"", but the material makes up for it."
4,A positive outlook for cultivating relationships,Excellent for cultivating relationships. Great to learn how to add value to your customers and your business. A great positive outlook. Inspires really positive thinking. I highly recommend. A very good read.
5,Be a Lovecat and Give It Away,"I enjoyed the concepts, explanations, and practical advice.If you're a pessimist, you may not enjoy this book... If you believe that Nice Smart People Succeed, this will energize you."
2,Pathetic,"Wow.. [...] Listening to this guy speak reminded me of some yuppie seminar. The main idea of the book? Be nice, introduce people to others with no strings, read books and recommend books to others. Find out how to become a lovecat - a nice, smart person who succeeds in business and in life. 'Pass."
1,Pure Dreck,"This book is typical of the tail-end of the dot-com arrogance - truly inane ideas propped up on the vestige of a famous corporate association. Taking a reality check you'll find that few corporate leaders believe ""love is the killer app"" - its a good-time-charlie philosophy that sounds plausible when your stock is rising 20% a day, but when layoffs are the only thing keeping your HR staff employed, this claim is empty and shallow. So we know the core idea of this book is not plausible. Now for the book itself - this book is a horrible read, almost completely devoid of worthwhile content."
1,You're No Dale Carnegie,"I read this book, hoping to learn something new. Unfortunately, it was a rehash of other writers' ideas. There is nothing original in this book. Also, the book feels like a soapbox for Mr. Sanders to brag and put the spotlight on how he does everything right. In general, I have found such 'gurus' to be phony."
3,Love Is the Killer App,"This book is easy to read. However, I counted 32 other books referenced in this particular book. I guess I really can't rate this book until I read the other books to see if they were helpful. The best advice this book gave was to keep your word and don't overextend yourself."
4,Keep an open mind,"The premise of this book is how to be yourself and use the power of reading to share with other professionals. It is a feel good book about ""being a Love Cat"" and sharing knowledge with others. It is a fresh perspective of how to make everything a win win. Add a little compassion, organization, and good old fashion hard work and you have a guide to building your knowledge and business accumen."
2,"Yes, be nice","I found the book did not add much value. If you ever thought that emotions and friendships are not needed in the world of business, then you need to read this book.If you genuinely care for others it shows. Sanders makes the case that by helping others we help ourselves.To me, it is all part of good business practice and having a balanced life."
5,Outstanding,"This book is the best!It is one of the most useful and inspiring books I ever read!!!It tells you how to spread love throughout the cold, unfeeling corporate world of one line emails and cubicle prisons."
4,Every person needs to read it!,"I enjoyed reading this book. It's cool and easy to read. One cool thing is that it not only teaches you about love at work but it also teaches you how you should read books. The last chapters of this book are the best. So hang on and keep reading. A few words I didn't understand at first, but after a few chapters I understood what the writer meant. This book is about networking and how to implement love and other affections in your biz and professional life. This book is not a five star because I find that sometimes it wanders around and doesn't get to the point, and also it's easy to read and you do enjoy it but if you really want to get the whole picture you have to pay attention and try to focus. All in all it is a must read and he gives some cool examples at the end. Enjoy it!!"
5,Life changing book,"Here is a book with information that you can actually apply in your life. If you are an ehthusiastic person about biz-life, Sanders gives you very tangible tips on how to become a successful biz-person by becoming a 'lovecat'.3 major rules in the book:1. Read a lot of books and share your knowledge with others.2. Network all the time. Make use of your contacts and share them with others. Introduce people who would benefit from each other.3. Share your compassion with other people.As a result, Tim's theory is that by showing biz-love to your business partners, you will be on your way to become a very successful person.The ideas in the book are clear and concise. They are conveyed in a very convincing manner. Also it's very interesting reading (listening in my case I got the Audio CD).Highly recommended!"
4,Simple formula for quantum growth.,"In ""Love is the Killer App"" Tim Sanders writes about the importance of knowledge (gaining and sharing), networking and compassion. His book comes across as an exercise in what he is trying to teach--I felt Tim was sharing knowledge, introducing me to his network and treating me with compassion.The principles that he espouses may not be new--but he definitely endows them with new life.For those of you that have to influence others on a daily basis, Tim provides some excellent ideas that you can use to raise your status in the eyes of your clients to that of a ""trusted advisor"".I really liked the way he looks at everything life/business strategy in terms of whether or not it will ""scale"".This book offers some great yet simple ideas that, when applied, can greatly enhance your business and social life."
3,The value of intangibles,"This book is a treatise on the value of intangibles in business: value of knowledge, compassion, and networks. Describing himself as a 'lovecat', Tim Sanders strongly encourages establishing a solid book-reading habit, a habit for compassion towards your 'bizmates', and an open Rolodex. In the end, it comes down to building a valuable personal brand: treat everyone with respect, you never know what the future holds. If you're already convinced of the value of reading and networks, you might want to look at something else on the bookshelf, and if not, it will be a good investment of your time."
4,Mechanics Review: Details but no,"This book has some great ideas on how to have more value in business than just your standard job function. The idea of this book is teach you how to be more valuable to others, but it does involve outside effort--which is supposed to pay off as you show others you love them in a nice, brotherly sort of way. Showing this love has 3 parts. 1- Gaining outside knowledge through reading many books and then sharing it with those who it will help. 2- Building a network of other professionals and getting everyone in touch as you see opportunities that will be beneficial to 2 or more nodes in your network. 3- Showing compassions (or love) to others as they experience the highs and lows of the business world.These are the building blocks to the book. (...)"
4,Some great Todd tunes,"This album has some must-have Todd music: I Hate My Frickin' ISP (tongue in cheek but every netizen will empathize), Buffalo Grass, Hit Me Like A Train (wow. just... wow) , Surf Talks, but most of all Where Does the Time Go (this one should be a Top Ten hit). Some songs took a few listens to love: Jerk, Yer Fast And I Like It, Love of the Common Man (remake). I must admit I could have lived without Bang on the Ukele and Mary and the Holy Ghost. Nonetheless any Todd fan will enjoy the album overall, and selected cuts are good intro material for those who haven't become Todd fans yet."
5,BEST EVER,This is Todd Rundgren's all-time best CD. I HATE ME FRICKIN I.S.P. shows how much of a comedian he really is....and YER FAST (AND I LIKE IT) expresses how he wishes he was fast. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THIS CD YOU NEED HELP!
3,"If you like Todd Rundgren, you'll like this album.","If you like Todd Rundgren, you'll like this album. If you don't really know Todd Rundgren, check this out.It's got a winning combination of love songs and rockers, all witty, playful, and full of soul. The first single, entitled ""I Hate My Frickin ISP,"" is punk for the office crowd, reveling in the all-too-real angst of the desk jockey and traveling cyber-salesman, while ""Buffalo Grass"" is a hypnotic love song about inevitable, inescapable romance. Other noteworthy tracks include the Don Ho-inspired ""Bang on the Ukulele Daily,"" the dippy ditty ""Where Does the Time Go,"" and a Bossa Nova reworking of his classic ""Love of the Common Man."" Styles on this album range from fun/faux Trent Reznor through ambient-techno to plain old guitar rock. Rundgren likes to let us know that he stills listens to what's hip."
1,Woefully Disappointing,1 star....if that. This is without a doubt the very worst hodge podge I have ever heard. He combined old and new trying to make some kind of coherent work. Doesn't work. I love Todd like no other. I see him everytime he comes through town and 1st saw him back in the 70's at The Kennedy Center in DC with his first incarnation of Utopia featuring Moogy et al and have not missed a concert since. Love all of his music...but this....this is not the Todd I know. Sorry everyone.
3,I like his voice.,"Actually, his voice is very good. And tunes contain various style: Bosa nova, Rock, Hawaian, dance music, Techno... We can realize his 2000's new style of sound."
4,Mellencamp never fails to please!,"DANCE NAKED is a great rock/folk album. Take ""Brothers,"" a story about two brothers who just don't get along...in fact hate each other. Or the title track, which remains romantic even though he's basically asking his girl to strip for him. Or ""L.U.V."", a politcally-aimed song of what's wrong in the world. Or ""Another Sunny Day"", about the future and a man's hope how it will all turn out. Or...Dear God, every song on this album is good. All nine of them shine with expert songwriting (even the remake of Van Morrison's ""Wild Night"") and superb instrumentalism. DANCE NAKED may not be Mellencamp's best (he's had a lot of time to record albums), but it's certainly right up there. A must for fans of the genre, or Mellencamp's legions of fans."
3,OK Album With a Few Good Cuts,"It was said that Mellencamp ripped this album out in record time - this album was released fast on the heels of his ""Human Wheels"" album - a few good cuts (""Brothers"", Dance Naked"", ""Wild Night"", ""L.U.V."") mixed in with a couple of clunkers"
1,"Terrrible, just terrible","Put aside his wacked on politics, this CD sucks.I got it free at a garage sale and I should have left it in the free bin.Dont forget John Jeb 08 and 2012"
2,Buy the Nano PLUS instead,"This player is a good product, but if I could do it over again, I would buy the Zen Nano PLUS. The regular Nano doesn't come with the FM tuner or arm band. If you want to buy an arm band it costs another $20. For this extra $20 I could have bought the Nano Plus with the arm band and a FM tuner. I've only had the player for a short time and I had an issue when downloading songs to it. Apparently you have to put your songs into folders then move them into the player, not a big deal and the customer support was very quick in getting me an answer to this issue. I'm rating this item as a 2 because of the cost between it and the PLUS. I would recommend the player, but get the PLUS (which I would rate at a 4). Works great for my workouts, if only I had an arm band. Get the PLUS, have I said that enough."
2,Music,"I purchased this item so my son could dowmload music. We purchased a $14.95 suscription from Napster so he could download unlimited songs into it only to find out that it is not compatible with them so in addition to the monthly fee they also want you to pay .99 per song. In order to download music without the fee it would have had to be the Zen Nano Plus. I was under the impression that the regular Nano was also compatible. So be careful what you purchase and make sure you get what your looking for. Other that that it seems to be a good player with good quality sound and easy to use menu. A word of advise to parents thinking about joining Napster, don't do it. Once you give them your credit card info you cant take it back and you can't call them either."
1,Great MP3 player if you want your player to not play music,"It stopped working for no reason at all (beside it being junk) after just one month. Creative also wants ME to foot the repair bill. No thanks, but I'd rather throw it away than send these con-artists any more of my money.It could happen to you."
3,Should have bought iPod nano instead.,"Bought one one week ago. Regretted upon receiving the item. Should have bought an iPod nano instead. (iPod nano 1G version in Apple Store for Education is only $129.)Pros:- Small size- Drag-and-drop file management in Windows explorerCons:- Small mono-color LCD- Menu and button inconvenient to use: very difficult to find and play songs, terrible interface compared to iPod's click-wheel- I bought a black one but it came with a while earbud. How ugly is that.- The earbud seems too big and quite uncomfortable.I would suggest buy an iPod nano instead."
3,NO FM Tuner unless you buy the + model,I was extremely disappointed after purchasing the Zen Nano for a gift. After it arrived from Amazon and I opened the package and only then did I discover it did not have a FM tuner. Without the tuner the use as a gift went down to 0.Be careful that you get the exact model the + (plus) if you want a tuner
3,I have a question,I was wondering if anyone has used the voice recorder on this MP3 player. I need to record a lot of lectures so I was wondering how good the quality of the recording is on the Zen player. What has other people's experience been like? And how many hours of audio recording can you save on the player?
3,"Lots of features, but poor construction","The Zen Nano looks great on paper, in the pictures, and in the packaging, but as soon as you take it out you can feel how poorly constructed the player really is. The casing and buttons (which look metallic at first) are made of soft plastic that scratches VERY easily. I can see 50% of owners breaking or losing the battery cover within a week. Sometimes the random playback feature has a glitch that causes it to repeat the same few tracks over and over, and the software that came with the player will often inexplicably rip only part of a CD. On the other hand, this player has a ton of nice features and is at a decent price point. I wouldn't buy it again if I had the option, or I would have at least bought the white model instead."
3,MP3 Player,Bought it to use while traveling. I download audio books to listen to while I am driving. Works well. Screen is a little hard to see.
1,Absolute trash! Don't waste your time or money!,"Tell me something, how does this so-called ""man of God"" continue to get away with writing such slanderous garbage? Really, I don't doubt for a moment that many negative events are taking place presently to bring forth Satan's New World Order, but the way this guy puts it on paper is nothing short of disgraceful and pitiful! Texe Marrs needs an intellectually honest editor.Indeed, this book leaves me with no respect for Texe Marrs or his work. Furthermore, I've heard rumors recently that the IRS has revoked Texe Marrs' tax-exempt 501(c)(3) ministry for violating the law and mishandling ministry funds. Perhaps we should call him in Austin and ask him about this?"
1,WHAT??? You people take this seriously?,"Honestly, get over yourselves, this book is trash, there is clearly not enought room to here to detail all the obvious flaws in this book, It's pretty funny though that people take this seriously, I just typed '666' in the search to see what would come up, and you people take this seriously?? Get a life, its so funny."
5,Read the facts and research it yourself,Thia book had left me in a greater understanding of what is to come. Texe has done outstanding research to back up every thing he is portraying in his book. I was not eager to believe it until i looked up the magazines and news paper articals myself. People Christians or not please take note of this book . The scripture backs Texe up.As do the things that are happening even today ! I hope he writes more on the subject and reveals more of what he has found out due to his research since this book was published ..
2,it's a start,"a bit extreme. i do enjoy most of the works by Mr. Marrs, but too many accusations with no truly hard evidence. not saying that it's bad, but it may be a start to something... i have no doubts that some are powerbound, but there needs to be more evidence."
4,Fat Teens Unite!,For every chubby girl out there...Thank you Ms. Rabinowitz. Amy is a hero to all of us. I have gone through my high school years much heavier than Amy ever was. And I know how hard it is to find someone to love you for who you are and not what you look like.
4,Good Cooling Case,The case is large and has good room to drop in the motherboard. Build quailty is average but normal in this price range. Ventilation is very good. Instructons could be a lot better. The case does it's job and for the price is it an overclockers bargain. The only big negative is that it has difficult cable management.
4,Amazing ventilation,"This case has wonderful airflow. Two 12cm fans on their lowest setting cool two 5.25""x3 drive bays thoroughly, and it's all sucked out and more by a huge custom fan on top and another 12cm fan on the rear. It looks stunning, too.No built-in speaker and the use of molex instead of 3 pin motherboard fan connectors take a star away."
1,terrible on the inside,"the case is beautiful yes, but its horrible to arrange wires in! i had a modular PS and still have cables everywhere! and you can't really stash them anywhere so they are all over the place. Also i had to remove one of the fan mounts on the back of one of the places that holds drives in order to get my video card to fit inside. def wouldn't get this thing again if i would of known how bad it was with room on the inside. Also had a hard time getting my MB inside it correctlypretty much its a nightmare. don't expect to have it standing on display unless you plan on drilling holes for cables"
4,Great Case,"Pros:- Quiet - Has many fans, but you can barely hear them.- Durable- Looks awesome - The glass panel on the side of the case that allows you to see the innards is definitely a plus.- Modular design - I like how you can swap the position of the hard drive / external bays.Cons:- There is no switch to turn off the LEDs. This makes it difficult to sleep.- Cable management is tricky- Heavy - weights about 19 pounds"
4,Good enthusiat's case.,I built a new system for my son with this case. I was able to install 2 DVD drives; a floppy drive; 3 hard drives; and a video card with no problems.The best part about this case is that my son likes to see all the colors and then fans moving.
4,Worth its price,"It's a very good box, well worth it's price. I should know, cause I paid double for it (I live in colombia, and that thing is big)"
4,"the perfect case, almost","this is the near perfect case. I say near perfect because the cooling is phenomenal, the connections such as top mounted usb/firewire are ultra convenient, and the looks and build are excellent. The only reason it is a 4 star is because the power supply mounts on the bottom. A decent idea, but it means that the main power cable must have a very long power line, or it won't reach your motherboards connector. I had to buy a new one, because my 1 year old psu was too short. A setback, but it was worth it because thats how nice this case is."
4,"Great case, but I deduct 1 star....","I deduct 1 star:* The case could stand to be a little bit longer from front to back to accomodate the 8800 video cards. They fit but it's a little tight. Granted, I'm sure the design of the case predates the 8800's release.I really love the airflow and the utter silence of the case. The fans are very low noise, making this case vastly quieter AND cooler than my old case. Installation wasn't a problem aside from screwing in the drives, which apparently works better when I read the directions. The placement of the buttons and USB plugs on the top also works well for me, since I have my computer on the floor."
4,There are better cases out there.,"This is a very beautiful case but if i could do it again, i would have put a few more dollars into it and bought a nicer looking one. Dont get me wrong, the case gets the job done so it gets 4 stars from me but the cable management is pretty bad and the inside would have been nice if it was black. I def like how it came with the fans but they cannot be controlled by the mobo. There are at preset speeds that you set up and if you want to change the fan speed you have to open it and manually change them. You can solve that by buying fans though. The air flow is good although it collects alot of dust. All in all, it is a good case but if you can get something better for a few bucks more, go for it"
4,Build Your own,"Nice contruction..enough fans...a little louder than I expected, just a tad smaller inside than you might want...But premo parts fit well....Hope the buttons last a long time"
4,Good Case,Good amount of room and lots of fans. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it lacks the easily removable drive trays that a lot of cases have. Screwdriver needed to pull drives out of the case.
5,Great Enthusiast case and it's quiet!,"What's not to like here? It's a big case that moves a ton of air and is quiet while doing it. The only thing else I would put on it is a carying handle for LAN parties. My former case was the Antec Super Lanboy so I had high expectations for this case. It didn't let me down a bit. This rig sits on top of my desk at present and it's more quiet than my old Super Lanboy. I read a few articles about space issues when you have a big card in it but I had no problems moving the parts and pieces around to match the different configs I tried. Setup: Intel E6600, ATI x1900 xt, 2gb OCS Platinum, Abit ab9pro,Raidmax RX630, DVD burner, floppy, Vista RC1 ... and still going...."
4,"Good Metal work and fit, short wires","I was impressed with the fit of this case. The lack of insufficent stand offs, short front panel leads put a stick in the mud."
3,Get the Nine Hundred Two instead,spend another $10 - $20 and get the Antec Nine Hundred Two instead it is a much nicer case.
3,"If you have a long graphic card, this is NOT your case","I have built computer since 1986, in another word, I am good.Pro's:- Quiet, even with four fans.- Provides excellent air circulation, system kept very cool,I'm running a Q6600 Quad-Core with a 8800GTX Video card, and 3 eATA HDD.Con's:- Not enough space on the inside, very tight when you have a long graphic card in the middle, and a lot of cabling you will need to shift around. It takes me about 5 hours to put a simple system together.- Very mother board connectors for case fans. It means that your mother board can not control the fan speed.- Limitted front panel features, no lights for HDDIf you're building a gaming or video editing workstation (especially with 8800 cards), I would not recommend this case. (You will definately need more space, and higher quality ports/cabling.)"
4,LED's stopped working,"I've had this case for probably 2 years and just recently the LED's in the front fans have stopped working.Overall, it's a nice case. It's roomy inside and all the fans do a nice job at cooling things down. When the LED's worked, it was a really cool looking computer case."
3,Is it a Novel?,"I expected a story about a particularly elusive deer nicknamed Elvis. What I got was an ethics lesson and a bit of a history lesson and not enough story. Since I fling arrows and bow hunt with a recurve, I guess some will take it that I am being disrespectful to the brethren. It's just that when someone calls their book a novel, I have the habit of expecting a story. When I don't get my story, I'm disappointed. Mr. Hamm is a great historian, ethicist and he seems to write well, but this book doesn't know what it wants to be. I would ask Mr. Hamm to write his own explanation here on Amazon. You have no excuse being disappointed if you know what you are getting. I didn't...I was."
2,The Ant and the Grasshopper Move Out,"While the book is short enough so kids might actually read it, the cartoons are a bit corny and the advice complicated by the ""Dic is a screw up"" and ""Donna is Miss Perfect"" comparison. So, while Donna's preparations for moving are coming along nicely, Dic is partying and neglecting his moving duties.Since many of the books out there on leaving home are textbook in style, and most young adults won't read a word of them, Leaving Home has brevity on its side, along with those helpful lists at the back of the book. The problem is the good girl/bad boy style garbles the message. The cartoon characters are also somewhat dated with Dic looking like a cross between the Fonz and Danny Zucko in Grease. 50 Ways to Leave Your Mother"
2,Not bad; interesting background on the Romulans,"The Romulans are the ""other"" bad guys in the Star Trek universe, along with the Klingons, from whom they differ considerably.""The Romulan Way"" features a fairly interesting storyline coupled with some very interesting flashbacks of early Romulan history, which explains (this author's interpretation) how the Romulans left Vulcan, and why they became implacable enemies of Earth and the Federation.This is an above-average Star Trek novel. Its main flaw is a somewhat murky style of writing, and a somewhat slow-moving plot. It did hold my interest, however, and most Star Trek fans will enjoy this story."
4,Another must-read from everyone's favorite ST novelist,"As others here have said, this novel does for the Romulans what SPOCK'S WORLD did for the Vulcans. It follows S.W.'s structure of alternate chapters telling the story of the Rihannsu (as they call themselves) with a plot taking place one year after MY ENEMY, MY ALLY (another of Duane's ST novels).A couple of caveats. This is one of a handful of ST novels in which Kirk and Spock barely appear, so if they're your favorite characters you may be disappointed. Rumor has it that this novel brought on the Wrath of Roddenberry since it based its picture of the Romulans on D.C. Fontana's work in the original series rather than the vastly different Romulans of ST:TNG.With these qualifications I recommend this novel highly, esp. if you're looking for something diffferent and challenging in the ST canon."
4,"Old, but good.","One of the better Trek books, in my opinion. Diane Duane excels at world and mythos creation in this book, narrating both the history and modern day trials of the ""Romulans"" with a dry wit and shrewd cynicism. Yet, she managed to make me feel for them as a people in a way few authors have. There are mostly original characters in this novel, but the appearances from the bridge crew have the usual sparkle that Diane Duane lends to them."
3,Colonial Vipers,Three stars...just read the other three star reviews and know that I concur. I just can't believe that no one has pointed out that the two ships on the books's cover (to the right of McCoy's head) are clearly Colonial Vipers from Battlestar Galactica. Hilarious!
3,Half a classic,"The alternating stories are a bit distracting. The `A' about McCoy is a standard level ST adventure. The `B' story recounting the Vulcan dissipation and the founding of the Romulan homeworld is tremendous, deep, thoughtful, and serious. Since a cover with McCoy probably more readily identifies the book as formal ST and markets the product better we get only half a book length of a tremendous epic. Also unfortunately, since this is not canon (as it is only in print, not shown on TV) and ST:Nemesis pretty much invalidates the single race concept of the twin planets, it is a wasted opportunity to give some much needed background on why the Romulans became such bad people. Oh, well. Diane Duane is, for my money, the best ST author working. Wonderful."
2,ahhhhhhh sad,"Ok this movie was horribly boring. Way to much talking and incredibly embarising to watch because it was really bad. My aunt, uncle, and grandfather attended Cornell and the University of Md. Which is the state I live in was kinda a quiencident but this movie ehhh. Lets just say MADE FOR TV."
2,I would prefer to actualy take the SAT than watch this...,"This is a bad movie. Most of the actors can't act, and the ""stoner"" is quite possibly the most annoying character / actor ever created on film. Oh what a TV movie ending... 2 hours of my life watching the kids try to steal the SAT answers and in the end..they chicken out? Wow, gutless wonders and a jip to anyone that agreed with the sentiments echoed early in the film about the SAT. A movie that lacks the courage of its own convictions. That is ABC afternoon special territory.When this movie started and I realized that one of the kid's dad owned the building that ETS was in I thought... well this movie will be over fast. But 2 hours later, even with keys to the building, these kids can't get the SAT answers, I realized why they SHOULD go to 2nd tier schools. They obviously aren't that bright.There was a much better story on this subject a few years back called ""Cheaters"" which was based on a true story. Don't waste your time on this."
2,Stupid and Rebellious Entry to the Teen Genre,"Not impressed. Although I love the main ensemble and the catchy film style... the story, writing, characters and plot are just so horrible. Not to mention, the ""good"" girl turns into a total jerk at the end, and we're supposed to think that's awesome... Messed up movie with a messed up message and messed up filmmaking."
3,It's Just About the Stars.,"The plot of THE PERFECT SCORE is easy enough: six very different high school students bond together to steal the answers to the SAT test the night before it is administered. The movie takes a little while to build up and tries to be a teen version of THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. Unfortunately, the people who originally came to see this film (and the ones whom MTV marketed it to) weren't really coming to watch a movie; they were coming to see the people who were starring in the movie. The girls wanted to see Chris Evans, Bryan Greenberg, and basketball player Darius Miles while the guys came to see Erika Christensen and Scarlett Johansson. Therefore, though the movie has an interesting set-up, it never really delivers and ends up being just another teen movie that most people will forget fifteen minutes after watching it. I enjoyed watching the movie, but outside of the people who star in it, there's nothing outstanding about it."
2,Commerical,Well it only looks good from the preview but really its a crappy movie. There was a way to relate to the movie if you were in high school but it was a crappy cliche love story part. I like the idea of the movie but not the movie itself.
4,sorry don't cheat on test ?,"a few laughs as ""smart"" kids steal test answers so they can get what each wants.some may believe kids would steal answer & not use them but not me. if an effort is made by someone then they will go all the way. otherwise just teen kids fun movie doing teen stuff. there is real life thing I'd like to say: ivy league schools dismiss sat test, they want hobbies & risk taking. they look for people who will bring fame & spot lights to the school."
1,Bo-ring,"You're expected to believe that a stereotypical band of teens break into the Educational Testing Service and steal SAT results. Not likely. Am I being too serious? Well, at least the casting didn't have to be so right out of ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" replete with the requisite stoner, black basketball jock, average Joes and a couple of hot chicks to tempt the boys. I did other things during the middle of this and managed to catch the ending just in time to be quite enough. Watch if you are really bored and have nothing else on hand."
4,the perfect movie,this was a great movie dont bother renting this movie just buy it it is worth twenty dollars
5,A charming heroine with a mind of her own,"One of my favorite historical romance books of all time. I bought it some three years ago but I still enjoy reading it. Heroine Harriet has actually personality and a mind of her own. The hero is just as those literary misunderstood ""beast"" - heros should be. Add some quite hot and appealing love scenes and you have some enjoyable hours ahead of you."
4,Taming the Beast,"Miss Harriet Pomeroy is a dedicated archaeologist and spinster. Then she finds some amazing bones as well as smugglers in the caves belonging to Gideon Westbrook, Viscount St. Justin, Beast of Blackthorne Hall. Harriet and Gideon join forces to defeat the smugglers and an arch-villain with a grudge. They also end up making sweet love on the floor of the cave at high tide. But you know how it is, fossils are so erotic. Despite the machinations of Gideon's nemesis, the terrible scandals circulating about him, and the kindhearted though misplaced efforts of Harriet's new friends, the two manage to find truth, happiness, and a way to ""tame the beast."""
4,I thought the book brought on a fun reading experience!,"When I read the small summary on the book, it sounded exciting. And when I read it the guarentee was exactly what I got. I read straight through in 8 hours and only put the book down to have a couple of snacks. It was a fun read!"
5,Wonderful Book!!,"Amanda Quick did excellent with this book! The characters were awesome! I have had complaints about the character development with some of Quick's other novels, however, I must say that Harriet and Gideon were so real!! Harriet was one of the strongest character's that I've ever encountered in any romance novel before!!! She knew exactly what she wanted and how she felt and didn't let anything stop her.. not once through the entire book! It was wonderful!! And Gideon was a wonderful sensitive man who had to learn how to love once again. His character was one who didn't take things for granted since he had already been throught so much pain and hardship that he really treasured what he did have.The only complaint I had about this book was that the story line was much too predictable, I think she could have done so much more with it, especially with such original and wonderful characters! However it still gets 5 stars in my opinion, definatly a book worth reading!"
3,*** Three & a Half Stars ***,"This story is about a woman (Harriet) who works with fossils and learns thieves have been hiding out in the caves she frequents. She summons Viscount St. Justin (Gideon) to chase them away. Gideon's scarred face, brawny build and reputation as a murderer create a monstrous character. Like Harriet, the reader quickly learns that Gideon is every inch a gentleman. He may not be handsome, but he has every other grand attribute in three-fold. You will truly fall in love with his character.Although predictable at times, this was a sweet romance about two ordinary but peculiar looking people. This was my first Amanda Quick novel and I would not hesitate to buy another one."
2,Nothing ravishing about it,"I really wanted to like this book. I like other books written by Amanda Quick and a mystery to solve alongside a budding romance usually leaves a smile on my face. However the further I got into this book the worst my mood became. The heroine is beyond annoying. I don't mind having a hobby or even being eccentric about a particular interest, but every other word out of her mouth is bone this bone that. I didn't believe the romance between her and the hero. It was force and it seemed fights were always set up between them so that they could end up making out only to fight again once they finished. If you're looking for a book to take your breath away and characters you want to root for, or a love story to end all love story--this is not it. Not worth the hours of hoping maybe a turn of the page will reveal something worthwhile."
2,soooo Boring!!!,"This just isn't my week, this is the second book that I regret taking a chance on. I found this book so dreadfully boring. The two leads get together very quickly, there is no tension, none, between them. No fighting, no angst, nothing. They got along from the start and continued to get along until the bitter end of the book, snore!!! I found the leading lady slightly annoying and also pushy. I honeslty do not know why this book took so long to wrap up, to me it could have been a short story, couple meet, couple kiss etc, get engaged end of story. The reason why I gave this book two stars instead of one is because the writing was not terrible, I have read one other amanda quick book that I liked, there was tension and something to keep me turning the pages....gosh I hope my luck gets better I can't afford to keep buying books that put me to sleep!!"
3,"As always: Light, fun, a little repetitious","I am re-reading these Amanda Quick regencies. They are upbeat and fun, but after awhile, I get tired of the silly heroine having the same conversation over and over again with the hero. Hero: Do this; Heroine: No, because a,b,c.....Hero: Do this; Heroine: No, because a,b,c.....There isn't much growth in the characters, and the heroines seem to be the same in every book."
4,Beauty & the Beast,"My 1st by this author. I was impressed with this very sweet, easy to read little tale. The heroine has an interesting hobby studying fossils. She's intelligent without being annoying. Liked the beauty and the beast feel too."
3,"Maybe I am being premature in my review, but...","I have read A. Quick's books before, and have yet to find one I have totally loved. But for some reason I keep going back to her books. I guess because her writing is usually fast-paced and light, and an enjoyable read.Unfortunately, I am in the middle of reading this book and it is boring me utterly. Where is the conflict? It's sweet to see Harriet's constant defense of Gideon, but the two main characters just don't seem to mesh well. I am just hoping the rest of the novel isn't as disappointing as the beginning."
5,Fun heroine with great hero,"This is another great story by Amanda Quick. The heroine is fun with her own unique style. She is smart and doesn't hesitate to take action yet she isn't overwhelming. The hero in this is what I consider a true alpha, determined, clever, with a in your face kind of personality yet he is considerate of the heroine and actually enjoys her unusual way of life. The plot is also fun and kept my interest enough that I stayed up late to finish it. Really enjoyed this one"
2,Shallow and annoying,"I purchased this book because I like to read about troubled, scarred heroes. But this one was just too much for me. The plot was very shallow, and the relationship between the characters rushed and unlikely. The heroine,that collects old bones in ancient caves (very usual for a 18th century woman), is very annoying. Didn't like it."
3,Ravished by Amanda Quick,"I love this book! It was ""Ravished"" that got me hooked on the romance genre. For me it is a story of love being blind, beauty being in the eye of the beholder and most importantly the right person will think you are beautiful no matter what you look like on the outside.I have read most of the Amanda Quick stories and love her work, especially her heroines, whom are strong, determined, loyal and funny."
3,Pleasant reading,"This is not great, but it's a nice romance novel. The characters are interesting and likeable. Bad guys create the conflicts. Sexual content: moderate.For a list of my reviews of other books by this author, see my 4 star review of ""Sizzle and Burn"" posted 2-09-08."
3,...,"While I can say that I felt sympathy for both characters in the beginning, they both turned out to be unlikeable.Harriet was so demanding, expecting Gideon to do what she said. She ""forbade"" him from going to a duel. She literally demanded that he not do this, not go there, not think that.And Gideon was odd. He didn't defend himself in the beginning when he first got the scar, he just let everybody assume whatever they want but he never actually denies he did anything wrong in the whole situation with Deirdre and Morland. He's also ridiculously stubborn, yet patient with Harriet's demands. He obviously loved her - and yet he never says it!Then the fossil thing was so boring. It was all wrapped up in the very last pages, but by then who cares?"
1,Emptiness,"The most boring book I have ever read. Fossils, fossils blah, blah, blah and an extremely annoying leading female character. I wish I wouldn't have wasted my 10 bucks on this one."
3,"domo arigato, Yoshiki-san !! anata wa number one da !!","This tribute album is quite a disappointment, yet it made me discover one of the most talented musician I've ever heard : Yoshiki HAYASHI (leader, drummer and pianist of X-Japan !!). If you liked black diamond, buy hide's tribute album !!"
4,Awesome Sophomore Effort,"Here we have more mixing-it-up with House tracks, R&B tracks and a couple of ballads. The result is another great album. Baltimore is still well represented!"
4,Slavery examined,Although I consider myself well read in American history and found lots of worthwhile insights and explanations for things I never thought about in detail before. A good read although a little to researched and documented for the average reader
3,Do you like Thalia?,"So we were looking up tye lyrics to the Titanic theme and found a video of Minako Honda singing ""My Heart Will Go On"". Liked it, so I ordered a CD by this singer. Okay, she's Japanese, so I should not have been surprised that she sang in Japanese. Doesn't matter, beautiful music is good in any language. This is like eighties pop music and wasn't too bad, but I don't understand Japanese, which leads me to Thalia, the Mexican pop singer. I like her too but I don't understand Spanish either. Unable to understand either language, Minako and Thalia sound remarkably alike. Thinking about ordering another Minako CD. Haven't really decided. Nothing like a wishy-washy review huh? Sorry. She is cute though."
3,"Great movie, weird editing.","I specifically bought this one because I thought it included the portions other reviewers had complained were missing from earlier releases of this George C. Scott version, my all-time favorite Jane Eyre. But the gypsy fortuneteller scene is still gone--I'd love to find out what utter moron cut that part out in the first place. It's a critical scene in the book, and was so fun in this movie. Too bad. Still a good movie."
3,is ok,"it is again ok for a family gathering or a peaceful evening together... the acting is ok, the story is ok - if you like jane eyre...you might want to add this to your collection"
4,Jane Eyre,"THIS VERSION IS OVER 3 MINUTES SHORT.My wife is an avid Jane Eyre fan. She kept saying something was missing.Just happen to pick up another copy real cheap for our bedroom, and sure enough the missing scene was there--when Rochester's ward and Jane Eyre enter the library to get the present for the young girl."
1,Gave 1 star b/c wouldn't let me do none lol,"I really thought there wasn't a version of Jane Eyre that I couldn't at least like if not love. Well now I found one. I found 'Jane' to be a complete doe-eyed idiot & Rochester oh my dear Rochester... George Scott butchered the hard, ill-tempered man I have come to love. I paid $0.99 for it at Walmart but I still feel a little cheated. lol But seriously this was the worst version I have ever scene. Watch the ones with Ciaran Hinds, Timothy Dalton, or any other version!!!!"
3,"Randy Rose - ""Sacrificium""","This isn't just Danzig-influenced, it's Randy Rose trying to impersonate Glenn Danzig. That aside, I believe this record was created to try to get kids hooked on Glenn Danzig to listen to a Christian version of Danzig. It's not a bad record but it's not very honest musically because like I said, it's just an impersonation. I must say this: I've never heard another singer with enough guts to so obviously impersonate Danzig. He does a pretty good of it at some points too."
5,"Great counting book, plus.....","hey I expected this to be just another counting book, but my 3 and 4 year olds loved this book so much. We borrowed it from the library. As you turn each page 10 different colored balloons are popped one by one by very pesky birds. As each page is turned Toby the turtle tries a different form of transportation to speed away from the ""Pesky birds"". Toby is determined to get some balloons over to Tina for her birthday. Each ballon a different color, each set of pages with a new number of balloons to count. Also, each page has different critters across the bottom of the page to talk about. Toby starts out walking, but ends up in a rocket ship to get one red balloon to his friend Tina for her birthday. Very nice book. Nice thick pages. Very colorful."
4,A classic Australian cookbook,"The Australian Women's Weekly is a long established magazine in Australia that has provided generations of Australian women with home, family, gardening, cooking, fashion, entertainment advice and news - shaping and displaying the Australian culture. This cookbook is yet another of their large collection of books providing tried and tested ""never fail"" recipes, to suit any situation. This book provides recipes for any meal situation or season. A great introductory book for those interested in what is cooked ""Down Under""."
5,The Perfect Guide for Your California Dreams,"Whether your eyes are set on the tranquil coast and magestic mountains or the bright lights and big cities of California, Let's Go shares with you its invaluable insights on where to go and what to do. If it were not for this book, I would have been stuck in the overpriced hotels and unsavory eateries often suggested by Lonely Planet and other guides. Mr. Blazejewski and Ms. Hur are also adept writers and rather funny; I thoroughly enjoyed reading their prose during my flight. Overall, I think the book perfectly captures the pulse of this diverse state, and I highly recommend Let's Go California 2002."
1,"men who have walked with god, by sheldon cheney","A followup to my previous review... The writing in the book is still wonderful but the publishing is of the worst quality. It looks like the 1945 hardcover book has been photocopied and black and white stats made of the illustrations (which were black and white photographs of fine art prints). Since I own a copy of the 1945 hardcover edition, I compared page by page, and it definitely does look just like a copy job. The cover is flimsy and unattractive. I was actually wondering if it was legally published or stolen, but I don't know how to find out. The star I gave it was for the writing, not the publishing! What a shame to put out such a pitiful edition of a beautiful book."
2,Comfortable but fragile,These are very comfortable shoes and I really like the rubber soles. The problem however is that because the leather is so soft it scuffs and scrapes easily. Perhaps as a limited use shoe it would be fine but if your intent is to wear them often then look elsewhere because they won't look good for long.
4,Not for the beginning acrylic artist,"I found this book to be very helpful in experimenting with new ideas for my paintings. However, it is not for the beginning artist. This book shows various techniques but it won't show you how to paint a picture step by step"
5,A new twist,"First, I love Quiller's work and color choices so naturally I would love the fresh approach to his landscapes. It is a wonderful book to see the alternatives to the Super-realistic paintings created by most artists. It is a unique way to use color and the simplified landscapes that are the result. This book is an eye-opener to the traditional artist and should be used to expand our outlook to the outdoors and the semi-abstract genre. Heartily recommend this book."
2,One trick pony,"This book contains a good color wheel and some useful discussion about material, but that's about it. The art is extremely idiosyncratic, stylized, and modern, and it is not very appealing. What's more, it appears that the author only has command of one style/genre, and that won't be of much help people who are trying to learn. Spend your money on The North Light Book of Acrylic Painting Techniques instead."
1,Watercolor not Acrylic,"This book is really mis-named. It should be called Watercolor Painting Techniques. All the illustrations are muted, flat watercolor illustrations, not the vibrant, colorful acrylic illustrations one would expect from the title. If you are looking for a book on acrylic painting techniques, look elsewhere."
5,A master at work,"This is a great book by Stephen Quiller who is a master artist in acrylic. His books explains all about how he accomplishes that with ease. For me, the impressionistic paintings are a beauty to behold and I've admired Quiller's work for years and now I know how he does it."
2,Nineteen is NOT Thirteen,"Simply put, this movie lost me fairly quickly. For one thing, a nineteen year old cannot pass for a thirteen year old no matter how young she may look. The characteristic thirteen-year-old outbursts seems over acted when done by an adult. Then there was the utterly self centered lifestyle of all the adults.One could hardly find a family that more thoroughly and consistently violated about every traditional family value there is. If you like a believable heroine in your movies, and if you care at all about unnecessarily exposing your kids to immorality, you'd do best to skip this loser of a movie."
4,Henry and the Tunnel,"Henry, the green tender engine in the Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends series, tends to be a bit boastful about his abilities to the smaller engines. When it begins to rain, Henry lets his vanity go to his head and refuses to come out of a tunnel and risk getting rain on his lovely green paint. To teach him a lesson, Sir Topham Hatt has a wall built at the tunnel exit, forcing Henry to remain there until he changes his attitude! As days pass, Henry's green paint gets sooty and cold, and the other engines go about their business around him. Henry must then reconsider his stance, and just in time to help Gordon the Great Engine out of a real fix. This story is a wonderful one for illustrating what one misses out on by being haughty and not cooperating with others."
5,Inspirational and Encouraging,"I found this book to be quite inspirational, especially on the heels of having just read the ""Purpose Driven Life."" It reminds us that we are to take up our cross, and listen and watch daily at the Lord's door. The book encourages the reader to know Him and make Him known. These stories by Jim Cymbala, Beth Moore, Michael W. Smith, Chonda Pierce, Lee Strobel, Steven Curtis Chapman, and others; serve to challenge the Christian not only to stand firm in his faith, but also to allow time for daily reflection and rededication."
5,Experiencing the Great I am,"This book is full of inspiring stories that show that no matter how bad our situation God loves us, comforts us, and can even turn something negative into a positive if we just let him in our lives. These are stories of real people written in such a way that you immediately connect with these folks, and it gives you a peaceful and uplifting feeling. Although they are short stories, you immediately find yourself connected to these folks, and I find myself going back to re-read many of the stories.Higly recommended as inspirational reading."
2,Intrigue?,"Where was the urgency and where is the intrigue? I just didn't feel any urgency. For a twice blessed amnesiac, I expected to feel sympathetic towards the heroine; instead I felt sorry for Sam and partially for myself for finishing the book! I kept telling myself, it would pick and get better, but... was continually disappointed. Even the ending was anticlimactic. It was just all over the place as are my feelings after reading this."
4,A great read,"HERS TO REMEMBER is a story I will remember for its depth of emotions and characters. I kept putting myself in the heroine's place and wondering what I would do in the same situation -- the sign, to me, of a good story. Karen Barrett is a new voice to look for! I can't wait for her next book."
3,A little forced...,"Well written, but a little forced. The author's preconceived theory (a connection between Romero's works and the literary Naturalism inspired by Emile Zola) overwhelms almost every other aspect of his critical analysis and prevails on more objective aspects of Romero's art; not to mention the historical and documentary insight, which is very poor here. Unfortunately, Williams never doubts of his critical intuitions in this book, despite G. A. Romero himself never mentioned any link between his movies and Zola or others. Maybe a relashionship between Naturalism and Romero could have been an interesting idea, but to say that every single element of his work is probably linked to Dreiser, Zola or Norris, is really too much. Nevertherless, the book examines every single movie of Romero's filmography as far as ""Bruiser"": it is the most exhaustive (even if one-sided) critical essay about his films up to now."
2,All We've Got For Now,"George Romero is certainly a filmmaker deserving of serious consideration by film scholars. His contribution to modern cinema, good and bad, is immense. This book is the only substantial contribution to Romero scholarship to date. Unfortunately, it is horribly written. Flat, dry and repetitious. Numerous grammatical and typographical errors. So, at best, this is a problematic work for everyone. Most ""horror fans"" will be repelled by the academic tone. Most ""film scholars"" will be repelled by the poor writing and the at times forced interpretations. Nevertheless, until something better comes along, this is all we have.Mr. Williams, it should be noted, also edited a worthwhile collection of Romero essays for the University of Mississippi Press. That book includes an introduction by Williams that is just as poorly written. The kicker is that this guy is a professor at a major university. In my opinion, he should audit some classes in composition."
5,Fabulous Find for lLovers of OZ,This book is truly a celebration. Multiple writers and artists have shared what Baum's stories meant to them and how they interpret the kingdom of OZ as adults now. I first read the series as a grade school boy in the fifties and still will return to the stories from time to time. I am sharing them with my grandchildren at this time and it is such a joy to see them as captivated as I was so long ago!
