1,Why is this book even on here?,"This book teaches how to abuse your child. It's an angry, thoughtless, and degrading book that shouldn't exist. If I could give it a 0, I would. Please do NOT buy this book and follow ANYTHING these ridiculous people suggest. It is completely asinine and you'll end up seriously traumatizing your children. Please note that there have even been deaths linked to this book. If there was ever a book that needed to be burnt, it's this one."
1,They want you to beat your children,"This book represents the worst of human society. If you truly believe that hitting a kid under any circumstance, you are severely lacking in intelligence and should probably give dcfs a call so your child has a chance of a decent life and not under some kind of gorilla freak with an iq of 12."
1,HORRIBLE,"This is a HORRIBLE baby whipping manual. My cousin sent it to me telling me I would love it. I did not love it! They advocate abuse throughout the book. Spanking infants for crying! They use their children as examples of success. I dont think their children are trained as much as brain-washed. These people are horrible, and they hide behind God justifying their abuse. God is Love. God is Love. God is Love. If you believe that, don't buy this book."
4,Do the naysayers know anything about the Pearls?,"I can see how some could interpret spanking as horrible. I personally am horrified by parents who strike out at their kids in anger. But this book condemns such parental abuse. I have read many of the writings of Michael Pearl and it is clear that he is a loving and wise man who fears God. He understands that rebellion requires correction. As for spanking an infant--there is nothing of child abuse here. He advocates gentle ""swats"" as a way of making clear that certain behaviour is unacceptable. It is not the correction for rebellion, but a signal that what they are doing is not right.Don't be afraid of the Pearls. Take a look at the happy and healthy and productive kids they raised! (NGJ.org)"
5,Wonderful!,"This book has been a wonderful tool in helping me TRAIN my children. I love my children enough to correct them, not abuse them, when you loving and prayfully correct you children you will be amazed at the peace and happiness in your home, thank you Pearls for all the excellent advise!"
1,To Tear Down a Child,"If you want to have your nine year olds still peeing their pants and your tennagers struggling with self-injury, this is the book for you! If you want to raise children who hate God because you've perverted their view of Him, please, by all means, buy and use this book."
1,The pearld advocate child abuse,Not only does this book recommend something that is morally wrong but it's sometimes ILLEGAL. Whipping children and babies is WRONG!!!http://www.stoptherod.net/ttuac.html
1,These people Are Sick,"This cannot be for real. I mean if it was real, wouldn't these people have been arrested by now for child abuse and advocating the same? I cannot believe these people found a publisher! God bless any child that comes within their reach.J.M.Andrews"
1,Will this work for my wife?,"If this book says it is ok to use a switch on your children, is it ok to use the same methods on my wife? I need her to be more obedient."
5,The Only Child-Training Book You'll Need,"The Biblical child-training strategies that the Pearls endorse in this book really work! The book is written in an easy-conversational style and gives real-life examples of how to implement those strategies. The book's emphasis is on training, rather than discipline. I truly believe this is the only child-training book a parent needs. HIGHLY recommended! In fact, it is very difficult for me to keep a copy around-- I pass it along to anyone who needs it and therefore have to keep replacing my own copy. If you want happy, joyful, well-mannered children, READ THIS BOOK!"
1,"No one should waste their money, or time on this disgusting book","Amazon needs to change their rating system, so negative stars can be used. This book promotes child abuse, it is an evil book, the physical presence of this book is enough to cast a dark pall in your home."
1,abuse manual,"This book is nothing more than a manual for ways to abuse and humiliate your child. This is not a biblical method for raising children. Run far, far away from this book and the teachings of this heretic! Children have died at the hands of parents using these methods. Check out the deaths of Lydia Shatz and Sean Paddock."
1,A tragically bad example,"Parents following the tenets of this book repeatedly abused, starved, neglected and eventually killed their child. This took place in Sedro-Wooley, Washington and the parents are currently preparing to stand trial for murder. For more details on this case you read here: [...]Do not look to this book for guidance and Amazon should seriously consider removing this book from their inventory."
1,Child abuse manual,"This book is nothing more than a manual for child abuse! Beating fear into children to teach them the love of God? If I wrote a manual on how to beat fear into adults to change their beliefs/opinions/behavior, I would be arrested for inciting violence. How do these monsters get away with advocating violence towards children?Amazon, how can you be a party to this? Don't make it easier for these sadists to peddle their criminal delusions."
1,Child abuse manual,"I wonder why this book is even sold ? I checked this out of curiosity some time ago and it gave me nightmares ! These people advocate hitting an infant with a plastic tube ! Why this book is even sold on Amanzon, I do not understand. If you are a new parent, stay away from this."
1,If I must.,I don't normally rate child-abuse manuals but this one was so deserving of a low rating I figured I may as well.
1,Mr. Corbett...,"I have to say I disagree with the review Mr. Corbett gave. I am a Mom of 5 and not ""chastising by way of the Bible"" does NOT mean NOT disciplining. I do not ""chastise"" my children, and they ARE disciplined. Discipline does not mean hitting. To discipline means to teach. Perhaps you weren't aware how King Solomon's son Rehoboam turned out...he's the one who gave the advice in PROVERBS. His son turned out to be a hated ruler and terrible person. NOT someone I would take parenting advice from. Perhaps you are the one mis-understanding? It wouldn't hurt to take a closer look at things for the sake of your children. It would hurt; however, to not look more closely."
1,"Should be titled ""How to beat your child to death"" as Pearl's followers have done.","This is an instruction manual on how to beat your child with a belt, pipe, stick, or wire and blame this abuse on god.Several children whose parents followed these horrible teachings, have died.Just do an online search for Sean Paddock, Lydia Schatz, and Hana Williams.After the 2010 death of 7-year-old Lydia Schatz was linked to methods Mr. and Mrs. Pearl espouse, there was a great outcry from non-spankers and spankers alike. Michael Pearl's response to what was largely thoughtful and concerned criticism, was a blog post where he openly laughed at his critics and posted a photo of the kind of plumbing line Lydia Schatz was killed with (the kind of plumbing line he and his wife recommend as a spanking tool on their website). Such insensitivity from a man who claims to be doing the will of God, is disturbing beyond words.SEVERAL CHILDREN HAVE BEEN BEATEN TO DEATH DUE TO THE TEACHINGS OF THIS BOOK. IT'S NOT A JOKE."
1,I also know of a child who has died because of this book,"Yes, In Skagit County, WA a child was starved, beaten, and left out in the rain to freeze to death because of teachings from this book. Enough said...."
5,Only one book,"If I could only read one book on child training, then this book would be the one. I have raisedfive sons and this book was so helpful."
1,This is a criminal child abuse hadbook. Don't buy it!,The results of yhis sick book are several dead children.It advocates 'whipping' infants as young as 5 months old with PLUMBING TUBING. You should be investigated at least if you buy this trash. Arrested at best.Save your child and yourself buy NOT BUYING THIS BOOK.
1,Beating a child into unquestioning obedience?,"A well-meaning friend gave me all 4 of the To Train up a Child series. I read them, and was mostly appalled by the methods advocated. I do not want unquestioning obedience from my son. My goal is to raise a thinking, functional human being who can make decisions on his own. The very thought of needing to ""switch"" my child for evey incident of childish behavior makes me cringe. In all fairness, the Pearls do speak of loving their children and advocate ""tying heartstrings"" , i.e. always maintaining loving communication with their children. However, I do not understand how their advocated methods will achieve this. I do not understand how a child can be called a terroristic manipulator and a joy at the same time. Their methods confused me, a rational adult - how much more havoc will they wreak in the minds of our most defenseless little ones?"
1,Horrible excuse to abuse a child,"Any book that would advocate HITTING a tiny baby is NOT a book that I recommend. This is an awful excuse for a parenting book. You wouldn't hit an adult who didn't do what you said, so why hit a helpless child? DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Religion promotes abuse!,"Disgusting! Beating children in the name of an invisible sky fairy. I wish I believed in hell, as there is a place reserved for parents who practice this abuse."
1,Piece of Junk,Literary? Indeed. You would get better advice of how to raise young from an animal. You can't even call these jokers authors. They are idiots.
1,Promotes Abuse. Amazon Should Not Carry This Book.,"This book advocates child abuse. Amazon removed that horrible book promoting sexual abuse written by a ""boy lover"" - it needs to remove this one as well. Beating a child is not acceptable - ever. That' what this book recommends. Un-freaking-believable."
1,I can't believe someone could do this?,Child Abuse in its purest from. I do not believe our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ would want this book to be followed or even written.
1,Evil personified!! Not of God...of the enemy.,"I was horrified to receive this book today. I am actually going to burn it as I would hate to give it to someone else. These are NOT GODLY principles...they are evil practices. God is not in this book or behind this book and I am sure will never want to be linked to this book. I would suggest ""Dare to Discipline"" by Dr. Sears instead."
1,Horrible Book,Amazon should be ashamed to sell this book. This book encourages child abuse and has resulted in the murder of several children. I feel sorry for the children of parents who rely on this book for parenting advice.
1,"This book is not about training, it is about child abuse","This book advocates *switching* 4 month old babies. That is not discipline, training, or parenting. It is child abuse, pure and simple. Michael Pearl was on TV advocating whipping a 7 year old 10-12 lashes with a belt. I am a conservative Christian who is not opposed to spanking, but what Pearl describes is not spanking, it is beating and it is abuse. He tells parents that if they don't ""train"" their children the way he teaches, the children to grow up to be wild, perverted, and hell-bound. Millions of parents have reared children without the adversarial, punitive, and violent methods taught by Michael Pearl; children who grew up to be happy, well-adjusted, Christian adults. There is simply no need nor excuse for using the extreme violence against our children as taught by Michael Pearl. He is a sick, evil man who preys on the desire of young parents to rear Godly, well-behaved children."
1,Amazon must answer the question...,"Amazon should be ashamed for promoting child abuse in the name of ""freedom of speech"". The authors of this book have created a guide for child abuse. I am shocked that Amazon believes this is an acceptable product for public sale. What's next, ""a guide to pedophelia""?"
1,Child Abuse Manifesto,"I was shown a copy of this book by a neighbor. This book is a very well outlined child abuse manifesto written by unstable, abusive parents. These authors should be arrested and behind bars. They advocate hitting, neglecting and imo torturing infants and toddlers. Some misguided parents have taken the words of this twisted piece of trash and ""trained"" their child to death.No God wants anything to do with this. This man is self-centered, dangerous, without remorse, enjoying the power to abuse little ones.Negative five stars."
1,Incredibly depressing view of child-rearing,"This book advocates physical punishment to gain obedience and compliance. The examples and attitudes the Pearls have toward children are horrifying and make me wonder why they didn't just get a pet or robot. Although if they treated animals the way they treat their kids, they probably would have been arrested long ago. Run as fast as you can from this book!"
1,AKA How to Raise A Nazi,"Using violence to train children to obey is what will turn them into Nazis. Whipping babies who cry at bedtime? Hitting children who call for mommy? Our society's sense of justice won't allow us to treat criminals on Death Row this way, let alone tiny children whose safety is in our hands.The Pearls give Christians everywhere a bad name."
1,Horrible,I wish I could have given it 1/2 of a star! This book was used by a family who beat their child to death! The bible condones slavery and stonings so why am I surprised?
1,"Horrified by this ""Christian"" author","I was horrified by this book. The author claims that his theories on childraising and discipline come from the Bible, however, he twists the Bible to fit his theory. His isogetical interpretation of Scripture is a disgrace to the Christain community. It is also very poorly written. I honestly would doubt if Pearl even obtained highschool degree due to his writing and style. I would be leery of any author who claims total authority, as he does, on any issue, especially Child-raising. I would recommend Shepherding a Child's Heart by Tripp to Christian parents looking for a balanced conservative perspective on child-raising."
1,A how to guid for child torture. I would burn it if it wasn't an ebook.,"Amazon, seriously, do you have to sell a book that advocates torturing a child? Children have died based on the words in this book."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,"I read this book and wow, did it change both me and my child! After incorporating the techniques described, I have willing obedience and a happy, well adjusted child. As a matter of fact, she comments on other children now, and says they need to spend a week with me, and they wouldn't misbehave anymore! She feels good about herself. It works because it is the truth of God's word in action. Thank God for the Pearls."
4,"practical help, but read more than this","This was the second book I read before the birth of my first child, and was so full of helpful information that it became my favorite. We have relied on many of the principles in TTUAC to guide us in our training, and are SO grateful for the ministry of NGJ - particularly their bi-monthly newsletters. I would caution, however, that this not be the ONLY book that you read, and that you not compare your ""results"" with the book. I have found, after years of listening to the Pearls, that they understand CHILDISHNESS, and urge parents to ENJOY their children. So, be discerning; but truly this is a great resource.CAUTION: If you have anger issues, don't read this book! This book is about disciplining in LOVE, not venting your emotions on your child."
1,This book reads like sado-masochistic child pornography,Was this book written by and for sex offenders? It sure reads like it was written by perverts. There is scenario after scenario of beating and dominating children. For 'offenses' as innocent as not playing when 'commanded'. Really freaking creepy.
1,For the lazy and ignorant,"Those who have children and have no understanding or desire to understand the real needs and natural development of children, these people give you an easy answer to how to discipline. Drill them with dog training-like commands, and when that fails, hit them with a ""rod."". Don't worry, it's OK. It's in the Old Testament. For the lazy and the ignorant, this is welcome advice, until they get caught or worse; they really go too far and injure or kill the child. Come on! It is Christian to hit a child with a piece of plumbing? Is that OK to do to your husband or wife when they displease you?"
1,DISGUSTING,"This book is the reason parents have beat their children literally to death. 911 was called to the home of a child who died choking on her own vomit while being beaten. They found she had the bruisings covering her body usually of that of a victim of an explosion. Violence is never the answer ever for any reason and training a child by beating them with a stick or rod, belt whatever is sick, disgusting and downright wrong. I am also disappointed that Amazon would sell this book and I want to see it removed. The authors are a couple who enjoy control and abuse - they beat children all the while smiling and quoting or misquoting the bible. People please, despite your beliefs, remember those who preach what they think they know, afterall are humans just like me and you. Humans are inaccurate in their interpretations of God and the bible, trust your own heart. Think about when you were a child, is it really ok to beat a child? It's maddening."
1,child abuse is amoral not to mention against the law,"Shame on Amazon for promoting a book on child abuse! As others have stated, this book is not based on scripture, but rather criminal behavior - abuse of power and control over helpless children."
1,Zero Stars,"Wow...this is scarey stuff. They speak about training a child in a way I would not train a dog. I'm afraid the advise in this book will lead to children being abused. They speak of smacking a 5 month old who arches his back when you place him in his carseat....enough said. Please don't follow this ""method""...don't do this to your children."
1,OMG!,"Horriffic!!! Just one expamle of this madness: this book encourages to use a one foot long stick to beat children who are less than one year old!Seriously WTF!Only one thing, that comes to my mind: ""Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."" Luc 23:34"
2,book,"Read with wisdom and discernment and a good, working knowledge of child development. A study of the Hebrew meaning of words used in the Bible would be helpful as well. Arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner."
1,"Amazon should have 0 Stars possible, even just for this ONE book.","Oh my goodness...I can't believe this book exists :( Heartbreaking to think that there's kids out there suffering the 'techniques' the authors support to gain compliance above all else.Here's my FAVORITE review of this book, which includes MANY actual excerpts, and exactly why to NEVER considering using it's techniques on ANY child: http://www.quicksilverqueen.com/2011/to-train-up-a-child-chapter-1-part-2/"
1,The road to Hell is paved with good intentions and twisted bible quotes,"I am alarmed and disgusted that Amazon continues to sell this book. I feel Amazon is neglecting its corporate responsibility by profiting off a book that advocates corporal punishment with the use of a weapon as a reasonable mode of teaching positive behavior to a child. Once again a child has died because of the methods taught in this book and by continuing to sell a book advocating physical, emotional and psychological abuse and neglect Amazon is as culpable as the sadist who wrote it and the misled parents who use it. Amazon, where do you draw the line between free speech and collusion with a crime?"
1,It's child abuse period.,It's child abuse. Amazon should remove this from stores immediately; else risk losing loyal customers!!!Children are not Circus animals for God sake!
1,Sick and abusive,"This book should be pulled from Amazon, especially in light of the current story about the poor baby who died as a result of her parents following the ""teachings"" of this book.It is sick. Violence breeds violence. Hug your kids, don't hit them."
1,Child Abust 101,"This book is nothing more than an instructional on child abuse. Any book that reccommends spanking a 4 mo baby, on bare skin no less, should be banned."
1,How horrible.,"I have never believed it was okay to hit people, and children are people as well. For the record, I have two boys under the age of three, whom I have never had to hit or ""train"" in order for them to do what is expected of them at home. Previous reviews have derided Dr. Sears and those who use attachment parenting, but I have to say that I love it. My boys are well behaved and polite, and I have been blessed with a rich, rewarding relationship with them that has been built on a strong foundation of trust. I can only imagine that using the techniques described in this book would shatter that precious trust. It sickens me to think that some people might even consider doing this to their children. I strongly encourage anyone looking for guidance in their parenting to reject this book and look instead at the principals of attachment parenting. Really, the best evidence is in some of the responses from people praising the Pearls: hardened, defensive, and just plain nasty."
1,"Terrible, sickening book",I could barely finish this book without crying. It made me sick to my stomach to read how to abuse a child.
1,Appalling,I can't believe people are buying books that promote child abuse and don't think amazon should be selling it.
1,This book is so sad.,It grieves my heart to think that this is being taught in the name of Jesus. Their use of scripture is so wrong in so many places I can't believe they would publish it. Not even sure what to say. I don't think I've ever read anything so heartbreaking.
1,Harsh,"Whipping babies with switches - that's inhumane. There is no one-size-fits-all formula to parenting. Mr. Pearl would have us believe that his methods produce children that obey instantly, with every parental command. Any parent who's raised even one child knows that children are never, always obedient, every single time. Even the most mild mannered, obedient kids mess up once in awhile. Don't waste your time with this book, or any other of the Pearl's publications."
1,You have got to be kidding!!,"ANY book that reinforces the notion that it is O.K. to hit(spank) children is ignoring the current research and the teachings of the new testament.I am totally appalled at the review from J Witt who uses the example of her own child's reaction to the harsh discipline used. Her child would have given up with or without the spanking. Telling her Momma ""I love you."" for the first time in the morning is not an indication that this kind of discipline was good for her but an indication that she wanted to know that she was still loved after the violent punishment from the person she loves.If how our children turn out is an indication of how well a discipline method works and we can prove that children disciplined without spanking can turn out just as well as those who are not; Why would you choose a method that physically hurts the child you love?"
1,Say No to the beating of children,"This book should never have been published, It is in NO way the way Christans parent. This book is gross and is nothing more then crap. Common sense says you dont beat a baby with a pole. If you do get this book as yourself this question first. Would I go and hit my neighbor if they did something that I didnt approve of? Think about it you go to jail if you hit your spouse or neighbor what makes you think its a good idea to hit your BABY?"
1,These authprs condone wife abuse as well,"If you read Created to be His Helpmeet, you will find the Pearls think it is fine for a man to abuse his wife. The wife must endure the abuse in silence(do not report it) becuse in so doing, she brings glory to God. If she does report it, she is rebellious and does not fullfil the role God had for her."
1,Alternate title should be: Child Abuse How To Manual!,"This book is completely disgusting and should be banned, free speech or not! Anyone who advocates beating (""switching"") an infant (or any child regardless of age) is a sick and twisted individual! I can't believe anyone would actually consider following the methods listed in this book. If it wa possible I'd give this book zero stars, one star is way too many."
1,I'm not for censorship in any form...BUT,"If I were, this book would be at the top of the list. I am still just heartbroken after reading this book. Please raise your children with love and affection, not train them as you would a dog or horse. I'm not known for being short on words, but this book has me speechless.This book is a book telling you how to abuse your children. Please think before you hit.."
1,This Book Is Horrifying,"Oh my God. What an upsetting book! And even more upsetting that certain people like and approve of it! More horrifying still -- that they practice what it preaches on their own little ones! I read a lot of talk about so-called Christian values. I do not think Jesus would approve of this book. He was a sweetheart. He suffered the little children to come unto him and said that if anyone hurt them, it was better for the abusers to have a millstone tied around their necks and be cast into the sea. Look it up. It's right there in the Bible.Also, you might wanna check out a little New Testament: Matthew 25:40. Whatever you do to them, you have done it unto our Lord. Do you really want to whip Jesus? If not, don't buy this book. And if you have a weak stomach, don't read any of the excerpts on line. They will sicken you."
1,"A ""How To"" Guide For Abusive Parents","On CNN, the ""author"" of this garbage described how beating an 8-year-old boy with plumbing supplies who slugged his sister is an effective way to teach the child that violence is wrong. Really?? He broke my irony meter. No doubt the two grumps behind this garbage book will praise God for these negative reviews, believing this is persecution for being a Saint...when in reality, they are being derided for publishing a ""How To"" guide book for methodic and intentional child abuse. Raising 5 kids does not make one an expert on child raising anymore than owning 5 cars necessarily makes one an expert on auto repair."
1,Unbiblical FILTH,"The Pearls will answer to God for leading so many people astray. People using their ""training"" methods have KILLED children. Not only should you NOT read it, you should BURN any copies you are unfortunate enough to stumble across."
1,Great book if you want to end up in jail or lose your kid to the state,"What's advocated here is child abuse, and is illegal. If you see evidence that child you know is being treated this way, you are legally obligated to report it in most states. Why Amazon would sell this dangerous piece of fanatical propaganda is beyond me."
4,Training with love,"This review is in response to all the poor reviews. I have read this book and follow a few of it's concepts to lead my daughter into safety and self control. This book DOES NOT condone any beating, whipping, etc. of any child at any time. It teaches a training method to teach a child at a young age to respect a parents requests. In chapter 4, creating fellowship with our children is the most important aspect, as is teaching respect for others. Again, this book DOES NOT condone beatings, whippings, etc."
1,Awful book that advocates abuse,"The things suggested in this book make me shudder. The author shows a complete lack of knowledge of child development. Under no circumstances is physical punishment of infants appropriate. The methods for dealing with older children are also nothing short of abuse. There is nothing Biblical or Christian about beating your child into submission. For a more truly Christian perspective on parenting, try The Complete Book of Christian Parenting & Child Care by Dr. William Sears. Unlike the author of To Train Up a Child, Dr. Sears actually understands child development (he is a pediatriation) AND the Bible. PLEASE avoid To Train Up A Child at all costs."
1,Positively horrific,"Things I've learned from reading just the first chapter of this book at the Pearls' Web site -- if you don't believe me, check it out for yourself by searching for ""No Greater Joy"":* Place appealing objects within reach of toddlers, then ""switch"" (aka smack) their hands when they reach for them.* If your nursing baby bites your breast, pull his hair.* Newborns cry to be manipulative.* Training children is just like training animals. (I have to wonder, then, why the Pearls advocate hitting children, when the vast majority of dog trainers don't advocate hitting dogs. I've never once laid a hand on my dog all through her training, and she is perfectly well-behaved.)There may be a few positives about this book, but I would never in a million years support these authors by buying anything of theirs."
1,How To Train Up A Child,this book needs to be taken off the shelves of all bookstores and online stores. It has been linked to child abuse cases where the children have DIED! Please do not purchase this book!
1,To Train Up a Child,"Just a quick note, the murder of several children have been associated with this book, its basically a how to on how to torture and murder a child, and the worst part is that this book hides under the veil of religion, what a joke."
1,misunderstanding the shepherd tools..true work of the devil,"This book is a a creation of man's will not the bible! THE ROD was never meant to punish the flock of the Lord...PLEASE read and understand...that ""sparing the rod""... meant not PROTECTING one's children.""The shepherd's tools were his rod and staff. The rod was a straight wooden stick with aknob at the end and was carried in the shepherd's belt. Used as a weapon to protect theflock from predators the rod was a lethal weapon and skilled shepherds could even flingthe rod short distances to strike down predators that threatened the flock. The staff wasalso wooden and had that familiar hook like crook at the top. Sheep would quite oftenwander off the path of safety and become entangled in dense brush or slip into smallgulleys and the crook enabled the shepherd to reach out for the sheep and draw it out ofharm and back to the safety of the flock"""
1,Abusive and sickening,"It is amazing that in today's world, this book is still being sold in mainstream outlets.This author is abusive and I am horrified that anyone would even read such drivel.Do NOT bother with this book; it is nothing more than a training manual for abusers."
1,Really terrible,"Really terrible book. I recommend not following the advice in this book. It has lead to the death of children. There should be negative stars, if there was I would give it a negative five star rating."
1,Despicable!!!,"This has got to be one the worst parenting books I have ever seen. It is also one of the best examples of how to twist a holy texts words and ruin a child. If you want your child to understand that the biggest, strongest person is always right, buy this book. If you want your child to understand that he who has the weapon makes the rules, buy this book. If you want your child to understand that the application of violence to achieve one's goals, repeatedly if the desired result is not immediately obtained, is a valid way of interacting with others, buy this book.Let me make this clear to you as a parent myself (3 well adjusted, college attending kids who never were physically punished)do not buy this book and allow these sadist authors to get any of your money. This book is a guide to blatant child abuse via physical and mental torture!!!"
1,To Beat Up a Child,"This book should be renamed, ""To Beat up a Child"". The methods of so called ""training"" constitute child abuse."
1,Evil,"Imagine Jesus with a 10 month old child. Now imagine Jesus hitting that child with an 18 inch piece of weed trimmer wire because she wants her mother to pick her up. What Bible are you reading, Mr. Pearl?"
1,News Related Article: Child Abuse by readers of this book,"Did Hana's parents 'train' her to death?The deaths of the three children each allegedly happened at the hands of their parents. Though they lived in different parts of the country, the parents all had several things in common: They adopted children, home-schooled them and beat them with quarter-inch plastic tubes. They also followed the child-rearing teachings of a Tennessee evangelist, Michael Pearl, and his wife, Debi.[...]"
1,How to kill a child thru abuse is what this book should be named,Three chidren have died as a result of the methods used in this book. See the MSNBC website for the most recent death of a child. This book needs to be removed from all book stores immediately.
1,Horrifying,This book is criminal. Please reconsider buying it. This man encourages abuse. Several families claiming to be following the guidance in this book have since MURDERED their children. There are thousands of titles out there to take parenting advice from that are not connected to abuse and murder. Go find one of those.
1,Child Abuse,Readers of this book have been arrested for homicide by abuse by using methods suggested by the author. Draw your own conclusions. [...]
1,DISGUSTING,This is a book of child abuse not discipline it needs to be taken off the shelves. How many more children have to die because of this book? I don't get it with all of the child abuse going on why would anyone even allow this book to be published.
1,Don't buy this book!,"This book presents an appallingly cruel and rigid child-raising system that is bound to fail when it comes to raising happy, healthy children. The author claims to be a Christian, but if he were to come face-to-face with Jesus, Jesus would have things to say sbout why you don't maltreat and mislead children (Luke 17:2), and about outer darkness if you do. Certainly this is no Christian treatise on child-raising, just one deeply warped man's sick ideas about the subject. If you love your children, and care what happens to all children, don't waste your money on this travesty of pedagogy! Don't support this cruel, vicious tract for sadistic ""caretakers of children."" And, amazon.com, you should be ashamed of yourselves for selling this disgusting book on your website, or even making it available there free to download!"
1,HIT an INFANT?!,"An infant - a person with no ability to speak - cries to communicate. The authors of this book advocate causing physical pain in response to an infant's cries. What that teaches the infant: communication with your parent will bring pain, don't bother trying. I am horrified."
1,Sick!,Why is Amazon still selling this book? This book promotes child abuse and cruelty to children! This is sick!
1,DISGUSTING Child Abuse Manual,"I read of the tragic murder of Hana Williams who was starved and left outside to freeze to death by her parents who are followers of the ""teachings"" in this horrible book. I have read excepts from this book online and cannot believe there are people so sick as to ""discipline"" their babies who bite their mother's nipple while breastfeeding (the remedy: yank the baby's hair) and who use a switch (who even uses that word?!) on babies as young as 4 months old.This book is telling parents it's good parenting to beat their children for the slightest offense. I can't believe Amazon (or any bookstore) would sell such disgusting garbage.This book is being promoted by sick, sadistic people many of whom identify themselves as homeschoolers and ""good Christians"". These people apparently have no ability to think for themselves and are in desperate need of mental health assistance. Their poor poor children.AMAZON - WHY ARE YOU PROMOTING THIS GARBAGE??!!!"
1,The worst parenting book I have ever read.,"I have 4 children and we are adopting 2 more. I was given this book by a mom that fully believed and practiced it on her elementary and middle school children. She even tried to train (without hitting) my children while I mistakenly left them at her house. Several years later and all of her kids and her are a total mess, their family is broken and their kids are making some really bad choices. Even if you took out the harsh spanking you still have a really bad book. The way they view children is hard to stomach and read. There are other more balanced Christian books, I am sad that someone is making money off of this book."
4,To Train Up a Child,"I read this book long before I was married and long before I had children. When my husband and I were expecting our first baby I picked up all the child training books we had and read them, including this one. This is one of the best that I've read so far. There is absolutely nothing that speaks of abuse in this book. While I don't agree with everything (such as potty untraining), the bulk of the book is excellent material. A careful read, taking all things within the context of the whole, there is no way one could come to the conclusion that the Pearls advocate child abuse."
1,Child Abuse,"There are no 0 for stars and I did want to leave my written shock at finding a book that encourages child abuse.The ROD? I thought there were laws to protect children from this kind of abuse, but I guess making money out of it is okay.""if you have to sit on him to spank him, then do not hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are bigger, tougher."" <snip> ""Defeat him totally.""""Him"" being a child. It's quite hard to grasp the concept."
1,How terribly saddening,"I cannot believe that people are using a ""parenting"" style of TRAINING their children as if they were dogs. As a matter of fact, this is an outdated method to train dogs. I was crying as I read pieces of this book. I am also disgusted that reputable book dealers are selling a manual on child abuse. Are our children Pavlov's dogs?! Have the pearl's taken 1 class on child development? I am outraged and disgusted and am not sure I will rest well until something is done to prevent parents from abusing their children my practicing this ""child training"" method of parenting."
1,Book on the Bible ok's child abuse,Oh my God. Remove this hatefuldelusional book on child abuse ASAP. This is outrageous for Amazon to post. Bible sure does mess up everything as usual.jk
1,"Should be called ""How to systematically abuse a child""","This book is the most shocking book I have ever come across. It should be banned and should not be sold on Amazon - by selling this book they are condoning it. Freedom of speech ends when it causes the abuse of innocent children who have no voice of their own. The principles in this book stem from true evil - and what is worse is that they are dressed up as the will of God.Please Amazon, ban this author."
1,AWFUL! Avoid this book at all costs!,"These people are animals encouraging others to whip and beat their children. They have no credentials to speak of and I'm amazed they even got this published. Don't allow them to convince you this is ok; it ISN'T!Just remember this: children are people too and they deserve love and respect just like all others. In fact, they need it the most because they are so helpless."
5,The best parenting book ever!,This was the most helpful book i have ever read! It has helped me to raise 3 wonderful well behaved boys who love Jesus with all their hearts! I am buying it for all my friends having children!
3,love it or hate it,"I dont agree with this book completely however just because the author is telling you to spank your child doesnt mean you need to follow what he says. there are some very interesting points to this book and I think its worth reading. am I going to do what this book is telling me ...NO, but I have learned a lot just by reading it with an open mind. I do think it is important to train your child right from the beginning but it is okay for children to make mistakes! It is part of growing up and learning!"
1,Christians! don't bite your children!,"Christians! don't bite your children! And if you do read this book, at least take it with a huge grain of salt!"
1,Pure vileness,"Those who practice what is written in this book should be locked up for child abuse. The book instructs readers on the appropriate object with which to beat their one-year-old, as if beating a one year old with ANYTHING including your open hand is not child abuse. This is what the book advises-""Any spanking to effectively reinforce instruction, must cause pain. Select your instrument according to the child's size. For the under one-year-old child, a small, ten-to twelve-inch-long willowy branch (stripped of any knots that might break the skin) about one-eighth inch in diameter is sufficient. Sometimes alternatives have to be sought. A one-foot ruler, or its equivalent in a paddle, is a suitable substitute. For the larger child, a belt or a three-foot cutting off a shrub is effective.""If you are sick enough to buy this book and follow this advice, you have no business raising children."
1,"Child abuse, plain and simple! Beat your newborn!","How about some highlights from this disgusting book... you'll see what I mean.They recommend pulling a nursing infant's hair on page 7 and on page 9 they suggest whipping infants only a few months old, on their bare skin! They even describe whipping their own 4 month old daughter!!I've never felt so repulsed in my life and I can't believe Amazon would even sell this book. Don't buy this. It's a detailed manual for child abuse and every cent spent to buy this garbage encourages the further mistreatment of children."
1,Sick,This book is SICK!! These people should be arrested and prosecuted for life in prison fo rdoing this to a child.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book contradicts the best wisdom of pediatricians, child psychologists, and loving parents. Smiling while you beat your child with a stick does not keep it from being abusive, nor does the timid complacency of a terrified child count as ""good behavior."" Your child should love you and respect you, but not fear you. Do not allow this dangerous book into your home."
3,to train up a child,"As with anything, things can be taken to an extreme. Read about a child that died from this teaching.[...]The fruit of this teaching is NOT Biblical - unless one considers a dead child a good child."
5,Absolutely delightful,"How I wish this book had been written when we were raising our children. It is so down to earth, simple and humorous that anybody could be helped by it IF they would apply the wisdom in it. We use it now with our grandchildren and think every young couple should read it. We have given away scores of them. Absolutely delightful."
1,So sad ...,"I wish there was negative star ratings for this book!I was given this book when my oldest was born ... sad to say I followed some of the abuse set in it. Some things, like blanket training I could NOT do! I could not ""whip"" a four month old. I have to say that my oldest, now coming up eight years, is very insecure, fearful and clingy! I attribute this to the way we raised her in her early years.This book should be banned! It is not good parenting it is Child Abuse!!!"
1,Child abuse is illegal and wrong,If you want your children to live in fear of you then this is the book for you and your family. Beating children for any reason only proves you are a weak piece of scum and you don't deserve to live. Jesus didn't teach beating children. That is a fact. I think it is safe to say that I will see all of you promoters of violence and hatred in the afterlife hahahah
5,"Excellent Book, Written By Successful Parents","This book has helped and hundreds and hundreds of parents to finally truly love and enjoy their children. Your children will go from baby to toddler to teenager respecting you and being a friend.Those who have a negative view are probably one or more of the following:-you don't have more than one child-you don't have any children-you haven't defined what is successful parenting-you haven't read the book in it's entirety-you scream at your children (to scream at your child IS abusive - you are not in control of your tongue - one of the most dangerous weapons)-you believe it is the child's right to do anything, the child is in control -not the parent.-you believe that laws are only good for adults, you obey better than your children will ever have too."
1,Child Abuse Encouraged in this Book,"The authors of this book encourage hitting babies under 12 months old with a rod!!! How's this parenting advice?This book clearly encourages parenting through beatings, fear, disrespect of the child and plain abuse."
1,horrific,I think the title said it all. I am officially banning Amazon.com until they ban selling books instructing parents on how to abuse children.
5,I wish I would have read this sooner!!,"Micheal Pearl is an awesome Preacher/teacher & Author. If you read this book you will read he loves children & his training techniques are very wise. I would NEVER think of ""beating"" my children after reading this book. I was ""beaten"" by my step-father as a child and I would never never never ""beat"" my children!! I know the difference! This book does not teach you to hurt your children. It teaches you to love them. A MUST READ!!!!! Please read it before you judge!"
1,"DON""T GET THIS BOOK",This book has been linked to three fatalities of children whose parents (I use the term loosely) used the techniques in this book. What ever happened to loving our kids. If your husband beat you with a plastic pipe he would go to jail why is it ok to do that to defenseless children.[...]
1,child abuse,"Shame on these people for advocating child abuse. Children are a gift these people do not deserve. Hitting babies? Come on! Where is Child Protective Services when you need them? I hope there's a special hell for this couple where all the victims of their manual of abuse take turns ""correcting"" them."
1,Pretty good!,"Having rad this book for myself, I can honestly say that it's pretty good. There are some things that I found to be dangerous and over the top, such as how they trained their children to avoid the pond in the yard or suggesting that a parent sit on a child who is fleeing the punishment. But if you use common sense, temperance and prayerfully choose what you are going to apply for yourself, it is a book worth purchasing!I have started applying the training to my 10 month old and it works, exceptionally well and there is more to it than spanking, switching or the like.Read it for yourself before you formulate an opinion."
5,"I've read this book, and it does NOT promote child abuse.","This book absolutely does NOT promote child abuse, in fact, it warns against it. It teaches disciplining with love and self-control. Those who have resorted to abuse with it are not self-controlled. They are disciplining in anger. There is a HUGE difference. The Pearls teach consistency and offering fun family times and encouragement to replace negative activities. The Pearls cannot be faulted for those who've misused their authority."
4,Thank you Amazon,"For carrying contraversial books.I do not follow every part of this book, although I do believe in setting boundries and in punishing children for disobediance. There is a modified versoin for parents who cannot/will not spank their children. I do not conduct ""training sessions"" for my children, but I do not yell abuse to those who do.The people who post poory informed and false things about a book should be ignored.I think that this book is a very good begining place for people to begin child behavior studies. But I did not give it 5 stars because it can be misused, like most forms of knowledge. I recomend reading the book andusing it as you see fit for your willingness to be strong, consistant and very active in a childs life."
5,Best parenting book for BIBLE BELIEVING CHRISTIANS,"If you are a conservative, Bible believing Christian, this is the best book you will ever read on child training. I don't think I have ever read a book from an author who loved and enjoyed his children more than Pearl. His children are adults now and have written about how they adore their father."
1,Criminal abuse masquerading as parenting advice,"This book, which advocates swaddling young children so tightly they cannot move and whipping them with plumbing lines should not be called a parenting book. The Pearls do a grevious disservice to all xtians by trying to justify their terror tactics with scripture."
1,toss it in the bin!,"While there were a few valid points in this book, I found it way too extreme. I am not against spanking, but could never, in good faith, recommend this book to anyone. This book was given to me by someone at church, and my copy ended up in the trash..."
1,children have died. PLEASE find another way!,"Children have died (Sean Paddock, Lydia Schatz). Parents have hurt the persons they love most in the world. Parenting is hard. There are other ways that will not leave you both scared for life. BOYCOTT this book and movement. Find other resources PLEASE!!!!"
1,If this is your idea of raising a child...,", please consider adopting to someone else. A child deserves love, protection from harm, and guidance. Discipline is something completely different from punishment. This book advises to not bother to try to help your child learn self-disciple, but use constant punishment instead. It is appalling and should not be promoted by a trusted company like amazon."
1,A child abuse manual!,"Do not buy ""To Train Up a Child!""It reads like a child abuse manual. Throughout the book, the Pearls recommend whipping infants and young children on their bare skin. They do this for ""obedience training,"" and compare it to training a dog or mule to obtain ""instant, unquestioning obedience.""They insist ALL children need to be whipped with a ""rod."" They clearly dislike babies, calling them ""tyrants"" ""terrorists"" ""whining, spoiled brats"" and ""devious"", with ""criminal minds."" According to the Pearls' sick thinking, babies are determined to make parents' lives ""as miserable as possible."""
1,Terribly bad parenting,Please pull this book from your inventory. Child abuse and child killing should never be sanctioned. This is a terrible book with a terribly destructive message.
1,Advocates child abuse!!,This book is disgusting and appalling. These people have no clue how to raise children; they simply want to subjugate them. They advise parents to abuse their children and quote Bible verses to try and justify it. Discipline need not be carried out by beating your child. This book has no place in any parent's bookshelf. Do yourself a favor and check out Dr. Sears instead.
1,WHO WOULD PUBLISH THIS???,"what sort of lunatics would write or even publish this horrible book??????? i never bought the damm book, but if a kid got killed, i dont WANT to read it. Oh yeah, you people who LIKE this book need to realize that a family that used this book and methods killed their adoptive daughter who ""died a death of 1,000 lashes"". yeah, lets all make the world a ""better"" place by whipping our children. the children you love that, those of you who use this book for good intentions need to stop and think that you may end up killing a person. the adopted girls blood sister asked the parents in court ""why did you adopt my sister? to murder her?"". really, how could people support the authors of the book by buying it. DONT buy the book. DONT kill a child.(and if i have offended anybody, remember amazon asks you to share your opinion and im not going to sugar coat a death)"
1,Linked to deaths of 2 children,"This book promotes ""breaking the spirit"" of ""rebellious"" children. When breaking a child's spirit becomes more important than establishing love and trust, disaster ensues. Two adopted children whose parents used this as their primary source of information about disciplining children ended up killing those children. Children who need help, understanding, and loving discipline are instead being abused and broken."
1,A Criminal Book for Criminal People.,"What this book advocates constitutes torture, and is illegal in every democratic and free nation in the world. Its practices aren't compatible with Christianity in any way, and if you believe yourself to be a follower of Jesus Christ you will fight against this book in whatever way you can. That's really all that needs to be said. God bless."
1,May produce obedience but at what cost?,The people who give glowing reviews of this book remind me so much of my mother. She was so happy about how well spanking worked and she really believed it was a good thing. The problem is that the negative effects are shoved underground and are likely not to emerge until teenage-hood or adulthood. When you teach someone that deliberate physical pain is a healthy way to control unwanted behavior you to teach them to use violence on others and on themselves.When the goal of parenting is breaking a child's will there aren't the ordinary safeguards in place. Children have died because of this book's teachings.
2,Think twice about this one.,"I am not basing my opinion merely on this book,I have went to the authors website and looked up tipshe has for raising a child, and I was horrified by whatI saw. The methods he had made the child seem as if it was acriminal. I felt the methods were intended to break the child'sspirit and that did not sit well with me. If you still want to readthis, please; do so at your own discretion and think for yourself.Do not just base your parenting off a book, because everyone has theirown ways of raising their children. I find the best way is to use loveand gently reinforce children and teach your children respectand good behavior without the use of abuse. Abuse while effective,has quite the impact on a child's outcome. Many children have beenemotionally damaged by abuse, and in the long run it does more harm thangood. Love your children, treat them right, teach them goodthings and let them blossom into wonderful, loving adults."
1,A Primer for Child Abuse -- disgusting!,"Amazon should remove this book from the site. It is an absolute disgrace in terms of child development and education, and reflects badly on Amazon.This book gives guidelines for child abuse, pure and simple. It has nothing to do with bringing up and educating a well adjusted child. The Pearl ""methods"" have already been associated with several child deaths, and the parents involved have been prosecuted and convicted. Those particular parents followed the advice in this book to the extreme, but even a milder interpretation of the guidelines will be extraordinarily destructive.Please do not buy this book or follow its recommendations."
1,"Horrible advice, ungodly in every way - shockingly ignorant and cruel","Should be a choice for no stars at all! This book may claim to be be based on ""biblical"" precepts, but it is by no means a Christian way to treat anyone, much less a helpless child. Can you imagine Christ advising the beating of children to prevent misbehavior, much less for teaching them anything about life and joy and love? This author is deranged and a control freak, I cannot believe Amazon sells a book that advocates abusing children and keeping them away from even a Christian school, lest they be corrupted. The real motive is too keep control of the child in every way, mentally and physically, lest someone discover the abuse. He advises that beatings commence in infancy for crying: ""The rod is not to be used only for punishment (after the fact) but for training (before the fact).""What a creep!SHAME ON ANY BOOKSTORE THAT SELLS THIS BOOK!!"
1,Shouldn't Be Purchased; Shouldn't Be Sold,To Train Up A Child is now partially responsible for the death of a child. It has been cited in police documents regarding the arrest of a Washington couple who allegedly starved and abused their adoptive daughter resulting in her death. The local police department noted that it has been affiliated with other child abuse cases throughout the U.S.A..
1,This book should be banned,"I think my title says it all. I cannot fathom whipping a four month old baby with a willow switch, or pulling a baby's hair. Under no circumstances is this acceptable and I cannot believe that this book got published in the first place. It's a how-to guide to abuse children and disgusts and baffles me that anyone would read this and apply the methods described within in their own family."
5,praise for the Pearls,"I bought these books for my daughter when she had her 2 boys. They have been a tremendous help to her, and life in her world is much improved when she stays consistent and applies the common sense Biblical approach to raising and TRAINING her sons. She has acknowledged to me that the biggest problem in their home is HER! She knows that if she would remain consistent, things would flow much smoother. I LOVE these books and have read them myself before giving them to her. There is absolutely NO CHILD ABUSE on ANY of the pages- correction and discipline YES, but NOT abuse! I believe too many people are relying on their own understanding/wisdom instead of trusting Him and His ways for training children: ""Trust in YHVH with ALL your heart and lean NOT on your own understanding. In ALL your ways, acknowledge Him and He will direct your path."" I HIGHLY recommend their books!"
1,To Train Up a Serial Killer,I think the title should be changed to the above so that one may see the true end result. This little instruction manual is absolutely disgusting and the publisher should be embarrassed.
1,"A ""how-to"" book on child abuse","This is a child abuse instruction manual, and it makes my heart heavy to know that there are people out there following the advice from this book. I was depressed for days after reading it. If I ever personally witnessed someone following the precepts of this book with their baby, I would call the police. I asked Amazon.com to stop selling this book, but they refused."
1,How to beat up your child,"Even IF the deaths of Sean Paddock, Lydia Schatz, and Hana Grace-Rose Williams were not linked to this odious tome of religious sanctioned child abuse I could never recommend it with a clear conscience. I couldn't live wondering if my recommendation of a book espousing the beating of children, no matter what twisted ideology condoned it, led to the harm of a child which this book will surely do. If you're so sadistic you feel the need to abuse someone then why not pay for the privilege at a local S&M club? If you don't now of one write to the authors of this book for directions. They'll know."
1,Please Run From These Authors,"They have twisted the love and discipleship that Jesus modeled for us into manipulation and infliction of pain on helpless babies. They ignore AAP guidelines and put the health of babies at risk. They focus on outward obedience at all costs, forcing children to bury their emotions and put on a happy face--regardless.Following these authors' advice will teach your children that God is punitive and vengeful. It will encourage your children to deny their emotions and individuality. It will teach them to get away from their parents at the earliest possible age to experience a breath of freedom.Ask yourself how you like to be treated and discipled. Not like this!"
4,A must for every young family!,"Do you ever wonder what you could do for those poor frustrated parrents in the grocery store that just can't seem to get their children under control? Now you have an answer! get a couple copies of this book, keep them in your car, and be loving and bold enough to give those parrents a copy. I have seen the material in this book change the lives of young families. Get it, read it, understand it, then use it. The Pearls present a wonderful solution to the very complex problems of raising our children in today's world. ..."
1,Unacceptable in today's world,"Maybe centuries ago this book would not seem so outlandish, but in today's world where we have done thousands of studies on children and we know what is and isn't good for them, this is outrageous. First of all, you shouldn't need a book to teach you how to parent. Parenting is different for every individual. Secondly, children are not circus animals that you beat when they misbehave so that your friends will tell you what a tame child you have. We must teach our children to solve conflicts and problems with our thoughts and our words, not with violence. Parents who beat their children because they do not know how to get their children to behave are demonstrating that violence solves problems. ""There is no way to peace, peace is the way."" -Ghandi"
1,Why Is This Book Being Sold Here?,The report of how a child died at the hands of parents who used this book should be enough to remove this book.
1,Child Abuse How-To,"This book is definitely NOT a pearl. It is a manual in how to create drones in the service of the lord! Taunting babies to repeat undesirable behaviors, then causing them ""minor pain"" accompanied by a verbal ""no"" is the beginning of the so-called training the pearls would have godly parent utilize with their children. Further, the father is the ""general"" of the army with mother as his trusty ""aid"" in this war of subjugating the monstrous children god has provided them. All we need is a misogynist and his submissive teaching the world how to ""train"" their charges! I am disgusted that Amazon offers this book for sale and will order nothing else from them until it is removed."
1,Why do they publish rubbish?,"Any book that equates rearing children with training an animal should be banned. Children are not animals. They are humans, people - ask yourself if you would like to be treated in that manner! Geesh people! If it were reported that ANIMALS were treated in that manner, any number of humane agencies would be ALL OVER IT! This is disgusting and disturbing. If you choose to read it, do so with EYES WIDE OPEN and the Spirit leading you. Dig into the scripture and see how out of context things are and how twisted they made them! It makes me shudder to think that people can honestly think any of this is good! <shudder>"
1,"Kewords: Child abuse, child abuse, child abuse","Keywords: Child abuse, child abuse, child abuse. Why does Amazon sell this book?"
1,This is bad parenting advice,The parenting techniques advocated in this book are clearly abusive and this is a shameful book to be selling.
1,This book is nauseating!,"I feel physically ill from the thought that anyone would whip their baby at all, much less for the minor transgressions Mr. Pearl suggests are deserving of such brutality. Mr. Pearl has no degree in child development. He is not ordained in any ministry.I see this method as a way of ensuring your child fears and resents you from the earliest possible age. Why would anyone want to do this to their child?"
2,Abuse couched in Limbaugh style sarcasm...,"I do not know any Christian family who would promote any of the sentiments I read from the ""Look Inside""The first page of the first chapter is a mash up of unloving sarcasm:1. Seeking to trade their children for someone else's2. Comparing a child's behavior to something that would break a machine3. Suggesting that ""whacks"" over a diapered butt do nothing but put the child's spine out of alignmentWhat does this introduction accomplish? First impression: reckless and irresponsible--the kind of person who should not be allowed to breed OR train anything, whether children OR pets OR farm animals! Stick to the Horse Whisperer...both YOU and YOUR CHILD will be healthier!"
5,Great book but not for stupid people,"I read this book and implemented the basic strategies of the Pearls. Pretty simple and straightforward for people with brains. We have 5 kids and we were doing pretty well with them but the basics of the book have transformed a good household into a much better one. The kids get along better, it is more peaceful, joyous household. You have to be consistent. None of the things in this book are revolutionary, they are basic principles. But we were not being consistent. Our kids are happier now and express much more joy and love toward us. Now if you are an idiot and only take this book as a bible for beating your kids, you are intellectually dishonest and/or a real moron. Or you really didn't read the whole book. Probably the case I think. Anyway, I enjoyed it, it makes sense and we actually don't have to discipline, yell or tell the kids a million times not to do something. It is peaceful again."
1,Linked to child abuse,"This book has been directly linked to the death of children. Please read this article:""Preaching Virtue of Spanking, Even as Deaths Fuel Debate"", online at the New York Times (Published: November 6, 2011).Don't buy this book. It's dangerous. There is a petition at Change.org with more information.There are many good books out there. This is not one of them."
1,1 star doesn't begin to describe...,"I've heard of child training being compared to animal training, but never quite like this. When responsible, intelligent, knowledgeable people speak of animal training they speak of using consistency, patience, and an understanding of limitations. There is no talk of whipping into submission. I haven't even noticed whippings mentioned in this book...when it speaks of animals. Why then, do they consider themselves applying animal-trainer logic when they speak of whipping children?The Pearls recommend whipping infants only a few months old. They recommend whipping the bare skin of ""every child"". Parents who don't whip their babies into complete submission are portrayed as neglectful (p.19).How does a four month old understand what they are being whipped for? Where is the logic in this behavior? Is it clear that I condemn this book?"
1,This is absolutely revolting.,I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist employed as a social worker in the domestic violence and child abuse unit of a police department. This book made me sick to my stomach. It is a manuel describing how to abuse children. Any parent that actually tortured their infants and children in the manner the author prescribes would be arrested for child abuse in the state of California. Clearly the author is sadistic. Please do not purchase this book. I urge amazon not to sell this book. It is pure rubbish and is absolutely disgusting.
1,Worst parenting book I didn't finish.,"I received this book as a well meaning gift, but after reading only the first two chapters I stopped, and threw the book away. This book, under the guise of religion and the bible, advocates child abuse as a legitimate means of discipline. A short time after tossing this book, I watched its advice in action at a relative's house. My fears were confirmed - the child's behavior was entirely based on fear of physical pain (abuse). Since then, I have discovered Love and Logic, which has been a wonderful way of encouraging my children to be creative, energetic, thoughtful and kind."
4,A Good Book on Raising Children,This book has many good examples of how to help your children learn how to obey and how you as a parent can discipline appropriately so both you and your child will be happier. No parent enjoys being around children who are constantly misbehaving and children don't enjoy being constantly corrected. This book helps parents learn to be consistent in discipline and in their motivation and method so the child will know what to expect when they behave and when they misbehave and will make better choices. But raising children is not just about how to get them to obey. It is first about loving them and caring more about their good than about our own comfort and convenience.
1,Hideously horrible!!!!!!!,"This book should be retitled, "" Train Up a Child Abuser"".This is essentialy a book to teach unknowing parents how to beat their children-including babies!!!!!!!!!!HOrrific!I liken this piece of trash to the Holocaust!As a Christian, I believe in love and forgiveness.As a parent whose never struck her children, and SOMEhow, haschildren who are accomplished and well mannered, compassionate and courageous in their own right, I KNOW beating children is NOT the way Christ would have it be."
1,Creepy,This book gives me the creeps! When I'm old enough to babysit I won't whip babies like the Pearls say to do. I'll be nice to them!
1,CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED,"WARNING:When used as directed, may cause long term psychological damage, low self esteem, bruising and even death.Before you turn to this book, Google search Sean Paddock, Lydia Schatz, Hana Grace-Rose Williams...Consider the consequences and look elsewhere for sage parenting advice.Try this bookGrace-Based Parentinginstead."
1,Murder manual,"Seriously, Amazon, how many more children have to die before you pull this from your shelves? If this were a book about how to commit rape or terrorist acts, would you carry it as well under the guise of first amendment freedom? Lydia Schatz, Sean Paddock and Hana Williams were all subjected to the abuse expoused in this book, and now are dead and their parents in prison. This book promotes the ceaseless torture of children from infancy until they take their last breath, which in these cases was a tragically short time."
1,This book killed a child in WA state,"This garbage was used as the basis for the systematic torture and eventual murder of a child in WA state, a child adopted from Ethiopia, who had already gone through Hell, then had the misfortune of being adopted by two nitwits who bought this book. It should be burned, so those with no sense can't use it to abuse their children. Disgusting.Just noticed there are ""collectible"" editions at $17.00! No doubt with the blood of innocent children on them! - Pearl fans are salivating at the thought."
1,Reprehensible,"To think that anyone would treat a child like this is sickening. If I could, I would give it no stars. Like another reviewer said, parents can be arrested for treating their children like this. Enough said."
1,I'll just post this here...,"[...]the reviewers who go into the details of the methods advocated tell the story well. this is beyond anything sane, rational, kind, or loving. this is abuse and while i can related to free speech, blah blah blah, this sort of material concerns the most vulnerable (hitting an infant?!?). there are enough loony tune fringe websites out there where this sort of garbage can be found... amazon, do you really need to carry this? we're not talking S&M; and consenting adults. we're talking about the planned beatings of children. come on."
5,Wonderful advice!,This is a great book with practical information on how to train your child to be cheerful and obedient! (What a great combination!!) I have implemented many of the suggestions given in this book with great results! This is a must read!
1,New Title: Child Abuse for Dummies,This book is AWFUL!!What parent in their right mind would spank an infant with a switch? Pulling a nursing babies hair?This book is so bad that it makes me physically ill.Buy it and propogate a new generation of abusers.
2,Summary,"Simply put this book talks too much about ""the rod"" and quoting the bible. If you are ok with that then it has some very good points. I could only get about 1/3 way through before it became too much."
4,To Train up a Child,"This book was very interesting. There were three points that I took away from reading it that would be good for any parent. 1. Love your child, spent time together doing things that the child is interested in. 2. Consistency. Be consistent with your discipline. 3. Start early. If you wait till they are 5 to teach them to be respectful, it is going to be difficult."
1,"Abusive, Damaging, & Reprehensible","This self-published book amounts to a child abuse manual for those wishing to learn how to psychologically and physically harm children.Neither of the Pearls have any training in child behavior, psychology or education. Neither of the Pearls have any theological training. They are lay people with NO 'expertise' other than in getting published and marketing their brand of psychological torture.This book has been found in the homes of several murdered children....tortured, maimed, and murdered employing exactly the same 'advice' given in this book.A good history on this book can be found at:[...]and this article details more about the murdered children from followers of this couple.[...]"
1,sick people,"The Pearls will eternally ""burn in hell"" for spreading such vile information through the words of their God. Clueless...I truly hope that most people have more sense than to believe this crap!"
1,This book needs to be removed!!!,This book is abhorrent! It advocates abuse and it needs to be removed from Amazon and everywhere else for that matter. The Pearls are disgusting people for advocating abuse in the name of Christ. Absolutely horrible!!!!
1,Horrible!,"Well, amazon should be ashamed to have this book on sale. It's about ""how to abuse a child"". The authors should be in jail for what they have done to their kids."
1,This book promotes child abuse,What they don't tell you is that several children have died from these so-called child-training methods. Children are not animals. It is even illegal to treat animals the way that this book suggest to discipline children. I am ashamed that amazon caries this book and I am going to cancel my prime account because of it.
1,God wants us to beat our children??????,"Here's a couple of quotes, you dcide:My wife did not waste time finding a cure. When the baby bit, she pulled hair (an alternative has to be sought for baldheaded babies). Understand, the baby is not being punished, just conditioned. After two or three times of biting, with the accompanying head hurting, the child programs that information away for his own comfort. The biting habit is cured before it starts. This is not discipline. It is obedience training.""""These truths are not new, deep insights from the professional world of research, but rather, the same principles the Amish use to train their stubborn mules, the same technique God uses to train His children. These principles are profoundly simple and extremely obvious. After examining them with us, you will say, 'I knew that all along. Where have I been? It's so obvious.'""[...]"
1,Disgrace,This book is very sad. We are here to help our children becomes meaningful worthwhile people and fear and abuse are not the path to that. When we respect them we teach them to respect. When we love them we treat them to love. When we abuse them and make them afraid they may comply but we are teaching them nothing but fear and obedience. This does nothing to help them make their way in the world and actually know right from wrong. Anyone who believes that starting to hurt a child as young as 8 months is severely damaged. We as their parents are their only link to survival and to have the people that should be showing them love start hurting them must create utter confusion in a non- verbal being. I hope that anyone who reads this book see that this is not a path that should be taken. That abuse is not the answer to having our children become successful human beings.
1,A guide for Child Abuse,"This book is merely a guide to promote child abuse. Although there are ways of disciplining a child. -any method ""violent"" certainly isn't the way. Because of this book, it has already claimed one child's life. One life taken, is one life too many.You can search youtube for a video about this story and this book. Please go to this link: [...]if that doesn't work, Search youtube for: ""Christian Parents Beat Their Daugther to Death for God""It saddens me to see such rubbish like this on Amazon. But it saddens me even more to see that this book is even in print.If you are greatly disturbed by this book, you can also report it to Amazon like I already have. Google search ""amazon contact"" and you'll find their contact team.Thanks for reading."
1,abuse with a belt!,Boycott this book as it is a handbook for child abuse and it's practices will cause long term psychological and physical damage to an innocent child.
1,Oh My Gosh!,I am absolutely horrified that this was even published! What is wrong with people? I hope honestly that NOONE else buys this book. The author deserves to have these things done to him!
1,"3 deaths from ""Training up You Child""",Here is a Seattle Times story describing one of the three childhood deaths that has followed in the wake of this book: [...]
1,Promotes Child Abuse,This book promotes both physical and emotional child abuse. The Pearls are crazy. Stay far away from this book and anything from No Greater Joy.
1,Please do not support a book that prpmotes child abuse.,"This book has been cited in numerous child abuse cases across the country and now in the murder of an adopted little girl from Ethiopia. Rather than buy this manual on how to beat your children into submission, I strongly suggest checking out any one of the many offerings from the Love and Logic Institute, which teach children to be responsible through consequences (not physical) with love and empathy."
2,"BF Skinner, anyone?","A friend lent this book to me and I was really, really shaken by it. While I do not accept my friend's opinion of this book (he is a very strong anti-Christian) as typical of Christian teaching, I felt the same helpless revulsion for the Pearl's tactics that I felt toward BF Skinner when reading him in college.I would call this more of a brainwashing technique than a child rearing book. Some of his ideas are sound, and I don't share the horror many reviewers have for corporal punishment as such. On the whole, however, I think that respect for the child as other is missing from Pearl's worldview."
1,The most horrible parenting book ever,"I sincerely hope people/parents do not read this book and actually believe it is the best way to raise a child. Love should be the underlying principle, not beating and whipping children. Spanking a child is not discipline, it is abuse. Especially in the manner in which it is described in this book. I am horrified this book was ever written, is still for sale and people actually would use in in their lives. I also am shocked to find these people are Christians. This book is very ant-Christian to me. I highly recommend NOT BUYING this book and searching for Dr. Sears, some natural or attachment parenting books. Something, anything, less callous and unrealistic than this terrible book would be much more beneficial for both the child and the parent (and in the long run family and society). I advise you to really research the parenting books out there (gentle discipline perhaps?) before buying this one--it will be a waste of your money."
1,harmful to child development,The authors of this book fail to mention that not one professional organization concerned with the welfare of children endorses it. The authors have absolutely no credentials for giving advice to parents. It is a sad commentary that some of today's parents believe in what the authors are promoting. God help the children and communities where parents follow the advice of these authors.
1,Michael and Debi Pearl need help,Constantly hitting a child and being abusive makesthat child very nervous because he will be hit forevery wrong doing. What's wrong with love and talkingto the child. I am sooo sick inside of this behaviorand wrong council for training a child. Poor dears.Babies especially are innocent. God will judge.May parents see the truth and not follow this cruelty.
1,Depressing and Shameful,"There is enough said in these reviews to support why this book and the sale of this book is depressing and shameful. My heart goes out to all the children who are seeking love, respectful guidance and their own place in this world, and instead they are met with violence from their parents. This book stirs up a rage in me I never knew I had, especially after having now become a mother myself."
1,Dangerous advice.,"In this book there are passages talking matter-of-factly of pulling a nursing infant's hair to stop him or her from biting, hitting a four month old baby with a twelve inch willow switch, and choosing your ""instrument"", to include belts and ""larger tree branches"" for older children.Lord have mercy."
1,sinful. disgusting. criminal.,"If I could rate this book as a zero... I would in an instant.I've read this book, not only is it in direct opposition to what scripture tells us about discipline, it is criminal in how they instruct a person to beat, whip, hit & harm newborns, infants and children.To instruct a parent to strap a young girl into a carseat for three to four hours (while ignoring screams and cries for help) AFTER repeated whippings with a tree branch because she cried as she was being placed in the seat... is simply disgusting.To use the Bible as a vehicle for this lunacy is beyond hideous. It is sinful to invoke the name of God through such autrocities.Breaking a child's spirit, a child's will to live, completely disregarding a child's feeling and opinions, hitting them, whipping them without pants, even with pants is to create a new generation of abusers.I cannot believe Amazon continues to offer this book."
1,WTF??????,"Fabulous manual for anyone who wants a step by step guide on how to abuse and F**K up your child for the rest of its life. Any sane parent out there who doesn't want to resort to physical violence take my advice. Follow your instincts, keep your hands to yourself (unless your using them to hug your baby) and you won't go far wrong. This people are obviously insane - they should be locked up. Sadly God won't get to tell these people how misguided they are, as they will surely go to hell when their time beating up all of earths children is over."
5,Excellent parenting resource,"Excellent parenting resource, very practical and appropriate to distribute or create a parenting class based on this material..I was given this book when my children were very small and used it as a resource over all of the years..."
5,Great kids!,This book is helping to direct my parenting and keep my husband and I on the same page. We both love it. And have found that it is already working wonders with our two year old. Thank you Mike and Debi for your awesome book.
5,the best,I loved this book!I love the common sense teaching..and for all the haters:this book does not teach nobody to abuse their children..if you actually pay attention it's quite the opposite.
1,"Technically ""No Stars""","The author's of this book adhere to ""another Jesus"", not the loving Father of the New Testament. Christ himself said ""suffer the little children"" meaning be patient with them, and to ""forgive seventy times seven"". The authors of this book are guilty of child abuse, possible death in having written this dark tome and are no doubt bound for eternal lock either here or in the burning judgement of the here-after.Shame on you people, may the Lord turn your hearts of stone into hearts of flesh and steer you right before it's too late...---Army Medic"
1,This book shouldn't be sold on Amazon!,"Animals shouldn't even be treated with the recommendations made in this book. If you are looking for a book that has helpful suggestions to raise children in a loving and truly Chris-like manner, look elsewhere."
1,STOP SELLING IT!,"This book is a guide on how to correctly abuse your child. It doesn't matter what religion you are, because the law applies to everyone. If a DSS agent saw any parent practicing what is in this book, they would rip the child out of the parent's hands. As a regular Amazon cutomer, it is hard for me to see such a disgusting thing that promotes unlawful child abuse being sold on this website."
1,To BEAT Up A Child,"Child abuse is disgustingly amoral and hitting a child in any fashion IS abuse. The bible says lots of ridiculous things such as don't mix fibers, touch a menstruating woman or kill/sell your children into slavery. GET REAL! Stop using Jesus as an excuse for being a monster. Violence is violence is violence. Try time out or taking away a favorite toy for a set amount of time. Guess what? It works."
1,Ignorant wackjobs,"Now a child has died and the book referenced in court documents is this one.The description here on Amazon is poorly written, that's a clue right there. You cannot search inside the book. In the description, ""discipline"" is clearly misunderstood as ""punishment."" Discipline is not something you resort to when all else fails. Discipline is a life skill, a way of being, it is something to practice daily, a tool to use in attaining life goals. It is something you teach a child not something you do to a child.Poor Hanna Williams."
1,The Year 2011,"After watching a CNN report about a family that whipped their daughter to DEATH after following the advice in this book,I looked this up on Amazon and read the first chapter--free.We live in 2011 not 1511,too many so called religious people and others abuse their children in this way then wonder why we live in such a violent society.Violence breeds violence.This ""wonderful"" country we live in, legally beat children in public schools,beat their children at home,engage in war after war after war,imprisons more of their own citizens than any other country on the planet,and love their guns.This book is garbage do not buy.Imagine No Religion."
1,Wacked Out Sickos,"I can fully understand a parent's right to ""train up"" their children in the way they see fit within the confines of the law. However, to actually endorse the spanking of infants...and then to actually manufacture an instrument whose sole design is to bring physical pain to a child...is pretty warped. There is positive proof that spanking a child is unnecessary to achieve a healthy, well-adusted, well-behaved child. Spanking is for lazy fools who think that loving a child is beating them into submission. Sadly, these two fools give Christianity a bad name...by harming babies in the name of Jesus. Irresponsible idiots."
1,Awesome book on beating your kids!,"I tried what they recommended in this book, but the kids keep dying on me.What am I doin' wrong?"
1,Don't Buy It!!!,"I was recommended a similar book to this one, but had a friend that actually read this one and we both regret ever reading the books. I was personally given another book written by this couple on women's roles, and it is awful. The authors sound convincing, but even Satan can quote scripture. Please don't buy it, don't buy the book or the ideas in it, they are greatly in error. Although I didn't read it, what I've heard of the ideas in this book could lead to child abuse."
1,misguided and disgusting,"This is the single most disgusting display of ignorance in print today. How can anyone read this and not consider the ""advice"" child abuse is beyond me. People like this give the Bible a bad name."
1,Truly Disgusting,"A baby should NEVER be hit - or as they call it ""trained"". This is not a parenting book, it is a book on terrorism. Also, all of those five star reviews, take a look and you'll notice a big group on Dec 22nd, a big group on Nov 9th, etc. My point being that they obviously had the day free to write fake reviews about their book on child abuse.[...]Please copy and paste the above into your browser. It is a petition to remove this book from Amazon.com. We are only about 300 short of the 10,000 signature goal."
1,Their souce is fantasy,"While I did not read the entire book, I did get through about 60% of it and found it was so utterly ridiculous from authors with no more education and training than the experience of ""raising"" their own children that I couldn't waste any more life energy on it. I can make this really short and sweet:In the classic declared reasoning behind putting your child through painful ""corrections"", the book claims, ""God would not have commanded parents to use the rod if it were not good for the child."" Great source! Hey, Mr. & Mrs. Hayseed: ""God didn't command ANYTHING!"" Some unknown un-peer reviewed ancient author wrote down on a piece of papyrus ""to spare the rod is to spoil the child."" Get your heads out of the bronze age!This book is beyond useless. If you insist on reading a Christian author as your guide to raising children might I suggest something from James Dobson to be more in the realm of reality than this trash."
1,One of the worst books,"I understand that there is freedom of the press so you can pretty much print whatever you wish but I mean come on really is it okay to print about beating up our children? If all we want to do is beat our children then what is the point of having them ? Children was suppose to be loved and showed how to act not beat into submission. If all we do is beat our children to get them to act the way we want, then what are they going to learn to do when they want something when they are older ? I mean really would you go to work and beat your boss because he wasn't acting the way you wanted?"
1,"Proverbs also says to put a knife to your throat.. prov 23:2 that is not literal, God does not command us to beat our kids for","Proverbs also says to put a knife to your throat.. prov 23:2 that is not literal, God does not command us to beat our kids for all discipline. Especially not to to pull a nursing infants hair and to whip a 4 month old and whipping babies who cannot sleep and are crying, and to never allow them ""to get up and whipping a 3 year old until he is ""totally broken."", and a mother should hit her child if he cries for her and tripping their non-swimming toddler so she falls into deep water, etc These things do not sound very loving to me. I am ok with holy spanking but not like this book says. As long as we are disciplining and training our kids, it don't matter how as long as it is holy."
5,a must read for every parent,"great information.. I have read other books by the pearls and this one was just as good. as a 1st time expectant mom I am looking forward to implementing the ideas and raising well behaved, loving children."
1,Please don't buy this book..... !!! Don't condemn yourself.,"This book is the most evil and cruel I have ever seen in my 67 years of life. These authors don't have the slightest idea how discipline children. If you ever get ahold of this evil book, please destroye it."
1,Recipe for disaster!,"Amazon, please stop selling this book. Many have found some useful hints by reading some of it. But reading further you find it advocates hitting a 7 month old, withholding food, using a ""tool"" to beat a child and so much more. Parenting strong willed children is frustrating at best, and some may read this and believe it will solve their problems. There are currently at least two dead children whose parents openly say they used tactics from this book. How many more have to die, or be scarred forever. This is not about to spank or not to spank, this is about to abuse or not to abuse. Many frustrated (and we all have been there) parents may not be clear enough thinking to realize how damaging this book can be. There are many knowledgeable authors out there who have written many excellent books that will help parents, this is not one of them. Dr. Ray Guarendi takes a no nonsense, loving approach, some might find his books helpful."
1,this book should be banned and removed from sale,"Based on the reviews I have read and what I know about attachment theory and the raising of children I would say that this book should be removed from sale as it poses a threat to children. I am horrified that some mis-guided individuals will buy this book believing that the way to raise children is to systematically torture and abuse them. Please, please don't buy it and please Amazon show some responsibility by removing it from sale."
5,A present help in time of need,"Before reading this book, my wife and I struggled with a very strong-willed, defiant son. We had read and attempted to follow advise given in other books, but nothing seemed to help. ""To Train Up A Child"" was recommended to us, and at that point we were willing to try anything. It was a God-send.This book made a difference and changed our lives. We now have 5 children and are complemented on a regular basis on how well behaved they are, people ask us how we did it. Our answer is, God sent us the help we needed before it was too late. We employed the principles set forth in ""To Train Up A Child"" and God has blessed us with a happy and peaceful home."
1,Advocates child abuse and should not be for sale on Amazon,"This book advocates beating children under one year old in the name of ""discipline."" This is disgusting and has no place in healthy parent/child relationships. I'm disappointed Amazon for even carrying it."
1,Tell AMazon to remove this book or you'll cancel your account,"This book is beyond deplorable. It is a how-to instruction manual on child abuse.I asked Amazon to remove it from their sales list and they replied"" As a retailer, our goal is to provide customers with the broadest selection possible so they can find, discover, and buy any item they might be seeking. That selection includes some items which many people may find objectionable. Therefore, the items offered on our website represent a wide spectrum of opinions on a variety of topics.""Don't get me wrong -I am not in support of book banning. However, retailers should have a conscience and not sell materials advocating child abuse as defined by law. If people want to purchase the book, they can do so through the Pearl's website.Boycotts work - ask Amazon to remove this title as an act of conscience.Thank you"
1,This book is disgusting!,"If there was an option for no stars, that's what I would have given it. This book advocates child abuse. The whole book can be read online at http://city.hokkai.or.jp/%7Erepent/EnglishPages/TrainUp.htmlExerpt:OBEDIENCE TRAINING--BITING BABIESOne particularly painful experience of nursing mothers is the biting baby. My wife did not waste time finding a cure. When the baby bit, she pulled hair (an alternative has to be sought for baldheaded babies). Understand, the baby is not being punished, just conditioned.Pulling a BABIES hair is NOT COOL!!DISGUSTING!!!"
1,sick!!,This is just plan sick!! Why would anybody want to read a book on how to abuse children? I think the people who approve of the book are just as sick as the writers of the book!!
1,This item rates 0 STARS!! It should be taken OFF AMAZON!!!,"I can't believe that in this day and age, with all the knowledge about how child abuse damages a child for life, there is actually a book that teaches parents how to be child abusers. The Pearls are sadly mistaken if they believe that their methods will create great adults that will be compassionate and loving, out of children raised this way. I will never, NEVER recommend this book, except to my daughters to learn how to use scissors on!! Someone needs to call child protective services to investigate these two!!"
1,Abuse at its core!,"You have got to be kidding me. Who would read this book and follow the ideas set forth in it? I am a Christian, but I worry about these people's souls. You do not beat infants into submission. There is a special place in h*ll for these people."
1,"Headline says it all: ""Controversial book part of adopted girl's murder investigation""","On 09/30/11 I read the article linked below. I feel an obligation to share this information in the hopes that it would help. Unfortunately, I can't believe that a book is the sole cause of the torture and death of a child. The parents are 100% responsible despite their choice of reading material.Amazon redacted the article link. You can find it by searching for ""Couple arrested, charged with abusing child to death""It's the article in ""goskagit"".One quote from the horrifying article: ""But they got at least part of their parenting advice from a controversial book entitled ""To Train Up A Child."" It was written by a Tennessee preacher who advocates the infliction of pain and withholding of food as forms of punishment. An adopted California girl was beaten to death by her parents who read the same book.""Please give your child nothing but love, acceptance and a sense of well-being. Anything less is unacceptable."
1,this book is an abomination,"here's a quote:""One particularly painful experience of nursing mothers is the biting baby. My wife did not waste time finding a cure. When the baby bit, she pulled hair (an alternative has to be sought for baldheaded babies). Understand, the baby is not being punished, just conditioned""So this book wants to advocate physicially punishing a nursing infant?This book is DISGUSTING and their authors' lives bear some investigation by authorities."
1,Another Child Dead,"Today I found out that another child, this one in Washington state, has died at the hands of parents using this book. This makes, what, five in just a few years?This book is a manual on how to beat and degrade your children, in some cases to death. Yes, I have actually read it, and it only underscored my opinion. These people believe that little babies should be beat with plumbing line. Is it any surprise that we hear so often about children who died because of the Pearls' methods?God did not give you children so you could abuse them. He gave them to you to love and raise with wisdom and mercy, not to beat like dogs. Unless you want to be the next parent facing a murder charge, find another manual. If you want to read the book just to see how low a human being can sink, read it for free at this link: [...]"
1,Set your children up to fail??!!,"This author suggests putting ""no no"" objects at a child's level, so you can ""switch"" them (i.e. HIT THEM) for trying to grab the object. This is not parenting. This is entrapment."
1,Ban this work,"This book is poorly written and contains horrible advice like ""If you have to sit on him to spank him then do not hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered."" To be fair, it also contains useful ideas about being consistent and proactive in disciplining children, but there are thousands of parenting books out there that contain these same reasonable points without advocating abuse.The petition to have this book removed from Amazon at change.org ([...]) has over 8,000 signatures today. After hearing experiences like Elizabeth Esther's experiences ([...]) and listening to the author (Michael Pearl's) defense, I don't understand how any ethical company can sell this product."
1,PLEASE REMOVE THIS BOOK,"It is clear there are people out there not fit to have children when they read books like this and beat their children to death because there were adived to starve and beat them. PLEASE AMAZON in the name of a true loving and caring GOD, remove this book from the eyes of these screwed up minds."
1,"""HOW TO BEAT YOUR CHILD""","And also make them cry and only respect you and say they love you out of fear. Thats what this book should be called. Just look at the authors, they look like they are from the 17th century and this book should be from the 17th century!! Just look at the table of contents....Anyone with half a brain or knows basic psychology should know you dont have to whip and beat your children for them to behave! This book is pure trash and anyone who reads it is a lowlife. AMAZON, get this book off of your site, i cant believe you are selling this. These Religious Zealots should go to prison."
1,This book is awful!,This book is written by crazy fundamentalists.Children don't need to be beaten into submission. The evidence against them suggests that they don't know what they are talking about. Their occultish behavior is not one you'd want to emulate.
1,Horrible!,"This is a horrible book that encourages child abuse! Avoid at all costs! Parents should discipline their children, but this book is extreme. Why not work on building a solid family relationship, instead of treating your child like an animal as this book encourages."
1,A child abuse manual,"A child was found dead port Washington. The parents claim to be raising the child according to the principles of this book. So I decided to read it.This book is a manual on child abuse. Following it's principles will result in a child who is so damaged, it is almost criminal. Further research proved that this book has been linked to multiple cases of child abuse across the country.This claiming it is Biblical teaching , and "" in the way of Jesus"" have no real understanding of scripture or Christianity. Picking out a few passages that when translated from the original Greek, Hebrew or Aramaic may appear to endorse physical punishment of children, is not the way to approach child rearing, if you are considering using the principles in this book, please look into other methods of child rearing."
1,Misleading and Harmful to Children,"This book advocates childrearing practices that are not only rejected by the majority of professionals, but that are associated with children's becoming more aggressive. I cannot recommend it. Carolyn Newberger"
1,"Total Crap, permission to abuse your child.","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. An old friend who I have not seen in years gave me this book with a handwritten note that when you find a good parenting book, you want to share it with others. Problem: She started home schooling 4 years ago and I think she has gone CRAZY. Her kids are obedient, that's for sure. And lifeless. No emotion, no joy, no personality. Apparently she has followed this book to the letter, because her kids are robots. Anyone that can read this book and not be outraged and disgusted should not be parenting. The guy that wrote it is a complete control freak and a bully. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
1,Unbelieveable,A husband and wife will be spending a combined 32 years in prison for killing their child using this book as their guide.They beat her to death. A child. No worse violation of what God teaches us.Please do not buy this book. In fact Amazon should remove it from their inventory.
1,Please Do NOT buy this book!!!,"I think its a disgusting book that should be banned! This does not tell you how to ""spank"" your child or give him a smack on the butt....It teaches you how to beat and humiliate your child. It teaches and ""preaches"" that abuse; physical or sexual is okay as long as the abuser seeks redemption. You have got to be kidding!!!There are many other effective ways to communicate and teach your children rules, discipline and respect!!! Please, please do not buy this book. There is enough abuse against children in this world. People certainly don't need a manual teaching them to do so! Shame on you Michael & Debi Pearl and Shame on you Amazon for selling this book!!"
2,Too much chaff among the wheat,"I would describe the author as right-hearted but wrong-headed. There is way too much ""chaff"" to sift through among the wheat. He actually has some very good thoughts on training and discipline but his thoughts on the application of corporal punishment are way too heavy-handed and not necessary.I would avoid this book. If you do read it, be discerning. I recommend books by James Dobson such as ""Dare To Discipline""."
1,Child Abuse,"This is absolutely disgusting. This is basically a book explaining exactly how to abuse your children. I was raised in a Christian home and none of these principles were ever applied. ""At four months she was too unknowing to be punished for disobedience. But for her own good, we attempted to train her not to climb the stairs by coordinating the voice command of ""No"" with little spats on the bare legs. The switch was a twelve-inch long, one-eighth-inch diameter sprig from a willow tree."" These people smacked their four-month-old on the legs. You've got to be kidding me. I have a four-month-old and the last thing in the world I would do is lay a hand on her. Ugh. How this book is even available on Amazon is a mystery to me. This is disgusting. I wish I could have given a rating of zero stars."
1,terrible!,This book advocates outright child abuse!I do NOT recommend it and hope that it will soon be off the shelves!
5,Intelligent Recommendations,"What I love about their teachings is that their most important point is that you make thoughtful informed decisions in all aspects of being a good Christian. I am surprised that some other reviews miss this and dub this book a ""child abuse proponent"". I encourage you to visit their website and see for yourself their obvious love of children and their intent to guide children into being contributing members of society. They are offering a different point of view in this liberal immoral society, but they never say to stop thinking for yourself. Their point is not the corporal punishment, but to train the child. If you actually read their full philosophy and implement discipline in your household you would find the need for corporal punishment almost non-existent."
1,A manual for child abuse,"I am horrified that pulling a baby' s hair is considered ""good discipline"". Amazon needs to get this book off it's shelves."
5,Great book!!,"This book is a fabulous read! You should also check out their website!! If you have children-your home library is NOT COMPLETE WITHOUT THIS BOOK! It takes biblical wisdom, and gives you practical uses. Now, I also know that there are news stories of children who lost their lives because their parents beat and abused them to death. People are also blaming this book for those tragedies. Please dont take this book out of context-read it for yourself! Discipline and abuse are two very different things-the parents in those deaths went WAY OVER THE LINE!My advice to you: 1)pray for Gods direction and an open heart as you read this book, and may He show you truth."
3,Old fasions,This book is written with be best intent in mind. The authors are very conservative and do use the Bible to back up every point they are trying to make. Although they do use the King James Version of the Bible it is sometimes difficult to understand what point they are trying to make with it. So i would look it up in an NIV Bible and read a few verses before and after to understand more of that they were talking about. I did get very good tools I started to use and have seen great improvement in my 20 month old son. The book basically wants you to be consistent so the child knows what is okay and not. if a parent is inconsistent then the child does not know and is getting punished sometimes and not others.
4,quite helpful,"This book actually led me away from spanking and raising my voice to the calmer method of training and dealing with problems before they arise. I was a bit confused when I began to read the book, as the difference between training and discipline was not immediately clear, but eventually I got it. Some of the reviews were so funny - my husband was wondering what was making me laugh so hard.....clearly, not all reviewers read the book.Please, Please read ""no greater joy"" to clarify this book. It gives real-life examples of what the Pearls are talking about. I learned more from that book than this one. I would also like to emphasize that the Pearls do not suggest going on a spanking escapade. They want parents to TRAIN their kids so they don't have to be disciplined as often. No Greater Joy gave lots of common-sense training examples that I will definitely be able to apply."
1,The book promotes sadistic torture,"There is a difference between corrective spanking and torture. Would that the authors of this book could experience it. This book has been used as a guide by numerous parents that have murdered their children by following it's advice. I realize that guns don't kill people, people kill people. But in this case, Debi and Michael Pearl are putting the gun in some people's hands."
5,The best child-traing book,"This is THEE best child-training book on the market. Just because someone is given one of these books to HELP them in their training, doesn't mean they will use it properly. Having a good attitude with EVERYthing we do in life allows us to receive the benefits of God's grace and blessings as we watch our DISCIPLINED children grow up to be mighty in Spirit."
1,It needs to be on the banned books list...,This book gives Christianity a bad name. There are so many other balanced and non-abusive parenting books out there. Please pass this one by! Too bad I had to give it even one star.
1,wow,any one who reads and or follows this book is down right p a t h e t i c. ... I hope you rot in h e l l. this is child abuse. I have not and will not read this book just based on the reviews I have see. with direct quotes from the book. just the few passages I have read makes me wan to find the pearls and beat them senseless untill they 'surrender'. the pearls are sick sick controlling people.
1,Disgraceful and abusive.,"If you think that the methods described in this book are necessary then you are failing as a parent and probably as a human being. I notice a lot of Christians are backing this book...I guess your perception of what is acceptable is warped when you are raised within a morally bankrupt institution that excuses child abuse (physical,sexual and psychological) by it's figure heads whist simultaneously condemning anyone who doesn't fit into it's scripture's template of normal.Talk to your children people, you'll be amazed what happens when you listen.If you do need help and want to raise a child that won't despise and resent you in later life then I would recommend goggling ""Love and Logic""."
1,Disgusting,"This book is vile & disgusting, and I am appalled that it is being allowed to be sold on Amazon.com. Child abuse is a growing problem, and this book does nothing but encourage it."
1,Relying on this book can kill a child,"An adopted 13 year old girl is now dead of hypothermia after being left outside without adequate clothing by her ""How to Train up a Child"" following ""parents"" Hana Grace-Rose Williams was beaten, tortured, humiliated and starved before she finally died. If you know people who are using this book as a guide to child rearing, watch for signs of abuse and report to authorities, you may save a child's life."
1,Not good advice for parents,"With substantiated child abuse and neglect cases in the U.S. approaching a million children, it is irresponsible to tell parents to whip children, even infants, with objects including belts. Billions of dollars are spent on child abuse prevention and treatment in the U.S. This book can only encourage and excuse child abuse."
1,Very very Ill,"This book is so sick in so many ways, but as you read you notice that no aspect of the child's personality is noted other than his ""stubborness"" and his ""naughtiness"" or whatever negative aspect of the child's personality they can dream up.They literally use the phrase, ""to break them"" - their goal is to break the kids. Have you ever seen a broken child? Do you know what kind of life a child broken young lives?These people are very sick and should not be able to get any closer than 10 feet to any child, including their own.P.S. Children are not mules."
1,Subtitle could be how to Abuse Your Children,This is a horrible book. Posion for the mind. Stay away!!!
1,"If there were a ""zero"" star option, that would still be too much","With reservation, the most disgusting book I have ever read. As a Christian Mother, I can not fathom that Jesus EVER intended us to be so cruel to our children."
1,Disgraceful,"Are you people who say this book is a helpful aid to parenting mad? This book is a disgrace. Using violence on children in the name of discipline, teaches children that violence is a positive part of life. The authors of this book should be locked up for purporting to be childcare experts. All they are expert in is in being completely deluded and devoid of love and compassion. And if you really believe the kind of rubbish in this book, you are no better than you deserve to be. Children should be cherished, nurtured and taught with love and compassion, not beaten. The authors of this book even recommend violence against babies. How any of you who recommend this could possibly think that hurting a child is a positive step is beyond me."
1,Pearls of Evil,"The Pearls' book is a guidebook to evil. If you have no love for your children and no faith in a higher power, you may be able to follow the Pearl Way. However, if you have conscience and common sense, you will throw this rubbish in the trash where it cannot hurt another child. Parents who look to their faith for wisdom will look away from books like this."
1,Amazon has lost my business due to selling this book,"I am appalled that Amazon is selling this book.This book is an instruction manual in torture and abuse, and in my opinion should not be protected by censorship laws anymore than a book instructing how to rape or kill someone. The practices it teaches are illegal as well as immoral. A seven year old girl was found dead after being starved, beaten and left outside by parents who followed the preachings of this book!!!!This book preys on the insecurity of parents by flatly telling them their children will burn in hell if they do not obey.It's unfortunate that there are parents trying to do well that get sucked in by these types of ""how-to"" books. Parents: think of what you are teaching your children by following the Pearl's advice? How do you expect your child to not raise his hand in anger, if thats what your doing?"
1,That is so wrong,Why the heck would Amazon sell a book that tells you how to abuse a child. Starting at the age of 6 months old for that matter. This person who wrote this book should go to jail and stay there for even thinking about touching a child that young.
1,Are you crazy?,I can't believe a great company like Amazon.com would sell a book like this. Its all about child abuse..I mean who spanks a 4 month old baby? And who spanks a 12 month old for crying for her mother? This is one reason our children are becoming murders at such young ages. You really should rethink selling this book on your website!
1,A boycott has been started,"Like others, I'd give negative stars if I could. A boycott has been started. These people are currently under investigation in Tennessee for(surprise!) child abuse. Please go here (this is not my site)[...] to read on the boycott and what you can do. Amazon--if you even read part of these reviews--please, please, remove this book for sale.I hate censorship, I would never tell someone to not carry a book because it has opinions differing to mine, but this is insane. These people not only promote child abuse, but promote it ""in the name of Jesus"". What they teach is NOT biblically commanded!!Please help.Toni"
5,Already had a copy,This book was my manual in the first year. I already had a great love for my daughter so all I needed was how to train her. She is 6 today and she is content and happy. I bought this copy for a friend. I told her that if she did not like it to please return it. It has valuable information for the rest of my disciplinary years.
1,Abusive methods & harsh viewpoint - very disappointed w/ this book,"This book is overall horrible. It is odd, at first this book talks about how important relationships are, and bonding with your child - and then it goes and tells you that if you do not WHIP your baby, you are a bad parent. The author believes that babies and children should be whipped, starting the first day they do something the parent doesn't like - such as crying or fighting a diaper change. His view of children is that they are all little brats out to manipulate you as much as possible. The author even advises the reader to whip a 7 month old, trip your child intentionally, pull your child's hair, ignore your child if he is injured. I hoped it would give me a good foundation for parenting, and instead it disgusted me."
1,OMG! This is disgusting!`,I am totally disgusted at Amazon for having the audacity to sell this book! It is horrific and any parent who tries any method in it should be arrested and beaten themselves! This is one my senator will find out about and put a stop to any more sales!
1,This is evil.,The author should be put in jail for advocating this evil to the public. I am outraged that anyone would find this HELPFUL. Is this how we want children to be treated in this country now? Unbelievable.
5,To train up a child,I love to read this book again and again!(and now I can listen it in MP3 :)) Great encouragement and hope for all parents. Also Mike and Debbie Pearl's other books and websites are very helpful for family and marriage relationships.They helped to keep my feet grounded and my chin up in many life situations. Lots of practical down to earth advices! I love my family and my kids sooooo much . They are happy obedient and sweet kids...I'm very thankful to my Lord for Mr and Mrs Pearl..:)
1,Heartsick,"I'm afraid that's how any compassionate Christian will feel after reading this book. Amazon asks reviewers to focus on content. Okay, the highlights of this book are the sections on mule discipline, cat kicking, baby torture, and the benefits of providing your child with a simulated near-drowning experience. If you have an interest in any of these topics, and are completly lacking a conscience, then this is certainly the book for you. Enjoy!"
1,I can't belive this is real,"PLEASE don't do this. A baby needs love not violence. God does not want you to hurt your children, it NEVER says that in the Bible. Please remember that God loves you and shows you kindness and He expects the same for the children he had entrusted to you."
1,a step by step manual for child abuse,"I've read this. I worked at a bookstore and read though it and what I saw horrified me.Go ahead, buy this book, follow its advice by all means if you want to beat your six month old with plumbing line. I'm not kidding.This isn't ""spanking"" this is abuse. Terrible terrible book.My son has never been hit, or abused and he's a terrific toddler. You do not have to abuse your kids to raise great kids.Btw, some of my Christan (I'm Jewish) friends have read this, and they were utterly horrified as well."
1,Absolute Horror,"I am speechless at the pure evil that is this book. This book supports the severe whipping and beating of small children. It even recommends pulling the hair of nursing infants! I cannot imagine any religious groups would find this acceptable. It scares me that some young, impressionable parent might read this and think this is a responsible way to parent. If one follows the guidelines set forth in this book, one can only expect to raise a violent, abusive monster. I cannot stress enough the ridiculously abusive, hateful nature of this book. Children are a gift to be loved, nurtured and guided; not beaten into obedience. Please do not buy this book."
1,A mother opinion,Good discipline should not involve physical punishment. This book is not a good parenting resource. It advocates physical punishment and that is never a good answer. Do not waste you money in this book. Poor written.
1,Don't buy this book,"This book promotes corporal punishment supposedly justified by scripture. A four year old boy died as a result of his mother using the Pearls ""system"". Unfortunately there isn't a way to give this book negative stars! But if there were it would get a negative 10!"
1,Child abuse!!!!,the book was responsible for the murders of at least three children!!! take it off the market and jail the author for spreading this idea that beating children is a great idea!!!
1,I would never whip my baby!,"I have a 12 month old baby and I am horrified that anyone could even think about hitting a child (much less whipping them with a rod) so small. My daughter only weighs 20 pounds and does not know how to talk - what could she possible gain from a full grown, 130 pound woman hitting her? Please, do not believe what this book says. Discipline your children, love them, but do not hit them."
1,Must read!!,"To Train Up a Child is a must read book for every parent who wants to know how to raise emotionally withdrawn, self deprecating, insecure, psychologically imbalanced kids. Trust me, I was one of them. I am a survivor"
5,thankful for this great book!,A friend recommended this book and it has changed our family! A great Biblical view and raising kids and a great encouragement from the Pearls. Thank You!!
1,Don't Buy this Book,"This instructions in this book are child abuse! Why would anyone do this? How could a person willingly make their children terrified of them so that they will behave? I never hit or spanked my son ever. His father and I used time outs and were consistent. He learned to read at three and in grade school was in the ""Gifted and Talented"" program. He is a now 16 and is a good kid. He does not drink or smoke. He does his homework and consistently gets good grades. He has a great group of responsible and kind friends. YOU DO NOT NEED TO HIT A CHILD TO GET THEM TO BEHAVE! Any child who goes through this is going to have deep resentment towards their parents. You will never have a real connection with your child."
1,The Authors are Monsters,"The authors actually have the audacity to equate the ""training"" of a child with the training of a dog.These people are monsters.I'd like to take a switch to THEIR behinds!"
1,"Violent, delusional, fundamentalist trash","These writers are delusional, violent zealots who attempt to veil and justify assault and torture through select, fragmented misinterpretation of a popular mythical/religious reference (Bible).Their focus on attacking and beating specifically the most helpless and powerless individuals is sociopathic at best.This should be considered rantings collected and published by the insane.This trash should not be listed at Amazon and brings into question their integrity."
1,"Amazon, quit selling this book","Amazon you need to quit selling this book, it is clearly a book teaching parents to abuse their children. It frightens me to think there are people out there who would use this book as a guide on how to parent."
1,is there a negative star?,These people advocate whipping your infant until they NO LONGER CRY to BREAK their spirit. They akin child rearing to mule training..They are awful people who write awful books. DO NOT BUY THIS!AWFUL.I can't believe amazon still sells this terrible book. It is BANNED IN OTHER COUNTRIES it is soo repugnant!
1,pure stupidity,"J. Connell's review said ""....this book comes from the biblical perspective that children are born in need of parenting and discipline in order to be productive members of society.""News Flash! ""Discipline"" means ""to teach."" There are far better, more positive ways to teach people than hitting them. Did Jesus beat his ""disciples"" in order to get their loyalty? I think not.Crazy fundamentalism is responsible for such people as Andrea Yates, Deanna Laney and Dena Schlosser. Your freedom of religion should stop where other people's bodies begin."
1,"Cruel control, not parenting advice at all","Horrid Horrid Horrid. How can anyone advocate beating babies from birth? Surely this is nothing more than child abuse? I am shocked that Amazon is even stocking this, let alone people have bought it. Vile and disgusting.There are plenty of non violent forms of nuturing , bring up and discipling children. I suggest readers look for them instead."
1,Nightmarish,"The instructions given in this book, if followed, consitute legal child abuse, and include phsyically striking crying infants (under 6mos of age). It is a shame that the authors, who admit to beating their own children, are not in jail."
5,"Best book EVER for how to raise a happy, confident child!",We have raised our 4 children by the principles set forth in this book. I cannot recommend the Pearls and their ministry enough! Changed my life.
1,SICKENING DISPLAY OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH,"This book has got to be the most disgusting and terrible thing ever written. I would even say that the Satanic Verses provide a better form of childrearing than this so-called book of discipline. I am a devout Christian and am extremely angry that a few ignorant people have taken words from the bible COMPLETELY out of context and twisted them into their own disturbed meaning to justify the abuse of their children. I hope that anyone out there who reads this realizes that this is in no way an example of Christianity. We promote love and forgiveness, not abuse and terrorizing helpless infants and children. Yes, discipline is reccommended in the bible but no where does it tell you to treat your children like this. There is not one example anywhere of Jesus Christ spanking or hitting a child."
1,Buy a better book,"There is no question that this book advocates abuse. It saddens me that there are people so conditioned to accept violence as normative that they don't view this book for what it is.If you are struggling to raise cheerful, well-disciplined children, please buy a copy of Positive Discipline, Parenting with Love and Logic, or 1-2-3 Magic (none of which have lead to the murder of children whose parents implemented their methods, unlike To Train Up A Child). Caring parents raise respectful and well-behaved children without resorting to corporeal punishment all the time. You can do it, too. Do not give into the temptation to beat your children rather than guide them. Buy a better book and be a better parent."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!,"This book is an excellent resource for raising children. The motivation behind all that the Pearl's teach is love. If you want happy, well adjusted children who will become happy, well adjusted adults - read this book. People get hung up on spanking. The problem with spanking is that few parents know how to administer it correctly. Most parents get so frustrated and mad with their children that they ""spank"" them while they are still angry. Of course this attitude gets the child confused! The Pearl's teach you how to discipline your child with love and concern. Keep up the good work Pearl's - we love you!!"
1,"Shame on Amazon,you help people to justify inflicting pain to childs","What Jesus said about those who would harm children comes inevitably to mind: ""It would be better for them if a millstone was hanged about their neck, and that they were drowned in the depth of the sea."""
1,completely do not understand..,"This type of parenting. I completely wasted my money and time reading this philosophy. There are much better resources out there for ""training up your child"".With the techniques that these people tout, I think he wouldn't have these techniques done to him as an adult. I was raised a conservative baptist and never did any of my churches praise these techniques.Don't waste your money!"
1,The way to death,How this book influenced parents to murder their child. A proper application of the bible should also lead to stonings![...]
1,A How-To Book on Abusing Children,Our babysitter used this book as a rationale to beat our infant son. The babysitter is now in jail on felony child abuse charges for following the guidelines set forth in this book. Violence and physical force are not God's way to raise our precious children.
1,Nasty Pearls Book,"The Pearls have no brains if they think it is ok to whip a baby who is crying for its mother, beat up a child over and over when they are having a tantrum, hit a curious baby, etc...Also, they say 'Don't let the child's crying allow you to lighten up on the intensity or duration of the spanking...', but what is that supposed to mean? If your child crys, tell them to shut up, and keep hitting them?I'm sorry, but these people need to think of using gentle discipline, enjoy their kids, etc... after all, their kids won't be kids forever now will they?At least Super Nanny Jo Frost has it right."
1,"How can anyone follow the ""advice"" in this book?","This book advocates hitting babies with a switch. I am amazed that anyone would spend money on this [stuff], much less follow the ""advice"" of a clearly [disturbed] man.If I EVER see anyone actually treating a child in this manner, I intend to call the police."
1,Wrong Wrong Wrong,"This book teaches corporal punishment as a means of disciplining children. It is urging parents to ""train"" their children by means of the highly illegal and immoral act of child abuse. Hitting babies????!!!! Amazon should discontinue sales of this book!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!,"Please for the sake of your innocent children, this is ABUSE! UN BE LIEVEABLE! Please, Amazon needs to get rid of this book I can't believe they have it on here, what a shame."
1,"horrible, sickening....",If you love your child please dont buy this book. I literally feel sick to my stomach. This isnt pArenting advice...this is child abuse. Period. DONT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
1,REMOVE THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON!!!!,NO STARS! ABSOLUTLY ATROCIOUS! CHILDREN ARE DYING DUE TO THE MISUSE OF INFORMATION ON LEARNING HOW TO BEAT THEIR CHILDREN 6 MONTHS OLD AND UP! THIS INCLUDES THAT MAKING CHILDREN FAST AS PUNISHMENT IS GOOD! GET RID OF THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!
1,amazon please pull this,"a little girl was spanked to death based on the ""teachings"" in this book. this is nothing more than a manual in torture and abuse. amazon please pull this book."
1,Opinion on to train up a child,It is a heartbreaking thought that Children are being touted as second class and compared to animals. DO NOT buy this book.
1,Really dislike this book,"I read an online copy of this book and was appalled. The Pearls advocate whipping very young infants. This is abuse! Despite their talk of love and taking joy in parenthood, their methods set up an adversarial, 'us against them' relationship between parent and child. The little good that is in this book can be found in other, much less controversial texts. If you must read this book, please do a yahoo search and find a free online text, so that you don't put money in these people's pockets."
1,to train a child: SICK,"This book is a child abuse guide and its sick yeah lets beat or neglect our children yeah sure they will be more displined! NOT! whoever even buys this book should actually think about the problems dont resort to beating or neglecting your children the authors of this book should be put in jail for child neglect and endangerment!!! How sick can you be! Our children are not supposed to be treated like that and if you feel that way maybe you should be a parent! I am going to forward this topic to a DHS/CPS center for review, & another thing I cannot even believe amazon would carry ""a how to guide"" like this! I will personally never be a customer of amazon again!Very sick to my stomach loving mother of two wonderful children!"
5,Helped our family,This book helped us discipline appropriately and without anger. We and our children are much happier now. Our famiy has greatly benefited from this book and I recommend it to everyone I know.
5,loving mommy and daddy loved this,"I read this and loved it! I took from it what I could use and left what I couldn't. It didn't make me want to beat my child to death, go figure! (or beat them at all) No book kills children! Nor can reading anything make you abuse your children. For those so disturbed and those unable to make rational, loving, godly child training choices, please seek pastoral support or a counseling, this will help more then child training books. There is never a reason to hurt a child, please seek help if you are having problems with anger/abuse within your family."
1,Evil!,"It's just evil. Need I say anymore? What's wrong with such people? I believe in rearing up children to be Godly adults, but this sure is not the way to do it."
1,This is a manual for child abusers,This book advocates whipping babies to train them. I'm amazed Amazon is prepared to sell it.
1,"Buyer, beware, beware, beware!!!","It has been revealed that someone had the nerve to actually READ and follow this book to discipline her child. Well, that child died as a result of the gobbledegook outlined in this book, and the mother faces a potentially lifelong prison sentence.C A V E A T E M P T O R to anyone who desires to read books on childrearing and discipline."
1,Are you kidding me?,This book promotes child abuse. Shame on the authors for writing it and giving people such horrible ideas. They make it sound like it is OK to hit babies and children and they actually describe it in the book. They should be arrested for child abuse! I am not sure why they have not been.I just don't understand why they are trying to promote such cruel behavior. Pick on someone your own size! This book has no place in our society.
1,"UNTIL THIS BOOK IS OFF AMAZON, I WILL NO LONGER SHOP HERE","Hitting a child, especially one at 6 months, is completely CHILD ABUSE. I cannot believe that Amazon.com would carry such a product. I am a very long-time customer, but I completely call for a boycott of this site until this is off the shelves. God NEVER advocated hitting or hurting ANYONE. EVER. PERIOD."
1,I hope the authors burn in hell,"No one but zealots see this as anything more than what it is, an instruction manual for child abuse. this isn't christianity, this is just ignorance. If you believe in hell, this kind of behavior will certainly send you there."
4,Good Sound Advice,"This was a very valuable book to my family. Both my brother and I read it and we noticed our homes were calmer, more peaceful places. His word choices for spanking could have been better. No one wants to ""switch"" their children, but the idea behind his teaching is beneficial to anyone who loves their children and wants what's best for them."
1,Reading this book makes me want to cringe and just give my son a hug.,"This book is sickening. The teachings make me want to shield my son from the radical abusive crazies that are capable of selling this book to so many people. Children have died from this book, endured abuse and torture, made to fear their families. Its all just so horrible. Reading this book makes me want to use it as fire kindling and go give my son a hug instead a beating. If you are considering using this as a child-rearing guide, my advice would be to look into other less extreme methods of parenting."
1,Reprehensible,"As a special educator of students diagnosed as emotionally disturbed, I can assure you that the parenting recommendations contained in this book are quite simply, dangerous and destructive to society. Yes, this may work for some children, and not leave them emotionally scarred, and yes, a parent may be able to utilize this book without ever raising a switch. However, the recommendations in this book are far from best practices for building strong, trusting relationships with children, as the many personal testimonies in these reviews reveal. It is possible to manage the behavior of any child, no matter how wild they may act, without ever raising your hand to strike them. The techniques in this book are, at best, archaic and barbaric."
1,Amazon please STOP selling this book!,"As others have stated, this book condones and even gives the prescription for the physical abuse that killed Hana Williams, an innocent child. PLEASE Amazon be responsible and STOP selling this book!"
1,Jesus has flowing tears knowing parents beat their kids,"This book is way over the top of what the bible teaches. Please do not buy this book! God instructs discipline and obedience for parents and child. Do not take literally the ""rod"". It's figurative speech. There are other ways to accomplish discipline and obedience. GIving a child LOVE, hugs, tenderness, and values is way more effective than a switch, rod, belt, etc. which teaches absolutely nothing of value and teaches that abusing others is okay. It's not! These other beating methods would make God cringe and cry to know his precious children are being beaten. These methods only create resentment to which the children grow up to beat and torture other people thinking that behavior is okay. I pray to God, use your common sense and your internal wisdom and PLEASE spare the children of this atrocity!"
1,Violation of human rights,"As a mother from Germany, I accidentally stumbled over this book when reviewing books about sleep training. It was only a few clicks from Ezzo's ""On Becoming Babywise"" to this one.I am shocked and horrified. The USA seem to the ""land of unlimited possibilities"" in every regard. How can it be possible tohave something like this published. This book clearly violates human rights and is an appeal to abuse children. It leaves me speechless ..."
1,Garbage!,"Don't buy it. Don't read it. This book is garbage and I pray for every child who is being subjected to this kind of ""discipline"". It's sickening."
1,A guide to abusing your child mentally and physically,"I am shocked and horrified that this book exists... following the steps in this book is a sure way to cause permanent psychological and physical harm to a child. The authors gleefully admit to their abuse, and with a malicious joy describe in excrutiating detail how to cause harm to those who cannot defend themselves."
1,This book is being linked to the deaths of two children,"This book is being linked to the deaths of two children. Please read the accompanying news story prior to ordering. Child abuse is not ""parenting.""[...]"
1,This book disgraces Amazon's good name,"The child ""training"" methods Pearl advocates are abusive and illegal in many places, and their application could result in having a child removed from the abuser's custody.Where is Amazon's responsibility in this matter, morally and legally?"
1,Disgusting Guide to Abuse,"I am appalled that Amazon would allow this trash to be sold through their store. This book advocates abuse from the time a child is 4 months old! How anyone could say that is OK is beyond me. According to this abuse manual, the younger the child the easier to ""train"".I have three childen ranging in age from 18 months to 14 years old, I have never had to resort to violence with any of them and they are all well behaved good kids. Sometimes they do speak their own mind, sometimes we do have a battle of wits - and ya know what, sometimes they win! There is nothing wrong with that. I am thrilled to be raising happy kids that enjoy life, as opposed to the ""obdient"" trained dogs that this book advocates.As someone that grew up being ""trained"" I know first hand that the only thing abusive training does is teach children to fear and loathe their parents.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for parenting advice, these ""authors"" should be in jail, not making money off this junk."
4,to train up a child,this book has helped shape a good training ground for our children in the area of obedience. it has helped us understand the difference between lazy parenting and consistant parenting to shape our children into obedient adults. it has also helped us understand what it mean to overly punish our children in a harmful/abusive way. i have learned more about how to truely love my children in teaching them about obedience rather than ignoring the disobedience and letting them have their way or say areas of their life that would be counter productive to them later in life.
5,Common Sense,"This is an excellent guide on the training and appropriate disciplining of children. In M. Pearl's words, the ""simplicity of training"" is exactly what this book discusses. His approach to discipline is loving, biblical, and matter-of-fact, rather than being driven by emotions or ineffective punishments. The book is a study in common sense when disciplining children. The child training he explains teaches children the concept of consequence, and empowers parents by helping them to maintain control of their emotions while disciplining children. I've used the techniques in this book while training all 3 of my children and highly recommend it."
1,Just wrong.,"How can anyone sell this book or endorse its teachings? The principles in it are just WRONG, as are those who support it in any way, including allowing its sale here on Amazon. I say a special prayer right now for all the children affected by this book and the teachings of the Pearls.Father God, protect and guide them through the abuses they endure in Your name. I pray these children will grow up knowing that what is happening is WRONG and that You are not the one inspiring their parents to do these things to them. I hope they know that You weep with them and feel the sting of every switching. We know that you, Jesus, endured the whippings and the cross for us so that we would not have to. Thank you for dying for our sins. Please protect these children God, and please let them know that you are LOVE, not abuse. In Jesus name, Amen."
5,Training is Key,"I found the point of the book overall to be LOVE your child. It seems an obvious statement, but the hard part for most parents is - how is that done best? How do Dad and Mom properly train their children in love without becoming angry or frustrated? The key is training. With this and the other principles of this book, I've seen my children become more creative, kind and hard-working, and have found that the tantrums and attitude problems have dwindled. All children are still riddled with sin issues - but dealing with the obedience through training in the beginning is key. The Pearls give great insight after having five of their own children, into how to do this. It changed the way I parent. We are so appreciative to have read this book at such an early stage in our parenting."
1,"I wouldn't treat an animal that way, let alone a child.",An emphatically negative review for a book that perpetuates crimes against children - stemming from ignorance and indistinguishable from malice. No reputable animal behavior book would encourage treating a living being this way - let alone doing it to your own child.
1,Why are these authors not in prison?,"These people, by their own admission, have committed child abuse on their own and other children in their care, and continue to advocate it. Child abuse is against the law. Why are they not in prison? Anyone who follows their advice should have their children removed from their care and be sent to a chain gang, no cushy prison for them!"
5,Awesome solutions book,"I have read this book 8 years ago and used it since.Awesome, practical, useful and down to earth. We are alot better parents because of this book and our children are our pride and joy."
1,How to kill a baby,"One woman followed the advice given in this book and beat her baby to death.I have to put up 20 words, so this is the rest. You can buy this book, beat your baby to death and join her in prison too."
1,Book advocates child abuse.,This book advocates child abuse of both a mental and physical nature. Is your child having trouble potty training? Punish him with cold baths. Crying? Beat the kid.This book is amazingly horrible to your child's development and well-being.
1,Disgusting ancient propaganda,"This is an ACTUAL quote from the author:""I am sorry the psychologists and secular child advocates don't get it, but then if all parents practiced child training as I have suggested, there wouldn't be any need for abnormal psychologists or child protection agencies. A lot of people would move on to more practical kinds of work, and there wouldn't be any more crime or war.""You know what? I think selling this book is ok. That way, Child Protective Services can just check who bought the book and take their children away. Would make their job a whole lot easier.I can't believe Amazon actually still carries this!"
1,This is just sick,"I'm not 100% against some forms of corporal punishment in relation to child rearing, but this is just sick. More proof once again that religion and stupid people shouldn't mix.To quote: ""if you have to sit on him to spank him, then do not hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are bigger, tougher.""Wow .. sick!"
5,Raising Joyfull Children!,"This book is a godsend! I have been using the principles for the last 4 years and there really is no better way to train you kids. People who have written negative reviews either have not actually read the book, or had parents who did not truly follow the wisdom of the book. Micheal Pearl is very specific about NOT abusing your kids, so people who read the book and then discipline with anger and an iron hand are doing it out of their own depravity, not by the instruction of the book. You must read it from start to finish, do not pick and choose parts! The first thing you must do according to the Pearls is to 'tie strings' with your kids. strings of fellowship, so they know how much you cherish them. All 'spanking' is done calmy and is never 'out of control' or angry. There is never any time to be angry with your kids when you follow this book! It's great!"
1,reall??,"ok,I just read inside this book. One page, and I wanted to throw up. He teaches that you should ""discipline before there is a problem"" to ""train"" your children. He states ""children do not need to be able to reason, even dogs and rats can be trained"" he more than once compares the training of a child to the training of horses and dogs. also, he praises the mother who's child was so ""well trained"" she didn't come in the room when she was injured by another child and recieved a large knot on her head. But complains about the mother who's child would come in if it were hungry or had a conflict with another child. I think this should be ripped off the shelves. This man doesn't want children he wants obiediant robot drones and I pitty his 5 children and the way they must have been raised."
1,To Train Up A Child,"Simply put: disgusting.Someone should seriously consider using these ""training"" methods on the author. When he wakes up from the beating, the ""training"" should recommence."
1,Horrifying,"""Because its in the Bible"" is not a defense for abusing your child. The Bible is not the source for educated, well-informed thinking, its a source for allegory and faith. People seeking real-world advice or training from such a source are misguided to say the least. I am fine with a small tap to show a young child they have done something wrong, but the use of switches and ongoing abusive treatments described by this book are well over the line. Children of today need structure and discipline -- not abuse. This book is nothing more than an excuse of child abuse through archaic religious ideas which were not meant to be taken literally to begin with. Shameful."
5,"A Series for God Fearing, Loving Families Who Understand What Biblical Discipline Should Look Like","I have absolutely loved having this series of books in our library for quick referencing when issues arise. I would recommend them all. Unfortunately I was not introduced to them before I had children. If you lack in the creative teaching areas as I do, this book can certainly help you there."
1,These people are SICK,"We received this Child Abuse Instruction Manual for Christmas. After reading the first 6 pages my wife and I were horrified. Anyone who would advocate hitting a 6 month old baby, pulling hair, whipping with a rubber hose, hosing down your kids in the yard in the cold, and other abusive acts should be in jail. I am saddened that Amazon carries this disgusting piece of trash written by disgusting, evil people. The so called ""authors"" have no education in theology or child rearing. They bastardize the bible and justify their child abuse by hiding behind the veil of ""God's Word"".We are also at a loss as to how to approach the family member that gave us this book and is using it on their own child.Amazon, PLEASE DUMP THIS BOOK."
1,"Here's the truth for all of you so-called ""loving parents""","If you bought this book and utilize it, you're a deplorable excuse for a parent, and you shouldn't have children at all.God is love, and he doesn't rule by fear.Why would you even think to follow the words of such disgraceful human beings?Amazon, you should probably remove this book before more children are beaten to death."
1,disgusting,"i'm appalled that this book even exists! it's depraved, sick, and utterly shameful. i hope that if people are having difficulty with their children and/or the behavior their children are exibiting they exercise more reason and educate themselves further. utilizing the techniques in this book would result in having severely disturbed children/families. there are so many books that help families without relying on torture and abuse. please keep looking!"
1,"instructions for child abuse, this book deserves a negative star rating.","This book is instructions for nothing but child abuse. Every psychologist and pediatrician would agree it's an example of how to raise a child in the most unhealthy of ways. The point is to teach children to unquestionably submit to authority, by beatings with an assortment of objects starting at the age of 6 months (seriously), starvation, and multiple other cruel and inhumane methods that are described as the same methods the Amish use to break stubborn mules.The authors are currently in trouble over that fact that several small children have been murdered through torture by their parents, who were following directions of the book.This is a horrible book and anybody who follows it needs serious help, and a miracle to save their children from them."
1,Couple in CA beat their daughter to death applying this book's principals,"[...]Kevin and Elizabeth Schatz applied the principals in this book, beat their adopted daughter to death, and put another adopted daughter in the hospital with critical injuries. Kevin is serving a life sentence and will be eligible for parole in 2034. Elizabeth will serve 13 years; at least her kids will be grown by the time she gets out of prison. Want to learn their parenting skills? Buy this book."
1,The definitive guide to beating infants and toddlers.,"Do you want to beat your infant but aren't sure how to do it? Are you itching to give your three year old a whipping but aren't sure where to start? Do you want someone to validate evil and even criminal acts of child abuse so that you can give in to those nasty urges to beat and dominate a person 1/10th your size and still claim to be Christian? Are you sick of rummaging through the house looking for the right thing to smack a kid with?- then have I got the book for you. To Train up a child will teach when to beat, how to beat, what to beat with and make you feel good for doing it.Sure some kids have died but don't let that deter you. Yeah, some parents are in prison but think of all the righteous fun they had smacking around tiny souls who depended on them before the convictions.And yes, sadly, I have read this book.On the other hand if you are not a deeply disturbed aspiring child beater, maybe this isn't the book for you."
1,Horrifying,"Reading this book made me cry. The scripture is twisted. The 'advice' simply a manual for 'how to abuse your child'. As an early childhood professional I was horrified to think of children being treated in such inhumane ways. Understanding child developmental stages, boundary setting and treating children like valued human beings is a much more sane way to get children to behave appropriately. If you are ever given this book, burn it - please. Your children will thank you."
1,Pet training for children - Insanity!,This ridiculous approach to child rearing should be archived with other bizarre and outmoded rhetoric from the dark ages. No one with an ounce of true compassion for his fellow human would take this garbage serious. This couple should write how-to pamphlets for adults that enjoy beating each other and leave child raising to the normal and loving parents.
1,To Train up a victim,"Terrible. A Child-Abuse Manual. These people should go to jail for this. Badly written drivel. Substitute the word ""baby"" or ""child"" for any other member of society and see how it reads. It is a book that supports the victimization of innocents. It promotes the beating of little lambs. The images of Jesus we see in our culture show him being kind and gentle to children. We see him gently holding a lamb. When raising your children and loving them, think What Would Jesus Do?"
1,This Book Is SICK,I would never recommend this book to anyone! The Pearls teach abusive ways of raising children. They recommend taking a swithch (pipe thread) to a 5 month old baby. They think it is okay to make a young toddler stand out in the ice and snow all day and watch their father work to learn that chores must be done! If someone is looking for real discipline advice I suggest you read a book on positive discipline. This book shouldn't even be sold in my opinion!!!!!!
3,Helpful,This book gives very practical and common sense advice in how to raise up children. As any other book you should interpret and use what you think is good.
1,Just Wrong,"I understand spanking a child when you have to, but you do not beat your children! You do not use pipes or anything other than your hand. Listening to these horrible stories tells me the people who wrote this book are not Christians, but people who think they know know how to raise children. They do not know their butts from a hole in the ground. They are horrible people that just want to make money for their own personal greed instead of truly helping people!"
1,I am shocked that Amazon would continue to sell this book!,"This book is a clear instructional manual for child abuse and shouldn't be sold ANYWHERE, much less on Amazon which prides itself on it's reputation. Beating and starving a child?! Its against the law to even treat CRIMINALS like this and yet so-called ""God-fearing"" individuals are advocating this sort of ""training"" for children?! They're not animals; you don't train them, you love them and raise them with respect for themselves and others. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves. How has it taken this long, with multiple reports of child death attributed to this book, for Amazon to remove this book from their site? I refuse to shop on Amazon until this book is gone and I have no problem spreading the word to everyone I know."
1,Don't read this book!,"I would not recommend this book to anyone. As a christian, I don't feel like the Pearls way of training is very Godly. I serve a God of grace, mercy, and love. Nothing in this book shows grace, mercy, or love. I don't serve a God who dangles things in front of me only to smack me when I reach for it. I could not trust a God who does that, nor could my children trust me if I did those things to them. God wants us to love and honor and extend grace to those around us, as he has done for us. And this book does not teach you to do that. The Pearls way of training is not the way that God teaches and trains us, so why would we want to use their methods on our kids?"
1,Second child dies after parents follow Pearl's advice.,"In February of 2010, a seven-year-old girl was found beaten to death in Paradise, California. This was the second such death attributed directly to the use of the techniques in this book, which recommends getting a switch ""free of knots as not to break the skin"" to use on infant children. Older children are advised to be whipped with plumbing tubing. This is the tool with which this little girl was beaten to death. Her 11-year-old sister was in kidney failure at the time due to hours-long beatings also. The other children in the house also told of similar abuse.For parents looking for advice on Christian parenting, remember that Christ would never have brutalized children in this manner. These people are profiting by promoting child abuse and this time it ended in another death."
1,Garbage,This book is complete garbage written by a hillbilly and any book that has been used in murder investigations is no book to use...
1,To Train Up A Child,Why are you selling such a horrid book? A seven year old girl was beaten for seven hours and did not survive! The child was adopted by religious fanatics who purchased this book. No wonder our country is in such a dispicable state....beating children in God's name! These authors should be jailed!!!!!!
1,special place in Hell for these people,I am a pediatrician and I am shocked that Amazon carries this horrific book. These animals advocate beating babies as young as 4-6 months. I don't know how these two have not been incarcerated for committing child abuse and for promoting child abuse. They claim to be Christians. What would Jesus do? He certainly would not practice the principles in this book. Satan has a special place in Hell for these criminals.I am seriously considering never buying another item from Amazon again as a way to protest the selling of this evil garbage.
1,Evil Book,"I have not read this book but have heard of these evil people. In any other country i belive they would have been locked up for endorsing child abuse,so come president Obama lock Pearl and his b**** of a wife up and throw away the key. Let them rot in jail,the death penalty is too good for them."
1,I can't believe that people follow this book.,This book is an excuse for child abuse! Terror is not an effective tool. I am saddened by what people do in the name of religion.
1,Sadistic!!!,I wouldn't waste my precious time on this piece of rot!If you are honestly wanting help with your child this is not the book to do it. No self-respecting parent with an ounce of decency and human compassion would take anything in this book seriously. The writer of this book should be charged if this is indeed the way he treats his own children.I've only given it one star because it was required.Don't bother!
1,Child Abuse,Child abuse. Read the Seattle Times article.. plain and simple.May the disturbed creators of the religion and book die the way they recommend people treat their children.May you rot in hell.
1,Child Abuse is never good,"Any adult who advocates child abuse as a form of parenting is wrong. Words cannot express my disgust and nausea about this book. You train animals; you instill values in children by teaching them through your actions and words. Hitting babies and children, with plumbing instruments, IS NEVER ACCEPTABLE. Any ""parents"" who think it is permissible should be ashamed of themselves. This is not a message from the Good Lord, but a trap set by the devil. And look at the number of people falling for it. Dear Pearls, maybe YOU should be beaten with some plumbing line."
5,Great resource!,I read this 20+ years ago and have raised my children on these and other Godly principles. This is in NO WAY abusive - purposeful parenting and child-training. Loving parents discipline with love and compassion. This is what the Pearls advocate.
5,Best child training book you'll ever read,"This book gives excellent, practical advice in child training. It is encouraging and it deals with much more that just training children to be obedient... It ultimately deals with raising confident, well-adjusted adults. Do not be fooled by the liberal media and their confused liberal agenda... this book has nothing to do with child abuse. No open-minded adult can read this book and reach the conclusions that liberal journalists claim it teaches. It deals with reaching a child's heart and training them to be self-controlled and high in self-esteem. Very well written."
1,Absolute Filth,"This book (To Train Up A Child)is simply a step by step guide on how to abuse small children in the most evil and hideous ways. I am sickened that a book like this is allowed to be sold and amazed that the authors have not yet been arrested. They describe and recommend beating their own babies bare skin, pulling the hair of feeding infants as well many other sickening, distressing crimes. Please dont buy this book, it is written by truly evil people."
1,How many more children must die?????,"How many more children will die because of this book? Rest in peace, Sean Paddock, Hanna Williams, and Lydia Schatz. Your blood is on the hands of your murderous parents and on the hands of these despicable authors."
1,Why doesn't Amazon sell Child Porn,"Because it against the law even though it is an expression of ""Freedom of Speech"". This book on Creative Child Abuse should be banned with the child porn -- it is not freedom of speech --it is a manuel on abuse."
1,Abuse,This seems to be a manual for child abuse ....whipping a child of four months? ...Spare the rod does not apply here .. the authors have no credentials as Christians nor as purveyors of child development...perhaps as Monsters..but Gomez would be appalled.
1,Is this for real?,"Please don't give these freaks anymore money than they have already made off the back of their child beating services to parents. Anyone who thinks it is ok to punish a four month old(????) physically or otherwise is quite clearly insane and should not be allowed to raise their own kids, let alone sell books telling others how to raise theirs. (...)"
1,Disgusting filth written with the higest degree of ignorance,"All i have to say is, anyone who whips or hits a 4 month old child is pathetic, and insecure in their own lives. This is just one of the things these people encourage in this sorry excuse for the hicks guide to beating your kids. Humans are not TRAINED, we LEARN!"
1,Cruelty mixed with common sense,"This book as others have said contains much common advice for parenting. However, it loses credibility with the acts of cruelty also contained in the book, some of which may be categorized as abuse. To intentionally pull the hair of a nursing child because they have teeth is not good parenting."
1,"If you want a child that never questions, this is your book","But why not just buy a doll? A doll won't ever touch anything you don't want it to, it won't ever ask questions, it won't ever dare to cry!But if you are a parent of a real, live human child stay as far away from it as you can."
1,Please stop selling this book!,"While the book itself cannot be blamed for the horrible actions of the parents who owned it, selling this book cannot be seen as a responsible action. How can a six month old respond to ""discipline"" of this nature? The basis of this type of advice is completely erroneous and not founded on any reputable research. As a pediatric nurse, it saddens me to see abusive ""parenting techniques"" being hailed as responsible discipline. Anyone who has read the horrific reports of abuse and the tragic results of these actions by some of the parents who owned this book would have to agree this advice is at least flawed and at most criminal."
5,Love this book!,"This book is so practical and it changed the way I looked at raising my children. I read this book, coupled with the Pearl's DVD set titled The Joy of Parenting. If you follow the Biblical principles outlined in this book, it will change your attitude as a parent. There will be less frustration with disobedience and so much laughter and joy in your home. Never does Mike Pearl suggest ""hitting"" your children, as his critics would like to say. The media has, as usual, taken words out of context and completely misrepresented the truth. My children are happy, well adjusted, and do not have any negative feelings toward us as their parents. They have never been hit or abused in any way. In fact, the principles outlined in this book completely take any anger or yelling or impatience out of your parenting lifestyle. It is a joyful way to live."
1,Wait a minute....,How many kids have died as a result of the abuse that was inspired by this book??? Have you seen these guys? They are backward hicks living in the hills who can barely speak good english. I'm surprised they know how to write. And people are beating their children to death because these red necks say to?!?
1,Yet another child abuse & murder case due to this book,"Amazon, you MUST remove this book!!!! Yet another child has been murdered due to torture, reported today. The parents followed the ""training"" of this book!!!! It's horrific and senseless!!!!"
1,This is just plain creepy,"Read this article about how this book is linked to child abuse.[...]This book does not teach us how to love as God loves. It teaches us how to be distorted, abusive, and drunk on our own power. Sick"
1,The Pearls Advocate for Child Abuse,"This book is toxic and advocates for child abuse. It is disgusting that Amazon continues to sell this book and others like it. This is not ""training"" a child, but breaking them. Lydia Schatz died after her parents followed this guidelines in this book. The Pearls give detailed information on how to beat your child with flexible plumbing line. Sure, they don't advocate ""spanking"" they advocate using objects other than a hand to beat your child into submission.If there is a hell, I hope that Michael and Debi Pearl wind up suffering for all eternity while being beaten with a 1/4 flexible plumbing line, just like they describe in this book."
1,Problematic,"This book actually advocates abuse not discipline. Children are to be taught and discipline can be a part of that but this crosses several lines. Especially what it says about infants. Babies are innocent and not capable of understanding right and wrong so hitting them is pointless and disgusting. Hitting them until they accept the pain and give up ""their anger"" is just sick. Save your money and your kids. Look elsewhere."
1,"Could there please be a ""-5 stars"" option? I need that option.","The worst thing about this book and the philosophy that drives it isn't that it promotes the physical abuse and emotional neglect of our precious little ones, but that it insists God wants us to do this. (previously a Pearl-follower, now a repentant Mom of many homeschooled, fabulously individual and precocious children)"
1,how to torture and murder a child,"Amazon should drop this book. It has contributed to the torture and murder of children in California & North Carolina. It is so misdirected it takes my breath away. Disciplining a 6-month old? This people obviously don't know anything about human development and the damage they do to young souls in their ignorance. How so-called Christians end up so far away from God is beyond me. Twisted, heinous, the authors should be prosecuted for encouraging child abuse."
5,"A wonderful, well-written book !!!","My husband & I are Christians, and we saw nothing wrong with this book. I read the whole thing, and loved it. I read several pages (here & there) to my husband, and he agreed with it also. There is nothing in this book that is non-Christian, nor spiritually harmful to a child. Too many people think that spanking is horrible ... but it's not. That's what children need these days !!! They are too spoiled, and are disrespectful to adults. I'm not afraid to spank my children, and neither should anyone else. A disciplined switching/spanking accompanied by a verbal explanation/correction is NOT abuse. I have a 12 yr old & a 2 yr old. They stress me out everyday, but this book helped me a whole lot. This book explains everything with love & wonderful explanations. I have already recommended it to several people, and will continue to do so. It is a lot shorter (less pages) than most parenting books out there, and very easy to read (not boring)."
1,"abuse, plain and simple...","There really is nothing more for me to say, this is just pure child abuse, and misinterpretation of the Bible to try and justify said abuse."
1,Stop this abuse,This book should not be allowed in print. It is promoting the abuse of children. It makes me ill to think that someone would recommend and do what they are suggesting. Loving your child and behaving as you would want them to behave is the answer.
1,You have got to be kidding me( negative star review),Anyone who treats their child like this author suggests needs to be investigated for child abuse. No child deserves to be treated like that. If you do not want to deal with the life changes having a child brings about DO NOT HAVE ONE. This book is garbage DO NOT buy it.
1,I feel like thorwing up!!!,"I'm going to make this plan and simple. The Pearls are sick sadistic people who should not be allowed to have children, let alone give advice on how to raise them. They believe in child abuse not love and compassion. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Please don't buy these books,"A boy in NC died because his parents followed certain teachings of the Pearls. I read To Train Up a Child on the advice of my MIL. Any father who would purposely push their baby into a pond to teach them to stay out of it, should not be writing child training books. Babies should not be hit. I'm sure they mean well, but this is not the only way to ""Train"" your children. If you are going to read it please do so cautiously and prayerfully."
1,Child rearing or abuse?,I have not read the book in its entirety but the excerpts I have read point out that abuse is the proper way to raise a child. I don't recommend any book that promotes hitting your children and breaking their will.
1,Misguided book that rationalizes child abuse,"Yes, we all want to guide and train our children to be decent human beings. Why on earth would anyonebelieve that hitting a child is a sensible way to teach them anything? Hitting teaches only violenceand fear. Usually, when a parent hits, it is for their own selfish purposes--to vent frustration, rageand fear about their own failings as parents. This book encourages to bend the will of God, in their own minds, to match their own violent and rageful tendencies. This is not how we raise children.There are plenty of great books by Dr. Sears and others--about being great disciplinarians and loving stewards of our child's lives. Please, do not hit your children. There are so many other ways to teach your children.We are better than this!"
1,To Train Up A Child,"As a foster mother, I find this book to be beyond disturbing. This isn't about Christian anything, this is about extreme abuse methods being taught under a ""Christian"" label.The Pearls are dangerous and their poison needs to be stopped."
1,If I could have given given the book 0 stars I would have,"I will keep this review short and sweet. I have read the book. I have a husband, child and dog. I wouldn't train my dog this way, and if I did they'd come and take the dog. Therefore, using these methods on a child are inhumane - pretty simple.I think CPS should do a home visit to all who gave a positive review. Surely, they could subpoena Amazon for the names and addresses."
5,from a teen -- Praise for TTUAC,This is what parents today need to learn. The families that I have seen train their children following the Bible are much happier than the families whose kids are ENTITLED. Those kids are NOT fun to be around! To Train Up a Child is based on Biblical Truths.
1,STOP SELLING THIS BOOK Amazon,"Another example of man using God as an excuse to act like a brute. Parenting is a great responsibility that should be taken seriously, children are not dogs to be broken. How many kids need to die before this book is destroyed."
1,"Abuse, plain and simple.","If you want to learn how to abuse and neglect your child, this is a good book for you. If you are like me, and love your child way too much to even consider such a thing, stay FAR AWAY from this book. It is not discipline, it is not guidance, it is abuse. You can raise a happy, healthy, well-adjusted and obedient child without using any of the techniques in this book - I have raised 4 such children!Keep in mind that this author has written another book that has a warning against it by the American Medical Association. He has no training and no credentials behind the claims he makes."
1,This is a very dangerous book.,"I have read this book (more than once). I am a fundamentalist Christian. I followed the advice therein for a little while, as I was a new parent/Christian at the time; I also received and followed the advice in their No Greater Joy newsletters. However, I have since carefully and prayerfully subjected this contents of this book to the scrutiny of God's Word, and it came as a shock to me that it comes up very short. The scripture is taken out of context and is badly twisted. There is just enough truth to make it sound very good, and it preys on the parents' good intentions and wishes for ""perfect"" children. Beware of the wolf in sheep's clothing. Following the advice in this book will, at best, damage your children spiritually. That is my personal experience, not an opinion."
1,SCARY!!!,What is the matter with these people? I wish people would study the BIBLE instead of the Pearl books. They are NOT the same!! It literally breaks my heart. Please will someone put an end to the cycle of abuse! Immature parents grab this book praying it will produce 'perfect' children. There is NO such thing! There are far better resources out there. Please DO NOT purchase their books. Try Heartfelt Discipline by Clay Clarkson. He actually studies the scriptures and what the Hebrew texts are saying. Please Please Please!!!!
1,I've raised 10 amazing children without the use of this book,"There was a woman visiting our church who described her 'parenting' methods to the rest of us moms and made us all cringe. She left a 3 or 4 month old baby in her care crying for food for so long, without even checking on him, that we other moms finally picked him up and fed him behind her back. For that and a bunch of other things I witnessed I ended up reporting her to social services for child abuse. This book is her favorite. There is a lot better stuff out there, don't let your search end here."
1,Striking an infant is child abuse,"Striking any child under the age of 2, for any reason, is completely inexcuseable. These people should be arrested, period. Never believe that hitting a baby is justified. Babies do not cry because they are being ""tyrranical"", or because they are being bad.This book goes beyond spanking. It's not about discipline at all, it's about dominating your children...in the same sick, evil way that a rapist dominates their victim."
1,"Please do not buy this book,,,it is horrific...","Horrible,,,for example...On p.46 the Pearls say that if a child does obey before being whipped, whip them anyway. And ""if you have to sit on him to spank him, then do not hesitate. And hold him there until he is surrendered. Prove that you are bigger, tougher."" ""Defeat him totally."" On p.80 they recommend giving a child having a tantrum ""a swift *forceful* spanking."" On the same page they say to whip small children on their bare skin until they stop screaming. ""Don't be bullied. Give him more of the same."" They say to continue whipping until their crying turns into a ""wounded, submissive whimper.""children need love like any other creature, this is completley horrifying."
1,I pray for any child exposed to this torture,"As a child that grew up in an abusive household, this book makes my stomach turn and heart ache. I truly wish child protective services would track down those raving about beating their children into submission by beating them with rods and take them away. I have a 4 month old, and in this book they advocate beating them on the back of the legs with a switch at 4 months old. I began crying once I read that for that poor defenseless newborn baby who was being beaten. This book is pure evil. It is not the word of the God I know or any God I would ever pray to. This is not Christianity. This is Child Abuse. This is Evil, and illegal. Those who apply these practices will get judged by God for their sins."
1,There are better ways to discipline.,"You don't train up a child. You raise a child, love a child, respect a child, and give them the wisdom you have. This book advocates beating a child, and recommends tools for this based on ""not damaging the muscle or bone"". So abuse is okay as long as it's not debilitating?There are better ways to discipline."
5,To Train a Child,"Bought It. Read It. Understood it!! People trashing the pearls either have not read it or not understood it. Wish I would have had it when I was growing up and parents who cared enough to train me so that my life would have reflected more self discipline. The Pearl's message is being taken totally out of context and ""the proof is in the pudding"". Ignore your children and see what you reap! Let others guide your children and see where it gets you. Wonderful, truthful message with love at its core. Child abusers will misuse anything to justify their wicked actions."
5,loving and joyful home,The Pearls really teach how to have a loving and joyful home. And enjoy raising the children God blessed us with. If anyone misunderstands that it is there selfs to blame. I enjoy this ministry and their sweet joyful hearts.
1,Thoughts of someone whose mother used this book,"My mother was given this book while I was a child. Wanting to raise a well-behaved child, she would spank me with a belt. She is proud of me. I am a senior at Princeton University and practicing Catholic. However, today my mother would tell you that I am these things in spite of the teachings of ""To Train Up a Child,"" in spite of the self-loathing and insecurity caused by whippings which would not end until I could pretend to be content. Pretend to embrace the necessity for my own torture.I was abused. Please do not look to this book for guidance."
2,"Unrealistic characters, crass dialogue, good court drama","I only finished this book because it was for a book club--otherwise I would have set it aside for good during the first 10 pages! The character development is extremely weak in the book. The characters are either too good to be true or the scum of the earth--absolutely no subtlety here. Also, the author seems to have an adolescent male view of women's sexuality--in other words, he is totally unrealistic and it reads like a cheap, sleazy romance novel at times! Our book club was uniformily unimpressed by the book and agreed we wouldn't read any more of his works. The second half of the book improves as the author enters his element--the justice system. But, overall, the book is unrealistic and very predictable. Thumbs down here!"
3,heartbreak,"a collision of two grim yet important topical subjects-child molestation and troubled youth. halfway through the narrative, the grayness between justice and law wells up. choppy pacing,melodramatic,teary tone and irish catholic religiosity."
3,Wonderful introduction to a neglected genre.,"A great book, which I have enjoyed several times over the years... though having revisited it recently I was slightly less enthused as an adult perspective revealed a synopsis-collage with lite postulations, both obvious and far-fetched, which gloss over the themes indicated by the book's title. My adult prejudices aside, it is nonetheless a fascinating and inclusive (per it's impressive range) overview of the topic, with great bits of information on varying films both famous and obscure. A worthy edition to any horror film collector's library, though it will be most appreciated by younger readers and those looking for a solid first encounter with the horror film genre as a whole."
3,I am going to try again,"I didn't particularly enjoy this book. The writing was great, and the plot was interesting, but the character of 'Krissy' was not to my liking.The Patterson family goes on vacation in rural, swampy, Florida to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. When their daughter, Krissy, disappears the action of the book picks up.It seems Krissy is the naive participant in the resurrection of an ancient voodoo priest who died in the swamp 200 years ago. The evil spirit of the voodoo priest, known only to Krissy and a Seminole Indian by the name of Jimmy Cypress, has been waiting patiently for his bones to be discovered, so that he can become flesh and continue his reign of terror.I would have really liked this book, except for Krissy. I found her character to be tedious and exhausting. At times I was actually hoping that the voodoo priest would win the battle.I will however read another of Mr.Goingback's books."
2,O.K.,"This isn't a horrible book. It's not William W. Johnstone or Ruby Jean Jensen. It's just average. Cliched writing, hackneyed plot. Not much interesting here."
2,Disappointment,"I picked up this book because the cover promised an author worthy of the Bram Stoker award. I finished it wondering what happened to that author. Although shelved with the adult fiction, this book had a vocabulary and reading style perfect for the juvenile shelves. In fact, with the number of times the author kept repeating himself, the reader wonders if he had an ADD juvenile reader in mind.Beyond that, the book is extremely predictable and the foreshadowing is bluntly obvious. There was nothing especially spooky or horrific in it, and what little might have been there, was so foreshadowed by the author that nothing came as a surprise.If this author was ever worthy of any literary award, it was not for this book. Don't waste your time."
3,"Story gets five stars, the writing gets two...","With ""Evil Whispers,"" it's quite evident that Owl Goingback has a great imagination, which he uses to take you on a fun and scary ride, but...Maybe I'm just being anal-retentive here, but the writing itself comes across as very amateurish to me. There's nothing wrong with simple, straight-forward prose. Hell, I prefer it--that's why I'm such a Bentley Little fan. But the writing in ""Evil Whispers"" is just *too* simple for my tastes. Almost every sentence is written in the passive voice, and he repeats himself incessantly. Hell, RL Stine and Christopher Pike have slightly more sophisticated writing styles, and they write for kids. Also, he used bad grammar in many spots, as in ""it didn't go too good..."" bleh.Still, if you want some quick, non-challenging reading, I'd recommend ""Evil Whispers."""
5,A Good Starter Book,"Although subtitled as a field guide for linguists, I have been using this book as a guide for studying linguistics. It is well set out, full of examples (usually in non indo-european languages) and with cogent English desciptions. A good bibliography, which is frequently referred to, gives further more in depth reading if more understanding is required."
3,Better than I thought,"As long as you're not looking for a plot, the movie's quite fun. Makes me want to read the books."
5,Freaky Deke !,"Deke comes to Nashville a lot, and I try to catch him everytime he's in town. His live shows are always energetic and exciting and just plain fun. I like the Jerry Lee Lewis inspired tracks on the cd and the goofy stuff like My Name Is Deke (and I am freaky ? ). However, he truly shines on the track I Gave My Heart Before. That is the song that made me sit back and say, hey, he's not just a goofball, he has a great voice and he's quite the songwriter. How do you spell fun ? DEKE. Maybe someday he'll get the radio exposure he deserves."
4,A few basic facts,"Before evaluating this book and others like it, two facts needs to be known. First, the Catholic Church has no official doctrinal opinion on whether Jesus was married. Secondly, before the Magdalene was slandered by Pope Gregory in the sixth century as being the prostitute in the New Testament, she had already been sainted and dubbed ""The Apostle to the Apostles.""The four remaining Gospels are silent on whether Jesus married, but any number of other gospels were suppressed for various reasons. It would be wrong to say we have been deliberately lied to for two thousand years. It would be correct to say that no one knows for certain any longer.Theories such as this are interesting. But they are no more or less true than the theory that Christ never married. Until we build a time machine, we're going to have to live with ""I don't know."""
1,Fiction cross dressing as Fact,"One of the sad results of a relativistic society is the loss of common sense. This book and the several others like it (and the Da Vinci Code which plagerizes this fiction), would have us believe that the whole of Western Civilization that has flowered under Judeo-Christianity has been built on a massive fraud. This would mean that EVERYONE has got it wrong for the past 2000 years except the author of this book who has figured out what the rest of the civilized world of scholars and historians have missed about the central figure of Western Civilization - Jesus Christ.Imagine that! Think of all the historical documents, artifacts and scholars who have lived over the past 2000 years and how all these were frauds and controled by the Catholic Church! Astounding that there is a market for this drivel."
2,average,"While I think it's nice to support jazz musicians, this album and pertty much everything else I've heard by Nate Shaw is average (and I HAVE seen him live). If you want to listen to jazz, my advice is to go out and buy a terrific album rather than endure a mediocre one. Don't get me wrong. It's definitely better than Joe ""Hotel Lobby"" Jazzman, but won't really impress anyone who is actually listening. Sorry Nate. Keep playing and everything."
4,From Abingdon Press,"Accepting the widespread view that 1 Thessalonians is the earliest surviving Pauline letter, the author commends reading it as fully as possible on its own terms, without presupposing or imposing themes or positions that are explicit only in letters of a later date. While he agrees with commentators who note this letter's pastoral aims and character, he is more convinced than some that it also exhibits a rich and coherent theological point of view. He interprets 2 Thessalonians as the work of an anonymous Paulinist writing several decades after the apostle's death. He regards this letter, too, as historically and theologically valuable, although less for what it discloses about Paul's ministry and thought than for what it shows about the reception and interpretation of Paul in the late first-century church."
4,Powerful and Insightful,"If you're wondering about how the war on terror is affecting US policy and human rights around the world - then you need to read this book. It is an interesting read that offers important, well thought out arguments, as well engaging stories and surprising statistics. The author of the book is the Executive Director of Amnesty International and his skill at telling engaging stories, which seem to be attributed to his many diverse experiences, is clearly evident in Tainted Legacy."
1,waste of money,"I purchased two of these items for my wifes and my laptops so we could have our speakers and headphones plugged in at the same time, the second you plug both items into splitter the volume go down to almost nothing, unplug on or the other items and the volume returns to normal. Nothing I could do change the way they worked. Just a waste of money for me, maybe someone else will have better luck than I.Monster Ca MUSICSHARE MINI HEADPH-MINI STEREO 1/8IN Y ADPT ( MINIY ST2F )"
2,An work of fiction.,"In Copper Crucible, Jonathan D. Rosenblum sets out to grind his ax and bash the evil ""big business & Corporate giants"". Too bad he didn't tell the rest of the story,... As he fell all over himself demonizing Phelps Dodge and raising Union organizers to sainthood, he conveniently omits the fact that a fully loaded beer truck was the drawing card the union used for its strike meetings. Alcohol just set the stage for the violence to come. And beleive me there was plenty & encouraged by the union. ""Lets get the miners drunk & they will vote how we say"" after all,... its all about power & money -on the union side as well. Copper Crucible may be based on true events, but it certainly does not paint a full true picture."
4,Scent of Eros links pheromones and human sexuality,Very good intro to this field especially for those with some background in biological sciences. Book a little fragmented in presentation and a bit loose with some associations but there is a good deal of take out info that is useful or surely interesting. I think it is important for anyone connected to the human sexuality field.
1,no data,sorry but there is no support for human pheromones. The human brain is great at odors and flavors but probably doesn't do pheromones. See Doty's book.
3,nice info,"this work provides valuable insight into the workings of the human experience. i would recommend it to the novice or the professional alike, and have yet to find its equal."
3,its hard to read,not a fun up beat read all tell you that lol if you can take the fun out of sexuality this guy does it what a fish lol
1,Do not buy this product,"I install it to my Window XP computer, it halt while it was at the half way scanning. Why Cosmi selling this suck software to customers?"
1,This system is weak and did not protect my computer and i dont think it will protect you,"This isnt a very good thing to buy. It says it looks after your computer and deletes spyware and such. This program is ok but it is not the best. It turns out Spyware Killer doesnt spot all of the SpyWare that may be on your computer.It also does not do a very good job deleting the program. I'll give you a example. I spotted a small amount of spyware on my computer and i deleted it or so i thought. I scanned the next day and all of the spware i deleted came back. It isnt very useful also because you have to scan every ten minutes or the spware comes right back.It also does not prevent snooping by tracking spyware, detecting it and removing it before it infects your PC. So please save your time and do not buy this please."
2,Walk past SpyWare Killer - Unless you have joy in wasting $$,"SpyWare Killer protects your computer from malicious files called ""spyware"" which collect information from your computer and send them out on the internet without your knowing. The program does okay at its job, so I assume you get me that I didn't find it very excellent. Sure, it scans your computer adequtuatly for malicious spyware, but it still doesn't beat the two award-winning anti-spyware software, Ad-aware and SpyBot, which offer more complete and detailed scans and which you can download free on the internet (from their web sites) and they constantly update their program and database which means they will be up-to-date and optimized for the best possible protection of your computer.SpyWare Killer is sufficiant at best if you just want to BUY an anti-spyware program. But I highly recommend, for the sake of the protection of your computer info, to go for a more comprehensive, polished, and if not free, anti-spyware software."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this to test against other spyware removers. What a waste of a CD. It has a very outdated database and produced several false positives.You can get Ad-aware from Lavaosoft or Spybot Search & Destroy from safer-networking.org; both are excellent spyare removers and are free.No need to waste your money on this one. I'd give it minus 5 if I could.
5,The pratical methodology for snap-fit mechanism design,"Unlike most of the design reference book, this one gives design engineers very good logical ways, i.e. design methodology, for snap-fit mechanism design. It will avoid the mistakes a young engineer might make, and the writer also provides several very good examples to guide experienced engineers' creativity."
2,Too wordy and academic,"I agree with the other people who said this book repeats itself. It could have been about 1/5th the length and still contained the same amount of information. He spends a lot of time on definitions instead of practical information. After purchasing his book, I found some free snap-fit design guides on the internet that I found much more useful."
5,Classic Carlebach stories,"Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, of blessed memory, was a great story teller and you cannot go wrong reading any collection of the stories."
3,Good Intro...but not that much after that,"I read the book because i am visiting Tikal later in the month and i wanted something that would give me some information about the place.Since there are not that many books on Tikal, i picked up this one.The book is a good introduction for the topic.The description of the place and its buildings is good.The author does a good job in letting us know the purpose and characteristics of every important place in Tikal.But that's basically it.The author doesnt tell us anymore about the Mayas per se.You dont read about their daily lives and the beliefs.Another thing is that, to my impression, the author dwells too much on Tikal relationship with other cities in the area which sometimes made me feel like he was just giving too much importance to the political aspect of TIkal instead of telling us more about Tikal, its people and what happened inside the city.But,again, it is a very good introduction for your studies on the Mayas."
5,Perfect for beginner drawers!,Love this book! I bought this for my daughter and we have all ready spent hours drawing from it! Awesome
3,fair condition,"This book is intact, but it was described exactly as the purchaser mentioned. The purchaser stated there would be creases and the book is used but I got it for a decent price. I am satisfied and I would recommend anyone to purchase from this person."
3,Wait too long but refunded!,"I waited almost 2 weeks and no book, contacted the seller and they did issues a refund. All in all just frustration."
3,Essentials of Geology,"Although this book is full of information, it is a very dry read. The content is lacking anything that would keep attention after a few minutes. Even with the dry lecture, pictures and diagrams are excellent in this book, and help to grasp ahold of the concepts. The CD Rom is a big help, but can't replace the information within the book. Overall, it is a good source of information, and the reading level isn't too difficult."
2,Shoe size narrower than anticipated & leather is very stiff,"I ordered the Sebago mens Dockside and am returning after wearing it just 10 minutes. The shoe is very narrow in width (I ordered an 8 1/2 medium which I wear for all styles of shoe) and pinched the balls of my feet even after loosening the laces. The leather is also very stiff with little play. Lastly, I ordered the shoe in brown and was surprised the color is much lighter than the website photo."
2,Hoped Sebago like Sperry,"Looked like what I wanted, were even comfortable when tried on. Only with extended daily wear does the shoe reveal the lack of finish. Scrapes heel and toes over time. Would not recommend."
3,Good shoes but a major pain to break in,"I bought these hoping they were very similar to the sperry brand. While they look nicer and overall the quaility is better, they are a major pain to break in. I have been wearing them for the past month and they still rub the back of my heel. Despite them looking better, they aren't worth the time nor beat up feet. Spend the extra money and go Sperry Top siders"
3,The shoes squeak like no other!,The shoes constantly squeak against a smooth floor making a loud noise. The charcoal color is also more of a blue than a gray charcoal.
2,VERY Uncomfortable Shoe,Most uncomfortable boat shoe I have ever put on. Inside top of shoe is annoying. Sebago is WAY overrated. I will stick with Timberland.
3,Nice shoe wrong color,I really like the fit of Sebago however the color was not what I was expecting based on the web pic. Didn't dislike it enough to return but I am a little disappointed that color was not as shown!
1,revlon amber waves,not for afro american hair i wouldnt recomend this comb at alldosent get hot enough to get the smooth texture that i was looking for
5,I picked up 3 of these!!!,"When I first got this record it came w/the instrumentals of the entire EP as well. So, I picked it up again (on vinyl)... I have mad love for the production on this that has given me so much joy beat-juggling. Then, I grabbed the CD and just zoned out over the ill lyrics and underground beats. All in All you need to get on this, I'm sure that if you're a fan of good hip hop music, this won't dissapoint."
3,No son Caifanes,"This album is not for everyone. If you want to Caifanes get butchered in the name of modern rock, by all means pick it up. However if you want to hear other artists pay proper respect to Caifanes, don't bother. This CD manipulates every song and tweaks into something that is totally abstract. So if you want to hear an old song with a wierd twist, buy it. But prepare yourself to hear some covers that might offend the Hard Core Caifanes fan."
3,Surviving Your Dissertation: A Comprehensive Guide to content and Process,This book is the beginning of the long journey of writing my dissertation. I have found renewed hope in completing this task of scholarly writing on time.The road map of this guide will enhance my abilites to know what I'm doing & how to do it the right way.
4,Good book,Required reading for someone going through the dissertation process. It is helpful without being overwhelming and contains some good basic information.
4,Critical days...,"Manes Sperber won the German Book Trade Peace Prize in 1984, the year of his death. His unique capacity to describe living history makes ""The Unheeded Warning"" a stirring portrayal of life in Vienna in the 20s and in Berlin in the early 30s. He became attached to Alfred Adler's school of Individual Psychology, was for a time quite active in the Hashomer Hatzair (a leftist Zionist pioneering youth movement) and later an energetic Communist Party member in Germany. The book ends with his arrest -and release- in Berlin shortly after the Nazi rise to power, allowing him to see the easiness with which Reds became brownshirts."
3,A Fine Account of Reform Judaism,"This is a fine account of a man's journey to become a reform Rabbi. Good detail is provided on the purpose of Reform Judaism. The history of the movement is described as well. The personal experiences of Daniel as a little boy are described a little better than when he becomes an adult. You would think that the author would talk a little bit more about his wife's influences. Also, the author could have talked a bit more about his broher who committed suicide. Before the suicide, I do not recall if the author even mentions anything of significance about Michael. Did I miss something? None the less some good points are made which relate to how Reform Judaism deals closely with many modern issues. Worth a look."
1,no detail and some mistake,"The book never go deep into sql even the author promised to do so, it is not a step-by-step guild that dbas can follow, and the seasoned dba also do not need this book because of nothing new.You can see some obvious mistake in this book, for example, about the hash join, Mr. Burleson told us in the page 67 and page 391 that the hash table probe the large table, but oracle document said large table probes the hash table.I hope to see some detail about the analyse of execution plan of table join and scenario, but there is none."
3,discussions with friends were more insightful than this book,"My discussions with my close friends were more insightful than this book. I suppose it was nice to hear stories of other women in similar situations, but I felt that the book was repetitive and could have been summarized in two pages."
5,A life-saver,"I can't say enough good things about this book. I found it about 2 weeks after my wedding was called off and a year later, I still get something out of it. If you just called off your wedding, or are thinking about it, this book will let you know that you are not alone in the myriad of emotions. I have recommended this to so many people, even those who went through the end of a serious relationship, not necessarily an engagement. It will sit next to your bed and you will pick it up at 4 in the morning for comfort."
5,A Lifesaver!,"My wedding was canceled the evening of my bridal shower. I have never in my life felt so alone although I was surrounded by family and friends. The next day my mom bought this book for me. This book takes that ""I am all by myself"" feeling away because it gives a realization that there are others out there that have been/are going through the same thing and same feelings. When one is going through an engagement breakup or trying to figure out if you should break it off, this book helps sort through those feelings and helps answer a zillion questions roaming through your head.My favorite part is reading where others were in their lives in a week, a month, a year, etc from the break-up. It has given me hope that one day I will be okay and there truly is a light at the end of this tunnel.A MUST BUY for ANYONE feeling the pain of calling off a wedding."
5,Must read book for those with doubts.,"There Goes the Bride is a great book for anyone having relationship issues. Whether or not you have cold feet or something more serious, this book is for you. The stories from the Almost Brides are great and really give the feeling that broken engagements and relationship troubles aren't a rare phenomenon.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It's an easy read that's full of information, humor, and resources."
4,Cause Buttons,"I've been collecting Cause Buttons since my first demonstration in 1969, and found this book very informative. It has a good overview of the many types of buttons with an emphasis on Gay/Lesbian buttons. I also liked the price guide that was included."
2,not what it seams,Two pieces of hard plastic. Don't know how long it will survive my teen. Doesn't seem to be the sturdiest thing in the world. Time will tell. Slightly cheesy.
4,great case,I purchased this case and love it. Very strong and durable. I had read that the flip stand was hard to flip open. I have found that all you have to do is place your thumb on the bar on the case at the bottom and press and the stand will open enough for you to open it. Wonderful case.
3,Protect Your Sansa Even From Your View,"Solid case for E200 series Sansa. PROS: Feels solid. Easy to fit Sansa in it. Lanyard included. Back of case is rubberized and prevents slipping on surfaces. CONS: Case is tinted making it more difficult to see display. Flip stand, while functional, is hard to pry open from case if it snaps into its recessed pocket. Sometimes it is so hard to pull out the stand that it requires one to pull apart the entire case from the player and push the stand out from the inside. A good case functionally - would prefer less tint to the cover."
4,It's Terrific,"This is one of eight Rough Riders westerns starring Buck Jones, Colonel Tim McCoy, and Raymond Hatton. As usual the trio is up against tough guy Harry Woods, but Colonel Tim has a plan to get the goods on Woods. At the age of 50, Tim McCoy said adios to this series in 1942 and re-enlisted in the Army. We lost Buck later the same year in Boston's Cocoanut Grove fire. Hatton, who was actually younger than Buck and Colonel Tim, took his loveable ol' geezer character, Sandy Hopkins, into another long-running series of westerns with Johnny Mac Brown."
5,"Perfect ""Mini"" Decanter","This decanter is perfect for the nights where you and your loved one (or a friend) want to share a bottle of wine. This mini decanter is perfect for roughly a half bottle of wine. We have never used a decanter before (simply left our bottles uncorked for a bit), but am very satisfied with this purchase!Keep in mind that this is a ""mini"" decanter (as stated in the title), so if you are looking for a decanter to entertain, or hold an entire bottle of wine, this is not for you."
5,A great buy for two people,"My spouse & I use this with many meals. It adds a nice touch and lets the wine breath, good quality and construction as far we've been able to tell. Of course, it's glass so you have to be careful storing and drying it, you might want to get the metal beads for cleaning. We usually just rinse it out after use. Only negative would be if you're entertaining then this isn't big enough, you'll want a full size one. But it says Mini in the title so it still gets 5 stars."
3,Lee Ritenour & Dave Grusin / GRP All-Stars - Double Time Jazz Collection Vol. 4,"I had part of this performance on a VHS release . It's great to see it again after all these years and with many more tracks . The image is not as crisp as I remember watching it on my then Sony Trinitron (remember that ?) . But the sound is great and the performance is superb . The image is good ... not great . Nevertheless , I recommend it !"
3,Nasal spray,"Thought I had ordered two for one, but it was one for one. Should be better indication at the website."
5,Totally Beatles!,"Just picked up ""Beautiful Beige."" Man, this album should be called ""Magical Mystery Tour II."" The title song, ""Beautiful Beige"" is a killer trac with its looping harmonies and ""Lucy In The Sky"" type word play. My other favorite is ""Vanessa Vargo,"" what a groovy song. This CD is a must have for Beatles fans."
4,Great Pop Music!,"Eddie Starr does a great job interpreting The Cowsills ""Beautiful Beige"" .. thanks Eddie. This is a very enjoyable pop CD with an uplifting message. Loved ""Richest Man in the Universe"" .. both musically and for it's message."
5,Fantastic,I was fortunate enough to hear the title cut while Eddie was working it up for the studio. It's nice to hear something these days that doesn't have that slick overproduced sound too. The lyrics on this album come from experiences and from the heart of a really good man. The harmonies are awesome as usual. A definite must for your collection.
4,"Beatles & Monkees in a Blender, out comes Beautiful Beige...","This is a cool CD. The singer reminds me of John Lennon with a touch of Davy Jones. Very hip, very English sounding. The songs are well written and the recording is top notch. The vocal tracks are layers and layers of sound that weave a pleasant listening experience.The title track is a cover of a song by the legendary group, the Cowsills.I would recommend this CD if you like any of the above mentioned artists.Gene in New York City..."
5,The Trip I Want to Take,"Ever since I read a few books about Lewis & Clark, I've been planning (in my head) a journey out west. This story captures the essence of how I envision my trip. Road rules, no highways, mom & pop restaurants, making new friends along the way.I found this book very well written, fun, and engaging. I was able to feel what I think L&C and Mr. Duncan all felt. The excitement of a new journey, the weariness of such a long trip, and the saddness once the trip ended. I hope I can one-day follow in their footsteps."
4,A Modern Re-creation of Lewis and Clark's Adventures,"This is fascinating reading for all who dream of following in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark and ""discovering"" those parts of the country that we know only in our imaginations. Especially interesting for us ""born & bred"" Easterners."
4,very good,"this antenna is great if you are close to the TV chanels , it worked great for me when I lived only about 20 miles from the TV chanels , but when I moved it wasn't good enough to bring in TV from 60 miles away, so judge for yourself ."
5,Works for me,"While a better antenna solution is aAntennas Direct DB8 Multidirectional HDTV Antennawith aChannel Master 9521A Antenna Rotator, I went with this simpler antenna (actually designed for mobile homes). It had a small multipath problem with some old NTSC stations, but it works fine for HDTV in Tucson with myFull HD 1080p HDMI A/V Switcher Digital HDTV Tuner Receiver Media Box. Comes with powered amplifier that must be outside since that's where my multiple connections meet. I've owned this antenna for over six years."
1,Didn't Work For Me,"I ordered this product online after doing the AntennaWeb scan for stations and antenna types in my area (Charleston, SC). The scan showed that all my stations require red, blue or violet antennas but this antenna is designed for the yellow zone. I tried a quick hookup but it did not receive any of the 14 available stations. It would be very helpful if your discriptions of the antennas available included information about the antenna type color zones!"
1,disappointed,"I don't know if I got a defective antenna or what but I was getting less channels (about 8) with it than I got with a little indoor antenna so I returned the channel master. I would have accepted another one from the seller Black River Distributing but I had to pay return shipping for the one I returned (not refunded). I didn't know if the new one I'd receive would be any better. I was not going to keep on paying unrefunded return shippings. So would I buy this antenna again? Not through Amazon, that's for sure. I still don't know if mine was defective or not. I'd buy it local in a store where it would be possible to return it without having to pay return shipping. Hate paying for NOTHING. This was my first and last experience on Amazon. Going back to ebay. Never lost money there."
1,No replacement of a small part.,"I purchased Channel Master's model 3000A about 2 1/2 yrs ago. It had been working O.K. until a worker accidentally damaged a small part (power supply and injector, model 3037) in January 2011. I saw this part for sale in Channel Master's website. When I tried to order it two weeks later, however, I could not see this item in the same website. I sent email to Channel Master for inquiry, but there was no reply. On Jan 21, 2011 I called Channel Master's client/distributor supp department, and they told me that model 3037 was not available but they would contact me should it become available. To date (March 1) they have not contacted me.The whole antenna (including the expensive job of setting it up and wiring) is useless without this small part.I would recommend this item only to those who are sure that they can keep every small part undamaged forever."
1,"Chinese knock-off junk. AVOID from supplier ""A1 Accesories""","ZERO STARSMaybe different from other suppliers, but from ""A1 Accessories"", this was blatant misrepresentation.THEY ARE NOT in Blackberry Packaging as advertised - they come in a tiny, cheap plastic bag with nothing but a ""Made in China"" sticker in it.These are junk. The 2.5mm jack looks and fits okay, but does not work. I bought two - same problem with both.I have requested a refund from A1 Accessories. Let's see if they can redeem themselves."
2,Doesn't Fit,Please beware that this product doesn't fit all Blackberry phones such as the Blackberry Curve 8310
5,"bought from Accessory One, genuine Blackberry",I bought this from Accessory one for use for home cordless phones. After buying 2.5 to 3.5 mm adaptors that didn't work and several 2.5 mm headset that didn't work. This one worked.Bar code from the bag indicated genuine Blackberry. I don't know about other sellers but Accessory one had the good one.
5,Worth it if you're listening.,"I'm a working jazz pianist in the Seattle area and always looking to get closer to Basie's perspective. If you've got ears and want to see these guys in action, get this disk. Granted, there are some short interviews, but it's a small price to pay to see a slice of the minimal good footage available from these long gone times in jazz history. A player's textbook in black and white!"
1,WHERE'S THE MUSIC?,"What a tease! This is a limited performance disc so don't expect much music. Here are three of the premier Jazz musicians of our day (or anyone else's) and their already limited playing time is constantly chopped short and interrupted by the irritating host, Ralph Gleason, who interviews poorly and should have stuck to writing liner notes. Even the musicians were, obviously, put off by him...with Basie never looking directly at him and 'Trane refusing to even have dialog! Diz proved to be the most patient of the three. What music is permitted has marginal sound quality at best and just when you begin to groove a little, up pops Gleason, again!Hey guys...let's try it ""one more once"". A MUST NOT for any collection!"
3,Really fun Toy - take it with a grain of salt,"This is a very fun toy. It is not state of the art by any means. Nintendo did this stuff with the light gun, powerpad, and punching sensors 20 years ago.2-d motions such as diagonal horizontal and vertical swings yield all your moves in the game. you can block and deflect which is the most fun. fighting jedi opponents seemed kind of random hack and slash with not much strategy.The game itself again, is very fun and will almost make you feel like a jedi and ALMOST make you feel integrated into the star wars universe.My biggest gripe about this product was the 50 dollar price tag. I think 30 dollars and the price would be appropriate.otherwise, you will really enjoy this, except your wrist will hurt badly after about 30 minutes."
4,Gift for Grandson,"Game was purchased for a 10 year old, who ultimately did better than most of the adults who gave it a try. It is very challenging and the varied battle techniques give a good upper body work-out. It takes good hand-eye coordination.We placed the camera/eye on a bar stool and had to elevate on books according to the height of the player."
2,Very Difficult and Kind of Frustrating,"My son got this game with very high hopes, and diligently worked with it for hours, until I noticed that he really wasn't having any fun. After investigating, I discovered that there are some ""moves"" that are almost impossible to pull off, and with the touchiness of the hardware and crummy graphics, success boils down more to random chance than to any kind of skill. In particular, experimentation with the game reveals that accomplishing anything on the left half of the screen is nearly impossible, as the sensor that sits on top of the TV isn't able to detect the light saber when the player moves to the leftmost 30% of its field of view. After reading some of the positive reviews, I can only conclude that either they're cooked up by Hasbro employees or there's something wrong with the unit we bought... If I'd known how frustrating this was going to be for my kid, it would've stayed in the store."
3,Not very much fun,"My husband and son are HUGE Star Wars fans so this was a must have. The problem is that it is insanely hard to use and the calibration never seems to be right. The moves that the Jedi try and teach you are really hard, me and my husband have to do it many times to get it down and for kids thats not fun. I think this toy is way overpriced. I think that 25-30 dollars would be a more reasonable price range considering how well it works. Neither of them had much fun with it and it was forgotten after about a week. Definitely not worth the money!"
1,rent the movie instead,"We spent an hour just trying to calibrate this thing. What a waste of money! My 7 year old couldn't get it. My 10 year old couldn't get it; and I could not get it. The directions were of little help as well. It was more fun renting the movie, or better yet buy the Game boy game for Reveng of the Sith. This game stinks. Back to the store it goes!"
2,Ok,"Well, it was pretty cool at first, like, blocking all the blasters, and other lightsabers, BUT the graphics are horrible and it is nothing like the real thing. The laser blasts have been slowed down a ton, and it is hard to find where your lightsaber is. Furthermore, it broke after I dropped the lightsaber.:-("
4,Fun Game - But it will Challenge you!,"This is a fun game but it is NOT easy because of the sensitivity of the hardware. My 8 yr old son was a bit frustrated trying to complete some of the moves, but it taught him to be patient and keep trying. Overall, it is a worthwhile purchase - IF you have some patience because it is very touchy and will not be easy to master."
1,Waste of Money,"As other rviewers have metnioned this is a ridiculously difficult game for kids to master. The calibration of the lightsaber to the sensor is finicky and frustrating. Two adults, a teenager and a 5 yr old, whose present it was, couldn't make the thing work properly and the frustration levels only increase as the onscreen sensor acts independently, sending you backwards to previous screens without prompting. Then the 'combo' moves have to be exact in a completely inexact system, and it's imposible to advance until they are mastered. Obviously a five year old having to send back a Star Wars toy is a bitter disappointment. I see other reviewers have made it work and enjoyed it, but we're pretty game-savvy in our house and this one was just too annoying. Back to the shop it goes to get traded for something we can actually enjoy."
1,"Disappointing/high, high frustration, impossible for 10 year old","I am SHOCKED at the high reviews here. I had expected to find LOW, LOW ratings. This toy says: for 8+. My son is 10 & he cannot do it. My husband cannot do it. My 12 yr old cannot do it. Yeah, after 1/2 hour one of them will FINALLY master something. That is not my idea of fun OR theirs! This toy has caused a HIGH level of frustration & unhappiness while it is being played in our home.I can't imagine children succeeding with this. I can't imagine why ANYONE would like it-my husband can't do it, either. Bringing this toy into our house has been a bad move--it's no fun for my 10 yr old-but it causes the opposite: HIGH STRESS, FRUSTRATION, DEFEAT-my competitive son is miserable with this.It's almost impossible to do the moves with the light saber device to match the screen."
3,It's okay,"If you want your child to get a little exercise while playing computer games, this is pretty good. The only catch is positioning the ball at the right height and standing the correct distant from the TV. However, there are not many activities so he reached the end of the game pretty quickly."
5,Awesome!!!,My 12 year old son did not ask for this game as a Christmas gift. I saw it on line when I was looking for other Star Wars toys. He is a big Star Wars fan and I am so glad I purchased this game. He is not just sitting in front of the TV playing a video game. He is standing up swinging the light saber to defeat different characters and make it to different levels. I have not seen him play with his PS2 since he has gotten this game. He actually has sore muscles and is sweating after he plays. This is definitely one of his favorite Christmas gifts.
5,Great action toy!,"I purchased this for my son when he was 10yo. He is now 11yo and takes it with him on all his road trips to play in the motels. It's compact, so he can take it with him. He loves the action,a nd it's great on a rainy day to let some of his energy out. Educational by teaching reflexes and hand eye coordination. Very good toy! Worth every penny of it! :)Thanks"
4,Much fun for my 5 year old,"My son absolutely loves this game, as does his brother and 2 cousins. Some of the moves are a bit tough for a young kid, but it sure gives them a work-out. It has proven to be very durable, withstanding more than any toy should. I would definitely recommend it for the Star Wars fanatic in your house."
4,Pretty good,"I like this game, but it can be frutrating at times. I can't beat Obi-Wan, so I am stuck and can't move on. The graphics are about as good as N64, but you aren't looking at graphics when oyu are trying to slash Darth Maul. It takes practice, but is worth it. The price is a little too expensive for what you are getting.I have a GC, but this game got me off the couch. I gave it 3 educational stars because it helps improve hand-eye coordination. Overall, a good buy."
3,Light Saber Fun,This is a fun toy but a little bit hard to get used to/calibrating the saber etc. It is definately for older kids- maybe 7-8 ish(which is what they rec.). I got it for my 5 year old and he's done well but it requires some reading. My husband really liked it. Easy to set up (plug/install batteries)
1,Disappointing,"I bought this for my boys (ages 10,8 and 5) who are HUGE Star Wars fans...very disappointed. This game is nearly impossible for my ten year old...I even had a hard time mastering the moves. Too frustrating for kids AND adults, thus it sits in the game drawer untouched. Save your money."
2,Doesn't work very well.,"I bought this as a gift for my son. He is a Star Wars fanatic. But it was not really worth the buy. The ""eye"" does not pick up very well. He would be playing and his ""saber"" wouldn't work. I moved the ""eye"" every which way, but was unable to get it to constantly pick up my son's movement. If it wasn't for that, this would be a fun toy."
3,A very good toy.,This is a very good toy.You can spend hours playing with it.I like that the light saber does not take batteries.Now for the pros and cons.Pros.1.Lightsaber does not need batteries.2.Realistic feal.3.Lightsaber is accurate.4.Easy to hook up to the tv.5.Challenging.Cons.1.Levels are too long.2.You cannot pause the game.3.You have to stand perfectly in front of the censor.Overall.Its a great toy.Thanks Grams and Papa for buying this toy for me.:)
5,"GREAT GAME for Grown up StarWars Geeks, Too.","I got it for free with the SW Trivial Pursuit purchase, and am amazed that i love it more than that game!It is very exciting, fun, responsive, and entertaining.I am somewhat of a game console addict lately, but have been hooked on this game for a week now."
2,"Preachy, blah!","3 Good songs, Overstand, Building, Outlives the Man. Singer has a good voice, but the album never really goes beyond that. Too Bad!"
4,First Book,This is the first attempt at writing for d'Hage and it becomes evident in the way the script is handled (very Australian) but the amazing part is the depth of information that the book contains. He has conducted an enormous amount of research on his subjects and I have no doubt that as his writing style matures he will certainly be in the bestseller category.
1,Boring copy of Angels and Demons,The author of this book can't hide his hatred toward the Church. The plot seems to be similar to the Angels and Demons but the author doesn't hold any punches. One may wonder what stopped him from accusing John Paul II of killing his predecessor JPI? I can't judge the book because I could not finish it. There is no plot in it that I could find.
1,Low quality story,"The story in this book is just plain stupid. The bears wake up hungry, so the hungry bears go to the river to *play* with fish. ""The fish had fun"", then ""All of the bears had so much fun, they forgot they were hungry."" Apparently it is not politically correct for bears to eat fish. In the sequel, is it politically correct for bears to die of starvation?Also, the pictures are very repetitive, particularly the bears' faces. Early readers deserve better."
1,just bad,"We've read some stupid early readers, but I think this is the worst. The story is so bad it's actually hard for a kid to follow. The illustrations are ghastly and incomprehensible. The flying fish and the toothless, handless bears cavort in the water ecstatically on every page. How do these things get published? Surely there should be some competition in children's publishing, yet there is so much dreck."
5,"An History, Mostly Perfect","Bobby Gilmer's Book perfectly fit my needs for researching my historical novel-in-progress which is based on a couple living in the ""Old Iron District"" in the early Nineteenth Century. Mr. Gilmer has many other books which aren't available on Amazon, but which may be found in select book stores in Upstate SC, or in major city's public library research areas."
1,Very disappointed,"I've always associated McGuire Nicholas with quality products, so I was disappointed when after about 3 weeks of use, the stitching began to unravel at the nail/tool pockets. Now the part where the belt goes through the apron is tearing. My first McGuire Nicholas apron lasted about 20 years of work as a professional. This one won't last beyond 20 weeks, even though I have glued it together the best I can."
5,Great Collection of years worth of songs,"I LOVED this album. I prefer acoustic music (though this band rocks too) so I was very happy to come across this album of songs from over the years - old ones that I loved and more that were new to me. The dialogue included from the live shows is fun and sweet, and really fills in the gaps of what they've been up to for the many years since I've had the opportunity to see them perform. They are great song writers with notable skill on their instruments and their vocals are so beautiful together!"
4,Tracklisting,1. Watching The Sun Come Up2. Sugarbomb3. Paid To Get Drunk4. Watching The Sun Come Up (video)
1,Contains Triclosan,"I bought this toothpaste and was shocked when I got home and read the ingredient list. The active ingredient is triclosan. Triclosan is currently being investigated by the FDA. It is also under review by the EPA who is considereing banning it. It is already banned in Europe and Canada. In short, it's an endocrine system disruptor. It alters hormone regulation. It also contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Not only is it bad for people, but you spit it down the sink and it gets into the water supply and harms the ecosystem. Google it. This is not stuff you want to put in your mouth.Most toothpastes don't have triclosan, but this one does."
3,common toothpaste,"this product is cheap, usually you can get it free in CVS. It is not very effective, do not expect too much."
5,Wife Loves This,So glad I was able to find another one on Amazon. My wife loves this wooden spoon and she looked everywhere for another one. It feels really solid in your hand and has held up to heavy use over the last 2 years. Thinking about buying several of these to have on hand as house warming gifts.
2,Calphalon Wood All Purpose Turner,"Beware. This Calphalon Wood All Purpose Turner is advertised as being 3 1/2 inches wide. In reality, is is about 2 5/8 inches wide."
5,My wife likes this wooden spoon,It's a heavy duty spoon and well worth the money. I got it for her as a surprise gift.This brand seems to be of much higher quality than the discount store brands. The wood is a much better grade of wood and they are very thick and do not break or chip like the others do. I will not say that they are impossible to break but I will say that it will take a lot of force to get one to break.
2,great features but,i basicly agree with the previous review but mine had major problem static noise whenever i tried to record from my dvd shame picture looked good to bad sound did not match i sent mine back. be aware
5,Fabulous book,"I just rediscovered this book after searching for it for over a year.As a child this book meant so much to me. I still cry when I read it. It helps children to see that animals have emotions and feelings and helps them to identify with the suffering of animals, a lesson they will hopefully hold on to forever."
3,Readable,"This is not a Superman story, that's for sure. The dark settings of Gotham City, the storyline, the background, all point to a Batman flick.Nevertheless, the plot is interesting, to say the least. The idea of Lois Lane narrating the story is a good one, and well exploited. However, the attempt to merge the personalities of Lex Luthor and the Joker falls flat on its face....it is just a no-go, considering how different the two personalities are in any case.The book is sporadically good, but has the potential to be much better. It fails to tackle the problems Bruce Wayne (aka Superman, in this case) would have experienced as a child, in terms of his superpowers.I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out and buy this comic book, but it is definitely worth one read. And it does set the mind thinking about 'what-if' things had been as portrayed by this book."
1,Good up to a point.,"I have to agree with the reader who wanted to slam this book into a wall. Damn PC endings. Batman is one of the more primal forces in the DC Universe, an unstoppable engine for justice. Given access to Kryptonian powers? Makes for pretty chilling stuff. But vital stuff too. This story isn't Superman's, despite his name on the cover. The first half of the book is one of the most intriguing set ups I've seen, and then they totally fumble the ball with this Lois Lane as Luke Skywalker and Batman as Vader. In a sensible story, Batman would have toned down his senseless beatings, relied more on the psychology of fear as he does in the ""normal"" Gotham City. What's more terrifying: a Batman that can juggle tanks or one who can see and hear everything in Gotham? Yeah, so this book is only for those with rose-colored glasses. For the rest, avoid. The let down is so evident, you'll be beside yourself with fury."
2,Disappointingly sketchy,"Steve Kress is a great ornithologist and I greatly admire the work he's done in wildlife species and habitat preservation--but this book is not one of his best achievements. Basic and sketchy, at best it might give you a few ideas, but you won't be able to really implement them from this book--you'll have to get much better and more complete references. Look on the audabon web site or other birdwatchers web sites for ideas, and donate the money you save from not buying this book to audabon."
1,Very dull!,"I bought this book based on all the reviews describing it as ""laugh out loud"" but gave up on it after about 100 pages. I found it repetitive and boring. Mr James can be very amusing, but in this biography he appeared to be obsessed with sex and masturbation. After a while it became very dull. If you are looking for a funny childhood memoir, read ""The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid"" by Bill Bryson."
3,Rest tonight,Relaxing and restful sleep without strong drugs or a presciption.CAUTION: some persons with allergies to Valum( man made drug) will experiance similar reactions to Valerian Root.
2,Vitamins,"When I bought this product, I thought I'd like it. It had the worst taste I've ever tried. While service and receipt from the company was excellent, the product itself wasn't so great."
2,HORRIBLE taste,I tried everything to hide the taste and it is awful. I had to throw away the bottle it was so bad.
3,"Great premise, but lacked follow through","The premise was great - the bride marries the wrong man! The rest of the book is attempts to untangle this mess. I was captivated in the first few chapters, but then became frustrated with the increasingly outlandish reasons/ways the heroine is prevented from finding out the truth behind her marriage to Harry. The actual blooming of Gwen and Harry's relationship gets sort of lost between the twists and turns necessary to keep Gwen in the dark. Gwen does seem very naive about all of it. The chemistry between the hero and heroine is good, but it takes too long for it to um, come to fruition. One can't help but feel that if Harry had taken 5 minutes to have a little chat with Gwen right after wedding, things could have resolved themselves happily much, much sooner. In essence, sort of a silly frustrating read."
2,Only during a Blizzard!,"I honestly tried to give the book a chance but even I cannot be that generous. I was so intrigued by the plot description only to be let down by the actually product. Besides the fact that all the major characters in the book treating the heroine like a complete twit, there was also the problem of the actually writing style. The book simply did not flow well!!"
4,Funny and romantic.,I read this book in 3 hours I'couldn't put it down. I recomend it for a weekend reading.
1,I couldn't even finish it,"This book has a dopey, teenage heroine who is probably more like what society girls were really like in the Regency Period than Amanda Quick or Celeste Bradley's heroines. However, since I am a 21st century woman, I had a really hard time relating to this flighty twit. I gave up on this book and turned it in to the used bookstore with no regrets."
3,Slick but disappointing,"This book disappointed: the plot, while full of twists and complications, was unconvincing, and the characterization was inconsistent. I enjoy Regencies that are full of fun, but I expect more than this book provided."
2,disjointed and short on romance,"Started off well with the twin switch, then spent way too many pages explaining why. The heroine starts off biddable and ends a tyrant. Really no development of a relationship between the two leads just boom they are in love. Disappointing."
4,Mom's Attack,The book is just like the epsiodes on tv but you in the book you can actually read what she is thinking. Also you can picture it different in your mind than what you see on the tv epsiode.I would recomend this book for all Lizze Mcguire FansKim SmoothFrom Ohio
1,"Junk, complete junk","While its a nice, simple, clean looking toaster, which is why I wanted it -- its flimsy beyond belief.In less than a week it was broken. A weld inside broke.Amazon's return policy is great -- no quibbles there -- but this thing isn't worth it."
3,Works Pretty Good,"This toaster works well, but it's pretty standard. The slots are large to accommodate bagels, but sometimes smaller items (like thin slices of bread, toaster strudles, pop-tarts) fall into the cracks which requires unplugging the toaster and fishing around with a fork or knife to dislodge & retrieve the long lost food item...so that's a hassle. The stainless steel body probably looks cooler in the picture than it will in your kitchen cause it's harder to keep clean than a toaster with a smooth plastic shell. Next time around I'll probably purchase a more expensive toaster with more bells and whistles, but the Farberware FPT200 2-Slice works well for the price."
1,Not for me,"It's possible that ski instructors could get something out of this video, but I was dissapointed. As I watched I was trying to understand what Kent was doing hoping that the dialogue would clarify what was happening. The explanations were not very helpful. I've seen other videos which were far more effective and more fun. Try Lito Tejada-Flores or Martin Heckelman's ski tips. I would have liked something more from this or even just a little something. Well you win some you lose some."
2,The VM Flasher,"When my parents told me that they'd bought me a cell phone, I was so excited. However, when I got the package, and looked at the phone, a Tracfone Nokia 1221, I was sorely dissapointed.After that, I was desperate for a new phone. What's more, I wanted one with a camera. This one seemed to fit the bill, so I rushed out and bought it. BIG MISTAKE.I hate this phone now. First off, the camera sucks. I also hate the faceplate, external antenna, and green backlight. Ugh. Not to mention the carrier name. Its a bit embarassing when someone asks you who your phone carrier is and you have to answer, 'Virgin Mobile'. Really, what kind of name is that?I only wish I had kept the original packaging. Then I could've returned this, a(...). Oh well. I'm going to get a new phone. And a good lesson learned, do your homework before you buy."
4,cool phone,This phone is so cool. the camera is all so cool.my mom siad I sould waste all my airtime money on games and ringtones but I buy them anyways. If you want a cool phone buy this one
4,great phone and great service,"i got my v7 for over a month now and i'm having a lot of fun with it. i bought the data cable and changed the faceplate, they make it even better. (...) good deal!!! don't miss it. u can also enjoy the fun that i'm having"
2,Not a very good phone,"Well, after having the phone a good month or so, I have found good and bad things about it.Good*Beautiful color display*Easy to use key layout*Downloadable wallpaper, games, and ringtonesBad*Camera photos are blurry and VERY poor quality; must be in bright light in order to get a decent picture, and even then it still looks crappy. You cannot take night pictures at all.*Ugly blue faceplate*Annoying external antenna*Cheap looking green backlight*External display is impossible to read in low lightIn all, this is a pretty okay phone, however its not the phone for me, and I will be looking elsewhere for a phone."
3,its ok,"this phone has its pros and cons. i think that it is a great starter phone and virgin mobile is the best prepaid service but there are some downsides. First, it has a really crappy camera and i mean awful. also, it does not hold that much memory."
3,Audiovox Flasher,"First I have to say I bought this phone mostly for the camera. Bad desicion. But still, there are good and bad things about this phone.The Good*Full-color display screen*Downloads wallpaper, games, and ringtones with the easy to use VirginXL*Ringtones are loud enough to hear when set on the highest volume*Has cool built in extras; calendar, alarm clock, world clock, etc.The Bad*Camera photos are poor quality*External antenna which can break off*External display screen is nearly impossible to read in low lightI think I will keep my flasher a few more months, then Im going to get a new phone, AND a real digital camera."
2,What is up with the service?,"I have this phone and I have more problems with it than I have good things to say about it. It doesn't ring loud enough, I don't have service where I live, and I'm a teen, so I would like to be able to call my friends, and it drops my calls when I do have service. The prepaid plans are a mess, they charge you $0.25 per minute for the first 10 minutes a day, or else you can choose to pay them $0.35 a day so you can talk for $0.10 a minute, but that sucks when I can't call anyone anyway, so I'm paying them $0.35 a day to just hold the cell phone. But when I have it to $0.25 for the first ten minutres, I use up all my money for one phone call. So i suggest you go get a REAL cell phone and don't get tangled up in this Virgin Mobile crap."
3,Decent phone,"Alright, to break this phone down, lets start with the pros.Buttons - easy to navigate with, only thing wrong is the button backlight would be better blue instead of greenscreen - easy to readlooks - good look, i have the navy blue one and it turns headscamera - pretty good, just dont zoom in too muchAight now the cons(and there is just one)the ringer - you wont be able to hear this thing ring unless your in a room by yourself with no other sound. it is the lowest thing i have ever heard (or not heard). this phone would be the best one for VM but they continue the dreaded non-ringing phone as they did with the 8610.so unless you just want this phone to take pics with, i suggest you get sumthing different"
4,Audiovox 8910 Flasher V7 Blue Prepaid Phone (Virgin Mobile),"I have only two problems with this phone. First, the front display on this phone is not bright enough to be able to read it in order to see who is calling or the time and date. Second, the ring tones are not nearly long enough or loud enough even on the longest and loudest settings. You really have to have the phone on top of you in order to hear it. You can't hear it if it is in your purse or even in your pocket and by the time you do hear it (if you do)it hangs up before you can answer it. Even when you do hear it, you have to answer it quickly or you will miss it. Other than that, the normal usage of the phone is great."
1,Not a bad phone if you can hear it ring,Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect. The vibrating funtion is equally underpowered and virtually useless. If you need to be able to hear your phone ring in any place louder than a church look elsewhere. Do a quick check on the net and you will find this problem well documented by hundres of other users.
1,I Can't use it yet !!!,"I bought this phone in the swapmeet by 50 dll , it is not open ,but the bad thing is that I can't use it because Virgin Mobil needs to activate this with a proof of purchase receipt which I don't have because in the swapmeet you pay cash !!$$$ Now , I don't know what to do because the person who sold it to me , is not working there anymore ,,,plsss somebody could help me ???/"
2,This phone sucks A**,"man this phone SUCKS.... god man i first got the phone and i took it back to my house and turned it on and it didnt have any service. So i'm like ""yeah, okay, mabye cause its new, but after i had it for about 2 weeks i sold it and switched over to t-mobile to go and they are great. but the phone itself had pretty cool features to it like i like how you could take pictures from the outside. and by the way (compare the airtime rates from t-mobile and virgin and t-mobile is cheaper and gives you more minutes"
3,Virgin Mobile Veteran,"I have owned almost every VM series phone and I must say that this is a good phone. The camera works really well. The only problem I see is with the ringtones. It has really really crappy sound for the real music ringtones, so I just stick to polys. I still recommend it however."
5,Best VM offers,"This is an all around great phone. Definatly worth getting over the vox 8610. (I've had both). The camera takes suprisingly good pictures for a cell phone. Its also pretty cool how the outer display can act as a ""mirror"" for taking self photos. It has good features and is very customizable."
3,kind of small but fun,"these are smaller than i expected them to be and one of them doesn't respond as well as the other. they are fun to crash into each other. the boys like it when they ""come apart"". it was a pretty good value for the money but we're only a month past xmas and they don't play with them anymore and are already asking for new remote cars."
1,Ruined my day :(,"I put this in my hair, to make it shine as the product name says, but all it did was make my hair look and feel very greasy. My hair was heavy the whole day. I was not happy. Also, the product is advertised as unisex, but it has a very male scent. It doesn't smell good at all. All in all, I wish I hadn't bought it. You should save you money."
1,"Good History, Good Story!","Since I am history buff, I enjoyed this book hugely because it is clearly well researched. It got the period right and it tells a heck of a good tale. I couldn't put it down."
3,Starter Kit,The kit provides organization for the Nintendo. It is especially helpful for young people to keep their game and programs safe. Thank you for recommending the starter kit to accompany the DS Nintendo.
4,DS Kit,Great! I purchased as a gift for my bro in law for christmas & it is exactly what he needed/wanted!
4,Video Game accessory kit,Nice. But there are other colors and other types of kits. certainly meets functional purpose. I recommend this kit.
3,DS Lite Starter Kit,"The packaging was beat up, but everything inside was in pristine condition. It was shipped promptly and arrived within the minimum time frame of three days. I was very pleased overall with this product and the seller."
4,the case and charger is worth it,"They all work very well, after a couple of months I am still using mine and my DS is very well protected in the case."
4,Perfectly functinal DS case,"The DS case holds both my DS and the spare styluses. The game case doesn't fit inside the DS case, but I like the design, and it helps me keep track of my games. Haven't had a chance to use the car charger yet."
4,Just What I Needed!,This is just what I needed for my new Nintendo DS Lite! The extra stylus will come in handy and now I don't have to worry about storage or charging when we travel. Excellent purchase and I'm glad I got it.My boyfriends daughter got a DS for Christmas this year. I am going to order a starter kit for her!
5,Game of Life Affirmation Cards,Game of Life affirmation cards are amazing in their usefulness. They are such an inspiration and so easy to slip a card into my wallet and refer to through out the day! Way to go Amazon-- for offering such meaningful and inspirational products.
3,Hemp is king,"The History of the Hemp Industry in Kentucky is a well documented Phd. thesis about the title.I have read this book as research for a novel I have written. I found that the authors research was very helpful to me, and I was most impressed by his efforts. I have been able to use his information to enrich my historical novel.This work is most accurate and well documented, it will have a very special readership."
2,Essential Book,"For someone contemplating a move to Brasil, this book provides a great wealth ofinformation. I did learn a number of thing by reading the book."
5,Just what I was looking for,The raisers are perfect - I only needed to raise the bed a little bit and they were just the right size. I have wood floors and they do not scratch at all.
4,Just right bed risers,"After shopping for weeks for bed risers, I decided on these to raise a bed what turned out to be a very odd number of inches and less than most other risers. These turned out to be just right, being able to stack them in twos, to raise this bed the optimum amount necessary."
1,I hope these are returnable!,"I was really looking forward to gaining storage under my bed with these. Put them under the bed (have casters) with the box spring in the frame. As soon as I moved the mattress onto the box spring, all 4 corners of the bed ROLLED off the risers. Started over - same thing happened! I am SOOOOO disappointed! they got such great reviews but totally do not work for me!."
4,Bed Risers,The risers did what they were intended to do in a clear and efficient manner. If they continue to hold up I will be very pleased.
4,Buy 2 sets if you have a california king,"We wanted more storage space under the bed so tried out this product hoping that it would give us more clearance under the bed to fit plastic storage containers. 2 risers under each gave us the space we were looking for, but since we have a california king, we needed an extra set to put under to 2 middle wheels of the bed. So now we have a couple extra risers. I'd recommend using at least 2 per wheel to make at least some kind of difference.Gave it a 4 instead of a 5 rating - it would be nice if it was sold in a set of 12 for king size beds (and not having to buy 2 sets of 8 and be left with 4)"
5,Rise and shine,This makes getting out of bed a breeze. I have RA and sometimes it is hard to stand up. Not anymore thanks to these risers. It is easy to set up and has made all the difference in my mornings. Paula
4,Acid Reflux begone,I needed these at the head of my bed for acid reflux problems. I love the fact that they are clear so my carpet shows through. They've been great -- now I need to buy more storage for under the bed!
4,Just what I needed!,"I was looking for a riser that would give me a few inches, so i could put some storage boxes under the bed. These worked perfectly. It didn't make the bed so high that i had to have a stool to get in it and my bed ruffle didn't come up 4 inches off the floor like it did when i got the generic bed risers from Wal-Mart. I Love them!!!"
5,Just what I was looking for...,"I bought these bed risers for a nightstand so wasn't sure whether or not they would work. They worked out great! I love the clear color because they match everything. All in all, this was a great purchase."
5,How to treat your esophageal reflux,"Clear Bed Risers (Set of 8)If your doctor told you to elevate the head of your bed to minimize stomach acid coming up into your throat while you sleep, this is for you. My bed is particularly difficult because it has legs at the head and foot, plus middle legs. With these risers, I put four (for a four inch rise) under the head legs and two risers under the middle legs. Works great, and altho it's not the six inches prescribed, my husband can tolerate it. The clear plastic is less noticeable than some risers."
4,These are great,"I've looked at bed risers for years, but thought them too ugly & they were all too high. I was thrilled to find these, and am very happy with them. 2"" higher is perfect for my bed, and these are barely noticeable. The only disadvantage I've seen so far is that I can't move my bed at all when the risers are on, like for changing the sheets. But I'm very happy to have them."
2,Not As Advertised,"The written description for Raise Its states,""These bed leg risers are made of durable plastic with interlocking design for safe stacking and non-slip inserts to prevent sliding!"" I have twin beds that I wanted to raise 1"",so the package of 8 risers seemed ideal. However, the advertised non-slip inserts were included on only 4 or the risers, leaving 4 of the 8 bed legs free to slide around and scratch the floor to their heart's content. Nowhere in their advertising or on their packaging does the company say that only 4 risers have non-slip inserts, making the product suitable for only one bed. In fact, the box of risers clearly shows a photo of a riser (insert included) along with a bullet point stating that, ""Non-slip inserts prevent sliding on wood or tile.""I emailed the company asking them to send me the 4 inserts that had been left out. Within two weeks they complied without comment."
5,Add more space,"This is exactly what I wanted. I wanted to make space under the bed for roll out containers to store, scrabooking and sewing material. I like the ability to decide just how high I need to lift the bed to accommodate my storage units. The lifts have a space to hold the wheels on the bed to make them secure. The skid proof bases help them from moving around on the wood floor. There is nothing I don't like about them. Buy them. I can think of lots of other ways to use them, I bet you will too."
5,Brilliant product,"I needed to raise a bed frame exactly 1"" so a leather bedskirt I had purchasd would hang properly. These things are made to accomodate the rollers as well as the flat bottomed post in the middle of the frame. Plus, they snap together perfectly if you want to go higher. I highly recommend!"
2,I'm not sure why others like these?,"In my mind, these are cheap plastic, they do not protect my wood floors, and they are not as high as I thought (even stacked.) If you're planning on using them for two beds, the extra four stacking risers are not meant to be used alone."
3,"Okay, but only for limited uses","Basic, clear colored is good, and they are strong enough. If all one needs is to raise a bed higher on a level floor, they are fine.I'm looking for more because I'm in a region with much earth movement. All buildings are crooked with uneven floors, especially the old homes dominating the housing market. Because most of my furniture and appliances require leveling, I am continually searching for just right sizes and colors for various pieces. I wish these bed risers came in smaller sizes for other kinds of furniture legs. Also, I wish they came in shorter sizes for accurate leveling. As they are, they look good only on furniture with large legs or wheels, and for many of my pieces of furniture including beds, they are either too high, too low, or too high if I put two together. The search continues."
5,Great Product,Our new sofa needed a little lift & these risers do a great job. Very happy with this product and with quick delivery.
5,Best bed risers,"Ordered these bed risers after trying others from other stores. These have a non-slip grip on the bottom that keeps them from sliding around. Great for kids who like to jump on their beds. These may be a bit pricey, but they're the best I could find. The risers are clear which makes them almost ""invisible""."
4,Satisfied!,"Needed bed risers and did not like the ones you always see in the ""bed and bath"" store -- large and bulky looking and black!Thought the clear color would be good for under my bedskirt and they were. I doubled them up so 8 was perfect. However, if you only need 4 and 4 you will find that only 4 have the rubber pieces on the bottom - although with weight on them I do not think they will move. Price is right and I would recommend them."
2,"beautiful, but.....","the watch is a great looking watch.. however, it stopped working after a couple of weeks. Thinking it needed a new battery, I went to a jewelry store to have a new battery installed. The jeweler told me that the battery was fine, but the inner workings of the watch needed repair. The cost of repair would be almost as much as the watch. oh well."
4,"In the Words of the Bishop: ""The Real Deal""","What can you say about a group that has been going strong since the 1940's. This is Gospel the way it is meant to be heard. No electronic wizardry. There aren't too many groups that when they play, the live audience is so physically overwhelmed, there are waiting ambulances to tend to them. This is typical of the music you will hear on any given Sunday in a real down-home Southern Gospel Baptist Church, as also in New York where I am from. I also suggest listening to their Live album recorded in different venues in Europe. The Five Blind Boys of Mississippi was the inspiration for many of the modern day groups you hear today. I do not think you will be disappointed."
5,"Older video, not in HD but good content","Older video, not in HD but good contentNice techniques, and beautiful nude women.Particularly like the shower massage as the beautiful women presses her impressive breasts up against the glass wall.My wife and I have watched them multiple times, and enjoyed applying the techniques on each other.We always end up having hot sex as a result."
1,OUTDATED!,"Bought this book a few years back and was 'weeding' out my library. Decided to read over once again.The notes on pages I had made, the recipe suggestions to try (never were tried) caught my attention.So much has been updated on nutrition, substituion and real cooking.While not a bad book, it certainly is not totally with today's findings.We need to eat real food, in moderation, without chemicals, additives etc.So many recipes called for cottage cheese!!! How outdated is that!"
1,Doesn't deserve even one star.,"My doctor pulled me off of this diet after one month. I followed it faithfully. Even so, I had severe headaches and almost constant hunger. I craved the reward meals. Even though I have problems with insulin, this *life* diet didn't work for me! This book was a complete waste of my money!"
2,What? Just 1/4 of a Tomato?,"Yes, if you can follow this diet for life, it will certainly help you with your carb. cravings. Problem is, I grew up eating tomatoes, grow my own, love them. This diet tells me I can only eat 1/4 of a tomato with my reward meal. 1/4 of a tomato? 4-5 tomatoes is more like it for me. This is not a diet I can follow for the rest of my life. Another problem is that the only time I'm likely to eat ""regular"" carbs--potatoes, bread, etc.--is for breakfast and I just don't have time to make breakfast my reward meal, with veggies, etc. Guess this one just isn't for me. I've gone back to Suzanne Sommers. And, I agree with the reviewer that says their research is pretty flimsy. So is Suzanne Sommers' but at least her diet works better for me."
1,Don't be a simpleton!!!,"Eating highly fatty foods and cholesterol ladden foods are not good for you in the long run, even if you do lose weight. But you will be a good looking corpse!"
2,Great Idea,"I thought this book was a great idea but, my experience of it was that it is just toooooooooo hard.I'm the kind of person who does eat a lot of vegetables already but, I was sick of the sight of salad in no time.In the future I may try a variation of this diet as some of the ideas are good but, I very much doubt that I'll do it the way they tell us too here... just too too hard!!"
3,Liked it,I thought it was informative and highly useful. It was interesting to read. I feel healthier already and I haven't even done anything.
1,Not For Everyone,"I was eager to start the book however after being on the eating plan for 5 weeks I gained 1.5 pounds. The diet did take away cravings and the feeling of having to eat deminished. However, I do not think this diet is for everyone. I only wanted to lose 10 lbs and now have just made it worse. The diet appears to be only geared for individuals are at an obese level. So, it is not for everyone as the book states."
4,Lose Weight Without Suffering!,This is an excellent book as far as the program goes. I lost an average of 1 pound per day! (The book promises 1.5 per week) The program is EASY to follow because after 3 days on the diet you loose your desire for those fat/sugar filled foods that aren't good for you. I've recommended it to all my friends at work!
2,Consider the Schwarzbein Principle,"If you are looking for a sustainable, reasonable carbohydrate diet, consider reading the Schwarzbein Principle by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. The Carbohydrate Addict's plan is too contrived for me with the Reward Meals, lack of carbs at most meals and snacks, and the restrictions on certain vegetables that they claim cause cravings in some people. The Schwarzbein plan has you eating unrefined carbs and protein at each meal and snack, and is a more realistic approach to insulin and seratonin regulation."
4,I finally found the program for my problem but....,"I really feel that this book is the answer to my weight struggle. I feel that its advise is very sound. I tried the Atkins diet and it was way to extreme for me. I felt sick and gained weight. I have struggled with this since I was 18. Now I am 28 and have a son and twin daughters it is even worse. I have about 30lbs to loose and am excited to be on this program. I started about a week ago. I do struggle with the variety. The book offers a lot of recipes but they seem to gourmet to me and my family. My six year old and four year olds are not even interested in them not to mention the time to cook most of them. If anyone has any recommendations for a recipe book or a place to get ideas, let me know."
1,Can I Give This Book A Lower Rating?,"I watched these diet ""experts"" on ""Oprah""as they filled the audience members who ""have triedEVERYTHING"" with more false hope that all diet books and socalled ""experts"" fill their victims heads with. Exercise and sensible eating with NO animal products will keep your weight down AND your cholesterol down. This diet eliminates or limits too many healthy foods and allows too many artery clogging ones. C'mon America! When are we going to learn that the answer is simple?--NO animal products! They are the only cholesterol producing foods. I can't help but wonder...Did the beef industry invent this ""diet?"""
1,Very disappointing,"From reading the excerpts, this book seemed written ""just for me"". What I found instead was sloppy reassurances about how nothing was my fault and how easy it would be if I follow the plan. It was simply too patronizing for my tastes."
5,This is it!,"I'm telling you, this works! I am the word for word definition of a carb addict...and if you follow this PROPERLY, it does work. But what is more important, is that you don't feel hungry, and after just a VERY SHORT time, the cravings I had all day for carbs went away. (I'm talking 2 days or less.) Don't get me wrong, I look forward to my reward meal dessert. But virtually no cravings. I am very happy to have found this book & without hesitation, recommend it to anyone."
3,slow loser,"I have ben on this program now 6 weeks. I have only lost 6 pounds.Of course I struggled over the holidays and got right back on it. I am sensitive to Msg and follow the book to the letter. I drink the 2 liters of water everyday. I have read the other reviews and am so disscouraged. This is going so slow for me.I need more salad dressing recepies to make myself because I don't care for the bottled ones.Someone please give me some advice and encouragement. I only want to lose about 12 kilo's and at this rate it will take to long.I don't understand why it is not going faster like the other reviews. I feel great, and have energy and no more cravings just like the book said. Please off me some advice here!"
5,The Last Diet you will ever need !,"I began my low-carb 'journey' at the end of January, 2000. As of May, I am down almost 50 pounds and loving this diet...if that's what you want to call it! If you're unsure if this diet is for real, I challenge ANYONE to faithfully follow it for 30 days. If after that time you haven't lost weight, feel wonderful and energetic, sleep better and feel in complete control, then shame on me for recommending this. I can tell you that for me, my blood pressure is down, my cholestrol is down, chronic edema has all but disappeared and I don't tire like I used to. Last year for our vacation, we toured some theme parks. I was so racked with leg pain that I had to rent a handicap cart just to get around. This month, I went back to the same park and I was able to walk the entire day and was ready to continue to walk when I got home! Tired? No way! I think it will work for anyone that truly wants to lose their weight and be healthy. Good Luck!"
5,My Weight and Credit Problems Were Also Related,"The Hellers have done a great job showing me and Rosie O'Donnell how to control our cravings for carbohydrates. However, I had another ""addiction"" not to food but to credit cards. While I was able to stop putting on new weight thanks to the Hellers, whenever I was happy, or sad or mad I'd buy things that I couldn't afford and didn't even want.""SIMPLE MONEY SOLUTIONS: 10 WAYS YOU CAN STOP FEELING OVERWHELMED BY MONEY AND START MAKING IT WORK FOR YOU,"" by Nancy Lloyd also helped me to put an end to my yo-yo money diets. I'm finally making good progress in paying off my credit card debt and I'm LOSING WEIGHT. Both books changed my life and could change yours too. Rosie should start a ""debt free"" club because I'm not her only fan who has both weight and debt problems! Many other single moms also share these two problems."
2,Did it- gained it back,I read the book when it first came out and lost some weight. This is not a diet I can live on. I gained the weight back. Maybe it works for some. I've had much better success exercising more and changing the way I think. Two books I read recently really changed the way I felt about myself and helped me to lose more weight than any diet I've ever been on. Man's Search for Meaning was one of the best books I've ever read. It teaches you what is important in life. It is an account of a survivor of the Holocaust. The other book is the Mass Market Woman. That book made me think about why I've spent most of my life on diets without success and why women put so much hope that looking better will make them happier and why this is false.
3,This diet is restricting,"The authors are correct in that the diet cuts down on hunger. I found the diet to be restricting. I can't see staying on this program very long if all you can have for breakfast is eggs, protein, and limited vegetables. Boring! Don't get excited about the reward meal."
3,Good program recommendation ... but painfully simple.,"This book outlines the causes and treatment of obesity resulting from carbohydrate induced over-production of insulin. The recommended program seems to be effective (in my case) and easy to follow. Unfortunately, the book is targetted for a very low reading level, uses lots of repetition, and minimal scientific explantion. This makes it almost painful to read. The book also provides an extensive meal planning section and recipies.If you can live with the simplistic explanations, then this book will provide useful advice."
5,This is wonderful!,"I have been following this program since 11/1/99 and I have lost 4 lbs so far. This is such a freeing plan because I can eat what I want to for dinner. Therefore there is no cheating and no disappointments/failures. I recommend this to anyone.Also, I would like to hear from the person from Palm Harbor, FL who posted about a week ago. We could be local CAD buddies."
2,Much harder to follow and understand than promotions suggest,I was very disappointed in this book. I listened to many promotions and the diet sounded simple and promising. I had hoped to find an eating plan for life. I had a hard time following this book and found the restrictions (other than the reward meal which were more like a binge) were to intense.
1,I've never read the book just had a few questions.,Can someone please e-mail me and let me know whether or not this is just an updated version from the previous book--The carbohydrate addicts diet? I don't want to get both books if not needed. Thanks
1,horrible,"I lost 10 pounds, and then they came back with reinforcements. don't get excited about the ""reward meals"", either."
2,Took too long to get tol the point,I waited for the book to get to the bottom line but it never really did. All it offered were some very detailed complication sample menus to follow for each meal.
1,This diet makes you sick,I went on this diet for 9 weeks and it turned me into a mess. I was constantly dizzy and low on energy and my mouth was very dry. I also found the diet was vey restrictive and bland.I'm surprised Oprah just recommended it to everyone before even trying it out for at least six months- I think she's taking a lot of people down the wrong path to weightloss- and it will backfire on her when people get sick!
1,"If you want to stay healthy, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DIET!!","I fail to see the reasoning behind this diet. Eat all the bacon and eggs and other high fat foods you want just as long as you don't consume any carbohydrates?! How much sense does that make?! Carbs are our source of energy and they should be eaten at each meal in small portions. They should also be low-fat. As soon as you dieters start eating carbs again, you will gain the weight right back. Anytime you deprive your body of an element it needs, of course you will loose weight, your body has no choice. If you want to stay healthy, STAY AWAY FROM THIS DIET, or better yet, ask your doctor."
5,An answer at last,"I have been heavy all of my life and six months ago I had a full hystorectomy. This book has been a life saver for me. I have been depressed, tired all the time and starving. It is interesting to me how carbohydrates and insulin affect hormone levels. I have read many articles about increasing seritonins that seem to coinside. I've even went off of my antidepressants. I have lost 10 pounds, have more energy, no depression and no cravings. People who comment that this diet has too much protein exaggerate. I think that the most important thing that this diet does is eliminate cravings. Thereby making it possible to cut back on all foods. It's so easy and seems so natural. I will do this the rest of my life."
5,Excellent resource for carbohydrate addicts!,"The Heller's have done a huge amount of research in putting out this book. This includes the ""real-life"" results of those of us who use this way of life and swear by it. Since beginning this program in May of 1999, I have lost almost 45 lbs, have tripled my exercise tolerance, have halved my cholesterol and triglyceride levels and feel the best I've felt in years! I truly recommend this book for those who have a carbohydrate addiction and want to learn how to control it."
5,This book has added years to my life and life to my years,"Within two weeks of following this plan my blood pressure dropped from 170/108 to 120/80. I began to sleep better and woke up refreshed. My stamina, energy levels and mental acuity all improved dramatically. The mild siezures that I have had since adolescence greatly decreased in number. From being at a point of desperation and wondering why there was no help for me I have gone to a more hopeful and healthy life in every way. On top of all that I am free from the horrible food cravings that I have always lived with. Sometimes I forget to eat. This book is a miracle for people like me."
5,this book has worked magic for me - wonderful,"This book is the only way of eating that has ever helped me to lose weight. I have been doing it for several months and have lost 1 1/2 pounds a week. Better than that, I feel great. It's sorted out lots of other minor problems of lethargy and depression that I thought I just had to learn to live with. I have real, day-long energy for the first time since puberty! Also, I am developing better muscle tone, so I'm sure I'm losing fat, not muscle. It might not work for everyone, but if you take the test and you test as a carbohydrate addict, then it will work for you. I know I will be eating like this for the rest of my life; I feel as if the Hellers have given me my life back."
4,"A good plan, but needs easier and more varied recipes.","The Hellers have written an updated version of their earlier work, The Carboyhdrate Addict's Diet. This book has newer findings about which vegetables are craving-reducing, as well as a modified daily eating plan. It continues their argument that for many people, carbohydrates trigger an addictive response that leads to weight gain and insulin resistance. The arguments they make are compelling as well as well-documented. The only thing they lack is epidemiological studies to back up their contentions.The main complaint I have with this book is the recipes. They are limited, especially the breakfast choices, and often are bland and rely on salt and pepper as the main seasoning ingredients. Perhaps they could work with a nutritionist and a chef to develop a companion book that is devoted to recipes and menu plans. I find that many of the recipes are time-consuming. There needs to be a list of quick snacks and shortcuts for the busy working family."
3,Nothing new under the sun.,"The basic facts of how starchy carbohydrates affect blood sugar levels are quite correct. However, jumping from that to calling it an ""addiction"" is faddish and not scientific. ANYONE who eats a lot of starchy carbs will have insulin pouring into their system. And that will leave you sluggish and hungry. But that cycle does not qualify as an addiction. People simply need to stop eating so much starchy foods and eat vegetables with a better glycemic index, along with protein in their meals and snacks. Body builders have known this for years. I have heard Arnold S. mention this many times on television over the years. I think body builders know a lot more about eating clean and healthy than do doctors or most of these certification companies or this author. Please, state the facts about food chemistry without adding the smoke and mirrors."
2,Carbohydrates needed but in the right proportions,"The ""Zone Diet"" has been the best tool for me in controlling the amount of carbohydrates I eat. It has been proven that you need a balanced amount of protein, fat and yes, even carbohydrates at every meal and snack to control the carbohydrate craving. Check out the ""Zone's"" web site at eicotech.com. I recommend the book ""Mastering the Zone"" which has great meal plans and really explains how we all have been eating wrong for so many years."
2,Jury is still out for me...I still feel deprived!,"I am in day 3 of this ""diet"". There definately things I appreaciate like the reward meal and the time limit because I think I would eat for hours if I had the chance and this makes me think about that.However, I just feel it is too strict. I am sitting here about 4 hours from my reward meal and I am already hungry, that salad and broiled chicken from lunch one hour ago was not enough.I keep thinking there has got to be some way to eat low carboyhydrate meal and lose weight. I keep wondering if this is really healthy. I am sick of eggs on day 3...I am trying to stay on this for 2 months and give it a chance. I wonder if I can make it one month.I think I will love weight but I will starve myself doing it...If this changes I will update this review later."
2,Not very useful,"I've read two books so far (Dr.Atkins and Protein Power) and this is the least useful of the three. I felt that even though Dr.Atkins was too restrictive, at least you learned the whys and hows of the diet..receipes galore in this one, but that's the majority of the book"
2,The path of Imbalance,"When insulin levels remain high for a long period of time and cause water retention, high blood pressure and weight gain results. Then a person's cells do not repond to insulin in a normal way so blood sugar may remain elevated or suddenly drop and result in hypoglycemia. The body yoyos up and down in energy, concentraion and mental acuity. The real problem is creating balance and health not just stopping sweet cravings. This book offers no answer at all for serious ill-health and depression resulting from carbohydrates. Health comes from strong digestion. Strong digestion is the basis of physical and mental balance. For that I take Xiao Yao Wan, digestive Chinese herb pills described in Hadady's ASIAN HEALTH SECRETS and PERSONAL RENEWAL."
5,Outstanding--the only cure I've ever found for my overeating,"Unbelievable how my entire life has been mis-spent trying to decipher all the different diet plans. Eat this, don't eat that, low-fat, etc., etc., etc. This book is amazing--it teaches you that you CAN eat it all--and still lose weight--and LOSE the cravings FOREVER!!! Being a complete chocoholic my entire life had led to an 18 lb. gain after years of struggling with the same 5-10 lbs. I was completely miserable. After a few months on the plan, I learned that I can have my cake and eat it too--and I'm back into a very comfortable size 8, my moods and my energy level are completely better, and this is a plan I can live with FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE!! Can't thank the Drs. Heller enough!!!!!"
4,I changed my way of eating,"I found the book I needed to reach my goal in weight. It was right to the point and it explained what I needed to know. It gave me a decision and it did not tell me what to do, the fact is it made me choose what I want. It said it was all up to me and how I wanted to feel and look. I love the comments from other people, I felt they was sincere in their feelings about the program. thank you for your help in reaching a goal... God Bless"
1,this diet is very difficult to follow,"When I read the opening paragraph, the Hellers' words spoke to me. I realized that I was a carbo addict. The problem is that this diet did not help to cure my addiction! I was miserable on this diet and ended up gaining -- rather than losing -- weight. Not recommended."
2,Things have changed,"I have the Dr's. first book they wrote about being a carbohydrate addict. I wanted desperately to follow the book and start loosing weight. I took the test to find out if I was a carbohydrate addict and I was a fit on all of the questions. But it was hard to follow, just like Adkins--and I wasn't loosing any weight. Now in this newer book, they have changed a few things around. I have not even been able to read through the whole book--too much garbage and not enough of getting down to what you should be doing to loose weight."
3,I Wish It Worked!,"I've been on the eating plan for 6 weeks now and the good news is, the cravings are gone! It's also one of the easiest ""diets"" I've tried. But I haven't lost a pound! I have around 30lbs to lose, and had some success with the Suzanne Somers diet. So far on the Carbohydrate Addict's Lifespan Plan, I've actually GAINED around 2lbs :-(I'm not giving up yet... the lack of cravings is unbelievable! But a diet that causes weight gain? Yikes..."
2,The Carbohydrate Addicts Lifespan Program,"This book is correct in its assessment of what causes our food cravings. The problem is that the book is written for and by the Department of Redundancy Department. The authors could have made the point that you have your 1 reward meal a day (consisting of 1/3 carbohydrates, 1/3 craving reducing vegetables and 1/3 craving reducing proteins), and 2 meals that are carbohydrate free. This only needs to be stated once or twice. They continued to belabor the point that high carbohydrate diets will result in the body's converting the sugars into fats, which causes heart disease and adult onset diabetes. This could have been summarized in a newspaper article. They also focus too much on the diet without discussing the merits of exercise. This will turn someone from being fat and flabby to being skinny and flabby."
4,A Real Eye Opener,The book was elightening and encouraging. The eating guidlines appear to be do able. I did not realize food combinations were so criticle to my overall health and how that in itself can cause weight loss.
4,Good product,"This is a little pricey. But, the quality is great. It is very versatile with long wires. I recommend this to anyone."
4,"Scholarly work, in need of Vol II","Dr. Vidyarthi must have done ages of research and hard work to have written this part of the book. Basically dealing with divine revelations about the coming of a Prophet in earlier scriptures, this book only deals with Bible and the Torah. Second Volume is desperately needed which should deal with Vedas and Puranas of Hinduism. His original work in Urdu has dealt with it.All in all, a good read, which might be warded away as wishful interpretation by Dr. Vidyarthi, by those who have no sound arguments to discredit or disprove his interpretations."
2,:(,"It does the job for the price but it leaves white streaks if u dont put it on right. its not heavy which is good, but the amount you put in is a lot just for it to work."
2,Great Service-wrong product,"The seller did great with the delivery of the item however... I didn't check to make sure I was getting the same product that I was trying to replace. So it was not the seller's fault, but my own. I was looking for a more firm creme pomade product and what I got was more the consistency of hand cream which with my hair would never work. I'd order from them again though because they were quick to ship."
1,no main event,great series until the rashad evans fight and the diego sanchez fight. crashes my system everytime i try to play them.
3,Asatru beliefs basics,"Bellows book is a good translation of the Poetic Edda, but it can be a difficult read. My personal favorite is the Carolyne Larrington version which I found to be easier to read and more easily understandable."
4,THINK POSITIVE!,"I found this book to have many practical ideas which I can repeat in my workplace. The book encourages us to be positive about our work...even if it is a four-letter word. It's an easy to read guide. I'm busy, so it's nice to have something quick and easy to refer to."
3,301 Ways to Have Fun a Work,"It has some good suggestions that I have put to use, but expected all suggestions to fit into most work environments."
5,WHAT A GENIUS,"This book is absolute genius.The author,Dave Hemsath has put together a masterpiece.I can only hope he is busy writing another book.Keep up the GREAT WORK."
2,301 Ways to Have Fun at Work,Simple ideas. Was not very useful for my work environment.I was looking for something that was a little different or unusual that we haven't tried.
1,Puh-leez!,This book is such a fraud - as if these greedy American corporations were going to do anything special to encourage their employees to have fun. Ha! Wake up guys. If they're arranging for Fun Day it's just hours away from Pink Slip Day.
5,Good Treats!,Good training treats and healthy for pups. One small treat can be broken into 2 or 4 for training. My dogs love them! Very good for small pets.
5,Lean Treats,"These treats are loved by big and small dogs. My daughter's Rhodesian Ridgeback and Yorkie love them. My mini dachshund loves them as well. He will do just about anything for one of these treats. They are good for training too! And, best of all they are LEAN treats that won't put the pounds on your animal."
2,Yet another misreading of Rorty,"Rothleder's book is yet another book that critiques Rorty for something that he is not guilty of. In this book Rorty is depicted as a philosopher that cannot understand true friendship. I disagree. Rorty's ironist liberal is quite capable of friendship (and yes, even in the Aristotelian way). Most of the book is almost ad hominem, referring to Rorty's childhood and attempting to show Rorty's philosophy as a vehicle of his psychoanalysis...oy vey. I liked the title so I read the book only to be disappointed in its contents. When will anyone write a book on Rorty that reads him correctly?"
2,Just not helpful,"It is rare that I write a book review, but this book is such a poor value based on price and content that I feel a moral imperative.This book is based on the Maharishi approach to yoga and meditation (TM).It is not a ""how to"" book. It is not a self help book.Rather, it provides ""scientific"" backing for why you should practice.It seems like it was an academic paper turned into a book.It provides lists of things you should do, but no explanation of how.I understand that TM is copyrighted and must be taught in person, but the author misses the boat by not providing some basic meditation instruction that could prepare someone for additional training.Essentially, this book is an extended marketing brochure for TM meditation and other Maharishi programs."
1,horrible,"I bought this book for a class I was taking and it arrived in bad shape.First, it took forever to get to me and it arrived all beat up. The book had water damage. It looked like it was through a flood or something. This made me hesitant on whether to buy any used books again."
3,Very affordable but a little outdated.,"I bought this for a university course, thinking that it would be similar to the newer ones. I liked that it was so affordable; however, being that it's from 2003, some stuff are a little outdated. I recommend buying the 2007 or current one, if you are planning to purchase an office book."
4,great book,loved this book. This is the workbook with all of the explainations on how to actually use the programs. I will keep this book until no one uses Office 03 anymore! This was a required book for class. It served its purpose. I like the spiral bound book better its easier to use at the computer.
2,"Confusing, and at times inaccurate","I used this book for an online class, books and test are bundled together and each time I took the test I had to challenge at lest one question, because it was simply wrong or inaccurate. Test quiz/test questions are non constructive for the most part. Many examples use non-standard fonts that hard to find, making assignments unnecessarily difficult to complete, in some exercises after following all instructions the correct result would not match the examples given again creating difficulty not needed. This books suited for online classes because it often gives instructions which are completely irrelevant in such environment. The books gives a good amount of tips and tricks about MS Office, books needs revising and grouping of lessons."
1,lost book,Im certain that I ordered 3 books and I only recieved 2. This is the book im missing and im a little shocked because of all the ordering I have done in the past year this has never happened to me.
2,A mixed bag,"Fisher's book does have some interesting information in it but overall the book lacks intellectual rigour and a more hard-nosed and detached approached to her topic.Still, the book is probably worth a read."
3,Mastering AutoCad 2000,The book does a good job showing you how to use AutoCad 2000 in a mechanical environment. However the book did not deal with the menu and commands found in AutoCad Mechanical 2000 that I will be using to do mechanical drafting.
3,Night and the City,"Actually, i was kind of disappointed. The movie is well done but it has an obviously outdated plot. Richhard Widmark at his best, though."
3,Mostly a good book,"I always buy Maggie Shayne's books because I love the paranormal and she is one of the genre's better writers. I enjoyed ""Eternity"" for the most part. It's a wonderfully original and inventive story clearly worthy to be a classic.However, the language and dialogues tend to be awkward at times. And certain parts are just ""too sweet"" for me."
5,I love Maggie Shayne!,"I love this book! I love the series! I have read the series several times. It was this series of books that introduced me to this type of reading. I recommend it highly. Maggie Shayne is not just a wonderful author. She is a wonderful person! I think ""Annie's Hero"" was the first of her books that I read. And then this one. That was many years ago. I have it in paperback and now on Kindle. If you like paranormal novels, get this one."
4,Not again,"I loved this book very much. I also love Maggie Shaynes work, I have introduced her to several other readers. I am not happy to see these books again. Maggie never finished the series she left us hanging. I think the problem was with a publisher but still I wanted all the books. If you start these books you will want more as well."
5,Eternity immortal witches,"Great book, want the other two. Did not want to put it down.everyone should read this book, I am sure you will like it if like books about witches."
4,"Umm, Okay","It was okay. Loved the plot about immortal witches. But the thing I didn't get was how Adrianna was going to find the body of her true love if they already ripped his heart out. That must mean his body is dead, right? So the book was the sort of ""Umm, Okay"". Might read the sequel ""Infinity."""
5,Magick words,"This book was a wonderful mix of Shayne's talent, the rich customs and traditions she creates for her novels, and the philosophies of modern Wicca. It is wonderful to see magick portrayed in such a positive and beautiful way!"
5,hard to put down!,"To say it short, this is far best the best book about this subject that I have ever read, and you just have to read it to believe it, the characters are beleivable, and it truly is a love story that spans all times."
5,Kudos!,"Thank you Maggie Shayne for writing a book and doing incredible research on the topic as well. Once I sat down and opened the book to the historical rememberences of a few of the women that were horrifically executed... I was hooked.This book was exceptionally written and had no problem whatsoever with the first person method.Great detail to the rituals and what moves a ""witch"" internally."
5,"A book of magic and romance for a long winter night, perfect","Eternity by Maggie Shayne is a book to read slow, you'll want to savor every detail and enjoy the marvelous characters, but for the most part you'll want to read slow to become part of the fantasy. This book reaches out with its magic and romance, once you start reading be prepared to read the entire book, it holds you entranced in the story until the last word, then you still want more. Maggie Shayne's story of immortality, magick, and whitchcraft will capture not only your heart but it will start you thinking about just how wonderful life is."
2,It was OK but not her best!,"The book was an ok read, fast and not too complicated, but I feel that Ms. Shayne could of done better. She is defently a genius on Vampires but her work on withches is average."
4,Fantastic story,A beautiful story that sweeps you up and takes you for a ride throughout the Times. Very enjoyable and has a fantastic plot with characters full of life and love.
2,I expected more...,"I'd heard that this book or its sequel had won some awards, so I tried it out with high hopes. Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish a book overburdened with purple prose, a predictable plot, sudden and often inexplicably-timed explicit sex, and one-dimensional characters who live only for their Eternal Love (or in the case of the villain, for his Eternal Hatred). I wanted to scream at all of them to get a life! To make matters worse, the blurb on the back cover gives away 2/3 of the book's plot. I can say as a positive point that the book did have a solid starting point for its plot with the concept of the immortal witches and how they get to be so.I hope that the author's other books feature well-rounded characters and plot twists, because this book certainly didn't. It will be quite some time before I try another Maggie Shayne book; there are too many other interesting-sounding ones to browse through here on Amazon!"
5,Eternity by Maggie Shayne,"I was fortunate enough to receive an advance reading copy of ETERNITY, and this is Maggie Shayne's best work to date. It's powerful, compelling, and deliciously intense. Don't miss this masterpiece!"
3,Great Concept -- Distracting Technique,"I liked the plot about immortal witches (both good and bad). The author has gumption for experimenting with a plot that covered several epochs.However, her viewpoint experiment didn't work for me. The heroine's scenes were told in first person, and everyone else's scenes were told in third person. Wow, was this distracting!Some of the plot twists weren't surprising at all. Also, the villain was just too villainous to be believed. Only briefly do we get to insight into his personality, and I wanted more.At All About Romance, I gave this book a C-."
3,"Can you say ""Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod?""","The three books in this series are decent reading, but for a HIGHLANDER fan, one readily recognizes Duncan MacLeod in ETERNITY, Connor in INFINITY and echos of Methos and Cassandra in DESTINY. Actually, it's a pity Maggie cleaned up the deliciously morally ambiguous Methos for her DESTINY avatar; he's much more compelling as a reformed villain."
4,good foundation,"This book provides basic information for one type of mediation. It does cover foundational theories and practices of mediation, so I believe it would be useful for any beginning mediator in any field."
5,Don't overthink it people...,"*yawn* boy, boring reviews that only serve to insult music that was never meant to be ""innovative"" by people who have no reason to listen to this music (hey, jackass--its not made for the likes of YOU anyways!) makes me wanna fall asleep. This is Oi, not emo or that crappy pop-punk, so if you saw Oxblood somewhere on a list that probably said Streetpunk and you expected Yellowcard, you deserve to be hurt very badly. This is loud, abrasive, violent, angry, sullen, simple, and real New York Oi! If you don't like it, chance are you shouldn't even be listening to it in the first place."
1,Yawn,"#1. Laughable lyrics. This is definitely music for drunken misguided morons/children who think the world revolves around their little clique at the anyown u.s.a. second rate music club. #2. Someone should tell these guys that music played by below par musicians will never sound powerful no matter how tough you try to sound. #3.Complete lack of innovation/creativity equals borrrrrriiing. There are hundreds of bands who sound exactly like this. #4. To sum it up, albums like this make me long for the comeback of 12"" vinyl albums. At least with the larger vinyl albums you could use them as frisbees if they stunk/stank/stinked."
5,Excellent book,This was a really good book. As soon as I started reading it I did not want to put it down to do anything else.
5,A heavy band that fuses aggression with jazzy instrumentatio,"Seattle's Engine Kid start off mellow, with Windshield, then erupt. Each song starts out with either tripped-out laziness or abstract heaviness, drifts off for at least 4 mins., then explodes in a whirlwind of mesmerizing drum tempoes and off-beat harmonics. The vocals range from spoken, to softly sung, to harsh screaming. The singer/guitarist Greg Anderson can be foung nowadays in Goatsnake. A masterpiece.Read WOMBAT VENGEANCE."
4,indecision,"Outside of the silly Cheesies and Gum, this is an 80's classic. Thank God it's on CD. Echo Beach was an instant hit but the gorgeous Indecision stands out here as well."
1,Cheapskate reissue,"Well I found this disc on sale elsewhere, but only discovered afterwards that the ""Faraway In time"" compilation actually contains all the tracks in this Virgin UK relase + more from other albums. The fact that this 38 minute album is released in 2003 (after the previously mentioned cd) without the entire This IS the Ice Age album (also under 40 minutes), which DINDISC/Virgin also holds the rights to, just shows how much Music labels are money-grubbing gold diggers."
2,big audio dynamite live,this seems to be edited badly only half the show i saw them may years ago in sydney & this has been cut to pieces but in saying that i loved what i saw brought back lots of memories only for true fans i felt a little bit ripped off
1,Extremely overpriced little booklet,"I purchased the ""companion"" book(let) to Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution . I was extremely disappointed when I saw it resembled not much more that the little booklets sold near the grocery store checkout area (i.e. Calory Counters, Names for Babies, etc.).The booklet itself isn't a bad little booklet, which contains carbohydrate grams, protein grams and fat grams for a lot of foods, but it's only 95 pages long, each page about 4"" by 5"", and I've seen much larger, pocketbook size carbohydrate counter books available for a lower price. I just don't think it was worth it."
2,"Not enough, too expensive for what you get.","A shame that more available food items aren't available in this LITTLE book. Shocked by the small size and content. However, the book has helped a bit, but DIET REVOLUTION has most of this material (of substance) and IS RECOMMENDED with 6 stars out of only 5 possible. Have lost 90 lbs and going for more. Thank you, Dr. Atkin... expand this book and I will appreciate paying for it."
2,RobbiesMom,I should have purchased this book from the beginning! What a savior it has been. Shipping was quick and the book is in excellent condition.
2,Very incomplete and hard to follow,"While I cannot comment on the diet itself, the book leaves much to be desired with respect to how it is presented. It is incomplete. Such an example is that there is no listing for the grams of carbohydrates in pasta, which is one of the most widely celebrated carbohydrate foods. Yet there is a listing of the carbohydrates in Dandelions. It is hard to really get to an understanding of what the no no's are...just a few examples. The charts and diagrams are not presented in a clear way, and speak more of the philosophy of the diet, rather than the instruction on how to run it. It also failed to address the common person. There are many exotic foods listed; but not even a mention of whether a glass of wine is acceptable and if so, under what terms. I'm sure that the diet has good merit, but somebody else should have written it."
1,This book is a small subset of the available information.,"Dr. Atkins' carbohydrate counter is a very small subset of the available carbohydrate information available, somewhat similar to a quick reference guide in other fields: Some information, but maybe not quite what is being sought. The organization of the book, into lists of beverages, or grains and breads, or nuts and seeds, milk and dairy, etc., makes it a bit more difficult to look up items -- why not just use the alphabet? I looked up wine -- not an umpopular item in this age -- and it was not listed. The most positive thing I can say about this book is that its small size (less that a quarter inch thick and somewhat smaller than a typical paperback) makes it a good purse or pocket book; just don't expect encyclopedic information from it."
1,Waste of Time.,"This should only be sold in the supermarket check-out lanes for 99, like other mini-books. You can tell just as much from reading the nutrition labels on the products that you buy. Some of the information doesn't seem to agree with that on the packages themselves. Which should I believe? Just using it is a ""guide"" I guess, then it's useful, but I wouldn't know if I'd feel 100% confident in it's usage for a complete detailed factual information. It's easy to follow and eas to find the item you may be looking for, but there is alot of of ""staple"" foods that isn't listed."
1,mis-leading to say the least!,"One would think that since Atkins counts only ""digestible"" carbs that the carbs in this book would be the Atkins carbs, not the total carbs. BUT, this book shows you the total carbs and no accompanying info on fiber so that you can net it out. USELESS! The Eades duo have a counter that I just ordered which is written up as giving you the ""net carbs"" that low-carb dieters need. Hopefully that will be the book I need."
4,Changed my life!,"I would have to start off by saying that Dr. Atkins is wonderful. I bought this book to help me track the number of carbs in my diet. I have been very successful by using the book and its carb levels, in fact, I would not have been as successful with the ANA if it had not been for this book. It does not have all of the foods or brands listed but it has many of the well known ones that can be found almost anywhere. I owe a huge success to this book and would recommend it to anyone who is trying to count their carbs and follow this plan. 30 pounds in a month and half should be worth something."
4,Proved helpful through diet,"This proved helpful during my dieting phase. I was able to drop from 240+ to 180 with the help of the Atkins diet revolution and this book. It's been almost 10 years and I'm now even smaller. However now, one can use smartphone or web apps, which are far easier to carry then a book."
3,A card review,"I bought this because I thought it was better than some sites which have an even better catalogue of foods.I bought this thinking that it was updated. But it is not.I think it is a waste of money, unless you do not know about the specific sites which have more information, and you are able to store and count carbs on a daily basis.There is one good thing about it. When you go out, you may not have your computer and having it in a printed out book might save you some trouble, or if you go on a holiday and you don't know what to eat when you go to Greece or Italy for example.So on that note and if you need this type of help for the little money it costs, I would recommend it."
1,Too small print.,I purchased this for my Kindle. Dr. Adkins part was fine but the list of foods showing the Carbs was so small I couldn't read it. I was unable to increase the size of the font to make it readable. Kindle refunded my money and took it off my kindle.
5,"An outstanding, convenient and EASY to carry carb guide!!!!","Love this carb counter!!! It is small enough to carry in a pocket or small pouch or purse - which means you have access to the information you need WHEN you need it! I can't tell you how many times I decided NOT to eat a particular food after looking up the carb grams... Many surprises in store for all. Everyone at work has passed my copy around, whether they are carb counters or just interested in diet and nutrition!"
2,Jubilee2014,"I like the size of this product for carrying in my purse, but find it a pain to quickly look up items. I have a larger guide that doesn't require you go to a category first (i.e. ""Vegetables""), so that if you're looking up ""tomato"" you will find it in alpha order, like a dictionary. This guide requires you first locate the category and then the food item. Because I only wanted this guide as a quick reference while out, I don't find it that quick and easy to look up items."
1,"portable, but not in-depth","This book (more a pamphlet) is very portable, but it doesn't provide in-depth carbohydrate, fat, and protein counting. Most of the information I read is right off product labels. For example, I can read the egg carton to know the numbers for eggs, but what about calculating grams for yokes and whites separately?"
1,Not very good for the money.....,This book was a big disappointment... not nearly enough information. There are several much better informative books (at the same price or less) Shop for something else..
3,When i tried it the first time it worked.,I believe the reason why my metabolism isn't working because of expired flour i ate.I started having problems.Please try to help to find a cure for my problem.With your diet my son lost 40LBS.
2,"Incomplete, poor measure choices","This pricey pocket guide disappoints as often as it informs. Dr Atkins reprises an error from his New Diet Revolution: he measures solids as liquids. For example, during the Induction phase, he recommends three cups (""loosely packed"") of salad or two cups salad and 2/3 cup cooked vegetable. Doc: ""cups"" are for liquids! Tell me how many ounces!! This really rings true when he listes cooked items.This tiny guide repeats the error. I don't want to try stuffing my cooked carrots in a cup measure: tell me how many ounces! Most of us have a scale with a tare feature. Don't make me try to ""loosely"" pack a measuring cup with the endive leaves I want to leave whole to accept a stuffing. Sheesh.Don't get me wrong: I LOVE the diet. It works. But if you charge $... for a carb counter, use WEIGHTS for solids and make it more than a couple of pages per category (it really could be far more complete)."
4,Lower Carbohydrate Eating for Weight Loss and Health,"As the author of the first ""insulin-conscious"" gourmet cookbook (""The Gourmet Prescription: High Flavor Recipes for Lower Carbohydrate Diets""), I'm 100% behind the carbohydrate information explosion. The serious consequences of our 10-year carbohydrate orgy (epidemics of obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes), make this book a necessary resource. A great life, however, requires more than a gram counter. We need FLAVOR as well as information-- and that's where ""The Gourmet Prescription"" comes in. All of the recipes are about intensifying flavor as well as lowering carbohydrates. It's a food lover's antidote to our carbohydrate binge and a great companion to any lower carbohydrate diet."
1,not reccomended,"dont recomend it, many people who go on the atkins diet end up with liver problemsthe diet works, but at what long term health cost?"
1,free riding rubbish,"Would you buy a rubber screwdriver because it was marked ""George Bush Tools Inc.""? I hope not. When will people stop buying ""branded"" junk? This minibook is far inferior to plenty of nutritional guides available out there. Get off this Atkins rage."
1,Great way to have less money,"If you want to get rid of a few bucks you can do it quickly by buying this and other books meant to rip off fat people. Or you can throw that money in the trash, or burn it in the fire place. Either way you will weigh the same in the end.Or you could eat better, get regular exercise, lose weight and feel good about yourself."
4,great and portable,very small - but filled with almost every product you can think of - take it with me everywhere - just wish some things didn't have so many darn carbs! I'm still trying to not go over 30 grams per day but it can be difficult.
1,By no means the best available,"Don't bother with this book! It isn't wrong or inaccurate, understand, it is simply woefully small. I highly recommend Corrinne Netzer's Carb Counter book--almost 500 pages of listings, broken down in almost unbelievable detail. Carb listings for nearly ever imaginable *brand* of a food item. Dr. Atkin's book pales in comparison, believe me."
4,You cant take it with you,"This is a handy little book and by the way it certainly does have the carb counts for pasta, a previous commentator missed it. Look under ""pasta and rice"". I wish it did have the number of nuts you can eat instead of ounces. I don't carry a food scale to know what an ounce of nuts is. Otherwise, it is worth it because it has a brief introduction to the diet and the size makes it easy to carry with you. I think Dr. Atkin's deserves a medal for standing for what he knows is right. I highly recommend his diet for a way of life."
4,Very good as a SUPPLEMENT to the New Diet Revolution,"I've read all the comments made about this book and would like to offer the following. This booklet is not meant to be used to ""follow"" the diet. It is a companion to The New Diet Revolution which is essential reading for anyone on this diet. I have been on it for several weeks now and I'm at the ""maintenance"" stage. For those of you who are looking up wine in the Carb Counter booklet, it is not listed simply because wine is made with grapes (the highest sugar content fruit) and sugar isn't allowed on this diet."
4,"Scanned friend's copy, liked it & decided to give it a try.","I have been on this diet since March 19 and have lost 17 pounds. The diet is easy to follow and I get plenty to eat, never getting hungry between meals. After the 14 day induction diet, I began adding more vegetables and fruits, as the book suggests, and continue to lose a pound per week. The secret is to be creative with your menus. I feel great. My friends say I look great and years younger. My husband & sons have changed their eating habits as well. All this gives me the incentive to continue. The diet truly alters your eating lifestyle and the entire family is healthier."
4,A good supplement to the New Diet Revolution,"If you are serious about the diet, you should buy the book. By the way, wine, beer etc. are listed under alcohol."
1,too tiny,I don't think the kindle is the place for this book. It is so small I can't read it. When I make the letters bigger it is distorted.
5,stunning,"This is a delightful record. The selections were chosen with care. It was Peter Grant's voice and his deliverance that made me fall off my chair. He has a beautiful voice and express the diction with clarity. Pity though because he is British and not from North America. Cast aside clones like Michael Buble, Steve Tyrell, Rod Stewart( Ugh!!!!) and their like fodder. This is the real thing if you like good music.Will someone from the US listen to him and give him the exposure that he deserves? Music listeners from all over the world are starving for good music. This CD together with Smokey Robinson's last recording stand tall above the rest of the muzak."
1,This controller is junk,"This is the same controller as the Phillips brand, and it's total garbage. The analog sticks work okay, but the unforgivable part is the d-pad. You can press up and down or left and right at the same time. (actually, up/down/left/right can all be pressed at once, just by pressing down in the middle of the d-pad). This makes the controller completely useless for emulated games, platformers, side-scrolling shooters, or any game for which the d-pad is the primary input. When both up and down are pressed at the same time, most games have no idea what to do, and your character will just not move, or will do something totally unexpected.If you're going to use this stick for Quake type first person shooters or a flight sim or some game that uses the analog sticks, it will be okay. Not great, but okay. But for old school gaming, this is not the controller for you."
2,This movie feels like an acid trip,"This is very strange, I would only recomend this to fans of Burrough's more cut up experimental books. This reminds me of an acid trip it is very bizarre. One short film just has a bizarre picture of some sort of skulls on the screen and it has Burroughs repeating one short sentence over and over again. Bill and Tony is extremely bizarre it involves Burroughs and another person stood next to each other one saying ""I am Bill"" and one saying ""I am Tony"" Then Tony will tell a story then the same sequence will start again with Bill telling the story, then Tony will become Bill etc and the story is told around 8 times in different ways. This dvd is basically unwatchable but it is great to have in your collection if your a true fan of Burroughs. Also if you dabble with music the Bill and Tony film would be amazing to sample."
1,You might think the 2nd book would improve the story,"If the first book was a struggle then this one was pure torture. Once again we are subjected to mountains of macabre deaths while the protagonist consistently regresses each time you THINK he will grow from the events around him. The female counterpoint is pure stereotype and if you can't guess the ending by the fourth chapter then you might have a chance at enjoying this author's work. McIntosh has managed to make the second book move the story backwards, a trick I have not seen done before. The glaring question is WHY?"
4,He's done it again!,"Another great book by the master of entertaining books about Marine Biology. If you are a Richard Ellis fan, this is a ""must buy"". If you are interested in a great history of the mysteries and discoveries of what lies beneath the waves, it is also a ""must buy"".The book does slightly overlap with some other of this authors books.It has some very fresh information on the Giant Squid, and also that strange otherworldly life found deep in the depths."
3,Woodworker,Was under the impression this was double stick tape...it is not and did not work for our project...we will keep looking.
3,Different than I remembered,"Bought this for my child and I guess Star Wars figures are different than what I remembered playing with as a kid.The main negatives are: strangely articulated arms and easily breakable saber.1. The right arm is locked in a permanent salute and the left is at a similarly strange angle. You can turn them a tiny bit but that's it.2. The light saber has one side that easily comes out (so as to mimic the fact that his double saber gets broken in the film) and the other part is easily bent/broken. Honestly though, that's probably to be expected--it's a small toy after all.That said, it looks very much like the character and my child enjoys it (he just doesn't play with the light saber part much due to the fact that it's missing somewhere in the house 90% of the time)."
3,Good Content; Poor Editing,"The book is informative and entertaining, and I'm glad I read it. But there were *dozens* of typographical errors. The section on SMEAT alone had at least one per page. And the author is entirely too fond of exclamation points. The author needed an editor to rein in his worst tendencies, and the publisher desperately needed a proofreader, full stop.As for content, the book didn't have as many stories about life aboard Skylab and adjusting to zero-G as I would have liked, but it had a lot of information about the various experiments that ""Homesteading Space"" either glosses over or skips.If you only want to read one book on Skylab, ""Homesteading Space"" is better. If you want to read several books then this book is a worthwhile addition. I'd have given it 4 stars if the publishing quality was better."
5,Yes you have to own....,"All music made by Voiceless is great, if your ever feeling down, just hear this music, it will relax you and take you on to another level of listening. It's hard to explain how the music sounds, has a little bit of everything mixed into one. I've personally known James for awhile and he puts his heart and soul into his music, he's a great artist. I guarantee you would love it, so try it out for yourself and see...you wont regret it!"
5,Astounding,"I can hardly find words for this release- I went to the Mp3.com and Turan Music sites to find more information on Voiceless- So far, this is the third release from James Hopkins- Central Musician/programmer/etc of the constantly revolving group- For the last 2 years- Voiceless has been him but in the past it's included Anji Bee (now with love spirals), Kevin Corren & Robert Hazelton (ex-abney park/servitude). Anyways- this cd is simply astounding- The quality is stellar, while keeping the listener captivated.so far- they have gotten 21,000 downloads on mp3.com and are climbing!!"
3,The History of Fashion,"A quaint little overview of the history of fashion, but some of the information seems dated(even for the HISTORY of it).The internet and other articles would be best for informal data about it.Quality: 3/5Price: 5/5Writing: 5/5TRUE FASHION THROUGH THE AGES: 100/5"
1,Outdated,"All throughout this book there are concepts that no longer apply, and defenitions that are not correct. This book is not relevant."
5,Up The Punx!,"This c-d is top-notch streetpunk at its finest! The casualties are a very fast-paced streetpunk/oi! band that sing about loving punk and getting drunk. This cd compiles their first seven inches, when they had two singers(jorge & colin), as well as their first appearences ever on compiliations and even their 10 song demo from 1990. the quality of most of the songs are kinda bad, but that gives it the punk rock feel! this is a must for casualties fans seeing how practically everything on this album is out of print. and if you havent heard the casualties yet, i don't know what you are waiting for!"
3,Errors,"The book has good explanations of concepts, but has many typos that should not have slipped by. For example, the very first chapter states Euler's formula to be e^(i*theta) = sin theta + i sin theta. Overall a good learning tool."
1,Totally overpriced and overwhelmingly silly...,"This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature. A true non-value. If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something."
1,What a surprise!,"When I opened this order, I was totally surprised. I thought someone had made a mistake and sent me some advertising literature. I have actually received bigger and better ""free"" info from advertisers. This is listed as a 16 page book, but is just a 12 page brochure. Don't waste your money making the writers of this book(?) richer!"
1,Wrong description,"I ordered this expecting to get a Plextor UltraPlex 40max CD drive. Instead I was shipped a Plextor UltraWide CD drive with 68 pin SCSI vs 50 pin SCSI. I returned it and was given full credit for the purchase but lost $20 in round trip shipping. It came from DealStop - an Amazon Marketplace seller who normally charges a restock fee of 20%. I paid $49 and they have it on their own website (with the proper description) for $39. So, in effect, I paid the restock fee before I even got it. Bummer!"
1,misleading,"The item pictured here is in the factory box and the title says it comes with VoiceXpress.Even though I felt the deal was too good to be true, i ordered it anyway. When it came, it turned out to be an outdated soundcard that doesn't work with Windows XP, and the L&H; Voice Express software? no. not included. What WAS included was a burnt CD including install files for VLC media player, Audacity, and Itunes. I -guess- the drivers for the soundcard were on there (somewhere) but I didn't bother looking.do not buy this product. It is completely and totally not what is advertised here."
3,Not so cool,"I bought this toy for my son who is having difficulty in math (mainly fractions, but I thought this may help us get a good foundation), he did not enjoy it and was very bored through out it. Maybe it was too simple for him, I don't know."
5,I loved this,album when I was in high school and still do. Pete Rock is a genius and shines on this album.
3,"Don't believe the hype, cop it if you're a big fan of Pete R","I was expecting beats, beats and more beats. Maybe my expectations were just to high. But the beats here were not as impressive as I expected them to be. The guest artists were definitely nice, but this album just doesn't seem to be the type that will get nationwide appeal such as Jay-Z, Outkast, DMX, etc. If you're a fan of Pete Rock, Hip-hop true to its east coast roots, or any of the guest artists go ahead and get it. You'll probably enjoy it. If you're looking for the 2nd coming of ""The Chronic"" or something that will be a classic album by a producer: Sorry, this just isn't it."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"As a HUGE fan of the Pete Rock and CL Smooth duo, I was hoping for more of the same from Pete Rock's solo debut. Unfortunately, he disappears from the album early on and provides only an occasional verse here and there. This album might be better titled as a hip-hop compilation produced by Pete Rock since about 3/4 of the rhyming is done by guest rappers.In any case, I'm sure my expectations were much too high for this album which is why I was pretty disappointed. All in all, it isn't bad, but doesn't contain any of the infectious beats and intelligent lyrics that were the trademark of his past work with CL."
1,This is an update of my previous glowing review,"I purchased my first brewstation and was very pleased and wrote a glowing review. Well 2 months to the day of the purchase, it stopped working. After emailing Amazon, they told me they were sending me a return label to send it back. Three weeks later I finally received it and sent it back. I saw that they had reduced the price, so thinking I just had bad luck I ordered another and received it today. Cleaned it and ran a full pot through to clean, and my shower head leaks less. I have had tremendous luck with refurbished products in the past, but, I would not waste your time on this one. My mother bought a new one around Christmas and hers works great still. I guess I will go that route. I really like the concept of this brewstation, I just suggest you purchase it elsewhere."
1,I'd give it zero stars if that was an option,"I owned 2 of these units in the space of 6 months. When the first one had problems after a few months, I assumed I had just overworked it or gotten water into something vital. The second unit didn't last 2 months before it started doing the same thing the first one did (the 'on' light flashing not allowing a reset without unplugging and reconnecting the unit). I went to HB's web site and e-mailed customer service a thorough description of the problem. I NEVER received an e-mail response. I did receive a packet of coffeemaker de-scaler in the mail with no accompanying correspondence. Believe me when I say, as a coffee maker/drinker for over 45 years, I KNOW when a coffeemaker needs de-scaling and can handle that without help. That will be my last Hamilton Beach appliance due to a total lack of customer service."
2,Don't buy refurbished,"We had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out. When I saw the refurbished for $20.00 I thought it was a great deal. It would have been if it had come with all the parts and didn't leak!! It didn't come with seals or with the water purifier. I tried everything including new seals (that I bought separately). Eventually we just went out and purchased a new one, because we still like the model."
3,SUPERB,"The Whispers are from the Bay Area and so whenthey first started out they were unbelieveable!!They've only gotten seasoned and better. ThanksBarbara from Fairfield, Ca."
5,Great educational fun game.,Purchased this for my first grader. I used this game as incentive to do homework! My child loves this game.
4,Vacation Planning Assistance In Your Pocket,We are planning a trip to Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon Park in the near future and these books by lonely planet are invaluable at saving time and money in helping plan for the perfect vacation experience. While it is true you could find some of the information that is in these books online it would take days and days of research if not weeks to compile it and then edit what is factual and what is not helpful at all. The lonely planet people have been there and know what they are doing and know what you are looking for and how to help you find what you are looking for even if you dont have a clue what you are looking for at the moment.Filled with great pictures and suggestions on places to stay and where to eat. Outlines tons of things to do and places to see with reviews from experts.Get the book and make a plan. Life is waiting.
4,A Guide To the Tetons and Yellowstone,For one contemplating a trip to Yellowstone and the Tetons this book will be a fine handbook and guide.It is very detailed in regards to information about the parks and offers the reader a fine source of information for things to do on your visit.
3,"I had no problems, but I sent the book as a gift and really don't know what it looks like.","I had no problems, but I sent the book as a gift and really don't know what it looks like."
2,As a backup source,"For general planning of our trip, this book provided some useful information but the book does not give enough detail for a day to day planner."
4,"good introductory book, to be complemented with another guide","This is a good companion book to explore Yellowstone. But do keep in mind that the Tetons and Yellowstone NPs are so big, no guide will be extensive enough to cover all the parts of the parks and related activities. This lonely planet guide is a good way to get some pointers and help you out to plan your trip, giving you the highlights of the parks, but you will certainly need topo maps, or some hiking guides should you need to explore a particular area in depth. Nonetheless, this book is well written and does what it's supposed to do, i.e. orient you and give you an idea of what is out there for you to see. Should you need more specific info, just use the guide as a starting point and google up the rest (or buy another more specific books that pertains to driving or hiking or whatever you want to do in these parks)."
4,Handy Companion for a visit to some spectacular country,"Lonely Planet's Yellowstone & Grand Teton National Parks guidebook is useful for those traveling to these two national parks. Most helpful are the itineraries for day and overnight hikes and the recommendations for restaurants and lodgings. As it is impossible to keep up to date on every change, the book was largely accurate regarding rates and menus with just a few exceptions. The area of the book that could use the most improvement is the maps, especially in the Grand Teton area where the way that regions of the park were split up over several pages created confusion and constant page turning in order to follow a road throughout the park. I would recommend a fold-out map that one could use to see more of the roads and destinations without page flipping. In general, though, the guide is easy to use and presents its information in a reasonably concise manner. I can recommend it as a handy companion for your trip to this area."
4,Made My Trip Easier,"I've visited the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Parks before, but always missed out on many things to do and see. This book provides guidance in lodging and sightseeing that is in dispensible. Only wish it contained some photographs."
3,"Small maps, heavy hiking","Used Lonely Planet guidebooks throughout India and Europe. This edition is choppy and difficult to follow. Tried to make sense of it and pull out what we could to plan but gave up after 3 days. Couldn't get a feel for the park or the sights, nor an overview. Sent it back"
4,"Usual Lonley Planet Publication, Good at what it does.","For the everyday traveller, I find the Lonley Planet guides as good as anything else on the market. This book is no exception. Covers all topics I require for basic travel information in a foreign country, maps, accommodation options, itinerary suggestions. I look foward to our few days at Yellowstone."
1,From a Disappointed Reader,"This book has three unrecoverable defects:[1] Extremely poor quality topography. Unreadable type in many places, espercially toward the bottom of the page and horrendously poor scanned photos -- better with none than these atrocities,[2] A superficial commentary on Naval brass during WW2. Other than a closed and obdurate mind, no mention of Admiral King's significant personal failings with the bottle and ladies . . insufficent attention to the triumphs of VADM Charles Lockwood such has conclusively proving the defects of American torpedoes used by WW2 submarines for some three years and the use of science/technology to defeat mine fields and Admiral Doenitz's forray into politics to the point of becoming Hitler's legal successor and doing a ten-year hitch in Spandu prison.[3] An outrageous price for such a poor, flawed product.Stay away from this tukey!"
4,Death Duel of Kungfu Review,"This is the best film with Wang Tao and John Liu together. It has some good fighting scenes. Very good footwork by John Liu. I always liked this film when I was a kid, and have seen it dubbed in three different languages. The bad guy (Han Yin) was superb. Great music too, taken from the Clint Eastwood Western ""Hang 'em High"".I don't know about the DVD quality, but I would recommend this film to anyone. Also check out ""Secret Rivals"" with this duo."
4,The Death Duel of Kung Fu - A MUST SEE CLASSIC!,"The fighting scenes awesome. I'm talking about the guy with the tremendous kicking and splitting abilities. If you want to see a guy wax the behind of his enemies while being doubled and trippled teamed by splitting and kicking - well this is the flick for you. In my opinion this guy is the real star of this flick. He brings the real energy here. I'm telling you his kicks are devestating! No swords, no knives, no partners - NO PROBLEM!The other guy ((Lo Lieh), he was a little lame throughout but in the end when he teamed up with the leg fighter to beat up the classic white haired villan he seemed to come alive. The plot is there - at least it has one! This is a must see classic for all old school Kung Fu fans.The last fighting scene was totally awesome as well as a bit funny to me. There's nothing like a flying punch in your face unawares! I'm glad they brought this one to DVD!"
2,Quiet until it stops then BANG!,"This is not a terrible AC. In fact, I would have given it 5 stars. It has a wonderful power saver mode were it turns off completely and every once in awhile comes on to check if the room has gotten too warm. It cools very well and sends out nice cold air. While operating, it is nice and quiet. All in all, a great choice.... ....except.... EXCEPT. Whenever this machine goes from cooling to just air, the compressor inside gives a HUGE jolt and a very loud and startling BANG! You could never sleep with this thing around. It is scaring the crap out of us regularly and we know exactly what it's going to do, but it's just so loud and so surprising. Yes, the whole thing is very well mounted in place. It's not the machine moving against anything, it's coming from inside the machine itself. Now I know why this was a Gold Box item... Live and learn."
1,I can't believe people actually liked this song...,"The Pizza Dance has got to be one of the worst songs ever recorded. Bigger than Mambo #5 or the Macarena? Come ON! Tony Modica should stick to making pizza, not singing about it."
5,A must have!,A great book for any expectant father! It's a fun read that really helps men understand more! A great shower gift too!
1,Don't waste your money...,Because you'll need it when the baby gets here. You can learn everything else on the fly.
4,Good information for the oblivious,"The book provides simple, concise information about pregnancy, which every father-to-be should be aware of. There were even a few issues that my wife had not heard about before, but found them to be accurate when she questioned the doctor. However, for most of you very involved fathers-to-be, much of the information will come as no surprise, as you will, most likely, have already heard it from your wife's doctor. Nevertheless, the book is so informative that my wife decided to read it, also. My one disappointment was that the title of the book implies a toung-in-cheek approach, but, for the most part, the book is very dry. Easy reading. Most people should be able to read it in a few days."
3,Not a Bad Book,"This was a gift from my parents to my husband. While my husband is very supportive, he isn't much into reading a lot of different books. So, this gave the overview of things he needed to know about pregnancy itself while he was able to concentrate his efforts on more practical books for him (like The Birth Partner).If you are someone who is planning a natural, unmedicated birth, this book could be somewhat of a turn-off at times because it is a little heavy into the medicalized birth. However, because the book focuses primarily on pregnancy itself, rather than childbirth, the portion of it dedicated to a medicalized approach is relatively brief.All in all, we found the book to be useful. It is definitely not a go-to guide, and it could have been organized a bit better, but other than that it was worth a read for my husband."
5,Loved This Book!,"I could not put this extraordinary book down because it is filled with Universal Laws to improve the quality of life. I did not know what to expect when I selected this book, but I have been pleasantly reminded by someone whose career and life has gone through life's changes about God's goodness. Rev. Run did an excellent job of putting these spiritual truths in a manner that can be followed easily to change the tides of one's fortunes.This was an excellent piece that won't be soon forgotten."
5,The Kings Forever!,I thought this book was a great book to read. I myself have been a Run DMC fan since i was like 8. Im 18 now. They influenced me so much and They should be on the walk of fame not to mention on the next grammys to except alot off awards for the work they have done. As far as the book. I thought it told it all. Its a very good book and i give it five stars.
3,Wrong pilot bit size,"The pilot bit is 9/32"" not 1/4"". The mandrel is of a decent quality and works fine with the Vermont American 7/8"" carbon hole saw."
1,Less than ONE star,"This item is not Vermont American but some junk. Very light weight material so I am almost afraid to use it for fear of it coming apart in my face.I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want ""quality"" and value your eye sight..I left a similar comment last month [Nov 07]. and was contacted by the seller and asked to delete my comment for a ""partial refund"". They promised that this item would be re-identified properly. I told them I was not interested in a ""refund"" and that advertising this as Vermont American was tantamount to [...]. For some reason this did not get posted as a comment here and the item description has not been corrected..BewareEdit to note: Don't know why this comment is dated 19 November since I only posted it yesterday 25 Dec.."
3,Alright,"Nothing really new, possibly the whole girl not wanting to commit is a slightly new twist. It was just alright. Laughed a couple of times, teared up once, so not a complete waste of time."
3,Predictable,"It was a cute movie. As anything that Ashton Kutxher does, it dissent take a lot of thinking. It was enjoyable enough to watch once."
1,No Strings attached: First time I ever gave a terrible review,"I watched the movie for approc 3/4 of it and turned it off...to the news about our trillion dollar defcit and the blizzard in my part of the country and also some lunatic loose in California. Sad as all of those events are they were more interesting than this movie. Maybe if I were younger it might have seemed funny. However at age 56 I am known for my sense of humor. If there were a ""no star rating"" this movied would get it. I have Amazon Prime so I was able to watch it for free. If I had to pay for it I would recommend forgetting it."
3,It was ok. Just didn't seem it had any depth. Nothing to bragg about,It will pass the time. I had nothing better to do. Would not want to see it again anytime soon.
2,Not - Bad,This movie dragged - it was cute and funny in some places. Overall better than the really stupid comedies - watching it once was enough.
3,RomCom for the pessimist,"This is coming from someone who is not a fan of romantic comedies. Its a cute movie and it follows the typical romantic comedy formula. But overall it was enjoyable to watch, the acting was decent and there were even a few genuine laughs."
1,Movie of Low Standards,"This movie has no depth except the type that contends with hope in a more perfect and moral world. Knowing that a large number of people in foreign nations watch American movies, I can understand why they call Americans stupid and immoral once watching a portion of this movie. Instead of watching the whole film, I decided to bleach out my brain to wash out some of the utter uselessness of the constant scenes of selfish, lazy-minded examples of how not to live one's life."
1,spend you time on something else,"I had hopes for this one, good talent a plausible plot but it just went no where and very slowly. try some yoga, pick up some trash, talk a stroll or read a good book... life's short, do something else with your time"
1,this is some shallow-arsed garbage,"this is one of those flicks that make me wanna lock myself in the bathroom and engage in a bowel movement. yes, a bowel movement is at least ""mildly entertaining"". only thing that's worse is sitting through any given angelina jolie movie. they couldn't even think of an original plot, wasn't there like at least one other ""friends with benefits"" movie out there?"
1,Half Star,"Please movie writers, we need more sex and drugs in our movies. Please??? There is just not enough these days and I think what society is missing is more degenerates that make this country so great.If you thought the above comment by me was a correct analysis of what we as people should be, then you will absolutely love this movie. So enjoy. For the rest of us with a brain in our heads, move on and hope someone will make a great movie one day. TC"
3,Natalie Portman's character was clinically insane in this movie.,"Alright, reviewing the actual movie: Typical RomCom. Guy falls in love with girl, girl only likes guy. Blah blah blah. We've seen these types of movies before. No Strings Attached is not a bad RomCom, nor a great RomCom. Right in the middle really.Although what I really want to talk about is the crazy, bi-polar, and ridiculously screwed up character that Natalie Portman plays. The constant back and forth between wanting more, then wanting less just drove me crazy. It seriously reminded me of the bi-polar and unstable patients I met during my nursing career. Just wanted to get that out there. The character she portrays in this movie needs some serious help.That is all! Check it out if you want, some might be disappointed, others might enjoy it. Tough call on this one!"
3,No Strings Attached,"Classic romantic comedy except this time the guy falls in love with a girl who doesn't want to have a relationship... In the end, just like with all romantic comedies, they wind up together after she realizes she doesn't want to be without him. Awwww. Predictable (obviously) but still entertaining. Nothing to write home about, but Natalie Portman does a great job at being lovable."
3,"It's cute and fun, but I wouldn't watch it again.",It is a good movie for a girls night. It didn't take much attention to keep up with what was gonig on.
3,Not bad,Not bad but could have been a lot better with some more work or maybe on the script.Had good actors and director.
4,So good!,"I like this movie because Natalie Portmanteau and Ashton Kutcher have great chemistry which makes this movie more realistic! I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh, cry, and just feel the love!"
5,Great movie,"I love this movie! Natalie Portman is my favorite actress and she is great in this, as always. I love her sense of humor... her comedic timing is impressive. Ashton Kutcher is typically pretty silly in his films, but did a good job in this. Kept his aloofness to a minimum and the chemistry between Natalie and Ashton, while palpable at times, made for a really great movie!!"
3,No Strings Attached:,"can it be done..a no-strings relationship?? absolutely but this shows the, perhaps, flexibility of both sides .... the film would have been better without the suddenly and usual today reversal of ""typical"" character-roles in no-strings relationships ... why was he so surprised at the no-strings attitude???Ashton Kutcher was not, however, very believable .. a bit kitschy and Natalie Portman's performance was trying too hard to retain the distance ... A no-strings relationship is OK and the film was OK."
1,Money Making Formula,"Outside of a few funny lines and outside of a good money making day for all studio staff involved this flick is a two-weeks-from-now forgettable 90 minutes. It's actually a bit sad to see Kutcher's talent wasted on formula romantic comedies, but again it's good pay for a day's work which is about how long it takes to make these. The important criticism is that the storyline is a quilt of ideas borrowed (meaning: many times recycled) from other rom-com flicks e.g. detached, insecure chick, whose a bit smarter than the lowly gardener (usually a gardener or some manual trade that allows physiques to be shown); dumb romantic enticements such as fast food restaurants and veggies for flowers; friends to act as either rational or provocateur foils - all done before. Oh, and the usual (funny to film crew) same camera angled sex scenes seen in every similar movie."
4,no strings attached,This is a truly amazing love story well written directed and acted i enjoyed all of it and haveadded it to my list of watch it again movies
4,liked it,JerksIt Was Funny And Kinda Off Beat. I Loved The Characters In The Story Even The Ones That Are supposed To Be Jerks Were Likeable.
3,Great for a lazy Sunday afternoon,"It's a typical Hollywood movie, if you go in not expecting much, it's a halfway decent movie. Natalie Portman does a great job pulling on your emotional string a few times in the movie, she's a great actor. Could've cast someone other than Kutcher to pair with her. Either way, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon."
4,Boy Pines For Girl,Most movies portray as the girl falling in love first. This movie was a refreshing change showing where the boy falls in love first and then the girl to come to the realization she is in love too. The atmosphere between the two actors was awesome. I was dead tired when I was watching the film and the humor and fun of the piece was a second wind of straight laughter.
2,Way too much sugar syrup. Needs salt.,"Beautiful people with unlimited energy and money. The plot barely exists. I suppose that as fluff it could be worse, but I would rather waste my time on fluff that's not quite so sugary. The attempts to develop the characters, even the main ones, are slimy thin. The premise is interesting enough, so I give a second star. A little salt or grist would have made it more palatable."
1,Ashton Kutcher shows why some people should just not try to act.,"So I thought maybe this would be a fun movie...nope. Ashton Kutcher managed to bring all of the talent to this that he demonstrated on That 70s Show, which is to say none. Outside of a few funny lines this movie adds nothing to the entertainment industry other than being a giant rotting cabbage that is the garbage heap that Hollywood has become. If you're a fan of Family Guy or Keeping up with the Kardashians than maybe this will be dumbed down enough for you to enjoy, otherwise spend your time doing something more entertaining, like maybe scrubbing a floor with a tooth brush."
1,Horrible Classless Script,"I was embarrassed to see Kevin Klein in this movie, participating in the propaganda myth that people are old at 58. For god's sake, I am 57 and know well what a f*** buddy is! My generation may have even invented the term. I would love to be able to watch a comedy that does not mention fingering or eating someone out in the first 12 minutes. I thought that was reserved for trash like ""Porky's Revenge"". The tradition and appeal of a good romantic comedy is its innocence, which happens with great infrequency in this film as a result of the occasional vulgarity which has sadly become part of our mainstream culture. ""That hole is my b****"", bellows Portman in a miniature golf scene. How sad to see what we have become. A show like ""Sex in the City"" would have dealt with this topic, which is a great premise, with far more class and humor."
4,No Strings Attached,"Natalie Portman in a romantic comedy, good movie in which she shows her sexy body and acting skills. I liked it."
2,Unimaginative plot,"This is pretends to be a new kind of boy pursues girls story -- boy meets girl but girl thinks she doesn't have time for anything more than sex. When things get close, girl rejects boy. Boy starts dating others. Girl realizes she actually loves him and has to be his one and only.The premise makes a sideways glance at the idea of friends with benefits -- relationships that say a couple can have sex without all the traditional levels of commitment, but does nothing to explore the idea.Likewise, the story does little to add any depth to the old fashioned romance story it actually is.Low marks for innovation, low marks for elegance in retelling a timeworn stereotype.Add to that, the male lead has no charisma and his character has few elements to make him interesting. A little character depth for both the boy and the girl character would have added a lot.Oh well.Not recommended."
3,Cute,Absent minded escapism. I was surprised by the performance of these pretty people :)I watched it at a time when I just did not want to think. It was cute.
2,No strings attached,"I'm sorry,but I guess I'm just too old for some of these movies.It's not the content,but,the language that botheres me so much.I lived for most of my life(in Chicago)without having these words in my daily conversations. I didn't watch the movie past the first 20 min.or so,I can't make a comment on that."
4,"Corny and cute, what else did you expect?","This isn't a movie full of plot twists, or even particularly good writing. The characters are just well enough developed to make them endearing, but not well enough to throw you any surprises. The actors (Portman, Kutcher, and Klein, particularly) are overqualified for the sometimes strained lines that they deliver, and the jokes are (mostly) corny and easy, but there are more than a few that will still make you laugh out loud. That being said, this movie is better than the above would make it sound. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for Natalie Portman, but this movie is cute to the point of redeeming. The plot doesn't have to have twists, its a romantic comedy. This film is as advertised, for sure. It will make you laugh, and say ""awwww"", and try to snuggle up closer to the person you're watching with, but isn't that exactly what you wanted?"
4,Worth watching more than once!,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this movie! Aston Kutcher is an awesome actor! This was definitely a great role for him! This movie made me laugh and managed to make me drop a tear or two!"
3,review,Entertainig but not veryexciting. I would watch it again but only because I already own it. Why do I need four more words?
4,Very cute and feel good kinda movie,"Was it the best movie ever? No, but it was a good watch for an evening home on the couch. Definitely finished watching it with a smile on my face. The boy gets the girl and a few hiccups in-between. I liked it a lot."
1,"waste of actors, film and time","awful, raunchy, and a waste of time. I thought it would be a funny film. But should be thrown in the trash. I would give it a 1/2 star if that was a choice."
3,Cookie-cutter Rom-Com,"Entertaining if you have time to kill, but completely predictable. It wasn't a horrible movie, and the characters were at least likable- though Natalie Portman's character was less so. Wouldn't watch this movie again, and wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it, unless you really like the romantic comedy genre and don't even mind sitting through the latest Katherine Heigl or Gerard Butler dud."
4,Entertaining,"It was a pleasant romantic comedy about two people being friends with benefits. The chemistry between them is quite good and interesting. They ultimately do fall for each other, though only after the drama surrounding it. A good movie though."
3,Just OK,"The movie had a lot of twists and turns, however, the overall storyline was pretty predictable. I did not expect the cursing and explicit language and think it would have been a better movie without it."
3,Oh soooooo Predictable,Felt like I was watching Friends with Benefits again (same story line)......albeit with different casts. Nothing original about it. Knew what would happen just by looking at the title lol.
3,Doctors act like High Schol Students,"So, if you want to watch doctors act like high school students and torment each other and fight.....this is the movie for you. It was a bit slow in the beginning but the pace picks up after a while. Even though this movie wasn't for me I watched it to the end and I was entertained so.....3 stars. It wasn't horrible but not my thing."
1,After about 10 interuptions of,"stopping, I decided to move to Netflix which played the movie without any pauses for through out. I'm sorry but that proved to me that your servers are not very good."
2,I lost intrest quickly.,I guess I didn't get far enough into the movie to appreciate it. It just took to long to get to the point.
1,Sickening,"I hated everything about this movie and I am amazed Natalie Portman is in this type of movie. Raunchy, immature, idiotic humor, I had to stop it when she decided to have sex with Ashton after he woke up from a night of blackout drinking. Who the heck would do that, I have no idea. Frat party scenes, talk of oral sex, the humor couldn't get any lower. Do not waste an moment on this movie, no wonder it is free to rent on amazon."
1,Worse Movie Ever,"So, so, so bad. How could someone write something this pathetic? I couldn't finish it. Natalie Portman has done so much better than this. Really diminished her acting ability and my respect for her ability to pick a role."
2,Unbearably bad...,After an hour I could not take the crass jokes and terrible acting. Skip this one at all costs.
1,"Cheesy, saccharine chick flick","People simply do not behave the way these Pretty People all behave. Basically, the premise here is that people jump in and out out bed without much, or any, thought and that the jumping is the subject of endless vulgar discussion over cocktails or dinner. Put another way, this film is vulgar nonsense. Nothing wrong with that if it is also entertaining, but really, this film is a clean miss. Fortunately I watched it via my Amazon Prime membership and did not pay a penny to see it. Had I in fact paid as much as one cent it would have been a rip-off.Some nice looking eye candy for the guys and beefcake for the gals, but other than that this film has no redeeming features whatever. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere and it never did. RJB."
3,"Had Its Moments, But Kutcher and Portman Never Quite Gelled","I like both Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher but they have very different strengths - his is comedy and hers is drama - and that really showed in this movie. They never seemed quite in synch or both comfortable at once. Kutcher was better in the first half, when they were in their 'no strings attached' sex phase, and the movie was standard semi-raunchy rom-com fare. Portman was better in the second half, when they broke up, and had to do some soul-searching to decide what they wanted from each other. The writing was just so-so, as were the requisite surrounding comedy-relief 'friends.' So overall, an OK watch, but not great."
1,I Wish I Could Rate It Negative Stars,"I'm a fan of romantic comedies. This is neither. This movie isn't just an insult to the American people, it's the reason that I drink."
4,It's Alright,It's A Movie Worth Seeing At Least Once. It Has Nice Humor And The Actors Do A Good Job Performing. I Got For Like $5 So I Say Buy It.
1,bad writing,"This movie was a waste of time. First of all, I think Natalie Portman did a crappy job of acting in this...but it may not have been all her fault, since the writing was crappy too. It was totally unbelievable and at the same time totally predictable. I think it could have been a great story if it had a more gradual middle script...I just think it unbelievalbe for Natalie's charactor to change that much. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone...."
1,About what I expected,"but I started to watch it anyway. Note ""started"" - then I turned it off. I have to add a word."
1,If you are into porn...,"I knew there would be off color stuff but not like this. I was hoping for a cute fun comedy not a manual in color on different ways to do it , times and partners. The conclusion of the movie was satisfing but the off color jokes and gay activity was uncalled for and tasteless. It was a waste of my life and I regret having had seen it! Poor taste."
3,Good if you are not too selective,"Nice, light, easy to watch. I was looking for some fresh movie with not too much of over thinking and this one was perfect. I got relax of the mess of my weekend on a nice Sunday afternoon with it."
1,Poor Quality,Very little plot in this movie. Some great actors that are portrayed in lesser roles. Wouldn't suggest watching. Two more words.
3,Unfulfilling,"When I watch a rom-com, I understand that I'm watching it for those feel good, romantic moments. However, the writing in this was sub par even for a rom-com. The dialogue was cliche and uninspired throughout the entirety of the film, which made it hard to find any of it believable."
2,So bad,"This was so surface and so poorly acted that I lost interest in the first 20 minutes. I usually like Natalie Portman, but this was a really bad fit for her."
2,No Strings Attached Review - Just okay,"As chick flicks go this movie is okay, but it's not a stand out. It has it's funny moments, but it's completely predicable. Save your money and just watch it on Netflix."
3,No Strings Attached,"I thought the movie was ok, but found the story line a little difficult to follow. I think we all know where this movie was heading, and I was looking forward to seeing how it got there. I wouldn`t recommend it as a guide!Apart from this movie, I received this package from Amazon some 5 days before they told me it should arrive, so thanks Amazon, well done!"
3,Natalie Portman,"Probably this is the movie where Natalie Portman looks most beautiful. Simply, she is amazingly beautiful. About the movie, nothing really special."
4,Cute,"It was a cute movie, laughed out lous several times. I enjoy Natalie Portman. It was nice to see a movie where the roles were reversed."
2,"BORING, PREDICTABLE",THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL. VERY BORING MOVIE THAT IS EXCRUCIATINGLY PREDICTABLE. I COULD NOT WATCH THE ENTIRE MOVIE. PORTMAN'S ACTING COULD NOT SAVE THIS TRASH. THE OTHER ACTORS CLEARLY DISPLAYED THEIR SHAME TO BE IN A MOVIE THAT IS NOTHING MORE THAN A PAY CHECK FOR THEM.
1,"Bad writing, acting, plot",This movie was bad all around. Watched it with my wife and she fell asleep during it at left. At thispoint I felt safe turning it off.
5,I love this movie,"When I first saw this movie, I laughed a lot, out loud. I love the supporting cast! They really stood out in my mind. No surprise that my favorites now have their own tv shows. I also love Natalie Portman. I can watch this over and over."
3,Good romantic comedy,I thought this was a good romantic comedy. Perhaps even a 3.5 star. I will probably watch it again if it is still on prime videos.
4,Cute,"Cute movie, though not very deep. Decent for background noise as you can tune in at any point and know exactly what's going on."
4,Wonderful Exotic Setting,"I loved this book for the glamorous exotic setting of Victorian Egypt. The hero is extremely sexy and manly, and the whole tale is just very mysterious and glamorous. One of the best of the year!"
3,Gaah! I remember this book!,"I've been spending time looking for childhood memories, and one of the many memories that stood out to me was the cover of this book. Did anybody else realize that what Karen has is a MULLET? Totally unhelpful review, but that poor girl was given a mullet. Now THAT IS traumatic! Heh heh. :)"
5,Sky Zone LS-2423 humidifier/aromatherapy diffuser,"Love it, it is very relaxing to listen to while I meditate or am simply relaxing and reading. Wonderful product, has a variety of color and speed settings to choose from, and the subtle pastel colors look beautiful in the dark. Great to use with my essential oils too. Highly recommend this!"
1,Not what I expected !,"I've chosen this book expecting a comprehensive review of love and marriage under jewish lenses. Unfortunately the book is skewed to very radical views of the world and sound like literature from three centuries ago.When the author says a jew should abandon his son in the case he was produced outside formal wedding locks I decided to abandon reading. Judaism for me is about being the best you can as a human being and abandoning a child is only fit to a monster, whatever the circunstances he or she is born.If I could I would ""unread"" all this. We, as Jews, went down one notch in my view after reading this unfortunate production."
4,Imagination builder,"I purchased this toy for my 6 year old grandson who really likes it. He has other figures so this was an addition to his collection with which he likes to imagine that ""good guys"" are fighting ""bad guys"". Ibelieve this one is a good guy."
2,THE GREAT R&R SWINDLE !!!!!,"Compilation of live ARCHIVE footage (and this should be stated on the box) from this legendary brit HC band. The first 13 tracks are earlier OK material (81-93), good music, reasonably well sounding with a tolerable picture. The rest of the songs are latest, apalling material, and paradoxically the sound and picture gets worser the more contemporary the material gets, mostly recorded with just one camera, air mic, and a lot of b&white material !!!!. I love this band but I wouldn't have even borrowed this dvd from a friend had I been able to preview it, let alone spent good money on it !! Avoid it even if you're a Disorder hardcore fan/completist !!!"
1,Fictional,A piece of trash. Considering a man valued by Mao yet betrayed him here cannot be trusted in the first place.
4,Interesting Insights,"I enjoyed the insider's perspective that Dr. Li offers.The book spans Dr. Li's long career with Chairman Mao and includes a very good sections on the origins of Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.I enjoyed the insights into Mao's character--revealed by the way he lived his personal life and ran his empire.Strengths: A unique perspective, many accounts which are unavailable elsewhere; Terrific accounts of the backroom dealings and intrigue; Generally easy to read; The author does a good job of reintroducing the many characters in the book through the years.Weaknesses: It could have been pared down to a smaller size with little loss of impact.**Recommended: The New Emperors: China in the Era of Mao and Deng by Harrison Salisbury*Not recommended: The Boxer Rebellion by Diana Preston"
4,a classic,"Li's classic account of his life as Mao's personal physician will undoubtedly live. The title is a bit misleading, as this book is not merely aimed to ""entertain"" us with the shocking details of Mao's private life. Above all it's an autobiography, of a very honest and courageous man (a type that is increasingly rare in China or anywhere else), of his struggle to keep his conscience and humanity alive in perhaps one of the most calamitous periods of human history. Despite a life of suffering, and perhaps because of it, Dr. Li firmly believes that the truth will set us free. Now even today Mao's immense shadow has not dissipated. This book is banned and--paradoxically--bitterly attacked by all the moral cowards the Chinese government can muster. The degree to which a work is attacked and the author is defamed, in a country like China, can only show the greatness of both. History, finally, will reveal reason and truth"
3,No fence-sitting,As an off and on student of modern Chinese History and with a decided leaning toward the benefits of socalism for China I was bewildered by Li Zhisui's book. It seems to me that this is either an elaboratly deceptive historical piece or -- very close to reality.
3,"Interesting, but over rated!","I have not yet finished reading this rather interesting account by Chairman Mao's doctor. Though it is interesting it is rather one sided, and rather biased in the narrative. The previous reviews rave about it. Well I think that though this book will help you to understand modern China, Chairman Mao and the Chinese people, but it is over rated good , but not that brilliant or wonderful. Read other books about Mao, such as Philip Short's Mao a life and the unknown Mao by Jiang Chang to get a deeper and more balanced perspective."
1,I strongly doubt this book,"This book is said to be a translation from Chinese which was written by Dr. Li. However, after one reads the Chinese version, he will find that Chinese version is a direct translation of this English book and it is certainly not a book that a Chinese writer would write (style, terms, grammer, ..., in a short, all). So, I would say that I simply will not believe this book before I can read a true original Chinese version of the book."
4,A amazing tale,"I have no basis for judging the accuracy of the story; but, this book was the one that inspired me to learn more about Chinese history. The book taught me about the true horror of the Great Leap Forward and evil of Mao. If even half the book is true, it was worth the read. The book has a definite bias. Fans of Mao and communism will not like it. The author also tends to find excuses for his own actions. It is an excellent read for those that know little about the Mao era."
5,All the more horrifying because it is true.,There is really not much I can say about this book other than it is the best. If you are going to read only one book on modern China-- this is the book you must read. But be warned: be prepard to your eyes opened.
2,This is a great read,"I read this book 15 years ago, it was incredibly interesting and wanted to give a copy to my father for Christmas as I know he will enjoy it. I chose a ""Used- Like New"" book, having, in the past, been perfectly happy with this option. This book, while it has no markings or dog-eared pages, looks like it is 15 years old. The pages are yellowed and the cover looks worn. While I am sure my father will still enjoy it, I don't think it'll be going in his stocking!"
5,Fascinating Account of a 20th Century Dictator,This wonderful book gives the reader an inside look into the private life of Mao. It is almost like being a fly on the wall so to speak. Some of the accounts are humerous such as the scene with Mao's bodyguards trying to talk the chairman out of trying to swim the Yangtze River. The reader also learns that Mao did not believe in Chinese medicine much less Western medicine. The book is very detailed but hard to put down as Dr. Li chronicles the political struggles within Mao's inner circle. This is the definitive book on the private life of a dictator.
4,Mao's Famine - the worst in history,"Two recent books on the world's worst famine under Mao - about 30 million deaths - are Jasper Becker, Hungry Ghosts (Holt); and Dali Yang, Calamity and Reform in China (Stanford). Both are well worth reading. Becker is more viseral and one-sided while Yang also argues that the famine was fundamental to China's post-Mao reforms."
5,"Engrossing, fascinating study on the life of a dictator.","This book is a tremendously fascinating look at the life of one of the 20th century's most powerful dictators. There is no more comprehensive look into the mind of Mao than in this book by his own personal physician. I'm not sure if I approve of having a doctor spill the personal, often medical secrets of his patient, but the book is very engaging, never-the-less.Even at so many hundred-odd pages, the book just flies by. Engrossing. I got a feel of what might have been going through Mao's head as he launched one disasterous campaign after another. Of what little regard he had for human life, and how many of his own comrades he was willing to sacrifice to retain power, for the sake of having power. Thoroughly revolting.Dr. Li provides the reader with a portrait of the leader that only someone as close to him could have. I highly recommend this book."
5,Great book,It is a rare account of Mao's life. I think the Chinese edition has more souls to offer than the translation one.
4,Good Cd-RW Disc,The Verbatim CD-RW is just your basic disc nothing new. Good deal though with the jewl case though.
1,Yoko Yow Ono,"You must buy this. It is absolutely the most unlistenable thing ever recorded. It sets new standards, even for Yoko.You must especially buy this if you are in military intellegance, or a hostage team. Play this over and over at your victims, and I GUARANTEE that they will crack! Like thin ice!It is magnificent in its power to hunch up the shoulders, and cause squinting, perspiration, and eventual palsey. Listening to this record is like having to go to the bathroom really bad in a big crowd with no facilities anywhere. It is like a steel mill on a hangover. Like a wood bit through your mastoid. You must own it !"
2,nicotine substitues are not the way to go.,Pacified my habit when i had them but did nothing to help me quit. I would not purchase this again.
4,My stepmom loved it!,I haven't seen this glass yet as I sent it across the states as a Christmas gift. My stepmom was thrilled and just loves it.
4,Review,"This book is wonderful for any Catholics wishing to rebel against their overpowering faith, so don't read it around any nuns or priests!"
4,Good job of tough idea,"Kreeft applies the Socratic method to Satre's existentialim and helps one untangle some of Satre's very difficult thinking. No walk in the park, but well worth the read!"
3,Not Kreeft's Best,"Sartre is the father of existentialism. Sartre's ideas follow from his atheism. He admits that if there is no god than there is no law giver and no absolute law. People are, therefor, free to choose their own values and people are the results of the choices they make. He does not prove that god does not exist but chooses to believe that there is no god.However, unlike Plato's Socrates's which relies on almost entirely on logic Kreeft's Socrates often relies on popular opinion and personal attacks."
2,May Come in a Delco Box but not OEM quality,"Comes in a Delco Box but isn't the same quality as the one from my local chevy dealer.The local dealer's cable has better swaged connectors a heavier cable and stainless spring.This Made in China version is not even comparable, don't expect it to last 100k like the Local OEM version.I have ordered many good quality Delco parts from Amazon, but this is not one of them."
2,Basic Documentary,"Good documentary from the standpoint of vintage WWII photos and film footage. However, the overall production was quite rudimentary and little perspective was given in terms of map locations and actual information of units and specific actions."
1,not worth the money,"This was not worth the money. Because it does not have a digital tuner I experienced "" station bleed"" on almost all stations to such a degree that I am not able to use it. Spend a bit more money and get a digital tuner."
3,Unwieldy Headbands,"The sound quality on this items was fantastic, however, the headbands did not fit my head so they kept slipping off. The adjustments on the headbands would not stay in place, so when I would start for a walk with the headset in place, it would slip down around my neck - I don't hear with my neck!Finally, one day the headset actually flew off my head, crashed onto the street and is now in 3 pieces. So much for that headset.This would have been a super product had the headbands for the headset been adjustable. I just can't imagine that only men with big heads purchase headset radios."
2,victor marchese: the undiscovered tenor,The CD is quite acceptable up to track 13. The man obviously had a very pleasant voice but just happened to be in the right place at the wrong time. The tracks on the CD after track 13 are very average and maybe Mr Marchese should have retired a lot earlier than he did.As far as the DVD goes i have only played part of it and if the rest is as bad as what I played it is not worth the money.
5,Exactly as advertised,"I was looking for an inexpensive copy to use to test out of a Georgia History class, and this book came very quickly at a great price!"
4,"Ducks PearSox Hockey Socks...good quality, good buy","Good quality, worn them 5 times and no signs of tears, I would strongly recommend buying a pair."
4,Samsonite Widesize Messenger (Discontinued Model) Black,Good item. Would have liked it to have the expandable option where you can make it larger if you wanted to. It is also a little smaller than I would like and I fear that the strap will break if I put too much stuff in it all the time but when there is not that much in it is is good. I would have also liked a little bit longer strap because it is not quite long enough.
3,Expect the expected,"TESTIMONY has 15 tracks (also available in a 16 track version with an uncredited bonus track) which consists of 4 interludes (tracks 1, 7, 12, 14) and 11 (or 12) songs. The songs include one remake, Don Henley's ""The Heart of the Matter"" (""Forgiveness / Forgiveness / Even if, Even if ...U don't Love Me anymore""). Bonnie Raitt plays guitar on ""I Choose"".India.Arie does testify on this album, but it is less preachy than her last (her second) album. It is also much more Country.At first ""I Am Not My Hair"" on this album sounded different than the video version; but it is the same - it has the scratches and the verses by Akon, it only seemed more acoustic. The video just makes the song seem more urgent.The booklet contains no lyrics (but does have an essay written to her ""Dear Listeners"" and an extensive ""Thank you"" section). Also, the track times on the back of the CD are incorrect."
5,Vol 1,I think this was one of the best CDs she has made. This CD has helped me become a stronger person and has helped me get through many situations that I was going through. I Love This CD! I think God used her to help me through with this CD
4,Good Job,"I love India, in a world of fake boobs, fake extensions, fake butts, lips etc....and blond everything..comes a woman not bumping and grinding and stripping to distract from the fact there is no talent. India's acoustic style shows shes the real thing, the voice, the words, the sentiment, the presentation are all real. Listening to India is like sitting out on the beach on a sunny, breezy day enjoying a cool drink. No matter how heavy the lyrics she brings it out with such style and grace and wisdom that you feel that you are in the presence of a wise older woman. Kudos to India."
5,Soundtrack of my life,"India has done it again! She's created an album that hits so close to home in many areas of my life, from recent breakups to self love and disicovery. She always seems to offer up something pure, something divine, and some damn good music. There is no question that true music listeners should buy this album. Go 'head...give Amazon your money and rush deliver this CD because it is that good. Thank you India for being true to yourself, your music, and ultimately your listeners. Keep doing what you do. Be inspired!"
4,WOW,"Though India's second CD is my favorite, Testimony has a high quality sound and tells a wonderful story of love gained and love lost. I am a big India fan and anyone who enjoys her style will enjoy this CD."
4,GREAT ALBUM!!! BUY IT!!! YOU WON'T REGRET YOUR PURCHASE!!!,All I can say is this is a great album. It's an album that makes you feel good inside. GREAT ALBUM!!!
5,Truly a message....,"I write this for everyone who has not heard the album. Rarely is there ever an album that inspires me. I will say that this album/project has lifted my soul, my spirits, my heart. It was as if she were writing the words I am living. This compilation reflects the inner workings of a person's soul. May you find in this album true healing. Don't listen with your ears, listen with your heart. Congratulations India for I have learned love translates into every language their is, and transcends time and space. Continue your work girl...it is need.LIVE LOVE..."
5,Smart Sexy and Gifted,"My top 3 female artist are Erykah Badu,Jill Scott and now India Aire these 3 female artist in my opinion represent all of what we call soul music. Before this purchase i had heard very little of India's music. I have her latest Cd and its all to the good.This Cd doesn't have a weak track on it,India does what few artist are able to she inspires and entertains.Her messages are strong but not preachy or overbearing and yes very needed.Sometimes i read reviews of recordings and I have come to the conclusion that it all comes down to what you like.Listen to the samples and judge for yourself i give her 5 stars for this effort and look forward to adding more of her music to my library. If you appreciate an artist who is smart,sexy and gifted and able to make music fun to listen to holla at my girl,peace"
5,Inspirational songs,I love this cd. All the songs seems like they are talking to me. I really enjoyed this cd.
3,typos,"This is a review of the sample page, which misspells ""bootstrap"" as ""bootstap"" and does not predispose me to buy the book!"
3,Gracelin's Change,"Gracelin arrived in San Francisco to marry Captain Reinders, who was not there. Gracelin finds a hospital for Mary Kate who has become ill. Here she meets Dr. Wakefield who helps change her life forever. Ann Moore gives her readers a happy ending to Gracelin's troubled life. Read and find out how Gracelin's story is played out in this final book about her. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
5,Best trilogy I have ever read.,"I love these books! Having Irish ancestry, I found the history surrounding the story must interesting.. The Irish suffered so much during the potato famine and were treated so badly by the British. When they arrived in America they had a very difficult time of it. Books to be read over and over."
3,not great but barable,I do not own this track my friend does and i listened to it.I love lilbowwow i preety much grow into his music even when at first i dont like it.This wasnt the best i find the cover very cute but the actualy music i just wasnt feelin it.If its your favorite song go buy it!.I think its overpriced also go buy the whole cd for the same price.If you havent bought lilbowwows cd doggy bag please do it is preety good much difrent then his first i dont regret buying it.All in all it really wasnt that great(thats my name)
5,Mickey Mouse DVD,My Grandchildren wanted this new DVD of Mickey Mouse and just love it. Right now it is their favorite they are 2 1/2 and 6. Good selection if your children are into Disney and Mickey Mouse.
2,wasn't what I thought,Don't get me wrong I love Mickey and all his friends but something about this movie just drove me bonkers. I being an Alice in Wonderland fanatic bought it hoping it would be something I would love to watch again and again. Maybe it's because I'm not 4? I just didn't like it that much and I don't think I will ever watch it again. Once was definitely enough for me.
4,My 3 yr old loves it!,"My son is a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse fanatic. He loves everything Mickey, and we own most of the Clubhouse DVDs. I like this one because it is a longer feature unlike most of the other DVDs which contain 3 or 4 of the regular episodes you can find on the Disney Channel. I wish it had stuck closer to the Wonderland storyline, but I suppose that would be more for me than for my son. If your child likes Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, I am sure they will enjoy this movie."
5,My 2 1/2 year old asks for this DVD over all her other Mickey DVDs.,"This DVD is great and worth every penny. If you let it play through fast play there is even a bonus Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episode that will play automatically. It's good for long car rides. The cuckoo bird is so cute my daughter started saying ""cuckoo bird"" and also sings along with Mickey and Donald."
5,Entertaining and Educational,"My 2-year old niece loves this DVD. She knows the words by heart and HAS to watch it every time she visits (which is a lot). Of all the Clubhouse DVD's I think this one is the most educational because it teaches time, shapes, numbers, and size, and social skills, as well as patience. The DVD does not go into these subjects deeply but are age appropriate for the intended audience.Now if I could just get the songs ""I'm Goofy hatter"", ""I'm the professor yes I am"", and ""Tick Tock, Tick Tock it's time to fix the coo coo clock"" out of my head I'd be happy!"
1,terrible,this disc wont even play and its all scratched....my daughter was so excited when it finally came and now she cant even watch...tried contacting the seller and so far nothing........extremely disappointed
3,Pretty good,"So I am a huge Chocolate Peanut Butter freak, and have been looking for a peanut butter cup cocoa for a while. I finally broke down and ordered this after a few months hemming and hawwing about it. Now I aadmit to not reading the directions the first cup and at first was like wow slightly chocolate water and added a few more spoonfuls of the mix to my cup and it improved but was not quite what i expected and this was made with water(I was at work and had little choice) The next day I deceided to try it again at home in my hot cocoa machine with milk and there was a GREAT improvement!! So as a result I'm going to try an experiment tonight and make a shake in the blender with the mix!!! I said im a peanut butter cup freak!!!"
5,Love it! Hard to find this at the grocery store,"I've tried them all and keep coming back to the Belgian chocolate. A chocoholic's dream. I drink this every morning and this seem's to be the most economical way to buy it, 6 cans at a time."
5,The best hot chocolate,This is my family's favorite hot cocoa brand. The kids favorite flavor if mint chocolate.
1,Horrible,"I ordered the No Sugar Added version. I usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream, yogurt, hot chocolate etc. But this one was terrible. Like the other reviewer, this tasted like ovaltine. I had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. I don't know what to do with 5 other cans.. I will probably donate.."
5,"Stephen's Gourmet Hot Cocoa, Cherry Chocolate, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)","This is absolutely delicious. Because it is in powder form, you can make it as strong or weak as your taste buds allow. I add instant Folger's to mine, making it into a mocha. That also cuts the sweetness. It really DOES taste like chocolate covered cherries -- a treat I have loved since childhood!I get mine through the ""subscription program"" along with several other flavors from Stephen's. The subscription program works well for me since I travel. You can change the frequency AND the address to which it is to be sent as needed."
3,So so,"This is an OK hot cocoa. I had been using Land O'Lakes product, but wanted to try this for a change. The taste is comparable, but the portions in each packet is smaller. I still like Land O'Lakes hot cocoa better."
3,Whats the hype over?,Its good Hot Cocoa but not anything worth the cost of this. I think its a huge Utah cultural thing; like In-N-Out is a huge California thing. I will say that its great and fun to try it and then move on if your not absolutely sold on it.
5,Great tasting hot chocolate,I love Stephen's Gourmet Hot chocolate. It arrived quickly and we have been enjoying it for at least a month now.
5,Very tasty - maybe a little too rich if making with milk,"I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out). I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good. The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time). My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it."
1,Disappointed,"I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale. Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine. For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes. For my part I won't be ordering this again. UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that. It was delicious. I can't explain the difference but I'd recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows."
4,Yumm!,This was a great gift for friends and co-workers. One can never go wrong with such a tasty gift .
3,Great tasting but unhealthy.,This product contains partially hydrogenated oils which is very detrimental to your health. I would rather pay more for a product which does not contain transfats.
2,Not a gourmet product,"I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake. This is half a step above Swiss Miss. It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase."
4,Hot Cocoa,I like the taste of chocolate and mint. It mixed well when I added Hot water. Next I might try a warm milk.
2,Has Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil,"Unfortunately I didn't notice this until I received the product. I guess I'll be giving it away to friends & family that don't mind it.Tastes artificial like coffee creamer.IngredientsSugar, Sweet Whey, Maltodextrin, Partially Hydrogenated Coconut Oil, Cocoa (Processed With Alkali), Corn Syrup Solids, Non-fat Dry Milk, Natural & Artificial Flavor, Sodium Caseinate (A Milk Derivative), Salt, Mono and Diglycerides, Dipotassium Phosphate, Carrageenan, Soy Lecithin."
4,ok cdrw,good price...good quality...definitely worthwhile if you are not sure whether you want to buy this brand but if u know a brand that works well buy in bulk
3,Distracting Format,"You'll want to see this movie if you've seen the new Scorcese film. This one delivers great interviews with people close to Hughes, and fills your need for more background of this unusual life.However, the producers have adopted some really hard-to-take conceits in presenting their material:1. A really bogus ""first person narration"" device by some guy with a fake Texas accent. The writing of this narrative line is stilted, hackneyed and takes away from good content.2. Overuse of a musical track. I used to like the song they used until they ran it into the ground.3. ""Dancing stills."" The producers watched way too many Ken Burns documentaries.The material itself is strong; Hughes' life story is dramatic enough. The excesses and melodrama used here take away from a real underlying story..."
2,Fabulous footage; lousy presentation,"On balance, a downer. With all this material, fantastic film footage from Hughes' heyday, it was very disappointing to listen to the fake ""autobiographical"" memoirs, which were both imaginary and poorly imagined. Besides being delivered in a voice and manner which in no way appeared to match the features, character or speech of the real man. The film, and the accompanying bits and pieces, are still interesting in spite of this, but one was constantly aware of how very much better the whole treatment could have been. There has to be a much better and more genuinely understanding account of Hughes' life out there somewhere. What does come across is that Hughes was a very likeable man, who came to an extremely tragic end."
3,Out Like Flynn,"Errol Flynn's final swashbuckler is colorful, fast-paced escapism - familiar stuff yet nicely done in CinemaScope. ""The Warriors"" (1955) offers plenty of action, a distinguished British cast and Henry Levin's vigorous direction. Flynn looks older than his 46 years, but delivers a spirited performance. Shown as ""The Dark Avenger"" in Europe, ""The Warriors"" deserves a widescreen DVD release."
4,"It's a yolk, son","To avoid any confusion, you must understand this is a ""joke"" book. I didn't realize this when I bought it. It is perfect a gag gift for someone's fiftieth birthday party, along with those black balloons!"
5,OWN THIS MACHINE 2 YEARS * * * * * 5 STARS,"1) Quiet2) Quiet3) Did I mention it's quiet?4) Drips water from rear constantly - Which is VERY GOOD, takes immense amount of moisture out of the air!5) Nice air circulation controls.6) Q U I E T !!!!!"
2,not very good,"No wonder it was so cheap, it is a cheap ball. It never really held air and after once practice it was already lopsided."
2,Mine was defective,"The ball we received wouldn't hold air for more than a few hours, so we returned it. Otherwise it seemed ok. The panels are stitched together, so it has a real soccer ball style and weight -- not just a rubber playground ball with a soccer ball print. The synthetic leather is very slick and plastic feeling, just an aesthetic issue. If it had held air we would have kept it and been satisfied."
2,2 stars for price,"The price is cheap, and if this is for a child who doesn't kick very hard, it's a great deal. If, however, you're an adult, pay more to get one that lasts longer. The stitching on this is already ripped and coming apart and I've only used it for about a week."
5,"Great diaper bag toy, very good quality.","This is a very high quality wooden play book. It is designed to be simple. Your child can place the snail into a hole on each scene on the wooden pages. The snail is secured by a string, so there's no burden of having to keep track of where the snail has gone off to. Great for very young children to develop basic skills.My son is only 22 mo. old, so I like to sit with him and let him practice putting the snail where he would like and then we tell stories of the snail's adventures from page to page, scene to scene. My son is a bit young to keep his attention for long, but it's well worth the time he does spend using his imagination and coordination skills. We also own and enjoy the frog version of this book.It is a wonderful quiet play book as well, so it's perfect for sitting through church services or waiting at the Dr.'s office. It is a perfect size to fit nicely in the diaper bag or even my purse."
3,not the original,"When I looked for the title ""New York New York"", there was supposed to have been the original cd with New York City at night on the label. At the time I looked it up, it did not show the picture, so I had no idea this was not was I was looking for. I was disappointed that some of my favorites from Franky are played by the Orchestra's..but overall, the other two cd's that come in this set are not bad at all, just doesn't have the songs that are my favorites sung from Sinatra. It's my favorite music I play at work...."
4,Nice....includes the corn maiden...,Nice....includes the corn maiden...Native American Tarot Deck (Religion and Spirituality)...a nice spin on this entertainment deck or cards!~arrived quickly bought as a gift for a friend!~
2,"I was wrong, because I do not know how does it works.","The situation that I have is having a Nokia 2330 Classic, but did not know that this model does not included connectivity. Any way, thanks. SDoctor."
1,Avoid this one...,"Hard to use, sub-standard software. Difficult to set-up a link. Make your life easier, and just go for a USB cable link between your phone and your computer. In the time it takes to establish a Bluetooth link using this inferior product, you could be done uploading and downloading info between your phone and computer using a cable.Better software is available free on the internet."
2,Boxwood Pins,Disappointing. These fit only those guitars with string ramps since the slots do not extend into the collar. They look good so I may modify them to fit.
5,universal patterns,"I used this book throughout my degree which was in art and maths. It was superb and very easy to read or just scan through. I would recommend it to anybody interested in these subjects, especially people who are facinated with the links between maths and art. Well worth getting."
1,"Noisy, doesn't work, uses a lot of electricity","An ugly house appliance that's also noisy and simply doesn't work. I've never seen as bad a product as this one. We left it on for 48 hours and the basement was still humid, and it was a nice, cool weekend. Back it goes. Do not fall for this low-quality brand."
1,"Big, noisy, doesn't quite work","The title pretty much sums up this clumsy dehumidifier from Koraen company Gold Star. It's cheap, and works like it. 'Cause it doesn't really get rid of humid air in your room. And it's very noisy. If you need a quality dehumidifier, do not get this. I recommend you go into a store and ask them to turn each humidifier for sale on ""high"" to see if you can stand their noise."
5,Mentor text for opinion writing,This text is great as a mentor text for First Grade opinion/argument writing. The students enjoy the little girls pleas to her parents to allow her to get earrings. It is a great example to show students that even though they may have good arguments they don't always get what they want.
4,"This collection is nearly ""Heaven"".","I'd call this the perfect time for a Live hits album, and if ever there was a disc of theirs to top ""Throwing Copper"", this is it. ""Awake"" is great because it includes 19 tracks, in chronological order, and of course for the wonderful music. Everything is included from ""Pain Lies On The Riverside"", ""Lightning Crashes"", ""Lakini's Juice"", ""Dolphin's Cry"", and ""Overcome"". Plus the cover of ""I Walk The Line"", and the unreleased track ""We Deal In Dreams"", both very good. The only song I really miss is ""Freaks"". Overall it's a great collection from one of the better bands of the past 10-15 years, and this version with a disc of videos is a must for fanatics."
4,Great addicting compilation,"Although a few tracks are missing from this collection (MIRROR SONG, WATERBOY, and IRIS), I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to revive LIVE in their playlists. Lightning Crashes will always be their best track, but there are many other good tracks on this compilation. Most people avoid purchasing a greatest hits because the have the individual albums, but there are some new and unreleased tracks on here that are excellent and worth the purchase alone. I wish there were half stars, I'd give it 4.5Go for it!"
3,Live or not?,"So is this a live album or a studio album? The ""[LIVE]"" suffix on the title is way confusing. If it's a studio compilation, I'm buying it."
5,The Transcendent Message of LIVE,"A compilation with a message to your Higher Self. How may rock bands speak about raising Consciousness through the power of Love? It may sound like an old, worn-out 60s philosophy, but if you really look at the lyrics and find the common threads among the songs, you'll find mythical symbolism and metaphor that speaks of something greater that connects all of us, both to ourselves and each other. Look beyond the surface story of the songs. The Sun, the One, the Water, the Illusion of our separateness (Maya), to name only a few - it's all right there, hidden in plain sight - like messages in any great works of art speaking to our subconscious. With the power of the internet at hand, anyone can do a search on any of the above and begin to see a much deeper message coming from these guys. Just open your mind and your heart: ""the perception that divides you from him, is a lie. For some reason, we never ask why."""
4,GREAT HITS COLLECTION FROM AN UNDERRATED BAND: 4.5 STARS,"LIVE IS AN AMAZING BAND. WHEN WILL THE PUNKS DOWN AT MTV EVER LEARN THIS? ALL OF THE SONGS COMPILED ON THIS CD ARE GOOD. THE TRACKS THAT STAND OUT THE MOST ARE ''I ALONE'', ''LIGHTNING CRASHES'', ''HEAVEN'', ''LAKINI'S JUICE'', AND LIVE'S COVER OF JOHNNY CASH'S ''I WALK THE LINE''. PEOPLE CALLED THIS BAND THE POOR MAN'S U2. I STRONGLY DISAGREE. LIVE, AS QUIET AS IT'S KEPT, REALLY PAVED THE WAY FOR ALTERNATIVE BANDS LIKE CREED, SWITCHFOOT, AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE BANDS LIKE THAT. FANS OF ROCK MUSIC SHOULD DEFINITELY BEGIN TO GET INTO THIS BAND BY STARTING WITH THIS CD. THERE'S ANOTHER VERSION OF THIS CD THAT COMES WITH A DVD OF THEIR MUSIC VIDEOS. IT MIGHT COST A LITTLE MORE, BUT IT MAKES THE EXPERIENCE EVEN BETTER."
5,Amazing artist,"I'll give this album a 5, I think its essential music for everyone. Emotional lyrics, great music, and this includes many of the best songs, though for someone just starting listening to Live, throwing copper may be the better choice."
4,From a great band comes a good greatest hits album,"I have loved live since Throwing Copper came out in the mid-90's.I then fell in love with their earlier album, Mental Jewlery.Both are great, and probably owning the pair give you Live's truely greatest hits.This album is basically all of the singles, more or less, that made it on radio.The only thing that I would have added was Iris from Throwing Copper. It is, in my opinion, Live's greatest song.But if you don't own any Live, own Throwing Copper first, then if you want to expand maybe get this album and then Mental Jewlery. The rest of their albums, I feel, is fairly represented in this Greatest Hits CD. Enjoy."
4,"This disc is nearly ""Heaven"".","I'd call this the perfect time for a Live hits album, and if ever there was a disc of theirs to top ""Throwing Copper"", this is it. ""Awake"" is great because it includes 19 tracks, and they're in chronological order, and of course for the music itself. Everything is here from ""Pain Lies On The Riverside"", ""Lightning Crashes"", ""Lakini's Juice"", ""Dolphin's Cry"", and ""Overcome"". Plus the cover of ""I Walk The Line"", and the unreleased track ""We Deal In Dreams"". The only song I miss is ""Freaks"". Overall it's a great collection from one of the better bands of the past 10-15 years."
5,Awesome!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this CD!! It hardly ever leaves my CD player. All of the songs are great, but some of my favorites are ""All Over You"", ""Lightning Crashes"", ""Turn My Head"", ""Dance With You"", ""Run to the Water"", and ""Dolphin's Cry"". ""Overcome"" is also really good. Actually, I might as well just name every single song on the album! Buy this and you will not be let down!"
4,"Quite a chore to read, but...","The book is of course too long, and there are stretches where it is dull, but there are many stretches herein with considerable interest. The Cloister and the Hearth, to which it has been compared, is a much better book. The same is true of The Three Musketeers. But the first part of the book is quite good, and the historical part involving Napoleon has its moments. But in general when Anthony gets to the USA the book becomes of less interest. The ending is long drawn out, and one reads just to see how it will come out. Hard to believe the book was the no. 1 bestseller in fiction in both 1933 and 1934. I wonder if anyone has ever read it twice. I certainly won't."
5,Best stools ever,"These bar stools are really great for the price. I love the way they swivel, really easy. I may just have to order two more for my bar..."
1,Samara,Be very careful about buying these chairs. We bought 4 of them. There is only one bolt and nut that holds the swivel top. After one week three of the swivel tops came apart.
2,Not worth the money,"This isn't what I had expected at all. All it is is the study guide with the answers typed in. Doesn't offer any outside teaching help or activities, etc. Wouldn't spend the money for it again."
3,For once I agree with Andy Gill.,"OK, the audio quality is as poor as some concerts I've attended, but the band's performance gets five stars. The brass are tight, George Duke and Napoleon Murphy Brock do some hilarious versions of early Mothers songs, and Frank has several outstanding solos. The great musicianship and inventive overhauls of early Mothers material (not duplicated elsewhere on other live recordings) make this worth hearing."
1,Save your money! Abyssmal sound quality!,"Virtually unlistenable, there are much better quality recordings of this era available. Try YCDTOSA #2 for size, it's phenomenal and sounds damn fine."
3,"quality bad, music good.","the quality on this cd is not very outstanding, being as it is some sort of a bottleg offered to the masses. but when i bought this, i had it in mind that the quality would not be phenominal (and as you listen on, you would think something is wrong with your speakers). but i think the music itself, along with the mothers funny attitude almost makes up for it. this one is for hard-core zappa fans."
1,Horrible recording!,"Avoid this release -- far and away, the worst of Zappa's Beat The Boots series -- as Zappa's great Mothers band is drowned out by this unlistenable recording, which sounds like it was made from the cheapest portable cassette recorder available at that time. To boot, some of the pitch goes off in several unlistenable directions.While the majority of Beat The Boots serves its purpose, all Unmitigated Audacity will make you do is want to seek a much better copy of any Zappa show around that time."
1,Does not work with Android Phones or Tablets,Bought this for the kindle version only. Turns out it does not work with ANY Android Smartphone or ANY Android Tablet. If you are a apple user or kindle tablet user it does work. There is a hidden pull down tab in the description that I missed when ordering. My first and last experience with anything kindle.
4,Just my opinion,"Well it's not boston but it does have a similar sound to Bostons Corprate America. The sound quality and mix is excellent. Some of these tracks are heavier than the material you have head from the cosmos before. Overall a great disc. Very 2006 and worth checking out. I listened to previews on thier myspace site and had to have it, I think if your reading this you will want it to."
3,70's and 80's type music,"Not a bad album by Fran and Anthony Cosmo, formerly with the rock band Boston. I like that style of music."
1,I wish I could give it zero stars...,DiGeronimo needs an education! No one has ever accused her of being a good writer. She needs a new profession...is anyone hiring?
5,"Beauty and function, well balanced","I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for my Sweetie last Christmas (2006). I chose it for it's stylish design and classic good looks. It was a good choice. He just loves this pen, says it's very comfortable to hold and writes smoothly with no skipping or blots of ink. In fact he likes it so much he refuses to take it to work, so that it won't grow legs and walk away when his back is turned. All of his other pens sit idle now as this is the only one he uses when at home.Although it looks very elegant, feels good in the hand, and writes smoothly, it's just too bad though that this pen has not improved his penmanship....."
5,A keyboard that would make the Energizer Bunny proud,"I have owned two of these keyboards for several years, use one at work, and have installed close to fifty of them in my work as a systems integrator. Every one of them is still in service and no problems have occurred to date, while cheapie keyboards need replacing every couple of years when installed in a 24/7/365 environment. With its lifetime warranty, if one ever does fail, it will be easy to have repaired or replaced.I whole-heartedly recommend the LT Designer keyboard."
5,De-frizz without being sticky,"Like a fine spray of a very light oil. It's the best de-frizzer I have found, and, unlike other de-frizzers, it is never sticky. Don't use too much, or your hair will look oily."
4,quality product and you can't beat the price!!,"I use Citre Shine Mist, Anti-Frizz Spray Laminator almost every day. It really makes a difference in the appearance of my hair. You only need 2 or 3 sprays and it makes your hair look so shiny an gorgeous; like you just came from the salon! Because you only need to use a couple sprays each time, the bottle lasts for a long time. My bottle isn't even half empty after using it daily for 2 months. You get a quality product for a low price. This is the perfect product to finish off your hair routine. It's not greasy AT ALL (unless you spray it an inch away from your roots) and definitely adds that extra ""oomph"" to your hair."
2,Issues with lighter,"The merchant was kind and exchanged the product for me, the second lighter had the same problem, it would not light. Subsequently at the tobacco store, they had printed instructions on the procedure to get it to work, this was eventually successful after the second atepmt. I also found out that their are a number of issues with this lighters. The Colibri Co. , also went out of business."
5,Great Introduction to the subject...comprehensive!,"As a collector of thrift store paintings, I was completely enthralled with this book! I couldn't put it down. I now look at my paintings with a new perspective. This book was able to validate many of my intuitive feelings about the creative process. Thank-you Colin Rhodes for this insightful look at some of the least understood of paintings!"
3,Not bad good for some tasks,"This is a pretty good product if you have LPs or other music sources you've encoded to MP3. I tried it for music I recorded off the radio onto my MP3 player.The problem with it is that it doesn't allow you to split tracks by selecting sections of it. So if you have a song, like some of Tori Amos' tunes, that have silent pauses during the track, the auto-splitter built into the program will break 1 song into multiple MP3 files. You can go back and join them together but that's a pain. If it gave you a visual mapping of the track so you could highlight sections you want, it would vastly improve the program.Other problem with it is you can't add the MP3 tags in the program. You have to save the MP3s and then add the Tags using MusicMatch or other player.So, not bad for tasks like recording LPs where you already know the start/stop times of the tracks. Not nearly sufficient for breaking mixes or large MP3s that you don't have the break time for songs for."
4,Awesome Knife,"A fantastic knife/multitool. My only disappointment is there is not a sheath included with it(at over $200.00 price tag), and trying to buy one has been almost impossible. Otherwise, I'm very satisfied with my purchase. GJM"
5,best knife,I bought this for a collectors item but once I saw the size in real life i was amazed i am a kid and it fit my hand well too turn for something like screwing a nail just use 2 hands those of you who think it is too big its not i also bought the swisschamp and i cut my self more with the swisschamp then i did with this knife BUY ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
1,Amazon shipped with lowe quality box!,"1 Star to Amazon.Amazon was very misleading when it uses the current image. It shows that the Victorinix XAVT comes with the attractive gift box that you see in the image. But in reality it came with an over-sized carton box stuffed with sponge! With this kind of box it is definitely not for collector! I have posted 2 images taken from my iPhone. Please go have a look.5 Stars to the Victorinox XAVT.This is the mother of all Swiss Army knives. Everything you found in other series you can find them here. Especially useful are Traveller functions like the altimeter, barometer, temperature gauge, etc. Now I only need to have one tool.Perhaps the duplication tools are for backup, just in case you broke any one of them."
4,"New Practical Chinese Reader Workbook, Vol. 1 (Chinese Edition)",I had ordered the workbook not the CD of the Workbook; which I already had. I received CD instead. Other than that the CDs arrived in great condition stilled sealed; never opened.
2,Not useful unless reading along in the book,"I thought that this product would be useful to help me brush up on Chinese while stuck in traffic; however, it's basically useless unless you are following along in the book. It really only works with the ""Practical Chinese Reader"" textbook. Driving while reading is NOT recommended."
2,Get ready to wait,"Product arrived 45 days later, don't order if you need it for a class. Product wasn't even what I expected, I expected to get the workbook...instead I got the CD's."
3,"Disappointing, and hardly worth the Nolo imprimatur","Gee whiz, this manual is the least helpful Nolo publication I've ever read. It pains me to say so but this one seems almost as if the entire thing was phoned in. It doesn't have the meaty, pithy, chewy bits that most Nolo publications have.I've just come up with a theory for this to wit, Nolo is finally running out of stuff to write about. Its (non)legal library is so big, by now, that it has simply plucked all of the ripe, low hanging fruit and is serving up green stuff.This guide reads like what one imagines a 'Dummy's Guide' or a Cliff's Notes book reads like, a broad, not particularly deep survey that briefly hits all the main points such that one can put them into a blue book essay and get a C+ grade.Even if you don't know anything about this topic, I suspect it is possible to find a different and better manual on the subject. I would look there.This one is genuinely mediocre."
2,nothing revealing here,"Very sturdy, works prefect, I would recomend, not sure why I have to use a minimum number of words though"
4,Complete Guide to buying a business - Steingold,"Good book so far. has pointed out many important points and nuance of the business purchase decision. I haven't finished the book yet but so far, I have found it helpful and a very good reference to point to more detailed search info."
3,"Not so ""Complete"" guide to buying a business","Overall not a bad book. Several good ideas and reminders. The forms on CD are very helpful. However, a book that touts itself as complete, shouldn't short-cut critical issues such as valuing or financing a business simply by referring the reader to another book, often by the same publisher. The chapter on valuing a business was an overview without specifics. The chapter on financing, again just an overview, didn't mention the process of using a self-directed IRA to finance a business purchase (you need a special asset custodian for your IRA, but it is legal)."
3,Not a replacement for a lawyer,"I've sold one small business in my life. I was clueless, but found very good support (lawyers) to help me along the way. This book would have been a good read before meeting with my team. It is worth the price asked. It'll be no surprise to anyone that this book doesn't replace a good lawyer(s), but the book is very good at preparing the seller or buyer for the transaction."
3,Good buy for the money...,"While not the most feature-rich air conditioner (there's nothing electronic whatsoever about the thermostat and fan controls), it certainly gets the job done for cheap.Cools a single room reasonably, and in multiples of 2 or 3, it can take on most entire apartments."
2,Not cooling after 1.5 years,"Was a good deal when I purchased the small window a/c, and cooled nicely for about 1.5 years. Now, it doesn't cool at all."
1,Horrible condition! Not even same ac unit! Looks like its been rolled down the stairs!,"the filter on the back looks like its been kicked, its not even the same as the one in the picture, it didnt even come with the seal strip like the manual says its supposed to have the ac that was sent is an (LG) not a (Goldstar) its not even understandable!"
4,Acanthus Press second place prize winner,"I own a number of the Acanthus Press series, as well as numerous other books on great estates and mansions, some more than 100 years old. So I'm a tough critic. I agree with the other reviewers that this is a very good volume and in my opinion second only to the House of Los Angeles ( two volumes) set. The author has published many of the period photos in full page format. But what I would have liked in this book was more homes. There are a number of well photographed equally grand and important mansions that are missing. The jaw dropping Yerkes mansion for one was extensively photographed at the time. I am pleased however that the author did include the wonderfully gaudy Clark mansion, heretofore overlooked in other books on this subject.This volume definitely should be part of your collection.4.5 stars."
2,Hello lame song...,When this song falls off the the TRL (Total Request Live) charts on MTV I am having a party. Almost as bad as N'Sync and Backstreet Boys.
5,I think that Britney Spears is the best singer on earth .,"I love Britney Spears and I am a singer too I sing in every single restaurant I go to I live in America for 2 Years,I com from Russia."
1,I really like Britneys Pears,"Her music is absolute garbage and shallow, good for teeny boppers and people with no interest in real music. But she's a good strong lass with a lot going for her.When she jumps about mimeing her songs on stage you see a really fit, finely honed athelete with everything in the write place. Yes maybe there aint much between her ears, but she's a real visual treat to my eyes."
1,Nothing but problems,I bought this to listen to my music at work(contractor)Poor sound and uses up 8 D batteries quickly !Battery door doesn`t close properly.One speaker cuts out from time to time.If I need another(which I already feel I do).......I`d look at a different make.Sorry........but I was prompted to give the reviewand they wouldn`t post it without giving at least one star......I would give it NO stars !R.K.
1,Terrible unit,It sounded horrible and the tape player broke within 3 days. Don't buy it. It looks cool but sounds like a loud pair of headphones.
1,Purchase a Different Unit,"Like others have said, you get what you pay for. Bought this device specifically for cassette tape playback from audio books. Used approximately 8 hours during the 107 days I've owned it. Tape player has already crapped out. Sent emails to CobyUSA tech support AND customer support and NEVER heard from either. I suggest you perhaps spend more and get a better product FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER."
3,No cord,How do you sell a boombox without the electrical cord. Should of read the other customer comments before buying this.
5,Love it,My husband loves his player especially because it does cassettes and cds - it was hard finding one to do both
3,return product,I would liked to have known about the shipping costs for returning this item before I bought it. The CD player & radio worked fine but the cassette player did not work. Coby requires you to pay to ship it back to them and also send them a money order for them to send it back to you. I don't think the customer should have to pay to return a defective procduct. I am handicapped and getting a money order will present a problem. They could at least accept a check or credit csrd. To me this seems like insult to injury.
3,"Coby CX-CD248 Portable boombox with CD player, etc.","Good product for the reasonable price; after putting in the batteries found out, that you are not supposed to leave them in when not using this way."
1,COBY,"cassettes, cd's and radio worked when received. Second time played a CD and it FAILED in the middle of the CD. Unit needs more bass.Sound is high treble and tinny."
3,Very disappointed,"I bought this item for my baby grandaughter's room so my daughter could play CDs and cassettes at night when she went to bed. The CD player never worked and now I can send it back but I have to pay for shipping both ways which is going to be about $15.00 because the company doesn't reimburse you for shipping. I am very disappointed and even if I did send it back, there may be a good chance of it happening again. The product is very tinny and not good sound quality . I will not be buying from this company again. I will sell this at a yard sale. JUNK!!"
2,At least the CD player works,The reason we bought it was for the tape recorder/player. Unfortunately that part doesn't function properly.
2,do not waste your money!,"this is not a terribly made product, however it was supposed to come with an a.c. power cord & mine did not have it in the box. it was also sloppily packaged & looked like it had been opened in the factory or something & then thrown in the shipping box, without bothering to close it back. since it was opened i don't know if someone took the power cord out in the factory or what. i got it for my 4 year old son for Xmas & unfortunately when it came i grabbed it out of the cardboard shipping box & put it away without checking inside the original package. if i had i would've noticed the missing cord so i only just discovered it was missing & i can't get my money back."
5,Great!,"Great price, easy to poerate. Great sound and works like a charm! I have had no problems what-so-ever out of this product and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
4,Love it!,I love this boom box!You can listen to CD's or cassette tapes or the radio.It has a power cord soyou don't have to buy batteries!
2,"inexpensive, but you get what you pay for","I ended up having a lot of trouble with skipping when using this boombox, especially when using burnt CDs. It also lacks a lot of features such as bass boost or a programmable play sequence. The sound is mediocre, but adequate. I'd recommend spending an extra $10-$20 and getting a better model."
3,The cord is in the battery compartment.,The other reviews indicate that the cord is not with the boombox. I called the company and they tell me it is in the battery compartment.
1,Does not last...,"CD player stopped working after two months of ownership, it was playing a cd and puff, that was her last one. Also, very troubling for me: I left the powercord at my sister's house and could not find a replacement at any of the usual shops; it takes a special fitted powercord. The radio receiver is also weak, it changes depending on where I sit or walk in the room."
1,Read the other reviews first!,"Unfortunately, I was looking at the price when I bought this and didn't read the reviews here at amazon. Big mistake! My experience with this product has been what many others here are reporting: It breaks quickly (mine broke the 2nd day!) and starts skipping or stops playing music altogether (sometimes, if I don't turn it off when it does this, it will resume playing later, at some random time). Basically, it doesn't work. This ended up being a waste of money for me!"
3,Boombox by Coby,"Nice product for the price, but I would have liked it to have had a base boom and to be programable."
3,"Adequate, not great","I bought this to have a battery operated CD player for when the power goes out, which seems to happen with increased frequency in these deferred maintenance times. The CD player and tape player are good, the radio not so much. Very poor reception in this area - can't even pick up the local station."
4,PORTABLE CD/CASSETTE PLAYER w/AM/FM RADIO,This is perfect for a preteen or teenager. But sound could be improved a little and dialing in the stations are harder than another form of scanning the spectrum of AM/FM radio.This is what our granddaughter asked for but we probably would have bought something else if we'd gone looking.She's happy so it really doesn't matter what we think is right .
1,I wouldn't buy another.,"I had trouble with two of these. Either the CD player or the cassette player malfunctioned. On another I gave as a gift, the cassette door didn't close properly."
1,Coby CX-CD248 Boombox,"I ordered this for my father. The instructions they provide are lousy. There is not explanation of how to operate the thing. He can't get the cassette player to work but doesn't feel it is worth the time, trouble, or money to return it. Would not recommend this to anyone.Coby CX-CD248 Portable Boombox with CD Player, Cassette Deck, and AM/FM Tuner"
2,lacking quality,Good sound but poor quality. Antenna broke off the first time I used the radio and the cd player lid only opens a few inches making it hard to load a cd without scratching it.
1,piece of junk,"I had previously had a Coby CX-CD224 that lasted a whole year, which is really good because I use the cassette deck probably 3 hours a day. It was attractive and worked well. Unfortunately it is not available any more. The closest model I found was this one. The tuner wouldn't hold and the cassette deck wouldn't turn off at the end of the tape. The tape was set up to insert backwards and it was hard to insert as well, plus the buttons were set up in an odd way. I really debated whether to just put up with it because of the hassle of returning it, but when I couldn't tune in the biggest station in town, I returned it and I'm glad I did. I got a full refund, and I bought the Emerson PD6548SL instead. So far it seems to work well."
5,good radio,so far so good it works just fine i just got it so dnt hv much to say about it i love it so far the cd wrks the radio wrks and everything on it.
2,disappointing,"Had to return one due to the cassette door not closing properly, and should have returned the second one since the volume control know does not operate properly."
1,Basic Problem,"The boom box is simple to operate and all, but it simply DOES NOT PLAY MUSIC TAPES. I don't know what to do about it. I have never returned an item to Amazon"
5,Coby CD/Cassette Player with am/fm Player,Has all the features I was looking for and the price was fantastic. The sound is excellent and is convenient to carry around the house.
4,Doesn't have auto-reverse!,"The boombox is good quality and all components work, but in this day and age, who makes a tape player without auto reverse? I liked the price, but missed in the description that it did not have auto-reverse--I have a ton of tapes I play, and have to get up and turn them manually."
1,Cassette player didn't work!,"Need to send back. Cassette player doesn't work and I specifically ordered it so I could listen to my old Xmas Carols. The CD and radio works fine, but don't need it! Needed the cassette tape player. Otherwise, it's a cute little thing, great for the beach or a picnic. Need to get an adaptor for it to play in the car."
1,This is Terrible,I can't believe they're trying to ride on the coat tails of Big & Rich and sell us this crap. Take a listen for yourself. I think you will agree.
3,Interesting,"Well, it's certainly an interesting CD. Would I encourage you to buy it? Sure, if you're a Big & Rich fan, or if you have esoteric tastes in music. There's definintely nothing 'Nashville' about this CD, and one can certainly understand why his label chose to shelve the disc.There's nothing that leaps out as a potential single, and the CD seems oddly unfocused, hopping from the psychedelic 'Candy Coloured Glasses' to the Spanish influenced 'Rhumba' and nearly every genre in between, but the entire CD is oddly engaging. You can definitely hear the germ of Big & Rich in the several songs that feature John Rich on background vocals.All in all, an interesting pre-stardom look at one half of Big & Rich, and one that I would recommend for fans of the duo."
3,Half way to being something special,"The sounds of this music are cutting edge and out there, and stylistically borrow from many generes. At times the music sounds latin, or lounge, or beatles-like, or even like something off U2's Achtung Baby. Unfortunately for a collection of songs that should all be wildly different there is a sameness to the music that takes awhile to figure out. Here's my take. All the songs have about the same tempo, and very basic song structure (that is nearly identical song structure). The wildly varied musical styles on this CD deserve better. Throw some unusual arrangements in there, and switch up tempos a little and this would be much better. As it is I am sure it will blow a lot of straight ahead country listeners away. After all, it is out there, just not as far as some would think, or I would like."
4,ONE WORD FOR THIS CD IS: WEIRD,I AM A BIG & RICH FAN AND HAD TO GET THIS CD WHEN IT CAME OUT. I WILL ADMIT I LISTEN TO SOME WEIRD MUSIC BUT THERE ARE SOME SONGS TO WEIRD FOR ME.BUT I DO LIKE THE CD. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE TRIP AND OUTTA SITE. THE WEIRD SONGS ARE CANDY COLORED GLASSES AND LAST TO KNOW.IF YOU'RE A FAN OF BIG & RICH YOU SHOULD BUY THIS CD. IF YOU LIKE SOME OF THEIR MUSIC DON'T BUY THIS CD BECAUSE IT WILL SCARE YOU.
3,"so bad, it's good","Catchy little tunes that make interesting use of instrumentation, synthesized vocals and word play. Do not expect anything like Horse of a Different Color. This is a whole different sound. I couldn't believe it was the same guy who sings ""save a horse, ride a cowboy"". if you're a serious fan of Kenny's music, you will enjoy it but it's nota CD that you would pay $18.99 for."
5,"Expensive, but worth it!","I know it only holds your mail...and considering that, I realize it is quite expensive. However, it you want a stylish, well made mailbox post...this is the one to buy. I bought the matching mailbox with the copper trim and the copper numbers and it looks great! I am a 58 year old female and installation was not difficult for me."
1,Not even close!,"Don't waste your money. This is not what I wanted, nor what the makers of the program suggest that it can do. What a disappointment."
1,"Only for fun, not real life","Ordered this in hopes of getting a good idea for a new hairstyle but very disappointing. If you want to make funny images of people with purple pigtails, get it! If you want to see serious hairstyles, don't."
4,"Good bag, low price.","I found a review of this bag in Backpacker magaizine and was happy to see Amazon had it cheaper than list. It's compact and lightweight yet roomy enough for a big guy like me. I'm a little too tall for the regular and mummy bags tend to be tight on me, as I have broad shoulders. This bag handles both perfectly. The top doesn't cinch up as tight as I'd like, but works well in the cold anyway. It's not quite meant for as low as they advertise, but you'll be ok down to about freezing."
1,"Tough Instalation, No Tech Support","By far, this is the worst product experience I have ever had. After installing in my computer, my SCSI drive could no longer be read. I contacted Adaptec customer support and they refused to help me until I could get an ID number off the card that I could not get until I booted. I pulled out the card to get the ID number and it fried my motherboard.After getting my computer back from repair, I purchased an LSI Logic SCSI adpater. It worked perfectly and automatically reading the drive that could not be read by Adaptec.Be warned -- Adaptec used to be great and is on the decline. It is a ghost of its former self."
3,"RS-422 works, 485 didnt work for me",I had timing issues with use in the RS485 Conversion mode. Other manufacturers units have worked fine. This one does work in RS-422 mode.
4,Good Book,"Well, it didn't talk so much about power from God as much as it did repentance from sin, which is Mr. Finney's forte', but he did a very good job of bringing Godly conviction!"
2,Quite disappointing,"I bought this book when my first long term relationship was over. I found it very very disappointing, I thought it was full of ways to play mind games. For those who don't just want to ""get laid"", I highly recommend ""My Guy"", by Martin Kantor, and ""Ten Smart Things Gay Men Can Do to Improve Their Lives"", by Joe Kort, instead. They are much much more mature and was very helpful to me. They both were as fun to read as well. I would never waste my money on Mandates."
5,Great summertime read,"Definitely some interesting points in here for someone in the dating scene! I think this book is a very good buy if you are gay and dating and curious about certain aspects of the gay dating scene like I am right now. I just took it to the beach with me and it was really fun. And the guys on the cover are hot, too!"
2,"pretty lame, with a few chuckles","This book offers very little in the way of real dating advice. If you did follow all of this advice, you would basically be a flaky queen. (Perhaps this is the goal?) The author's dishy style can be funny at times, but overall this book is pretty lame. If this is meant to be serious, it does not succeed and is very similar to ""The Principles"" book by Orland Outland a few years ago, which is a better book. If it is meant to be satirical or amusing, ""Husband Hunting Made Easy"" is much, much funnier."
5,"Awesome, this guy rocks","I loved this book, and am coming back to buy two more for friends. At first I thought it would just be funny, but then I read it and didn't put it down all night. It's funny as hell for sure, but it's straight up, smart, and I related to a lot of the stories from the guys in the book. I am 27, have been out for about three years and dating (endlessly???! it seems). Stuff from the book has stayed with me, it was really helpful. Best book on dating other guys I've read."
3,Nice pictures -- of the same three gardens!,"This book is filled with color pictures, but as soon as you examine them closely you realize that they are pictures from different angles of the same three gardens -- most of them incomplete (as stated in their own captions) or violating the author's own rules of not planting your potager with poor-preforming, slow-growing plants. The introduction goes into detail about the first potager, and how she went to visit it in France, but there are no pictures of it! Also disappointing, is that all the potagers displayed are filled with annual vegetables. I didn't see any suggestions on what to plant, or what to do with empty potager beds once the growing season is over. This is a good book to browse in a book store or library but not for the hard-core landscaper or vegetable grower."
4,Very enjoyable.,"I quite enjoyed this. Although there were anachronisms aplenty, it is true that there were women physicians during this time. The clues were fairly obvious, but the use of herbology, use of Chaucer's poems and the position of women during the time was very interesting. The characters were good, particularly Kathryn's servant Thomasina and I didn't mind either the secondary plot or the budding romance between Kathryn and Colum. It's a light, quick read good for a Sunday afternoon."
5,A cosmological love poem with Latin American politics.,"In 474 pages, Ernesto Cardenal weaves a stunning, interconnected parallel between the politics of Latin America, ""astrophysics and love"" (125). His voice and style at times reminds me of Pound in _The Cantos_, ""(Everything I write is fragmentary/ a collection of quanta)"" (Cardenal, 64), but Cardenal is more rooted and accessible. If you enjoy cosomology, quantum physics, love, and/or Latin American politcs, this book will please."
4,Fabulous!,"This perfect cocktail table book is so much fun to read! You feel as though you are getting a rare glimpse into the lives of the people who both built these magnificent ""cottages"" and the families who lived in them. It takes the reader back to a different time and place so different from today yet makes it all come to life! This is a charming book full of wonderful photographs and I highly recommend purchasing it."
4,Great aeronautical reference. Great price.,"Althought written in 1959, this book covers many subjects related to aeronautical knowledge which are still in use today. High speed aerodynamics & aircraft performance are also covered. You dont have to be a naval aviatior for this book."
1,No Packaging/crushed item,This is the second package I received with no packaging at all. The candy bars we have opened (2) are broken/crushed and most of the caramel is spread through the inside of the wrappers. Very disappointed. I see my days of ordering amazon or renewing prime membership going away. Can't even send the bars to school for the kids as they are to messy and crushed.
2,Caramellos melt in warm months,"I ordered this box of caramellos in June, thinking they would somehow keep them cool. There was a packet of some kind of cooling gel in the package, but they are all melted. Probably best not to order them in the warmer months."
3,You Get What You Pay For,I use these things when I volunteer every Saturday at a dog rescue event. I'm no lightweight and it has to hold up for 3 plus hours a week. It seems a little flimsy but is doing fine in the short time I have had it (about 6 uses and counting). It is not a gyp and seems exactly what you would expect for the price. It got to me very quickly. Update: It died yesterday. I got about 10 3 hour sessions out of it at dog adoption days. I'm a big guy (240 lbs.) it would probably last longer with a more waif like person.
4,Country,"I sometimes am a little slow about getting around to buying cd,s that I like. Deryl Dodd is a good example of that. I had two albums of his for a long time and thought that was all that was available,then while listening to music that I was putting on my mp3 player I heard Deryl and then decided to see if ther was more music available. Pleasantly surprised , I found and bought five more albums. Great music at a good price. Thank you."
4,An Authentic Wild West Saga,"The colorful writing of an authentic, unknown old west hero. A personal hero of Buffalo Bill Cody, who writes the forward in this book to his ""mentor"". Mr. Majors was a witness to history and also made history with his Pony Express. He had an old fashioned code of conduct without being moralistic -- no swearing, no drinking and demanded the same from his employees. An honest and modest man who tells what he witnessed at a time when the west was young, new and virtually unsettled."
1,VERY DISSATISFIED!,"THIS CARTRIDGE, ALTHO IT WAS THE CORRECT ONE FOR MY PRINTER, DIDN'T WORK. I BELIEVE I WAS SENT AN EMPTY ONE. MORE THAN THIRTY DOLLARS IS A LOT TO SPEND ON SOMETHING THAT IS USELESS. I RECOMMEND THAT NO ONE BUY IT."
5,GREAT KNIFE SHARPENER,First off you can beat the price second ive had mine for about a year now and it still gets my knives like factory sharp. this is a must buy
5,Loved this as a teen.,"Both my husband and I loved Civ2 as teens. Spent way too many hours playing it. When we saw all 4 games available for $30, we jumped at the chance to have them all. Now we spend way too much time playing Civ4. (Note: if you update Civ4 over the internet, there's a problem with loading shader libraries... google for the answer, it's out there, but it's a bit frustrating if you don't know what to do. But there are lots of Civ4 fansites that can help you.) We're very happy with our purchase."
5,Meier Does It Again,The man really doesn't do anything wrong when it comes to the Civilization series. I have been playing the game since 1989 and I am throughly impressed once again. I own all these games already but to have them in a Vista compatible box is perfect.
2,NOT Updated for XP,"The older games are not recompiled or updated for Windows XP. If you own the older games already, there is no reason to buy this set. Civ II save files crash on loading.The Firaxis web site has no help for Chronicles, just an empty placeholder for downloads."
1,"Boom is the Bomb , the movie bomb .","Whats worse than a power rangers dvd with only one episode ( run time : 22 minutes ) ? The same bonus features ( only 5 minutes ) , but with a different ranger per dvd volume . BORING !!!!!!!"
5,Power Rangers Boom(Vol 4),"I am a huge fan of Power Rangers Space Patrol Delta so this product is awesome. I recommend this DVD for any other Power Ranger fan out there. Not only is this show funny and good for kids, but it also has a story line that I think a lot of people look past. This is a good buy for me, for anyone who enjoys Power Rangers. I really would have wished that they would have continued putting the rest of Power Rangers Space Patrol Delta on DVD for the rest of us to own but either way this DVD is awesome!"
1,Terrible,This game is ridiculous. I got for my brother in law who loves board games for Christmas. We opened it up and tried to learn how to play. 2 hours later we boxed it up as none of us could figure it out or even come close to understanding how to play. We are all highly educated individuals yet we still couldn't figure out how to play this.
5,Cleo,This is an excellent book. I have looked for well over a year to find it and would definitely recommend it as a youth mystery. It's fun and original.
1,There are MUCH better DVDs out there.,"As a personal trainer, I found this instructional video very disappointing. If you want more detailed information and instruction for yourself or for clients, I recommend Kettlebell Basics for Strength Coaches and Personal Trainers by Brett Jones, Kettlebell Basics by Lisa Shaffer, or any of Pavel's DVDs. Don't waste your money on this DVD!"
4,standard work,This work is a must for all (amateur)Egyptologists. It gives a very clear yet thorough view about the difficulty of translation and understanding the Pyramid Texts.
1,Huge letdown,"Huge disappointment. Looking for this movie for ages & it turns out to be issued in a different zone other than mine for the U.S. Odd, since it was a U.S. mini-series when I originally saw this."
1,no US market for this dvd,"i find it very disappointing that this movie, while actually great, seems to only come in a dvd format that is not compatible with dvd players sold here in the united states. I would LOVE to have this movie on dvd and have been looking for it for over two years now and so far have never been able to find a dvd of this movie that is compatible with my dvd player here in the U.S.i am sure im not the only person here in america who would love to have this movie on dvd. if this ever becomes available on dvd here in the states in a format form that IS compatible with dvd players here in the states...please let me know."
1,dissapointment,"Got this two disc set in the mail and immediately put disc number one. It wouldn't load. Put disc number two in and it wouldn't load either. Tried one of my old dvd's to see if was my player and it loaded and played just fine.The worst part came when I tried to contact the seller, Standing Ovation. I never heard back from them. NEVER! Amazon even tried to get them to answer me and they wouldn't. So I got shafted.Don't EVER buy anything from STANDING OVATION!!! They don't back up their product at all."
3,When will a Region One DVD be made available?,This was a great mini series. It has been almost 20 years and I cannot understand why this has never been released as a Region 1 DVD. I am pretty sure it was a CBS mini series.
