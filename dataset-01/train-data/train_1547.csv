4,An oldie but still goodie,"This book was pretty good for when it was written and it will teach you and cover basically everything that the C++ language has to offer. The writing in this book is somewhat stylish but the code examples on the other hand are rather crude. I read the second edition of this book and picked up the third hoping some of the examples would be re-worked in a more modern way but it wasn't. However this is what you get when you try to make this book suitable for both beginners and advanced programmers. You should only get this book if you're going to become serious with C++, otherwise for its price it would be a waste of money. If you're looking for something a little smaller and more to the point then I suggest you pick up the book by Koenig and Moo. However if you want something that covers it all and does so in one book then this is the one. The other large reference books on C++ don't come close to this one."
3,comprehensive but ...,"Comprehensive but there is far too much text to navigate through to find what you want. This is [1] outstanding if you want to just sit back, relax, and read the details about a particular C++ topic BUT is [2] poor if you just want a summary of a feature, [3] poor if you need a quick and handy reference (the operative words here are 'quick' and 'handy'. Kalev's ""ANSI/ISO C++"" is better for this purpose), [4] average if you need to know the why-s behind C++ (better to just get Stroustrup & Ellis ""The Annotated C++ Reference Manual""), [5] poor if you want to learn C++ but have no background in C. Well ... on another plus side, it is much more readable and better looking than the 2nd edition."
3,The essential reference book but a poor introduction,"Stroustrup does not know how to write clearly or explain concepts to beginners.Despite this, this book is the essential reference book on C++, and it is the book I reach for when I need to know something about C++.For beginners, I recommend Ivor Horton's Beginning C++."
2,Don't pick this book if you do not know OOP.,"At first, I thought that this book would be the best book about C++. Well, I was wrong. The author assumed that the readers have a knowledge about objective oriented programming. One of the problem that most of the C++ programmers encounter is the problem of inheritance. Well, there is no good chapter or section that really explain the OOP's inheritance. This book is not good for the reference, either. First, there is no thorough explaination about C++ features. Second, everything in the book is very confusing."
5,The Bible of C++ Programming for Experienced Programmers,This is the bible for C++ programmers. Highly recommended especially if you are a computer science student.
3,"Comprehensive, concise, readable, and illuminating.",This is /the/ book on C++ for readers at intermediate or advanced levels of programming experience. (Beginners should start with a better language for learning how to program - I recommend Scheme.)
4,Grab a stupid quick cheap tutorial then pick this book up.,"This is quite a book. Not that I was looking for a load of laughs, but at times it gets slow and bogged down. I didn't think virtual functions were explained as well as they could have been. The one thing that I definitely found lacking was an explanation of memory such as the concept of the free store etc.Otherwise an excellent book."
2,Not written very well,"A good book for a resource but certainly not as a tutorial on C++, simply because I feel the writing style is unorganized and boring."
1,"If this is anything like the 1991 edition, dont buy it.","I was ""bitten"" by the 1991 edition of this book. Unlike the K&R C book, it provided no summary of the header files in an appendix in the back, and it wasted too much time in management and OO philosophy which was really quite beside the point. Not to mention Bjarne takes some things as articles of faith which people familiar with other, nicer OO languages would take umbrage at."
1,"Help the beginners, please!","I'm sure this book is great for those out there who have some c/c++ experience/knowledge. It seems that almost every book written on any programming language requires some previous knowledge. It would be extremely useful to know where to start!! Anyone know a good BEGINNER book, to learn programming basics for c and c++?!!?? Help, please!"
2,"C++ Programming Language, The (3rd Edition)","this book is indeed difficult to read. the author might be a good programmer, but absolutely not a good writter or teacher, at least for C++ beginners."
1,This book and C++ reminds me of ITU documentation ([stinks]!),"Pretty unreadable stuff. So what if he invented the language, he is standing on the shoulders of giants at ATT and elsewhere. C++ as shown and as implemented is extremely difficult to develop, support and maintain properly. It produces bloated, unreadable code that in the best of worlds with the best of software engineers would be great. Unfortunately in the real world with real software hacks it isn't... Forget about debugging templates, try that for fun!"
1,I hate this book,"UNREADABLE!!!Although I am using C++ for more than 5 years, in many topics I could not understand what he mean. It is said that he is the inventor of C++ language, but BE SURE that this has no effect on this book. Also having a good knowledge does not mean that he would be a good author.Also, the coding convention this guy is really TERRIFIC!Anyway, FORGET ABOU THIS BOOK."
5,Thorkild Jacobsen's Sumerian Translations,"Sumerian texts, particularly poetry, are arguably the most difficult texts to translate. However, Dr. Jacobsen performs with extreme expertise in rendering the flow and feeling of these texts into english. One of the finest Sumerologists of the 20th century, Jacobsen brings a long dead culture to life. Very enjoyable to read and provided with detailed explanations of concepts. Mythological literature is also included."
3,Best sounding CD - clock,Sound is great. Excellent bass. But the clock functions is ........not good. 1. No battery backup. Need reset after power outage for more than 10-20 minutes. 2. Talks to you after power outage. I don't care to be waken during a short power outage. 3. Difficult to set alarm in the Dark 4. Difficult to turn off in the dark. 5. No timer function. 6. too bigTHe sound is really good. I hate to return it but I did.
1,No Headphone Jack,I bought this because it said it had a headphone jack. What a rip off. None on it or in any af the paperwork. Bogus description.
3,I Believe It's Not Butter.,"The 5th Edition (6/9/00),... has the lakes, rivers and ports covered, but in black and white; all land formations are sepia. No greens, no blues, no magenta. Using Richardsons' is like going back to 1-2-3 V.2.2: the data is right but the data is unfriendly. Colors are there on NOAA charts to make navigation buoys leap out, starboard or port, to cite only one use of color.This criticism aside, lots of good information is assembled here, general as to navigation and specific as to port facilities. If the chart reproductions were not so insipid, Richardsons' might take two more stars."
2,odd flavor,"I bought this a few years ago and really liked it. They must have changed the recipe because this just tasted odd, sort of medicinal."
4,Esto si que mola,Es un conjunto de los mejores cha cha cha de la historia ejecutados con calidad y emocion
4,Great value for the price,"Since I liked it so much, I decided to purchase a second one the day the first one arrived. Was very disappointed to see that the price has gone up $10 in just one week! However, the quality is good and I am satisfied with the item."
2,Not worth it!!!!,I bought this TV and after 5 months...the laser in the DVD player went out. Yes I was covered by the warranty BUT RCA doesnt make the part. So I had to special order the part and of course RCA still hasnt shipped it to my TV repair shop. So here it is November and I still dont have my TV! Dont buy this TV. The price keeps dropping b/c they are no longer carrying the parts!!
1,Outdated information,I am very displeased with this book. The information in it is outdated and not very useful.
2,NOT 18/10,"I dont know who the reviewer below talked to at Reed & Barton, but this set is NOT 18/10. Its 18/0. I confirmed with Reed & Barton that this set is 18/0. Very Disappointed."
2,Made in China,"I had to send this back because it is made and China, and I do not want to eat off of silverware from China"
4,Looking for a non-expensive Cd player if so buy this,"The Sony D191 has a great price, it has an awesome sound system in it its got alot of features too it and is not expensive.This is a great cd player for $60 its something to check out."
1,Absolutely horrid player- get an AIWA instead,"I had this player for about four months and it was my first portable CD player. It wasn't that good, but I thought it was ok because I didn't know any better. That is, until this player completely quit on me out of nowhere and I bought an AIWA player that's the same price as this one that's around 1,000 times better than this player.This Sony model has passable sound, but other than that, it skips almost constantly. I couldn't even walk down stairs without it making that skipping sound almost non-stop. The AIWA V-50 is a smaller player that's almost infinitely better. This Sony model doesn't even have a pause button!"
1,do not buy,"this cd player is no good. It skips constantly,the batteries don't last long,and mine broke after 4 months. Also, the head phones it comes with are horrible."
2,Good Price Poor Quality,"I went with this brand because Sony has a good name and the price was right.The player Skips if you breath to hard and the the sound quality is not very good. They give you a ""Mega Base"" setting but it should really be called a ""destory you music"" setting, because if you use this feature at all you cannot recognize the music your are listening to and forget ""pause"" that is not an option on this model.If your low on cash and need to replace your CD player fast go for it but if you want something for the long haul, hold out for a better model.You get what you pay for with this Sony CD Player. Athough with all the faults, this model could have been priced atleast $20.00 less."
4,"Good, but could be better","I got this CD player as a gift at least 2 years ago and it has lasted me for that long. It is of high quality and may not be totally modern but it does play music and that's why you buy discmans right? Anyway, there are a couple things that could be improved. First, it doesn't have antiskip so everytime you even tap it, it will stop and then start up again 10 seconds later. Don't worry, it doesn't damage your CDs or at least it hasn't damaged any of mine. Second, it doesn't have a pause button which really stinks. Third, the headphone that come with it are really bad. The foam is peeling off and the sound is not very strong. Also, after you've had it a while you'll notice that you have to move the little headphone plug around to get the sound to come in with out crackling or only coming out in one ear.So if you want a durable CD player, get this!"
3,frustrating,"This is a mediocre CD player. It plays your CDs with decent sound, nothing more, nothing less. It's very wierd, however, that I have dropped this player over 10 times. I've owned several portable CD players and have dropped this one more than all of my others combined. It also has so pause button, which should be illegal. Its the first CD player I've ever seen with no pause button. Also, with the Super Bass thing on, I'll turn it up to full volume and it'll make popping sounds. I also hope you don't intend to jog (or do anything where you need to move) because it will skip all the time.The bottom line: buy this if you see it for cheap or you won't be using it much, other wise go with something else."
4,OK but not great...,"This is OK except for the missing pause button and it skips constantly. The sound is great with the Mega Bass. I would not recommend this for anyone who would be using this while in motion because of its skipping. I don't see anything wrong with the headphones, though. The Hold button is very useful."
5,For Everyone,"This wine buying guide is ideal for anyone, wine expert or novice.It is easily read and organized. The best part is you'll learn what wines taste the best and cost the least!!"
1,bad product,"Batery was empty, and is not water proof.... Bad product... I do not like this watch. I send as a gift, and now i feel bad"
1,I Can't Believe It...,"This poetry is terrible, some of the worst I've seen. The words have no meaning, there is no feeling behind it. The only reason he got published is because of his muscular dystrophy. Don't get me wrong, but using your own health conditions for pity isn't alright."
4,The Stars are Shining in Your Heart Tonight,"Mattie Stepanek's poetry leaves some people wondering how a child could express his thoughts and feelings with such style and grace, and yet as I read through the pages I find myself understanding exactly what he means, and remembering my own special words for entities when I was a child. Mattie is sparked with the grace all of us are born with, but few continue to hold. He exhibits real intelligence, not by calculating or giving us a technological advancement, not by teaching us how to manage our money or how to avoid shelling it out to the IRS. Mattie's intelligence is of the highest variety--the understanding that Love is Law and that the only things of value in this world are the eternal souls--fellow human beings made in the Creator's Image--that we meet and hopefully commune with (rather in a sandbox or by a fireplace) every day of our lives."
5,Mattie Stepanek Still LIVES and Breathes,"This AUDIO BOOK of spoken poetry is the 4th installment of the 5 original VSP-Published books of HeartSongs by Mattie Stepanek. Celebrate Through Heartsongs is among some of his very best poetic efforts. Mattie Stepanek died on 22 June 2004 (at age 13) from Dysautonomic Mitochondrial Myopathy, a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Mattie was a confirmed genius, but a humble and sweet one who loved God and hated no one. This is a collection of poems that speak volumes about Mattie's wisdom and insights into such difficult topics as: Fear, Love, Suffering, Lonliness, Relationships, Life's Goals/Dreams, and Impending Death. Mattie had the wisdom and understanding of a 52 year old adult.This audio book of Mattie's poems (in fact ALL of the 5 books) is read by Mattie, himself. He is 100% genuine and 100% endearing! His voice alone, gives the listener marvelous glimmers of his erudite, but very gentle personality."
5,great poetry!!!,His poetry is some of the best I have ever heard. It is even better to hear him read the poems. This book is worth buying. He will touch your heart.
5,Current CD to Minidisc Steal!!!,"This CD player is awesome!!! It is the cheapest CD player (the ""used"" ones are actually factory sealed) with an optical out. I only intended to use it to digitally send sonds to my minidisc player, but it has great volume (much more than what you would expect from a portable) and the sound quality and build are top notch. I am so shocked that I got this new CD player for ""so little"".If you are a minidisc owner, pick this up immediately!"
4,The True Life Story of a Tractor,"My husband and I were thrilled to see a ""true"" tractor story, after buying our son a tractor board book full of errors (published in England!). Craig Brown is a terrific illustrator -- his work reflects the lush greens and bright tractor reds of farm country. These illustrations are definitely the high point of the book. And Brown knows his farm culture, having grown up in Iowa farm country. The story is simple and matter-of-fact, but your little truck and machine buff will love all the different things a tractor does. The book would go great with the John Deere models - explaining what everything does. For more, check out My Barn and The Patchwork Farmer, also by Craig Brown."
5,Don't Be Mislead: This Is Pure Pop For Now People!,Forget the Pete & Pete connection; sure the show was too hip for cable tv. The Polaris CD is better than any REM album (sorry glums). This is really the Miracle Legion in disguise and they should keep it up. Why did it take so bloody long to get this magic music out of the cereal box and into our ears?
4,A real trip to thr moon..........,This is a fun CD to listen to. It reminds me of a fantastic show that was very underrated. Pete & Pete was great to watch and it was just what I needed at that time of my life. Great memories. Thanks Polaris
4,Fun music from a fun show,"""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" was one of the most clever and entertaining programs ever offered by Nickelodeon, and the music of Polaris was a great addition to the show. These are catchy, fun tunes, and you may as well buy the disc, because some of these songs will stick in your head anyway. Fans of Miracle Legion will enjoy Polaris, which is comprised of all but one of the members of ML. Get it - you'll be glad you did."
2,It's O.K.,"Except for the title song, Hey Sandy, the Polaris soundtrack to ""Pete & Pete"" is really pretty lame. I probably would not have bought this cd if I'd had known in advance that the title song is the only song that connects with the series. On the other hand... when and if they come out with ALL the Pete & Pete episodes on dvd... I'm gonna buy 'em all!"
1,Pathetic,"From one of the most moronic TV shows ever comes a batch of ersatz music which nearly surpasses the show in mediocrity. Musically, Polaris is in a category somewhere between the Banana Splits and the Chipmunks. They sound like a group of less-than-talented eight-year-olds trying to start a garage band. Highly overrated at even one star. P.U.!"
4,For any fan of mid 90's music,"This just isn't for fans of ""Pete & Pete"" but for anyone who enjoyed music in the early to mid 90's. Polaris reminds me of bands like Buffalo Tom or Soul Asylum and that's definitely a good thing. Pretty much everything is covered here from the ""Pete & Pete"" show and Polaris's quirky brand of music added a lot to any already weird show. ""Summerbaby"", ""Waiting For October"", etc. are all good. One star off for poor production but overall I guess I can't really complain. The songs are heartfelt and I guess remind me of a simpler time in my life. I can't recommend this cd any more highly than that."
4,Don't miss the band behind this band,"It is probably mentioned in other reviews; but Polaris is essentially the band Miracle Legion which released some of the best songs I have ever heard in my life.Sadly, most of their stuff is out of print, but if you like this and you can track down ""The Backyard"", ""Surprise, Surprise, Surprise"" or ""Me and Mr. Ray"" you will be rewarded greatly."
5,Way Ahead of their time,"It's amazing these days how many ""indie bands"" are corporatly rising, which puts frowns on alot of heartful listeners. This album is soley one of the most underated albums of the 90's. If you were a frequent viewer of the Adventures of Pete and Pete , you'll love it, or if you enjoy clean, lyrical songs about, love and seasons, this is a classic. Lyrically its very melodic and simple, and musically, its clean , and the way the songs are arranged shows where overated bands like, ""The Strokes"" and ""Interpol"", got their influences. My favorite song titles include ""Saturnine"" and ""Recently"", both musically and lyrically masterpieces."
5,The Best,"I love all of Chef Paul seasonings. Poultry, Veal & Pork, Meat..... I make a lot of his recipies so I like to buy it in this size can."
5,Love this spice!,"First package was dropped off in the rain and got soaked through. The company promptly resent another.This is so much cheaper than buying it in the supermarket. I love the flavor and for me it tastes really good on Ribeye steak with a pinch of salt on each side before using the seasoning.I also use it on chicken, it's mild but very tasty."
2,Bad Listing,"This item does not have any of Roy Drusky's vocals, in fact there are no vocals at all. The Album title is ""in the style of Roy Drusky"" with the first part in 8 point and the name in 20 point letters. Unless you are just into the background music leave this alone!"
3,Not what I had hoped for,"Not the worst book I have read on investments, but certainly not the best. The author spends much of the book explaining why he believes standard option trading techniques are doomed to fail in the long term, but his rationale are at best fuzzy. He does do a decent job of outlining his twist on covered call writing and portfolio hedging, but does a poor job of backing up his claims; uses a lot of statements like 'should create a greater return' than standard methods. Should? I'd like to see a bit more testing than just his gut feel. Overall, a quick read, lots of Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets, and some potentially useful ideas, but be prepared to work out a lot of it on your own."
3,"simple ,clear and to the point",I started to understand things better about the why and the why not of options.Definitely recommend it to beginners.
2,Not an options-expert,"This so-called options-expert says that options have a different value for different investors. Well, that's simply not true, it doesn't matter whether you buy an option for speculative reasons, or write it to make some extra return, you can calculate the optionprice with the Black and Scholes fomula.The author correctly states that you should buy options that are undervalued, but his buying criteria don't make any sense.This book contains many other errors, and with this book you will definitely not outsmart the pros, as the title suggests."
5,Techno + Classical + a Dash of Brilliance = Akino Arai,"I absolutely L O V E this CD!If she were here right now, I'd give her a big wet kiss on the lips! =D"
4,Review of Transatlantic Tunnel,"This is about as obscure as it gets, which is a tragedy. I went in expecting an exciting sci-fi adventure, and was very surprised to find a tense, realistic drama with characters you begin to genuinely care about. The plot concerns the construction of an enormous undersea tunnel that connects the US and England. The sci-fi element is secondary, almost an atmospheric necessity for the hypothetical story, but the technological predictions that are there are strikingly accurate. The story isn't as concerned with the actual construction of the tunnel as it is with the toll it takes on its creator and lead engineer, and his family, as he devotes years of his life to the project. The film has a somewhat distanced, procedural tone, which is extremely unusual, especially for its time. But as I said, the characters and relationships slowly creep up on you and create some unexpected emotional heft by the end."
2,good looking belt,"When I orderd this nice looking belt I thought as pictured it would be woven the full length, however it came with a long length of flat belt that had the holes for the buckle, one morning when I put it on the flat belt part separated from the webbing, this was a nice belt that was just for Sunday,was very disapointed, Dean from IL."
1,WAAAAAAAY OVERPRICED!,"You can buy this at Barnes & Noble for $10.00........this is waaaaaay overpriced for this old of a book, especially!"
4,Good cast in well-made thriller.,Marc Singer and Mary Crosby are well paired in this entertaining though short thriller. Worth a look.
2,Critical Politics Alienated me,"I have read and enjoyed other books by this author, especially Intercessory Prayer and Praying for Lost Loved Ones, but just a few chapters into this, I felt offended by his overtly right-wing politics. I'm a God-fearing, God-loving, prophetic and prayerful Christian who also happens to be of liberal ilk on many topics (issues of social welfare, for example), but he seemed to tar all liberals as anti-God, and I just don't find that a helpful or loving discussion in a book about prayer. It just seems unnecessarily divisive, so I admit that I have now firmly closed the book's cover and have determined to sell it second-hand at the first chance I get."
4,great book on prayer,Book is simple yet profound. Great instrument in helping you to write your own bible based prayers. I recommend it.
5,authority to pray,"I have really loved reading this book. Lots of great stuff to encourage and spur you on to prayer. We had a coyote problem in our neighborhood for 4 days. The Lord said, take authority over them. So I did. And they haven't been back since. Prayer is a practicle thing for all who will dare to line up with the Lord and take Him at His word!!"
4,GREAT!,"Great book, great examples to help further understand. I certainly would recommend this book to all who want to continue growing in their prayer life."
5,Authority in Prayer: Prayer with Power and Purpose,I really enjoy everything I've read of Dutch Sheets' and if I'm not mistaken we also have a hard copy of this selection.
5,Down home with Chuck,"Having read and re-read this book, I can only say BRAVO to the author. His style, wit and humor shine through, and are welcome in a world where the news often is filled with gloom."
3,Betty must be awesome live.,"This CD gives you an idea of what it must be like to hear them live. It Girl and Naughty Nadia are my favorites. This is my second favorite Betty album. ""Carnival"" is on the top of my list. I recommend both CDs to all Betty fans."
3,strong performances,"Unfortunately as with many American produced DVDs, this disk stops midway and will not play any further. Returning disks doesn't help as they are all made that way. However, I've found that sometimes you can restart the disk and go to the end of the program and back your way into it until you get the the number just after the place that stopped. If you are very lucky you'll get to see the rest of the performance. That's what happens with this disk.It's very unfortunate as the performance is excellent. The voices are strong. Caballe's voice is still wonderful and the high notes sung so softly are absolutely melting. I do wish more Massenet operas were being filmed so that those of us who can't attend live performances could still benefit from these wonderful artists' talents.I gave only 3 stars because of the poorly produced dvd that won't play all the way through."
5,One of the Greats,"This is probably the most popular game in the world from a highly respected German designer. It's really fun to play, and turns come around quickly. The rules are hard to learn from scratch, but not so hard to explain once you've played through. It plays differently with three versus four players. With three, the board is wide open, and the game is a little more mellow. With four, it's possible to get walled in, and there is much more tension to the game. I always use this game as an introduction to gaming for people who haven't played many games, and they love it. It's different every time because the board is set up randomly. There are several expansion sets that add different elements to the game. The best is Cities and Knights of Catan, although it makes for a longer, more involved game. You cannot go wrong with this purchase."
5,Great game!,"Our family loves this game! It is easy to learn, has just the right elements of strategy and luck, and an entire game can be played in 1 to 2 hours. As a mom of 8 children, it is hard for me to sit down and play some games, like monopoly, or risk, because of the length of time involved. This one is perfect. Even my 9 yr. old can play, although she still doesn't get all the strategy involved. It's a great game - and we have enjoyed adding the expansion packs and other added elements of the game, such as Seafarers, and Cities and Knights."
4,"Strategy, fun and Victory!","I just played this game for the first time a week ago and it is amazingly fun! The game is simple enough for anyone to learn yet has the options for it to contain more strategy than a game like say Risk.It's no surprise that this game was the game of the year in I believe 1997. It was out of print for awhile, but Mayfair games has returned and is an excellent 4 player game. The game changes a little if you buy the 5-6 player expansion pack, but that just gives you more options to make the game different and unique each time you play!Ladies even enjoy this one, which is a bonus for us guys to find a strategy game that many of them will enjoy playing with us! Have some fun settlin the Island of Catan today!"
5,A Great Game for after the kids are asleep!,"Lots of fun ! We first played this game while staying with some friends. It helps if at least one player has played it before, because the directions can be a little hard to figure. This is a great ""couples game"" for after the little ones are sleeping."
4,"Classic, but there are better","OK Settlers is fantastic. But there are better games I assure you. Settlers is good in that it has mild strategy, and great player interaction. But terrible in that it takes 20 minutes to explain the rules to someone. Also, it stinks because there is such a huge dice luck factor. Everything hinges on good dice rolling. Try Princes of Florence for a much better strategy game. Ticket to ride for a better light strategy game.Boardgames rule!"
5,"This game is much more than a ""toy"" - a prima board game!","The questions for ratings may be misleading because this board game is not for little children, hence the durability score (small parts, etc). If you change the educational value question to ""strategy/analysis skills building"" it is most definitely a 5; change the durability question to ""how often you will want to play it"" and you get another 5. Gamers who have cut their chops on role-playing will enjoy this game, but boomers who were bored out of their mind with Monopoly will LOVE playing it with their older kids. It's a savvy mix of LIFE, the Simms series and Monopoly - but the ratio of chance vs. keen strategy (and sometimes cunning) tips far to the latter. An EXCELLENT game!"
5,Best board game since Monopoly,Its not exactly like monoply but its still fun. You make cities and towns and roads and you have to think really hard. It s really fun and I played it at camp alot ...
3,Overly hyped game. Fun but there are better,"This is a game too much luck. Real strategy is thrown away by the roll of the dice. My friends and I are heavy boardgamers from American to German games alike, and this rarely gets mentioned as a game to play again. Its a sold 3 star game but not much more than that. ..."
3,Missing Pieces in the box,"Well, the only real reason you buy this expansion pack is for the extra pieces...unfortunately the version I got was missing 4 settlement pieces for one of the colors. Great right?"
2,Disappointed after reading such high reviews,"I ordered this for my nephew after reading all the high reviews. The game may be fun once your read the 16 page instructions, but we gave up after 1 hour of reading the instructions and still not fully understanding the game rules. There are certainly many games that I would recommend over this one. Sorry for the bad review, but this game did not measure up to all the great reviews I read :("
4,Settlers of Catan Review,Good game. My fourth grader understood it well. My first grader could play with assistance.
5,This is a great family game,"My family loves this game. It is complicated enough to play often without getting bored. But, also it is simple enough that anyone can learn to play it well after just a few games.This game is very well ballanced. While it is possible for a very good player to win every time, it is also possible for the other players to prevent someone from ever winning. This game requires diplomacy, cooperation, and tactics.My 7 year old daughter and 11 year old daughter love the game, and have an equal chance of winning (with a little stealth intervention from me anyway). Also, when everyone plays quickly, the game can be completed in less than an hour.Also, i like the fact that i dont have to sing, act, draw pictures, remember trivia, or shout words when i play this. But, that's just a personal preference."
5,A Fantastic Game,"This is an excellent game with a lot of replay value. My friends and I have played Risk and Monopoly a great deal and Catan is at least as good, if not better, than those games. It's more reliant on strategy than Monopoly, and it's easier to learn how to win at than Risk. The biggest drawback is that without the expansion the game only supports up to four players, but that flaw is made up for in the fact that you can buy expansions, and the replay value inherent in the game. The replayability is really the best thing about the game. Every game of Catan has new challenges because the board is different every time. I would highly recommend this game for anyone, board game enthusiast or not. It's not that hard to learn and it's extremely fun to play, especially for people who favor games of strategy over those of luck."
3,Settlers of Catan,"I think this is an awesome game, and its really fun it's kinda like a mix between monopoly and risk but much much funner. YOU would definitely enjoy it. But don't get discouraged if at first you don't understand it... it takes a little while to get the hang of it. And when you do it is really fun!"
4,Beware there is a newer version of this available now,"Only after opening the game, I realized that this is an older version of the product. The newer version (v4, I believe) comes with a outer skeleton for the board, which keeps all the pieces tightly in-place. This one, unfortunately does not. So, a rough throw of the dice can easily mess up the board.It is still a great game, but I'd hope that Amazon would just stop selling this version some time soon!"
5,Very fun game,"I purchased this game toy for a friend who loves board games. She has a million and one so finding something different was quite a challenge. But when I saw this game here at Amazon and all the reviews, I ordered it for her. She came back the following week to tell me how much she loves playing with it with her family.Great game, she says."
4,Requires varying strategies,"This game takes a bit of time to setup and read through the instructions the first time. But it is rather simple and straight forward there after. Because you can vary the playing board, your strategy will often need to change with each game. Those who are good at convincing others to trade, even when the competition is heated, will do well."
4,Fun game for teens and adults,"This is a great game. Takes a little while to get started, but once you get the hang of it, it is really fun and requires you to think.One drawback is that you can only play with 4 players/teams. (There are expansion packs I'm told.)I recommend this game for teens and adults, although younger players could probably figure it out also."
3,Perfectly Readable,"I give this book 3.5 stars. It's got a nicely developed protagonist, even though I wish she was more flawed, and setting, with a smooth narrative to bring it along. I adore snakes, and I love the idea of the healing snakes, so kudos for that touch. The minor characters ranged from being OK to not-so-spiffy from the critic's perspective.The plot has a leisurely pace, so while this is technically an adventure story, don't expect the ""action"" which normally typifies an adventure. The climax didn't work for me, but otherwise the plot is sound.Overall, there is not much in the way of fresh insights or amazing writing. This is just a book which is a modest pleasant read once you're involved in the story."
4,It's No Mystery,"A very good read based on the actual texts of the bible. In my opinion Mr Perry does an excellent job of summarising the events leading up to and including the DAY OF THE LORD. Reading this book will forewarn the reader with knowledge of what to expect should the End of Days occur in this generation. While his depth of knowledge on scripture comes out in his book , He's humble enough to reminds us not to take his word for what is to come but to check the facts for ourselves. This is a book well worth a read."
2,Pioneers of early childhood education,"The book is in great shape, but the depth of content for the price is way out of line."
3,A major problem,"Overall, my 3 year old loves these videos, and I think they are fairly educational, so I don't have a problem with that. The one big disturbing problem that I do have with these videos is that they have young children going off with a strange adult without checking with their parents. In this video, the young boy is looking for his father, finds hard hat harry instead and goes off with him. Not a good message. Otherwise, I like the videos just fine."
4,My 2-1/2 yr olds love this.,"Desperate for truck dvds that would keep my little guys attention after mighty machines (too informational for these two right now) failed us, stumbled upon this. Happy Accident! Despite being 15 years old and a little cheesy my one little monster truck freak LOVES IT! His brother likes it too, just doesnt love it. Only reason I am not giving it five stars: the DVD cover has new awesome trucks shown. My son cant understand why ""those"" trucks arent on the DVD. That upsets him very much!"
4,My 3yr old loves it but the acting is awful...,"I'm able to watch this on netflix and my 3yr old wants me to put this on daily. He loves this video but as for me I think it's awful. The acting is the worst and the filming is pretty terrible. Why give it 4 stars? Well the purpose is to keep my 3yr old entertained, and it does, he loves the monster trucks."
1,Terrible. Don't waste your money.,"Worst DVD we have ever purchased. Camera work is terrible, horrendous acting, dated, and just plain awful. We threw it out after the first 10 min."
3,For hardcore pirate fans only.,"While I found Cutthroats to be one of those games you can lose yourself in and spend all day enthralled with, you have to be a pretty hardcore fan of all things pirate to do it. This game is chock full of loopholes and missing bits of continuity that make your expected victories a little confusing. Plus, I've run this game on a couple of different computers and found that the programming tends to get bogged down the longer you play as one character. In other words, just when you finally get your pirate the way you want him the whole thing kind of crashes. So if you like roleplaying as a pirate this game is for you, but if you like high quality flawless playing you should look somewhere else."
4,Lotsa fun but lacks speed,"I have been able to play this game over and over tirelessly, it seems to pose new challenges everytime but if faults in speed, for example, when you land troops at the beach, they move toooooooo slllllllllooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwww. There's no thing to change the speed and it gets particulary infuriating in big towns like Tortuga, you have to personally guide their each and every movements, their each and every targets to kill, and their each and every step to avoid cannons and grenadiers. Also, its literally HELL, to invade towns with cannons close to your ships because they can ripp your ships apart in seconds on the coast."
2,unstable game.,Looking for a contemporary version of Sid Meier's Pitrates! ? Keep on looking. This game is too unstable to enjoy and has poor documentation. Quite a disappointment.
2,They've cut their own throats with this game....,"This program is, in a word, disappointing. I am constantly making comparisons to Sid Meier's Pirates! and coming away saddened that a 15+ year old game is superior in playability and pleasure. Certainly, the graphics are better than in Pirates, but the game is so cumbersome that it seems virtually impossible to ever find the exact correct balance of resources, crew members, and missions to be successful. I guess I'll just keep looking for a good follow up to Pirates!"
4,A very satisfying middle-of-the-road performance,"I was profoundly impressed by Dohnanyi and the Clevelanders when they played this greatest of Mahler symphonies at Carnegie Hall. Unfortunately, it's impossible to encapsulate that amazing experience in a recording. In CD, the directness of Dohnanyi fails to put him on a par with other great interpreters of this symphony. The electricity generated in the concert hall is somehow missing. It's still a very considerable achievement. The Cleveland Orchestra's playing is polished, transparent. The very first climax in the Andante has a beautifully controlled crescendo that shows what this performance is about. Not radical at all. Not too dark, not sunny (if it's possible to be sunny with the Ninth). This middle-of-the-road approach is an asset, but also a liability. Because it's possible to have more excitement with Zander or Karajan or Barbirolli. Anyway, a very satisfying performance."
4,Binoculars For Birding,"I decided to try this rather obscure brand and am not disappointed. I previously had been doing my ""birding"" with my Swarovski 8x30's and while they are excellent, I needed more magnification for my aging eyes and I didn't want to pay the price of the Swarovski 10x42 roof prisms. I had previously tried my son-in-law's Nikon Monarch's 10x42 and was ready to buy a pair when I came across the Zhumell 10x42 during a internet search. I was able to purchase these from Amazon at a much better price than the Monarch's. They are equally as sharp as the Nikon and they focus a lot closer. My only criticism is they are a bit heavy, but worth the buy none the less."
3,Not so bright,Not as bright or sharp as indicated. My Celestron Noble 8X32 are way better. They are certainly not in the quality range that they say their list price is. I've returned mine.
1,OUTDATED COLOGNE,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON TABAC COLOGNE.ITS SMELLS BAD AND VERY OUTDATED.G
2,Not what I was use to,"My first use was in later 60's when I was stationed in Germany. I purchased the same name and product in 1966. To this day I still have the same bottle with just a few drops left. I don't know if mine has aged, but it smells different than this new one I just received. It does not have the deep smell of the original one I bought and I thought I was getting the same product. I don't think I would purchase this product again as the original one was definitely a winner. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"". You lost a winner."
3,Classic Scent - NOT for Everybody,"While this is a classic scent and is very masculine, I do NOT agree that it is a scent every man could wear. It is definitely geared for older gentleman. It definitely has a heavy powder note to the scent that is indicative of men in their 50s or older. Perhaps a gentleman in his 40s could wear this scent, but that's as far as I would go. For anyone younger, I would recommend something a bit less powdery, a bit sweeter, but still as spicy, such as Havana."
3,for me but not her,"Well, it gets great reviews, I am afterall from Germany so thought ""why not try it?"" I think it is distinctive, fresh and clean. My wife on the other hand won't cuddle when I wear it. Any one want a free almost full bottle? I still like it but what's the point, I'll keep the wife, she's otherwise pretty darn wonderful."
4,Tabac,"Have used the product for over 30 yrs.Light, distictive, not over powering.one of the best colognes that I have used over the years."
4,Tabac Cologne,"Great deal for the price! Get compliments on the smell - not too ""sweet"" or over-powering."
4,Pretty good!,"I can't comment on the topnotes etc., but I do love this scent. My only grip is that it does take quite a bit to get decent lasting power with this cologne. Whenever the scent fades, you are left with a very powdery smell very similar to baby powder. That's my only true grip- I hate smelling like baby powder if I can't reapply!"
1,Item advertised was not delivered,"The description and pictures for this item clearly and explicitly indicate that it is the eau de cologne that is for sale. I was sent the eau de toilette instead which is an entirely different product with a distinct composition and smell. If you are looking for the actual product advertised, I strongly suggest you look elsewhere."
3,"Solid, but not in depth","Overall, ""Reading John"" is a solid commentary, although it is not a verse by verse commentary. Rather, the book deals with themes and concepts and does a fine job cross-referencing them throughout the Gospel and Letters of John.The author spent several pages at the beginning arguing for his preferred chronology of the four texts. While the brief historic overview was insightful, the author does not make a convincing case as to why his (or any other orderings) really matters in regards to the text and interpretation of the text."
5,Sony portable tape recorder,"Sony TCM-929 Pressman Desktop Cassette Recorder with Automatic Shut-OffGreat basic tape recorder which is what I was looking for. Easy to use.Buttons push easy. Counter makes it easy to find exact spot on tape.Sound is ok for a small recorder. Have not yet recorded on it, but plan to. I would highly recommend this product to anybody looking for a basic tape player/recorder; nothing fancy, everything I was wanting & it's a Sony product. Comes with AC/DC plug or you can use batteries. Also has handle to carry."
4,Good buy for the money.,"I bought this item and had to return it because it didn't work, BUT the return process was very simple and not the hassle that I thought it would be at all. The second tape player that I received has worked fine. This is fine for light to moderate use by someone who takes care of their things. I wouldn't trust it to children who will bang it around a lot, but for older kids or adults who can treat it gently it would be fine."
4,Sony 'shoebox' cassette recorder,"The Sony TCM-929 Pressman Desktop Cassette Recorder with Automatic Shut-Off is a perfectly serviceable cassette tape recorder and player. I bought it specifically to move my cassette tape collection to digital format on the computer. You will need a couple of double male-male patch cords to connect the earphone and mike ports to your sound card. Then, with an inline .wav, .mp3 or .ogg sound recorder program, you're all set. The system worked fine for me, and I completed the conversions in several weekend evenings.Amazon offered this machine at a price that I could not ignore. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a reasonably sturdy, and capable cassette tape recorder or player.Obviously, at this price, you are not going to get studio sound quality, but it seems to be much better than I expected. Of course the quality of your tapes is also important.I recommend the item for the limited uses that I've suggested."
4,pros and cons,"It is a quality item from a quality source. The price is low. It is small enough to fit almost anywhere. The sound quality is excellent. The two problems I have are as follows. the instructions say to disconnect the plug from the power source,I have never heard of that before. It is a bit noisy in a quiet bedroom you can hear the tape spinning."
3,Slight surface noise when using built in microphone,"Still, for my needs, you can't beat the price. I'm an actor, I use it to rehearse monolologues. But if it's production quality you're looking for, better go to some more expensive models."
1,Do not order this from BuyAccessories,"This recorder may be a good one for those who received an operable machine, but it turns out BuyAccessories will not back a defective product for an exchange. Our only option, if THEY decide to accept it, is to return it for only a portion of the money we paid for it. That policy, for a company that is represented through Amazon, is a terrible violation of basic consumer trust and makes me sorry I ever ordered. Find another source!"
1,waste of money,"this item lasted about two weeks before losing all audible sound with or without earphones and despite frequent cleanings. certainly expected better quality from sony. not worth the shipping to return it, nor would i want another."
5,Great Product,I have been using this almost daily and love it. I use rechargeable batteries and get many hours of play out of each charge. I love it because it is portable and I can easily take my audio book with me. Prompt shipping as always.
3,Quality is OK,"I thought the recording quality would be better, but it is just OK. Every thing works well on the recorder and easy to use."
1,It's noisy,"Unfortunately, I ended up buying 2 of these. My first order was not new. It was just wrapped in a plastic with tapes. Since I needed it badly at that time, I took a chance. After a month's use, it became unbearably noisy. I ordered another one again, hoping this time they will send me a new one. They did but the noise is still there. When I tried to return the second one, they said I already bought 2 of those and was put on hold for a long time.Don't buy it--it's just a waste of money."
5,Best Price!,I purchased this tape player for my five year old. Its a sturdy one and easy to use. The best part is the price. Most tape players run over $20.00 in retail stores. I may buy another one for when this one expires.
4,second response,It is my recollection that I already submitted a review. I gave it 4 stars. One of the questions I was asked was if I had received the recorder during the period specified by Amazon. It came a few days later than the one established. It is a minor quibble and I am otherwise satisfied with the product.
5,The Best,"I'm a singer who owned the previous model for 20(yes) 20 years.It was cue/ review ff/rewind torture for the machine, as I used it for voice lessons.It just recently quit.'nuff said."
3,"Very good for voice, many features. Weak on my music.","Upon reading other customer reviews I bought this tape recorder. It is ok for voice recording and playback, but when I recorded my piano practice the playback sounded awful. Since I had bought it for that purpose I returned it. For voice it has a good tone and the machine noise is less than others I have heard. So, especially considering all the features including cue/review it is a good choice for voice recording."
5,Just A Quality Tape Recorder,"Well made, inexpensive, simple to use cassette Tape Recorder. Thankfully it does not have 43 ""extra"" functions that you will never use and require 3 hours and a Degree from MIT to program before it starts to function.It works well, and is truly portable with one hand so it can be used as you walk with any optional plug in microphone and headset ( not included ) if you also require privacy in recording/playback.I wish I could give it 10 Stars."
5,A needed item,"With the purchase of a new car, I found that I had no way of playing my favorate cassette tapes. This works great and I use it in the house as well as on the road."
4,Does exactly what it should,"I bought this tape player with a very specific purpose in mind. I am a criminal defense attorney and the majority of the recordings provided to us by the court or the prosecution come on tapes. I needed something to play the tapes in my office and occasionally in court. It had to be compact enough to fit in my briefcase, loud enough and clear enough to play in court, and had to have a counter so I could key sections of a transcript to a tape and easily locate the bits I wanted to play during a hearing. This little machine was cheap, and it does all that.I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because of one small issue. If you use headphones it only plays through one ear. Not a big deal, except it means headphones do nothing to improve the sound quality of a poor recording."
4,Good for the most part,"I'm able to record not only to the speakers, but I can hook a mircphone and do the same. Very functional - you'll find yourself easily using this when needed. Sony did good here!! Audio outlet and handle also are beneficial. Be sure not put volume too high when recording cause you may hear static/air in the background but not that much."
3,Some good Egyptian gods to stitch,"This book contains just enough good patterns of Egyptian gods, animals and a couple of cobras to make it worth the price. The patterns, however, are small, dark and hard to read. I will find it necessary to make enlarged copies and color them."
4,Nice for a beginning book on Egypt,"It seems that Egypt is ""in"" this season and this book is a good place to begin. There are some very simple designs plus some harder projects. This book is a nice and inexpensive place to begin."
5,Good,"this watch has analog and digital displays and has a stop watch with split time, tells when to go fishing, tells moon phases, three alarms, a timer, and dual time zones. If you don't like fishing, there is also a hunting model."
3,"Weak illumination, hard to program","I bought this watch as a replacement for a Casio Data bank. It looks and feels great however, it took a while to figure how to set time, date (digital first then analog) and it was irritating how long it took. I am usually the type of person that can figure this out without the book; but, with this watch you have to read the book carefully. Overall not a bad deal for inexpensive price."
2,Indeed mostly useless,"Alas a have to join the last reviewer in most of his remarks. Though I liked the Analemma part which was quite interesting and somewhat useful, there is nothing in it which would help you in navigating with a sextant. The rest is indeed a collection of noncoherent sentences and topics. Might be interesting for a child but my advice for everyone else interested in celestial navigation is buy a better book"
1,What happened to SK Tools?,"SK Tools used to be of the highest quality. The quality is gone, but it's not reflected in their price. The ratchet feels cheap and I do not expect it will have a long life. Embarassing quality for an American made tool!"
3,great sun shield,I bought this hat to take to Myrtle Beach. One side of it has black fabric and the other side is soft plastic. I could even wear it in the ocean! I wore it often and it still looks good. It's small and packs well in the suitcase. the curly-cord was comfortable. I feel that this was a good buy.
3,It's OK,Kinda cheap looking but will do in a pinch. You get what you pay for so I can't complain too much.
4,impress your lady friends,"came with worn out batteries .. otherwise worked fine, also the chain is kinda of filmsy"
4,Well Done Coffee Table Book,"If you are looking for design ideas that match Phillips Mediterrean and French looks, this is a good book. I collect many books on design and hers are well-illustrated. Additionally, they describe the manufacturers of the decorative items & fabrics. While some of the interiors she show are a little ""Dallas"" or Nouveau, overall they are filled with homes that appear well built with good materials and interior design. I would recommend this one."
2,French and Italian Styled Villas in TEXAS,"Sadly only three out of nearly 200 pages of photos inspired me. The few pictures that caught my attention had nothing to do with interior design. The style of the rooms were so bland. Though Philips showcased many homes throughout Texas, most shown had the same color scheme and no personality. I felt as though I were looking at the same home page after page. If you're looking for authentic French and Italian decor, you won't find it here.However this may be the perfect book for someone who lives in Texas (numerous resources listed in the back) and if your design aesthetic includes yellow painted walls with rooms furnished in dark mahogany wood."
4,Not for All,"Formal, grand, stark, traditionally European. However, perhaps more of a coffee table book, and not intended to inspire Americans looking for a quaint, rustic European style to immiate on a modest budget. I thought that some of the photos are old or out of date, but I think that most of these estates are so vast and expesively decorated that it may be decades/centuries before the decor changes. Anything but fadish or trendy."
5,Inspiration for Decorating,I purchased this book when I was updating my bathroom and I wanted a European feel to it. Looking at all the beautiful and high quality pictures in the book provided lots of inspiration.Even if you are not planning to decorate in the French or Italian style I would recommend this book. I found it help provide ideas on furniture placement and use of accessories. It even helped me pick what kind of faucets I would get for the sink. And there is a very nice section on gardens and outdoor rooms.
5,lumbar support,"Had a hard time finding this in the stores, so I found it at amazon. Quick shipping. Product is pretty straight forward and works well.I have a lumbar support built in my drivers seat but it wasn""t suppotive enough. I don""t use it around town only on long drives."
3,Deep lumbar roll,"I found the roll to be a little bit too deep for my purposes. Using my office chair the thickness of the roll has my whole spine pushed forward from the lumbar area a bit too much such that the rest of my spine does not contact the back of the chair easily. I also find that the strap does not secure the roll in one place, as it always slips down on the chair back. I would recommend getting a thinner roll unless your chair and back really need a very deep roll."
3,use of McKenzie D roll on computer chair,"Many times the D roll helps improve my sitting posture. However, after using the roll for long periods of time I become nauseous."
2,Would not recommend,"It definitely helped my back, but was too bulky for my work chair. Also, every time I got up it needed to be readjusted when I sat back down and that got annoying very quickly. It's currently living in my desk drawer."
2,Too bulky-returned,I meant to order the super roll but ordered this by accident. It is too bulky to sit comfortably and in a car pushes you too far forward. I returned it for the super roll which is much better!
2,didn't help,"good quality, but too thick, which makes it very uncomfortable to use. I did use it anyway, but it didn't help my back."
3,TOO BIG!!!,"If you weigh 400 lbs or just enjoy leaning your back over a barrel, this might be the right size for you. I cut out about 1 inch off the foam and that works about right. Probably should have bought the slimline."
2,Too Bulky,"Unfortunately, this Lumbar Roll was too bulky for me. It pressed into my spine, and I felt uncomfortable. I returned it. However, I did keep the McKenzie SlimLine Lumbar Support, which I had purchased at the same time as this one. It is much more comfortable, for me."
2,Too Much & Not Enogh,"I bought two of these, one for work & one for home; I wish I would've tried it out before buying both.The pad is too big(Glad I didn't buy the whole 'round' model), but my biggest complaint is the fact that the elasticized strap just doesn't cut it. It has no way of 'gripping' the chair, nothing to prevent the unit from sliding all the way down. It really should have 1 horizontal strap and at least one vertical strap so the height can be adjusted. I wouldn't recommend this until it's redesigned."
4,extremely helpful,"Have a blown L3/L4 and bulging L4/L5 and below. The roll made it possible for me to be able to drive to work (and not have to be crawling into the office in horrible pain) and then to remain at work (with appropriate breaks) during the day. I especially liked the flat side, as it did not tend to shift around in my chair(s) as much as the totally round roll. Was recommended to get one of these by my physical therapist, glad I did."
4,"This product works, though not for all chairs","This is a beneficial product. It appears to work great. The only problem is that it won't fit any of my desk or lounge chairs. If I had a chair it fits things would be different. However, I have used it effectively to sleep with at night."
2,Costly product and not for use in car,"After I bought it I found that there are several similar product much cheaper. Also you cannot use in car and the band only is not sufficient to keep the roll in place and facing the curve straight. After you use it in the car, the cushion moves inside the outer cover completely messing up.Only good thing about this product is that cushion does not lose shape even after long useNot worth the price."
5,Great product,"For anyone with low back or other back pain, which is aggravated by prolonged sitting, the McKenzie D-Section Lumbar roll is a great product. Because of the elastic straps, it can be moved up or down in the chair to support the area of back pain. It is also portable so that it can be used in a vehicle as well. I like the fact that is is a ""D"" shape as opposed to a circular roll. I also like the fact that it has a washable cover. It certainly has relieved my back pain and supported my back. I recently had back surgery, and while I am healing, I use the Lumbar Roll just above my incision area which allows back support and yet does not put pressure on the surgical site itself."
2,Nice Support for a Short Time.,I ordered the Original McKenzie D-Section #700 Lumbar Roll Because I plan a long road trip soon and I have no lumbar support adjustment on my SUV's driver seat. It was simple to install using the attached strap and gave instant support to my lumbar area of my back but after a very short time the density of the foam started to break down and soon I found I had an expensive squashed piece of foam that didn't support half as well as when it was new.So back to the rolled up towel that at least never loses it's density.
3,Bulkier than I expected,"This product is good quality and I like that it attaches to the chair, but it's much bigger than I expected. I'm an average sized female (currently pregnant) and I find that in my office chair this pushes me way too far forward and is very uncomfortable. In my husband's car it works a bit better, but still feels pretty big.If you're a medium-small sized woman I'd suggest trying the petite/slimline model instead. I haven't used that one myself, but something smaller is definitely needed for me."
1,Money down the drain,"I should have known better! I instinctively thought ""what a stupid looking pillow"" when i first saw this and I should have gone with my gut. But NO...based on the other reviews, I went ahead and ordered the damn thing. Not only that, but when it arrived, I ripped open the packaging, cut the tags off and started using it, thereby negating the return option.For starters, the strap is cheesy and useless - no matter how much you tighten it, the pillow does not stay in place. It is very poorly designed. Then there is the issue of the shape of the pillow...this is not a pillow that complements the natural curve of the spine by any stretch of the imagination.On the up side (and the reason I gave it a star), it can be used as a neck rest pillow, even though I already have one those and what I really wanted was a BACK PILLOW!!!"
2,Not firm enough,The material of this cushion is too soft. A good lumbar support must have solid firmness. I would not recommend this product
2,"too big, and needs constant readjustment","I'm a 5'4"" woman, and this is way too large for me. My back can't touch the rest of my chair when this is attached! The strap is flimsy and slides around on my desk chair. The foam piece rotates within the cover, so I have to keep on taking it out to reposition it. This product might work better for a much larger person who owns a chair with fuzzy upholstery."
4,decent,"I don't know what to say. It is a decent CD. All I can say is that if you really like techno (real techno, not the sell out stuff), then get this CD."
1,dosen't work!!,"should have not bought it! i reinstall several times, tried several pc's, the same problem! the window opens and the closes in a flash second, the PlayStation version is good but the PC version sucks!!!"
1,Completely biased English author,"Dale's book is great, if you're British. In the sections on political scandals he mentions Bill Clinton but not Henry the VIII. He tells about all of Dicken's characters, but nothing on Mark Twain. Dale touches briefly on American people of importance, nothing on anyone in other countries, and the rest of the folks are British. But nothing on Harry Potter. So unless you're a Britophile or like to knowing obscure British facts, don't waste your time."
5,excellent introduction by an unsurpassed scholar,"Schacht still remains a towering figure in the study of Islamic Law even after ~50 yrs., and his introduction gives you the ideal figure figure as a guide. This work is not just a simplistic review of Islamic law, but it is also a work of scholarship. While it is unfortunate that his most important work, ON MUHAMMADAN JURISPRUDENCE, is no longer in print, this work serves as a good alternative and even a much more readable entry point to this field of scholarship."
3,Not bad,"This book is a little dated but it still remains an interesting read non the less. Schacht also wrote ""On Muhammadan Jurisprudence"" of which there is an critical editon by Professor Azami published by the Islamic Text Society as to say the least, there are a number of faults with both that book and this one.The book does however cover the four schools of Sunni Islam as best it can and makes a decent attempt to provide the reader with at least a basis to study an extreamly complex and misunderstood leagal system.Worth a read but read with caution."
3,Lost in the translation,"""Carnival of Monsters"" is another landmark in Who history, as it marks the Third Doctor's return to time travel after two seasons stranded on Earth. Viewers were rewarded with a witty script that managed to overcome the shoddiness of its special effects budget.The novelization tries to copy the broadcast, but doesn't really capture the humor of the performances. This was Pertwee at his best; even Jo worked well. Too bad it doesn't all make it to the page."
5,Thank you E.T. Davis for sharing a piece of your soul...,"Not many black men are able to be totally honest with themselves in expressing their pain and anger. This author has taken that which can control him, learned from it and has grown through acceptance. I applaud your courage and your strength. I will surely share this one with a few lost souls along the way."
4,"Anger, Acknowledgement, and Acceptance (Blatant Honesty)",A book that evokes an entire spectrum of emotions. This is a book of poetry that is written from the heart and soul therefore it can touch hearts and souls. I enjoyed reading and re-reading the poems in this book.
5,This CD goes into the time capsule!,"Rise and Shine is a clever masterpiece, with the essence of Ziggy Stardust. This CD moves me, takes me to a better place. It's great to hear the future of music. It's strong lyrics and musical movement make this CD a classic."
2,Too short and too simple...,"The main message of this book is that we should examine the process by which fear works within us. Unfortunately, we are not told how to do this. The author believes it is different for everyone. I might have been able to overlook this, but this was the _only_ practical advice given in the book.I thought the handwritten format of the book was nice to look at, but it is actually rather deceptive because it camouflages the fact that the book is very short - both in words and advice. It takes about 30 minutes to read the whole thing, and you may well end up feeling like you didn't get anything out of it.Save your money and check this one out at the library. The brevity and lack of insight don't make it a wise purchase."
5,A must read book,"A friend loaned me her copy of this book because my fears were preventing me from exploring new experiences in my life. It helped me so much that I bought a copy to use as a reminder when I needed it. I thought my fear was real. After I read this book, I started to see through my fears which allows me to pursue activities and experiences that I desire. Her teaching is simple and understandable. If fear is stopping you from something you desire, read this book."
1,An empty book,"This book says nothing. It is diffuse and confusing. We do not get a clear explanation about the origins of fears, neither a clear way to surpass them. The paper that goes to books like this is a waste of forest trees and the time it takes to read them is also wasted."
1,I can't believe it,i am an experienced trader. if you use the method in this book be prepared to lose huge amounts of money. i doubt that the trading record touted by the author is factual. the goal of this book as far as i can tell is not to impart knowledge to the buyer but to sell books for the author. save your money and buy books written by reputable authorschris
1,Author is a Thief,He will take your money and never deliver the site. His coding and design is 10 years old. Don't waste your money on his book and NEVER wire him money to the UK.
3,Just not enough,"As informative as this book is, I've found that it doesn't cover much in detail. It brushes against the fundamentals, but lacks a more in-depth guide for advanced developers.I also found the index and appendixes very difficult to utilize when looking for specific functions. It would have been nice to find ALL references to what I needed and not just the appendix 'definition'.It's a good starting point for beginners, but advanced users might find it a bit frustrating."
5,Jeff Hamilton Trio--Best Things Happen.,"I found this by accident--what luck!!! I was looking for a vocal rendition of ""Poinciana,"" and this Jeff Hamilton CD came up. Everything I have with drummer Hamilton is very classy, and the tracks listed appealed to me, so I took a chance on it. You win some, you lose some. What a winner this is! Terrific pianist in Tamir Hendelman, who was previously unknown to me. Of course, no vocal of Poinciana, but a stunning arrangement, as one comes to expect of Hamilton from his LA4 days. I guess you would call this jazz, but it is in fact just plain amazing, attention-grabbing listening. The arrangements preserve the integrity of the great melodies included, yet the artists' originality is always evident. Hendelman is a revelation. His solos are gorgeous, and manage to stay in the mood of the songs while bending them this way and that. One of the luckiest finds ever!!!"
1,Stay away from this product!,"My radio worked fairly well for about a year. The main problem was that the display was hardly visible in the car during daylight hours. You could see it fine after dark.Now, however there is NO display on my unit. The radio still plays, but you can no longer use the menu or change settings since there is no longer a visible display. You also have no way of knowing what station you are listening to unless the DJ identifies it. I will now have to replace this radio with a different brand. SIRIUS is great but this receiver was not."
1,Do not buy- Junk,"Same problems as below. Bottom connector problems, have to use my childrens ponytails to try to keep the connection tight. Now it doesn't even work in the boombox. Would have to pay to ship it to be repaired-forget it."
1,"junk, absolute junk","i have now gone through 2 crsr-10 receivers, simply because i have the boombox and carkit for that model. i will now be purchasing a whole different car kit and boombox. i have broken 2 of these in 3 months because the bottom connector doesn't have the strength a portable device needs. two units, broken in the same exact spot. very highly disappointed in the product to say the least."
2,not worth it,"thought we were upgrading from the old orbiter mobile kit and gaining a home kit too but this sanyo receiver only looks better. There is no dock to speak of, so you must unplug the unit from your car or home manually: unplug power, antenna, audio plugs etc...time consuming when you are in a hurry and just want to store the unit to prevent theft. the home kit is limited since I was told that my receiver antenna had to be on the north side of my house (my stereo is on the south side and the antenna does not reach). If you want a longer cord it will cost you $30. have you ever heard of a radio antenna having to face a certain side of your house directly in front of the window? they should assume that the antenna needs to be installed on the roof and give you a longer cord....."
1,"Misleading, couldn't supply","I ordered this unit and waited almost 3 weeks before I had to get in contact with the supplier. I received conformation that the unit WAS SENT. This however didn't turn out to be the case. I was informed that they could not supply me this radio. I waited 30 day to find this out. So the process starts again in hope that the next merchant will make good on the advertised item being offered. Nothing wrong with the unit, I already have one, but the merchant should not be selling through Amazon. Not happy."
1,Worst purchase ever!,"Seemed like a good deal but after having this for a few months it has failed. Turns on and off without getting a signal. Seems to be a common issue with the design. By far the worst electronics purchase I have made in my life and truly a negative in an otherwise positive satellite radio experience. I wouldn't take a free replacement from Sanyo if they offered me one... Yes, it is that bad."
2,"Worked great for quite a while, then......","I had the unit for close to 2 years, with absolutely no problems. About a month ago it went bad. Unit will no longer start up consistently. If the unit does come on- it can not be turned off and restarted without allowing it to cool off, for an extended period of time. Explored trying to get the unit repaired, but figure the cost will be close to a new unit of different make. Would like to think that it should have lasted longer than two years, but from the other reviews, it sounds like I was lucky it made it that long."
1,The worst...no kidding,Long story short...first radio defective...replacement sent by Sirius is also defective...now Sirius claims 4-6 week delay before shipping a replacement...there is a serious problem with the connector ports...the signal keeps dropping out...The controls are difficult to operate. Do NOT purchase this product at ANY price...
2,"Frank Chin, the bitter broken record","I read this book because I liked Donald Duk, which was required for one of my literature classes. This book here recycled everything from Donald Duk. But instead of focusing on the valid discourse surrounding the ethnic appropriation of history, he bashes other writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston (using tired arguments - right or not, we already get it!) and tells people explicitly what what he thinks is crap or not in writing, but based only on a paranoid fear of being a stereotypical, effeminate Chinese. I did not enjoy reading it, but no one who does can be left with any doubts as to where Frank Chin stands. Which would be no problem if he either had said something new or had said expanded upon his previous valid ideas. This book is simply a rant, and undermines his previous work. Please read Donald Duk instead."
3,ranting to the max,"I could not get through this book. Seriously. 400 PAGES!If you cannot handle reading his plays or reading the much shorter Donald Duk, then don't attempt this one. It is more of his ramblings to the Nth degree. He's a big proponent of knowing the mythology and folklore of your ancestral culture, so that you have a resilient sense of identity to survive the onslaught of a Western society that emasculates Asian men.It's a profound and useful idea for people of color. my beef with this book and his fiction in general is that his writing style is that of a mad man rambling and ranting. he's a mad man who is absolutely correct. but a mad man nonetheless.I much, much prefer his essays. They are far more clear, and yet they still have some profound insights into the state of Asian America, even today. Do yourself a favor and look up the essay ""Racist Love"" and start there.Frank, put your essays in an anthology and publish that."
2,OK but,Very nice. My wife loved it up until the second week when (still alto left) it stop spraying. Wouldn't buy it again because of that.
4,Liked it,Love Marilyn. This was a good doc and it was nice to see her in candid moments and speaking off screen.
3,Ok...,"This was ok. I had to wait an extra week after receiving the DVD though, because the product came in terrible condition. It was packaged in a flimsy envelope, and the DVD itself comes in a cardboard cover. Needless to say, the DVD was scratched and would stop after 8 minutes. But as a Marilyn fan, I liked the DVD. Could of been a bit longer/ more detailed, but all in all, not bad."
2,"great pictures, not a story","I didn't enjoy reading this and my kids, 4 and 9 didn't seem to enjoy it either. The pictures are beautiful and you can talk to your kids about a story as you look at the pictures, but the actual narrative part of this story is simply a list of car names and places. It is not captivating or interesting and tells no story to follow along with. If you like illustrations however, you will still get some enjoyment out of a very well illustrated book.My son is an absolute train nut. Much more enjoyable reading books include the ""Little Red Train"" series, ""Steam Smoke and Steel"", ""Chugga Chugga Choo Choo"" and even the sliding ""Freight Car"" Board book."
1,Great illustrations but no story...,"My 5 year old son loves trains and train books but says this book is ""boring"" (and I have to agree). I think he finds it confusing. Rather than a story (with a beginning, middle & end) this book lists train car names one page says ""Phoebe Snow, B&O, Thirty-four, five""."
5,Fabulous illustrations...,"My 4 year old son and I stumbled across this book in the library and I immediately knew we had to have our own copy. The poem that constitutes the text of this book is simple and timeless. The illustrations are breathtaking. Each painting depicts the same train at the crossing, the various townspeople waiting at the crossing and the contents of the freight cars. My son loves inventing 'conversations' between the people waiting for the train to pass. A lovely book that is a nice addition to any child's library."
3,Just what I needed,This product is well made and was perfect for my needs. I have not noticed any kinking of the hose yet!
3,Kinkless?,"I bought this based on it's ""kinkless"" design. It is a well made hose, light, and has good brass fittings. But it will kink, but the kink does not stay permanently or appear to damage the hose in any way. I guess it's a matter of what the word means. We live in the southwest, and the hose is exposed to lots of solar radiation. This Apex hose replaces a 15 year old Swan, that still had a sound jacket, but was essentially collapsed from multiple kinks. We hope it holds up as long as the Swan did, but does not kink permanently."
1,warning,DO NOT BUY THIS HOSE IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A HOSE THAT DOES NOT KINK !! THIS HOSE KINKS AS BAD OR WORSE THAN ANY I HAVE EVER OWNED.
2,"This Hose Should be called ""Sometimes Kinks"".",I have bought less costly hoses that perform better. I was disappointed in this product.Don't Reccommend. I will stick with the rubber instead.
4,NeverKink extra heavy duty hose,"This is workhorse hose. Although there is no such thing as a never kink hose, this comes pretty close to it."
4,Tough,I haven't used this hose much or for very long. I figure that it will work out OK once it uncurls. So far it has been not wanted to do this.
3,"Good quality hose, but very stiff","A very stiff, extra heavy duty hose. Most customers would be happier with the series 2000 heavy duty NeverKink hose, which does kink on occasion but is very flexible and easy to use and store on a hose holder. But when I bought the series 3000 (11-23-08) it was only $25 and they wanted $41 for the series 2000 (go figure!). I give this one 5 stars for durability but only 2 stars for usability; 3 stars overall. (The 2000 series rates 4 stars for both durability and usability.)"
4,Very good hose.,"I've had this hose for about 2 months now. Just as advertised, the hose does not kink, which is the main feature I was looking for. It looks well-built and so far I really have no complains. Amazon is asking me to rate it, so I give it 4 stars, as I still have not had it long enough to see how it performs in cold weather as well as extreme sun exposure.Good deal for the price."
3,"""NeverKink"" should be ""EverKink""","I purchased this hose to replace a much less expensive one which my son hit with a lawn mower. While I was winding it on the the hose reel, this hose kinked three times... and when this hose kinks it leaves a permanent crease. This product should be called the ""never let it kink cause if you do you'll be hosed"" hose. Next time I will go with a much less expensive hose."
5,great Product!,"Very Sturdy, good size, both my cats (10 & 9lbs) can fit if necessary for local trips to vet. And best of all it has wheels and will fit under plane seat!"
4,pet carrier,"This sherpa bag made carrying my 17 lb. cat to the vet so much easier. He wasn't happy being dragged through the streets of NYC, but I was...and he's just a cat."
3,Tipsey Wheels,I purchased this due to my Ragdoll cats weight of 18 pounds(a common size for his breed). Many times in its first use it shifted position throwing the carrier on its side and not remaining on it's wheels until manually righted.This is most disconcerting and certainly defeats the purpose and upsets my cat. My cat is used to my other non wheeled Sherpa carrier I have enjoyed before my cat reached his full mature weight.He understandably became upset when upended on his side.The carrieralso does not have any outside pockets for incidentals(as the other Sherpa does)which has proved to be a rather serious inconvenience. All in all I would not recommend this product and wish I had purchased another brand of carrier.
1,"Too small, tips over",Bought this for my 11 lb. cat to travel by air. It easily tips over while being pulled and is very heavy to carry (since I gave up on pulling it along). It barely fit under the (American) airline seat without being squished a bit. I bought the medium size which is supposed to accomodate a pet up to 16 pounds. I would not recommend this carrier at all. Not worth the price. I would love to remove the wheels but haven't figured out how to do this.
2,would not purchase,First time using this piece and the zipper on one of the compartments is broken. The duffle is on its way to Japan' otherwise I would certainly be returning it. Certainly would not purchase anything by this manufacturer again
1,Poorly designed dog carrier on wheels,"This product did not meet my my expectations. If my dog's weight was not evenly distributed, the bag did not roll. I would not recommend or by this product again. I was very disappointed"
3,Tips over,It is fun to walk with his head sticking out and seeing everyone! But if you walk quickly it tips over!
5,A Great Box Set at a Great Price,"This is a great box set. Sure, the design with DVDs over each other is not ideal and can make getting the volume you want tricky, but for this price its worth it. I actually got this box set a few years ago when I was broke and was so happy to see that the price was manageable as this is one of my favorite series. As other reviews have said, it doesn't have all the special features, or really anything that die-hard fans might be itching for, but its still well worth the price to have all of season one."
3,Good book,This was a pretty good book. I didnt really like that it talked a lot about her kids. Overall it was a good story
5,Most used item in my kitchen!,I received these as a gift from my best friend and now use them daily. I never knew these existed before. She knew I ate organic grapefruit daily and bought this set for me.I LOVE these spoons! They look great and do the job so well. I am ordering four more today as a matter of fact. I have to thank Alison for introducing these to me. All of her gifts to me have been so useful and appreciated.I highly recommend these spoons.- Jennifer
2,not the greatest,"The spoon parts works as needed, but the handles were so thin they were hard to hold when dipping out the grapefruit sections."
5,Grapefruit Lover??,I've always loved grapefruit but hated sectioning them. My husband laughed when I told him I had ordered these spoons. He thought I was wasting my time and money. The spoons are shaped perfectly for taking out the sections and Now we both can enjoy using them. Once he used them he changed his mind. We think they're great.
4,Very useful utensil,We have a very productive grapeful tree that bears a lot of delicious pink grapefruits. Good grapefruit spoons are not easy to find in the stores. The Global set of four spoons are reasonably priced and have served us well. We are glad that these are available through Amazon.
3,Practical but not pretty,These are practical and work really well for what they are designed to do and they were reasonably priced. We are generally pleased with this purchase.
2,grapefruit spoons,I have purchased grapefruit spoons many times in the past. These are not enjoyable to use because the serration is too much of an area around the spoon. One would like to have just enough to remove one bite and not feel uncomfortable when then eating.
2,Lousy spoons,"I was very disatisfied with these spoons. The bowl is very narrow and won't pull out an entire section of larger grapefruits. It leaves a swipe of pulp on either side of the membrane. Also the handle is pitiful. This spoon is the length of a regular teaspoon (I measured it against one of mine) but the handle is very skinny so it's difficult to hold. The end of it stabbed my palm as I tried to use it to dig into the grapefruit to pull out the half section I could get. I ended up returning them. On a good note, return shipping was free because I used Amazon as the seller."
1,might as well get a regular spoon,These were a complete waste of money. They don't seem to do any better of a job than the regular spoon I was using before I got them.
2,flimsy spoons,"In a nutshell, these spoons are not very sturdy. They bend WAY too easily... I would wager they would even bend while scooping out a stubborn wedge of grapefruit. The only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because they have a nice polished finish and are attractive to look at. Not recommended."
5,Good grapefruit spoons,These spoons did not scrape my lips as some I had did. I recommend these spoons to those who love to dig out all the grapefruit and juice like I do. These spoons work great!
5,does the job,Good product that does what they are supposed to. Comfortable to eat with and a good weight.
5,Perfect!!,"These are exactly what I was looking for. The shape is perfect. Pointy enough, but not too pointy. Cut easily, but are easy on your mouth. Very nice quality."
4,Good product with thin handles,The product is what is says and I have no complaints. The one observation is that with the thin handles it takes a little more effort to maneuver the spoon around the grapefruit wedge.
5,The only grapefruit spoon worth owning.....,"I have owned a set of four of these spoons for the past three years and could never find a place that carried them again...until now! They are the only grapefruit spoon that really does the job. I even carry them when I travel (during grapefruit season) as no other will do. Now, if we could just get them ""Made in USA"", I would be even happier...."
5,Good value for the money,"These spoons are shaped a bit oddly, but they work fine. The shape does make it easier to dig out the grapefruit, though they take a bit of getting used to. The set was quite inexpensive, and the spoons clearly are not top-quality, but they are of reasonably good, serviceable quality. I'm very happy with the purchase, and my 10-year-old, who uses them the most, concurs."
4,Vegetable seasoning like all Prudhomme seasonings is great.,Paul Prudhomme makes great seafood seasoning and pork and veal seasoning. I found the Vegetable Seasoning to also be very good.
2,A Phone To Avoid,"I have had this phone for almost 2 months and I'm very unhappy with it. The battery life is horrible. I have to charge the phone at least once a day and I barely use it. Just leaving it on seems to suck the battery life right out of it. There is an extended life battery available but it only adds another hour. Besides the very short battery life, the phone gets so hot after 3 minutes of talking on it. It's almost too hot to hold. The camera isn't great either and I definitely wouldn't recommend this phone if you're going to take a lot of photos. The quality is poor and if you don't hold perfectly still you will get a blurry photo. I wish I never bought this phone."
2,Don't Buy!,"I had the phone for 14 days before I returned it!-Call quality was terrible-Signal strength was poor in areas where I had great signal withthe previous phone-The phone heated up on the menu button during calls over 5 minutes. It got so hot that it was actually uncomfortable to hold it to your face--not hot enough to burn, but still not pleasant!-Camera funcions were hard to use and slowSpend a few more dollars and buy a different phone!"
2,This Phone can be Useful,I have had this phone for 3 months.Good Features are:1. Text messenging2. Camera3. Phone Rept.BAD FEATURES:1. Battery sucks2. Pone will ring on every event went u dont want it too3. Phone Rept. Sucks most of the timeSo I would say not to buy this phone..Unless u want to charge it everynight.
1,Stupid topic stupid book,"I don't understand why anyone would want to write a book on a rogue army that has always suffered defeat,humiliation and abused human rights.The pakistan army murdered 3 million innocent bangladeshis in 1971 in the worst genocide of the 21st century.The pakistan army is one of the most poorly trained and undisciplined armies in the world.Rapes and murders are a plenty.The army brings shame to pakistan."
1,Poorly done work,"A very boring and irritating analysis of one of the world's most poorly trained and un-professional armies.Up there in the list of armies who can get the job done are the United states,UK,India etc Unfortunately the Pakistan army needed to do a genocide against the poor Bangaldeshis(3 million is not something to be ignored) to get some attention but that only resulted in their doom at the hands of the Indian army.The positive proof that the pakistan army is one of the world's worst is their employment of Mujahideen who are in fact,better trained and motivated.This book can mislead people as well as force the average pakistani to turn his view towards the military instead of concentrating on food,education,employment etc.It's about time the pakistanis forget about their failed military and take up other duties for their own welfare."
1,one face of a coin,"Writing Books Great! but history, boy, you need to dig down[indian perspective]. Who is the enemy ? pakistan ? nope. britan, nope. TIME. India / Pak / Bangla was one country-Bharat. split by the brits[divide & rule], instigated by Jinnah, neighbours fought with one another. hell, we won independence by non violence. but terrorism ? we believe in karma.. I would still love to see pak / india as one country, but it is only me. PS:1> how capable do you think is UN, in understanding all this. 2> time cannot be rolled back. this is an issue, between 2 friends turned enemies, and can only be settled mutually. no third element can understand or relate to this, especially writers like you."
2,"Bogged down in authors passions, book offers little","The book is disappointing in more ways than one. Although the author is a known India basher, one had hoped that in the twilight of his career, the author would offer a book aimed at a wide audience. Clearly, the book aims merely at Pakistani readers fed on the nation's official history. That is a tragedy, since an old partisan of South Asian affairs could probably have made some contribution to our understanding of Pakistan and its army.Alas, for that the global reader must await another book."
3,Quite Readable,"This is quite an interesting book, though, not quite recommendable. I do find author's account of military conflicts quite accurate. In my view it is important to give out details of military formations - divisions, corp.'s etc, which some people have objected to. The numbers give you a feel of the strenght of the troops and the structure of forces.Author's contemptuous attitude towards politicians in general and Indian politicians in particular was quite irksome. His fondness of Pakistani Generals in spite of their flaws also begs reason. In authors view sending of regular and irregular troops in 1999 over to Indian side was an aberration. I would like to point out that it is the third time it has happened in a short span of 50 years. It seems more like a pattern.Mr. Cloughley recommendations on structure of armed forces were interesting and though provoking."
2,Propoganda,"Brian Cloughley falls into that category of ""experts"" who happily serve as mouthpieces for the Pakistan Army. He is neither an expert on South Asia, nor a scholar, and his book is not an objective attempt to examine the Pakistan Army.Given his own history, and the volume of his editorials in Pakistani newspapers, where he has ever shown himself ready to defend Pakistan and its Army against any and all criticism, as well as promote the Army's opinion that its control of Pakistan is superior to any rule by politicians or mere ""civilians"", the contents of his books should be examined from the perspective that this is how the Pakistan Army views itself and would like others to see it.For a much better, but still sympathetic treatment, of the Pakistan Army look toPakistan Army."
1,Doesn't work with ''windows xp'',I have got the damn game at home and I tried installing Direct X 5 and that takes it off. IT'S USELESS!
3,Good books and a good television series.,I also have a two-book set of this Robert Graves product. Seeing it here has prompted me to read them over again. I also saw the TV series when it was first broadcast on Public Televison from Buffalo. I recommend both the books and the series.
3,why is the shingle guide optional?,"I've been looking at this tool at the local hardware store for months. I don't know how to get the optional shingle guide. The twin model(nv45abk) comes with the shingle guide attached, but it weighs almost twice as much. Why make a shingle nailer without the guide? This tool is so light weight and comfortable that if there were directions or an address as to where to obtain the shingle guide I would probably buy it."
3,Very simple unit,"Nothing extra... Pitch control is useless as it has no voice fix feature and everything sounds like a chipmonk or like they came from outer space. Does not have basic effects such as scratch, zoom and etc. The contols are nice and easy to understand, however has a vey annoying feature of stopping the CD when you cross fade to another CD... Has only two channels (I am used to four channels) comes with really short cables so plan to buy extension cords for everything, power and you music cord. The wheels are useless as they really needed except to rewind a song... Also the CD player is very sensitive and skips at any CD imperfections... I would not recommend this for a Pro, but good for a beginner."
3,Fancy coloring book - meh,"Despite the colorful exterior, the text is all black and white. This item could be described as a work text, but even that would be charitable. For example, the words for the state song are listed, but there is no hint as to what the melody is. The state flag is presented with a paragraph describing the flag with directions to color the Ohio flag below. Other pages have instructions to color but no real directions. What colors are the state seal, anyway? This book seems more of an advertisement for the author's web site than a presenter of helpful information."
1,Got Screwed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"They over sold this product so i didn't get them, then they tried to make up for it by offering to sell me the worlds ugliest shoe."
5,Amazing Quality for Low Price,"These binoculars are almost identical to the Eagle Ranger binoculars that I already own, but at half the price. I am really impressed with the quality of the image I can see through these binoculars. They are heavier than the Eagle Rangers, which does make a big difference if you are wearing them around your neck all day. But a binocular harness is included when you order these binos, which is a really nice touch. It's great that Zhumell has opened up the world of high quality optics to people who would never spend $400 for a similar product. These also come with a lifetime no-fault repair/replace guarantee, same as the very expensive products. Since these are still new, I don't yet know how well they'll hold up to wear and tear, but there are no obvious quality issues. I would highly recommend this product."
5,Delicous Onion Soup Mix!,"Forget going to the store and paying a holy fortune for a box of Lipton with 2 envelopes in it. This is much less expensive and just as good. I use it in meat loaf, meatballs, gravy and once just for soup. It is wonderful. I'm sold on it. You will like it, too, I'm sure."
5,A suprise!,"Having grown up in Louisiana, when I received this book as a gift I was sceptical that I'd find anything interesting or new in it. But what a suprise! Variations on the classic fare (gumbo, jambalaya, etouffee, etc)as well as recipes that seem inspired by our native ingredients such as sweet potato soup proved me wrong. The photographs are beautiful, and the recipes I've tried work."
3,"2"" D-ring binder (dark blue)",Very sturdy binder - I wanted to order more but the price jumped a short while after I received this -
2,No room for God,"After whetting my appetite on some good books on this subject I found this one disappointing. Right from the beginning the author suggests that organized religions are a scam and Jesus can't be trusted. However, we are to believe that unborn babies routinely wait for the correct configuration of the planets before allowing their births to occur."
3,Only for die-hard fishing fans,"This game takes some time to get used to.It took nearly 4 hours before we finally got a fish, which makes it difficult to go back and play. The Blue Marlin section was more fun and it was easier to get a fish on, but the Bass section seemed to take forever before you got a single strike, not exciting or fun if you are not a die-hard fisherman."
4,Good Fishing,"I haven't played This game.. but have played then separately... I Loved Blue Marlin, it was a blast from the start..and Balck bass is harder,,but if you are a fisherman and apply the right techniques... well u WILL be rewarded!!"
2,Didn't MPRESS me Much!,This album has only two tracks I enjoyed!1. Maybe&2. Something 'bout the WayThose are the only songs I enjoyed on this whole album!
2,molly age 18,"These people can sing good. But I don't like all the dumb pop sounds. It ruins the songs. Also I feel like a 10 yr old when I listen to it. its just kinda that type of pop music. But adults can like it too if thats what they like.I kinda wished I hadn't have spent the money to buy it. The only song I like is Suddenly.Also Don't you go is a good song, but I don't get why they say,""little boy i still love you"" in the song. I am giving it 2 stars for effort, good singing abilities. I tried to like this album.I like songwriters. I bought this album, knowing that they said that they want to do some of their own songwriting on their next album.If you like ""same as same pop, then you would like this cd."
4,Don't Pay That Much Money For This,I don't have this CD but I do have the regular one that costs a lot less and it isn't that awesome. I suggest you try that one first.
3,Give it anther chance,"Ok, I will admit that at first listen, this album does not really stand out. There wasn't a song that jumped out at me or that I wanted to hear again...but after a few times I realized that as a whole this CD is pretty good. I highly suggest for anyone to listen to ""Ain't the One,"" ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,"" and, my personal working out/getting ready to go out favorite, ""What You Do to Me."" I listen to all genres of music and I know the reputation that Pop muic has, one of being frivolous,and I agree with that to an extent although some music is just about having fun. And as a plus, these girls can actually sing, as in hold notes...a lot more than what some other current top popstars can do."
5,Every kid should read Ramona,"I read Beverly Cleary when I was a girl, and now I read it to my daughter. These books are time-proof, as relevant and true and funny today as they every were. No pauses to explain ""that's how it used to be"" - and how nice to read a book with no passages written in text-speak for a change. Ramona books are for real kids, full of funny quirks and self-doubt and bouts of meanness, and guilt and joy."
5,Beverly Cleary Ramona Collection,This purchase of volumes one through eight for our 8yr old granddaughter for Christmas is what we hope to be the successful start to the series.
3,"Decent Purchase, But Mis-Represented","The three star rating comes from a discrepancy in the marketing of the product. It is marketed as being 18/10 stainless steel, but is really made out of a non-magnetic alloy, most likely some form of aluminum. This explains the low price.Otherwise a fine boat, although the spoon has a tendency to flop around a bit due to a high center of gravity relative to the pivot point."
2,Only choice...,I bought this saucer because my mother had a similar one when I was little.I searched high and low for a round stainless steel saucer with attached base.This is the only one out there.I didn't use it much - maybe 6 or 7 times and the base fell off....Would not buy again.JD
5,This book is wonderful,"As an intern in internal medicine, it is very useful to have quick, easy to read, resources available. This book serves as the best reference guide that I have found for the million daily questions posed in rounds and clinics.I also found the series a vital addition for the review of specialities for USMLE step 2 and 3."
1,Not my cup of tea,"I tried to find out the ingredient list before I purchased this seasoning. I went to Paul's website and it didn't list the ingredients. It said this: Salmon Magic(tm), Chef Paul's newest creation, is a unique blend of carefully selected herbs and spices with subtle accents of dry mustard seeds.After I received it the first ingredient listed was Sugar. My problem is that I don't like sweet tasting food unless it's a dessert. I tried to like it but I could hardly get through dinner. If you like your food on the slightly sweet side it will probably be fine for you.P.S. I really like his Seafood and Blackened Redfish Magic."
3,Hard Hat Harry? Really?,I wish this were more like the I Love Airplanes movie. They intro the airplane and then just show it. The interaction with Hard Hat Harry and the kids was painful to watch. My little guy would rather watch Hx channel type helicopter shows.
4,Hard Hat Harry is great!,My son loves Hard Hat Harry. He's been watching it for the past two years (he's almost 5) and doesn't seem to be getting bored with it. He's learning things without even knowing it!
5,I think Stay the same is a great song.This cd is great.,"I wish you lived around this area. Anyways, your song really is great!This cd is wonderful. I would recommend everyoen to get this. Stay the same is a good song with a great meaning to it. You always had my support and always will."
3,A solid effort from little Joey,"The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it. I think Mr. McIntyre is still fine tuning his great voice and he does some solid vocal work on this CD. DANNY WOOD and DONNY WAHLBERG are mentioned as part of the production staff for this project. The three former New Kids have produced a solid album here. Standouts include GIVE IT UP, I LOVE YOU CAME TOO LATE, WE CAN GET DOWN and the soulful WITHOUT YOU LOVE."
5,Joey McIntyre's STAY THE SAME cd was great!!!,"You can hear the effort that was put into this album. The coolest thing is that when you stick the cd into the cd-rom of your computer!!! You can watch the ENITRE ""STAY THE SAME"" video in the comfort of your own computer! I deffinately recommend this to anybody who is considering buying the cd!"
5,it`s great.,it`s great and joey has a good voice.I never listen NKOTB before coz I was little.Now I hear Stay The Same and it`s really graet and makes me crazy.I`ll not miss him if he comes to my town.lastly it`s cool.
3,Does it bother anyone else that he's known as 'Joey?',"I haven't purchased the new album (I got the Bowen Arrow album from Joe in December) so perhaps this won't be a fair assessment, but overall I'd have to say I'm not blown away by Joe's first solo attempt. The album does have its moments with ""Stay the Same,"" ""The Way,"" ""I Cried"" (no one I know likes this one but I love it!), and ""Without Your Love,"" but I think it's a little too New Kid-sy to work nowadays. I'm positive, however, that with a little practice he'll get better. My REAL problem, as my summary states, is that he's going by 'Joey.' It just doesn't seem right that someone trying to prove he's matured is using the name 'Joey.' I realize he's said he doesn't care what he's called as long as people listen to his CD, but I gotta think the name might turn some people away from listening. But that's just my opinion. Oh, and 'Bababooey:' before you call anyone ignorant, perhaps you could go back to first grade and learn how to spell?"
2,disappointing,"I had high expectations for this cd...I really did. What I got was a disappointment. There were some songs that I couldn't listen to without cringing...the words were very cliche. His voice has definately matured, however his lyrics haven't.McIntyre keeps re-iterating that this cd will be a departure from his old New Kids days...but while listening to this cd I got distinct New Kids flashbacks. (And I should know, I was fanatic about them years ago!)The album has a few good points...the songs ""I Cried"" and ""I Love You Came too Late"" I think were my favorite, as well as ""Stay the Same."""
2,disappointing material,"I've been a fan of Joe's since back in the New Kid days and I was very excited about his solo album. However, the type of music on this debut was less than inspiring and didn't offer anything new. I've been to a recent full-length concert of his and it was fun to bop around to his new songs during the performance, but his is not a CD that I am inclined to play in my discman. In fact, ""Stay the Same"" has been collecting dust on my shelf since the day I bought it because the songs are not something I'd choose to play at home nor request on the radio. I appreciate his writing efforts but the results are disappointing. Maybe now that he's got the first drafts out of his system, he'll go back to the drawing board and think up something better for his next album."
2,I was looking forward to this release and was disappointed!,"I had been looking forward to this release for a while, but was so disappointed by it. All of the songs sounded basically the same and very ""copy-cat"" to other popular groups of the day."
2,A Elementary as they come,"Some say simplicity in emotion is the best. It's getting at the grass roots of one's feelings and leaves your raw an vulnerable. This may be true, but the same can't be said about lyrics or melodies and that's what you've got here. I was truly disappointed at this CD. My 10 yr old cousin writes better prose. I wouldn't even consider putting his lyrics on my refridgorator magnet. Lyrics aside, the melodies all run together. All the ballads, which comprise the majority of this album, sound exactly the same. The only reason I give this two stars is because he did make an effort to write/co-write most of the songs. And, his voice is now more tolerable than it was back in NKOTB. Now if he could just take some creative writing classes, his next effort might be worth the money. This one's going to my local second hand CD store."
2,Rather disappointing,I hate to say it but I want my money back. This CD was straight up boring. The songs are a cut above tired wannabe R&B groups like Backstreet Boys. Joe's voice is wonderful and is capable of so much more. Next time he will need to step out further and take some risks and skip the schmaltz.
2,Giving the teenies a run for their money?,"I am hugely disappointed with this album. I bought it a few eeks ago after re-discovering the New Kids not so long ago. If this album is giving the teenyboppers a run for their money then I'd hate to hear an album by one of these current boy bands, because this is just terrible. It lacks anything interesting and reeks of some of the cheesiest lyrics I've come across for a long time. There are about 2 or 3 tracks worthy of being singles, maybe just scraping the Top 20, but a whole album full of love ballads and cheesy tunes is far too much. The title track is nice enough, but then breaks into a terrible choir ending. It's basically a ""Man In The Mirror"" (Michael Jackson) wannabe song. There's nothing fascinating about Joey McIntyre that will guarantee him a long solo career. I give him one more album and that's it. He won't even last as long as NKOTB."
3,"It's Not Right, But It's OK","This cd is ok, but it's sounds so much like every other teen group. Lyrics like ""I've been sweatin' you for such a long long time"" shows who wrote the album, but the Eric Foster song, ""I Love You Came Too Late"" is a great song, and should be the next single. It beats the song out now."
5,Great!!!!!!!,Love this CD because it shows he has a soft and beautiful voice. They are all great and they all send out a good message to everyone. You should definitely buy it.
4,Joe's still got it!,"As a loyal New Kids Fan, of course I loved this cd. I am very proud of Joe and I think that he did an excellent job on this debut solo album. My favorite song on the album is 'All I Wanna Do'. The cd is full of soul and has it's share of both fun and serious songs. I encourage all pop fans to check this one out!"
5,Better than ever!,"I admit it, Joey was always my favorite New Kid, so maybe I'm a little biased, but I really love this CD! I am really impressed with Joe's song writing ability as well as the way his voice has matured. Most of the songs have a lot of heart put into them, and I really appreciate it. I adore ""Stay the Same"" and ""I Can't Do It Without You."" They are really insperational for me, and I thank Joey for writing them. This CD shows how talented Joey really is."
2,A NICE EFFORT FROM JOEY MCINTYRE,"I bought this CD because I liked the title track and his second single, ""I Love You Came Too Late"", really caught my attention. So I bought it to see how Joey matured over the years. But I think that no matter how hard he tries, he will always be known as The New Kid, ""Joey"". A few of the songs sound like something that his former group would sing (Give It Up, I Couldn't Stay Away From Your Love, Let Me Take You For A Ride. It's an O.K. pop album for those who listen to the likes of *N Sync or Britney Spears...but that's it. I've heard a few of Jordan Knight's solo effort songs...I haven't bought his album...I wonder if it sounds any different?"
2,Mediocrity at its worst...,"Okay, on a whim, I got this CD the first day it came out. I had heard ""Stay the Same"" and I thought it was sweet and that the rest of the CD would sound like that. Nope. Joey tries too hard to be R&B and pop at the same time. It's like he can't make up his mind. The other good song on here is ""I Love You Came Too Late."" The CD doesn't have a repeat factor; that is, it's not a good thing to put on loop and listen to over and over. If he comes out with another CD, I hope it's mre thought out than this one."
5,Joey Mcintyre Stay The Same CD,The cd arrived when it said it was going to. Was in great condition. Would order from seller again. :)
4,Great Vocals!,"Joey was always a real good singer in New kids on the bock and this just confirms that statement. The hit song ""stay the same"" is a beutiful song that actually teaches you something."
5,this is good stuff,"I was a typical New Kids fan, spending all of my time and money on shirts, trading cards, posters and concerts, but once I grew out of them, I never once thought they could ever make a comeback. I think Joe has done great with this CD, he has managed to stay true to himself but at the same time distance himself from the whole New Kids thing. I got the chance to see him in person at the Mall of America a couple months ago and I was amazed at how good his voice really is. I'm really glad that Joe has decided to come back and do music like this. I honestly can't stop listening to this CD! Definitely a good choice."
5,Excellent CD,"(And what a creative title that was <smacking my head>)I don't really have anything to say about 'Stay the Same' that others haven't already mentioned, but just to reiterate: 'Stay the Same' is one of the few albums that I would actually buy nowadays. I'd highly recommend it, seeing that some of the songs (including the title track) are truly inspirational. Despite it being the first time Joe has ever written music, he does a fine job."
5,Joey McIntyre is back and better then ever.,I was lucky enough to hear the CD already and I was so surprised to find out what a wonderful song writer Joey is. His songs are heartfelt and others are upbeat and danceable. Hey this CD is worth picking up so do yourself a favor and buy it!!
5,Beautiful! Quality Piece!,"Best flatware I've ever owned and even though it may seem somewhat expensive...think again! This flatware is durable, beautiful and has some weight to it. The pattern is ""timeless"" and it looks so good with my everyday dishes as well as my fine china. I love this flatware and will be buying more pieces."
4,Excellent service,"I ordered four place settings of this flatware and the package was torn open in shipping. The package I received had something random thrown in and no silverware. Onieda flatware discounters immediately replaced the order even though the problem was really with the post office. The flatware is very pretty, but it a little lighter than I expected."
1,Junk......dont buy,"I had this antenna on my Toyota Tacoma for 3 days. Day 2 started to get very sticky, day 3 it was horrible static, even tried changing the channel pre sets, with no improvement.....so then i ripped it off my roof and threw it in the trash.I'm using my home antenna until i get my direct connect relay."
4,Nice replacement for my Roady XT,Nice replacement for my Roady XT! 20' cord so i can put the antenna in the rear of the vehicle. Nice Antenna ! Plus a one year warranty! Amazon 9 outta 10 is cheaper for most items!!! Thanks Amazon!
1,Dead on arrival - would not work with Roady XT,Purchased this to allow me to move my Delphi Roady XT between two vehicles and it would not work regardless of where it was positioned. I made sure there were no kinks in the wire and placed it in multiple locations on the vehicle and could not get reception. Even drove down the block to make sure the location wasn't obscuring the view of the sky and no luck.
4,Good antenna,The antenna works great... Have a portable XM Radio and got an antenna for each car so can have radio in whichever car we need it... Have lifetime on the portable radio...
2,Not the same as the picture!,"My XM radio was in a car accident and had to be replaced. I ordered this one because in the picture it looks like the exact model of the one I previously had. When it came in the mail, I noticed that it is actually a different model. It is smaller and the emblem is in the middle, rather than closer to the bottom. I have yet to plug it in to the car to see how well it works, but if you are looking for an exact model, this is not the one. I will update this review after I have tested the product."
1,Dead on Arrival,"Add me to the list of those who received a NIP antennae that was DOA. I took my chances since the reviews were a 50/50 split of working/non-working antennas. It isn't the fault of the seller (unless they are undertaking a ridiculously bad scam), but Belkin clearly needs to get their act together on these!"
1,Poor Quality!,"I'd recommend staying away from this product. Signal kept dropping out in all areas. I tried the home antenna instead to make sure it was an antenna problem, and it worked like a charm. Unfortunately at $10.25, it's not worth sending back for a refund."
1,Horrible Reception,"This antenna has horrible reception! When using it the radio says ""loading"" for about a minute, then says ""no signal"". Occasionally a signal will pop in but a few minutes later it fades and I hear radio noise. I'm very dissappointed. 25 reviews on here gave it 4 to 5 stars so I bought it. It is smaller than the original factory version which may explain the lower quality reception. It's jack also doesn't fit the adapter 1x2 jack on my delphi unit. you'd think they could provide the proper jack or adapters. Very poor Belkin. I know its cheap, but if it doesn't work you've stolen our money AND wasted our time."
5,Works as advertised.,"I've never experienced poor reception with this antenna. It works as advertised. If you have several vehicles and do not like to continue to take the antenna out every time you change cars, then just buy an extra for each vehicle. Set it on the top of your car and run the wire down the window stripping outside of the vehicle and then through the glove compartment or behind it. That way you won't have to purchase a new antenna every couple months because you don't keep untangling it and ruining it every time. I use this with my Sky Dock. It works like a charm."
5,Works better than stock,"I needed an antenna to replace the one that came with the radio when the connector broke. I use it on my semi. This little thing is less than half the size of the stock one and out performs it by a considerable margin. No more signal dropout when going under bridges. Gets me a usable signal even when facing away from the satellite. Just one small northbound arc has no signal and that's probably due to the way I installed it, and not a defect in the antenna itself.Very good product. Delivered in a timely manner, (within the week) and can't beat the price...less than 25% of what major truckstop chains wanted for an equivalent product."
3,Price is OK but quality is just OK too,"My old antenna mysteriously stopped working, so I was happy to find this one at a good price on Amazon. I used this to replace a Belkin that worked great for about 5 years, but this one doesn't seem to pull in as strong of a signal."
5,XM Radio Antenna,"Product was exactly as described, fit our XM Radio skyfi unit, was easy to install and worked great. Also a great price."
4,great!,This item is exactly what I wanted and it works as it was described. Customer service was as I would like all service to be.
5,Same OEM antanae for my XM radio at better price,This is the exact same antanae that the OEM recommends for replacement for my XM radio at nearly half the price. Seller shipped item in an expedient manner with no complications. I certainly cannot complain about anything regarding this purchase.
4,it works,"this product worked, so now I can listen to XM/Sirius radio on my old Roady 2 receiver in the car"
3,"Good price, but my CD player broke in about a year","Good sound and a good price, but quality is an issue. The CD player broke after about 1 year, and the unit was well maintained. I am in the market again for another boom box."
4,A great book for practicing Tesuji,"Reading Get Strong at Tesuji is an excellent way to strengthen your middle-game. The book consists of over 500 problems, ranging from easy(20k) to hard(1d). Each problem helps make it easier to read out situations in a game. Personally, the book helped improve my game by 3 stones."
5,You will like this,"My local Home Depot ran out of this. You can always depend on Amazon to carry hard-to-find things. Have few of these little switches. You can turn on your lamp 3 different brightness easily from wherever you lie or sit without reaching up and under a lampshade to find that hard-to-find switch than sometimes doesn't always work smoothly. Buy one, and I know you will like it. Right now I am using it on a standing lamp and placed the switch button on the floor so I can turn on the light with my feet."
1,Bulb blowing kills dimmer...,"I have undercabinet lighting in my kitchen and loved being able to dim them at night for a softer look. I bought this dimmer and installed it - easy peasy. A couple of months later, it quit working - and I noticed that a bulb in the lights was burned out. My lights are installed properly and I am not overloading the transformer, so I figured it was just a fluke. I replaced the bulb and exchanged the dimmer for a new one. A couple of months later, same thing - bulb blows and dimmer dies. I tried once more and the same thing happened again. It's a piece of crap."
1,not as shown,"The picture of the dimmer clearly shows open holes for a normal plug in device to be used,but what I recieved has none,hence of no use to me...."
3,Missing the Pocket A Bit,"I gave this 3 stars because I like this album in theory - beats are well-crafted and delivery is sophisticated. ""Re:Definition"" ""Brown Skin Lady"" and ""Respiration"" and ""Astronomy"" are solid tracks.But something doesn't exactly work - the beats and rhymes don't always jive - like they were mixed up and matched together later. The rapping, even though well done, is often just enough behind or ahead which takes all the power out of the track. Rapping is as much about pauses as it is about cramming in another word or two. The beats are tight but feature an over-used snare-click that doesn't move anywhere - see ""Thieves in the Night"" and then see the Roots. Listen to KRS-One the ""P is Still Free"" for contrast - Premier's beat is brilliant and KRS is totally in sync the whole time. Then listen to all of Ghetto Music, the Blueprint...."
3,"Chockablock Full of B-Boy Anthems, However, Not A Classic","Mos Def and Talib Kweli's debut, ""Black Star"", defines underground hip-hop - which at times can work for and against the LP. In terms of production, DJ Hi-Tek and Shawn J. Period provide amateurish and underwhelming beats (""Intro,"" ""K.O.S."" ""B-Boys Will B Boys""), while J-Rocc produces the crown jewel of the LP, ""Brown Skin Lady."" On the lyrical tip, Mos and Kweli spit with the heart of a thousand emcees, and while Mos rips just about every verse to shreds, Kweli was still trying to find his niche in terms of flow. The subject matter is limited - wack emcees get dissed (""Children's Story"") while fine ladies get profiled (""Brown Skin Lady"") - but the intricate rhymes (""Definition"") and raw energy (""Respiration"") are what make the album solid. This is a dope hip-hop album that's perfect for break dancing or smoking blunts to, however, don't get caught up in the hype that it's a classic, or you'll be seriously disappointed. 3 Stars."
2,WHAT?!?!?!?!?!,"I know I'm going to get a lot of negative feedback for my review and low rating of this album, but please people, read what I have to say and take it into consideration before giving me negative feedback just because I gave your favorite cd 2 stars. Anyways, I have no idea what people see in this album. The best song was a ripoff of an old classic. It's not that I don't like Talib Kweli or Mos Def (I do), they just don't work well together on this release. If you're searching for good alternative ""backpack"" rap, look elsewhere, perhaps Mos Def's Black On Both Sides which is actually good."
3,"Dope emcees, not necessarly a dope LP","Don't get me wrong, I love Mos Def & Talib Kweli, but this LP was too rushed. You could tell Rawkus just wanted the two to spew out an LP and not take the time to seriously develop a solid album. But, this record did what Rawkus wanted, it opened up the non ""record 12-inch"" buying public to the Rawkus label.The LP has some stand out tracks, but the best track was the ""Respiration (remix)"" which unfortunately was only on 12."" BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!! Several of the tracks, like ""Children's Story"" which is a dope concept/cover of Slick Rick's song of the same title, suffers from weak production. And that's exactly the problem... dope rhymes... blah beats.The stand out tracks:DefinitionRe:definitionAstronmyBrown Skin LadyRespirationI honestly think Mos Def's ""Black On Both Sides"" and Reflection Eternal's ""Train of Thought"" were better LPs. This CD is a decent introduction to the two emcees, but not their best work."
4,Another Tight LP,"I heard ""Train of Thought"" before this yet this is equally as good. Same concept is the same as Train of Thought yet we are blessed with Mos Def on most of the tracks. The one track i didn't particularly enjoy was mos def's remake of Slick Rick's ""Children Story"". He could have easily made a better track with an original idea, other than that the cd is golden."
5,Hip Hop with a Purpose,"If there's ever been a hip hop album with more than candy lyrics (and there have been a very select few) than this is it. Just about every song is both well thought out, and well performed. The only bad song on the whole album is ""Hater Players"" which suffers from a subpar beat and trivial lyrics. Skip that song and listen to the rest. You won't be disappointed."
5,Ushers in a new era of hiphop,"Quite possibly one of the greatest hip hop records of the 90's, Blackstar encompasses all that is good in music. Powerful messages with equally powerful delivery, the lyrical prowess of Mos Def and Talib Kweli is unmatched almost anywhere. The production is top notch and the vibe of the record as a whole is truly inspiring and positive. I recommend this to anyone who has problems with the current state of corporate hip hop, and for those who have an intense and deep love for great music. A defining moment in our musical history."
5,The Black Star album is one of the hottest of the year.,"It feels so good to listen to some real MC's that are aware of what's going on in the world. Life is more than, money and clothes. Mos Def And Talib Kweli are really some of the most prolific hip hop artist out there right now. I just simply love the whole CD. My favorite songs are"" Theives in the Night,"" And Respiration with Common, and many others."
4,"Pre Beats, Rhymes, and Life Tribe Called Quest resurrected!","In the modern (commercial) day of Hip Hop, it is hard to find an album not willing to give up it's jazz and lyrical roots. Not unlike the ingenius beats found on a De La Soul, Tribe, or Roots album. This masterpiece of lyrical skill pays testiment to those looking for real MC's"
5,"1,2,3 it's kinda dangerous to be an mc. . .","1,2,3 it's kinda dangerous to be an mc/they shot tupac and biggie/too much violence in hip-hopThis album is straight up, to the point, filled with dope beats, and the lyrics twist, turn and fill your ear and your mind with a level of intelligence that is all to rare in hip-hop today.Big it up BLACKSTAR! Big it up Hip-hoppers and get out there and buy this album."
5,"Take the Black Star line, ride on home....","This album is a CLASSIC. It is one of the best albums to emerge in the 90s. Mos Def and Talib Kweli are close like ""Bethlehem and Nazareth"". They go together like peas and carrots...well, you get the picture. Mos Def and Talib Kweli are two of the illest emcees out today. They put in years of work in the underground hip hop scene, as well as the world of spoken word. They are two solo artist who manage to come together and still retain their individual essence. With songs like ""Respiration"", ""K.O.S."", and ""Thieves In The Night"" it's evident that Black Star isn't afraid to tackle serious social issues. They also show they know how to have a good time with ""B-boys will B boys"". Mos Def and Talib Kweli continue to shine bright in a hip hop world that has recently been lacking a creative light. Black Star Keep Shining...peace and luv..."
5,Music relative to our times and beyond.,"I'm feelin this. Great music!!!Even for an 'old school' listener like myself. I've listened to every track several times on my way to work each day - a definite stress reliever!I especially enjoyed hearing Brown Skin Lady!BUY this joint, you'll love it!!"
5,Real Hip hop at its best.,"Mos Def and Talib Kweli are both in my top 5 Greatest Hip hop artists of all time and this album proves why. With a perfect blend of style and class, lyrics and realism this CD truly lives up to the hype. I really appreciate what this type of music brings to the forefront. In a society full of MC's with clouded thoughts and twisted motives this CD is a breath of fresh air. Two brothers who do it for the love of Hip hop and shine all the way through. Truly the best Alliance in Hip hop hands down."
5,Should you buy this? Mos Definately,"This album is really good both because of the beats, which are reminiscent of slightly older school hip-hop, and the very real and intelligent lyrics...both MC's work hard to deliver practical and meaningful lyrics, while at the same time, flipping tongues with a quickness that is sure to catch you off guard. Maybe the best hip hop CD I have bought in the last two or three years...Common, who is from Chicago, is also featured on a track, and he rocks out as well. This kind of music is what Anthony Keidis from the RHCP was talking about on Blood Sugar Sex Magic when he said, ""I listen to the music that makes me think."""
5,ill,It's just an all around excellent hip hop album. tight rhymes and great beats. what more do you need?
5,Best Hip-Hop Album for the New Millenium,"I don't care what Jay-Z, 50 Cent, Outkast, Eminem, Naz, Kanye West or anyone coast to coast says, Black Star's album is the best hip-hop album of the new millenium. There is not one whack lyric on the entire album. These brothers laid it down like no others in the past. They combine intelligent lyrics with a battle rap style that few MC's can match. Their versatility is boundless. It's a shame that this will be their only album together. I would love to have heard their underground hits. I rank this album as one of the baddest hip-hop albums ever."
5,"Blackstar Shines and ""Reflects""","I feel that this hip hop duo does just what their names indicate. That is they shine, and it is bright. To put it simply Mos Def's metaphors and Talib's lyrical content defeat any other duo out there. Talib himself indicates his knowledge on current Political events and on life in general. The perspective in which he looks at current issues is imperative. How can a brotha be precise, yet so lyrically gifted? I don't know but Mos Def has the answer. His tenatious charm on the mic clearly depicts what a true artist should stand for. This album keeps you thirsty for more Talib and Mos. If you like this one, you'll love Reflection Eternal's (Talib Kweli/ Dj Hi-Tek) new album which drops in late October. Enjoy!"
5,Prepare yourself for a journey on the Black Star Line. . .,"I have to admit, when I first heard this album, I thought it was alright, but nothing to get excited over. Now, it's been over a year, and I still listen to it almost daily, and everytime it takes me on an intensely emotional and enlightening journey. The lyrical content is both reactionary and revolutionary, while maintaining that positive tip. Def and Kweli give recognition to the old school, as well as to up and coming artists. Their beats and style are tight, but the heart of the album comes out in their deeply personal and political lyrics. My favorite tracks are Thieves in the Night, Respiration, Knowledge of Self, and Astronomy (8th Light)."
2,mos def needs to learn how to speak,My review will start out like this IT SUCKS. Mos Def should go to a speech counsler to get is sler. Twalib Kwali was doing alright until I caught that he just rhymes words which make no sence together. Mos Def is a racist person I might actual like him if he didn't dis the white people in every song. I give this CD 2 stars because I like some of the beats but the lyrics are awful.
5,Underground Rap > All,"Classic. True Hip Hop. Best Hip Hop album of all the time. I liked every track. Talib Kweli is one of the best lyricists of all time and Mos Def has one of the tightest flows I've seen. ""Thieves In The Night"" is my favorite song of all time. ""Respiration"" (feat. Common) & ""Twice Inna Lifetime"" (feat. Jane Doe, Wordsworth & Punchline) are the best collaborations in Hip Hop history. ""Hater Players"" is pretty funny. Get this album, it has everything, it owns all of Hip Hop. Underground Rap owns all. Also try getting Talib Kweli's ""The Beautiful Struggle"" & Mos Def's ""The New Danger"", tight albums. And, look for Wordsworth's ""Mirror Music""; he came on tight on ""Twice Inna Lifetime""."
5,These Guys ARE New York,"Every element of NYC hip-hop can be found on this cd. Mos Def even goes Slick Rick on us and does his own version of ""Children's Story"" ten years after the original. But once you get past the old school tributes, you can find some really excellent music on here. Nearly all of the songs are just laid back and relaxed, perfect for just chilling to. ""Respiration"" featuring Common is my favorite track on the cd and showcases the mellow grooves of this album the best, and its a great music video too.A lot of times Mos Def proves to be the better half of the group (most notably on ""Thieves in the Night""), but thats because Talib is the rookie on this album and Mos has been around for years. Nevertheless this is an underground classic and a great hip-hop album in general. A must buy."
4,classic,"An interesting blend of urban speak and individuality. Black Star is classic hip hop, not to be confused with childhood rhymes or uneducated flows. Mos and Talib are both on fire as they mix and top each other with a barage of fluid rhymes. I never get tired of this albumn."
3,A New Face On Hip Hop? Maybe not now...,"This first installment of Black Star is well... good. It is not great however, and though they do follow the ""use your head"" ideas of Native Tongues before them, they do not have what, say, Tribe did with their first Album... However, I must admit that I am in love with ""Definition"" and ""Children's Story"" with their strong beats and stronger lyrics. The only problem is that many of their songs have very monotone beats that lead to boredom and therefore lose replay value. Black Star deserves credit though, for having the smartest lyrics since KRS-ONE; and even though this wasn't exactly ""People's Instinctive Travels..."" the next one may very well be a ""Low End Theory"". Overall, a lot of promise, but this is not one of the great ones. Here's to Next Time."
5,"Real ""Hip Hop"" live's in ""BlackStar""!","This album was most definitely one of the most profound and most complexed album's which came out in ""1998""...Great Beat's but most of all Great Lyrics by two Real ""Emcees""...Mos Def & Talib Kweli...I recommend this album only too the real ""HipHop"" listeners!!.....""1,2,3 Mos Def & Talib Kweli we came to rock it until the tip top best alliance in 'Hip Hop'....Wyoooh""!!...Peace.."
4,Near Classic,"I believe that this album will become more sought-after as the years go by. The album is a refreshing pace from all of the other garbage out there. Kweli is such a genius, and Mos has so much charisma, it is a great combination. THis is one of those albums where you can just let each track play, without skipping. Definetley some real intelligent and deep lyrics, and concepts. All hip hop fans should check this, and novices of the culture, and music should give this a listen."
2,Not the product advertised,"I didn't receive these grips. The company substituted a grip that is not as comfortable as the originals. The ATI ""softee"" grips are better but they should be removed if they are no longer available"
3,Future Tactics not very futuristic.,It's very slow paced and unsophisticated. It is not recommended for anything more than for something to do if you need to waste a little time.
2,Only good in the beginning,I was fun at first then it became stupid hard and time consuming at the middle/end.
3,future tactics uprising ok,"I thought this game was lacking in a lot of ways and what it boasts for a fully modifiable environment was not necessary for gameplay.You can blow suff up all u want but ur guys can die so quickly from the monsters that its more important to hide untill the end of the level. I mostly just wind up turning the level in to a giant crater.It is basiacally an average tactical game with long, boring, and very difficult levels."
3,"Not the Best, but Still Fun","Future Tactics game with two other games, so I paid only $3.50 for it. The graphics aren't the best, but it does contain a 19-level single player story mode for hours of entertainment."
5,Carol Doaks Simply Sensational 9 Patch Stars,I Love this book along with all my other Carol Doak books. She really is the queen of paper piecing!! She makes it so EASY!! My Hubby took a class from her a few years ago and the next time she is in our town I will be the first to sign up for her class. If there is a book of hers I don't own it is only because I haven't seen it yet. I have used this book the most and made several of the stars on a quilt for a friend for this years Christmas present.
4,Simple Sensational 9-Patch Stars,Book in excellent condition. Lots of beautiful possiblities-now I wish I knew how to do paper-piece quilts! Oops??
3,The contents were not what I expected,The cover was great but the other patterns inside I don't like as well and will probably not use.
4,A valuable collection for REM fans,"There's something that I really love about collections like this. It's a time capsule! I think it's just great to have the opportunity to read things that are not reflections of years of consideration and debate, but are actually the attitudes of the day. It can be eye-opening.At the same time, there are ways in which it can be disappointing. One of the things you get from this book is that Rolling Stone had more or less the same 10-12 things to say about REM over 14 years and a dozen albums. (eg. Stipe's lyrics are ambiguous and often hard to understand, the band is known for its political and social conscience, etc etc).Nevertheless, when just given the opportunity to talk, REM never fails to say interesting things. (It's priceless to read Stipe's reference to two oranges being nailed together, resurfacing, years later). You may put up with some repetition, and some real rock critic posturing, but it will be worth it."
2,False Advertising !,"There are two tracks on this cd single, however, only one is an actual 12"" version.1. George Clinton- ATOMIC DOG - 12"" Single Version (9:25)2. Kim Carnes- BETTE DAVIS EYES - album version (3:43)Not sure why they would put the album version on this cd, and then sell itas the 12"" version? I have lots of these 12"" Classics cd singles and there are actually a few in which they did this. What a rip-off."
1,I DON'T WANNA KNOW EITHER!!!!!!!,"BOTTOM LINE.... IT DOESN'T MATTER WHOSE MUSICAL FAMILY HE COMES FROM ""SKEETER"" YOU CAN'T SANG!!!!! THAT'S RIGHT I SAID SANG! STOP YOUR WHINING, WINANS & AND DO US ALL A FAVOR, EITHER GET SOME VOCAL TRAINING OR SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!"
3,Yummy Mario,"Hey Guys.....Give him a break.....Even if he can't sing, he's still yummy....He can sing to me anyway....I think it's 'nice'!!"
1,Uninspired waste of time,"All of these cuts sound exactly the same, as if they rolled out of Bad Boy on an assembly line. The crap lyrics and crap beats sound thrown together in a hurry, as if the album had to be in the stores by a certain date, regardless of quality. Worst, you get the distinct feeling that you've already heard all of these songs before, maybe in the mid-1990s, and you didn't like them then anyway. Cookie cutter garbage; leave it in the bin."
3,Solid production,"I loved Marios' first album in which he debuted in 97. His voice is really different, and I say to others that bought the album knowing that...Why did you buy it? I am not doing to hype this album because it could have been better. The production was solid though, his ""hurt"" was extremely transparent. Good effort Winans, you redeemed yourself after I listened to your album 3 times."
2,too dissappointing!!!,"I never buy a cd with out hearing it or getting some kind of feel of the album. Big mistake I made to run out and get this album as soon as it came out! The first single ""I don't want to know"" is the only good song on the whole album. This album is terrible...."
3,"Mario's Production Good, Vocals Need Work","Mario's album is a nice album to have in your collection. I have found that it is not the type of cd you can play a lot. You have to be in the mood to put the cd in. Production on the album is handled primarily by Mario, and his production skills are better that average which makes the album listenable. The downside to the album is that Mario's vocals are not all that great and he seems to sing in only one tone on most of the songs.Stand out cuts on the album include ""I Don't Wanna Know"", ""I Got You Babe"", ""Turn Around"", and ""Should Have Known"". Over all the album ends up being better than average. I give the album three stars because of Mario's ability to produce nice tracks that help his voice as much as possible."
1,It's gon hurt alot more,"Dis album wuz not a very good debut album. Mario can't sing, I don't know why he tried. Da only good song on that album is Pretty Girl. Believe me, save your money."
2,Hurt No More,"My friend gave me this CD since she knows I'm a fan of Bad Boy, BUT even though Mario Winans is an artist (def. can sing ok, write his own lyrics, produces his music, plays piano, drums etc.) this album overall is too depressing for me. Yes his first single ""I Don't Wanna Know"" was a sensational hit throughout the states, but his album makes you somewhat fall asleep. He titles it ""Hurt No More"" but with the lyrics, one minute he says he doesn't want to know, and the next states he wants to know (just giving a brief example) its like he is still Hurt. Don't get me started on him singing live ( I saw a few of his performances live) but overall its an ok album, but just something I would listen to every day."
1,Maybe if he could sing . . . .,"The lyrics are stupid and the beats are played out. Still, this album might have worked if Bad Boy had given it to an artist with some off-the-chain vocal talent to distract you from those issues. But Mario Winans can't sing, and the fact that nobody could be bothered to lay down a real melody or a good hook on most of these tracks really draws attention to his thin, reedy voice with garbage range and zero depth. Plus? He sounds as bored singing as I do listening, which means that unless you want to use this as a frisbee, don't bother buying it."
1,REMIX<<<<MASTER<<<MARIO HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL,"Mario Winans is a remixing lame a$$watch ""Sleepwalkers"" the movie....he copied the song from the soundtrack16. Boadicea, is the same as ""I Don't Wanna Know""he stole it from ""sleepwalkers"" the soundtrack, how lame.."
2,"Different Voice-Great Songs, Mario's Voice, Boring Songs","It's seriously a shame when listening to someone's music and u sing over them to make your own songs up...This is what I do to Mario's CD. I think he has some very good tracks on his CD. However, his voice is so monotone it's hard to believe you're listening to a different song except for when the music or the lyrics change. And why is it that he has some of his best beats used as interludes. And please would someone tell him that the guy from 112 can't sing either! What the heck...u have to 2 non-singers on one song...What did we do to really deserve this? Mario is a very talented producer...keyword: PRODUCER! Not singer. Mario keep your day job and leave the singing to in the shower. Or please find another note to sing on...Oh yes and why do the up-tempo songs sound like 1 long song split up throughout different parts of the CD?"
1,Wack&that is being Kind,"now Winans is Talented as a Producer behind the scenes but as a solo Artist he just doesn't cut it for me at all.this album feels like it was meant for Carl Thomas&He was smart enough to turn it down.""I don't wanna Know"" with the Enya part&all was already used by the Fugees on there cover of the Delfonics ""Ready or Not""&it was cool for 1996 but is ultra corny now.still I give Puffy Props for Hustling dated Samples in 04.He knows what he is doing.but this album is a Barker."
1,"WACK, WACK, WACK!!!","I HATE his 1st single ""I don't wanna know"". He was so unoriginal by using a beat that the Fugees already popularized in a their major hit.His single reminds me of the 1st time I heard Ashanti singing ""Foolish"", the beats they choose do not match the style of singing, so it just turns a classic beat into crap. His singing is so blah and very monotone. I listened to about 3 of his songs and almost broke my friend's disc in half. I want him to go back to Yellowcity and stick to producing or singing an occasional hook. Sorry if this seems harsh but Hay, somebody's gotta keep it real since some of you want to be too NICE!"
5,What R&B should be...,"This Cd is exactly what I hoped it would be. Mario has an amazing voice. I was afraid P. Diddy would be in on every other track throwing in pointless crap, but he stayed out and let Mario do his thing. If you want something to bump to or dance in the club, then this is not your album. If you want some soft, smooth R&B cop this album immediately."
1,Now You Know,"Mario Winans' breakout cd is not up to par. As a matter of fact this cd is wack. First things first the guy cannot sing as well as others out in the industry at the moment ( Anthony Hamilton, C. Richardson, Van Hunt...etc. ). His vocals need some work. Secondly there are too many weak wannabe soundalike dance tracks. None of them work and are pretty corny and wack. Thirdly weak interludes break up the already dismal flow of the album. Fourthly the lyrics aren't that great and can become tiresome without a great voice carrying them. In actuality there were only 3 or 4 songs that had some appeal mainly `I Don't Wanna Know' and `Shouldve Known', but the rest are skippable, generic filler tracks. You can tell Diddy doesn't put much effort into his R&B acts anymore with this album and Carl Thomas' album being less than stellar. Remember when Bad Boy used to dominate with Total, 112, Faith Evans? This album is a throwaway...don't waste your money."
5,Mario Winans Is off the chain,I like this whole album. He fianlly got his big break. This album is gonna to be huge. My favorite songs are1) Ready for love2)I don't wanna Know3) Turn around4) 3 days ago5) Got me in disbelief6) Pretty Girl7) I got you babe
1,fruitcity,"I didn't think it was possible for a Winans not to be able to sing, but there seems to be a exception to that rule! I was really feeling the single that was out but after hearing the cd ...all that whinning, people save your money and let's send this brother to a vocal coach!"
2,not worth $13,"Mario Winans has a very good, soulful voice - and I really like ""I Don't Wanna Know"" - but the album has passed me by as an okayish piece of music. ""You Can't Judge Me"" and ""Never Really Was"" are possibly the only other good songs. His production skills are excellent, though. Put a few more upbeat songs in there next time, Winans!"
1,Horrible,Althought he is a great song writer and makes great back ground vocal he's cd is trash I took it back and demanded my money back
1,TERRIBLE...TERRIBLE...TERRIBLE!!!!,"Mario Winans has one of the most flat, annoying, useless voices in the industry. I mean he is absoulutely horrible. She tries to sing out of the little range he has, and it sounds even worse. He sounds like he is whining, sorta like Keith Sweat, but atleast Keith Sweat had a stronger (but still annoying voice.) If it wasn't for his addictive (but repetitive) single, no one would've brought this mess. I swear he sings on the same note throughout the whole song, and the beat and mood of the song remains the same throughout the whole thing. Mario please stick to producing and writing because singing is not your peice of cake."
3,Average......,"I bought this CD along with Carl Thomas' new joint ""Make it alright"" and Raphael Saadiq ""Live at the House of Blues"". The Mario Winans CD is ok and catchy from time to time, but definitely nothing classic. I think Mario has a great voice and I wish he would just ""sing"". If this CD were a new movie at the movie theater I would tell you to wait until it comes out on DVD. That's just my opinion."
5,off da hook!,"this debut cd is one of the best ive heard in a long time.nice to hear a male's side of the story rather than women talkin bout how they get hurt all the time!bangers on this are beside the obvious i dont wanna know, which is gettin rather played out an borin to listen to, 'this is the thanks i get' ft. black rob, an 'pretty girl bulls**t ft. foxy. this cd is a top shotter for all the manz (and women) that appreciate slow jams with a hip hop feel!cop for this one!"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"Honestly, I wish I would've read the reviews online before purchasing this album. The only half-way good song is ""I don't wanna know"" all the rest are pretty much sad, sappy, whining, songs that speak about him being ""played."" At least he could've whinned and sang about other stuff other than being hurt (like Keith Sweat). After all, the title of the cd is ""Hurt No More"" and all he does is whine about being hurt. Does not sound like the hurt is gone and neither does this album deserve a good review. Please save yourself money and time, this one is a drag."
2,My first reaction was--This Album is awful!!,"But I admit, due to all the hype surrounding him, I gave it another chance. That and the fact that Mario is gorgeous! I actually like ""This is the Thanks I Get""--he sings it in a very sexy way. I always thought that ""Don't Wanna Know"" was corny as ever, but again, it's one of those songs that (kind of) grow on you. My first impression was that his voice is not strong enough to be solo. Now I've come to appreciate certain qualities in his voice--he kind of puts a hip/hop slur on his words. Overall, the album is mellow and relaxing but easily forgettable. I really wanted to give Mario a chance but he (and Puffy) failed miserably this time."
3,A tad disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this album and it arrived in the post today. Alas I am a bit disappointed at what i have heard so far. Admittedly i have only played it once in my car for about 10 minutes flicking through the tracks. ""I dont wanna know"" and ""Never was"" - stood out for me plus one other i cant recall.Fortunately for me i only paid 6.00 (I am from the UK and ordered it from canada) so i am not too unhappy at what i paid for it. I have what i believe is his first album (?)""Story of my heart"" and for me its a better album. However i do respect his lyrics and what he is putting across and so the album is very worthy of purchasing if just for that.Mario has been off the scene for a while so I was expecting something a little more sophisticated. Perhaps I need to listen to the album much more so my rating of 3 stars may not be worthy."
2,"Not bad, but ...","I was truly disappointed in this album. After hearing, Don't Wanna Know, and really liking that song, I was certain that the rest was going to be outstanding. There are a total of 3 songs that I enjoyed on this ablum."
1,RETURNED,Oh Yeah ...This was the worst Bad Boy album ever!!!! I really expected a whole lot more than what I got. The whole album was a filler it was no effort or quality put in this project. You know this is really sad because he has been singing background/Writing Music for Bad Boy and other artist for the past decade and for him to drop this project he really needs to hit the booth again and rethink this ASAP. This is a cd that could not even grow on me so I returned it after a few days of trying to deal with it. Although I need to I'm not gonna go over each song but if you still insist on having this album I recommend THAT U BURN IT!!!!!!!
2,"Good Concepts, Alright Lyrics, Bad Tracks",I feel where Mario is trying to come from but it's like alot of people already said it gets boring listening to him. I like the single alot and can listen to it all day but anything else on this cd I'm not feelin'
5,"A Family Upside Down, The review","This is a story of a aged old parent who has a hard time getting along with a daughter who tries whole heartedly to patch things up from her hurtful childhood memory, her brother tries to comfort her in the time of her needs and urges her and her father to get together and ptach things up before his time goes.This film is a must see for all families who have struggled to keep it together."
4,All the greats but....,"All the greats but...if you've been spoiled by all the covers of these great songs, you may be a bit disappointed. These were recorded before the ""wall of sound"" effect became so popular. After hearing different versions with what sounds like a full orchestra backing them up, it sounded odd to listen to the original recordings with just a few basic instruments. But hey, if these songs weren't so great, there wouldn't be so many covers!"
4,Nice fit,I love them and they are very useful when practing on gravel or concrete. They will stick to matts or wood. Good traction but sometimes to good. Good for stances but not for fluid movement like in capoeria.
4,50-50,"I have bought total of 4 pairs and this white one happened to be not properly sewn around the ankle. Otherwise, i would have give it a 5-star."
4,Not what i expected but still pleased.,"I wear a size 11 shoe and on the chart on another website it said that a 45 was the equivalent to a size 11. come to find out the size i ordered was about a half size too big but they still fit fairly well. also, a big thing is that these are not actually feiyue brand shoes but they are knock offs. they still are very light, cheap and super comfortable. i cannot stress how comfy these shoes are. they might look a little strange at first but you get used to them. i like them. 6/10. would probably buy again."
1,Child and men. What about WOMEN?,"I practice QiGong and am a FEMALE. I find this ""child and men"" thing absurd. What am I supposed to do? Guess or order ANY size and get stuck with a pair of shoes that won't fit?"
4,Very good value,"Well made and comfortable, very light. A little sticky for Tai Chi but still outstanding. Shipping was high but at least they shiped UPS 2nd day."
2,Very Smelly,"I ordered these shoes to use for parkour training because of the grip. When my shoes arrived they had an incredibly potent and disgusting chemical smell. It gets on my socks and my hands. I could barely stand to be around them long enough to lace them up. They are sitting outside on my porch right now because they contaminate any room that they are in. None of the other reviews have mentioned this, so it could be a one time defect. I really hope the smell goes away, because they seem like excellent shoes otherwise and they cost very little."
5,classic,"if you aren't buying this book because you loved it and want to share it with your kids, repent, buy it, read it and share it with your kids."
2,better live,"This album is too plastically pop-oriented to be one of singularity or to function as a good representation of what this artist is really like; it's a bit overdone and exaggerated and seems as if she and the producers are trying a little too hard to dress up the music, but seeing Regan live is a whole different story. Bare, stripped-down, and heartfelt, her live performances are worth experiencing over and over again. I recommend seeing her live performances first and getting live shows from tapers. However, if you can't get your hands on recorded live shows or can't see her for yourself and you want exposure to a good, unknown female artist who happens to be from Richmond, VA, then check it out. ""I Will Do"" and ""Shine On"" are the gems on this album."
1,I wish it worked.,"Bought a few of these Stump Removers hoping to get rid of stumps (mostly red oak) around the yard.First, the package (cylinder) is at least 25% empty. Why leave so much room for air?Second, I followed the instructions completely - drilled one-inch holes as instructed (takes a while if you have a lot of stumps), filled with product and poured water on them. 3 months later the stumps are still there. And they look EXACTLY the same. The product obviously does not work as advertised (manufacturer promised 6-8 weeks to see the results). Or maybe I have these special stubborn stumps. I don't know...."
2,Herbicide Stump Remover Hi-Yield Granule 1.5 Pound,"Herbicide Stump Remover Hi-Yield Granule 1.5 Pound- don't really know yet, it has not been in use long enough to know if it is working."
5,beautiful sketches,This book is fabulous! It's easy to read. It's interestingly told. The whole book is scattered wonderful little vingnettes which make it easy to remember who is who and the whole book is actually a great overview of the history of the period! Very worth reading!!
3,I didn't look close enough to title.,"I rated it 3 stars because I misread the title. I wanted to read about the Protestant Revolution, Martin Luther, etc. This book did not cover that time period; but if I would have looked at the title closer I would have realized that."
3,Did not draw me in,"I didn't finish this one. It was a weird premise that she doesn't tell her ex about the baby but then suddenly she drives across country and demands he take part in the child's life but he ""too afraid"". The chemistry was not right.I have liked some of her other books including ""The Backup Plan""."
4,Angel Mine,An excellent book! Great follow up to After Tex. I'm anxious to see if there will be another one to follow. To many characters need closure.
3,Being generous with 3 stars,I am such a fan of Sherryl Woods but It is taking me forever to finish Angel Mine. I put it down read something else and try to come back but It's just to boring.
3,Not up to par with Serrly Wood's usual quality,"While I have enjoyed several of Sherrly Woods' books, I did not think this was one of her better efforts. While the premise was promising and the setting in small town Wyoming could have allowed for a variety of interesting characters/events, the main characters of the novel fell flat. The characters were one-dimensional, and the ending (especially Todd's sudden reconciliation with his father and Heather's sudden ability to produce a broadway-quality play in middle of nowhere Wyoming) were contrived. The smaller characters such as Henrietta, Sissy, and the Judge were colorful and enjoyable, but the main plot line I found dissappointingly flat, contrived, and unimaginative."
2,"Not My Mother's Pressure Cooker, Unfortunately","I grew up using my mother's old Presto, and was really excited to see what the 21st century brought in the way of pressure cooking. This Fagor set is not at all what I hoped for. Main problem is, I have NO idea how to tell when optimum pressure has been reached, and whether it is being maintained. There is no rocker, just a valve that sputters off and on. I have burned everything I have tried to make. This is very frustrating, as I am an old pro at pressure cooking.The lid is hard to get on and seal. Last night was the last straw. I somehow got the lid jammed on incorrectly and the steam was leaking out the side. It took my husband pounding on the handle with a hammer to get the stupid thing to come off.From the pictures of the new Fagor pressure cookers, it looks like they may have solved the pressure problem with a pop-up button, but I think I am going back to Presto."
5,Setting the Record Straight,"To answer the review that questions the truthfulness of Miller's quotation compendium, I can attest that Rush Limbaugh did repeat his ugly joke about cats and ""dogs"" because I heard it myself in the mid-90s. He may have apologized profusely once (I guess this means that he certainly DID make this kind of crack!), but he repeated it nonetheless. Why it was not noted in the press probably has more to do with the fact that it was old news and no one wanted to repeat this viciousness and give the guy more free publicity. Nonetheless, it happened, it is true and thanks to Miller for collecting all of this dishonesty and exposing it to the light of day."
3,It's Original Format Probably Worked Better,"This book's preface reveals that it got its start as a $3.00 pamphlet covering the same topic, and its sucess led to its expansion into a larger book.While I admit to having never read the original pamphlet, I suspect it probably worked better in shorter format. While there are a number of outrageous, stupid, or just plain scary quotes from right-wingers, especially the talk radio loons, the book feels padded with a number of quotes that made me wonder, ""so, what's the big deal? That's a legitimate policy debate.""Sadly, this seems to be just another in a series of books that attempt to use the same tactics on conservatives that they have used on liberal for years: an attempt to create ""sustained outrage"" by making everything a controversy. American politics deserves better."
3,Roe Conn in this book?,I cannot believe that Roe Conn on WLSAM Radio in Chicago was quoted TWICE in this book!! He's no politico -- and if he were anything it would NOT be in the GOP.Talk about quotes being taken out of context.
1,Oh for God's sake.....,"""By the way, I also heard Rush's quote about cats and dogs...""A third witness who falsely claims to have ""heard it"". Have you guys no shame? Do you really think you're fooling anyone?"
3,Great book!,Why is this book 68 dollars. Do they know that the only people who have to read it are college students??This is the book to read if you want to understand why China is such a messed up place. We have created this monster and now we have to bear the repercussions of our actions.
3,It's ok,"It was ok. I think that it was really to hard to controll Eaton. I wish that it was like syphon filter or metal gear solid. Even 007 releases are much better, but if u want to buy this game go ahead, and u will get enjoyment out of it on the 1st and second level, but the rest of it is just average."
2,Rent it- Don't Buy it,"This game could have had more creativity worked into it but instead you have something that has no ""intrigue"" just your USUAL BORING arcade fair. The plot line is nonexistent so you don't feel like it's urgent to get your ""missions"" done and the gameplay itself is SO basic that anyone can accomplish them easily. There's no challenge and the plot doesn't compel you to feel as if you were in the story. The voice overs used are either comically cartoonish or lame. I resold my version as soon as I played it and rented TENCHU instead. This game didn't exactly suck, but it didn't exactly keep me interested."
5,What your doctor won't tell you!,"If you are interested in real, effective solutions to sinus problems, buy this book! Very clear information, no pressure to ""do it my way"", great research and resources. Top notch!I purchased this book based on a recommendation from a friend. I have learned more about my sinuses from this book than I ever wanted to know! It is a highly complex system and one that has been outright ignored by 'modern medicine' hence the amount of sinus ""sufferers"". Don't wait any longer, physician heal thyself (with the help of this book) :-)"
3,Go Online,"This book is twelve years old. It has some good (yet overwhelming) information if you are a sinus sufferer, but much more up to date information is available for a cost on [...]. I picked out a few of the things recommended to help with sinuses and they do seem to be working, but if you do everything that it says in this book or on the site, you will be able to breathe out of your nose but you probably won't be able to pay your bills this month."
2,Does not work with Vista,"When reading the minimum system requirements, be careful to review the supported operating systems. Belkin has not yet developed Windows Vista drivers for this card."
3,Works well but not very rugged,"I bought this for my XE PC in 2007 so I got my money's worth out of it driving firewire 800 external disks, but I have broken off 2 of the 3 sockets so I think it is time to replace it. I've never had that happen on any PC card before.March 2012 Update: The last socket recently broke so I replaced the card. When I examined what had failed it was evident the failure was due to the tack soldered leads breaking off. Not a good design. If you happen to have one of these be very careful plugging in the cable."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"While the installation of the card and software was easy enough, I was never able to get it to properly recognize my Lacie 1Tb external Firewire 800 drive. The problem could lie with the drive -- the Lacie tech said they work with some PCI cards but not all. The real disappointment was that in the process of hooking things up, one of the three ports came loose and disappeared back into the chassis -- a sign of sub-standard workmanship. Probably a good card for the money, and still functional (well, 2/3rds functional)with other firewire/i-link components, but I'm going to have to pay a bit more for a card that will work with my drive (which works fine, albeit much more slowly, on my USB 2 port)."
3,WOULD NOT WORK,"This card did not work on my setup, but I can not say it is the cards fault only. Just could not use."
5,Belkin Firewire 800 Cards,The Belkin Firewire 800 card is an outstanding product however in the specifications and product description it does not explain that the card is not downward compatible to 400 speed without additional cables or firewire 800 drives which are expensive with limited availability. The product as shipped is not a simple plug and play with most firewire 400 configurations. To use the card you must acquire either a conversion cable or a firewire 800 drive.
1,Card Sucks,This card I bought for a Mac G-5 but it does NOT work on a Mac G-5. This was a total waste of my money.
2,Not the same as advertised!,"I wonder why this is advertised as made of cotton because it is clearly not. The description also mentioned of ""smoother"" but it is NOT. The size is way too big even if my husband wears a XXL. The 2 polo shirts that I ordered from them is not the same as the one shown in the pictures. I had it shipped to a New York address and paid for expensive shipping to the Philippines. I have spent so much for items that disappointed my husband and me."
2,Overpriced and shoddy supplies,"I purchased this printer largely because of the great price, the large capacity toner cartridges and the reputation of Konica/Minolta. The print cartridges are expensive, do not print but about half of the 6000 projected page rate, and tend to develop print problems long before the toner is used up. Steer clear of this product, because outside of speed, it simply does not perform as advertised."
3,"Not as good as Jeff Lynne's works, but still a quality album","Not so much a cohesive album, more a collection of hits and misses. Jeff Lynne's writing and production skills are missed, but ""Honest Men"" (though the lyrics are a little silly), ""Thousand Eyes"", and ""Once Upon a Time"" are as enjoyable to me as a number of ELO favorites.Some of the other songs are forgettable, but that doesn't make this CD not worth buying for the open minded ELO fan"
2,This Is Why Jeff Lynne Didn't Want A Reunion Of ELO,"This is a second rate ELO with Bev Bevan trying to exploit the name, adding some unknowns in the group. The sound is still there, but the material is on most part below the last original ELO album BALANCE OF POWER.I think there is one stand-out song here, ""For The Love Of A Woman"", which is reminiscing of the classic Lynne style. It were released as a second single from the album, the first were ""Honest Men"". But the record buying public didn't take Bevan and his Part II seriously enough. He did however make a reasonable amount of money with touring, performing the old hits. Another ill-fated studio album were released in 1994, now with nearly all the old group members back in the fold. Two were missing, Lynne and Tandy. The sound is there, the sparkle is not."
4,Delightful,"This series is full of understated humour and character driven stories, which may turn off AbFab fans and those expecting French & Saunders like theatrics. I say give it a chance. This series is sweet and funny. The series is filled with great actresses and the writing is done well. I can see members of my own local churches women's fellowship in each of these characters. It may seem like a mundane series, but it really showcases small town life and the women in them, funnier and better than any reality show could. I really grew to love this show and I can't wait to purchase series two."
5,"If you like Jennifer, Joanna & Dawn, this is for you ...","It's not AbFab. It's not the Vicar. But, it is hilarious and serious both at the same time. I had to watch the first episode a few times before I really understood 100% what was going on. But after that, this show pulls you in. It's great."
5,Endearing,"The first two episodes were a bit off putting as I thought they were trying hard to be funny. The characters seemed a bit contrived, and the cast was trying too hard. Once beyond that, the show really gets to your heart and makes for enjoyable and engaging viewing. Not a lot of belly laughs, but good acting and interesting enough story lines do develop. Enjoyable and recommended! Looking forward to season two, if there is one in the pipeline."
5,My new favorite Brit-com,"Jennifer Saunders is a genius and I'll lick anyone who says otherwise. She has achieved new heights with the Clatterford series, which she writes and also acts in. This series has it all-Dawn French in a true comedic acting role and funnier than ever, both understated AND broad humor, brilliant writing and quirky but fleshed-out characters that you can't help but care about. I want to live in Clatterford and join the Guild! I own seasons 1 and 2 and can't wait for season 3 to make it across the pond."
3,Comedy seen many times before,"I was looking forward to a new comedy but what I got was Comedy that has been done too many times before on TV. And I as much as I hate to say it, I really wouldn't spend money on it.I watched the one I got sent from Netflix.Actually some of the comedy reminded me of ""French & Saunders"" comedy back in the 80's. It had some charm and beautiful scenery. And some really bad jokes! One in Particular almost stopped me in my tracks to keep watching, Dawn French puts on Mens Clothes(that belonged to someone who died very recent)in the House of Wife, and I was in shock, not seeing any funny side at all. Sorry girls, I love British Comedy and Love British Tv, but this show was awful at least for comedy. Maybe as a drama it might pass?"
2,Complete misfire!,"This sounded SO good in the write-up. Then we watched the show, then the next episode, and so on. So many opportunities for some wild comedy, or some genuine character development...all missed! Ladies in a doctor's office, in a social group, and on and on; it should have fizzed, but all we got was a disjointed fizzle. Dawn French is completely wasted. What a bummer.Clatterford - Season 1"
5,Don't think Ab Fab??,"Well, I laughed just as hard as at Ab Fab. However, perhaps it's a bit closer to the Vicar of Dibley....certainly, for me, it feels closer to the Vicar, than it does to Calendar Girls.It's a very warm, very caring kind of humor; the characters may very well remind you of people you know and love. I'm looking forward to more episodes.If it's from French and/or Saunders, I know I'm in for a great time."
5,It's not AbFab or Adina and Patsy,"Just like another reviewer said, ""do not expect AbFab"". Even though I knew this I still ordered the series expecting a silly, funny show, much like AbFab. However, although the show is nothing like I thought it would be and really hardly features our 2 main girls from AbFab, it grows on you at an alarming rate and is impossible not to enjoy! The characters are so interesting and they are able to weave a wonderful, real life like story of mostly just everyday things. Sure, there are moments of true silliness, but this series seems to be reaching deeper then most of the more ""comedy"" style series coming from the BBC as of late. You will love this, just don't expect AbFab, and you'll be sad that there are so few episodes."
5,A slice of Maderia cake.,"First of all, I must admit that I am a huge French & Saunders/Absolutely Fabulous fan, that being said however Clatterford is the most charming series I've seen in years. Written by the amazing Jennifer Saunders it follows the daily village life of the eclectic members of Clatterford's Ladies' Guild, with touching and hilarious insight. It is an instant classic, that no fan should be without. After all it's not all jam and Jerusalem."
3,Never got the game.,"I purchased this video game and never received it. I contacted the seller 3 time. He NEVER replied to any of them. I had to file a complaint with Amazon to get the matter settled. I was told he was traveling and now the game is out of stock. The seller was just launched and I thought I would give his/her a chance. Never, again. I would not buy from him/her again."
5,Great Fun,"This Game Kicks butt! I loved The first game I must admit, but this is even better. The game is much larger and a bit harder than FF1 but WOW! I've been mashing bad guys for over week and I can't get enough!Sure there are a few faults with the game, but nothing major,(I mean how many games DON'T have faults?). On the other hand there IS a lot to shout about. The GFX and SFX are cool (It's all very moody!). Gameplay too is top drawIn my opinion, if you liked MGS but would have liked a little less ""brain strain"" and more punch/kick/shooting. then you will love this!"
5,Open Heart Clear Mind,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I actually purchased it for my father as a christmas present but when it arrived I couldn't resist reading it myself. Then, my husband also picked it up and actually read it from cover to cover! Most impressive as he rarely reads a book all the way through at all.I do recommend it to everyone."
5,One of the best books I have read,Over the last few years I have purchased over 50 copires of this book and given it to my friends and co-workers. It is that good! It has a very uplifting message that is well grounded in real life. I very highly recommend this book to those interested in Buddhist philosophy or to anyone who simply wants a more open heart and clear mind.
3,What a gip!,I had flashlight plugged in since I bought it last year and hardly ever used it. Now the batteries are dead after using it for about an hour after a lightening storm knocked out the power in my neighborhood. What a GIP!
1,WRITTEN ONLY TO GET BACK AT B.D.,"This book was written by Davis only to throw Kathryn Sermak in her daughter's face because of ""My Mother's Keeper"". Davis subtly refrains from mentioning B.D. in any way until the last chapter where she has her supporters like Mia Farrow talk about what a liar B.D. is. Unfortunately, the rest of the book, is as another reviewer pointed out, a loving tribute to Kathryn Sermak. Its ""Kath this -n- Kath that"". Davis was obviously a very disturbed woman with manic tendencies that were demonstrated all through her life, no thanks to a controlling mother, which she herself became. This book offers vignettes about her career but its nothing that hasn't been read before. In whole the book is dull and trite."
3,So-so,"OK, OK, I've read the ending of this book several times(bcs. the emotion of the heroine really gripped me), & that's why I gave this 3 stars, but an almost rape victim(the heroine of this book) getting stabbed only a bit on her thigh & nearly bleeding to death for that 1 small stabbing? Does this story make sense to anybody? (Don't rapists usually hold the knives at the victims' necks or the chest areas?)"
4,Another O'Hurley,"This book originally was book two in the O'Hurley's family saga. The family consists of an Irish song and dance couple, who are the parents of Trace, their son, and the triplet daughters. This book is about the mysterious Trace and is an anomaly somewhat in Nora Roberts' style of writing. It is more of a spy, mystery, adventure. Of course it also has the element of romance.This story/book has been combined with other volumes of the O'Hurley family series, so that is something readers need to be aware of, both now and in the future. But you will find yourself engrossed with the family and their lives and especially their love for each other."
1,Without a trace review,"My least favorite in the series and again I say because I wasn't as close to the characters. As usual the writing was great, but I had to force myself to read to the end, mainly to find the family."
5,The end of a great series!,"This book, the four and final in the O'Hurley series, was a great ending. I loved the drama and romance!Love Nora Roberts!"
2,BEWARE! RE-RECORDINGS!,"Be careful when buying the MP3 version of songs. Oftentimes, you will get a re-recorded version of the song you are seeking. This album is a great example. If you buy these, you will notice that something just ""isn't right"" about the songs. The lyrics are the same but they're not quite exactly the versions you fell in love with on the radio. It's because they are re-recordings or very bad remasters. For these Drifters classics, buy the single/LP versions in MP3. Amazon's MP3 store is a great place to buy songs without having to spring full price for an entire album when you only want one or two songs. But make sure you're getting the right versions."
2,Re-recordings? Definitely.,"I agree with Charger, I too felt this strange feeling these weren't the same versions that I had heard my dad playing when I was a kid. Now I feel compelled to continue searching for the originals. At least this MP3 album was cheaper on iTunes than amazon, but now I know why. Be sure to listen to samples before you buy, especially if you are particular about the original vs. re-recordings. I don't mean to give the songs themselves such a low rating, as they are quality recordings, but I didn't get quite what I was looking for."
1,Don't Buy This,This is not the original music. It doesn't event sound like the Drifters. Pick one of the other collections that is actually the real cuts.
5,Authorative....,"This is one of the best books on chromosomes and the inner workings of the genome. Read this a couple of times and your fundamentals will be crystal. Newbies to genomics or cytogenetics need to get some guidance while reading this, since certain concepts require explanation."
4,never kink.. almost,"this is a nice , lightweight hose and is ""somewhat"" kink resistent.. after using it a few days im afraid i would refrain from using the words ""never kink"" .. given the proper conditions like moving around the yard from one end to another it will kink.."
1,Hose Failed on 2nd Day of Use,"Although I have several of these 7612-25 (and -50) hoses with no problems, this one leaked at supply-end fitting no matter what I did, AND after only two days of light use, it totally failed with a huge leak a few inches from nozzle end. I actually started to balloon out several inches before it blew!"
3,Good but has lead in the fittings.,"This is a very nice hose. I really like it but was concerned because I couldn't find ""lead free"" on the package so I called the company. I was told the connections on the hose have 2% lead. I was told it still meets the federal guidelines to be labeled safe for drinking water. It is possible to make the fittings lead free, but they didn't. Making a few cents more on the hose was more important to the company than making a product that was lead free. I also asked if it contained PVC. I was told the outside of the hose contains PVC, but the inside is medical grade material that is safe for drinking water. Maybe all hoses contain PVC - I don't know. But it does seem that what is not stated on the package is just as important as what is."
4,"No bad, but it does kink","I replaced my old black rubber hoses with this. They kinked...this does too. I would not leave this hose under pressure for long, by the way. It is lightweight and you can drink out of it, if need be. The old hose stained my hands and the house paint. This is light weight and clean. Decent hose, but I would have liked kink free and maybe a bit stronger."
5,No leaks or kinks,"For years I fought with a 75 foot hose that leaked at the couplings, kinked and resisted being rolled up. This hose didn't do any of those irritating things and I was not soaking wet by the time I finished using it. It rolled up very nicely on my hose reel. I'm pleased with this purchase."
2,Hose brass nozzle came off after 3 months.,"I'm very disappointed with this hose after 3 months of use. It was absolutely perfect for my use and exactly the right size, it also never kinked. When using this product with an attachable device like a water wand, the brass piece at the end starts to loosen and eventually comes off, leaving you with a useless hose which can't screw onto any watering nozzle. The only redeeming quality is that Amazon is letting me return it for a full refund after this long of a period due to the lifetime warranty included. For that reason I'm going to give it 2 stars, but I highly recommend getting a hose made in the USA like the platinum flexgen hose from Gilmore if a larger diameter is ok for your needs."
5,"No ""hose"" job on this product!","Light, compact, well-made, and no kinks/twists - Exactly as advertised! And very affordable. A great product.Apex 7612-50 NeverKink Boat and Camper 2000 1/2-Inch-by-50-Foot Hose"
4,Comfortable,"I bought this shoe for the low heel, something I can stand around in for long periods of time. Very comfortable, not that pretty though"
4,AWESOME,"this watch was very good. durable and my daghter loved it. although, about a year after we got it, the battery died, and we could not get it fixed. but still, a great watch!!! :)"
4,"Not for everyone, but great nonetheless.","I have to admit, the book got me looking at stray shopping carts in a whole new way! I find myself eying a collection of carts in the corner of a parking lot, considering their classification and wishing I had my camera with me.I know, it's weird.Not everyone is going to appreciate this book, or its deadpan, clinical nature. But if you have a weakness for the strange and/or absurd, this will be a great book to have on your coffee table when you have company over. Especially if you have a Petersen's Guide right next to it.And the front half of a shopping cart mounted like a hunter's trophy over your fireplace.I wonder if there's a market for those."
1,A tedious screed,"This is the third Sunstein book I've read, and definitely the worst. He's evolved into just another authoritarian who's upset that not everyone shares his views, so, by golly, it's time for Big Brother to ""regulate"" what other people say and write ""in the public interest."" So what else is new? Another writer could have set out the arguments in a more honest manner, but not Sunstein. Every time he seems to consider an objection, it turns out to be a caricature. His extreme legal positivism is presented as merely common sense, when it is a highly disputed approach in law. I regret having wasted my time on the book."
4,"Thought-provoking, but not really scholarly or scientific","This was an interesting read for the first... 50 or 70 pages. Then it seemed like the info was repeated over and over again without new substantiation... kind of like debating with oneself - I lost interest right there... maybe that's because I have no background in law...However, the main thesis of the book is really thought-provoking for those interested in online communication and polit science. The fact that internet is not ""all-good"" and not ""all-evil"" is evident from reading this volume; a few good examples vividly demonstrate it, mostly anecdotally and logically, rather than impirically.I'd recommend this book, it's fist 50 pages are worth the money!"
1,Liberal idiot proposes fascist solution to nonproblem,"Please, get this man a real job ... something he's qualified for, like maybe refilling the milkshake machine at McDonald's. His argument that there is too much choice, too much freedom of speech on the Internet is inane, unconstitutional and viciously patronizing. He would love to have a kill switch on the Web, such as the one now being used in Egypt. Very nice. Yes, please protect me from having any thoughts except that those with ""managerial expertise"" would deem suitable for the ignorant masses. And thank you so much, kind master, for saving me from myself. If books simply must be burnt, this one should be among the first into the flames."
2,"Interesting, but comon!","Lacking in almost everyway. It was lightly interesting, but not really very entertaining. Doesn't make you want to keep reading. Read only if it is assigned in class, like it was for me."
3,Sony FRS radio,"I have been a FRS radio user for a couple of years now. Our family uses them for skiing, climbing, camping and crowded public events. I am trying out the Sony because of its small size and the fact that it is water resistant. Of the 4 Motorola radios that I bought last year, 2 have failed due to damage from the elements. The Sonys work fine with the Motorola radios. The special features are set up oddly, but as I only use them for basic talk/listen that is not an issue. One feature I do use is the ability to lock the panel, which is good if kids are using them, so they don't end up on the wrong channel or code. The instructions are very confusing."
1,Poor Radio,"I am an electronics enthusiast, this radio just didn't cut it, it may have an attractive case but don't judge a book by it's cover. Poor sound quality, most people would have great difficulty reading the instructions, weird layout, I personally recommend the Motorola Talkabouts, as one of the previous reviews stated that he had two Motorola's that failed to the elements, he must have been dipping it in and out of a pool or something, actually I have done that, I jumped in a pool with the radio on me, with no case, bag, or any protection for a full minute(typical me!), let it dry, 2 hours later, good as new. The motorolas are your best pick."
4,Tabac Aftershave,"This is a classic men's fragrance that my husband was using in the '70s. No longer able to find it locally, Amazon.com is our source. The fragrance doesn't seem to last quite as long but still very nice."
3,It's not what my husband likes,I bought it for my husband but he does not use it. He likes the Tabac Balm which is not easy to get. It is a much better product
2,Smells weird,"Maybe it's not possible to objectively rate a smell that you've applied to yourself. Maybe I'd have to smell it on someone else. After all the great reviews, and with a reasonable price, I decided to give Tabac a try. I just don't see why anyone might go out of their way to find this stuff. It doesn't smell bad, but it doesn't smell good. I guess I could see it if it offered some kind of soothing effect, but it just doesn't. There are some really nice aftershaves out there..."
2,"Not for medium to large breeds, even as little puppies.","I bought this for my 12 week old German Wirehaired Pointer puppy, thinking she had a little mouth so I should get her a little toy. She ripped it to shreds in days. Perhaps this toy in this size is for small breeds?"
3,CHEW TIRES,This item is 'well built' but neither of my dogs will have anything to do with it.Doesn't mean the toy is not good. Looks good... maybe I just got one that is too big for them. Maybe it doesn't taste good...
4,Found What I Was Lookin' For,"The Panasonic PV-GS31 is an excellent camcorder to learn the basics and capture excellent digital video. It had exactly what I needed: a light for night shots, LED screen, and a great zoom feature for close-ups. It transfers well to the computer to upload the video I take on the MiniDV tapes. But make sure you purchase a firewire cable (4 pin to 4 pin) and have software like Intervideo DVD creator or Windows Movie Maker to take advantage of video editing. It's a good buy without the features you don't really need!If you're looking to take good pictures, don't rely on the Panasonic camcorder. Instead, go buy a tiny digital camera with at least 5 megapixels. This camcorder can take pictures but they're less than 1 megapixel, which equals poor quality pix."
2,The picture does not make it,"We returned this video camera due to video picture quality. The camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video, even after changing settings, the video had a ""grainy"" look. We just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work, but the picture was worse than our previous camera. Purchased the PV-GS65, next model up with 3CCD's and love this model. As a matter a fact we still had the GS-31, used the same tape, shot the same footage, and reviewing the two different shots, the GS-65 did 100% better.The camera has a great feel in your hand, although the menu button can be difficult to press."
3,Basic Bargain camera,"I bought this about 3 months ago. I primarily use it to record my son's hockey games. The zoom is quick and the footage comes out good. It is very easy to use, lightweight, and the audio is good. The still pictures are only 640 x 480 which is ok but it isn't for making any keepsake photos. Had I known how useful the still photo feature was I would've bought a camera with higher quality stills. It gave me a warning that the head needed to be cleaned which was a bit surprising considering how new it is.It does upload video through the usb cable. Download the drivers for webcam on the site and get some video capture software. It seems to be restricted to 15 fps with the webcam drivers, even though it records video at 30 fps."
4,Not a bad buy,"I bought mine last week at Circuit City and it worked pretty well for what I wanted. The Camera ain't that great, but it is just a bonus feature that I never expected. I really bought it for the camera. It is easy to use and manipulate. Anyone buying it for its purpose (a camcorder) will not be disappointed with the purchase, but if you are buying it for a camera, be prepared to flush your head. I recommend this to anyone just starting out in this field"
2,Not the best for taking pictures,"This camcorder is not the best in taking quality pictures. If you want better pictures, I would recommend getting something else. The pictures I took look grainy and totally weird. The battery life sucks too, with only 3 hours. I didn't really like the lighting when using the camcorder. Images looks dark when taking indoor or outdoor. The only good things about this camcorder are the small size and it is fun to play with. But for quality, I would go for something else."
4,Panasonic Cam Coder GS 31 model for my personal use,Panasonic Cam Coder GS31 is good and suits my requirements. It has a 1000X zoom and very efficient to capture images and to replay that in televisions
3,Nice camera but it doesn't cut it,"Nice small,not heavy camera. I liked the features but the quality of the recording was not to my satisfaction. For example, if you videotaped people wearing baseball caps in a bright sunny day, you could not recognize their face, all you see a is black shadow, specially if they are dark skin. In low light, the recording seems like ""slow motion"" and very grainy.I returned it. Most MiniDV have the same problems. I returned this item. I am still searching for the right camcorder."
1,unable to transfer video to computer using xp,Panasonic offers a USB driver however no video driver. This means that anyone using windows xp will be unable to transfer video to their computer. When talking to panasonic they just said they didnt have a driver and were not developing one. They offered no suggestions or alternatives.
2,Port and Company cotton T-shirt,All the Port and Company cotton T-shirts I purchased were different sizes. One XL shirt was smaller than another XL shirt. The inconsistency of the shirts (sizes) was signifcant. Some of the problem could have been because the vendor sold me T-shirts made in three different countries. In contacting the vendor they were more concerned about informing me about all the charges I would experience in returning these shirts. Would have been nice to have them offer a few resolutions like sending me the correct size shirts or at least offering an apology. Took a huge hit on restocking fees and return shipping for something that was not my fault. Bottom line...poor customer service and poor quality product.
4,"Not quite a Cheetah, but getting there","For those of you longing for the long-lost, beloved, eternally-revered Cheetah T-shirts, these Port T's are getting close. They are made of a good thick, durable cotton fabric rather like the Cheetahs, though it has a slightly different ""hand""--not quite as smooth or stretchy as the Cheetah material (though maybe that will change with wear). The sizing is slightly smaller than the Cheetahs--XL is a closer fit than an XL Cheetah, though by no means too tight. Great color selection and price.Of course the roomy Cheetahs had that magical, mysterious, and priceless ability to hang in some subtly advantageous way so as to de-emphasize one's flabbiness, an ability which we all miss so very much. The Ports, due to the just-slightly stiffer fabric and slightly smaller sizing, do not have this magic, alas."
3,What size are they?,The t-shirts are okay but I have a problem with the sizes. I ordered 3 t-shirts in 3 different colors all the same size. Each t-shirt was made in a different country. And even tho they were suppose to all be the same size the size of each shirt varied quite a bit.
5,Thick cotton shirts,I bought these as an anonymous gift for someone in need. I was very impressed with the weight and thickness of the cotton for the price. I would recommend these to someone looking for a nice weight T-Shirt.
4,Fit good around the neck and Arms.,I was pleased with these line of shirts for the most part. They fit snug in the neck and the arm sleeves are long enough to give a professional appearance and not like your trying to show off any muscles. The only draw back I have found with these is that they fade quickly. I will buy more in the future.
4,OTC Tie Rod Press,"This is one of the better press tools for tie rod ends to be pressed out of the steering arm since the tool is the most steady & stable for the job. The seesaw/lever tools can sometimes be scary. This press tool itself, despite it's stability, is not what does all of the work. I tighten the tool as much as feels comfortably possible without damaging the tool. More often than not, the rod end does not pop out. Therefore you apply sharp blows with a hammer on the knuckle/steering arm to ""shock"" the rod end and make it pop out of it's stuck position. Works like a charm."
4,The superior non-US release,"When the discussion turns to the marketing strategies of record companies, one can always count on The Angels being mentioned when the talk turns to the strange end of the spectrum. The US version of this album was labeled as ""The Angels From Angel City"" and contained an oddly different track lineup, much the same as the US only ""Face To Face"" a decade before. Instead of just issuing the album in the states and letting it stand on it's own merits, both albums were loaded with both new and old material, making them an instant pseudo-greatest-hits collection. Very strange, especially considering the ease with which ""Beyond Salvation"" and ""Face To Face"" could have stood on their own. Whatever the case, Let The Night Roll On stands as one of the band's shining moments and should have been a huge AOR staple. Unfortunately the US was busy being infatuated with M.C. Hammer at this time and couldn't be bothered. Tough luck, America."
4,excellent travel case,"This little case fits like a glove. Not a great idea to keep the laptop in the case all the time as it would get too hot, but its easy to get into and has good padding."
3,Good DVD,"Good DVD for new goalkeepers. A bit boring to watch. The same author also has a book (The Soccer Goalkeeper), which I highly recommend."
3,Over My Head,This book contained some very interesting ideals. The philosophy in the book was way over my head. Much of it seemed redundant to me I'm sure because I didn't understand it. It certainly offerred insight into the priesthood from the local parish to Rome.
3,Adequate remakes by originals,"The Manfreds do a decent job on this cd, but there is just a HINT of ""dine and dash"" at times. The production sounds cheesy in places, which is what happens when you rely on synths to reproduce something that was organically analog in it's original incarnation."
3,"Bad movie, great feeling","I agree this is a bad film in most respects. Low production values, bad dialogue, and everyone looks like they did their own makeup. And I'll admit the singing isn't too far away from regional summer stock, or that college musical you remember from your junior year. But Amy Adams is adorable, and if the actor (Alec Newman) who plays the male lead seems like an android (the scene where he cries is especially awful), the jazz standards made me smile. I saw it free on Netflix streaming, and I really liked Adams, and also Harriet Harris (of Desperate Housewives and Broadway musicals), who gets to sing the blues. Jazz notable Joey DeFrancesco gets to try out his acting chops and play some smoky organ jazz with (I assume) his regular trio. It's worth 90 minutes of your time if you still have a soft spot in your heart for those little forties musicals where romanticism finally wins out over cynicism, and the love of a good woman cures all the bad things in your life."
2,Blues Music,I started to watch this movie but it didn't hook me. After half an hour I gave up. If you are a kiver of 'blues' music the music alone may hook you but I found the plot was dragging along at a VERY slow pace. There is some chemistry between the two lead actors but the story line leaves much to be desired. I'm not a blues fan so the music didn't interest me. So I'm giving this movie a thumbs down.
1,"Who is Giancarlo Tallarico, and why did he do this to Amy Adams?","Caught this movie as a freebie from Netflix. I like Amy Adams. I like jazz vocals. I couldn't stop watching this movie even though it was terrible. I was amazed at the low production values, the stilted dialogue, the clumsy plotline and the amateurish quality of the whole production. Although it is listed as a 2009 film, it was actually made in 2006, right after ""JuneBug"" and before ""Enchanted"". Amy Adams hadn't really hit the big time yet, and perhaps that is how she ended up in this lame film. You can blame Mr. Tallarico for both the directing and the writing. I checked IMDB and he has no other directing or writing credits. Based on this film, it is unlikely that is going to change."
1,This is a bad movie folks,This is a made for T.V. movie that doesn't even meet that low standard. The plot is fantastical with some of the most inane dialogue ever to hit the screen. This must have been Amy's first gig - she was not believable as an aspiring jazz singer nor was the male lead. The Joey DeFrancesco Quartet is the only good thing about this movie. Too bad there doesn't seem to be a CD available just for the music.
3,"(3,5 Stars) Good for fans","This film is good for'people who like movies like Azumi, it's caracters are good and remember me of the game Tekken and the story is quitte nice if you are the type of people who like samurai movies not to historic."
2,Big Disappointment,"I rented this movie hoping that it will be a great remake of the original ""Samurai Reincarnation"". My hope was quickly dashed when the movie proved to be full of cheesy special effects, unconvincing violence(one decapitation scene was particularly sorrowful), fuzzy plotline, and general lack of acting ability. The main character, Amakusa, looked like some Japanese heavy metal guitarist without the guitar. Musashi looked like some old guy out of shape. The bonus CD had some interesting segment on Yagyu Jubei and his hometown."
3,east meets west,"I am specifically looking for the gospel album from group East Meets West which has a track (and I am not sure if it is called) either Next Time Around or This time around. The words of the chorus are: This/next time around, the world will see His glory, the King shall wear his crown. I would really appreciate being able to locate this song as my husband has been trying to get the CD forever."
5,Enlightened Tarot,"Tarot de Paris opens a new realm of tarot. The exquisite art conveys mystery, beauty and subjects rich with revelations. The interpretations both inform, enlighten and deepen the reader's awareness of worlds within worlds, questions within questions and opportunities beyond expectations. Simply by staring into any of the beautiful cards the reader is infused with a desire to go to Paris and examine further its monuments, mysteries and messages--perhaps discover ancient treasures yet to emerge. J Philip Thomas is an artist and a mystic whose further creations will be eagerly anticipated."
1,Caution! This item is discontinued.,I ordered the Sony SRF-M37V but is not what I received. This item is no longer being made by Sony and you will get the cheaper SRF-M37W if you order.
3,Rough going,"Country boy Lemuel Barker comes to the big city (Boston); there he works menial jobs, is taken for a sucker, is even arrested - but also falls in love. After many adventures, he returns to his country town with his bride. The major problem here is that all the secondary characters are better portrayed than the main character, Lemuel. He is stiff and dull where he could have been comic. Some of the middle sections of the book really drag. The end sounds as if Howells was planning a sequel, but it never came off. Not one of his major works."
2,Parts not all correct,"According to fitment listed, this part should work on my 2000 Ford Explorer XLT 4.0L SOHC (Vin ""E"") motor. While the head gaskets were correct, I had to order some of these gaskets separately because the ones included in the kit were incorrect. Purchased this particular kit because of the excellent price. I wish I had just gone ahead and purchased the kit offered by Advance Auto Parts instead. It was $50 more, but at least it probably would have been correct. Very disappointed in how much money was wasted here. A partial refund by the seller would be appropriate."
3,needs software,"i would like to have software for my mustek 1200cu scanner i really need help, i can scan but nothing else, i was told that i needed software, please HELP."
5,TRACK LISTING,"1. LITTLE WOMAN2. LA LA LA (IF I HAD YOU)3. JULIE, DO YA LOVE ME4. EASY COME, EASY GO5. CRIED LIKE A BABY6. WAITING AT THE BUS STOP7. HEY MISTER SUN8. THE DRUM9. JENNIFER10. GETTING TOGETHER"
4,Heavy Hitters of Systems Dynamics,"""Modeling for Learning Organizations"" builds off of the extensive experience of top professors and consultants using the SD tools to test strategies and build an understanding of firm and industry dynamics.""Modeling"" also includes a section overviewing the various simulation software packages available to modelers. Though developers like High-Performance Systems, Vensim, Pugh-Roberts, and PowerSim have made product enhancements to date, the sections from each company provide a great introduction to what is out there how each package can be applied.The most valuable aspect of the book is probably in the case studies and methodological explorations of several authors. A number of key insights are offered as authors reflect upon the successes and shortcoming of the methods each chose to use to explore and develop models in a variety of business and public environments.This is definitely a must have for any SD library."
2,am I missing something?,"Readers beware, Spoiler Alert bottom half of review:I bought this book based on the reviews it received on this site. It must be just me, but I thought this trilogy, though well-written, was incredibly disappointing. Did I really read 600 pages for that?? If you like satisfying endings, not 'turn the pages quickly, can't wait till this certain thing happens' just to have it never happen, then this book isn't for you!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!........The fact Maggie and Ian both thought the other had died and NEVER laid eyes on each other again (until they were old and gray) made this book seem null and void. What was the point of reading it? Why even create these characters? It was depressing. Maybe it's real life and all that, but when I sit down to read, it's nice to escape real life, not see just how depressing it can be!"
1,Stonewyck Trilogy,"CAN ANYONE OUT THERE TELL ME: What happened to the stand-alone ""Lady of Stonewyck"", published in 1985? It is NOT the same story as the final section of this compilation! In ""Lady"", Maggie & Ian are reunited and return to claim Stonewyck as their rightful heritage. In the ""Trilogy"", the story skips from Maggie as a young ""widow"" in America down two generations to her granddaughter, snd substitutes a totally different story line for the intervening years. I feel saddened and cheated."
3,Civil War in the South,Well-written historical story about the tragedies of Southern soldiers during the Civil War. The story is told from the view of the soldier on the ground. Good read.
3,Pretty good read,"Co. Aytch is a good book that gives a very good picture of a southern soldier's life during the war. Sam Watkins writes very well for an untrained writer. He was very prominant in Ken Burns ""Civil War"" and now I know why."
1,Generally Poor Quality,"After a review of available umbrellas, we chose this one. The main reason was the generally good reviews. The first order was returned to Amazon by UPS. Apparently, the poor packaging caused damage. We received a second one. The packaging was also fairly inadequate. However, we assembled it and put it on a patio table. The cloth material of the umbrella is poor quality. It is thin and translucent. It just feels cheap. The pole is made of a very thin gauge aluminum. The first moderate wind that we had caused the umbrella to blow over. The top section of the pole (where it tilts) deformed so that it is no longer vertical.Is there anything good to say about this umbrella. Nice color. Other than that, it is cheaply made and generally poor quality. I was originally going to give it 2 stars but then I realized that 2 stars would mean it was almost reasonable.I would not buy this brand or model again and would suggest that no one else does."
1,"THE PIC IS MISLEADING, it's MAROON NOT RED","UNBELIEVABLE! I was looking for red umbrellas and ordered these, described as red. The picture in the ad clearly shows a bright red umbrella. I was severely disappointed when they arrived. Not only are they MAROON, or dark red, but they are exactly the same as umbrellas I could have bought locally for nearly $20 less! Ordering these was a huge waste of time. Do I have to ask if red really means red?"
4,"Good umbrella, not perfect though","We've had this for several months now. The crank & tilt wors well, however, the only thing I wish was that the tilt would ""lock"" in all tilt positions--you have to tilt it all the way down for the tilt to lock and stay.We have an open slat patio, and needed this for our table, and to make the umbrella fit & the tilt work under the patio, we cut off the bottom of the pole about 8"", now it fits great & tilts under the patio. I also drag it up to the sliding glass door to act as an ""awning"" against the hot afternoon sun."
4,Very good for the price,"This umbrella is lightweight, yet strong enough to hold up very well when blown over by the wind (we are not using this umbrella with a table). Other umbrellas that we had purchased from other sources (for significantly more money, I might add) did not fare as well.Although we have yet to see how this umbrella stands up through an entire Arizona summer, so far we are quite pleased."
3,Three Stars,The color is accurate. It doesn't have a wind flap at the top and the crank works a little hard. Worth the money I guess...
2,Stay away from this one.,"This was a replacement umbrella for one that flew away and broke - I neglected to close it before a storm passed through. Since the umbrella selling season was over I resorted to an on line purchase. I chose this umbrella because I like the aluminum/crank type and loved the sunny yellow color. However, the order took over three weeks to receive, and when I got it the piece on top wouldn't screw on because the pole top was crushed. The cover fabric is very flimsy, and the whole thing always seems to be on the verge of flying away. . I would not recommend this umbrella. I will buy a new one in the spring, and this will be a spare."
2,"It was great for 1 month, then broke","I really liked this patio umbrella for one month. It blocks California sun well, and cranks are smooth. However, after 5 weeks, the metal spring fell out. Very disappointing. Amazon return policy expired 10 days before the umbrella broke. I guess it's going in the trash."
2,cheap one,I used it for three months and then the pole broke where the tilt mechanism installed. It broke by itself... probably during one of the rainy and windy days. I noticed it later. My previous umbrella lasted 12 years. And I didn't expect this umbrella to break so easily.I'm not going to spend a penny on this brand again.
1,Convoluted mess . . .,"This was my first Katherine Stone book and it will be my last. These are my reasons: Some readers praise her ""beautiful"" writing, but the attempts at lyricism are overdone and painful. Bed of Roses contains enough misunderstandings, failed communication, and implausible coincidences, and plot twists to fill five books. And finally, Stone has to spend a lot of time with her characters giving exposition in order to get through character motivation and background, and the result is a painful read. I hate talking about a writer like this, but sometimes the truth must be told. This book is atrocious, and I think she must be able to do better. Don't waste your time."
3,Different but good,"I liked this book. The author has a different writing style, the story goes forward and backward in time alot which became a little tiresome but overall I enjoyed the characters and the plot held my interest. The ending was a surprise which is always good in a romance/suspense type novel. I would recommend it only to someone who loves a romance novel."
2,Annoying,"I listened to this on tape. The reader was very annoying, as was the way it was written, had to be written, his grey eyes...It was a soap opera on paper. Who knew you could, had to.. actually write things down the way the melodramatic soap stars have always spoken- in italics. The only thing that kept me going was to see how the story would resolve and now I feel like a sap for even waiting for that. Not for intelligent readers. I embarrass myself admitting I listened till the end."
2,Painful start but worth hanging in there.,"Ms. (Dr.?) Stone's writing is intelligent, but the first portion of her book followed the romance recipe of mystery + loss + misunderstandings so much that I found it excruciatingly painful. But I hung in there and the undeveloped characters finally became people I cared about and by the end of the novel I wished the book would not end. I hope in her future books she gives us a little more character details in the beginning so that we can care about the people enough to keep reading."
4,Very Thick Language,"The Life of W. B. Yeats is an excellent book, so far as the reader will take it. The book is written in very thick, intellectual language, which fits a lot of information in each chapter, enough usually to fill a small booksworth. The book tends to be vague on dates, but very well describes whats going on in Yeats's life at certain time periods, and how he is reacting to it. It does not explain the poetry the best, but the book does leave an excellent sense of the person."
1,Cheap,I thought they'd be a little bit better than what I recieved. For a towel that cost 6.00 dollars each you would think you'd get something a lot more thicker. Towels at Walmart or Kmart that are less expensive are thicker than the towels I got. Was very disappointed.
2,Not very satisfied,This tv is good for watching movies but not very good for playing video games.vertical lines are not straight at the edges when using a game system and the horizontal lines are fine.
2,not so great as potholders,"I bought a set of these so that i could toss my cloth ""mit"" type potholders that were getting badly stained, and somewhat natty after washing. Although i agree with the other reviewer that there are many uses for this product, such as being good trivets, the items just don't really cut it as potholders. trying to bend the squares in half to take a pot out of the oven is just asking for trouble, because they don't easily fold over evenly, and actually heat up after holding items with very high temperatures for about 10 seconds. also, you can burn the tops of your hands on top oven racks if you reach into the oven and you're not careful. i love the silicon cooking utensils and thought i'd love these too, but no....i find i'm still using the nasty looking oven mits i have, and I have not really been able to throw them out, unfortunately. i also find the potholders somewhat difficult to use with pans on the stove- they are just not very comfortable to hold."
4,Very nice product but...,"watch out for those holes! As mentioned in a couple other reviews, the holes in the potholders make a dangerous area if you don't pay attention for a second. It would be very easy to get a nasty burn if you don't make sure to orient the holes off to the side. Other than that, they're excellent, nice solid feel, great grip."
2,not as advertised,these are way too stiff- ok for trivet but useless to grip and remove object from oven in safe way.
3,flimsy,"These are OK but if you really want good grabbers upgrade. The size is good, but they are a bit slick and not thick enough for the job."
3,"Shields the heat, but not easy to handle",It shields the heat very well. But it's a little bulky to fold it and use on an oven pan. So far it has been okay but I'd prefer something more moldable.
1,Not suitable as potholders,"I've had these potholders for over a year now.- They are stylish and easy to cleanDislikes:- They do not protect your hand very well from heat.- They do not bend well making it difficult to use them to grasp things.Even when baking cookies at 350 degrees for only 10 minutes, when using this potholder to remove the pan my hand begins to feel warm as I'm setting the cookie sheet onto the counter. When used to grasp a casserole dish that has been in the oven for 45 minutes, my hand begins to get hot almost immediately.I only use them if I've got a big project going on in the kitchen and all of my other potholders are already in use."
1,They Work . . . Less Than a Minute,"I bake cookies. The first time I used these, to take a single sheet of cookies out of the oven, before I had moved all eight cookies to the cooling rack, I felt the heat of the sheet through this product. I had to put it down before I was finished because it was too hot. The product does not work as well as a plain cloth potholder. I would donate it the to the Salvation Army, but I don't want the poor to get burned any more."
4,Great gift for a good price,This was a perfect after xmas gift for my wife and was a good price.I would order this again.
1,Disappointed,The sample I recieved was empty. So I didnt get to try it out. Wasnt very happy about it
2,Terrific theme runed by poor directing.,Although the story line could have been something special but the acting and directing did not succeed in portraying the deeps emotions involved.
5,Goodwin & Simonson's Classic is...,"...A must-read for any true comic fan. Some of the best storytelling, reviving the 1940's hero for the modern age. That a story so pure could be told through a series of 8-page back-up tales is a testament to the skills of Archie Goodwin and the newcomer Walter Simonson. A self-contained story, this is one of the best books you can buy today. It is truly a must-have!"
4,Fast faced surprisingly dense story,Manhunter i was a back up story in Detective Comics during seven issuesof 1973 and 1974. with one full sized story as the last issue of the series. The story is fast paced with really good art by Simonson. The story is quite dense but fast paced I think Simonsons art gets crowded out at times He doesnt have room to operate because of the density of the story and the lack of pages but this is a really good story and I strongly recommend it
3,Cooper often talks too much,A good story but a little too wordy. Even Mark Twain agrees with me on this. Still a good look into life as it was in the NY upstate early days
5,This Album Is HOT!!!!!!!!!!,I love Ginuwines new album. You can hear him sing higher in this album and the beats are hot. I like this album better then his frist one.
5,sophmore album puts first album up on the top shelf.,"ginuwine once again teamed up with timberland and once again has every cut slammin'. some songs stil tend to sound the same, but the beats that timberland mixes make you forget all about the lyrics. i give a+ they keep making albums like this one the world would be a better place.PEACE"
4,I liked It I really really liked it,I think Ginuwine did give 100% on this c.d. I listen to it everyday when I get home from school. There's not another cd I would take for it. I Give Mad Ups To Ginuwine!
1,im not hating but his album is wack,i think his first album was nice but this one he did not need to put out there sounding like that he need some help on the album if i could have gave him no star i would the album was wack
3,Listen to your Friend's Copy,"As Sexy as Genuine is..... there are a couple of songs on this CD that he could have left off. I am so sick of CD's that have a ""skit"" included in them! NO ONE wants to listen to skits... we all want to hear music! I admit that there are a couple of songs on the CD that are good..... but I spend so much time SKIPPING over tracks that I hardly have a chance to enjoy the few songs on there that are worth listening to."
1,He's good looking...,He's good looking...but there's not much else to say. I find his singing insincere and the lyrics wanting. But I would recommend Ginuwine to young girls and men who just want to drool over him. He is fine.
4,No Additives or Preservatives.,"Ginuwine must be thanking his lucky stars for hooking up with producer Timbaland. One of the best and often-imitated beatmasters in the business, Timbaland's unique style gives Ginuwine's voice personality and depth on the overall successful ""100% Ginuwine."" While Ginuwine gets credit as the artist, the real star of the show is Timbaland, who provided smart beats and rhythms and seductive grooves on the infidelity hit single ""What's So Different,"" the sensual slow jam ""So Anxious"" and the showdown with Aaliyah in the excellent ""Final Warning."" At 71 minutes, ""100% Ginuwine"" does have its minimal share of filler, including an overwrought re-working of Michael Jackson's ""She's Out of My Life."" After the hit single ""Pony,"" it wasn't certain if Ginuwine would survive the one-hit-wonder syndrome, but this solid second album silenced skeptics and established him as an above-average fixture in modern r&b."
2,It wasn't that good.,I thought that most of the tracks were too laid back and weak. Some of the beats were totally wack too. I don't suggest going out and buying it unless you want to waste some $$$!!!
4,69% Ginuwine (11 out of 16 great songs.),"The album is bookmarked with two throwaway tracks at each end. It's in the middle where you'll find the funk. Ginuwine reminds you why you couldn't stop humming to ""Pony"" off his freshman album. ""What's So Different"" is a funky signature song that we've come to expect from Timbaland. Other standout tracks are ""None Of Your Friend's Business,"" ""Wait A Minute,"" ""Do You Remember,"" ""I'm Crying Out,"" ""2 Sides 2 A Story,"" ""All Night, All Day,"" and the 7:23 long opus ""Final Warning"" (featuring Aaliyah). This is Ginuwine's breakthrough album. With 11 fantastic cuts, this will keep me happy until Me'Shell NdegeOcello, Eric Benet, and D'Angelo have their albums released. Your music collection is incomplete without this CD."
5,It's a problem solver!,From most of the songs I've heard on the track have told me alot about myself and also opened my eyes on some things. I've always liked your music because it tells about people and their everyday relationships. And also my cousin Chante is crazy about him and I know for a fact that she is his #1 fan.
2,It could have been better.,"I was extremely disappointed with this album. First of all I bought it thinking there was a song on it that I had liked, THE SONG WAS NOT ON IT. I'm not totally dogging out this album, there are like three good songs on it but whatever. Another thing, why does Timbaland have to be in everything? Especially when the album is called 100% Ginuwine."
1,Horrible Album,Timbaland ruins this album beatwise. The beats are just weak and Ginuwine's whiny voice just doesn't complement it. There are no standout songs and the album just wanders aimlessly from track to track. No coherence.
4,THe BOmB DiGITy,"This CD is very tight. Timbaland helped out alot on this CD. Without Timbaland what would Ginuwine B? He can sing pretty good but we all can do without the skits in the songs...I liked ""I'm Crying Out"" but right when the song got good BOOM. ""Do You Remember"" was good but when it reached its peak BOOM. This album has the beats that alot of R+B today is missing not so much the voice though. This CD is pretty good and I recomend you get it if your a fan of good R+B."
5,Do you know you are so sexy !!,"If only I can have just one dinner with you. I just want to have dinner, nothing more and nothing less. Your CD is so tight. Keep up the good work."
1,it really stank truly stank iluv u g but the songs are WACK!,i truly loved his first album especially the first cut only when youre lonely but i dont know what happened to this album maybe he rushed the project or something but he sure shouldve waited for tim and missy cause he sure messed up on this one he could have saved the label a whole lot of money and time
5,Ginuwine is one of the SEXIEST singers in the music industry,"I listen to Ginuwine whenever I have the chance to. I love everything about him---from his good looks to his singing and dancing style, all the way down to the beat of his music. He has body language that can make a woman go crazy!! Ginuwine really is my favorite singer and he deserves as much recognition as possible. He will always be #1 in my book!!!! I LOVE YOU GINUWINE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,50%,"First id like to say........ TO MANY INTERLUDES. Whats so different, so anxious, #1 fan are some standout songs. However for a Timbaland produced album.... its pretty weak. The topic choices of most of the songs are just overplayed and boring aswell. But what gives this album 3 stars instead of 2 is ""same ol G""... gotta love that track."
5,100% Ginuwine,"I remember this album when I was in the 6th grade. I love this album and played it constantly and loud. This album has always been in my wish list since then(on paper). This album is as funky as the debut. This album boils over like a cauldron of lyrical passion,accentuated by bomb beats,clever and sensuous scenarios,and the charismatic singer's soulfully sincere delivery. This personable and distinctive style of storytelling is the album's foundation. This album has been certified 2x Platinum. Remember,this was 1999-2000."
3,100% Who?,"Their are alot of good songs on this disc (Tracks 3,5,6,7,13) But no Pony's or Tell Me Do Ya's. Genuwine is an okay singer (no where near Tyrese), so Timbaland has to pick it up and he does. But what does that say if your an R&B singer who has to depend on production, not your voice, to sell? (except Prince) If I want beats, I'll buy rap. Genuwine ahd better become more diverse if he wants to be more than a means for Timbaland to get his music out. 100% Genuwine is good, but he can do better."
5,Tha BOMB,"The 100% Ginuwine Cd is the bomb!! I especially like "" I'm Cryin Out"". I would never hurt Ginuwine like that!!"
5,I agree with the comments and alot more.,I think all the songs from the bachlor and 100% ginuwine are all tight.I like you a lot and got both of your cd's.Baby I think you are so fine.
4,I think that 100% Ginuwine is off the chain!!,"Ginuwine is a very fine and talented man. My opinion is that this is the best C.D. that Ginuwine has ever came out with!! Ginuwine you need to come jam-lando and do a concert, bring the whole crew!! Much Love 100% ginuwine all the way baby!!!"
5,Ginuwine I love your cd,"100% Ginuwine is the bomb. I like this cd more than I like your Bachelor cd. I love all your songs on this cd especially So Anxious, Do You Remember, No.1 Fan, None of your friends bussiness, and Wait A Minute. The songs None of your friends business I like that alot because it's not none of your friends business what you and your boyfriend or girlfriend do. I like So Anxious alot to because you find many ladies and gentleman that are anxious to do things they shouldn't be doing. Wait A Mintue is another song that I like alot because girls and boys most of the time always believe what somebody else say and don't even give their boyfriend or girlfriend time to explain because of what somebody done told them. 100% Ginuwine is really for your mind because it tells you about your society and the way you are if you really listen to it because everybody tell their friends things and believe what their friends say. Good luck in the future.Your No.1 Fan"
4,light weight and very quiet,This is not a powerhouse like my corded Skill 77 - but I use it more than the 77. I no longer work in the trades and I find this does 90% of what I need a circular saw to do. I especially like how quiet it is. It is light and handy for overhead or out of position work. My only complaint is that the blade hieght adjustment could work a little better. But overall a very good tool.
2,Served its purpose,"I purchased this book as a requirement for my philosophy class. Although it served its purpose as far as philosophers go I found Gandhi to be quite unrealistic, contradictory and hypocritical. I'd recommend Plato for a more mystical, spiritual and entertaining philosophical experience or Epicurus for a more concrete, scientific approach. Keep in mind both are VERY old school... as in Ancient."
5,"great book, lively text, fun illustrations","My kids, aged 6 and 10, and I have enjoyed this book for several years. The story is hilarious and clever without trying to be. Because it's a Hawaiian style re-telling of the gingerbread man, it's familiar, yet fresh and different. The illustrations are great and make the story come alive, but are also filled with enough wacky detail to make them enjoyable to look at again and again. My kids and I have read a lot of books together, most only once, but this one is so great we read it again and again."
2,"less interesting than her others, illustrations not as good","We have this book, as well as Prince and the Li Hing Mui, and Sumorella. It's easier to read in that it doesn't have the ""pidgeon"" English that is used in the dialogue two of this authors other books, but I think that ""accent"" is part of what makes Prince and Sumorella fun and unique. This book uses local references like poi and taro and of course musubi, but isn't very interesting otherwise. The illustrator is different than the person who did the other two and the illustrations are not as fun. In fact, I find them a little creepy. The Musubi man is freaky looking and his hair looks, well, like body hair normally under clothing. The eys of all the animals look like they are dilated on street drugs. I would recommend Takayama's other books over this one."
4,Musubi Man: Hawaii's Gingerbread Man,"The depiction of the Hawaiian culture through the art is nice. The storyis unusual to say the least, and unless the children knew the story or poem of the traditional story of the Gingerbread Man, the children would not getthe humor perhaps. It is, however a story with a moral to it and for childrenperhaps age 7 through 9, or 10, it could be enjoyed. The book arrivedpromptly in excellent condition. B. Sahota"
4,A Valuable O.T. Theology Book,J Barton Payne has done an outstanding job on the issue of Soteriology of the Old Testament. Anyone who wants to learn more about O.T. Soteriology should consult Mr. Paynes work. This work is Chirst centered and Christ honoring.
3,Not Originals,These songs are new recordings by the original artists. It doesn't sound as great as the original.
1,Bait and cancel,TGW offered their product at a low price to drive up them up the most active selling list and then cancelled the orders without an explanation.
1,Comfort Trends Massage Lounger,We purchased a Comfort Trends Model CT-20. The thight massage stopped working after l year. We called about warranty and the manufacturer is out of business. NO WARRANTY!
1,COMFORT TRENDS DOES NOT HONOR WARRANTY,"I bought two Shiatsu Massage chairs,one for my wellness center and the other for resale. Bought of them have broken. The customer I sold to could not reach anyone with the company for repair so they called me. I took the back off the chair and discovered that a spring had broken. I replaced the spring and everything was okay until about 2 months later. This time I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. I have fixed my chair once and if mine breaks again and I can't fix it ...well basically I will have bought 2 chairs from this mysterious company that doesn't honor its warranties and can't be reached. I'm very very curious why amazon is selling these chairs and who exactly is behind the selling of them."
1,"Not originals, some not even close","Most of these aren't the original recordings, and some of them aren't even close. ""Crush on You"" has only one singer, and I think was done entirely on one keyboard and a horrible drum machine. ""Rocket 2 U"" is also just plain bad. ""You Got it All"" sounds like the same backing track as the original, but the vocals are from a much older singer. I actually prefer the version of ""Curiosity"" here to the original, but that's just me. In summary, buy the 20th Century Master's version instead."
5,Awesome!,"Biber is an extraordinarily original composer, full of interesting ideas It is pointless to compare him to Telemann: he belongs to a different time and writes in a different style, using shorter forms and more immediate contrast. HAA is virtuoso composition from beginning to end, integrally exploiting the possibilities of the violin like no one else did at the times; and requires superior technical and musical skills from the performers.RFC is up to the task. Its brilliant style of playing perfectly matches the character of the music, and they are able to make the most out of it. This is one uplifting, enthusiastic, and amazing CD from beginning to end."
2,Guilty of the banality when Baroque goes bad.,"I must take exception to the 5-star rating previously given. This music suffers from the worst offense of baroque music, facile ornamentation. Too much of it lacks a center, a ground, and so sounds like a long drawn out series of flourishes (a la Telemann at his worst). When I first heard this album on the radio, I thought that my judgement of Biber based on his ""Battle Music"" was too harsh. I was wrong - I had heard one of the few pieces of any consequence. Almost all of this material is just simply trite.The performance can't be faulted. RFC plays with enthusiasm and creativity. They just picked mediocre material.If you are looking for a Danish pre-Bach baroque composer whose name starts with a ""B,"" stick with Buxtehude: his string sonatas are deep, rich, and always revealing something new."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,I have been using my DMP1 in my car now for a few years. I have since upgraded both the software and the size of the HD. I can fit 1000's of mp3s on it and I could not imagine driving without this. I NEVER listen to the radio anymore because there is no need to when you have your entire music collection at your fingertips!The software provided with the DMP1 is crappy. The GUI is clunky and very limited. The firmware would not allow seeking through songs. I managed to find an alternative open source software upgrade which allows you to be able to seek through songs. The alternative firmware is much faster - it let's you simply use windows explorer to access the HD which makes it much easier to transfer files back and forth to ANY computer with Windows installed. It allows for a simplistic and fast way to shape your music library just the way you want it.I HIGHLY recommend this product!!
5,Great product,"The straightener works great for my long curly hair.Also, the estimated delivery was acurate and the straightener came nicely packed."
5,"Awesome flat iron, but had to return it. My hair was too short. Ouch!!! Great customer service.","Got my hair cut too short and couldn't use the flat iron very well. But, the customer service was awesome. Great communication, fast shipment, etc.Great quality product."
4,Flat iron,"This the best flat iron on the market. For the price, I am so very pleased iwth my purchase. Would recommend to Everyone!!!!"
5,Love it!!!!,"Love it!!! Bought two of these flat irons, one for me and one for my teenage daughter. We both have lots of hair- wavy waist length hair that normally takes forever to straighten. Mind you, we live in an extremely humid climate so frizz and excessive ""poofiness"" is a constant problem. This product tames our hair to a lovely sleek manageable texture in no more than 10 minutes...that's record time for us! The temperature control is great and it heats up and cools down VERY quickly! Awesome product, awesome price!"
5,Love it,"I've never used a flat-iron before, so I don't really have anything to compare this one to...but I was able to straighten all of my thick, almost-elbow-length hair in about 10 minutes, and my daughter's waist-length hair in about five. It heats up very fast, with is a bonus for me because having 3 kids I don't have a lot of time to spend on putting myself together."
3,Too wide..,"I am ok with this product but the only compliant is ,i'm not able to straighten large sections of hair ...its taking lot of time to finish whole hair..i got a very thick hair though :)but its very quick..heats up fast and will be ready in a minute..over all, its an average product.."
3,Plates Don't Touch,"So, after reading all of the excellent reviews on this iron, I purchased it. The item arrived in a timely manner, and I was excited. I opened the box and took the iron out of its packaging. Wo was I when 'trying out' the iron in my hands, I noticed that the plates do not close all the way when you clamp down. :/ The front end was the only spot the plates touched together. The rest of their length was left open by at least a full centimeter. I can see how it would straighten thick, coarse hair just fine. But for my own fine/thin strands, there is just no way this iron could get the job done. So sad. Especially because return shipping is going to be at least $10, so it's like paying $14 just to find out a product doesn't work for you. Ridiculous. I'm entirely bummed."
4,Great price!,Great product! Makes a buzzing noise so I hope thats not a bad thing. Works great so far!! Great price.
5,One of the Greatest Hard Rock Albums of All Time,"If you like Hard Rock, Icon was probably the most unpromoted band that should have made the big time. Very Talented Artist and Tasteful Rock. Definitely check this album out. Singer has an awsome voice and guitarist can really flail."
2,Memory failure...,"I listened a lot to this album when I was a teenager and when I saw that it was released on cd I bought it.What can I say? Time hasn't been kind to this album and it isn't by far as good as I remembered it. It's pop metal, and much more pop than metal. A few songs are still rather good but over all it's nothing to be excited about.If you already have this album (and like it), I suggest you check out TYGERS OF PAN TANG's ""The wreck age"" or ALDO NOVA's first release, since they are much better albums in the same genre."
5,Icon roll the rock,Everybody who like the 80s and 90s rock music should have this icon record. It would rock you all night long
4,Important!,"I'm currently studying from this book, and it has been very helpful, and very thourough. However, I had a Mandarin speaking (yes, he's Chinese), friend of mine look at the book. He laughed. Most of the information is correct, but the usage of Ni and Nin (you informal and ""formal"") is very incorrect. My friend informed me that he has only using Nin once or twice with his parents, and only to suck up. Instead of being more formal, nin is more intimite. He showed me the difference in characters, and the only difference between the two is that nin has the symbol for the heart underneath! There are gross missuses of the word within the book, as in between a student and a teacher. My friend couldn't stop laughing! But other than that, the book is accurate..."
4,Good introduction to the Chinese language,"After completing this book you will have a very rudimentary understanding of the Chinese language. Your vocabulary will be limited, your aural comprehension will be weak at best, and only if you're very studious will you be able to properly pronunciate all the words that you do learn.That said, this is a good book especially when accompanied the audio cassettes. I had no previous knowledge of Mandarin Chinese before reading this book, although the little bit of Cantonese that I know helped somewhat. Now I can pick out a few words here and there when watching Chinese movies. Only with practice will I improve, although a vocabulary builder would be useful."
3,A great help for husbands,I bought this book as per my husband's request and he is very happy with it.
4,Much better than expected!,"For the price I wasn't sure what I was getting, but I was pleasantly surprised! The plastic is good quality and they arrived with no issues. I used chocolate in the molds and the only negative is that they are pretty large and take quite a bit of chocolate and the ears break easy if you don't get enough chocolate in that area. But the finished product looks amazing!!"
2,Leaky Faucet,After less than two years in normal household use faucet began leaking around the stem. Expected higher quality from Kohler.
1,Another Poor Design by Kohler - Rate a 0,"We had this faucet for six years. This faucet was nothing but trouble. The gaskets in the handle base wear out very quickly. Ours needed rebuilding twice in six years. The first plumber that repaired it, flat out told us to plan on replacing it because of these issues. Unfortunately, it is in the landfill now. Our entire home is full of Kohler products and I would not recommend anyone to buy any of them. If your are wanting to waste your money and need more frustration this would be the faucet to buy."
2,Mine also leaks,"I'd like to add my 2 cents worth. I bought and installed this based on Kohler reputation and like some of the other s it started leaking soon after I installed it. I tried tightening the top and other pieces without effect.I haven't talked to Kohler yet, probably will today. If this is a problem with so many and to protect it's name Kohler should re-engineer a permanent solution or give us all credit for a different faucet with the same manufacturer list price.2/27/12 update - I had contacted Kohler and they sent me out a rebuild kit. I installed it and the leak went away. That was shortly after my previous post. Sorry to report that it's leaking badly again. What's that, about a year? I'm sure Kohler will send me anther repair kit. then another, and another, ... It's a real pain and Kohler should arrange a free or discounted replacement."
4,Better than cheaper faucets but still not perfect,I thought I would try a better faucet than the Price Pfister faucets we've been purchasing from Lowes. We were lucky if they lasted a year so I thought I'd give a Kohler a try. The Kohler is easy to install and has a very heavy feeling to it. I really love it but the faucet and the sprayer both drip a little. It's not that bad so I'm just going to live with it.
1,Worst kitchen faucet they keep selling,"I just got off the phone with customer service at Kohler concerning this faucet - 10412-CP Forte. Yes, they know it leaks, but they stand by their warranty and will send you out the same exact faucet. There are no parts to fix the leak, easier just to mail out the same exact faucet and try again and hope it doesn't leak with the same problem. I did this once before. I bought the faucet in June 2011, started leaking in March 2012, they sent the replacement and now 7 months later water is leaking out in the same spot with the new replacement. Looks like faucet only last 6 to 9 months before needing replaced. If you really like this style faucet, do not buy the retail version, go to a professional plumbing supply store and buy the more expensive version. If you don't, you are just setting yourself up for frustration. If you take the chance with this faucet, save the receipt from the store, so you can get your money back when it fails and starts leaking."
2,Pretty but . . .,"Bought faucet because of styling, solid metal costruction, and the Kohler name. Have repaired the faucet twice already in 5 years. Once for ""O"" rings in the swivel neck, once for the leaking valve stem. Kohler has provided free parts for both repairs so customer service is great. It stands behind a poorly-made product. Have installed no-name Home Depot products that are still working fine. Free parts or no fix - you choose!"
1,Pass on this one,"Looks good and worked well, for about a year. Now it leaks around the base below the handle whenever you turn the water on. It seems to be a very common issue. I don't know if any other brands are more reliable, but this one is not."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This faucet was installed on my kitchen sink when i moved in. It did fine for the first year of use. Then it started leaking water from where the handle meets the base. There was constantly a pool of water/sludge sitting around the base of where the faucet meets the sink. I replaced it with the exact same faucet because I didn't know how long the original faucet had been in use and I knew that it would fit. Also, there was a small kid in the house before I moved in, so I factored in that wear and tear and gave Kohler the benefit of the doubt. Spent $150 bucks and a couple of hours replacing the faucet, turn the water back on, and the thing drips. Huge waste of my time, effort, and money."
4,To prevent leakage,"We bought this faucet 5 years ago. It has leaked 3x (every time after the first year it was installed/fixed). We called Kohler and they sent the replacement parts for free. We JUST realized what the true problem was. When assembling the o-rings, bearings, and valve, do NOT use Teflon, plumbers putty, or sealant/lubricant containing petroleum. You MUST use a lubricant sealant (petroleum free of course) all over the o-rings, bearings, and the orange gasket at the bottom of the valve. We applied the lubricant seal excessively and have NOT had a problem since. We are now on our 2nd year leak free! FYI- all the previous years that we replaced the parts, we couldn't see any problem with the parts either.We are now on our 3rd year leak free!"
1,Faulty Faucet - Shame on Kohler,"I went through two of these faucets within one year and had the same problem with both of them! About six months after the first install it lost pressure from the sprayer and water began to leak from the stem. It leaked so bad that my hardwood kitchen floor had a large puddle of water on it when I came home from work. Kohler sent some seals to replace the ""worn"" internal parts, but that did not work. They then sent a replacement which after six months of use it lost pressure from the sprayer and it also began to leak from the stem. I replaced it with a Price Pfister! While Kohler did try to make good on the faulty faucet, it is unlikely that I will trust a Kohler faucet again! This product deserves a zero rating for quality and dependability."
5,Connie May Fowler is a amazing writer,"Attention all Woman, If there is one book that you read, this would be it. It is so romantic that you want to become Sadie and Mima for just a little bit at certain points of the book and if you read this book you will know what I'm talking about."
3,Golden Heart of the Year,"a mildly interesting collaboration between Warn DeFever of His Name Is Alive and Ian masters of Pale Saints. acoustic songs with high pitched vocals that are a bit to twee for my tastes. but there are some interesting little electric elements thrown in the mix once in awhile. my favorite cuts are ""Golden heart Of The Year"" and ""No June."" recommended as a nice treat for fans of HNIA or Pale Saints (obviously) but fans of Glo-worm or Belle & Sebastian might also find some enjoyment in this."
3,J. Holmes got it just about right,Good for fans of Ian Masters or Warren Defever. Hard to find so I just thought I'd chip in two cents.
4,Interesting,"I had a quick browse of the book and I find interesting. I believe it would have been better have a title Improve your thinking rather than teach your child how to think. I found the book to be helpfully to any age.The following captured my interest:&#61623; Difference between, cleverness, wisdom and intelligence&#61623; Perception vs. wisdom and use of logic&#61623; The first rule of Intellectualism If you do not have much to say make it complex as possible.&#61623; Criticism is much easier than creation. It encourages individual creativity even when challenged ."
1,help for a kid,"The content was just too vaguely and monotonously stated. His other book, Six Thinking Hats is excellent. Organized much better, and to the point. Excellent concepts overall."
2,Disappointing,"This record sounds like its cover looks: cheesy and played out. I LOVED the first Burning Brides album, it had the best parts of Nirvana, T-Rex and the Stooges all rolled into one band. I had high hopes for them, but on this record it sounds like they've become a lame hard rock bar band. Full of predictable rock riffs and lyrics this doesn't come near the clever rockingness of old tracks like ""If I'm a Man"". They still play with skill and urgency, but in my opinion the songwriting and hooks just aren't there. Even the couple of decent tracks on this seem like efforts to reach out and say ""Hey look, we ROCK, we're a ROCK BAND!"". I still plan of following these guys but right now they sound like they belong in an 80s biker bar or, best case scenario, an arena."
2,A Sophmore Slump for the Kings!,"The Brides' debut album was as important to rock as the Strokes'(though it never sold nearly as many copies). Both albums rekindling the time Nirvana unleashed Nevermind. While the Strokes sucessfully follwed up their masterpice with ""Room on Fire"", the Brides fell flat on their faces with ""Leave No Ashes"". Except for the title track and the spirited ""Alternative Teenage Suicide"", this album was the biggest dissapointment I could recall since I purchased ""Aint Love Grand"" back in '85 (the brutal release from ""X""). Stick with the debut ""Fall of the Plastic Empire"". Leave ""No Ashes"" wherever you may find it."
2,boring,"I suppose this review is biased because I mainly listen to punk and hardcore, so I'm used to fast, short songs. I got this CD free and I thought it was a punk CD. I found this album boring though. As I said, I'm used to fast, short songs, and these songs were too long and slow for me. But I did like the guitar solo on Pleasure in the Pain and the lyrics on Last Man Standing. But I suggest punx go back to their Dead Kennedys albums."
5,"Good, Good, Good","Okay this is a band that will always be dogged by rock fans for the rest of their lives. And to be honest, the Burning Brides should be hounded by those who critize, because those naysayers cannot do. That 'do' is make a good, balls out rock album. While the last three tracks are good, the rest of the album is great. A kick in the ass for rock (and rock needs it).I have seen these guys live four times since March 2003, when they opened for Audioslave, and Cornell even said: These guys are the f-----g saviors of power trio bands.And he's right."
5,Wow!!!,"Just saw the Burning Brides live about 2 weeks ago, and they torched New York's Bowery Ballroom. I walked into the show having heard one of their songs (""Arctic Snow"" from their last disc), and walked out with both of their CD's. They put on a mindblowingly loud & energetic show. Dimitri Coats attacks his guitar with more vigor than I've seen from anyone in ages, and I've been going to shows since the mid 70's.Their latest disc, Leave No Ashes, is easily one of the best things I've heard this year. It's all here... the big sounds of AC/DC, Cheap Trick, Motorhead, Nirvana and more (including the GBV-like ""From You""), but the Brides are unique enough to pull it all off in the most sincere and original manner. Great band, and I'm sorry I didn't find them much sooner."
4,2000 era grunge? (and more),"I haven't owned this cd for a long long time but from what i've spun i've enjoyed. They are originally from Philadelphia and are straight out rock and roll. What i dig, is they have a Nirvana quality where the lead singer can kind of screech and it still sounds great. I'm always on the prowl for rock and roll where i don't feel like shooting myself in the head and this band will save my skull for the time being.If you aren't ready for newer artists taking a grungey approach, they might not be for you. I am fond of their sound and will likely check out more albums."
3,"In all fairness, they had their work cut out for them","It's such common scenario, it's almost to be expected: band releases an amazing debut, and then lets everyone down with the sophomore and subsequent releases. This is, unfortunately, one of those.""Leave No Ashes"" does have its bright spots, like ""King of the Demimonde"" and the utterly bizarre ""Vampire Waltz"". The remainder is largely forgettable.Their debut, ""Fall of the Plastic Empire"", is a gem, and gets heavy rotation in my listening. Buy that album, not this one.This band IS a treat to see live, however. Don't miss em."
2,Fair,"The author has a charming flair, but quite trite at times.The story is filled with cliche's, that grew wiresome at times.I won't recommednd it, but a so so read!"
4,We've used these a lot.,"We looked for a long time for some teency little dessert spoons. The price on these was great! I wouldn't call them really fancy or stylish, but they are really useful. Our toddler (now that she feeds herself) uses them all the time, for cold cereal, cut up spaghetti, whatever. They work just like a real spoon but get her the right size of bites. Also, now we eat ice cream from custard cups instead of cereal bowls, and these are great b/c they don't fall out of the cups. Also, small bites, serving lasts longer, etc. They're a lot of fun. Not at all fancy, but they clean up nicely in the dishwasher. Oh yeah, they're also my new favorite spoon for eating grapefruit! The sides are not rounded at all so they scrape the sections out really well, and it's just the right size to fit into the sections without mashing the grapefruit walls. As long as you don't want these for any special occassion I recommend them pretty well."
5,"Ziwich is good at German style, too!","My previous acquaintance with the work of Fred Ziwich and the International Sound Machine was with his tributes to Frank Yankovic, Kenny Bass, and Johnny Pecon -- Slovenian (or Cleveland) style polkas. In this CD he proves he has a good feel for the German polka style as well. The string bass is replaced, as it should be, with a tuba. It sounds authentic, although I suspect the tuba is an electronically simulated one, because no one can play the tuba with as much precision as it is played here! The Lichtensteiner Polka is sung in both German and English, the first time I have ever heard it this way. I have now heard Happy Wanderer, In Heaven There Is No Beer, and a few of the others, in both German and Slovenian style. I like both. There are a couple of marches, too. This CD is top-notch."
5,Perfect Experience,"The product came in perfect condition, sooner than I had expected and was exactly what it was supposed to be. I could not ask for a better experience. I wish everything was this simple."
5,Quality,"I was so impressed with the quality of this item, especially with the reasonable pricing. It was the perfect cake topper for my daughter's wedding."
2,Test Drive 6 is a wannabee Need for Speed,"Test Drive graphics are ok but even after hitting the wall 100 times your car still looks shiny and new.The sound is great with very catchy music.The levels could be alot better designed and it looks a bit dense and shallow.Test Drive 6 has a pretty good car selection of hot rods but you should be able to modify your cars a bit more.The cop chase mode is pretty cool but you should be able to pick more police cars.The control is horrible and handling a Dodge Viper seems like a chore.After playing this a game a few times the fun just went dead.There should be more modes and I don't know if Test Drive 6 is a poor simulation racing game or a poor arcade racing game.If you want an arcade racing game buy Speed Devils or if you want a racing simulation game buy Tokyo Extreme Racer or wait for Sega Gt.I would not even recommend a rent ,trust me don't waist your time"
1,Worst game ever!,"When I first bought this, i thought it was going to be a really good game because of the licineced cars and everything but when i bought it, i soon realized that this was a total wate of money! The graphics are N64 style and it has no real car physics , horrible soundtrack. This game is just a total waste of money!"
3,"Decent, if slightly unpolished racer","While Test Drive 6 does have a fair amount of fun, it really doesn't seem like it was very polished. There's very noticable decrease in framerate and shortcuts in the physics when it starts really pushing the hardware (for instance, a lamppost that would have stopped you in your tracks otherwise has no effect on your path).Also, the steering is irritatingly sensitive. Without suspension/tires upgrades, you tend to slide all over the place, but if you upgrade, the steering becomes ridiculous. You can attempt to compensate by changing your playing style and using the ability to adjust braking for understeer, but it's still an inadequate solution.That said, this is still a fun and attractive racer, it just lacks the special something to really engage me."
4,"great game, bad sound","i wasnt sure what game i would want for christmas. i knew i wanted a racing game. i didnt want sega rally 2 because im not into 2 minute races and no depth. im glad i went with test drive 6. the graphics are what i expected from the dreamcast. but it would have been nice if they were a little better. the control took a while to get right. i had to adjust the suspension on all my cars so they would turn good enough. but once i got them right, i couldnt lose, but it was still challenging. the only big problem i found was the sound. the effects werent realistic at all, they seemed a little sparse too."
1,Oh God!! Not again.....,"I hated the same game in the Playstation and the same creators could not improve the game in the much more POWERFUL sega Dreamcast.What a Pity and huge Surprise!!!!!This game does not reach ur expectations.For God`s sake don`t even think to buy this game.The cars don`t SEEM to be cars AT ALL.If u r expecting any BANGS from Dreamcast games ,then go for Test Drive Le Mans,or Ferrari355 Challenge,or Metropolis Street Racing......And never look back to 3rd class games like Test Drive6 or Roadsters or Monaco Grand Prix or F1 world grand prix.first read the reviews and then think and then buy the game u need..."
3,Boring.........,"I got this game not to long ago and I already have gotten tired of it. It's a good game in all, but it's just too boring after a while. A word of advice: Dont play it for hours a day, play about an hour a day, or you'll soon get bored of it. It dosen't have a big selection of tracks and the music gets boring after a while. The other bad thing about it is that they made it way too easy, even if you put it on hard. BUT they have great cars, graphics and it's pretty realistic. I say you should rent it and see if you like it, if you do, buy it."
3,Back to 32-bit,"When I first played this game on playstation, it was ok. But after I played it on Dreamcaster my jaw dropped. The graphics are the same;everthing. No net play, nothing. The cars don't feel right, but good sound. The game has some of pros. and alot of cons. I listed alot of the cons. above, but its fun. Its fun to bluid up your car. All tho the game is cheap, i would save ... and get Test Drive; La Mans or Test Drive; V-Rally."
3,Where are the dents and scratches?,"Test Drive 6 has amazing graphics, which should be expected. Also the scenery was well done, but what happened to all the dent's and scratches when you've been side-swiped or hit a bump going 180 MPH and smash into a wall. I think that it would be a much better game if they had included damage to the exterior which would make you a more cautious driver. In turn, would make the game more fun and difficult."
1,I expected more.,"The graphics in this game are pretty good, as you would expect on the Dreamcast, but the rest of the game is a dissappointment. Most of the tracks seem as narrow as bike paths and have walls on both sides which make the player feel like a mouse moving through a maze. The cars don't feel like real cars, and they seem to steer from the rear wheels and not the front. After playing SPEED DEVILS this game feels like Pole Position 2. If you want a racing game that looks and feels awesome pick up SPEED DEVILS."
4,Test Drive 6 Very Good Dreamcast Game,"I just purchased Test Drive 6 last night and I am really enjoying the game. The graphics and gameplay are very good. I haven't gotten too far into the game yet (I am still racing Class 1 cars), but I like the betting model that the game uses for racing. Basically you wager a certain number of credits in order to enter a race and then the top 3 finishers win a portion of the purse. The only drawback to the game seems to be that the framerate tends to slow down a little more than I would like, although by no means does it significantly detract from the enjoyment of the game. If you are looking for a very solid racing game I would recommend Test Drive 6."
2,Not a Sim/Not Arcade,"The editorial review is right on. This is too hard for the Arcade Race fans (say people who like Daytona USA) and too inaccurate for Sim Race fans (Gran Turismo fans).Consequently, you get a game not likely to make anyone happy. Doesn't take advantage of the Dreamcast capabilities very well. Looks like a PS1 game.Pass on this one."
3,Could Have Been Better,Test Drive 6 is good in some ways a terrible in others. The game offers good cars to race with but there are only six cars. You can drive cop cars which is fun for a while but soon gets boring because there are only four cop cars. The graphics do not test the limits of the wonderful Dreamcst. The game is very slow. You would be going faster on a trisicle than you would racing cars on this game. THE HANDLING IS TERRIBLE. You are constantly hitting walls and running into lightposts. You might want to rent it but you do not want to buy it.
3,Barely Fine and ok!,"The traffic is a pain because most of the time the normal cars swerve into you and you loose your huge lead. This game has stuff like poor turning and traction espesialy Saleens,vipers,and toyota gt1s.The only tourament I can win is class1 tour 1 because the other tours are way to hard. Your very lucky if you win the first race in class1. There are even cars that only have a top speed of 130 with bad turning and very poor acelaration and average traction, then you look back going 152 mph and then woosh they speed right past you making your car go spinning out of control. Thats messed up because your going 152 and he's only going 130 right!? This game is barely OK. I recommend SegaSports 2k,2k1,2k2,and2k3!"
1,Oldies But Goodies - K-Tel Entertainment,This cd was definitely not what I expected. I have other Oldies But Goodies cd's and they're great. There is only one original song on this cd and that's the title track. The rest are just terrible! I didn't get to open until after the holidays and the 30 day time period had lapsed for returns. Very disappointed....Don't waste your time or money on this one.
2,Decent but not great picture quality,"If you are looking for a camera that has everything you need to transfer movies to your computer this is NOT it. It WILL work if you get the cable and you use a software suite such as Nero (that often comes w/ DVD burners)- but these things don't come with the camera. The size of the camera is great as well as the battery life. The biggest problem, and an important one at that, is that we found this camera to have a dark picture- picture was a bit grainy and pixely and especially poor performance in low lighting. Battery life & size were not good enough to sacrifice sharp picture quality and bright picture & colors."
1,OK Starter Video Camera,"I have owned this camera for several years now. It still captures video and I can retrieve digital video off of it from my computers running Ubuntu Linux. My major complaint was that the view screen quit on me after about a month of owning it, thank goodness for the built-in old-school viewfinder. The video quality is rather poor, but may be fine for some as a basic starter camera."
5,Excellent Service!,Love this camera! I have two of them for my video business.It has all the hook ups I needed and does an excellent job for a small camera. Would order from again.
1,Impossible to download videos,"I have tried everything. Firewire, USB. There was an insert in the guide that mentioned that you have to connect the cable first to your PC then to your camera, then turn on the PC then turn on the camera...then wait for the stars to align in the right order. If you do anything in a different order then your camera can get damaged. What kind of a crazy world does Panasonic live in?Well, I followed the instructions to the tee, downloded the right drivers and all and yet my PC does not recognize the GS19 or the GS9. I have used both. The GS19 is a new purchase so this is definitely going back. I thought, this model would have gone away with the kinks but, NO!So, my panasonic recorded DVs are gonna remain on the tape. I will never be able to put them on DVDs. What a joke, this camera turned out to be."
3,Super Dense Reading,"This book has some great content. However, getting into can be very difficult as the writing is so dense and hard to sink your teeth into. Definitely not a Donald Miller style writer. However, as said, the material is very good and challenges you to ponder some great questions. The chapter titles should be good enough to entice most readers.The great thing is... there is a new version/edition of the book just printed in 2005. It is co-written by someone else (sorry can't remember) and comes at the discussion from a more 'American' point of view rather than British. From looking it over, it is practically a whole new book, completely rewritten but maintaining the same chapter titles. This is the book I wish I had purchased and I was a little upset that Amazon did not inform me of the update. Too bad.For the content, the book gets at least a 4.5. For the readability, scartching at a 2."
1,Shooting Your Own Foot,"Did Gibbs or any of the audience he is targeting stop to think that they are trying to ""save"" or salvage something that longs for change. God is a God of love - period. There are many paths to love and to make another wrong is to live in the arrogance and ignorance of a belief system that the world is flat, that women are to be subsurvient, and that particular races are less refined than others. All beliefs that were KEY when the Bible was scribed. If you are willing to except the change of these things, why can't you see that what was heresy (holistic practises, herbs)hundreds of years ago is now recognized for its value today. Stop trying to ""fix"" people from expansion and personal growth. The experience of God is wondrously beyond definition."
3,Not loving this,"I love clover products so gave this a try. It opens like a lipstick container. At the top of the ""lipstick"" tube is a slit. You rub the top on the fabric and loose chalk comes out of the slit and marks the fabric. Seems I need to run the tube several times over the fabric to make a clear mark. Will just buy a chalk cube to replace this one."
4,AWESOME!!,"GREAT QUALITY, GREAT PRICE. I AM REALLY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE. I AM A NEW CUSTOMER AND HAD A GREAT EXPERIENCE"
3,The Mini Terminators are coming .,"Mini -terminators , time travelling and old foes from season three , that's what you're going to get in the fourth season of Dragon Ball Z , plus the usual boring filler episodes ,which are gathered up in episodes - like the Garlic Jr. Episodes , Krillin's proposal and Goku in driving school - that are , thankfully , not interfering with the original story line from the manga .The box set is the same fold in box with six CD's , the first three CD's contain six episodes , CD's four and five, five episodes and the last one four episodes plus trailers .Good news for filler episodes haters , Toei Animation is going to release Dragon Ball Kai , an Akira Toriyama cut of Dragon Ball Z in Japan April the fifth , where the filler episodes will be taken out of the show . I hope Funimation gets the rights to this special edition ."
5,must buy to complete collection!,"if you already purchased any of the previous seasons, i highly recommend buying this one too. its vital because it adds on to the story and the history of cell, trunks, and the androids.i'd give you further information about the dvd but i dont want to spoil the excitement =)"
3,reviewed,my son likes it. he and his friends have spent numerous hours watching it. i would recommend this product to others
4,Dragonball Z Season 4,It is good to complete the saga. But you will probably only watch it once or twice. So buy it cheap or rent it.
5,DBZ Season 4,Dragon ball Z season 4 is about garlic jr coming back for revenge. after things start calming down Trunks comes and tells them about the androids coming in three years after he defeats freeza.
5,Ever reliable Amazon!,"Thankyou Amazon!Being from Australia, it can be quite stressful purchasing items from overseas but..Amazon makes the world seem like a much smaller place. My sons were delighted that the DragonBall DVDs turned up ahead of expected arrival date, all in perfect condition!! Thankyou again Amazon for making it all so hassle free. The DVDs are being thoroughly enjoyed :)Dragon Ball Z: Season One (Vegeta Saga)"
3,Son loves series but disapoointed,"My son loved receiving this item for his brithday, but in season one they sent two disk number 2 so he hasn't been able to enjoy it fully. :("
4,I'm Getting a Bit Agitated,"I'm a bit disappointed with these releases. Not by the widescreen, but the dubbing and the music.First off, the characters of Muron and Android 19 had their voices dubbed much differently, which was a bit shocking to me. I also disagree with the continuing lack of Bruce Faulconer's famous soundtrack that plays a greater role when Trunks and the Androids appear. I'm sure many fans could agree with me so far.I'd also like to point out that season 5 will have only 26 episodes! That's twenty seven episodes short of ending the Cell saga off including Trunk's departure to his own time. I guess Season six will be the Cell Games Saga. I'm pretty sure they will only allow 27 episodes and save Season 7, 8 and possibly 9 for the Saiyaman and Buu Sagas. Unbelievable. The only reason I will continue to buy these sets is because I have gone along this far. So sorry fans, but I'm just as angry as you are."
4,Not so bad...,"I agree that this is a decent CD, provided you don't pay too much for it. I got mine used for $4 signed by Mark Lindsay, so it was a nice deal. The musicians are really tight, so this isn't a sloppy treatment of the music, and they are pretty close to the original arrangements, so you don't have a young rocker studio musician getting all ""heavy metal"" with the ""Just Like Me"" guitar solo. For example."
2,Critique of CD,All-Time Greatest HitsVery Disappointed. I thought they were original tracks but they were not. There needs to be more clarification on these types of products.
1,Badly recorded live junk,"NOT the originals - these tracks sound like bootleg live recordings. Poor quality. Don't buy this one, even in the discount bin."
3,Toads Review of 1984 soundtrack by the eurythmics,"read the book in english listened to the soundtrack thereafter, its based off the 1984 version of ""1984"" the movie, that based on orwells book, thought the Soundtrack did the movie justice, but I wouldnt pay 14 to 16 bucks for it depending on amazons shipping charge, they need to make this a 9.99 cd, unless your big on 80's dance music or a diehard eurythmics fan, I wouldnt pay this much for it"
5,Fantastic album,"I don't know why this album was so under-rated. I guess it's not as ""main stream"" as some other Eurythmics albums, but it's essential listening material for anybody who likes Eurythmics. It's not an album I would ever want to be without. I guess being an Orwell AND Eurythmics fan, makes it all the more compelling."
5,The Best Album of All Time,"Maybe not of all time, but certainly the best Eurythmics album: to think that I was put off by savage reviews (not to mention the controversy surrounding the movie director's refusal to use any of the music in the film) and the first single, ""SexCrime."" I didn't buy it, the first time I didn't buy a new Eurythmics album. Fortunately, a friend of mine had better taste and let me listen to his. I was immediately awed by the haunting, beautiful music, and have branded it my favorite Eurythmics album ever since. ""Julia"" gets frequent mention, of course, as it should, but check out ""For the Love of Big Brother"" or ""Winston's Diary."" Music that stands the test of time; elements from this album are strewn throughout most pop music today.If you buy one album this year, make it this one."
2,Misses the mark.,"As someone new to canning, I was left with lots of unanswered questions after reading this book. She skips some very basic questions to the novice and leaves you scratching your head. I would not recommend it to anyone new to the subject"
4,Good start.,"My son has really been getting into space, so I got him this telescope for Christmas. It looks good, and it is small -- perfect for little kids. Only reason it is 4 stars is because it is a little blurry, which is fine since it is just a starter telescope."
3,Somewhat Neutral,"From past experiences I have used many types of wrenches, and I have found one prevailing truth, and I am sure many mechanics will agree. When working with tightening, and loosening nuts, it is best to use 6-point box wrenches on 6-point nuts. Why? A 12-point box wrench, or 12-point socket wrench can strip the corners of nuts when trying to loosen stubborn nuts.In turn a ruined nut, then the nut has to be replaced once you are able to remove it. Added time, added expensees. Do your repair right the first time.SK makes excellant automotive tools, the quality is second to none, just make sure you have the correct tool for the job."
4,Just fine,"In perfect condition- my favorite part, however, is the goodwill sticker on the back priced at $1.00. Good job on the up sale :)"
5,loving through heartsongs,this book has brought me to tears several times and I'm just half way thru it.
4,Amplifier Works Nicely,"Bought the item to power 2 JBL JRX125 speakers through a Mackie mixer. I was running these speakers with a 50 watt amp, so with this 800 watt amp I was expecting quite a bit more volume. It gives me what I need for a medium size gig, but not a bunch extra like I was hoping for - but it's still a very nice product. Guess I need to up the wattage if I want to blow eardrums."
1,Cute But Useless,"I love the color and size of this cute little pink mouse, but as for function, it's useless. I've had mine for 2 months and with regular use, I'm already having it replaced.The mouse is a perfect size for me but the miniature wheel is hard to get a handle on. The mouse itself is approximately 3.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. TINY which worked well for my small hands but could prove problematic for someone with a larger hand.The one star is for Customer Service regarding the mouse. I was able to get through to Targus easily and use their 1 year warranty to get the product replaced.If you're looking for something cute and ornamental that you will use occasionally, this mouse might be okay but if you plan to actually use it for everyday functions, get a heartier mouse. This one won't last and you can pay a similar amount of money for a very good mouse, though unfortunately, it probably won't be pink which is obviously the biggest selling point on this particular mouse."
2,"Disappointed, yet pleased","The music was fun listening, however, the one title I was/am looking for is more of the original vocal song, rather than the music only song. I am keeping the product though, but will continue to look for the original recording of the particular song I want."
2,I Wanted All Original Tunes!,"Only five of these songs are original recordings (Tracks 4,5,7,14 and 18)so if you are looking for all original recordings;pass on this one."
2,Trite,"There are only two or three photographs of creative weddings in this book. The rest are grand and tacky and not at all special. The text is well written and offers a real, but shallow perspective of the stresses and family issues that will arise."
2,Save your money,"Town & Country has a GREAT website (though I'm not sure if it's affiliated with this book), but this book is lacking in all respects. The ideas, photography, etc. are barely average, although the price surpasses it's worth. Save your money and find the Town & Country website."
2,There are better,"If you are looking for a lush coffee table book, be prepared to deal with less than perfect printing. Many of the images are muddy and or grainy. Definately flip through it at the store, but don't make it your one and only."
1,Total Suck,"The html/flash interface to the cdrom is lame. The ""ebook"" is a kludged up crippled drm fest such that the ""pdf"" is not viewable without installing crippleware and can't even be viewed WITH the crippleware unless it is accessed from a CDROM.If I had the time, I could hack this stupid thing, but it's not worth the effort. I would like to be able to view it at work (NetBSD) or on my other computer (Linux) but can't. Simply can't, even if I tried to install the malware.There are numerous broken links, the book is referred to by the wrong title.How can I trust a study guide that is such junk in such obvious ways.I hate this product. Don't buy this."
3,BAD PAPER STOCK USED,"I just received the book and it looks like it has the content. But I must say that the paper stock used is appalling. I have seen toilet paper thicker than this paper and its already yellowing. You can see the print on the other side of the page! The print and screen shots are so small, maybe they are trying to save paper? I almost considered returning it, but it does have the content. I don't think after the exam you can use this book for a reference since it should have deteriorated by then."
4,Clear and easy to understand,"Good description, but the chapter arrangement sometimes is a bit difficult to follow when trying to match with Oracle's exam topic. The CD (flash card, practice exam) would be very useful if it can be used on Unix/Linux too"
5,Dogs Deserve Dialogue...by Judy Moore,"I have read Judy's book, seen her video, met her when she came to Milwaukee in 2001 to work with two dogs, and this year in May 2002 when she gave a wonderful presentation at the Wisconsin Humane Society talking about some of her successes which are also mentioned in her book. She did a live demonstration and as a volunteer at the facility, I received so much positive feedback from attendees. The book has helped friends of mine who recently acquired dogs and one person in particular refers to Judy's book as his ""bible"" when working with his dog. As a dog walker, Judy's book has helped me work with the dogs I walk at the shelter. The book is so worthwhile to every dog owner, both new and those who have had dogs, and this book should be associated on Amazon with other dog-related books (whether training or pleasure reading).Thank you."
2,Expected a lot,"This book really was a disappointment, the training methods are traditional, just pulling and pushing the dog into positions and even choking the dog for 5 seconds if it behaves aggressively."
2,Fan of NB but not the 901 series!,"I like the style of 901 NB very much. Shoes are light, sturdy and highly visible. They are also very stable. Unfortunately for me the shoes don't offer enough cushioning. I walk/run 3-5 times a week for about 1hr. at the time. Even though, I had the shoes for several months,at the end of the week I had blisters on my heels from the lack of weight absorption. I have decided to replace the inserts with ones made by LifeFitness to see if this improves the comfort. I walk mostly on gravel roads.I don't have any type of drama with my other pair- NIke Free 7.0 which are extremely soft and easy on the feet but not as durable as NB.Overall, NB are well made shoes that fall short on heel cushioning in my opinion."
4,Light Running Shoes,"I Really Like my new Pair of running shoes. They are very light, and breathe good.This is my 4 th pair of NB running shoes, another good set are the 991's if you can still find them.-T-Worcester, Ma"
3,"Okay, but not great","This is an okay book about modern kustoms, but most of the cars photographed are too untraditional to be considered ""Lead Sleds."" Most of the cars, including the Caddy on the cover, are of a more street-rod style that was popular a few years back. If you're interested in traditional kustoms I recommend ""Barris Customs of the 1950s"" instead. If you already own a lot of custom car books (like I do), then this isn't a bad addition. Just be prepared to cringe when the author refers to a car with a Hagan frenched headlight kit and rasberry paint as ""a classic custom that could have rolled out of the 1950s""."
3,Decent,"Pros: Good amount of dust, cheap, my hamster likes it.Cons: Condition upon arrival was surprisingly bad: the box was old, worn, and torn at the edges.I suggest buying from a different vendor, although the product itself is useful and I recommend it overall for cleaning small pets."
2,Warning: poorly packaged. Dwarf hamster didn't like it.,"It came in a very thin Ziploc bag full of holes. A higher quality Ziploc bag would have held it together well, but this was the flimsiest thing I've ever seen.. It made such a mess when I transferred it over into a jar. My dwarf hamster sniffed it and walked away. I left it there for a few days, but he never used it. I'm giving it two stars because it probably works for other, larger animals."
5,This stuff is great,"The order came on time and in good condition. My 2 gerbils really enjoy taking dust baths in this stuff and they definately look soft and shiny when their done. They do occasionally knock some dust out of their ""bath"" but i put a tissue under it so all I have to do is pick that up and it doesn't leave dust in their cage."
4,Oreo loves his bath!,"Our hamster, Oreo, a Russian White Dwarf, LOVES his bath. It's so cute to watch him wiggle around in the stuff! Now he wiggles around in the ""tub"" even when there is no bath powder (I feel sorry for him then, poor baby)."
4,It's Great!!!,Paleoworld is kinda cheap when it comes to graphics but it's a great series of documentaries about the lives of prehistoric animals.
3,"Good cordless, but not as good as the rest of the V28 line","I love Milwaukee V28 tools. I own most of the line. See my review of the combo pack.Ironically, the most disappointing tool of the bunch is the Sawsall. It cuts OK, and the battery life is very good, but with a lot of vibration. The thing buzzes violently even if you run it without a blade.I've not owned any Milwaukee Sawsalls before. My corded recip saw is a Porter Cable Tiger saw, and it is much more comfortable to use, with way less vibration, and it has an orbital function as well. It also seems to have much more power than this V28 tool (the only v28 tool I notice is down on power compared to corded). Perhaps I'm just spoiled.Anyway, I love the blade chuck of the V28 sawsall - quick blade changes are easy.So I'll give it 3 stars, because it does work, but it's not up to par with the rest of the V28 line."
4,USB Mini Aquarium,"For what it is its great. Its great how you can plug it into a usb port to power it. It will also run on batteries if you choose. My only complaint about it is if you have batteries in it and its plugged into the usb port on your computer you cannot turn it off. You can only change the switch from usb to batteries. So if you do have it plugged into a usb port you need to leave the batteries out to turn it off. They needed to install a 3 way switch, with the three positions being batteries, off, and usb. With that said though I have gotten many smiles from it at work and I never have to feed the fish or change the water :)"
2,Fishy aren't fishy,"The main problem that takes away from this neat idea is the fact that the fish only travel in one pattern: a vertical circle. This is understandable because you have a simple motor stirring the water. On USB the fish travel quickly in a vertical circle, on battery a slower vertical circle. I just wish the fish would bounce around the little tank instead of this repeating path. Others may not mind, but it was a bit of a letdown for me."
3,Contains Flouride,Has the same amount of flouride as any name brand toothpaste. I was hoping it didn't have any flouride as there has been research indicating flouride causes gums to shrink...
1,didn't worked for me,"I had swollen and bleeding gums, thought it would work based on some reviews for this product. Unfortunately, my swollen gums kept progressing and worse, when sores started coming out, felt stinging burn every time I used this product. So I switched to another brand and boy, what a difference, no stinging burn and my gums looked and feel better now."
4,Got what I paid for...,"Generally, I find that hardback copies are far better than paperback. There was nothing wrong with the copy. Just cheap, as you'd expect. The story is okay, but in my opinion, not a great lesson on tattling."
1,Fantastic while it worked (brief time),"I had only used this immersion blender infrequently, for soups mostly, and with the chopper attachment to produce vinaigrettes (chop the shallot first, then add the rest to it and give it a whirl), and sometimes to chop nuts. The chopper attachment was the first to go - blade would just not whirl, and then sometimes with the nuts one of them would just get stuck against the bowl, wedged by the blade. Shortly thereafter, no blade movement at all. Then the actual blender attachment had the same issue. I would hear the motor running, whirring away, but the blender attachment sounded like there was some major mechanical problem - like metal was rubbing on metal the wrong way. I am so angry about this purchase (did not get it with Amazon, and promptly lost my receipt post-purchase). So I am throwing it away, and am going to get a Kitchenaid. I doubt I'll get anything with the Cuisinart name on it again (already have the food processor - no problems there yet)."
5,Cuisinart Smart stick hand blender,"This is a great product. Fortunately made of metal, not plastic. Has some great attachments too! My wife was very pleased with it."
1,Cuisinart should remove this unit from the market!,Do not buy this unit! This is just wrong for Cuisinart to put out such a bad design. The plastic connector in the motor head strips and leaves the unit and all the accessories useless.
2,Designed to Fail,"Save your money. After 1 year of normal use, the stripped teeth that engage with the motor faid. There goes 50USD down the drain.Happy with the product while it lasted.Now I am going to buy a handheld blender without any attachments."
1,Junk,"The first two or three time I used it, it ran great and did every thing I need. But when I try to make bread crumbs the blade just stopped running. Tried the other attachment and would not run also. It looks like the gears are striped right out."
4,nice product,I bought this as a gift. It was much less expensive than the same one at Macy's. It arrived quickly and I have heard it works great.
2,repaint your kitchen?,The product is okay in my experience except when using the whisk. This is due to the fact that it has one setting; light speed splatter.
1,Broke immediately,"The SECOND time I used this, it started smoking and burning up. I was pulsing some herbs - not mixing cement. I am returning this and getting my money back. Terrible product."
4,Easy-to-use-favorite-tool,"Easy to clean too. Small, but mighty! Gifted my mom and friends for Christmas. They love it too. My Aunt raves about it too."
5,a must have,Just the best! Changed the way I cook in the kitchen.The only way to make soup now. Very nice.
4,Love the chopper,"I wanted one of these for a long time. Works great for blending in the pot. The chopper is also a boon for chopping small amounts & is easy to clean. I added this to my family of cuisinart products, food processor, juicer, mini mate. all have me great service over the years."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought two of these from a dept store approx 6 months ago. One for me to replace a Braun that the blender cup housing had cracked (after 4 years and countless smoothies) and one for my mother who listened to me rave about these things for making smoothies much easier than traditional blenders. The motor failed on both of ours within weeks of each other. Thank god I still had the Braun, but only with the stick attachement that works flawlessly still. Im shopping for another one right now, but I had to stop for a second to throw this hunk of trash under the bus where it belongs. Dont do it."
4,excellent blender,I am very pleased with this blender. Does everything i need and more. I haven't even used 1/10th of it's abilities and i am already impressed
3,Fun while it lasted,"We had this blender for over a year before the teeth stripped and it stopped working. We used it daily for a time making smoothies (no ice--it doesn't do ice). One I got the hang of it the whisk was great for beating up eggs; it didn't really beat them to a fluff, but it was enough for most of my recipes. I splattered the kitchen with eggs several times before I got the hang of it. I even made hummus in the food processor, albeit in small batches. I think when I buy another immersion blender I will find one with a better track record and maybe without changeable heads--really smoothies and soups are all I need."
1,Major design flaw!,"After 6 months of normal use, the chopper attachment has ceased to function and the blender stick has begun to fail intermittently. I don't know how much longer it will be before the whole setup becomes useless. The problem is, as other reviewers have noted, the stripped plastic teeth on the part that connects the motor to the attachments. I don't understand why anyone would make a product with a great motor, metal body, and well-designed attachments only to make the most important part of the whole setup out of cheap plastic. Once the teeth on this part are stripped, the machine is rendered useless. It was great while it lasted, though. When fully functional, the blender attachment was capable of making thick hummus as quickly as effectively as a food processor and reducing rock hard frozen bananas to delicious smoothies in minutes. If the connector piece was more durable this blender would be perfect, but unfortunately the design flaw makes it useless within months."
1,Broken after 1st use!,"Well, I couldn't believe it! I used the chopper attachment once to grind some hazelnuts to a butter according to instructions in the booklet. The next time I went to use it the thing wouldn't move! Unbelievable for a supposedly good brand..."
5,Wonderful kitchen tool!,My brother in law raved about this product so I had to get it for myself. I LOVE everything about it! The best part is being able to process right in the cooking pot - soups and sauces are instantly blended. No more having to process in batches in a food processor. This is an awesome kitchen tool and you can't beat the price either!
1,Broke in 4 months,"The plastic part which spins broke in 4 months and now it doesn't work. For the first four months, I loved it."
1,Not Cuisinart! Oh no!!!,"Such a shock! Used a friend's brand new Cuisinart (first use out of the box) to make a smoothie and WHAM! I couldn't believe what I saw! Nothing was blending. Then the smell started. Yep! striped teeth! I have an old hand blender from many years ago and it has never been a problem so I sure wasn't expecting this fancy Cuisinart to do anything so badly, but was I wrong. I had to go out and replace my friend's Cuisinart of course, with a Miallegro 9090 Mitutto 550-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, Professional-style (based on the great reviews) just to make sure we didn't get taken again. Can't believe Cuisinart has stooped to such a low. LOVE the Mitutto!"
1,Piece of Crap,"The product is a piece of crap please dont buy it. We bought it about 2 monts back from Macys and now it has the same problem that everyone here is complaining about. Trust us this problem is very real and the striped teeth really break rendering the entire unit worthless. There is no way to fix the unit, it is a fundamental design flaw.The motor unit on the top attaches and is able to turn the blender and the blades below using the 2 teeth in the bottom pieces. There are notches in the main motor unit in which these teeths fit.How can they expect 2 think plastic teeths to bear the entire force of turning the blades and chopping through food? I think this is a very stupid engineering decision. And no matter how many units they replace they can never fix this problem.I used to trust Cuisinart but I guess there quality is going down...."
2,poor construction,"I like the concept of this product, but like others with complaints, this product broke after just a few uses. The teeth that connect the motor base to the attachments are made of plastic and have stripped down and will not work. It is now totally useless. Seems like a lot of other people have had the same or similar experience."
1,Good idea but poor quality,"When I first purchased this item from Costco, I thought it was great. The parts snapped together easily and it worked very well. I mostly used the chopper about once or twice a week. It lasted about a year and started having problems. I read online the the gears inside the main assembly stripped and that the gear assembly was poorly designed. I don't know about the inner workings of the item, but none of the parts work at all now. I have not abused it, immersed it in water, or anything else that would cause this problem. Realize that if you purchase this item, you many be buying another in about a year. Fortunately, for my I kept my old mini chopper which still works.Cuisinart Smart Stick Hand Blender with Whisk, Mixing Beaker, and Chopper Attachments"
1,Planned obsolescence!,"Really poor quality item...dont buy if you plan on using it much! I might use it once or twice a month at the most, its only a year old and the plastic parts where motor and accessories meet are stripped making it completely useless. Replacing the motor is almost the price of the whole thing; planned obsolescence anyone?!"
4,Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender makes a splash,The hand stick blender pulverizes soup contents in seconds - great split pea or carrot ginger soup. I tried the chopper attachment on nuts with the dull side leading (didn't realize there were two blade settings) and it just made a sound and didn't chop the nuts (I gave up and chopped by hand). Haven't tried the whisk (I use my mixer attachment for this purpose) Would be happy with the stick blender without the attachments that take up some awkward storage space. My hand is too small to easily grip the top of the chopping bowl for removal.
1,Too small,"Returned this item back to the store on the very next day. It is quite cumbersome, and the blending bowl is too small, even for my breakfast yogurt-banana smoothie (in comparison with my previous hand blender from Braun). I honestly do not understand the reasoning behind this design."
2,Don't buy this item,"I bought the cuisinart stainless steel hand blender one year ago -- and what a lousy kitchen appliance it is! From the beginning the motor was pretty weak, the stainless steal whisk twisted out of shape several times, and after a year the whole unit is so weak I can't even beat egg whites to stiff peaks! Cuisinart has come a long way DOWNHILL in terms of quality from the cuisinart food processor I bought 15 years ago! I am ready to try other brands."
1,Piece of Junk Mixer....DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This mixer has so many problems (see previous Amazon reviews) I do not have the time to comment on them now. I want to report that the motor portion of the mixer is now stripped after 4, thats right, FOUR uses. There is a plastic housing around the gear shaft, which drives the attachments. It cannot operate any attachments now that the housing is stripped. I always attached it and cleaned it properly, so my thoughts are this product is a lemon and I will NEVER buy anything with Cuisinart on it."
1,Plastic shaft snapped after 6 months,"I see that I'm not the only one who had this happen to them. I used the hand blender maybe a total of 8 times before the plastic shaft that drives the attachment snapped and rendered the appliance completely useless. Stay away from it. It looks nice with the stainless steel and all, but the motor parts are cheap, obviously."
2,love and hate,"Got this as a gift. I enjoy and the immersion blender and the food processor. I thought I would use the whisk all the time, as I always make my own whipped cream. I LOVED the whisk attachment, LOVED it! But after 5 uses, it didn't work any more, seemed like it stripped the gears. Huge disappointment."
1,bummer,The teeth inside of the motor section - where the attachment meets the motor - disintegrated on my 4th time using the thing. Warranty department will send me a new motor attachment but I pay the shipping on both the new part and the old broken one. $20. The whole thing brand new is $35 with free shipping on amazon. WTF!
1,Bad product and bad brand -don't buy it!!!!,I bought the blender and it suddenly stopped working after 8 times. I called Cuisinart who offered me a new one if I returned the old blender. I had to pay for the shipping & handling for both the new AND the old one. It ended up costing me half the price of the blender. DON'T BUY ANY OF THE CUISINART PRODUCTS AS THE WARANTY ONLY COVERS THE PRODUCT and nothing else!!!!! I'm so disappointed... I'll never buy any of their products again.
4,Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender Review,"Excellent! Ever since Braun discontinued their 200 watt hand blender in the U.S., our food research lab has been looking for something comparable. We evaluated 3 other immersion blenders before we finally found one that we felt was comparable, and it was this one. Very good quality, durability and is ergonomic."
1,Useless warranty should be against the law,"Ditto, ditto, ditto. What more can be said? What a disappointment in Cuisinart. You think you are buying a reputable brand but it stops working after 3 months and when you look at the warranty you find you have to pay more in shipping to get satisfaction than you paid for the product. This has definately put up a huge warning sign for me as regards purchasing ANY Cuisinart product. If you have the money to throw away go ahead and buy this product."
2,Minimal lifespan,"I have burned through two of these things with what I would consider pretty light use (bread crumbs, chopping nuts, pesto, vinagrette, etc.). The first one lasted for about a year, the second for about 4 months. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...It is handy and convenient when it works, but for the price and with the Cuisinart name, I expected something a little more sturdy."
1,"One piece of plastic, 143 bad reviews","Hello Cuisinart. I love my stick blender, I use it almost every morning for eggs. But this is my second one where the cheap plastic teeth on the motor have stripped in relatively short time. One cheap plastic piece on the motor which is metal on the attaching parts. Is this planned obsolescence? For $1, $5 you couldn't make this part out of metal? When all the other parts and accessories are so nice and well-made it's disappointing that you use this one cheapo piece that renders the product useless in a few months. Surely they have received enough complaints. I, too, was sent a new one after complaining. Few months of use, and the chopper stripped trying to chop water chestnuts...and then it was ruined for the blender."
4,good product,"I bought this for my son after I had already been using one myself for a couple of months. It makes chopping so much quicker, and is perfect for blending soups right in the pot."
4,Handy tool,"I think the tool is well made and looks good too. As for performance, it did a nice job to puree the butternut soup I made. I did have to start it and stop it many times because 30 seconds is a long time to keep it running. I hope to use it for many other recipes. Also, the attachments that come with it are useful. I am glad I have it and will use it often."
5,Absolutely Love it!!!,"Just recently purchased this when my husband broke our blender. I figured since it had the attachments, it would be a better purchase since it would be multi-functional. Used it for the first time on Thanksgiving and used every attachment it came with! Easy to move from one to the other and was very pleased with the funtionality of it! Easy to clean as well! Can't wait to use it more often!"
2,Twice bitten!,"I have owned two of these hand blenders and both were worthless after only a year. The first, I thought, was because I tried to chop raw carrots in the little chopper bowl. It made a funny sound and never worked again. However, the second one I used only for soft cooked vegetables and fruits (baby food!). Still, it became slower and slower and after only 13 months, it did not work at all. I called, I complained. I would have had to send it back at my cost, and then they would have determined whether or not to replace or refurbish mine. Since the second one met the same fate as the first, I was not really willing to go through this again in another year. I am looking around for a different brand."
5,GREAT ITEM FOR PRICE,I was very excited about getting this blender and was not disappointed. It is an excellent buy!I thought it might not be all that it was advertised but it was all that the ad said it would be. Very powerful little machine!
1,Junk,"Broke down after just 10 days. Motor spinning, but blade isn't. Returning it for a full refund. I am unable to detach the blending shaft now, so I can't even ship it back in its original box anymore. The Braun 4185 I used until I bought this one 10 days ago lasted for 10 *years*! Actually, that one still is going strong, but its blending shaft melted in the dishwasher 2 weeks ago. I am going to look for a replacement part instead."
4,Shakes and more!,"I got this from my BFF for xmas. It works great and i love how it has a chopper. I've only made milkshakes with this hand blender, but you can use it for so much more =) Excited to make some soup with this badboy."
3,Handy but has some problems,"I have had this Hand blender for 2 months. It replaced my Braun which I used for 15 years. I really like that the immersion blender portion detaches from the motor for easy clean up. I don't like that the immersion blender portion isn't water tight so if you put it in dirty dishwater for cleaning, it will fill up with dirty dishwater. It drains out with some shaking but still...yuck. Also the chopper has not worked well at all. According to customer service, you need to push down really hard on the stick (not so hard that you crack the top) but REALLY hard to get the blade to turn. I tried pushing really hard and could only get the blade to turn a little bit."
3,worked great for a year,"this blender is versatile and worked great for a year but after a year, (with avarage use)I have to hold the 2 pieces together to use it because the connection is so loose."
1,Absolute crap!,"I bought this blender because Cuisinart used to be synonymous with good quality but this product was anything but quality. To begin, the attachment chopper broke the VERY FIRST TIME I used it. I didn't return it because I was more interested in the blender part. I used it perhaps 6 times when the plastic teeth which form the gears which make the blade turn STRIPPED and MELTED. Seeing as how the blade is pretty key to say, BLENDING, this left me with a very pretty chrome hunk of rubbish. I would not only not recommend this product, I will now not buy any other Cuisinart product!"
1,awful product,"I bought it mostly to puree baby food. The first one I got worked fine for about a month, then the chopper stopped working. I thought it was bad luck and got another one, which never worked. I just took it out of the box and I'm speechless, the chopper simply does not work at all. Awful awful awful product!"
4,What can I say?,"I've always respected the Cuisinart brand name, and that's one of the major deciding factors that helped me choose this product. I wasn't disappointed. I love the brushed steel look, and especially the versatility. Very easy to clean, too. I've always been annoyed at how loud similar products have been but the motor is quite quiet, and unless I'm blending crushed ice it's a nice volume level during use.The only thing that bothers me is the blade in the chopping cup is a bit difficult to clean if anything is stuck on it, since it is so slick but the blades are so sharp, and the pulse button style is a little trigger-happy so I have a few more inadvertent spins when not in food, which just sprays my food a little bit when I slip. *that one is more my fault though!*"
1,"Save your money, this is poor quality","Save your money and invest in a better immersion blender.The teeth that connect to the different attachments are made of plastic - and they have worn off after only a few uses. None of the blades will spin now, regardless of which attachment you are using - rendering the blender completely useless."
1,Waste of money...,"I've had this blender maybe three months, I've barely used it and the inside plastic teeth are stripped and the chopper wont spin. What a peice of crap."
5,awesome!,"i bought this for a liquid diet i started. the best way to blend the shakes is in a blender- if you use a shaker there are still clumps in it.i bought this after a lot of searching and figured i'd get it because later on i could use the food processor attachment to make my own baby food with the next baby. i love this blender. it is easy to clean, i take it in a bag with me when we go on vacations (need to plug it in), and i keep in plugged in on my countertop. it is made very well. love the durability (stainless and black). it chops crushed ice awesome! do not try and chop ice that is in cubes or even small cubes, i did this once at a friends house (with store bought ice) and it didn't chop it well and i felt like i was going to distroy my blender. it didn't distroy it but i love this thing and don't want anything to happen to it. i depend on it. i can make really thick shakes or liquidy shakes. i can't say enough about it. it is by far one of the smartest purchases i have ever made!"
5,Love It!,"I have had this product for about 4.5 years now and have consistently used it a couple a times a week the entire time I have had it. I use the chopper attachment for garlic, onions, tomatoes, salsa and I use the hand blender for protein shakes. The hand blender crushes up ice cubes and frozen fruit without a problem. I love how easy it is to clean up!! My original unit came with a plastic cup, but that cracked a couple of years ago. I just blend up my drinks in a pyrex 2 cup measuring cup. The motor is just starting to go so I might soon by another to replace the one I have. Definitely worth the investment!!"
4,Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick w/ Whisk & Chopper,"Bought this for my husband, the family chef. I think I enjoy it as much as he does. Easy to use - easy to clean up - does what it purports to do. What else is there to say?"
1,I thought it was great but then it stopped working.,I used this immersion blender probably 10 times before it stopped working. I had the same problem that a lot of the other reviews stated. One day the blade stopped spinning properly. Upon closer inspection I realized the teeth were ground down rendering the device unable to spin the blade. Major waste of money.
4,Works Great! Great Price,"I purchased the Cusinart CSB-77 from Amazon and have used it half a dozen times so far to make smoothies. It works great! Easy to clean and I like being able to just put everything into a big glass and blend it up. The blender part pops off the motor part and cleans up easiily. No lock on run button so you have to keep the on button depressed to keep going, but I don't find I run it for a long shot at a time so it has not been a problem so far. I hope it holds up.October 2012 Update - still going strong 18 months later. Makes great smoothies and for quick chopping using the attachement. I recommend this to anyone who likes kitchen gizmos and likes to make a quick blend of anything."
4,I like it,"I like this hand blender alot, chopped nuts for a bread very easy. First time I tried it attempted to do mash potatoes it did not do very well, not enough milk/butter? had to mash a little first then did a fine job will have to experiment more to find out how to use."
1,Broken Mechanism,"This blender replaced a still working one from Braun that I had for over 10 years, and couldn't last 6 months. The blade stopped on a piece of frozen spinach and after closer inspection the linkage between the handle and the blade was stripped. Odd that they'd make it out of a tiny piece of plastic and not something beefier. Wish I read the reviews here before getting it, because apparently this is a common problem. This'll be my last Cuisinart product..."
1,Cuisinart Blender - quality problems,"We've bought 3 different blenders from Cuisinart during the last 3 years.All of them are not usable anymore. The motor is fine, but the mechanic is broken, so the blade is not rotating anymore.We have sent a lot of emails to the customer service, but that didn't help.We will never by a product from Cuisinart anymore, and we can just warn anyone to by a blender from this brand.From our experience a blender will last about a year or a bit longer."
2,design faliure,This product failed only after two months of light use.. The gears that connect the motor with the attachements has breaked down
1,Broken in 2 months,It was well first 2 months but after 2 months it was getting slower and one day it was suddenly broken. We did not use the product too much. The quality is not good
1,Don't waste your $,"We love having a hand mixer to blend soups. But the Cuisinart CBS-77 is not reliable. The motor body seems hefty but it mates to the blending shaft mate with plastic gears. And in our case the gears strip when making an icing for a gingerbread house. Cuisinart customer service was nice enough on the phone, but it's a hassle to fix something that should standup to kitchen duty."
1,Nothing that hasn't already been said...,"Just as many others have noted, the plastic gearwork in the blender body easily become stripped. My first one lasted for a while, but then the attachments stopped engaging and the blender became useless. I thought it had just outlived its lifespan and bought another one. The same thing happened to this one in just a few months. Cuisinart replaced it, but the replacement lasted only one use. I'm done with this model, and I'm done with this brand."
4,Good entry line hand blender,"This is replacing a Braun of equivalent specification, which lasted about two years (I had another identical Braun before that which lasted about 1.5 years). I hope this one will last more than 2 years. I use it for light work, since I am very well equipped for heavy work, with food processor, blender and stand mixer. I have been using this Cuisinart for less than a month, but I like it better than the Braun model I have been using. I like how the parts separate, so you can place them in the dish washer. All the components work well and are easy to clean manually (so I typically don't put them in the dishwasher).I will update this post when the thing dies, which hopefully will not happen before 2014..."
2,Lasted less than a year,"I bought this blender less than a year ago. It has seen infrequent and very light duty, as in chopping parsley. The bottom of the mixing cup already has 5 cracks in it.Ergonomics are poor. It's too large and poorly balanced.Compared to the Braun it replaced after over 10 years of using the Braun, this is a poor product. Unfortunately, as with just about everything in the USA, ""value"" is paramount and cheap is what we get."
3,Attachements are not good at all on this blender,"I have tried to use the chopper attachement several times and it SUCKS !!!!! I have tried carrots, onion, jalapenos, nuts and cheese and every time it gets stuck. I would not recommend the blender with attachments just stick with the blender itself."
1,Half a Machine,Received as a gift. The stainless steel blending blade works great. The Blender/Chopper is useless...and it's my second. Clerk at large national department store acknowledged over half the Smart Sticks they sell come back due to Blender/Chopper defects.
1,"Sad to say, it was a 5 start when I bought it, but...","I loved this immersion blender until it did what others have said: it ran slowly, sounded funny and no longer blended anything! I used mine 1-2 times daily for about 9 months before it bit the dust."
1,Low quality not worthy of the brand,"I bought this item without reading reviews first as I trusted the brand with their reputation of high quality products. It clearly was a mistake, it broke after 5 uses, as many other reviewers have complained. The motor itself is working great but the mechanism to attach the motor part to the chopper/stick/whip is made of cheap plastic that ends up over-heating and blending the 2 parts' plastic dents together. So now it won't connect to the part with blades, rendering it utterly useless. I'm not even going to bother sending it back to Cuisinart as I read that their customer service is pretty lame and what use would I have of a brand new product that is most likely going to fail quickly?My advice to curious shoppers: avoid the hassle, either get one of their bigger food processors with good reviews, or go for another brand for a stick blender."
4,whisk useless,"THe blender works great, as does the chopper attachment, BUt with only one speed the whisk throws everything out of the mixing bowl. It won't even work in the attached beaker."
4,Smart Stick is a smart buy,"I have just purchased my second Smart Stick -- the only issue is the plastic gear in the head that will break if the attachment isn't put on right. Don't try to force it. Otherwise it is one of the most useful tools in my kitchen. I thought I was getting a smoothie maker primarily but it turns out to be much better and quicker than my food processor or my mixer for light jobs. I even use it for cake mixes and haven't gotten the blender out since I've had my Smart Stick.Amazon, as usual, had the best buy I could find."
2,Works well for a (short) while,"I've had this blender for a little under two years. The mixing container stopped working about a year in, the measuring beaker has a large crack in it, and today the chopper stopped working. Probably not worth it unless you want to buy a new one in two years.On the plus side, it's very pretty."
5,Most useful kitchen gadget I own,"Seriously, I love this thing. So handy. Makes great smoothies, whipped cream, sauces, etc..... So much easier to use than a standard food processor or blender. Very easy to clean too, just throw everything in the dishwasher. Ive given two as gifts now, I love them that much!"
2,Great in theory,"Beautiful idea but chopper attachment didn't work at all when new. Called and was told to pursue complaint with seller (After having been told initially that item was ""out of warranty""(?)!) Recieved as gift so not much hope for satisfactory resolution I'm afraid..."
2,poor design deep in the unit,I had to change my review. The teeth that engage the unit are plastic and stripped out- effectively ruining the unit. Some bean counter decided to cheap out on the most important part- which has rendered the unit useless.
1,"Goes fast, BREAKS faster!","This is the second piece of junk that we've purchased from Cuisinart! While this one lasted longer than the other, neither products lasted more than 6 months, total! We purchased a food processor from them that gave up on us in less than 1 month, and while this one lasted a little bit longer, it too is now defective. Ok, you're probably wondering what are we chopping up with this thing, BRICKS?!? Oh, contrar, we use this to chop up my infant sons baby food, rather than purchase any of the suspect ready made stuff. The only reason that I gave them 1 star is because Amazon doesn't do fractions! I am satisfied that I will not buy anything EVER again with the name Cuisinart on it! To us, Cuisinart stands for stuff that you want to give to people that you really don't like. Because with normal usage, they will be buying a replacement in less than a year!"
1,"teeth STRIPPED off FOR SURE using the attachments, do NOT throw away yet...contact me..","DO NOT use the attachment on this model, the teeth on the main handle STRIPPED OFF FOR SURE, because the the length of 2 teeth male pole on the attachment is 3mm short, it can only rieach the mouth of the the handle female teeth hole, so all teeth will be stripped off. Once the teeth gone, everything turns into junk.Do NOT throw them away yet, I am going to china and ask someone there to make metal teeth kits so you can glue it to it.The people have given 4 or 5 stars comments are all lying! This model with attachment having huge design flaw!wait for my repairing kit, I will post it here when I come back."
1,JUNK,"The first three times I used the chopper to chop garlic, it went well. The fourth time, it wouldn't chop. A rip-off, at least as regards the chopper, and while the blender still works, I have doubts it will work much longer.I expect never to buy a Cuisinart product again. Kitchenaid for me."
4,Great for purees and smoothies,"I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews and to be fair, I've only owned this for a week or so. But so far, I love it! I use it primarily for making small batches of pureed vegetables (for recipes out of Jessica Seinfeld's ""Deceptively Delicious"") and it blends and purees so easily. I use the chopper attachment to turn the food into a mushy solid, then switch to the beaker/hand blender to finish it off as a puree. The best part is, cleaning is a snap - the blade pops right out of the chopper attachment, so you just clean each part separately (or toss them in the dishwasher) and you can use it again.Maybe a standard food processor would suit the people who've complained of it not holding up...because I think if for light blending/pureeing/mixing, this definitely gets the job done well. I will also say if you're in tight living quarters, it's great as this stores very easily - unlike a clunky food processor!"
2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed with the durability of this product. The bottom of the bowl of the chopper attachment cracked on the second use and the housing of the primary immersion chopper/blender attachment was separating on a recent use. I have only used my Cuisinart Smart Stick about 10 times. Clearly, this product was not built to normal Cuisinart standards. I have the tradidtional food processor, a Cuisinart coffee maker and a toaster -- love them all, so I was excited about the Smart Stick. It's really not so Smart."
1,Very disappointing,"I had a Braun hand blender with attachments for many years and expected the Cuisenart to match, if not exceed, its quality. However, I've been very disappointed. It did not chop things evenly at all, necessitating taking out bigger pieces for hand chopping. Then it failed to blend and when I checked to see if food was stuck in the blades, I found it wasn't turning at all. I was trying to blend fairly soft food. The final straw came when I tried to use the whisk and I could barely get it to turn at all. After suffering with this for many months, I'm getting rid of it. I wish Braun still made their very superior product."
5,good buy!,"Bought this a month ago and have been using it ever since. It's easy to use and easy to clean, I'm loving it! Definitely a good buy."
1,Not Happy,"Doesn't hold a charge well, couldn't turn my ice cream into soft serve even. Not pleased at all with this item, don't even think I will attempt and onion or nuts, with the chopper. Absolutely no power at all."
2,SmartStick Fails after one-year,"I got a SmartStick as a gift and used it about 15 times in one year. Now neither the blend shaft or chopper lid make a connection with the motor shaft. It just stripes the gears and smells like it is burning. This also happend with my Cuisinart Blender. When all the units worked it was great and I would have recommended them, but it seems as if the longevity of these units is short lived. Hopefully, I just got 2 bad products, but what are the chances of that?"
3,"Wonderful gadget, but wears out quickly","What a useful and versatile tool this SmartStick is! Unfortunately it has 2 major downsides:1 - It wears out quickly. After a while the main stick containing the engine wears out and no longer has proper grip on the attachments;2 - No additional attachments available, such as a dough hook.I still gave it 3 stars as it's so pretty and so versatile, but just don't use it too often."
2,Cuisinart CSB,"Good afternoon, I would like to inform me how long has the device durability since it was bought for me, just two months and no longer works. I thought it was good value because I have many products of this brand and first time I have problem with one.Thank you for your attention and prompt response to my concernUndo edits"
4,Former Chef who loves this,"I used to be a chef and love using this in the kitchen. I like the versatility of the ""Magic Wand""."
4,"great mixer, but the other attachments...","The blender is great. The other attachments required experimentation. The whisk is really messy and the chopper does a bit more than chop, but is great for quick fresh salsa."
5,Love It,"I love the blender and use it all the time to puree cooked vegetables, mix scrambled eggs. I haven't used the chopper or the whisk but will soon. Well worth the price."
4,works well.....,"good quality and works as described. i would recommend it, and it has quite a few uses. the price was right and the unit seems very well made."
2,"I WANT to like it, but.............",it came without the stick blender & beaker.....need to return or have the rest shipped to me. Very Sorry. :>(
1,"Good product, but bad build quality","Great product while it worked, but as stated by others, the teeth that connect the motorized unit to the chopping/whisking units are made out of plastic. After a few used, the teeth were stripped and rendered the entire set useless."
1,A Disposable Gadget,"A little more than a year ago I purchased a SmartStick Hand Blender (CSB-77). I was very unsatisfied with this product from the start because the mixing bowl attachment didn't work. The whisk attachment was redundant.The only useful feature - the reason I bought it in the product in the first place - to puree soups with the blending shaft - stopped working few months ago.In other words, I got barely a year of poor service from this product.The SmartStick is now laying useless on my kitchen counter waiting to be thrown away, which I am loathe to do as I firmly believe that appliances should last longer than 12 months; should not be disposable. Especially since I carefully followed the care, cleaning, and assembly instructions.I'm inclined to avoid all Cuisinart products from now on."
2,Very dissapointing,"Out of the box the attachments did not work, but we kept it as I only really wanted the emmersion blender for soups. This worked reasonably well for a few months - and then stopped. As others noted, the warranty is rediculous."
1,Broke catastrophically in less than one year,"I could not find my receipt so the three year guarantee did not work for me. The chopper went first, then the hand blender. The whisk still works, but that is not enough for me. I might keep the whisk and go with a simpler less expensive hand blender. Don't let the stainless steel fool you. It is just for show. All the connecting parts are plastic and wear away fast if you use this for anything substantial.I had my braun for ever - 10 - 15 years or more? It was great.Also, there seems to be another basic design issue as this hand blender kicked up soup more than my very old, original hand blender.I rethought my rating after I wanted to blend some soup yesterday and had no hand blender. Where is my old braun..."
1,broken,"i love cuisinart, usually. the blade to the blender stick does not rotate after 1 year of use and the chopper attachment i think worked ONCE, maybe. do not buy this!"
4,Does what I need it too,"So far I've used this to puree soup in the pot, chop nuts very fine and chop onions. It did all of the above very nicely and with no problems. The ability to blend my pureed soups right in the pot on the stove is a wonderful thing. So far no complaints."
1,If you don't want to waste your hard earned money don't buy this,The blender stopped working after 6 months of minimal use. Avoid it. I wish I had read the 1 star reviews before buying it!
1,the worst ever !!,it just workd for a couple month then it stopped ....although I did not use it that much..I really dont recommend it just a waste of money .
4,Can't live without it,"I love this thing, it is indispensable in my cooking. However do not expect it to last more than 3 years. - still worth it."
5,Best new gadget of the past year,"I cook a great deal and have a very well-equipped kitchen. For some reason I did not have a hand held immersion blender. After struggling with hot soup in the food processor, I finally asked for this for Valentine's Day. I love it and have been making pureed soups and sauces every weekend as a result. Also, the little mini processor is handy when you have a small amout to chop. Easy to use and clean, LOVE this gagdet. It is attractive, sturdy and a good deal. Just bought it as a birthday gift for a friend."
1,stopped working,It is hard to attach to motor to the accessories. Stopped working 3 months after receiving. Chopper would not do nuts.
3,Cleaning problem,I should have read the details more carefully before buying. I'm sure it works fine but the lid of the little food chopper attachment can only be cleaned with a damp cloth or sponge. The inside of this lid is going to get food particles on it when used. There is a groove around the mechanism that spins the blade where food can get lodged. I don't think wiping it with a damp colth would be enough to keep this clean. I have a similar wand attachment that has a lid you can submerge in water but it is wearing out and I wanted a replacement. But this isn't it.
3,It's Okay,"Was really happy when we first got this. It worked great. But I guess because it has plastic parts, it just wore out so quick. The chopper doesn't work and now the blender attachment doesn't work. The last time I used the immersion blender, you could smell it burning (yikes!) -It's been less than three years. Definitely thought it would last longer. -I guess if you want something high quality, you have to pay for it. -But if you don't use this product that often, and you don't want to spend lots of money, it's a good product. -Would I buy it again, not if I knew it was going to bust before 3 years. -I'm going to look for something that's made with better construction and am willing to pay the extra $$ for it."
1,garbage,used it 4 times and the chopper grinder attachment would not turn THEN the blade attachment stopped working just a few uses. never ever again. I did did not abuse it in anyway. I followed directions as printed only soft foods were used
3,Excellent whisk attachment,This is a good little blender for quick small jobs. The whisk attachment is especially helpful. It is a little bit heavy so if your hands tire easily it may not be for you.
4,what a great tool,I don't know how I could have managed my kitchen without it. I bought one for each of my 3 daughters. We all think it is the Bomb! We keep it close at hand because we use it so often. It's small and you can store it in a drawer if you like. It does everything it says it does...we love it. I would recommend it to any kitchen person.
1,"Junk, barely worked for 6 month","Nice made from outside, extremely cheap plastic connector between the actual unit and attachments which crashed after 6 month. Now I have another dead cuisinart ""product"" in my collection so don't waist your money on it and if you do, prepare to pay for shipping for of item to cuisinart and back. This is how their ""warranty"" works."
1,Poor quality Hand Blender,"Initially I was quite excited about this product, as it is quite handy and useful for a variety of tasks. Unfortunately it has not lasted. The chopper I only used once on onions and then blade stopped rotating. I spent $10-15 for the replacement part, but unfortunately the replacement was no better. I ended up having to buy a black and decker chopper which has been great. The cusiniart motor works fine, but the rotating teeth are made of plastic and erode easily so it loses the rotary component. The same thing has now happened with the soup blender/smart stick - which I have been able to use a handful of times, but those days are over as well because the blade will not spin. It seems that other people have been happy with this product, maybe I got a faulty batch, but I am quite hesitant to buy cusiniart products now because of this unfortunate experience. They don't make things that last."
3,Liked it a lot while it worked,"My didn't wear out as quickly as some of the one star reviews, but my chopper did wear out after about 4 years of moderate use. Not sure if that's par for the course? It wasn't that expensive to begin with. The Immersion blender part still works fine."
1,"Sorry product, unworthy of the brand.","I have purchased other Cuisinart products before. However, this hand blender is an unmitigated disaster. Neither my wife nor I can use it! It takes superhuman strenght just to separate the different parts for the clean up.Sorry product, unworthy of the brand."
1,Great kitchen tool until it breaks!,I bought the csb-77 about 3 years ago. The hand blender is great to use and easy to clean. The steel finish is very classy. We used it only few times before the chopper grinder attachment quits working about a year ago. Last week the blending shaft stopped working as well which was the end of my investment. The problem seems to be in the drive mechanism as it is manufactured from plastic. The teeth that connects the shaft of the blender to the motor breaks after several uses causing the blades to stop rotating. It is a flaw in the design. I would not recommend it for any one before cuisinart fixes it's design.
1,Broke down after light use,"First, the plastic on the chopper bowl lid broke while I was trying to grate cheese (according to the directions). And then, after I replaced it (it took them 2 tries to ship out the correct part), something in the motor stopped working so that none of the attachments rotate at all (the motor is on though). This was a gift so I don't have a receipt. Cuisinart will not replace the motor under the warranty. Looking for a different brand now. It looks like it'll be sturdy, but it is not!"
4,I've changed my mind about this blender...,"My original review was very negative, but I have come to really enjoy the Cuisinart Stick Hand Blender. One of the nicest things about it is the mini-processor, which works well to make small portions and eliminates getting out the Big Cuisinart (with all that the cleanup of that entails). All of my initial concerns have subsided -- I still do think that Cuisinart should have paid the shipping for the replacement part, but now that this is safely in the past, I am enjoying using this appliance. It literally saved the day when I was making ""Fleming's Potatoes"" and neglected to process the leeks before putting into the cream sauce with the cheese. A few zaps with the blender and all was well."
1,Ditto for piece of junk - Shame on Cuisinart for not correcting this!,"Like many others, the teeth on my unit were stripped very quickly.Cuisinart service said they needed a receipt from years ago to do the replacement. Jamie, the service rep agreed it was rediculous to expect anyone to keep such receipts but still refused to provide a replacement.Shame on them for making a bad situation worse by not correcting a fatal design flaw.This will negatively affect my view of the entire brand and should negatively affect yours too."
1,Junk,"I read reviews complaining that the plastic ""teeth"" to this blender wears down, rendering the whole thing useless. Well, even with the caveat, I purchased the item and sure enough -- few months later, the teeth wore down and I had to trash the blender and the chopper attachment. I wasn't happy with the blender even before -- it doesn't blend food at the bottom of the cup and the chopper attachment doesn't properly ""grip"" and chop the food -- but the plastic teeth thing is really ridiculous. An important component that attaches the motor to the blade should really be made better. This is a shoddy piece of equipment and I warn others to stay away. Cuisinart really needs better quality control and should be ashamed."
1,versatile but poorly designed drive splines,"I have used this product for making smoothies, chopping fruits, making meringue, and many other things. The original one I purchased failed within the first month. The splines connecting the motor to the attachment stripped, there is insufficient engagement between splines of attachments to the motor. I returned it and got another one. After several months (and being very careful with it) this one has failed also. I'm going with another brand and would not recommend Cuisinart to anyone looking or a hand blender."
2,Disappointing...,"When it worked it was a lifesaver. A great product that deserves its place in every kitchen. But after 6 months of regular use, the motor just died on us. We hadn't used it much for the first 6 months and by the time it died, it was past a year of use. So touch luck.I am not going to recommend a different product saying its better. I believe these products to have a limited shelf life and thus spending $50 on it instead of $20-$30 on inferior brands would really be no different. Atleast for the cost of one Cuisinart device, you can go through two of the other brands."
5,Great product,"Very handy and useful. I have an older model, the new one is a big improvement. Good price, fast service."
5,great product,Affordable well made design. Use it just about every day. I have definitely got my moneys' worth fron this purchase.
1,Broke on the second use.,"This product stinks. It broke the second time I used it. The engineering on this hand blender is awful. The motor shaft is connected to a small piece of plastic that quickly (on the second use) stripped. This piece of plastic is used to spin the blades. Don't waste your time.amazon.com accepted the return and all is well. Instead, I bought a Ninja blender. Although it's not a hand blender, the Ninja worked beautifully."
2,Bad service for Cuisinart,"Unable to contact seller to check for product voltage support after many exempts. I Contact Amazon and they advise me to use a voltage converter. I check with them if a travel adapter can be use? They say is able to use it. So I plug in the travel adapter and power on it, the fuse blow when I push the button on the Cuisinart CSB-77 Smart Stick Hand Blender. I contact Amazon again, and they say will pay for the voltage converter I buy and refund 20% of the product price. The first time I buy from Amazon and they service is very good. They really care for thier customers. I do not thick this type of service can be found in my country. Thank you Amazon"
2,Not exactly,"While it works very well, its not exactly what I was hoping for. It blends things at such a fast speed that batter (or whatever) goes flying. It really does need variable speed. With no way to slow it down you have to have a lid on whatever your mixing. Consequently, I don't use it much."
1,don't waste your money,"I purchased this based on name brand,and Cuisinart is usually associated with quality. I spent over twice as much as I did on my last immersion blender (Braun) and it has half the power, only one power setting (The Braun has like 10)The Chopper doesn't even work, the power handle doesn't seat properly on the top of it, and I am so unhappy with it. Would never recommend this product."
1,bad quality,"I have bought and returned two of these in the past 8 months or so. The chopper barely worked from the start every time, and the whisk was pretty feeble and inconvenient to use, but I put up with those because the hand blender part was useful... the short time it lasted. The plastic teeth in the mechanism that makes it rotate get burned or deformed in some way, and it stops spinning all of a sudden. This can take a few weeks or months (I used mine quite a lot), but is definitely not worth it for the price (especially with the completely useless chopper and whisk attachments). I gave it 2 chances, and ended up returning it both times (to BB&B), so I am definitely not buying it again and would NOT recommend it to anyone."
1,Breaks after 4 months,"Don't buy this. If you do, save your receipt--I'm glad I did. I loved this product for the first four months. And, just like the other 1-star reviews, it quit working. The motor runs fine, but the teeth get stripped, and none of the attachments will rotate. I didn't deal with Cuisinart, because the store I purchase it at took it back."
5,We love this,I'm really surprised to see the negative reviews. We use the blender several times a day and the chopper several times a week. We love it. We've had several other immersion blenders and mini choppers and this one out-performs all of them. I have absolutely no complaints about it.
1,Awefull Product!,It has only one speed setting which is horrible and causes a mess every time I try to use it. The whisk is poorly designed and the chopper is too small to chop properly. The immersion blender is ok but there are better products out there that you can buy that are more value for your money. DO NOT BUY!!
2,Yep - mine broke too after a while,"Like everyone else, I loved this at first and the handheld still works well but the chopper broke and just makes this horrible grinding sound when I try to run it. Disappointed b/c I'm too cheap to buy a $150 processor and plus this one is so small and easy to clean. It was super convenient until it broke. Now I can't even make a freaking pesto. :("
1,Disappointing,"This hand mixer has a lot of power, but only one speed...super fast! About the only thing I found it good for was whipping cream - and I had to be really careful or it would splatter everywhere. The food processor part of it is awful, mainly because it only has one speed and beats everything up to mush. The image they show of the product with large pieces of veggies in it have been cut with a knife and placed in the container, it does not cut anything in large pieces. I stupidly tried to mash potatoes in this and they came out the consistency of glue (as did every other vegetable I tried). I do not recommend."
5,Too warm? (It's great!),"I woke up sweating on a cold night and had to take the liner out of my sleeping bag so I could get back to sleep! Extra insurance against the cold in a small size that is easy to pack and not expensive to purchase, there is no reason not to pick this up to help you stay safe and comfortable."
3,Coleman sleeping bag liner,This item added and extra 10 degrees to my sons' sleeping bags w/o a great addition of weight. They have also slept w/ just the liner and been plenty warm.It is a good addition to your back packing and camping supplies.The item fits easily into the compression sack and packs small.
3,"NOT bad, but but not great.","This came in red fabric, as shown, but with a HUGE tag in the bottom middle. I attempted to removes the very stiff tag, and it ripped out 4 inches of stitching. So it was more useful as a light blanket. Yes, i could restitch it, but I'm not bothering. If someone needs it, they'll have to do the sewing themselves."
2,"ok for a liner, not recommended otherwise","I bought 4 of these bags thinking they would work well for camping when the evening temps droped to 50. Everybody in the family complained of being cold! I used mine as cover instead of a bag, the double thickness made it warm enough.In all fairness I have used it as liner quite sucessfully. I put it in a 20 degree bag in tempts of slightly less than 20. Slept on ice pack with a Thermarest pad and was surprisingly comfortable. It did feel nice to the touch.I really can't recomend this for anything other than sleep overs or a heated caabin type of camping. Using as a liner is barely acceptable, it adds alot of unnecessary bulk, your better off getting a bag thats rated a little lower than expected."
4,"good, but feels a bit cheap","I like this thing, originally comes with a strong plastic smell. I ripped out the large white instruction tag on the bottom with the washing instructions and it ripped the threading between the fleece part and the zipper lining. A bit disappointing, you would think they would plan on people ripping that off. You can feel the zipper and it is bit uncomfortable when you are sleeping.I knew I would get a random color, and I ended up with a kind of pea soup green, kind of ugly, I wish it was darker. Packs down to the size of about a football."
4,Keeps you warm!,I got this for a training camp out... I put it on top of the mattress in the open air cabin and then put my sleeping bag on top vs using it as a liner.. This worked to keep the cold mattress from making my sleeping bag cold. I slept nice and toasty all night long. I will be using it again this weekend but will probably try it inside the bag this time around as I will be tent camping and not in a cabin. Definitely worth the money for added warmth and comfort.
4,It actually works!,"I don't usually buy from Coleman, but decided to try this product out. IT WORKS PERFECTLY but only as a liner. I would not recommend this as a sleeping bag, but as I said, it is only a good liner. I can't say too much else except- buy this as a liner to a good sleeping bag and you will not be disappointed."
4,"Your basic fleece sleeping bag/bag liner--nothing more, nothing less","I bought this to use as a liner because I was borrowing my friend's sleeping bag for a fall camping trip. I found it adequate and as expected. It's fairly compact and comes in a cheap quality stuff sack. The fleece is soft and the zipper worked fine. It does say to wash in a commercial washer (as I read in a comment), but it's small enough to fit in my regular sized one. I believe that's probably something that is standard on sleeping bag tags. All in all, I'd buy it again."
3,It stinks out of the package,"My main con is that it really stinks, even wasching it in a bathtube over night (I don't have a frontloader, which is for most sleeping bags, even this one, recommended) with sport wasching detergent didn't remove the smell completely.It has a sqare shape from top to bottom, without an additional head section like in a regular sleeping bag. So if you open it it is like a regulare thin fleece blanket with a bold zipper on it.Overall it will do better than just a blanket in my sleeping bag, because it is (nearly) closed on all sides (there is a not closed area at the bottom from about 2 inches before the zipper starts)."
4,Kenny Rogers and The First Edition are the best!,"I really love the show Rollin' and wish a complete dvd set of the series would come out. In the meantime though this tape contains 2 poorly edited copies of original episodes it is worth seeing. Ike and Tina are great. The version of Proud Mary here is one of their best. Gladys Knight and Kin Vassey's duet is terrific. Kenny himself has stated he didn't know why Kin didn't become a solo success as well. He had a stong bluesy voice that has been missed since his mid 90s death. Kenny's best moment is There's An Old Man In Our Town. Many will be surprised to see his ""hippie"" look but I for one think he looks really cool. Even more iumpressive is the smooth tibre of his voice, something that was lost as he entered his 40s. Terry Williams get's to do a little comedy and the whole band shines on an accustic jam of Hey Bo Diddley. All in all worthwhile though sloppy in execution. The company didn't even bother with the correct song titles on the back."
3,Not great for gas burners,"This could be a great product, but if you have a gas stove, there are some major problems. On our stove when on high heat, the flames come up the side of the pan and burn the plastic handle, giving off a terrible burnt plastic smell. The smell doesn't get into the food (since the pan is closed) but it does smell up the house for a day, not to mention that the plastic handles probably will not last too many more occasions of this. I do try never, when using this pan, to turn up the heat, but sometimes I forget and the same thing happens.The pan would be much better if it had metal handles (but then they'd be hot to the touch)."
2,"""Small Additions"" would be a better title","Very few of the spaces shown incorporate the entire area the owners live in. Instead, some of these ""small"" spaces are 500-square-foot additions to much larger homes. It's not much of a challenge to make that work!This is a hodge-podge of designs with little theme, and Kodis' writing is some of the clunkiest in the home design field. Try any Taunton book, instead, such as one of the books in Sarah Susanka's excellent Not-So-Big House series."
5,VERY INSPIRATIONAL!,"This is a ""must have"" book for anyone who needs some inspiration and incentive for turning small spaces into fantastic living areas! Wow! Kodis's book offers a thorough look at creative and aesthetic solutions for all lifestyles. Complete with architectural renderings, floor plans, photographs, and excellent descriptions; the book appeals to a wide variety of tastes.Although Blueprint Small is an effective tool for getting started on projects, it's also darn good coffee table reading! I've given it to several friends as a gift, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. It's a wonderful combination of entertainment and utility.Kodis has a very clear and charming writing style that takes you eagerly from one chapter to the next . . . and has you wishing for more! She is professional and knowledgeable, but you don't have to be an architect to understand the book's content. It is truly a pleasure to read.I highly, HIGHLY recommend it!"
1,disappointed,"1.0 out of 5 stars disappointed, December 12, 2008The cover inspired me, I thought it was about ""creative ways to live with less"" (or what I understand by that: simplicity, autonomy,creative lifestyles...).I didn't expect to bump into this kind of projects: very much made from architect plans, quite out of touch with the environment, square, angulous, steel, glass, almost nothing about renewable energies and green materials.I loved Building Green by Clarke Snell, which develops a whole reflection on the impact of building, why make it small, how to make it beautiful and healthy. I guess I was looking for a book showing diferent projects in that line, example of people choosing to live happier with less, rather than somehow very conventional small houses, seen from the point of view of architects. I give the book away if you're interested!"
4,good second effort,"this is garden of elks second release and was released 27 years later. this is far more rock-oriented than thier first cd. though it is heavier on the electric guitar, some of the later tracks still carry some traditional instruments such as the violin. personally, i like their first release better. to me it was more organic in it's sound. this still is a good release for all you prog collectors."
4,Became Twice A Man,"Indeed, this group once had as amember Dan Söderquist who would go on to be a member of Cposmic Overdose and Twice A Man. This makes him an incredible pioneer in the realm of electronic music: Indeed from the space-hippy music of Aelgarnas to the lush electronica of Twice A man (still active) through the space-punk of Cosmic Overdose (his best band) his career has been one incredible ride."
4,Nice Package,"This phone has just about everything available on a wireless handset: calendar, camera (still and video), TV, games, ringtones, internet, PC sync and changeable faceplates. I've owned this phone for about 2 months and still enjoy it. I definitely believe that the phone should come with an extended battery as part of the package."
1,Usefull only two weeks,"Purchased this item and it lasted all of two weeks before our satellite radio once again did not work due to lack of power. Hmmm....two weeks? C'mon. We checked our outlets, receiver, etc. before realizing it was the cord. To return this useless item would cost more than I paid for it, plus the postage to receive it. Finding a power cord for our xm satellite receiver was quite a callenge. Well at least it was better than paying for the entire kit just to get a cord. How disappointing that a power cord has such a short life."
4,Worked!,Helping a friend and this worked fine with her old XM Roady that she wanted to convert to home use. She is very pleased with this adapter.
1,SK 89300 12 Piece Wrench Set,"SK 89300 12 Piece 8 Millmeter to 19 millimeter spline GPro racheting wrench set not made in USA. Made in TawainSpoke to a person in SK corporation today. Katie at custormer svc saids their GPro series wrenches and some of their air tools are made in Taiwan. 708-485-4574 SK will not refund the money I spend; however, going to disclose in SK website that GPRO series wrenches are made in Taiwin. 9/10/2007"
1,"VISTA, UGH!","I suspect that Vista blocked it, but I can't prove that. I really wanted to play this game. It sounds and looks interesting. Too sad, too bad. The vender was great and offered to give back my money. The problem with this gme is that it was written for DX-6. I have DX-10. There is a patch to bring it up to DX8, but it wouldn't work. No message boards were of any help and parent company is no more. Good luck."
4,Two B-Movie Gems from the MGM Vault!,"MGM's been releasing these Midnite Movies double-features for awhile now, and we've seen some true goldens, along with some absolute slop.This new double-bill falls into the goldens, though you wouldn't think so to read the titles.The two of these films both intertwine the genres of monster-horror and noir-mystery, creating sometimes silly but always entertaining funhouse rides that you'll want to watch several times."
1,WAS THIS HORROR?,I ENJOYED THE GORILLA AT LARGE. I CAN'T SAY IT WAS REALLY HORROR. MORE OF A THRILLER DRAMA. PICTURE QUALITY WAS GOOD AND SO WAS SOUND.THE OTHER MOVIE WAS STUPID.I DID NOT EVEN WATCH IT ALL. IBOUGHT BECOUSE OF PETER CUSHING. HE WAS ONLY IN IT FOR A MINUTE. SO I CAN NOT RECOMEND THIS ONE.
4,Good Reading,"I found myself enthralled with the characters and what they were going through. Very realistic. Not too mushy. Problems people deal with in the real world, which is why I think it is easy to relate and become engrossed."
3,Not her best work,"I, too, have read Ms. Mapson's other books, and have enjoyed them. I did feel, however, that ""Blue Rodeo"" was just a tad bit overblown and the ending was...how shall I put it? Well, just let me say that when I read the last page I thought to myself, 'That's the end?' It just wasn't a very strong ending. I did appreciate the the information about the Navajo culture and I yearn to visit Arizona and New Mexico after reading Ms. Mapson's books, but I just didn't enjoy this one as much as her others. I do hope that she writes more though!"
2,Disappointing,"When purchasing this book, I expected to read about rodeo and native american life with a little romance. I did learn a lot of the native american way of life and enjoyed reading about it. The romance story line was decent, but not incredible. The only mention of rodeo was towards the end. When the author misinformed the readers and wrote that the flankstrap used in the roughstock events is tied around the animals testicles. This is untrue. The fact is that the strap is used as a conditioning tool and does not harm the animal at all. In fact, some of the animals used in saddle bronc and bareback (which are horse events)are female not male. The author needed to get her facts straight or left rodeo out of the book completely."
3,Not really the kit.,"This is not the kit as on other sites with included targets, sights, pellets etc. this is just the rifle with a single shot and 5 round clip. The rifle itself is a mixed review. The stock and feel of the rifle is nice. Accuracy hard to assess with standard sights. Ok for plinking only. No problem hitting a tin can at 20 yards, but not precise. The issues are the cocking arm is flimsy and binds on cocking. Effort might be too much for youngsters. The 5 round clip is soft rubber , it also binds and doesn't always index and pellets fall out and jam action. Also the bolt would not close once. The same rifle is available elsewhere as a kit. A plus is the quietness. It is the quietest air rifle I have out of several springers, a CO2, and another pump up. Also there is no recoil like a springer so it is good for practice shooting.Update, the company contacted me. The listing is not their error, they are aware of the problem."
2,not happy,"this seller sold me a gun that was in very poor condition/ the inner frame was bent and the gun would not cock/ the seller gave me no satisfaction and really didn't care what i said and offered nothing to rectify the situation/ the seller basically called me a liar/however, with the avanti top of the line sights i purchased somewhere else (thank god) this rifle shoots omg accurate/shoots where you aim it good/4 the money a great rifle that my daughter will be able to shoot 4 many years (i hope)to come"
2,all this info is easy to find online,"This book would be quite useful to keep track of Dylan shows and setlists if..... the internet didn't exist! Within 5 minutes anyone can find the setlist to any Dylan show, ever! why do we need a book.Instead of Buying this book try and find a Dylan boot isn't just a restatement of what we can find out anyway!"
2,i heard a book a-comin' this way,"its one thing to stand on your head and say bob dylan read this book.....to say bob dylan reads bob dylan books. whats worse to is to accuse bob dylan of being a dylanologist----a dylanologist employed in the business of being bob dylan............i cant make out the sentences too good but the book is better read aloud in my mind, from a platform or atop an elephant on a parade. otherwise we are left in trap of dates here and there moving from past to present and onward. nowhere on this book can i find the date in nagadoches, in a beer and pretezel bar, a luminous gig, of course-----someone resembling and claiming to be kris kristofferson had to be taken into custody for attemting to play a mexican trumpet onstage, all the while bob dylan was said to have escaped throught he back door jumping on a horse and riding into town, selling his guitar at a rundown pawn shop. i give the book two stars for the two stars in my eyes."
5,Quality!!,This is made in the USA! And it's a great deal. They all grab the taps firmly & they don't slip out! Not like the cheepo chinky ones. They are also made like impact sockets so they can take a beating!! I would recomend these to anyone who does alot of tapping. They make anyone look like a pro.
3,some of these sockets don't fit rachets.,some of these sockets don't fit rachets. taps fit in them ok. and of course the ones that don't fit are the most common ones. i saw no info on how to get them exchanged with shipment. good deal bad product.
5,Fast and Factual,"As a practicing pediatrician, I use this book to review a few items that I have long since forgotten. I also recommend it to the medical students and pediatric residents that rotate through my office. I love the fact that the material is written in an easy to understand format. It virtually jumps off the page at you. I also think its organization into to etiology, epidemiology, differential diagnosis etc. makes it idea for the medical student. Its format reflects how you will be ""pimped"" on rounds and the key stats and concepts that you will see on the USMLE. A great read!!!"
5,Student,"I bought this book after my third year clerkship. I do wish I had it during the clerkship. Still, it has been great for Step 2 studying. I look things up very quickly and get a full picture of diseases I have a question about. The format is excellent."
4,Impressive amount of info.,"This book offers an impressive amount of info in just 2 pages per syndrome/disease. Love it for boards & reading up on topics you'll find on the office, however it lacks some acute issues you may find in the hospital. For instance, Electrolyte imbalances...a book like Inpatient Pediatrics sheds a great deal of light on that subject, but the book itself is physically larger."
5,Much better then a TV/VCR combo,i just bought a RCA TV/DVD combo after my VCR/TV combo mess up on me. I heard that TV/DVD combos never mess up. I love this box it shows great color and good surround sounds. It took me a while to get use-to everything like how to do my settings. I had to turn it on DVD mode but not have a DVD in it just to go to TV Display to set how I want my DVDs to show which in fullscreen not widescreen. This TV can get confusion sometimes cause theirs too much you have to do in order to hear both speakers play you have to set it that way.
4,Mario Winans- Good Job,"This is a good album. I think Mario did a great job as did all the musicians surrounding him. The songs are all pretty good. I especially like ""I Don't Wann Know"", ""3 Days Ago"", and ""Pretty Girl BS"". It may not be the newest innovation within the music world, but it is a great album. 4 stars."
5,The First and Truly Definitive Biography of Robert Greenleaf,"This book is a labor of love and will likely stand for a very long time as the definitive biography of Robert Greenleaf. The author had access to Greenleaf's family and private papers. You will learn how and why Greenleaf was able to develop his ideas about leadership and their vital connection to altruistic service, stewardship and a higher standard of ethics in our world today. Frick relates how he grew up, what his family life was like, what his career in corporate America was like and how his unusual 'second career' as a writer and consultant shaped his thinking. If you wish to understand servant leadership, Greenleaf's gift to humanity, and perhaps our only true hope of finding the leaders we need to create a better planet, then you need to read this book. FIVE STARS EASILY!"
1,"Pretty, but not effective",The case looks nice but the hardware inside is flimsy and does not hold keys [esp heavier ones].
2,Waste of money,Wallet was nice quality but the hooks were extremely difficult to open. My wife and I were only able to successfully 2 out of 6 hooks (even with pliers). Waste of time and money.
4,Leather Key Chain Holder,"I am very happy with this product. It is a Christmas gift for my grandpa, so I think he will really like it. Even though the color was a little darker than I expected, everything else was nice. I like that it has the pockets and even key chains for his keys. I think if you buy this product, you will be happy with it as well."
4,Great men's gift,Love the soft texture of the leather. Also like the added zipper compartment. Wonderful for those who own a business.
1,it is broken when I received it,The zip pocket is broken when I received it. It even use paper board in the wallet as structures. The leather is very thin and not sustainable.
2,Key Case,Very difficult to put keys in it. If you pay me to write your reviews I might comply!! I have said all I have to sday!
4,Great value for the money.,Works well and holds a lot of keys which is what I purchased it for. A little difficult putting keys on butthats good because they wont easily come off.
4,Functional and sturdy,"I got the burgundy case, which in person is a little more burgundy and little less brown than the product picture displays on my screen (that's fine). The clasps all work just fine and it holds all of my keys without a problem, even when I have two on one clasp. I did find one of the clasps difficult to get open, probably from my fingers wearing out from the previous clasps, but I did get it open and my keys on there. All in all it's a great deal for the price."
4,Great!,I bought this wallet for my mother-in-law. She was thrilled and happy to get it because she could not find this type of product in her vicinity. Thanks for having this product available.
3,It's more like a wallet that holds keys,"I thought when I purchased this item it was a standard old small key wallet. It turns out that when I got it it was about the same size as my wallet, and even had a separate partition to hold currency. Aside from that it's a very reliable product that is decently constructed"
4,how to get the keyson easily,"Easy way to get thpse keys on-put rubber bands on your thumb and first finger, or use those rubber finger holders they use to count bills in the banks, or rubber gloves for traction. It works fast."
5,Very good for the price,I was not very sure about this piece - just bought it as it was quite inexpensive.Turned out to be very good stuff.
2,Far below my expectations.,This key case was very disappointing. Other similar key cases I have owned were much better in design. The removable car key fob was not secure and would come apart easily. The whole case was too bulky.
2,Key Chain Holder Disappointing,"I was looking forward to getting a quality key chain and got something that leaves a lot to be desired. While the product looks nice, it is not well manufactured. The key hooks would not unlatch to allow me to attach keys, so I had my husband try to open them with pliers. This finally worked except that one of the hooks will no longer latch and is unusable. I am very disappointed. I guess the reason the price was so low was because the seller is trying to unload this product on those of us who buy it without actually seeing it."
5,Excellent Product,After searching every store in three large towns I decided to check Amazon for the Key Wallet. I found what I was seeking and ordered two. Both were delivered within a week and both exceeded my expectations. I find they are very functional and will hold all but the largest of keys.
1,Horrible.,"This has got to be one of the worst items I have ever purchased. Terrible quality, terrible design, no use."
4,AWESOME SINGER!!!,"Wow this is an awesome Cd, i could listen to all the songs over and over!!!! Keshia Chante is an awseome singer and best f all she is Canadaian, my favourite songs are Bad Boy and Shook!!! Awesome Cd is all i have to say!"
3,Keshia Chante!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Late last year, I saw the video for her single bad boy on bet. Since then she has not been seen here in the states. I was hoping to get the album what i had found out is that there is no release of album here in the states. The import is really expensive. I really like the album is awesome. One thing artists need to make us releases instead of paying them over net and not in stores. Us is the hardest place to get out albums out if your new artists and it depends what record company your on. So that's why they have imports. If you like pop music/r&b it's a great collection."
4,great cd!!!,"this is a great cd if you like pop or r&b music!! she is a great singer, is from my hometown of ottawa, and is really pretty!! my favorite song on the album is ""spinnin'"" the other songs are good too though! way to go girl!!! keep it up!"
4,Next best thing to Octoberfest.,This music is just what they play at the Octoberfests here inCincinnati. I makes me feel like I am dancing and raising mymug high. All music in upbeat and fun.Very lively. Buy it andplay it is your car.
5,20TH century music into funk,"I AM 29 YEARS OLD AND A STUDENT OF MUSICAL COMPOSITION. THIS ALBUM I THINK IS A MILESTONE IN NOT ONLY JAZZ BUT TODAY'S MUSIC. BIG BROTHER RANDY BRECKER IS A GREAT COMPOSER, TRUMPETIST, EVEN A SONG WRITER. MICHAEL B. NOT TO MENTION! LIKE A BEST OF.. ALBUM FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END.WISH I HAD THE VINYL COPY OF THIS ANYWAY. 1975 WAS DEFINITLY BB HORN SECTION YEAR! I ALSO SAW THEM LIVE IN 1994 IN ISTANBUL. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE ALBUM AND YOU ARE A MUSIC LOVER, HAVE IT!!!"
5,Gong - 'Est Mort' (Celluloid/dist. by Voiceprint),"Top notch seventy-minute recording from a gig that took place at the Hippodrome in Paris on May 28,1977 during a one-off reunion performance.Features the classic Gong line-up of Allen,Smyth,Blake,Hillage,Howlett,Malherbe and Pyle.Includes many of the old Gong favorites,like ""I've Been Stoned Before"",""Radio Gnome"",the exceptionally done ""Zero The Hero&The Witch's Spell"",""Flute Salad,""Master Builder"" and the celestial ""Sprinkling Of The Clouds"".This CD will be giving some Gong fans a wet dream.These ten tracks are arguably the BEST live versions of these songs I've ever heard.That's probably because guitarist Steve Hillage and synthesiser wiz Tim Blake are giving 110%.Highly recommended."
4,Excellent example of live Gong,"Recorded at the peak years of Gong's existence, circa '73, this double disc represents a great example of what a tight and upbeat group Gong was in concert, capable of offering up both very spacey and ethereal sound, as well as tight, strongly rythmic playing. Although normally thought of as a very spaced-out group, Gong was a well rehearsed unit and were capable of presenting their material very successfully in concert, as these discs attest to, arguably surpassing the studio versions of everything presented on this recording. Definately as absolute must for Gong fans, or anyone who enjoys progressive rock."
4,Good cleaning tool.,"Works well on most things, but has difficulty with pet hair on carpets and fabrics. Otherwise, I'm quite satisfied with this product."
1,No Good!,"Hi, I can't believe I fell for all the other reviews. This did not even last the 9 min it states in the pamphlet, and yes, I did charge it for the 16 hours it calls for. It also does NOT pick up pet hair unless it's off a bare floor. The suction is terrible, do not fall for this gadget unless it's to use on bare floors or for quick non-stuck pick up."
5,Lots of dogs,"I have two large dogs and a cat. We were constantly stepping on hard pieces of treats and bisquits. This dustbuster is great, powerful enoungh to get large chunks of treats or even dog hair. It is easy to handle, and clean. A definite improvement over the old dustbuster I had before."
4,Good dustbuster,"Nice suction for a small vac, engineered well, lightweight and comes with a nice attachment for vacuuming in tight spaces. The only con is that the charge only lasts 15-20 minutes, which is OK, but wish it lasted a little longer. It charges fast though. Overall for the price and quality, I recommend it!"
5,dustbuster,This dustbuster is powerful! I have an older model of it and bought this one for xmas present. It arrived really fast and was in good shape.
3,"Great suction, HORRIBLE battery life!","I bought this from amazon for $7.50 and free shipping with prime! You can use it for about 5 mins before the battery starts winding down and this is when it sits on the charger all day and night! I just re-read the description and realized its only 11 mins of charge WTH? There should be an option to use a power cord! Anyway Good Suction, Quick easy use and easy clean, but the battery takes all the goods away!For $8 shipped tho i wont complain too much!:P"
4,Good reliable hand vacuum,This is a very good hand vacuum for cleaning small messes and for removing dust in easy to reach areas. No complaints.
3,Dust Buster,[...]It hurts our ears with the loud whine. You need ear protection to use it.But it does the job it was designed for
2,Farewell to Customer Service,"Product works great for the first few months. After that, the battery dies and can't be re-charged. Customer service will no longer replace the product by mail -- you are required to drive to a service center (in my case, over an hour away and in a run-down neighborhood). Considering this happens to all Dustbusters now (this is my third), it is extremely disappointing to have a product that keeps failing, and won't be easily replaced. Why do I keep buying them if they keep dying, and CS is so poor? Because it's the best handheld vacuum out there (strong, cordless, easy to clean, etc.). Make sure to wait until you can get one at a heavy discount, so you won't be disappointed when you have to throw it out in a few months."
4,A Good Value,"This hand vacuum picks up dust and dirt much more efficiently than the one we had before. It is also easier to clean, and replacement filters are easy to get. We are very happy with it."
2,Okay at first,The unit runs fine at first. After a few months of weekly use (very light) the unit begins to slow down after about 30 seconds. Have attempted to buy new batteries but this seems impossible. Only way that I can see is to purchase individual batteries and build a new battery pack.After this experience I think Black & Decker is to be avoided. I'm now throwing my $39.99 dustbuster in the trash.
1,Black & Decker 9.6 volt DustBuster,Does a good job with surface dust. Not enough power to be effective with anything else. Design of product causes constant clogging.
4,"Good value, works well.","We use it to clean up after a 2 yr. old, crumbs cheerios even fruit pieces works well and provides good suction."
4,I like it,This little vac has plenty of power for the uses that I have for it. I use it mostly to clean up crumbs and birdseed and it does that great. Haven't tried it on anything bigger.
3,Needs improvement,"After using this handheld vacuum, I thought back to my mother's first generation DustBuster from the 80s and decided that the invention has not come very far since then. The suction is barely sufficient for most jobs and mostly scoots around anything clingy (pet hair, etc). I think for the money, it does its job, but I would prefer to go up a step--possibly to something heavy duty--a shop vacuum of some sort. I don't know what the ""cyclonic"" claim is trying to indicate, but I have seen no evidence that it functions any differently from other DustBusters in the past."
4,Great little Vac !,"This is a powerful little dustbuster! It would rate 5 stars if it was easier to reattach to the base for charging. For some reason, the ""lock in place"" design on this DustBuster is very cumbersome to attach to the charger (when wall mounted). It doesn't just ""snap"" into place as my older ones did. With frequent use, I've gotten better & quicker at putting it back in its charger. Other than that, I would say it is a very good (and loud!) product!"
4,worth the money,I purchased this product on sale through amazon and it is worth the money I paid for it. It is rechargeable and powerful. Very convenient for household dirt and picking up stuff.
4,"Great deal, very good tool","I was fortunate enough to get one of these through Amazon's Gold Box deals for about $10. We have had one of these in our home for about three years, and just recently the battery has started to have a noticeably shorter life. So, I was able to get a whole new unit for about the price that it would cost to replace the filter! Anyhow, you're probably more interested in how it works. This dustbuster does a great job of sucking up anything around it - it's very strong. The battery lasted us for quite a while, and the included attachments that clip right into the bottom of the unit are very useful. It's not too heavy and is easy to maneuver."
2,Dust buster is dusty,"In owning this, I have had no problem with this machine as the batteries are concerned. My opinion is that when I start this buster, what I have just picked up with it, comes out of the vents. I have changed the filters, as well as the filter types and with all the same results. Just seems that if I use this, I must take my larger vacuum out and go over the area again. Especially with younger children around the house, I want to make sure it is super clean. I like the size and recharging system. Cleaning this is dirty also. When the cover comes off, you must put your hands into the filter and remove the filter. Some filters, like the one I am currently using, can be cleaned and reused. I will be looking for another type. Sorry Dust Buster, but you busted this one."
2,Starts off great... but battery performance declines quickly,"We've had this vacuum for a little over a year. It's powerful enough to pick up crumbs an dust around the kitchen. Overall, we're happy with this vacuum with one exception: the battery went bad after one year. Emptying the dust bin is easy and the vacuum doesn't exhaust must dust."
3,"It's good, but it doesn't do cat hairs.","It's powerful for spilled dirt and dust and debris, but it doesn't get cat hair off my sofa. That's what I bought it for."
1,WILL NOT LAST,"Pay attention to the reviewers that have informed you this unit will not last and the battery is not replaceable. I would have given it 5 Stars had I done a review in the first month of ownership. In less than a year of once a week use, you'll hear the motor rpm start dropping as soon as you turn it on. Vacuum power will be worthless in under a minute. Better to donate your money to a worthy cause and help save our landfills. At least I can say this product doesn't suck."
5,"Battery Died, Very Short Life","UPDATE: Would change from 5 star(rating after having unit only several mos) to 1 star if I could. After following detailed directions from customer rep on how to incr battery life (which are diff from that in instruc manual), it still died in less than 2yrs of infrequent use. Only authorized dealer has replacemt battery and it costs as much as buying new unit ($31. with ship). Would NEVER buy again or recommnend."
3,"Not very strong, but still useful","This hand vacuum is light and picks up your basic dust/pet hair/etc. Cleaning and emptying it is also easy, and a quick rinse of the removable portion keeps it tidy. I just wish it were a bit stronger - I bought this one when it was on sale for $20, but now there's another hand vacuum that's stronger and also includes different nozzles for the same price. Also the instructions say that the recharging stand must be wall-mounted, so get ready to drill some holes in your wall if you're getting this item. I didn't install it in my wall and the recharging stand works well enough, but it's a thin plastic thing and plugging the hand vac back on is a little awkward."
4,nice portable little vacuum,"Nice vacuum and it's good product, save me alot of hastle.I got it for a very nice deal and i would recommended it."
5,Great Product Great Price,I got the whole thing delivered for under $16. And it works great. I am very happy
5,B & D and Amazon rock!,Great dustbuster! This one replaces a 20 year old dustbuster that was still working. I just needed an update. It's perfect and Amazon prices and services CANNOT be beat!!
4,Works well with 2 little boys!,"We've got two little boys and this works great on all of the little messes. The only complaint is that the base is designed a little funny, and you have to be careful about pulling it off. I almost pulled the thing off the wall once... other than that, very good product."
5,"So Far, So Good","I've only used this for three months. So far it's been excellent. I previously owned ""dustbusters"" and have been satisfied with their performance. Each newer model seems better than the one it replaces. I've read the other reviews, although not before purchasing this one. The suction of this one is FAR SUPERIOR to those I've previously owned. I use it mainly around the home to clean up small spills or my cars floor mats (rubber). Most of the complaints seem to be that it won't suck pet hair off a sofa or rug and only stays charged for only 10 minutes of use. I purchased mine to use on relatively minor clean up jobs and I'm very happy so far. For large jobs - pet hair, constant used for over 10 minutes and when greater suction is needed; I drag out my canister or upright vacuum. I'll try to update this review in about one year. Thank you."
5,great pick-up power,This is larger than my first dust buster but it takes up no more room than the original. It has great pick-up power and I find myself grabing it instead of the vacuum cleaner to do small jobs. It is lightweight and handy. I love it.
1,do not buy,This product says it contains lead and you should wash your hands after use. It also says not to use around children. I returned it because of this.
1,This product sucks!!!!,"I received this product and placed it in the charger and it turns out that the charger didn't work at all, or if it did there is no indication that it was even charging since the charging light didn't do anything. I called the manufacturer and got a replacement charger only to find out that that charger didn't work either. I assume the actual dustbuster was defective but was so tired of dealing with this product, I decided just to take the loss and didn't bother getting it replaced. What a waste of money!"
4,The Old Days of the Snail in a Pail,"This vacuum snail collector works on the principle that ""masses are better"", whereby collecting a large number of snails will thereby cut the labor time it normally takes to amass such creatures. It uses a .6g vacuum engine which is quiet and sturdy, doesn't need maintenance and can even be used near ponds, where snails tend to congregate. If you are a restaurateur, then this is a great product for selling ""fake French escargots"" for the amount it takes to pay a hermit to collect them."
3,"Works very well, that is until...","the batteries start to age. Then it won't hold a charge for very long. Instead of a buying a new one, here's a way to ""rebuild"" the pack:http://forums.batteryspace.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9824"
2,Would be good if not for the battery,"I can complain about the Dustbuster's nasty habit of lasting only 1 to 2 years, but what good would that do? The only way around this problem is to manufacture a competing brand or offer a battery upgrade as an aftermarket service.I wonder if David Oreck is listening."
4,Battery replacement,"After five years,having treated the NiCad batteries with respect and regular full discharges, the battery pack faded after about 30 seconds, so I went a-Googling for ""black and decker dustbuster parts"" and lo and behold, there was a site that not only had it, there was a description of how to take the old pack out and put the new one in. My CHV 9600 Dustbuster is working well again."
2,Poor battery life--runs out in 15 minutes,It cleans well but the battery runs out so quickly so it is quite inconvenient.
2,Disappointment in battery life,"I also was impressed with the Dust Buster, until, only 15 months later, the battery died. And to find out that you can't replace it. Very disappointing. Don't buy a dustbuster, unless you want to replace each and every year!"
5,Great power and pretty light weight,"This has been a great product. It is pretty powerful so it picks up virtually everything I've tried vaccuuming up. I like that it's pretty light-weight (easy enough for my 2-yr-old to use). Many previous reviews mention that the battery dies quickly, which is probably true if you put it back on the charger after every use. All you need to do is keep it OFF the charger until it loses power, then charge it up fully. Doing this, our battery has kept its full life. Overall, a great product."
3,"OK product, about what I expected","I've had my Dustbuster for about 3 years, I think. When it was new, it performed great! Excellent suction and long battery life (maybe 10 minutes? I never actually used it that long at one time). It still performs OK, although suction is maybe half as powerful and it runs down fairly quickly (maybe after a minute or two?). I've come to expect Dustbuster batteries to only last 2-3 years. Disappointing but what else are you gonna buy? (My previous Dustbuster had removable batteries. Unfortunately, the replacement batteries cost more than a new unit!)"
5,Works great,"I was pleasantly surprised at the strong suction on this machine. I'm very happy with it. The only slightly negative thing is that it's definitely heavier than our previous Dustbuster, but that is reaonable considering the stronger motor."
5,Great!,"I love this dustbuster! my last one had no power, but this is very powerful and has attachments! couldn't be happier."
3,only ok,"I picked up this book partly because the blurb in the back said that he's comparable to Ruth Rendall. Unfortunately, I found him far from being comparable in a good light beyond the generics of background. I could predict how the murder would be resolved almost from the beginning, which was disappointing. The secondary characters were too one-dimensional as well. Even though the plot was predictable, the book moved at a good pace which is why I wasn't bored. I could only imagine that he has other books that are better if he's been compared to Rendall."
1,What a Rip-Off!,"This book is Identical in every way to ""Final Account"" except for the title and the Copyright date! It is even listed by Amazon as a recomendation to those who bought Final Account which is how I wound up with it. Imagine my disappointment when I opened the book to find this out. I enjoyed Final Account but it really steams me to have paid for it TWICE!"
4,Inspector Banks Comes of Age,"I'm a huge fan of the Scottish writer Ian Rankin, so when I heard him favourably compared to Peter Robinson, I had to check the latter out. Of course I started with the first of the Inspector Banks series and was surprised to find no similarity to the Rankin books at all. The Robinson novel was a modern variation of the cozy English village police procedural made famous by so many other writers. Where was the grit of Rankin, the complicated psychology? Well here it is, finally, in Robinson's sixth Banks mystery, recently reissued. This is a fine piece of work, masterfully written, with a truly surprising ending. Now I know why reviewers have mentioned Rankin (a must read) and Robinson in the same breath. And I'll definitely be reading more."
2,Exact Book As Final Account,"I wish I had read the reviews before ordering this book. I read all of Robinson and was delighted to see a ""new"" title. When I received it, it was familiar right away, but I knew I had not read any book by this title. This is a Pan paperback publication, and Final Account is an American publication. I expected the Final Account copywright page to list ""Previously published as..."", but it was not there. It was not possible to ""look inside the book"" to get the copywright date, so I don't know how you would have avoided this error, except to have read the reviews. Actually, it was ok the second time around!"
3,It's an O.K. Banks book,My chief complaint is it was too long. The conflict with his wife was too contrived - - and unreal since he was lusting after another woman. Peter Robinson is either very good or boring - - and I found this book rather boring.
2,Bloody barbaric detectives,"Oh my gosh,this book was a pain.The first 200 pages were ok but after that,the story loses heat and dragged on without a plot.The writing was mediocre and lazy as if he were in a rush to finish this book.Also,Banks was a very unlikeable character.He was lusting after Pamela when he was already married,he got into a fight in a pub and he came across as a very unsentimental man.Other than that,the detectives in this book,other than Susan,were just plain barbaric.They acted like criminals instead of detectives.And the part about the ""shaved pussies""was totally disgusting.All in all,the book was a pain to read.The contrived plot,mediocre writing plus all the unlikeable characters just make this a very bad book."
3,Average Robinson,"This is a worthy book by Peter Robinson, only it's not his best. It's typical in that Inspector Banks works the clues and interviews to find the killer of a boring accountant. And the ending is a big surprise, but one that borders on unreality. But Robinson is a journeyman author and he never lets the book get away from him. You can always count on Robinson to provide a solid, steady book that holds your interest throughout. I just feel, however, that this is not his best effort."
4,Dry Bones That Dream,"I would recommend the Inspector Banks books to anyone interested in crime stories. Peter Robinson writes easy to read, intriguing stories."
3,"Good book, messed up CD","The book seems to be a very good one (I say seems only because I got it so recently that I don't know it thoroughly). I'm an intermediate player and have already learned a lot from it. The problem, and it's a kind of a big one, is that the recording, which was originally a tape, was played at the wrong speed when they transferred it to CD so that you CANNOT play along with the recording with a C harp. The CD is about a half step flat, so that, well, you can imagine how playing along would sound. Also, the track numbering is off."
5,"Wow, wow wow....","The variety show is an strange art. Most people take it or leave it. But is an great shortlived series ala Donny & Marie. I seen this series on TV, and proud to say about time this was on DVD. Bravo to this collection and thank you Amazon.com...."
4,again...days remembered,This is another attempt to follow Carol Burnette. I was 9 years old and looked forward to this weekly show. a must for nostalgia!
4,I LOVE THESE OLD VARIETY SHOWS,"THE BEST THING ABOUT THESE VARIETY SHOWS FROM THE 1970'S ARE ALL THE GREAT GUEST STARS, IM GETTING THIS JUST FOR THE CHARLIE'S ANGELS AND WELCOME BACK KOTTER CASTS WHO GUEST STARRED ON THE CAPTAIN AND TENNILLE AND IM SURE ALOT OF OTHERS THAT I HAVE NOT MENTIONED! I ONLY HOPE THE STUDIOS RELEASE MERV GRIFFIN,MIKE DOUGLAS AND DINAH SHORE SHOWS AS WELL AND MORE SONNY AND CHER COLLECTIONS! SO IF YOUR A FAN OF THE STARS FROM THE MID-LATE 70'S YOU WILL ENJOY THIS! I CAN'T WAIT FOR MINE"
3,Question for everybody who's bought this...,"I don't actually own this, so this isn't a review proper - just a question for those of you who HAVE bought it. I only saw 2-3 episodes when this was originally aired, mostly didn't think much of it, and mostly can't remember anything...EXCEPT for a single musical number. It was an instrumental and featured the Cap'n soloing on a Minimoog (or, possibly, an ARP Odyssey) and thereby impressing the hell out of my 9-year old self. Watching Daryl make all kinds of fantastic sci-fi noises just by twisting all those knobs - I was blown away! And I'd love to see it again; so, I'm just wondering if that performance appears anywhere on the DVDs. I appreciate your replies. Thank you!"
4,Nice but a bit dated and the comedy sucks,"I like this set even though the comedy is mediocre to downright awful. The best part of the set is perhaps the nostalgia one feels for the 1970s. I enjoyed watching the cast of ""What's Happening"" on the show in addition to other stars of the 70s.The Captain aka Daryl Dragon has the personality of a tree stump, and I can't believe that acting or other lessons wouldn't have helped him. Perhaps Tennille would've had a better career if she had a male partner with half a breath."
3,the thrill is gone,"When I bought this, I thought that I would either love it or think it was sooo boring but I had to see it again after all these years.Unfortunately, I found myself skipping alot of the silly skits and the very unattractive guest singers. Yes, Toni can sing and yes, Daryl can play, but that's about it. If I had to pick a favorite episode, it would be the one with Charlie's Angels(I liked the 3 little pigs skit and when Toni sang ""The Hungry Years"") NOW, I have finally seen the light as to why this show only lasted one year."
2,"Great concept, flawed execution","It's a sweet enough story, but my problem is that this is supposed to be a book to help teach kids how to read. Yet on EVERY SINGLE PAGE, the phrase ""I've got"" is used when ""I have"" would be grammatically more precise. Also, a picky point: the author rhymes ""engineers"" and ""ears."" Sorry, but ""eers"" and ""ears"" don't rhyme; they're the SAME SOUND. If we're going to teach kids to read and, eventually, to write, we need to give them good examples, not sloppy ones."
2,get a different game,"When I saw this in the store, I thought it looked like a pretty cool game. The graphics are pretty good but the gameplay is terrible. It takes way to long to load scenes and because of this, I just can't get into the game. About 10-20 minutes is all I can take. There are lots of other Dreamcast games out there that are better than this one."
3,Slave Zero,"I have played the game and to me despite all the other clames of it being ""the worst game ever"" i thought it was pretty fun to play. Since i am not a game maker I don't know half of the stuff the other people are talking about but I thought the game was pretty fun. The whole idea of running around and blowing stuff up in a big machine always does sound pretty fun and it is."
2,Yowsers-- this game is not very good,"With a framerate that slows to a crawl and a less-than-engaging linear design, Slave Zero is a very disappointing game. The graphics are nice-looking, but actually playing the game will make you feel like you're watching a slide show. It makes me wonder how it got all these good reviews. My guess? Infogrames has their employees post glowing reviews on their own games to gloss over the few REAL customer reviews."
1,"Slave Zero is just that a ""ZERO""","One of the many things that I don't like about the game is that you don't get to choose from any different characters. Then there is the problem that you only get one life, and if you die you have to repeat the game all over again. Overall, Sega should be paying me to play this game and not the other way around!"
5,this is the underdog hit for dreamcast,"okay it's been said already but here's the ONLY negative: occasionly slow (but unobtrusive) frame rate.As for the pros: Great gameplay, Solid control, Inventive and unique levels, Well balanced difficulty levels, Great graphics give it that futuristic sci-fi feel, GREAT 4-PLAYER DEATHMATCH and... GREAT 4-PLAYER DEATHMATCH!"
1,GEEZ! What a shame!,Can u say choppy? Just get the PC version for good fun. The frame rate is under 30 and it is really a shame cuz it looked beautiful and fun. BAH well!
4,Slave,"Hey, love the action, great weapons, and bots, but is it just me.. or is the ultra slave unbeatable? Zero has lovely gameplay, and I like the game, but it seems to me that I gather alot of weapons, and I know the plot line, have enormous health, and still I cannot beat the last man. Am I to resort to codes or what?"
5,This game rocks,I love this game though i'm still only on the first level. It is the funest game that i have on my dreamcast. It is a must buy for those who love action war games. And for the price that I got it at. Well I'll just say this it is worth your ten dollars. If you are intereted in robotics you would probably love this game. This is definitely not a game for wosses that get scared easilly.
2,what happened?,"i had such high expectations for this game, but after i boughtthis was i let down. it starts off good but gradually gets verybad. this game has good ideas: unrelenting enemies, cool looking robots. those are the good points. the bad points are very low frame rate when there are multiple enemies on the screen at the same time, also the sound qaulity is bad. this could be a great game if these problems didn't exist better luck next time infogames."
3,Slave Zero-- not bad/not good,"In all my years of gaming, I can truly say FINALLY that Sega has a good shooting/Doom/whatever game. The problem is you can't really aim that well without getting shot about fifty times. The multiplayer is average; online-capability would've been sweet. All in all, the graphics are, like any other Dreamcast game worth its salt, breathtaking. The sounds are nice, with explosions and speaking roles (not too bad voice acting, if I might add) however, the gameplay tends to wear thin and becomes stale after about three weeks. But thy'll be the best spent three weeks of your life. Get it. Now."
4,Your guide to the Family History Library,"I find this will be a great help in getting around the Family History Library as this is my first trip there. Knowing where things are and how to prepare will help me take full advantage of my limited time there. Having been told knowing what you want and where in the Library it is, will save me much time and effort, this book doest just that for me."
2,Started good but...,"Well, this started out interesting, but then it fell, not only flat, but not understandable. I had a hard time trying to figure out what was even going on. I think this story could have been written better though. The fault is on the author here, IMO.The characters' actions sometimes made absolutely no sense, and were so unrealistic, I actually found myself struggling to picture the story happening. Also, a lot of times it was not clear who was speaking, or what they were speaking about, or even what was happening. I had to read paragraphs over and over to finally grasp what I had just read. And then after that, I'd think, Why would THAT happen? Or, Why on earth did she let her mother do that?"
1,Missing pages and amazon's unwillingness to help,"Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!When I examined my Greek New Testament, I found that it was missing Ephesians through 1 Peter. Luckily, those books are not that important. Oh wait, yes they are! But not to worry, Amazon backs all their products- except this one. Actually they will not replace, refund, or credit your account, but they will keep you on hold and subject you to elevator music."
4,Predecessor to Eden of the East,"If you like this anime, you will love Eden of the East since the character designer, director, music composer and many of the original voices follow on the other anime. I started watching eden first and then went back to watch this and its funny how the artist decided to use some of the characters from this anime in the other one. Once you watch the two, you will instantly know what I am talking about and recognize Takizawa, the guy with glasses, and Mr. Outsider. But Eden of the east is far better in every way, I think it shows how much the skills of the creators has evolved from Honey Clover. My only gripe with this is WTF were they thinking when they added that little 6 year old girl as a love interest for that guy. I dont care how old you say she is, this was done on purpose due to the perverted mind of many japanese anime creators. I hate it when they do that."
2,Not what I thought...,"I thought this would be more of an in depth self help kind of book. It wasnt. Come to find out all this authors books are pretty much the same.Could be good for others, but wasnt what I expected at all."
5,sad songs for indie fans,"Summer at Shatter Creek writes the saddest songs you'll ever hear. Almost every song on this EP is also on All the Answers, but it's still a geeat little ep, there is not one weak track.The music is basically guitar and keyboard with vocals, but it works perfectly in the grandest indie fashion."
1,Don't support racism,"I'm sorry, but Maurice's defence is of a culture hopelessly tainted by racism. He is the sort of man who would have supported slavery and who did support segregation. He disgusts me.Maurice! Leading us backwards!"
5,"Refreshing, Exotic, and Hypnotic","FINALLY. A lullaby cd that actually will put both you and baby into a coma-like sleep or trance (lol)! No silly words,no baby talk or sing-songy verses, just pure unadulterated soothing acoustics (with some backgound sounds added to a few of the tracks to enhance your listening pleasure). This CD is guaranteed to relieve stress & put an end to any and all foul moods etc... Each track has such a calming effect on little ones and now is the time to expose them to a more sophisticated sound. No lullaby library is complete without this winner!"
5,"Rich, deep and authentic.","It's been a while since I first read the book, but looking back I can remember feeling how rich it was. I don't feel most books...but Roshi's teaching really touched me and seemed alive. I highly suggest that you read this book and if you like it you will probably love his audio series Breath Sweeps Mind...which I've listened to almost half a dozen times...it's fantastic.If you ever find yourself around Northern California, do yourself a favor and visit the Sonoma Mountain Zen Center, it's a wonderful place to spend a day."
1,misleading and disappointing!,"book lacks zen teaching value...represents authors ambitions as a teacher. does not represent ""the intimate heart of zen""... nor does it contain zen wisdom or depth. tries to capitalize on zen phrases...but does not deliver. forward was written by thich nhat hanh who has written many insightful books....disappointed, am returning book."
4,Christmas Bells,"No carillons here, so if you want a carillon recording, this isn't it. (try Carillon of the Belfry of Ghent instead.) This is the Christmas Eve edition of Adventures in Good Music, with Karl Haas at the piano, and selected European church bells calling the faithful to worship. The CD is made worthwile by the precision drill team singing of the St. Olaf Choir on four tracks. Three stars for Karl Haas and the bells, five stars for the St. Olaf Choir."
5,A Rare Look At Toshiko's Orchestra,"An excellent concert by one of the greatest modern big bands. Outstanding solos by Toshiko, Lew Tabackin, and others. And Frank Wess in the band!By all means, get this if you don't have it already. And ignore that silly one-star review!"
5,A gripping journey on cheating life but not one's heart,"Mr. Reed, I had a hard time putting ""A Face"" down. When I did, I couldn't wait to continue the next segment. With each page dragging me through familiar places, I found myself desiring a night with Gary. And although I figured out the plot and ending half way through, I found myself longing for your clever, descriptive verbiage as it cut into my own imagery. The ride was exciting and familiar - mostly in my darkest, hidden fantasies. I loved it! I recommend it. Thanks for the good time..."
1,Not What I Expected,"After reading some of the glowing reviews here, I decided to read this book. It did not meet my expectations. I was very offended by all the violence, most of which didn't even seem necessary to carry the story along."
1,Disappointing.,"After buying this book based on the reader's reviews here, this reader was left disappointed.I found that this book was not so much a statement on the times we live in as an excuse for flashy look-at-me-I-went-to-writing-school excesses.The heaps of gratuitousness in this book did not impress me. Nor did the thin plot.I would have much rather spent the time re-reading ""The Picture of Dorian Gray""."
2,On the bland side,"If you really like oysters, there is a reason these are so inexpensive - they are bland. If you're just looking for something healthy, these qualify."
5,The Most Underrated Musician of that era!!,"There's been more than one occassion socially, when speaking of music of the late 50's and early 60's, if I mention the name Gene Vincent, people go ""Who?"" And then I start to sing ""Be Bop A Lula"" and they say, ""Oh yeah!.....So THAT'S who sang that?!"" Well, duh! It irritates me to no end!I agree with Timothy in that it's a shame Gene Vincent isn't mentioned in the same sentence with Elvis or Buddy Holly. He was as good as if not superior.I discovered Gene Vincent in the 90's and was hooked immediately. This guy could rock! His audio recordings are so full of life that one can only imagine how it was to see him perform live."
4,Rockin with the Catman,"Want to get to know Gene and the Bluecaps? then this CD is for you! This collection shows a good all around sound and style of the CATMAN, Gene Vincent. This man like to rock, and the Screaming End will take you through all the emotions of a Bluecaps album! From the slower, WOMEN LOVE to the, trying to RACE WITH THE DEVIL, your gonna rock with the CATMAN! All the emotions of the 50's with CRUISIN and PINK THUNDERBIRD! Tired of Elvis,Holly,Fabian? Discover a new drive in 50's guitar and the voice of a definite 50's rocker! Look-out devil, the catman's coming, you better watch-out! You'll find the capitol recordings the best sounding quality when searching the Gene Vincent catolog. (Also the best work of the Bluecaps.) The 50's still rock and Gene Vincent is the Catman who helps keeping it shakin'. Add this one to your 50's collection!"
3,ordered CD-received DVD,Music is great: classic Gene Vincent. Was very disappointed to discover it would only play in a DVD player. Sent the first disc back as defective. When the second disc wasn't recognized as a CD I tried it in my DVD player. Got audio w/o video.
4,K-os,"I am pleased but not impressed. I enjoy the product but not as thoroughly as I enjoyed EXIT. I don't think it flowed as well as EXIT, it was a masterpiece. I still have not gotten Joyious Rebellion but I think it will be more like EXIT. I feel like K-os was experimenting with this one. Nevertheless, I like his vibe and will continue to support his projects."
4,"Not as great as Yes!, but very good",Several OUTSTANDING tracks. a few worth skipping over in a mix. various styles mastered wonderfully throughout. K-os should have thrown a few of these tracks on a b-side and produced a flawless album. i guess too many tracks is better than too few.
4,Great views!!,This book is exciting as well as informative. Steve Meyer's essay is extraordinary! Great info! I can't wait to read it again!!
3,An average remake,"This is a reissue of the original late 70's album. Although it has a few goodies like ""Where's the Fire"" and ""Rockers"", it doesn't have the outstanding cut ""Out on the Street"" by American Noise. I do not know why it was left off this reissue, but without this cut the album is not nearly as good. Could have used a cut by the Numbers Band too."
4,Cleveland Rocks,"If you're looking for a reminder of what the rock scene was like in Cleveland in the late 70s, early 80s, look no further!This is a great compilation of tunes by Cleveland's finest- Wild Horses, Phil Barker of Flatbush, Alex Bevan (Although I was surprised 'Skinny Little Boy' was not included- the epitome of Cleveland rock anthems!).Long live the Buzzard!"
1,Incomplete!,"Attractive cover, glossy pages--but missing whole passages! I bought this book to adapt a British translation of the play into contemporary English: by looking at the original text I would be able to revise the 1922 English translation. When I went to compare the original to the translation, whole sections of each act are missing. If this is meant to be a condensation, the book does not state it anywhere. I had to order a different edition."
2,Fairy Tales,"The author seems to spend most of his time writing about guyanese folklore, instead of writing about guyans rich history. This book Sucks"
5,Bravo!,"Exceptional! A metegee is a traditional Guyanese dish with everything included and that's exactly what this is. As a daughter of Guynana, I was blown away. This will be my gift to all family members for the next year. Metegee includes culture, politics, sayings and was a fascinating study of life in a British post-colony. I was never bored reading it and suggest not only that all Guyanese families own one, but all Caribbeans. For a self-publishing volume, this book was very well done. I would love to take a class with the creative and gifted author."
1,"waste of money, inaccurate","purchased this scale and it weighs very inaccuratelly. it also cannot weigh anything accuratelly under one gram. my advice, buy the similar looking blade scale from american weigh"
4,Waterless bath review,"I was always skeptical about these waterless bath products, I usually use a spray of 1 part listerine and 9 parts water and this works much better.I take my dog to the dog park everyday and he usually gets a daily ""saliva bath"". He's a golden too so his first gets stuck as if hair gel was put on him. Well I brush him after the park everyday and I just used this stuff last night. I sprayed and rubbed it in as directed and once I finished brushing his coat felt clean and smooth, and his coat had a nicer shine to it. It dries super fast and brushing after was a breeze. Works great and will most likely buy some more."
3,Wasn't Particularly Happy,Maybe I'm just stupid but my Amstaff bitch has white markings around her neck and the prong collar leaves grey stains on it. I tried using this to get it off and it didn't really work. Blah. Maybe it's just for dirt.
3,Mean Spirited,There are some laughs in this one (I must have seen it dozens of times when it seemed like it was on cable infinite repeat in the 80s) but it does seem unnecessarily mean-spirited in restrospect.
4,Good,"I think it is funny, my wife, not so much. Chevy is always good. Funniest part is the demon powder."
2,Modern Problems,"Anchor Bay used to put out a quality product but when I received this DVD today and saw a production mark across the playing face of the disc I begin to wonder. I have not played the disc yet (and love the movie) but there is also zilch in the way of Special Features unless you get all enthused over a movie trailer. I am going to contact Anchor Bay and see what they will do (if anything) regarding the condition of this ""new"" DVD and may amend my review at that point."
1,Unfunny Film wastes talent of Chase,"This film is ulitimately forgettable, and wastes the talent of Chevy Chase. Buy or rent Caddyshack, Vacation, and Fletch, but Modern Problems really bored me."
4,Underrated Chevy Film,"This movie was not as popular as Chevy Chase's other films, but I loved watching it on cable as a teen. The jokes are, of course, has quite a bit of innuendo, but their funny.What's not to love about Dabney Coleman trying to reason with a man who uses his powers to slowly drag him across a wall.Oh, and the things he could do to his girlfriend by just raising his eyebrows.This was definitely a cookie movie, but it was fun, and interesting from the psychic powers point of view. I mean, if you're going to have powers, why not have a little fun with it?"
4,"Toxic avenger, Chevy Chase style",Max Fielder (Chevy Chase) has modern problems. Aside from being an overworked air traffic controller. He seems to have been thrown over by his sweetie (Patti D'ArbanVille). Sort of reconciliation is supposed to take place at a beach house with people that have strange personalities. This includes Mark (Dabney Coleman) who gets to play an obnoxious character as in most of his movies.He is doomed until a mishap or close encounter with radioactive waist transforms him into a telekinetic terror. Will he be able to get his sweetie back? Be sure to pay attention to the restaurant scene. You will never be able to eat out again with out thinking of it.
4,OK movie. EXCELLENT song!,"The movie made me laugh a couple of times and chuckle several times, but I would not own it if it weren't for the Tubes song over the closing credits. The song is not available anywhere else, so that alone makes the DVD worth twice the price."
1,And hour and a half of Chevy Chase mugging at the camera,"Chevy Chase tried too hard to be funny making up for a one-joke plot, poor direction and a cast that was obviously there to just pick up a paycheck. Bill Murray might have pulled this mess off, though. This movie is not funny. It's not cute. It's a waste of time."
2,Disappointing comedy,"An incredible cast is mostly wasted in this lackluster comedy. While the plot has great potential, the movie drags, and the special effects are terrible. A few genuinely funny moments, though, and Nell Carter is a hoot."
3,Please release on DVD -hoping 20th Cen. Fox is reading this,"I remember this movie as a youngin' and I must have seen it over and over and over especially The Tubes' title song at the end credits. I remember recording it onto a portable cassette player to listen to in my room. Ok, it was corny by today's standards, but definately some of Chevy Chase's funniest moments and it was alot of fun. C'Mon .....20st Century Fox ..lets release on DVD. I'v been telling my wife about Super Fuzz and Modern Problems both for years of which SF is coming out on DVD 12/7/04....finally."
3,A DAB OF DABNEY,"This movie has a major plus for fans of Dabney Colman. If you've always wanted to get a view of that prodigious posterior without the obstruction of fabric, this movie is for you. It's worth the purchase price!"
1,"A ""B"" film - and that stands for BAD","This is a sluggish, unfunny, poorly made movie that I would wager Chevy Chase is ashamed of. His later movies (like the ""Vacation"" series) are in a different league altogether. The actors all seemed to be asleep at the wheel in this one, probably due to the weird plot and uninspired directing."
5,.... and just when you thought it was NOT possible!,"This one is a fairly recent classic, and terrific for both you and your dog or puppy! It helped keep our household sane, and solved the problem too!As a nice big-size format book, it's easy to refer back to.The ""Three Things You Need to Know About Dog Behavior"" is excellent.The information and chapters on ""The Puppy Safe Room"" and ""The Puppy Playpen"" is probably the best in any book you can buy.""How Do I Correct Wrong Behavior"" and the material about discipline was a real life-saver for us.Highly recommended!"
3,It'sgood Tamil Masala Movie,"The movie is a typical 'masala' entertainer featuring Silambarasan as a daring youth, who wins the heart of a girl, who happens to be the daughter of a dreaded gangster. A remake of the recent Telugu hit Dil, Silambarasan figures stunt sequences and dances gleefully to peppy tunes."
3,"Excellent, but where is the great one?","This CD is marvelously inventive and only a little dated. But Andy Pratt's best album is a splendid exorcism of pain and fear that came out on Columbia Records in 1973. Alas, there is no response when you contact the e-mail address listed for the artist above, so I cannot tell you whether or not you can find Pratt's best record."
2,suzifan79,"This wasn't the cd that I thought it was, could've had something from {stumblin' in} on it."
4,A rare and heart-felt collection in trbute Suzi,"Quite frankly, folks, this is a testimony of how original Joan Jett, Lita Ford and Fiona Apple are NOT!!! Suzi began the movement of the ""Grrrl"" rock artists. This collection features the heart of Suzi, i.e.; ""Stumblin' In"", and a rare version at that. Also the sounds of Leather Tuscadero and of course the songs that made her what she is to me and the very limited, but dedicated fans, the original rock and roll sex Goddess. Please!! Don't let the image fool you. Suzi, at 5'2 and 92 lbs soaking wet, is as sweet and pure as Leather Tuscadero might've been if Joannie Cunnigham didn't need a role model of her genre. ENJOY!!!"
4,A great compilation of N.O. based stories,I bought this book for a class but I think I'll be keeping it for my own collection. Construction quality is very good. Pages are bible thin. Content is a great collection of stories about New Orleans.
2,Sin in the Sanctuary!,"I can see why this movie is offensive to the religious types! The plot is all about fleshly nuns who need an extended weekend of confession for their untamed sexual adventures in a convent. Overall, this has the potential to be a good flick except for the language barrier. It's not in English!"
1,For Rental Only,"Yes, this is typical Joe D'Amato. It is explicit, but the the scenes are relatively short. If your curious and can rent it then do so. I wish that I had now that I'm stuck with a movie I don't particularly like. I've seen quite a few of his films, and I have ""99 Women""( the explicit euro vers.), ""Emmanuel in America"" uncut just to name two. This movie is so bad that I've only seen a portion of it, and I have no intention of seeing the rest of it. I wish they would release ""Top Model"" as that was a good one."
5,An Excellent Murder Mystery/Thriller!!!RIP Oliver Reed,"This is a very good adaptation of an Agathie Christie novel . A group of strangers arrive at a mansion and then are slowly killed off one by one. The late, great Oliver Reed gives an excellent performance in this film and is dark and brooding as always but he is attractive to women which was a part of his onscreen and offscreen Charisma and Presence and I don't use those words very often to describe most actors.Elke Sommer is also very good and sadly we do not see enough of her in movies these days. I have always admired Oliver Reed for his staunch refusal to ""sell out"" and become a Major Hollywood star and he chose rather to be found drinking with his Working Class Mates down at his favourite Pub."
1,Worthless warrenty,Had problem with lock. Company claims it was energized too long. I open it up and there was one little burnt spot on the coil. If it was energized too long the whole coil would have been burnt. Mine only lasted about 5 months.
3,"Interesting, but I still prefer fabric pot holders....","They are a bit too stiff to act as a good pot holder, in my mind anyway. Perhaps if they were larger, I would't be quite so leery of them.I do find them nice to toss in the bottom of the sink to anchor my annodized pots while cleaning, and I'm sure they are very good hot pads...Kind of pricey for their value to me, but it seemed like a good idea at the time...Oh, and they are on the orange side of red....;0))PK"
3,MIU France Pot Holders,"The pot holders are okay but the silicone is a little stiff, which makes it a little difficult for me to pick some things up with them."
3,Too stiff,"Have been using these silicne potholders for about four months. They offer good heat protection but are very stiff and awkward to use. Difficult to get a good grip on hot dishes with small handles.MIU Silicone Pot Holders, Set of Two, Red"
5,Great for the messy cook!,"I admit these holders take a little getting used to, but after you get the hang of it, you'll probably find yourself using these more than any other pot holders in your kitchen. They have enough flexibility to safely remove hot dishes from the oven and, yet, are sturdy enough to be used as trivets. My favorite feature with these pot holders happens to be the ease in keeping them clean. Through my years of cooking, I always made a mess with my cloth pot holders--they always had food spills and burnt spots. No more. I just wash these off in the sink after a big meal and there you go, they're like new. As for the color, they are definitely not orange. Mine are a muted red."
4,Does it's job well,"These pot holders are nice decor when not in use, and they get the job done well when there are hot pots to be handled with."
3,Just ok,"These mostly get the job done, but if something is very hot you can't handle it for long with these. I would recommend the traditional pot holders for something so hot!"
4,Nice product - BUT picture of red is misleading,"As previously mentioned, while they call this red, it is really a burnt-orange. If you are trying to match some other red beware!The potholders themselves are very functional and if color isn't an issue, then buy these!"
3,Stiff,"I'm giving this 3 instead of 5 stars, because despite the fact that they are indeed a good insulation against heat, they are not very pliable. So you can use them to grap large handles, but not pans without handles .....like casseroles, cake or bread pans."
3,Stiff,"I purchased a similar pot holder 3 months ago at an indoor mall, but I definitely know these aren't the same brand because these are very stiff compared to my previous purchase. The other ones I purchased are very pliable. So, I use these mainly to sit pots on and not as pot holders."
2,Not acurate color description.,"The product itself is very useful when doing daily cooking tasks, only the color description is NOT ACURATE. What is described as RED, is in fact BRIGHT ORANGE."
3,"One superb song, but CD is not in stereo","This CD is most of the songs from a stereo LP Andy and his brothers released in about 1970. The song ""Holiday Season"" is very very good, and a favorite of mine...BUT....this particular CD was released by the CD company in MONO and is a poor recording. IF this was in STEREO, then I would say BUY IT, but since my copy, at least, is in MONO, I say either buy the old LP or wait for these folks to release this in stereo!"
1,You get what you pay for I guess...,"There's a reason this book is so cheap, sometimes you get exactly what you pay for. I loved Pigs Don't Fly, so I hoped this book would be just as good. It was NOT. Not even close.The story just rambled on and on, going nowhere. And the ending was...confusing, to say the least. I re-read the ending three times and I'm still not sure I know what happened. You turn the page to the last chapter, and think, 'am I missing some pages?' or 'is this some kind of misprint or something?' It just makes no sense. Terrible way to end a book, it just ruins the whole thing, not that there was much to ruin to begin with anyway."
3,"I read for pleasure, no other reason.","Mary Brown does in this book, exactly what an author is supposed to do, she took me out of my mundane world, allowed me to forget my aches and pains, and captured my imagination.All through the book she led me to beleive that the story's climax would not be the standard ""happily ever after"", yet she was not so heavy handed that I was allowed to anticipate the true ending. The ending was a surprize! I enjoyed this book."
5,A good sequel,This is a decent sequel. Still not as good as the first. It did bring the story more full circle. The first book is still my favorite.
2,Stop with Pigs Don't Fly,"While the writing is still as good as it was in the original book, stop there if you don't want your images and ideas of Summer and her friends to be destroyed. Personally, I thought it killed the great characters of the first book, changing them in ways I didn't think she should've. Maybe just me, but that's my 2 cents worth."
1,Greatly disappointed,"I loved Pigs Don't Fly and I was extremely disappointed with this story. The characters were uninteresting and the quest was boring. There were some interesting ideas in this story but unfortunately the author didn't elaborate on them. The ending was terrible. I didn't mind the sad ending but it seemed so little worthwhile to go through the whole quest for such a weak ending. Obviously, the ending was left open so the author can write another book which I hope is better than this one but I will miss the characters from Pigs Don't Fly, especially the pig and Summer since the author seems to do away with these characters in this book."
3,Where's the Passion?,"He's clearly very competent; however, I have several items of constructive (I hope) criticism): First, this is NOT for rank beginners..he assumes that the viewer has a lot of prior experience with other percussion instruments; e,g., he starts out with how to hold two mallets in each hand-jeez, I can barely figure out how to hold one. Second, there are a number of different ways to use the mallets--for instance, I've seen some commentaries about using first the left hand, then the right hand; other teachers suggest using the left hand to strike two bars, and then the right hand striking two bars--it would be good if he would discuss the pros and cons of both. Third, he shows no passion in either playing or teaching--I am not looking for a Tom Cruise jumping up and down on Oprah's guest sofa; but this guy is as dull as dish-water."
3,"Dissapointed with "" Made in Taiwan""",The tools look nice and they work well. I was dissapointed to see they were manufactured in Taiwan. I would have guessed since Facom owns S&K they would be made in the same location as Facom which is Europe. Not so. Should have done more research before purchasing.
5,low cost,everything was in there that i needed and the cost was much cheaper than a parts store for the same product
4,Interesting premise,"Though it does take a while to get into the plot, at first I thought I had bought something non-sci fi by mistake it is certainly and interest and unusual story. It isn't however my favourite work of Arthur C. Clarke's and one does get a little over the repeated verbal bashing of anyone with any kind of faith and Clarke's almost pointed intolerance and lack of understanding for the concepts people of faith hold dear. I do love the great detail of the scientific principles and forces at work but Clarke's disdain for faith is a bit two dimensional and it comes through in some of the characters. I would have given it three and a half stars if amazon could facilitate but it seemed to be worth better than three."
4,Standard Arthur C. Clarke writing,"Not his best work, but by far not his worst. It's a cohesive story from start to finish, with just enough science on one main topic (a space bridge) to make it all worth while. It's not a fast read and is more character driven than topic driven, but a good read if you liked his ""Rama"" (the first one) and ""Childhood's End."""
5,Clarke is an excellent writer,"Especially for one grounded in ""Hard"" science, himself contributing as much or more to ""Real"" science than his books have to fiction. He's credited mostly with the ""Communications Satellite"" for NASA, btw. Yet, for storytelling he goes more the ""Wells"" route, than the ""Verne"" route. While he's against Psuedoscience or hoping for a ""Hyperspace breakthrough"" he knows that over time current science will simply give way to now unconcievable breakthroughs and what may be impossible now may not be in an aeon. ""Magic is Science unexplained"" he said. ""Fountains of Paradise"" is more grounded in the nearer future, the building of a ""Space Elevator"", and that story being tied to a quest for ultimate power and greatness in the distant past. It is also a kind of tribute to Sri Lanka, the country he loved most of all the places he'd visited in his lifetime and the one he retired in."
4,Great use of real science and technology,This is a must-read for Clarke fans. The space-elevator he wrote about has a real basis in science and some scientists still consider it a legitimate and leading candidate for mass transportation off earth in the next phase of space exploration. The writing and characters are classic Clarke. You won't be disappointed.
4,"Usual Clarke themes, still great","Arthur C. Clarke novels often have some of the following elements: mankind progresses and invents new things, the inevitable clash with religion, the start of a new history of mankind and a meeting with alien life, most always more intelligent than us.And still, every novel is a joy to read as is ""The Fountains of Paradise"". An ambitious man wants to build an elevator from here to the geostationary orbit. The book follows the initial difficulties (economical, political and religious) to get the project started and then the building itself.There is a meeting with alien life, a little like in Rama and it teaches mankind a lot, though the link with the general story is hard to get sometimes.As always, this Clarke book is a great story about what mankind is able to do in a few centuries."
3,"read it for the experience, not the story","There is hardly any character development in this entire book. The story line is somewhat awkward. There are too many chapters (57) which only makes the story choppy.The whole plot revolves around the building and operation of an orbital tower or space elevator. The tower doesn't really play a big part of the story until almost half way through the book however. The author explains the technical problems in building the tower fairly well but I thought he could have done a better job in explaining exactly how the tower was built, what it looked like and exactly how it worked. The part of the book that was meant to be suspenseful wasn't to me because it was hard for me to visualize exactly what was happening and the physical surroundings.Also, I think it was way too easy to build that tower."
3,the ending is worth it,"The story here is seems really long and drawn-out, filled with characters that have little or no purpose at all. The main character, Vannemar, is the only one that seems to have any definition. The others are kinda meaningless. It's as if Clarke thought up the ending, then wrote a bunch of ""bla bla bla"" to lead up to it.The only thing that kept me interested was the Starglider side story. The Starglider was an unmanned alien craft that traveled to our solar system and used it's on-board computer to communicate with us.The ending is one of the best that Clarke has written. Which I thought made the entire book worth reading. Although I thought the characters and the rest of the story only served one purpose: filler."
3,"Not bad, worth a read....","I read this book after reading mostly positive reviews and enjoying many of Clark's other works. Overall, I liked it but would of rather had a little mroe interaction with the space elevator/tower. The subplots were OK and held together but the main concept I felt received too little ""airtime"" so to speak.Definitely worth a read and as one other reviewer stated, it's an easy book to get into with solid writing style and story flow."
5,A Jammin Cd,"his cd is different from the regular H-town rappin flava. its more universal. he has his own style and he's just crunk with it. y'all need to cop this album, if you ain't got it, go get it. every track you gonna feel."
4,Vintage!,I love the vintage look of this item and the matching items. It comes just as described and really looks great on my kitchen counter!
5,Excellent it cuts thru myth and presents the true story,"McNally did a great job of presenting and backing up all of his facts with historical documents that were uncovered in the early 80s in the archives in Budapest. He discounts all of the false legends regarding Elizabeth, including one that says she showered in young girls blood, bathed in, and drank it to remain youthful. Elizabeth tortured and killed servants merely because she enjoyed the act (similiar to Vlad The Impaler). It recounts the history of her family and her subsequent trial and house arrest, although she should have been executed along with her henchmen. The high body count she incurred sounds like a legend but some evidence did come out in the trial that did substantiate it as fact, im sorry but I wont mention it more than that cos I dont want to spoil it for you. If you want a well written, no-nonsense book about the Blood Countess of Translyvania get this book."
5,You have no Idea,"I had the incredable honor to be in 3 of Dr. Mcnally's Russian History courses at BC. He was my mentor and idol. I was very saddened at his recent demise.He is an A plus scholar and his historian the likes we'll never see again!Hey, Ray, this one's for you."

3,Okay for emergency power backup,"I'm not as impressed by this table lamp as others. For reading, it really isn't much better than a book light and is probably duller. Would work well in a power outage or outdoors in place of candles."
3,"purchased two, one poor manufacturing","On one of the two lamps purchased, the bulb retainer, a stamped metal part, will not thread on to the base needs to be taped on to make electrical contact."
2,not so great,"this lamp wasn't able to sufficiently ""night light"" a room in my house with no other light. i wanted it for the purpose of not falling getting up at night, but it really didn't help, and ate up batteries very quickly. i can't imagine it being any more helpful in a camping situation, and i have been a hiker/backpacker my whole life. i really don't know what it would be good for."
