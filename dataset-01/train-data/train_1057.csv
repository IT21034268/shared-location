4,back help,Purchased for my wife as a gift. Seems to work fine when she uses it at church services on Sunday.
3,Not for Short Torsos,The central/inner part of this support does not project forward enough to relieve lower back pain. Perhaps it's because I am short and the projection is located in the wrong place. It appears this product would benefit a taller person (or person with a longer torso) whose spine is curved higher on the body. I also removed the hard board that comes with the support and placed it upside down but to no avail the projection was still in the wrong place.
1,misfitting piece of garbage,"I read everyone's reviews, compared a number of models, and made the mistake of picking this option. It is WAY TOO BIG to reasonably use -- in any setting. I purchased it as a lumbar support but could not sit with it without having to lean back nearly six inches.Also -- BEWARE -- don't assume that if you dislike it you'll be able to just send it back. Amazon charages a restocking fee and the the cost of shipping is prohibitively high.Sorry guys, keep looking!"
3,Comfortable,"The back support promised is fine. It did not work in my car because the side flairs on the seat of my Taurus would not allow the support to sit flat. Therefore it stuck out way too far. However, my wife is using it in her reading chair and says it helps."
2,"Too hard, too cheap","The curve looks nice, but it's very stiff, no designed to change shape. A wood board is loosely inserted at the back, which makes it feel a little cheap."
2,Lower back Pain,I was very disappointed with the Duro-Med Relax A Back Pillow insert. It was too hard and stiff and the pillow was hard to keep in position. I unfortunately will be in the market for something softer and more comfortable. Maybe it will work better for someone else.
3,OK,"Ok, but not as firm as Back-Huggar. Nor is cover as high quality. It would be positively soft without the hardboard insert. Elastic strap isn't very useful."
1,Very uncomfortable and worthless,This is a second-grade product or it would be right to say its not even a product. After ordering I recieved it after 12 days and there was no tracking available. Cushion is very stiff even after talking out the back support out.This cushion intensified my back problem. It was very difficult to get this placed in correct posture.
2,Too thick,"This pad is not that great. I was looking for back support, but it pushes you forward so far that the rest of your back cannot rest on the seat. While it does leave your lower back supported, the top of your back can be overly stressed on long trips."
2,Too thick as a lumbar support,"The real item is much thicker than it looks on the website. After you put it into your chair, your back is very far from the back support.I regret that I bought this."
2,not for me,"I was looking forward to this, but I found that it pushed me too far forward and it made it almost uncomfortable on my back."
3,"Provides a lot of support, but can be too narrow","Bought this for a 800 mile road trip. It definitely provided more support than the bucket seats in my Ford Explorer (2005). I did not love the support because it was a bit too narrow for me. I am 6'1' and 215 lbs. Since the design wraps around the sides, it was fairly uncomfortable. If you are smaller it should provide you with good support."
4,Great product!,"I ordered this cushion for my executive type chair......I am only 5' and was sitting on the edge of my chair....this is just the right size to give support to my back and make it possible for me to sit back in the chair.....great value price wise as well. My chair has arms, but presented no problem positioning the cushion."
2,Duro-Med support cushion too severe,"This lumbar support cushion actually makes my back more uncomfortable. It seems too large for my frame and creates too severe a curve. It's also VERY firm and doesn't ""give"". If I hadn't thrown away the wrapper, I would have returned it."
4,Comfy but not perfect,"If you're tall, you might want to consider something else. I'm 6' and this thing doesn't really come far enough up my back to provide what I would call perfect support, but it's still better than the seats in my car which have very little lumbar support at all."
5,better than a chiropractor,"I have had lower back issues on and off for a few years. Visits to the chiropractor and special exercises mostly keep my back in good shape. However, this special pillow has been terrific in giving me just the support that I need. My husband ""borrowed"" it for a few evenings and ended up ordering one for himself. Now we have two great pillows with which to use while watching a little TV in the evenings. It gives just the right amount of support - not too much and not too little. And - the price is reasonable for the excellent quality."
1,slipping chair back support,"The chair back support could use verticle straps to keep it in place. With my desk chair, the chair back slips down into the space between the seat and back. Consequently, I keep having to pull it up into place. There is nothing unusual about my desk chair."
2,Not what I was looking for...,This didn't really work for me. I put it on the chair at my computer desk at work and it never stays in one place. Plus it just didn't give me the support I needed. Everybody's different though so just b/c it didn't work for me doesn't mean it won't work for you...
3,Far too big for use in a car bucket seat,"Far too big for use in a car bucket seat, but otherwise seemed nice enough. Had to return due to size."
4,back reliever,"I put this cushion on the back of my chair while I am doing homework on the computer, helps relieve the pain and stress."
3,Good for it's intended purpose.,"Worked well for back support, that's what counts of course but placement of tag did not allow it to be concealed while in the chair, looks bad in my living room chair."
2,Perhaps I expected too much.,"I purchased this for my office chair. All in all, I am disappointed. It felt good at first, but didn't stay put--kept sliding down. I stopped using it."
5,Amazon.com Lumbar Cushion -- Easily Worth the Price,"I love this cushion because it gives complete support for my back. The strap keeps it in place, even as I move practicing violin, and I never have to adjust it to the correct height, though the chair is wooden with varying slats on the back. It enables me to stay at any given task while sitting for much longer with no fatigue. I got one for my mother-in-law who is 89 and has collapsed disk disease and she loves it too, after trying a zillion other pillows. A big thumbs-up!"
4,Nice comfort for back,I like it. Serves the purpose at work. My work chair is uncomfortable and this helps the comfort level.
4,Lumbar support for the car,My husband used this on a recent road trip/vacation and continues to use it in his company van. He says it really helps and it is nicely made.
5,It Works!,"My wife asked me to order this in hopes it would relieve her stiff back. We watch TV nightly in recliners. I suspect the recliners do not provide proper back support, and this product does. Also, and importantly, the price is right to risk on a mail-order item."
2,don't like,"I don't like it, I bought it for back support and I find It is very uncomfortable to drive with."
3,NO BACK UP FOR ME,"It just didn""t fit my back, maybe because I'm overweight. I gave it away and have not heard anything from the person I gave it to."
4,Helps my posture a bit,I sit a lot for work and this thing helps me sit a bit straighter. Slouching caused some back issues so this a small price to pay for a healthier back.
3,hard to find in stores and good price,the user didn't find this as comfortable as the other lumbar support i had. perhaps to each his own. I purchased it for my crafters group.
3,Meh,"People were right, if you have those wings on the edges of your seat, this isn't going to fit nicely. Mine comes out so much that I lose the ability to lean back and feel the backrest of my chair. Also, the strap is way too short to fit around my car's seat. Will probably return."
2,Not very adjustable - downright uncomfortable.,"I tried this thing because I do have lower back issues. I tried it on my chair by the computer--no go, the wings on it made it a tough fit and uncomfortable as heck. I tried using it in the car--same story, those wings were too confining and it actually made matters worse... it was horrifically uncomfortable. I stuck it on a chair in the kitchen that I never use. I guess the only reason I didn't give it a 1 was that I acknowledge the possibility that for ""some"" people and on the ""right"" chair... it might provide some help. As for me, it was a waste of time and money."
3,Does the job--but prepare for a noticeably smaller seat,"I've been using this pillow for months now, and I have noticed that my back has been happier. The synthetic material smell only lasted a few weeks at most, and wasn't overwhelming in the first place. The elastic strap made it easy to add to my chair, and I rarely have to adjust it. That's the good news!The bad news is that this thing is pretty huge. That may work great for some folks; but after getting tired of being pushed toward the end of my seat, I've finally removed it. I like the support, but don't like the fact that it takes up so much of my chair. (My upper back was probably at least four inches away from my chair at all times.)This pillow definitely does the job; but I think I'll be shopping for a smaller pillow that just adds a little support to an otherwise adequately-shaped chair."
3,Comfy BUT STINKY!!!!,"This cushion offers great support for my back in my horrible office chair. However, when using it, it emits a horrible spray paint like smell. I hope this is just because it is fresh out of the packaging and the smell will diminish over time. But boy is it stinky, almost to the point of making me nauseated. I'm going to try slipping a few dryer sheets into the cover to see if that helps."
3,Too Hard,"For me this cushion was too hard and somewhat too big, tall. I'm 5'7. Also it takes up much of the seat so if you have a small seat, forget it, because then you will be sitting on the edge of your seat. I felt stiff in the back when using it and would of liked a softer make. The lumbar shape is good though. Great for a larger person."
5,backrest,The backboard provides extra support. It is one of the best sitting back supports I have had.
2,Not thick enough,"It is thinner in the middle than it looks in the picture. It might work for those who don't need a lot of support, but if you need a back support that really pushes back and doesn't give too much, this is not for you."
4,Eases Back ache,This reasonably priced pillow is just what I wanted for comfortable sitting in different types of chairs. It is easily transportable and easy to wash if necessary. My friend with a bad back said it helped support her back very comfortably as she sat and watched TV. Sometimes simple is the best.
4,Good product,"I use this back rest at work and it is comfortable. The only problem is that the elastic slips on my chair and I have had to tape it to keep it in place. Outside of that, it is just as good as the more expensive ones."
3,Good deal for the price,"Shipped on time, quality is good, good price, helps support but it's not deep enough when I have to sit up (typing, etc). I recommend it as it has helped over time."
4,"Comfortable, but not secure for my chair","This cushion is great for support in the lower back. However, if you plan on using it for a glossy finish wooden chair, don't. There is not enough traction on the elastic band for it to stay still, so it slides around a lot. I am sure it is perfect for cloth chairs, car seats, plastic chairs, etc. though."
3,Average,"I use this on my office chair at work due to lower back pain. It works ok. I wouldn't say I'm that much better off with it, but I also would say it was a waste of money. Look at other ones first."
4,very pleased,"Great price and provides the perfect amount of support. Was having back pain prior to the purchase due to not fitting in the chair I was given at work (lumbar support built in the chair didn't hit in the right spot). After using this for a few weeks, back pain is no longer a problem."
4,It feels so good!,"I originally bought this pillow for work. It feels tremendous in my office chair at work. I was so pleased with my first lumbar pillow that I bought a second one for home. It works great in my home office chair. And it works nicely in my recliner chair at home. It is not as comfortable using on the sofa, as in my desk chair at the computer, as the sofa isn't able to stabilize the pillow in place."
4,Should have bought this a year ago,At work I use a very nice office chair with arms but since I am short the arms prevent me from getting close enough to the desk to type comfortably. This cushion solved all my problems. It positions me correctly and provides excellent back support. Every now and then I have to remember to realign the cushion as it does slip a bit on the chair but I no longer ache at the end of the day.
2,"Too BIg, Heavy, Bulky for me","I received this as a gift. I tried it on my office chair and it is too big, forcing me to sit very uncomfortably. I'm hoping to return it and get a smaller half-roll pad instead."
2,Strap Is TOO SMALL!!,"This is a great lumbar support pillow. That being said, it is very poorly designed. It fits over chairs, etc. with a sturdy elastic band that only stretches about 6 inches!! I have a medium-size rocking chair that I couldn't get the elastic to stretch enough to fit over it...and it most definitely doesn't fit over my car seat, which is what I bought it for. It does fit on a couple of small chairs, but even if I wanted to use it on them, it won't stay ""up' but slides down to rest on the seat. I need it to be 4 or 5 inches above the seat. Velcro would be a much better choice to attach this item to a seat."
3,OK FOR THE HOME,BOUGHT THIS FOR THE CAR BUT WAY TOO BULKY TO FIT IN THE CAR.WORKS OK AT THE OFFICE CHAIR.
2,Depends on what you need it for,"I bought this to use in the car. It's really too big for the car. It has you sitting an easy 6 inches closer to the wheel or, right in another persons back if you are in the back of the car. Also there is a wood stabilizer in the back (removable where the zipper is) that floats around in there and is not secured. The piece of wood or particle board, hardens one sidde or the other making the cushion awkward and uncomfortable. I find myself adjusting it compulsively. Also the strap is not long enough to stretch around my car seat. Feels good when watching a movie, if you like to have perfect posture in the living room. I do like how the wings are long on each side. This feels like a hug, and in the car it keeps my torso from swaying with every turn."
2,Seat size may make it unsafe to drive,"The placement of the Bac prevents the safe operation of the vehicle by the operator. It forces your body forward into the steering wheel and changes the position of your foot to properly stop the vehicle. Returned item, paid $23.00 plus and received an EIGHT $$ credit. Must dispute credit card payment. The Bac does not fit all drivers seats for safety to the driver and passengers"
1,Hurts my back,This cushion is too short to be of any good. It hurts my back if I sit against it for more than a few minutes.I'm glad it costed only 10.00. I won't feel so angry when I toss it in the rubbish bin.Don't bother.. This cushion is painful..
4,Definitely helps with lower back pain,"It basically just forces you to sit more forward and more upright n your chair. This has certainly reduced (but not eliminated) my lower back pain. For the cost, though, I definitely recommend it."
5,This Product has Saved my Back!,"This is a fantastic product and a great value! I haven't had any problems with it fitting into both of our cars--a 2010 Nissan Altima and 2011 Suburu Forester. In the past year, I started a job where I drive up to 900 miles a week, and my back was in bad shape. This product has made a world of difference. I don't have the horrible pain that I had prior to its use. I have it in gray and think it looks very nice. It seems well-constructed and durable. I highly recommend the product!"
3,Lumbar chair support,"I recieved a similar item as a gift, and liked it enough to buy another. My back hurts less while at work."
1,Horrible! My kidneys hurt.,"The sides should have been much thinner. They press on my kidneys and after a couple of hours my kidneys start to hurt. Horrible ergonomics! Lumbar cushions are supposed to support your backbone, not your soft tissue."
2,Not so great,"Build quality is a little shoddy, and the strap is permanently stretched after a weeks worth of use.I'd recommend this one instead:Angel Sales PosturePro Lumbar Support. It's much more comfortable, and better made."
5,Service is super,Amazon is a wonderful place to buy online. Easy to move through the web cite. Good prices and super fast shipping plus help is with you immediately through their phone service. Will always use Amazon for my online purchasing.
1,not so good for me,"i was using it for my car, and its too big, plus it will not allow the heated seat to work"
2,"Hard, does not fit my frame","I am very petite (5'0"" and less than 100 lbs.) and this ""pillow"" did not hit my back in a comfortable spot at all. Also, it is harder than my actual chair, making it quite useless."
2,Did not meet the expectation,"I have been using this almost for a month in my office chair at work. I have purchased it to fix my posture due to heavy PC usage. We do have ergonomic chairs in the office maybe that is the reason why this didnt really fit well. First of all it requires the back part of the chair to be one piece all the way down to the seat. My chair has a small open area between the seat and the back part of the chair so the straps do not hold well. Second this is too thick and when i put this ,i do not have enough room for my legs on the seat. I feel like i am sitting half way in the chair. Again this all might be related with the type of chair i have but I thought this product would be one fit for all."
2,Not durable,"This pillow turned to foam powder after one year. Until then it was fine, but watch out for the mess when it falls apart and becomes dust."
4,Fine product,"This product is fine. However, if you're thin like me you may want a product that is fuller than this model. If I stick a thin tissue box behind the cushion, it is ideal, but then the tissue box gets squished, so I take it out and make due with the way the cushion is designed."
3,"Firm, but bulky","Echoing some other reviews here. I bought this for use in my car, but am finding it too large and bulky. Contrary to others, I found the fit to be perfect and really liked how firm it was. Definitely provides a lot of support. The major issue is just how large it is. My upper back is way too far away from the seat and I feel off balance sometimes. Adjusting it further up helps a little, but then it's not providing as much lower back support. Overall a good product, just more ideal for an office chair than a car."
2,Way too firm for my back problems,"Every back problem needs different types of support. I decided to give this a try and it was extremely uncomfortable for me as it was much too hard. I have upper thoracic and lower lumbar back problems. I need relief not a board.I recently bought another back pillow that worked great for me, but I decided to try this one. The one that worked for me is found on Amazon as well: AutoLogix 5834 Ortho Lumbar Wedge Seat Cushion."
2,Wings,"The cushion is pretty hard. The elastic band doesn't fit well around a large office chair. Also, the cushion has wings on the sides of the pillow that makes it hard to sit in a chair that has some contour of it's own. It doesn't work well for larger people since it is not as wide in the center (between the winged edges). I'm going to return it and get one without the angles of winged edges."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!,"How this back ""cushion"" has such high ratings is a mystery to me, it really is a poor product that is nothing as advertised. Rather than support my back, it gave me pain. I didn't even open the packaging and I could feel the cardboard as soon as I rested my back into it. You can also totally feel that piece of cardboard by just touching the back of it and the cardboard wasn't even set in place. Brought it to my car to give it a try and it totally didn't fit since the sides of the driver's seat is curved. Definitely not meant for the driver's or shotgun seat, maybe the back passenger seats. Either way, it is not a cushion in any way and absolutely does not provide any back support. You'll probably get more back pain than prevent it. Shipped it right back for a refund!"
3,You get what you pay for,I use it in my car. It helps support my lower back. I have to constantly adjust it but it serves its purpose
1,Hard as a brick,"Be warned this thing is as hard as a concrete slab, and the wings that so profusely jut out of the sides (not really represented in photos or description) don't help, maybe I've been too spoiled with Relax the Back tempurpedic products which cost 5x more, I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Dense foam stands up to everyday use.,"Very dense foam allows it to stand up to everyday use without condensing flat and taking away what it is supposed to do, support your lumbar. Cover is removable for washing, the strap is adequate, but a webbing strap an buckle would be a nice improvement."
1,Very hard and doesn't stay in place,"For someone who has chronic back pain, I am constanly searching for items that help alleviate my pain throughout my work day and this was not it."
3,Back chair support,"It's a little large for my office chair, so it does not allow me to sit all the way back in my chair. If it were a little less thick, I'm sure it would work better for me."
4,Nice,"Light pad, easy to carry around and very comfy in seats without lower back support. The straps are too small for some seats, especially automobiles but in the home its great."
3,Found to be just ok,Would not call it absolutely great. Just serves the purpose.Feel like it takes up too much space on the chair.
4,Good product,Nice and firm. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the elastic to go round the chair is too flimsy. It needs much stronger elastic to hold it in place on your chair so it doesn't slide down every time you get up.
2,not for me,"The material too hard, size too bulky. Not for me definitely.I'm not returning this only because I don't wanna spend the shipping fee for returning.I already paid for the shipping when it came to me )_:. Not worth it."
3,Sort of annoying but when it works it is good,"Bought this for work. The chair I have is an ergonomic chair and the pad fits it but within a few hours I am readjusting it again. Would like these pads to have a strong tie to them, add some velcro or something so that they don't slide so much. Comfortbale when things are all in place."
4,Good product,"i use this cushion almost everyday at work, and it definitely helps to make my back feel better. i'm 6 months pregnant and work in a call center, so i spend a lot of time sitting. i'm definitely glad i bought it!"
2,Duro-Med Relas a Bac Review,"It is attractive looking, however, it is too deep and pushes me out of my chair when I use it. It did support my low back a little bit, but the struggle to stay in my chair because of the depth of this cushion made me not use it and rate it 2 stars. The strap was barely long enough to fit around my larger chair and so I gave it only 2 stars."
5,Life Saver,Probably one of the best items I've ever bought in my life. I've had back problems for years and this thing does an excellent job. I travel A LOT due to work. After long trips I would exit the car unable to fully stretch my back from it being too stiff and had a bit of trouble walking. With this I can travel without any problems again. I make sure never to leave home without it.
3,Works on a Smaller Chair,"This back rest really does the trick when it comes to keeping your posture correct and taking pressure off your lumbar region. The only issue I had with it is that the elastic strap that holds it to the chair is not long enough to actually go around my office chair. I end up having to position it every time I sit down. If the back of your office chair is narrow, then this will work well. If it is wide, then try something different. I can't imagine it would fit around the seat of a car either."
5,The Best Hard Lumbar Spport Cushion,If you really want lumber support then this is the best one I've ever owned (it's my second one). Unlike memory foam lumbar supports that squish down after awhile this one will hold it's shape for years giving you real lumbar support.
3,Good for soft chairs and couches - not office chairs or car,"I was a little disappointed using this lumbar support pillow. It does make me sit up straighter and makes my back feel a little better when I use it on my couch which is relatively soft, but when I moved it to my office chair which is rather firm it felt like it was doing more harm than good."
3,Non adjustable strap is annoying,"The pillow has helped my back problems at the office for sure. However, I have to constantly put push it up to the correct position. The strap is not adjustable so the pillow keeps slipping down the chair."
4,Great back support,"I got this for my office chair. It feel great and the foam body is nice and firm. If my back bothers me, this always makes it feel better since it feels like its stretching my back as I sit straight. But the elastic strap doesn't stretch wide enough to fit around the back of my chair. It would have been nice if the elastic band was expandable, similar to how something like suspenders are expandable. So I have to tie it with some other string to make it stay in place, otherwise it keeps falling over and onto the floor every time I get up. But other than that, this product is great and I would highly recommend!"
4,Good item...but,I have a ruptured disc in my lower back so I bought this for obvious reasons. It works quite well and alleves the ache. ...but I bought it for in the car and the strap doesn't go around my seat. Too short! So I have it sitting there loose and it does move around a bit but is acceptable. I still am pleased with it.
4,Great Lumbar Support,"Duro-Med Relax-A-Bac Lumbar Cushion with Composite Board Insert and Strap, BurgundyI am very satisfied with this product. I purchased it after reading the reviews online at Amazon.com. I often telecommute and was having back pain due to the lack of lumbar support in my chair at home. Since getting my Duro-Med lumbar cushion, I am no longer having the back pain. I have really great support and can adjust the pillow to different positions as needed. I also love the Burgundy color. I highly recommend this cushion for anyone needing the extra back lumbar support."
3,Duro- Med was not right for me,This product's lumbar support hits too high in the back. It didn't help my low back pain. I ordered the Caarex Lumbar support and it is a huge improvemet over the Duro-Med product. The Carex is a more comfortable foam and much better quality than the Duro-Med. I purchased two more Carex lumbar suupports and am giving the Duro away.
3,"Ok, better than nothing",I purchased this pillow to use in the car because the manufactured car seats are not very comfortable. They caused backache. the pillow does help if you put it at the right position. But my husband said it hurts his back.
4,duro-med relax-abac with insert & strap,It is perfect for my Nisson SUB. The only problem for my scooter it pushes me forward & the seat is not deep enough for it. Amazon is a great provider of good handicapped products.
2,Uncomfortable,Had to return it. The sides dug into my back on a chair with some curvature. Might have been okay for a flat backed chair.
2,Kind of Annoying,Yes its soft and yes its good quality but I found it less comfortable to have something against my lower back when in my work chair. So now it just sits in the corner of my cube.
4,"Low cost, solid quality","I sit in front of a computer all day and I was getting lower back pain. Three months ago, my co-worker recommended this to me and to this date it still works great! Pain is gone. Highly recommended for anyone who does a lot of sitting. Only negative is that the strap only fits on certain types of chairs."
4,"Sciatica,Lumbago????",This item is specifically designed for the millions of us troubled with back pain. We have found that this provides that additional support to the lower back. It may not work for everyone but it has helped us.
5,Helped My Back Problems,"This product worked very well to alleviate my back pain. When sitting for long periods in the car or watching TV at night, I would many times wake up the next morning with severe back pain. Since I've used this product, I wake up with no pain. I bought 2 of them, one for the car and one for home. I haven't used the board insert included. The support is inexpensive and really helped, so I highly recommend this product."
2,Too big of a curve and hard. Hurts my back,"This is painful to sit with. It's kind of hard, and too curvy for my back. the edges flare out to kind of keep you in a pocket, and they're hard too. It's hard to see by the picture just how big supporting part is, would probably not have purchased it if I had seen it in a store."
2,Not really useful,"Have it on the back of my chair. Not really useful. I can't even feel it. You have to have a straight back chair for it to be even noticeable. Might work for you, but doesn't match well with my office depot leather exec chair."
4,excellent,"Got it because I am always sitting in car and my car seat isn't very comfortable, and needed more lumbar support. I didn't want to spend a ton of money, so I turned to Amazon. It was a perfect purchase, and couldn't be happier! Almost a day after using it, I could notice an improvement in my posture, and my back pain had vanished. I highly recommend this product!"
3,"Comfortable, but not good for compact cars.","This product was comfortable, but was not good for compact cars as it pushed me too close to the steering wheel and didn't fit the sit very well."
3,"Good at home, but not as comfy in the car","I bought this lumbar support pillow for use in my car after injuring my back & preparing for a long car ride for our vacationAlthough this pillow does, indeed, provide great support at home, it did not fit comfortably in my car seat. I drive a RAV 4 & the seats are contoured, which prevents the pillow from fitting flat against the seat backs.I will keep the pillow as it does provide support on my home chairs"
3,"It is built fine, but extremely hard and not suitable for a big guy","There is nothing wrong with the pillow per-se, but it is made of very hard foam. Since it's so hard, it is quite uncomfortable if you're big (it digs into my sides). I'm a 6' 2"" guy who's not exactly slender."
3,"Its okay, based on all the reviews, I was hoping for more","I ordered the gray pillow to blend with my gray office chair. In the product picture for gray, the fabric looked thick and that it would look inconspicuous in my office. The pillow is actually a light gray. The material looks more like the material for the black and burgundy pillow. Just something to think about if you are choosing the gray color. I also found that the pillow did not fit my office chair which was purchased from a big box office supply store. I used this pillow for 2 weeks but am done with it. It doesn't help my back at all."
3,Good in limited places,"I'll just repeat what others have said here. It's large and often doesn't fit with bucket style car seats. I have found it useful on my office chair at work, but not anywhere else."
2,"Nicely contoured, but stiff and cheaply constructed.","The contoured shape of this lumbar pillow is pretty good; however, I found the construction cheap and the stiff back prevented it from being used in any type of curved seat (car, high-back office chair) as it did not sit flush, sticking out quite a bit.If you intend to use this with some sort of flat backed chair then I would consider it; otherwise, the search continues."
3,Where does one use this?,"This is my second lumbar pillow. It's been awhile, but I could swear my first was smaller and softer. I couldn't figure out where to use this one b/c it's so big - it was pushing me off my desk chair and it didn't fit comfortably at all in my car, where I had intended to use it. I'm a small woman and wound up giving it to a very tall male friend who likes it better - he uses it at work and says it will be good for his old car, with the worn-out seats. I just found it too bulky to work well with seats that already have some side curvature inward."
4,Excellent support,This back rest works great for me and has eased a lot of my back pain; I can't sit comfortably without it anymore. I would like it better if it was taller but I usually just move it up depending on the chair i'm sitting in.
3,"Works, but too big",It has helped my back but doesn't fit in my car seat. My seat comes up and out at the sides and this is too wide to fit between that area. Otherwise I'd keep it.
3,Nice product,"The cushion gives nice support to the back, I would suggest a long strap that would allow the cushion to fit around an occasional living room chair. ."
4,Great back support!,Everyone should use one of these when sitting for a couple hours for so. I have another one purchased a couple of years ago. Will use it while sewing and on the pc.
2,Useless with office chairs,"I bought this to use with my office chair. To my disappointment, the cushion is so big that it takes up most of the seat! I'm forced to sit on the edge of my chair, which is very uncomfortable. I tried it on a couple other kinds of office chairs, and it was the same story each time.Maybe this cushion would work well if you have a chair with a fairly deep seat, so you can still sit back against the cushion. But for any of the fairly standard office chairs I tried it with, it was impossible to use!"
1,Terrible odor,"Actually, as a back support, I liked it. But, after a few days, I kept noticing this odor and it seemed to get worse, and left a bad taste in my mouth. Upon sniff'n the polyurethane pillow it was determined it was the culprit! I aired it out for 2 straight days outside but that only slightly helped. I washed it twice in the washing machine (""Delicate"") and dried it (""Delicate"" cycle) and then aired it out again overnight. NO GO!!! The frigg'n thing still has a bad odor (although less than at first) and it is going to find its new resting place in the dumpster today!"
1,Too Much Support,"Maybe my chair is not compatible but received this today and it's already in the trash. I found it very uncomfortable, almost like a soft knee in my back, and tried several adjustments. Even cut some of the foam out but it was still way too much. Now looking for something adjustable."
1,Very disappointed in this one!,"I rarely give an item a one star but this is cheap, not firm (which I want and need for good lumbar support), I returned the next day via Prime Membership here. It was awful. Sometimes you get a goodproduct at a bargain and sometimes what you pay for, this was the later......."
2,illustration is optical illusion,"This back cushion appeared to have the lumbar support that was mentioned in the description. Actually, it has ""flaps"" on either side but is flat in the middle---NO lumbar support. In my opinion this is not a quality product. I would not recommend it because it serves no purpose."
3,Doesn't fit me,"I'm a smaller lady, so maybe that's why it's so uncomfortable... But I don't use it anymore because it doesn't fit."
5,Good product,"I use this every day when I get home from work. It has a permanent spot on my recliner.I have had 4 back surgeries on my lower back, this helps to relieve pressure and curve my back in the right direction. It is very well made. It has access to remove cover to wash if needed and I use mine without the masonite insert, giving it a more comfortable feel. No complaints at all."
3,The strap is almost useless,"For the price you would think the strap would be velcro but its not at all.. good luck getting it around any sizeable chair.. if yours is a small chair then as long as the arm rests are not in the way it should work.. anything else and its just crazy, the strap pulls on both sides of the fabric and looks like it will eventually pop right off."
3,Be advised,"Uncomfortable, bulky, shabby manufacturing. I would advise more shopping and paying more for a better, ""does what it says on the tin"" product."
3,Its Good . . . . I think,"So when I first got this i was super excited because I have a bad back, and in addition my car is not the most comfortable place to be in for the long commute to work. Well needless to say the first two days were Great, my back felt good, and I was very excited about this purchase. However, after a week of having it in the car my back starting getting very uncomfortable, and I kept shuffling around thinking that maybe i was just sitting in the wrong position. Unfortunately, this was not the case and so since then i have taken it out of my car and brought it into my office. Its working OK now, but to be honest sometimes i feel pain just sitting in it. I'm not sure if thats because its working and I just have a bad back, or if its because its a piece of junk."
2,Might work in the right chair,"I found the brace to be too large to be comfortable. It would not ""sink"" into any seat that I sat into except the couch. It helped a little and was inexpensive so it may be worth trying for the money. But it did not work for me. It would work better if it was a few inches shorter and acted primarily as a lumbar support."
4,Celtic craft sourcebook,"This book had a wide variety of designs, printed as promised, on sturdy paper. In fact one of its best points is the same reason I penalize it a star, is the intricacy of the designs. The intricacy is also wonderful, since most stencils tend to give up detail in order to make the stencil simpler to make. The problem here is that you have to cut the stencils out yourself. Now because of the very intricacy, there are a LOT of tiny holes you have to cut out. By the time you get done, or at least by the time I get done, the paper is not quite so sturdy as it was. And it took quite some time to do. I recomend a sharp pair of small embroidery scissors to do it."
2,Not an easy stencil,"This book has beautiful pictures but it would be very labor intensive to use them as stencils, which is WHY i bought it."
1,How to Start and Manage a Nursing Home Care Business,"Too basic and not specific to the topic. Too general. It seems the author took a template and pluged in ""nusring home business"" where necessary."
2,Water dispenser,"The dispenser, is very very small, I ordered it for bday party, once I took it out of the box, I was very disappointed, not recommend for party's. very disappointed."
5,"Not Little Songs, but still a stand out","David Usher's second go at a solo album is a little more mainstream. BUT, due to Usher's skills at songwriting and appearances by his Moist bandmates and Jeff Martin of Tea Party (to name a few) it's unique and original. It is definitely different from Little Songs, Usher's first solo album, which was purely acoustic and a great album because of one song--St. Lawrence River...gorgeous!! But it has yet to leave my player since I bought it on my trip to Canada, and that is a huge rave being that I tire of CDs easily.It's worth more than passing listen...and worth the import price."
4,Fruit Slices,"The fruit slices arrived after the estimated delivery date, but were exactly what I needed. I'm placing them on top of cupcakes for a bridal shower (lemon- lime themed). They seem very fresh and look fantastic!"
2,seem to be old stock...,"The items seem to be old stocks..??! If I'll be sending these items as gifts, they could say that these are imitations and/or old stocks already. How do we prevent these scenarios? Are these products really old stocks and/or original/brandnew?"
4,Time,"It took a bit too long for me to get it, I was expecting it before. The product was in perfect conditions - Overall everything was okay"
5,Excelente,todo llego en muy buen estado me encanta ... lo recomiendo 100% la entrega fue en el tiempo estimado tal como lo esperaba no tuve ningún problema gracias
5,The best entertaining DVD,This was the most wonderful series of many a year. The whole family can enjoy the great acting and the senery of Australia and Rome were Magnificent. I will watch this series many times over.
1,This film is pathetic,"I LOVE RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN, but this film is horrible!! I don't know how I could spend my money on this!"
1,The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years,"I am speaking only of the TV movie. It was awful!! Without Rachel Ward, it rated a big ZERO. Father Ralph died in the 4th video, so having him appear again was absurd. Whoever played Meggie could not even begin to hold a candle to Rachael Ward, so the entire movie was, to me, a big flop. The original was just wonderful & you are right. They should have left the movie & the music alone."
1,"Decent attempt, should have left it.","Sad how the original composer Henry Mancini had passed on earlier before this film was made. Unfortunately they should have left both the movie, and the music alone. Not only was the music tampered with due to the fact that a new composer was needed, but they shouldn't have tampered with the original scores, and as for the movie it was just completely off track from the actual storyline and original miniseries.An interesting movie to watch for pure amusement to how they altered it, but the cd just isn't the same with original scores altered."
3,So-so,"Thorn Birds fans will have mixed feelings on this one. It sorely misses Rachel Ward, although Amanda Donohoe does a fine job of acting, it just doesn't seem like ""Meggie"". The chemistry isn't the same between Meggie and Ralph. It is interesting to see the fill-in for those missing years, but a couple of things don't add up (hmmmm....thought Meggie said she hadn't gone back to Luke after that month with Ralph). Overall, I would say it's an okay movie and parts of it will bring back that ""Thorn Birds"" feeling, but nothing like the original miniseries (but then, how can you match up to that?). If you've not seen it, you might want to rent it, but not sure if it's worth buying."
3,ok but,It was good but was disappointed to find the sequels to this was not on amazon. I would wait to view until the the other parts to this series become available.
2,Did they watch the first one?,"Fee in the original (played painfully brilliant by Jean Simmons) was not religious. In the ""Missing Years"" disaster, most of her lines are about God. Did that bother anyone else?Also, I'm sure they went through hundreds of boys to portray young Dane. A red head???? He looked nothing like the Dane in the original. Luke at least tried to express himself as Bryan Brown did but Meggie??? She just did her own thing.Rachel Ward has a very distinctive voice. It's called acting. If you can't portray someone who was so vividly remembered, then you didnt succeed in making the audience feel they were really watching the missing years."
5,enjoyable,"I found The Missing Years to be surprisingly entertaining. It doesn't exactly fit the continuity of the original, but I'm a soap opera fan who is used to that sort of thing. Many Thorn Bird fans will not be pleased by The Missing Years, but I just can't help liking it as enjoyable escapism. Chamberlain is once again delightful as Father Ralph. Father Ralph's role in dealing with the Holocaust had me cheering. The fight scene made me cheering too! I'm a sucker for the love story between Ralph and Meggie too. Missing Years is flawed, but it is fun. And there is one scene that moved me very deeply. I found it a little more satisfying than the first in that respect."
1,Terrible Movie,This was the absolutely worst movie I have ever seen. The only original character acting in this movie is Richard Chamberlain. I don't know how it was ever released.
3,Worth the effort,"This book is about a the life of a young Japanese boy. Orphaned at a very young age he has to learn how to survive without any family or any kind of support. Although this book does get a little boring at some parts, it's pretty exciting and worth reading."
5,Amazing!,"Hi,This book is about a boy named Saru who is orphaned at a young age. He learns to survive with a priest. He deals with robber gangs and powerful samurais. One day he meets a samurai who wants to rescue his wife from another powerful samurai. So they two men journey off together to find the wife. But their future...they do not know.I think this book was really good. Very detailed and exciting events. A definite 5 star!"
4,The Boy And The Samurai,"In the book, The Boy And The Samurai, there are 6 surprising events. One of them is that almost instantly; he becomes an orphan twice when both his real parents and foster parents died. Another is when he survives one of the harshest winters with barely any warmth or food while raising a cat. He also stops a gang of children from robbing an inn. These are some reasons why the events in The Boy And The Samurai is interesting and surprising."
3,Distance Spot...,"Finally, found what i was looking for... The Distance:Spot is 9:1. Every 9"" of distance away, it's reading a spot 1"" wide. Other's I've found have a 12:1 or even 16:1"
3,Maverick Laser Surface Thermometer,The Maverick Surface Thermometer is a great gadget. The thermometer tops out at 700 degrees. A good steak house cooks steaks at 1800 to seal the juices in the steak to perfect it. I hoped this would have had a greater temperature accuracy range.
2,Maverick: short-lived,"Purchased the Maverick Laser Surface Thermometer to chart water temperatures for a residential ""pump and dump"" Water Furnace heat pump. It worked fine for about five months, then started showing obviously erroneous readings. Changed to new batteries, but no improvement. This gadget has never been dropped, exposed to extreme temperatures, or abused in any way. The 90-day warranty is past, so no help there."
5,awesome!,A ton of uses. I bought this for my grill. Very useful and accurate. A must have in the kitchen.
4,IR thermometer,The product seems to work very satisfactorily for taking temperatures of various items from varying distances and seems to be very accurate. So far my wife just loves using it and it helps her very much in her daily cooking and baking.
4,Johnny's last album as a leader,"The version of ""Echoes Of Harlem"" is worth the price of the C.D. His solos are the highest standard of blues saxophone, and Oliver Nelson re-arranges several classic Ellington pieces, as well as some original compositions. The orchestra is loaded with all-stars including Snooky Young, Randy Brecker, Al Grey, Frank Wess, Joe Farrell, Hank Jones, Earl Hines, and Ron Carter. Hodges died 2 months after this date in 1970. I used to own the L.P., and was thrilled to locate it at Amazon.com ."
1,Highcard,One of the worst board games I've ever played. Didn't even want to finish the first game we played after opening the box. All luck no skill involve game is cheaply made all the way around.
4,"Gone, but not forgotten!","This is a very good album. I bought it many years ago, right after it was released. I've listened to it many times over the years and have never grown tired of it. Of course, having Jackson Browne accompanying Clarence on some songs certainly doesn't hurt. If Springsteen is the heart of Bruce Springsteen and the E - Street Band, Clarence was the soul of the band. Of all the talent in the E - Street Band, Clarence and Nils Lofgren are the standout individual talents."
5,I Wanna Do It!,"I belong to a musical society (I recently played Mack in Mack & Mabel) so I'm always on the look out for shows I've never heard of. I read the review for this one and after seeing that Susan Egan was in it (who I loved in Beauty & The Beast, Hercules) I couldn't resist. WHAT A FIND! I LOVE this show! It's so witty and clever with some absolutely gorgeous melodies. I'm going to suggest doing it for a production next year...so I hope the amateur rights are available. If you love great musicals in the tradition of 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' then buy this - you won't be disappointed."
5,a beautiful recording,"I bought this c.d. on the basis of the other reviews and have to agree: This score is TERRIFIC, without even one inferior song. Absolute delightful! It's humorous, charming and lovely and these performers sing it beautifully, plus the added dialogue allows you to easily follow the story. A real winner!!"
3,CD Single,This CD was not a remix or long playing version which most singles are. Disappointed because the playing time was not shown prior to my purchase.
3,this Colab worked,"back when this cut dropped this Jam was banging at my local club.sampling&Looping People is tricky business,especially when you bring in Marvin Gaye's voice.this song works really well with Erick Sermon guding the track&Marvin Gaye's voice used really well. the video went well as well.this was a pretty catchy cut."
4,Great Memoir,"It happens more often then we'd like to imagine and it's a parents night-mare, but many young boys fall prety to older men and it sticks! This is the story of one ball who is seduced by a camp counselor, but the boy himself becomes gay and later-on confronts his abuser. Good book with a lot of humor and insight."
1,Worked once,"Got it as a gift and really had to play with it to get it to work. Finally got some fairly good readings. Put it away, and the next time the batteries were dead. So much for the auto shut off feature. Put new batteries in it and really had to play with it to get it to work. Never got a consistent reading. This time I took the batteries out afterward. What a hassle. Didn't matter, next time I couldn't get it to work at all. Gave it one star because the site would not let me give it none."
1,"no more records, please!","This album is honestly poor...there is only a song (tre parole) that had a really unbelieveble success and I frankly don't know why, 'cause if you listen to the text you'll find it completely idiot. The rest of the cd is not to mention."
3,Good summary for using XML in Microsoft environment,"But we are working in a mixed environment, so this book was definitely not a be-all-end-all.The initial (pre-printing) review gave me hope that the information on using XML with MS products would be primarily augmention, but the actual orientation of the book is rather that of preparing engineers with MS experience to use XML with the tools that they have.Note that many of the code examples use VB.I would suggest this book as a starting point for MS experienced engineers adding a few XML capabilities to existing databases."
2,No details on NATIVE XML DBs???,"Interesting that you basically ignore native XML DBs. They are the definitive choice in most XML Document Centric environments. While RDBs remain quite strong in XML Data Centric models, they must resort to BLOBs or risk an order of magnitude of sluggishness compared to native XML DBs, such as our GoXML DB. Even with BLOBs, you cannot create a new document from multiple existing documents because of the columnar structure. The lack of a full table of contents when your title is 'Professional XML Databases' is disappointing...Concerned XML Enthusiast"
5,"Thank you, Ms Haydon!","I waited for two years for this book, and it was well worth the wait. This is a remarkable series with fascinating depth, great characters who grow and change as they experience events, and a story that twists and turns and is never predictable. Great battle scenes that don't drag on forever, poignant moments juxtaposed with baldly funny ones. What more could you wask than that? Thank you, Ms. Haydon, for a wonderful read and a memorable trilogy.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, and anyone who has never read it before. It is accessible and interesting.Finally I'd like to say that coronate is certainly a VERB, from the Latin coronatus, past participle of coronare, meaning to crown, from ""corona."" Ms. Haydon's use of language is far more intelligent and certainly more correct than that of pompous amateur reviewers who seem to enjoy putting books down even as they praise them."
5,"Destiny: An epic saga of love, revenge and power","In the last year I've read over 40 Fantasy titles in my free time. The Symphony of Ages is the most pleasurable reading I've picked up since David Gemmell's ""White Wolf"".After defeating the Shing and Rhakshas, Rhapsody,Achmed, Grunthor, and Ashe still have on final task to peform in order to fulfill the prophecy of the 3 and bring peace to the land of Roland: Find and kill the F'dor!Pursued by enemies and with her friends at each others throats, Rhapsody is forced to take much of the battle on to herself in a final showdown where she must confront her greatest enemy and her worst fear.I couldn't put this book down, if you loved the other two then this is a must read."
4,Destiny,"Book arrived in very good condition. Haven't gotten to it reading wise, going through the whole series. Happy with my purchase."
3,"Not bad, but too long","I enjoyed these books, but I didn't think they were anything special. Throughout the course of the three books I thought that Haydon just kept giving Rhapsody new powers to further the story line. And everything that happens seems to be a little too convenient. The books were ok, but nothing special."
3,More Fairy Tale than Fantasy,"Once you get past the male-bashing and the ""Pretty Woman"" Fairy tale its not too bad of a story. The story is very complex which I like but there is too much detail. For example I don't need to know the name of every tree in the forest or every herb on a healers shelf. Also wasn't it Achmed that invented the Cwellan and not Gwyilliam (that sentence confused me in the last battle scene.)The other problem I had with this trilogy was that there was too much dialogue and too few battles. In the third book it wasn't until the middle that I saw any action."
3,A Home Run..If only,"The first two books of this series were an incredible read, a true all night page turner! The characters are a wonderful patchwork of personalities that meshed together to create a well rounded storyline and a unique world. Unfortunatly the (beaten over the head) plot device went one book (maybe even just half a book) too far in this readers opinion. Perhaps I have just read one too many stories where the real plot disolves into a new/old one based around a romantic relationship that keeps dragging out across an entire series (I must thank Terry Goodkind for souring me on this plot device). On the brighter side of things I found Rhaps to be a truly endeering character with an inner warmth and depth that shined brightly even through the adverse and tragic advents that surrounded her life."
2,I don't know why I bothered,"The only reason I finsihed this trilogy is that I'd allready bought the book and hate to leave things unfinished. The ending to the symphony of ages can be predicted if you read the first book. All good things come to Rhapsody (and i do mean all good things-its stupid that she become queen of that many people so fast) and Ashe. This book is predictable, boring, and written like an outline despite its eminse length. This is not a good epic fantasy, its a bad, long winded, mary sue-ish fanfiction type story. You get the feeling this story was the authors fantsay for years and she had to write it down and publish it. I'm not going to even bother with the next trilogy by this author.If you like the general tone of these books, try Dawn Cook's Truth series for something better."
3,Disappointing,"Confusing beginning with far too much backstory and too many characters without distinguishing characteristics. It got a little better past page 100, (maybe I learned to skip those parts). The structure of the conclusion was good, and the pace kept your attention, but it got a little too simperingly sweet at times. Rhapsody timewarped back to being a 1950's housewifely heroine and had recurring self esteem problems that were simplistic and boring. It's worth reading because the ending fits well with the rest of the story, but I'm disappointed that the characters didn't develop the more complex depth that seemed to be promised in the other two volumes."
2,I finally finished it!,"After more than TWO weeks of tedious reading, I was finallly able to finish this most boring book of a not-that-good series. The caracters are over-devolep (if such a thing is possible), the story has so many gasp you can't really make any sense out of it and the story telling is so un-compelling that I don't really understand why anyone should really like this book. If you want great fantasy reading, try George, RR Martin, or the new novels of those great author: Weis and Hickman, or even Robbin Hobb, but don't bother with these series.I just wanted to state my opinion, given the absurd number of stars people were granting these books. (Specially this last one, the worst by far)"
5,Destiny,THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK. I absolutely loved this book and the rest of the series. The characters come to life as you read and every page is gripping. Loved the story and you will too. Read it!!
1,Pretty Dumb,"I kept putting the book down because the story was so boring and stupid! I finally finished it, though, after getting stuck in an airport.This started out as a good series, but this book is terrible. Everthing is so staged. The author tries to create suspense but the plot is boring, shaky and incredibly predictable.This book might be good for young teens, girls especially. This doesn't come close in any way to the great George Martin books. I'd leave Rhapsody on the shelf if I were you."
2,Achmed,"i am also an achmed fan, and i was hoping that in the final book tehre wuld be something between rhapsody and achmed, and i was going to read it. But now i find that, well what i wanted didnt happen. I was really hoping that ashe would be killed off (i absolutly loathed his character, i found him to be uncomfortable to read about, and he wasnt as strong a character at Achmed, and he wasnt around for a long time. Im sorely dissapointed that non of what i wanted happened, but i found the first book to be one of the best ive ever read (the second one introduced , ok well brought back ashe, and he stole the limelight from the three friends. that peeved me to no end, i actually was glad in the beginning that the horney teenager was gone and back to him own time...hmmm i guess im just a fan that was upset....) and anyone out there thinking that you shouldnt read it, go on and read it, its very entertaining, im just spoilt and wanted achmed to get the chick!"
2,A disappointing finale,"Despite the quality and ingenuity of the two novels that preceded this one, Destiny: Child of Sky definitely did not fulfill the promise of the trilogy. Too often, the progress of this book was impeded by irrelevant and unnecessary attention to the romance between Ashe and Rhapsody to the point where the reader was left wondering if in fact he had picked up a romance novel and not a book of the fantasy genre. In addition, the writer seems to go out of her way to create a mythic figure of Rhapsody, rhapsodizing (no pun intended) on and on about her multitude of virtues. For her to be the most beautiful creature in the world, the crowned queen of the Lirin and the Lady Cymrian seems to be pushing even the limits of fantasy. In my opinion, it would have helped if she had been written as a more realistic character. I agree that Miss Haydon does have much promise but this novel definitely does not evidence it."
2,good... if you're looking for a romance novel.,"I orginally picked up this series because I thought it was fantasy, with a little bit of a love story thrown in. Turns out, it's a romance novel with a fantasy setting. I despise the 'perfection' of the main character, as well as Ashe's (and everyone else's) obsession for her. I find Rhapsody's perfection only to be evident in that the author tells us it is so, rather than Rhapsody's actions. She is quick tempered and judgemental, and feels she is always justified in her opinions and actions.It's a shame that the series ended up like this. I enjoyed the first book enough to buy the next two books at the same time. I didn't expect the plot to be overshadowed by Rhapsody's rather obnoxious relationship."
3,A relief to see an ending,"..sort of, since there's a follow-on series coming up. Destiny is actually the best-written of the 3 books in this series, and therefore less hard-going than the others.Unfortunately, the idea of Ms Incredibly Immortal, Perfect And Powerful doesn't gel with me. I want my heroines to be somewhat human and there was no need to place Rhapsody on such a high pedestal."
3,Disappointing Destiny,"Elizabeth Haydon is a fine writer, but I believe this series devolved from a excellent fantasy series to an excellent romance series over the course of three novels. The most interesting character in the series, Achmed, in Destiny becomes one more wistful pathetic suitor of Rhapsody's perfection. Ashe and Rhapsody are shining Barbie and Ken dolls and I'm sorry, but I prefer characters with a few warts. With most other characters feeling an urge to genuflect and turn them in to royalty a certain tension is lost.A basic disconnect sets in for me when a good gritty story becomes an inevitable fairy tale march to coronation and although I was genuinely interested in the series I found Destiny hard to finish.It's a promosing beginning for this writer and as romance is quite popular I'm sure Ms. Haydon will continue to have an enthusiastic following, but I will not likely be one of them."
3,Accent Difficulties,"I love this company's products and use many at the preschool where I teach. This particular game was not quite what I'd anticipated, though. The speakers on the CD recording have rather thick British accents, which is fine, but this made it difficult for my students to understand."
2,ego is not a dirty word,"cd left off songs from the original LP. what a rip off. mainly, ""you only like me cuss i'm good in bed."" great song!"
3,They match but be careful of color!,"Although these are seriously gorgeous, you have to be careful of washing these. The instructions do state that they are not dishwasher safe, but the paint will even come off when hand washing. We ended up using cold water and no soap to clean because after the first use, the paint was coming off. Therefore, these will be used only on holidays and not during the whole season, like I like to use the rest of my matching dinnerware.Very thin and delicate.Otherwise, they match the dinnerware perfectly."
1,Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Glasses (Wine & Coolers) from Kohl's or Penneys,"Not Penney's or Kohl's fault. These glasses are so elegant.....when you see them in the store. As I washed them for the first time yesterday, every berry and all the red around the stem of the wine glasses and the bottoms of the coolers began to flake off. Even with a receipt and although they've never been used, I'm stuck with trashed up ""elegant"" glasses. Penney's & Kohls no longer carry these two different sets of glasses. Makes one wonder why!"
1,"Lovely, but not durable","Sorry, but lovely as they are, these glasses are far too fragile to be of any use. We have a dozen of these and only use them for 2 or 3 meals at Christmas each year. The glasses are only handwashed, and never go in the dishwasher. After 2 seasons, almost all have the red paint flaking off. After the first Christmas (only 3 washings) a few were flaking already. Thinking these were defective, we bought an additional set of 4. Now, after another Christmas and 2 more washings, even those are flaking. Glassware, no matter how special, should be able to be handwashed more than 3 times."
1,"Beautiful, but paint peels","I have 3 sets of these glasses. As per the instructions, I have only hand-washed them with mild soap and a soft sponge. Despite the care taken to wash them properly, every glass has chips in the paint at the bottom. On one, every bit of red paint is completely gone. I have contacted Pfaltzgraff about the problem, and have not received ANY communication back from them. So, while the glasses are beautiful, don't waste your money. The paint will chip and the company won't do anything about it."
1,Worst purchase ever made.,Pfaitzgraff Winterberry 20-oz glasses.I can't believe that Pfaltzgraff would put something as bed as these glasses on the market. All of the decorated design came off under running water!
3,Very beautiful but,"I bought three sets of these glasses last year. Even though I hand-washed them, the red coloring on the bottom of one of the glasses peeled off in my dish water. So far the others seem OK, but I wonder if and when the others will start to peel, too.Pfaltzgraff Winterberry 20-Ounce Coolers, Set of 4"
5,Beyond the Physical,"I haven't worked out in years and have never really been into yoga- maybe once or twice. While I couldn't come close to doing a lot of these exercises, I didn't feel discouraged, I felt more inspired. They were really good about giving people alternative suggestions/modifications. I really liked integrating the chakras as that is something that I do have experience in. I think that this video is one that I can work with without being discouraged. It will take me awhile to get there but I could see this routing being sustainable for the long term vs. a ""beginner"" only video."
5,HEE-HOO-HEE-HOO,"Gotta love Ana and Ravi. It seems like they're in the room with you, they are in a fantastic white room--not a cheesy landscape. The flow eventually mangles each nerve ending in your body, feeling super charged after the practice. A deeply restorative, relaxing video with a bit of a workout for your diaphragm. Let your aurora be cleansed, namas-te."
2,misguided,"When I read the reviews for this, no one bothered to mention that its all breathing exercises. If you're looking for yoga poses, this is not for you."
3,"Excellent yoga, Terrible dvd","I love these yoga DVDs with Ana and Ravi. Normally I would have given every star I could and then some because my day just doesn't seem complete without my Kundalini yoga fix. This DVD is the 10th (and 11th) in my collection. Two brand new, cellophaned dvds and neither of them will play all the way thru. I am very, very disappointed.So, my review isn't so much towards the content of this dvd since I can't do it. My other Kundalini yoga DVDs are awesome. There must be something about this batch? So disappointed. :("
2,Excellent instruction-Poor quality DVD,"Very good content, very poor video quality. Jerks, delays and extraneous pixel-boxes throughout. Luckily I can do most of this by listening. I don't think I will by more for a while. My DVD player works fine on all my other DVD's. It is unfortunate."
1,BAD yoga. BORRING,At first I thought this was just warm up.. but no save your money and buy ten minute yoga solutions.
5,Thanks to Ana & Ravi for making this practice so widely available,"I can't explain the Chakras better then the reviewers who already have so I will review the other aspects. This is a first rate production: Great music, perfect instruction, beautiful demonstration by Ana, enough challenging poses for those who are intermediate to advanced yet great for beginners too. A wonderful tool to grow into your practice.I will also say I have been doing Yoga for five years and this workout works out areas of my body I never knew I had!Of Course, there is throughout, loads of information about the fascinating chakra subject. I have had lots of fun figuring out my blocks (but I'll never tell!)Would recommend to everyone and anyone."
5,If you really want to get in touch with kundalini energy this DVD is it!,"I was really surprised with how I felt after finishing this DVD for the first time--my mind felt clear and balanced. I was having some difficulties before with visualizing my 6th and 7th chakra colors, but after doing this workout twice I don't have that issue anymore. This is a really wonderful approach to balancing chakras and your life. In comparison to some other Ravi and Ana's DVD's that I have I would say this one has a moderate level of physical activity and more complex breathing and energy moving exercises then other newer DVD's that they have. Even though it is one of their earlier DVD's--it is certainly a ""must have"". I absolutely love it!!"
3,Looking forward to this game - No online fee!,"I am personally looking forward to this game. I have played previous Resident Evil games, and this one promises and looks to be alot better that the most recent games.I don't know where people are getting the idea of an online fee, but if you go to Capcom website for this game in the Q&A; section, it says there will be NO added fee for online play. And that is the main reason I am looking forward to this game and not other online games that do charge a monthly service online fee.According to Capcom's website, there will be no fee for online play."
2,Disappointing,"I had heard negative things about this game, so luckily I rented it before I bought it. I have played all the Resident Evils, and this is the only one I was not happy with. FYI, I did not play the game online, so my comments are only from a single-player point of view.The vibe of this game just isn't the same. The zombies aren't particularly scary, just rather annoying.I also hate having other people following me around. They get in my way, and I am responsible for their well-being. I'd rather just look after myself.The biggest downside for me was the length of time between scenes loading. It takes a ridiculously long time just to load a single room. Once you leave that room, the previous area has to be loaded again as well.Overall, this game just wasn't worth it. I can't imagine having the patience for the loading times whether or not I was online. That alone would discourage me from playing."
4,This Game Is Good.,"This game is good it's not the best but it sure can be scarey and fun, Pick from 8 charactear's with each of there own special action's and personal item (and some charactear's to unlock) Go online in a world of dead walking and try to get you're self and you're team mate's out of the mess, Up to 4 player's for one game. There is so many thing's you can do like give a item to one of your team mate's pick em up from the floor when they are weak and hurted and more!. I hope you really enjoy this game as well as i do.. And it's not hard to play i'm really good at this game and you will to. =^-^="
3,Not yet Played.,"Im a fan of RE. Maybe everybody that reads this, is a fan. Well, The Graphics don't impress me. The gameplay from what I have read seems to be cool. But one thing, if is an online game, WHY can't we talk to our buddys?? It would be SOOO cool if we could talk to each other, at least CHAT!! that is one of the greatest things of online play, people CAN talk!I hate when you have to pay for online gaming, that is why i dont have Xbox Live. Most PC games are FREE for online playing (all you need is internet) I refuse to pay 60 USD for 1year of Live. That is more of a reapoff!! I also hate to buy a broadband adapter that costs 40 USD for the PS2. I only preorder this game because my friend has an adapter that he doesn't use and he will let me borrow it. But the game should sell for 60 USD with the adapter included."
4,BEST GAME OF THE YEAR,alot of dispuit is coming from buyers about the headset in this game.. but without the headset it brings the game a all new sense of fear and realism.. this is considerablly the best online game this year!!!! o and im 16 lol
2,This game is weak,"I found R.E.Outbreak to be a very weak game. For starters, the loading time on this game [irritates]. Which is a big thing for me. Also it only took me a day to beat it. I mean, wheres the fun in that. Right? Also the game movement is very slow. Suggestion,rent it, dont buy it. Hope this helps."
4,resident evil (no way on online pay),"Yes i love resident evil im probably one of the greatest fans on the game,but im not going to pay to play online if ive already paid for the game.THATS CRAZY"
4,This does not require an online fee!!,"Someone mentioned this game wasn't worth the price because of an online fee. Well, if they actually purchased and played the game they would know that there is no online fee. The only requirements is a PS2 Network adapter and a Broadband connection.I bought this game a couple days ago and I've been playing online since I purchased it. It really is a good online experience but if you will not be able to play it online I would say it is only a rental."
4,Old but...,This is an old book since I purchased it in Sept 2011 but not much has changed building console and forms apps so it worked just fine. Sometimes its useful to have a book to look things up but most likely everything in this book is available on MSDN.
5,A MUST READ for any serious C# developer,"I am a long time windows developer going back to version 2.03 and plain old C. This book is simply packed with insight and clearly explained, well articulated Know-how!! It is not, like so many others are, a refactoring of the documentation. The author, Chris Sells, gives you his direct understanding of WinForms and C#. If you are just learning Win Forms, I believe strongly that you are far better served with this book than you would be with something like Petzold's. As much as I owe to Petzold's teachings over the years, I sure wish books like this had existed when I was learning Windows. If you are a journeyman, hardcore developer as I suppose I am, you will appreciate Chris's insights and delivery style even more than the novice. All of the books in this series are at the top of the field and this effort is certainly no exception. I think you will learn far faster, and have much more fun with this text!"
1,"Would have written my own review, but...","""...I had hoped it would be a convenient and quick reference to such questions as ""how do I use FolderBrowserDialog and/or OpenFileDialog to open a file in my C# program?"" but although these standard components are indexed in the book the discussion of them in the book is shorter than this review I am writing. What I would want is some kind of sample code, maybe a step-by-step description of how to add the components to my program...""There's no way I could have said it better. The book seems to want to cover ""everything"" but actually manages to say ""nothing"".The only part in which I would have to disagree with the previous reviewer is his rating. He gave it three stars. I think it deserves one."
2,Too simple,"Worst book ever from Chris Sells. No real explaination, touch and go...this book should named How to use C# with VS.NET instead."
2,A lot of staff and a little of substance,"This book covers a lot of topics from how to create a rectangle to custom controls to XML and resources. I primarily bought this book to understand how to manipulate windows user interface on the control level. Unfortunately book doesn't provide enough information about exposed methods of controls and doesn't tell you how to override their behavior. The examples given in the book are very short and do not allow you to see the full workings of the class or method being described.This book has a lot of 5 star reviews. This was the reason why I bought it, so may be there is something there for you, but I'm talking it back to amazon and hope to get something better for my purpose."
5,Highly recommended,"Windows Forms Programming in C# is a well written Windows Forms tutorial. Chris thoroughly and exhaustively examines different facets of Windows Forms programming. I picked up this book after programming Windows Forms for 3 years, and I did have a lot to learn from Mr. Sells. This book has been adopted for a UCLA Extension Windows Forms course. To learn more about the book and the author, read an interview with the author at csharpcomputing.com/Interviews/sells.htm."
4,It provides an unique voyage within the Kernel's networkinkg code.,"As far as I know, there is not another book like this. It complements very well the Kernel book written by Bovet & Cesati, and goes beyond giving to the reader a complete scenario about the Linux Network Internals. Extremely rich in technical details, this book certainly will provide you an unique overview about the subject."
4,"Excellent, in depth review of Linux Networking","The book was exactly what I was looking for - a practical, in-depth explanation and review of the various software components that make up the Linux kernel's network stack."
4,Works fine in three modes...,"After following the set-up instructions (essentially, hold the power button down for 15 seconds) this light functions in three modes (selectable by sequential squeezes of the power button):-low LED-high LED-strobe.Works fine; you can clip it to a zipper, keychain or other place where you need access to momentary illumination while preserving the night vision of others.Similar to theNite Ize BugLitexcept for LED color and fewer options for securing."
4,"Good little light, some drawbacks.","This light is small enough to clip on a zipper pull and bright enough to illuminate/help navigate through the immediate vicinity. The green LED does not bloom out ANVS-9 NVD when used indirectly and in the 'dim' mode, but is still a bit bright in the cockpit, especially compared to a green chemlite. I'm not giving five stars for this product because it has a way of turning on inadvertently by simply bouncing against whatever it may be attached to. Although simply annoying at home or aboard ship, this shortcoming makes it completely unsuitable for any tactical environment. A partial remedy can be found by pressing and holding the switch until it changes to momentary on mode, whereby the light is on only while the switch is depressed, but this removes the benefit of the 'dim' mode, as the light is only in 'bright'."
1,Miserable,These biographees are not what I expected. There not very acurate. There basicly a series of Choreograph dances which try to tell the composer's story. Much of the true biographee of each composers is lost. I would not recomend the purchase of these DVDs to anyone who is serious about learning about these great composers.
2,Not good for the classroom,"I got this set as a gift, and I was excited to use it in my classroom since I'm a music teacher. The videos are not appropriate for a young audience. There is a lot of sexual inuendo, and inappropriate content. The actual information is sparse and instead we are made to watch multiple ballets set to the composter's music, that while artistic, are not informative."
5,Bravo!,"Each composer is exposed through brilliant writing, narration, short ballets, photography, and, of course, his own music. The concept for this series is brilliant and the execution is simultaneously breathtaking, beautiful, funny, sexy, and profound. I frequent the New York Philharmonic and various dance companies. I've had my artwork in the Museum of Modern Art, the Smithsonian and museums worldwide but I wish I had the ability and genius of the artists who created this series. So, I raise my glass to each of the series' artists and yell, ""Bravo!"""
3,Be careful when ordering this book,"There are two editions of this book that were published. This listing says it's for the 1976 edition, but when we ordered, we received an older (50's) edition that did not contain the contributions by Chodorow. The ""blue cover"" version shown is that 50's version. When we finally located the correct 1976 edition with Chodorow's additions, it has a cream binding and cover. It was not purchased from Amazon. Hope this helps any other students who may be after a specific version of this book -- check carefully and make sure you're getting the one you want (and contact the seller if necessary)."
1,Worst Book in College Career,Worst. Book. Ever.I am not exaggerating.Insufficient depth and poor examples that do not coincide with problems. Proofs are round-about.
1,this book is horrible,"This book was terrible. It doesn't follow a logical path within each section. The book itself encourages guessing. Often it completely ignores giving the basis for how an equation is formulated, or the attempt is poorly done. I am sorry for all who must peruse this book, for a class or otherwise."
4,A very detailed book for explinations,This book was very good at explaining all the situations I needed to cover. It provided detailed analysis of various problems that are applicable in every day life. The additional problems at the back of each chapter covered a wide range of difficulty levels and skills.
2,"This book needs less talk, more examples","As a college student, I don't really have a choice, nor do I normally care, what textbook is assigned for a certain class. For my entire math sequence from Calc I - Multivariable calculus I have used Stewart's Early Transcendentals and until I got this book for Differential, I never realized how well set up Stewart's Calculus textbook was. This differential book does not have clearly outlined example problems within the chapter that you can look at without reading through the text carefully. It was difficult to do the chapter homework problems without these easy to find examples to take you through it step by step. The derivation and life story of each equation is mostly irrelevant when it comes to passing an exam. I just want to know how to handle each problem and unique situation. Perhaps one should buy the solutions manual."
3,"A one hit wonder, I wonder.","I must admit, I got this album only because I heard the song ""Little Death"", The best song I've ever heard about fornication. The rest of the album was kind of a disapointment and never kept up with the potential that Little Death offered. It could be that I need to experience them live, but I will say, that one song has everything I love about music rolled up into one song. Some of the guitar licks at the end of the song remind me of Sly Stone's ""Sex machine"". I hate to say buy the album for that one song, but if you've never heard it, it maybe worth it."
2,disappointed,"I recently wrote a review on the virgin prunes saying I like experimental music, but this is a hot mess. I searched for this thinking to get scratchy punkfunk with dub flourishes. Instead I get a band that starts songs with good hooks then leaves them. And dont get me started on Mark Stewart's voice. The only two songs I liked were Theif Of Fire and We Are Time however I will not recommend this album."
2,Excessively edgy,"Avant-garde neo-punk group, akin to Television meets The Ex meets bad acid, are the type that pushes the weird side at the expense of the writing. With their deconstructionist slant and production schizophrenia we are left with little substance and an overriding desperation at sounding different, which is a shame because it seems that with a little more focus this band could have really meant something, hinted at with rare bursts of effectively unnerving, anti-melodic chemistry amidst so much narcissistic clutter."
1,Bloody Awful,"I have no doubt that this is an album that will appeal to a lot of different people for a lot of different reasons (just read all the other reviews). But for me, personally, I was irritated with ""Y"". I can appreciate the fact that the music is different--combining different genres (punk, jazz, reggae) all within the time span of a single five minute song--I just wish I had my [money] back."
5,Best Hebrew Bible,"The only thing I disliked is that the name of the previous owner was in the book, but the sticker with the name was easily removed. As far as the book goes, it's the best Bible in hebrew there is in my opinion. I think that it's a shame that it went out of print."
1,If your professor uses this book - get a second text!,"This book is riddled with typographical errors, very sloppy. In at least one place, the formal pronoun is not capitalized - it's supposed to be capitalized, so this can mislead you! This book is also poorly laid out - tables are difficult to study because oftem they are spread out over two pages and use no shading or boxes to help guide you.I picked up a general Italian textbook at a library sale and it is miles better."
2,A Bit Confused,"Now, I have always practiced Kenpo with the idea ""Keep it Simple Stupid"" in mind. The idea of self-defense is to get away. The idea of teaching a technique is as last resort and is to get away from an attacker. The idea of this book seemed to throw me for a loop. It wants to complicate things when learning a martial art is already complicated enough. You can ramble on for ten pages about a motion when I can say it in a few words: Kick 'em in the groin, chop 'em in the neck."" Yes, if I want to important, I will go into the detail, but only for the benefit that I like the way I sound. I figure only someone with a background in physics would really care to know mathematical formulas. Yes, I know the motion principles, but I don't want to calculate my velocity before striking."
5,Pulling the pieces together. A++++++,"Quantum Kenpo is definately a 5 star book. Its like personally being at a seminar with Mr. Bachman. As Lee states, ""without contact, there is no reality"". Reading Quantum Kenpo is like getting contact with the Art. This book is AWESOME!! If you read this book, you would understand."
4,100% pure USDA nostalgia,"truth be told: these songs really aren't all that great, but that's not really the point. what's important to me, on a personal level, are the memories that this band inspires. ""Bo Donaldson & the Heywoods"" was the first album i ever owned -- it was 1974 or so, and i was maybe 6 years old, but i remember all these songs vividly. white cover, soft lens group photo, feathered hair...ah, yes. i wish i still had that album, but this CD is a nice substitute."
5,Healing and Wonderful!!,This CD has helped me reclaim total healing in my mind and heart due to past upsets and trauma. The author's voice is ever so kind and understanding that I tear each time when I hear the empathy in her voice. I am buying this for other members of my family so their hearts can heal as well. Much love to all who are in this world and those who have been here in the past.
4,Absolutely Fabulous,"Very funny, very unusual, very entertaining! The mystery is secondary to the plot but I did not mind one bit. Refreshing wit and lively characters make this a book you should pick up and read."
2,Revenge of the Cootie Girls: A Robin Hudson Mystery,"Very disappointed in this book...It really started off well... But then the mystery part of it completely dropped off and turned into a life story about Robin Hudson rather then a Robin Hudson Mystery...It's a good read, but definitally not a very good mystery..."
4,"It's Cute, Though Not As Good As Her Other Books",Start with one of the other Robin Hudson books if you've never read her before - you'll be a little more patient with this one if you are familiar with the character. Overall it's an entertaining read - won't change your life - but not all books will.
2,More memoir than mystery,"This book is the least ""mystery""-like of the Robin Hudson series and was a little hard to get through. I read all the books in the Robin Hudson series while waiting for the next Stephanie Plum book to be released -- I was looking for something with the humor, romance, sexual tension and mystery of the Plum series. Of all the books in the Robin Hudson series, the first one (What's A Girl Gotta Do?) comes the closest to capturing those elements. The other Robin Hudson books are lacking in the romance and sexual tension areas. All of them are funny, with some zany characters or situations. This one has some of the more memorable laugh-out-loud scenes!"
4,Flying Blind Rawks!!,"I am a big fan of Flying Blind. I have to agree that they are way, way better live than in the studio and the independant cd is a better but their debut cd is great too! I absolutely love every song and they all have meaning to me. I love ""Smokescreen"" on the new album but i must admit my favorite is the version with the false ending on the demo cd. Flying Blind will sure to be popping up all over the place! Buy the cd you'll love it!"
2,Rather bland and flavor-of-the-week,"Well, picked this one up on a friend's recommendation & was disappointed. There just isn't anything very striking on this disc. It's not really awful, just one of those kind of releases that goes by without really grabbing your attention or providing any staying power.There are moments where the band seems to hit a good hook & pull the song together fairly well. ""Pony"" & ""The Pain Of It"" are really the only standouts that come to mind. The weak points here are the excruciatingly bad attempt at funk, ""Work So Hard"", the soulless Hootie-esque ""Western September Skies"", the unimaginative & predictable 50's romp ""Smokescreen"" & the plagiaristic ""Paralyzed"" which bears an uncanny resemblance to one of Dave Matthews biggest singles this year.I just think that this disc is devoid of any originality & should be avoided by anyone who doesn't rely on MTV to determine the definition of what is truly good music."
2,Disappointed,"The pen is cheap, the pen holder has already torn, and the paper tears off too easily. Save your money."
5,A Gift to All Parents!,Lori and Becky use a solid faith-based framework in walking us through a practical approach to Christian parenting. Their book guides parents in their journey to raise children with a foundation of strong values. It is truly a gift to all parents!
3,"Does not contain SQd mix, which was why I bought it.","Its a good CD, with good breaks and progressive mixes on it, but I was disappointed that it didn't have the SQ'd Mix that I was hoping for."
1,needs work,Very poorly edited video set. Producer enjoys playing with video effects and constantly changing of camera angles. This makes the series more irritating than educational.
1,this is not a DVD,"only audio, not a video! It cannot possibly teach you how to dance. Complete misrepresentation of product! Do not buy."
5,Truely Magical,"I have read all five of the books so many times and I never get bored. They are suspenseful and hilarious. Fred and George are truely funny. And Hermione is a book worm. The third book is especially good. The fifth book is rather sad, but you can definetly relate to Harry's feeling of anger and morose. I actually cried the first two times I read that one, and it stills brings tears to my eyes. Also any child or adult can relate to these books. They have problems with homework and school along with the power of the evil villian Lord Voldemort. I recommend these books to everyone. They are really great!!!"
1,Some Alternatives,"I'm not an expert on Harry Potter, as I have found the writing to be below average and the whole phenomenon to be a bore. However, it is certainly a positive thing to encourage children to read, and if your child is more inteligent than average I would recommend ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card, ""The Lord of the Rings"" by J.R.R. Tolkien, or ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" by C.S. Lewis as superior fictional substitutes to J.K Rowling's work."
1,A complete waste of trees!,"In the UK it's become tantamount to treason not to like Harry Potter so much so that criticism is usually supressed. So imagine my dismay to find so many US readers have also falen for the 'emperor's new clothes'. Harry Potter is to literature what the 'National Enquirer' is to investigative newspaper journalism. Unfortunately, I've not been able to get away from the hype as I've had to read these books to my daughter when she was between 6 and 10. She's now 12 and has got over HP. Anyway, the stories and several of the characters are derivative while HP is the kind of kid who would've had his head flushed down the toilet at my old school. There's far too much description which slows down the pace of the narrative and worst of all all 4 stories are completely predictable. As kids books they may just about be passable but for adults! Give me a break! In summary, mindnumbingly boring."
5,Wonderful Books,"I enjoyed every page of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. Whether in grade school or college and beyond, they mantain your interest until the very last page. I would recommend the book before the movie, as the books go into much more detail."
3,Great but only felt some of these books were rushed.,"I am big fan of Harry potter, in fact I read every single one of the four books. Here is what I have to say, book 1 was good, book 2 is ok.., book 3 was the best, book 4 felt rush. So miss two. 3/5 stars"
5,Can't Wait For # 5,"The author has a great imagination. She's a terrific writer. I have read all four in the Harry Potter set and loved them all. Mom and Dad did too. We're waiting for #5. We all love fantasies. While we're waiting, Mom started reading another book that's actually true stories but written like a fantasy. It's a book called ""West Point"" by an author named Remick. When she got done she liked it so much she got me to read it. I read it on and off only because I'm waiting for #5. I'm writing this because it turned out I really liked it. It has a Harry, too. But not ""Harry Potter"" of course. It's a fantasy, but different than ""Harry Potter"". It's actually true stories. It was great because it had cool cartoons but was also real educational. I learned a lot. But I still can't wait for #5 to come out. I hear it's even better than the other ones if that's possible. I can't wait to see. Thanks for listening."
3,Will The Next One Be Different?,"Rowling introduces us to Hogwart's school for magic and follows the life of a young magician, Harry Potter. His parents were killed when he was young by a evil sorcerer. I must say I loved the first Harry Potter book, I even enjoyed the second. However, I think it is time for Rowling to think up a new plot. When I read Harry Potter 3 & 4 I felt like Rowling is trying to convert Sherlock Holmes medeival style. I know there are few authors out there who can write sequels with originality, but come on. I do not argue that Rowling's books are well written and characters clearly developed, but the plot is getting redundant. I know the art Rowling is capable of, I saw it in the first book, where is it at now??? I mean, come on, at the end of the third book I felt like I was at the end of a very freaky Scooby Doo show where everybody's masks were being torn off. I enjoyed all the books but too many more without originality and I may not be able to stand it."
5,If you like magic get this series,I loved this series because it is filled with magic and rich fantasy.Rowling is a genius.My favorite is the third book.I highly recomend this book to any magic lovers out there.
5,An excellent work of fantasy fiction,"Harry Potter will take you to a world of magical spells and wizards. It's great for both kids and adults. Trolls, Dragons, goblins, unicorns, and many other magical beasts also inhabit this world..."
5,Harry Potter deverses a BILLION stars,"Harry Potter is a great book that will keep you entertained! For people it only took them 2 days to read it because it SUCKS YOU IN! You want to know what's going to happen. Harry Potter is a great book for all ages. My dad reads it, my mom is starting to, and me and my little sister are in LOVE with it. JKR is a wonderful author. This is not witchcraft, evil, or whatever it is about ture friendship and trust. Kids in this book FIGHT evil! This is a wonderful book and it will keep you busy. You won't even know how much time flew by!"
5,Harry Potter Luver,I have read only the first 2 books and i am only 12. I enjoys them sooooo much I can not put the book down. U have to read it! Even see the movie! Another book set to read is THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I cant put that book down ether!
5,Harry Potter Mania,"Everybody has been crazy over these books called what? Harry Potter. It started in 3rd grade a long time ago. Where the first book came out. Everbody wanted to read it. I was a very good reader for my age and decided I should read them. I started reading the book, it was wonderful! I started on the other books. Now I have read the whole set 12 times each. For someone to read some books that many times it must have been good. So pick up a copy, and start reading it. Soon youll be hooked on, youll be reading deep in the night and early in the moring. So to total it up, im saying read the book, try it, you will most likely love it!!"
5,THE BEST BOOKS EVER!!!,READ THESE BOOKS I MEAN IT THERE THE BEST BOOKS EVER AND HER BEST BOOK IS NUM.5 BUT DON'T READ IT INTILL YOU'VE READ THE FIRST 4!!!
4,"Harry Potter books are really good but there is a true fact,","I`m another Harry Potter reader and I love them and looking forward to read 5th book.Harry Potter is a fantastic movie the events are really good,you feel curiosity in yourself while you are reading it.Although it is a good serie and it is a World wide famous one selling millions,there is true fact that we have to face.J.K. Rowling isn`t an author for teens nor for adults these books are really fun,thrilling but there is no debt inside them.You don`t read a sentence more than once,you don`t read it over and over again to try to get and feel what the author is trying to tell.I don`t know English bu in Turkish it is one of the hardest thing to be a good,meaning full author.I believe these books are for kids not for adults I`m not saying don`t read them,read them but don`t thing it is a piece of literature.In order to write piece of literature,J.K. Rowling has to walk a long path."
1,Some Alternatives,"I'm not an expert on Harry Potter, as I have found the writing to be below average and the whole phenomenon to be a boor. However, it is certainly a positive thing to encourage children to read, and if your child is more inteligent than average I would recommend ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card, ""The Lord of the Rings"" by J.R.R. Tolkien, or ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" by C.S. Lewis as superior fictional substitutes to J.K Rowling's work."
4,Harry is magnificent,"When Harry is about 8 years old he finds out that he is a very special boy with unique gifts. This is his ticket to a special school for wizards. When he arrives, although he is made fun of because of his strange odor, he seems to get along fine. This was very inspiring to me because other kids used to make fun of me because of my subpar aroma. This book helped me get through the day, and by the end of school, with the help of prescripton deoderant, i was able to make it through"
5,"Magic and Wizards can mean only one thing, Harry Potter","At first I was skeptical about reading the Harry Potter Series. They seemed to be childish and very boring. After hours of getting annoyed by my friends to read the book, I picked the first book up and began to read it. I finished the book within two days because I was hooked on the book. It was an awesome book and it made a lot of sense to me. I thought the First Harry Potter book was the best book I had ever read until I got to the others. I would have to admit I like the third the best so far. I think that they are great for anyone who just wants to lose themselves in a bunch of excellent books. I recommend them to everyone in every age group."
4,"good books, but bad binding","The books are a great read, but they are put together terribly. I bought the books 1.5 years ago and upon their third use they are falling apart. I would suggest to anyone who wants good copies of these books to buy the paperbacks or other hardbacks."
5,I can't get enough!,"It took me a while to pick up the Harry Potter series - not being someone to play into hype - however, after finishing reading the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings series, I decided to pick up the Sorcerer's Stone - I never looked back. Honestly the best series I have ever read, so imaginitive, so fun - the only problem is I don't quite know what to do now that I'm finished book 4. Great for kids and adults alike!"
5,harrys the man,"I think all 4 books are brillant and i think the film for the frist one is good too.I especcailly like the owl post bit and the chess bit at the end.I can't wait till the next film comes out.I enjoyed the books so much i read them all in 6 days and i am reading them again at the moment.I read philosphers stone in 6 hrs."" "" Chamber of secrets in twele."" "" Prisonar of azkaban in eleven.I am reading goblet of fire at the moment.I think the kid are really good in the movie..."
5,Harry Potter Review,"I read all four of the Harry Potter books and I think they are WONDERFUL! They are the best books I have ever read and I can not wait for all seven books. I have seen the movie about six times and I am anicipating the release of all the Harry Potter movies to come out. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter himself) is adorable and I especially LOVE Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood). J.K. Rowling, keep writting! You are EXCELLENT!"
3,don't expect used books to be pretty,I ordered this product for my daughter for Christmas. I live in Arizona and had the product shipped to Montana. The books arrived in VERY used condition. My daughter was disappointed but decided to keep the books.
1,All You Peeps Out Theya,"It's like this dude...the watchumacallit, hardcover edition is like totally way cooler. this one's a real bummer...if ya luv Harry buy ur version of his HARDCOVER wacky life..."
3,I would give the book 5 stars but...,"The witchcraft in here is all fake magic. I know a heck of alot more about witchcraft then Harry Potter because I am a REAL witch. We are accually called Wicca or Pegan or Celtics. However besides that desturbing deltail, the books are very good. They keep your attention and the detail is incredable."
2,The Emperor's New Clothes . . .,"Unless you are an emotionally deprived 8 year-old with severe learning difficulties, you have no excuse for reading this tripe. It is great that Rowling has strengthened the market for children's fiction, but a shame that she has done so with such drivel. This is derivative, poorly written claptrap, and it will not be remembered in 20 years, let alone 100.(...)"
1,Harry Potter,"Harry Potter seriesHarry Potter is on the ALA top 100 banned books, and I agree with it being there. Harry Potter should be banned because towards the end of the book, Harry and the slithering snake start to become very vicious. When the kids read this it would most definitely give the kids a bad perspective, which is that it's o.k. to be fierce. It should also be banned because of the wizardry and witchcraft. When children read about this it will concoct images that black magic and sorcery are real, and they could try and use it, when they can't. These are just a few reasons that the Harry Potter series should be banned.My rating- *"
5,Not just for kids,"There is no way you can lead me to believe that these are just for kids. Hardly; I'm 22 and most people I know that have read these are my age. They're so much fun and they are incredibly original. Some of the best new stories and books ever conceived. Don't let the witchraft and wizardy detract you from reading this, their truly great. Forget the ""evil"" implications or the promotion of the Devil, it's not about that at all. Besides, kids don't even understand that sort of thing when they're at the reading age of these books. Bottom line, I give them about 15 stars each, so thats about 60 total stars in all. I give these my highest recommendation and I am so excited for the next movie to come out, Chamber of Secrets on Novemeber 15th, and where, oh where, are the next three books!?!"
2,box is flimsily cardboard,"The collection set was great! With the exception of the collector box being just mere - cardboard was a big disappointment! A leather case would have made the whole collection complete. Since all seven books are heavy, it's hard to drag around the box that is flimsily made."
5,My Daughter discovered the magic of reading,"My 11 year old daughter found the magic in reading with the help of J.K. Rowling. After reading the first book, The sorcere'sstone, my daughter was hooked, it was the first time she had finished a ""big book"" she is so into the story. It makes my heart sore and my eyes water when i go into her room an hour after she has gone to bed to tell her to turn her light out, put the book away and go to sleep, and she pleads with me sayin"" ohh mom just one more chapter please!""the story and characters are so alive. You become drawn into the magic.I owe a huge bit of gratitude to J.K. Rowling. She has gotten my daughter away from the TV and into the world of reading.Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
5,Most amazing ever!!,"I love the Harry Potter Books. I'm not a person who likes to read a lot, but boy did those H.P. books grab me by suprise. I can't stop reading and loving them. They are the best books I have ever read in my life. They are so interesting and once you pick one up (even if you've already read it) you can't put it down. I mean J.K. Rowling wrote them so well you feel like you're in the book. You can see vivid pictures in your mind of what you're reading. It's not like some of the other fantasy books I've read. These are way better. They have almost real life characters and they are so interesting. By the time you are done the book you feel like you know the characters as personal friends. I can't wait for the rest of the books to come out. J.K.Rowling... just want you to know... AWESOME WRITING!!!truly"
1,What's so Wrong with Harry Potter? I will tell you!,"The Harry Potter's series is about a boy that is a wizard and does not know it until Hogwart's School of Wizardry asks him to join their school. Harry is living with his Aunt and Uncle because Voldemort killed his parents. Voldemort was one of their parents best friends, well at least they thought so. Harry's Aunt and Uncle are Muggles which means that they are not wizards. All of this alone shows how inappropriate this book is! Voldemort, their best friend, killed Harry's parents? What is this book trying to tell young readers? Personally I do not understand Rowlings whole idea od a fantasy world. The only positive thing that Rowling tells kids is that they need to be careful who they trust. This is not what a young reader in the 8-12 year old range should be reading."
1,"Has nothing on J,R,R Tolkein","Yes this is a good book, but only if you are 12 years old and have a mind so shallow that you could only handle a book such as this. Tolkien created a whole world, his own language and you can find yourslef emerged deep within middle earth on the voyage with Frodo and Sam. You can feel the tension and you feel for the caracters. To so many fans this book when read comes alive and you feel part of the fellowship. Harry potter is just an ordinary book, but yes to a child it is a great fantasy, which to me is just there as a warm up for The Lord of the Rings."
3,Will the masonic reading of yesteryear?,"The finite setting of superfluous reasonings is the Harry Potter genre which supercedes any such precedence. The wizardry, unbeknownst to all, may be a form of metaphoric affluence, but how can we really know? Can such quasi-repetitious countenance convey far beyond what one may see as detrimental?Far be it for me to say, but the preemptive notoriety of J.K. Rowlings might be described as feasible in a sense, but fathomable to all. Preferred is the rudimentary collegians that support the less conservative ""masonic"" foundings of antiquity. But can we be certain that none may be able to ascertain subtle vestiges of the era?Second, the allusion to current day pestilence might be denoted as controversial to the point where one might condition oneself to grappling with plot and character without fully giving weight to more, shall we say, ""benign"" subtexts?Needless to say, I loved this book."
3,Lisa and Jenna's Review,"Harry Potter is a very good book for the childs imagination. It teaches them to read and use their minds. Yet when they read it they learn to believe in Witch craft, that is bad. Harry potter would be a great book if the writter was Christian. The writter is a VERY great story teller and deserves alot of credit. I just think if she was Christian she would have told it in a different way."
5,A Magical Experience,The Harry Potter series is a book that I could read over and over again. I was totally amazed at the way that this book was written. I have never read a book that captured my attention as much as this book has. I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a book that takes you to a magical world and lets you use you imagination in a way that you never thought was possible!
3,Harry Potter Hype and Controversy,"Harry Potter seems to have taken the world by storm. He is popular and controversial. As a Christian I understand some of the objections people have against the books. All I can say is this: the books are never openly hostile against Christianity or Jesus. When I compare these books to Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials Triology, which is basically atheisit propoganda packaged for kids, I believe Christians are targeting the wrong series. Harry Potter is light hearted and imaginative. Let's face it-- there are books out there that are far worse. Harry Potter books contain very little questionable langauge and no steamy sex scenes. The characters stand up for their personal convictions and are compassionate. These books have inspired a new generation of readers. My opinion? There are better books out there. I recommend anything by JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia."
5,Great!,This is the best way to get all the Potter Books to keep and read forever! This is a great idea for gifts for people of all ages.
3,Not what I expected,"The description of the books was ""like new with no marks"". I recieved the books in very poor packaging and they were quite banged up and many of the pages had been dog eared."
1,Use of a brain not required,"I work at a library and am up for trying anything. I saw Batteries Required on a cart and it looked interesting, that is until I started reading it. The dialogue is horrible. Very basic, amature writing. The heroine leaves much to be desired. While Apodaca tries to make her funny, she ends up turning her into a stupid, helpless idiot who can't do anything right. There are many twists and turns, but after about the 5th one, I rolled my eyes and put the book down instead of eagerly reading on. The twists, like dead bodies not being there, cars blowing up and such, were more annoying than anything. The story was not adequately developed and the characters were very shallow. It seemed to me to be comprable to a bad Harlequin mystery than a cute Janet Evanovish read-a-like. If you don't want your brain stimulated and have no problem reading boring dialogue with idiot women as the characters, then you'll love it. Otherwise, go try Janet Evanovich or Lauren Willig."
1,Batteries NOT Required... reading that is,"I'm sorry to say that I just don't get it. This author consistently gets four and five star reviews, and I thought I would really enjoy her stuff based on the reviews I'd read. This is the second Sam Shaw book I've tried (along with the first one in the series), and unless I get really desperate, I won't be back. I find the dialogue to be terribly stilted, the plots seem contrived, and the whole thing is clearly a (very poor) Janet Evanovich knock-off. I wish I saw what everyone else does, because apparently lots of folks find her an absolute hoot, and I love funny books. But these are not funny, they're just... weak. It's rare that I can't finish a book, but I could not bring myself to keep turning the pages in this one."
2,Disappointing,I was expecting to hear the original music from the series; instead I got a souped up orchestral version of the songs in the original series. I was incredibly disappointed. I'm still looking for a CD with the original sounds instead of recreated songs.
2,Dark Shadows meets Mantovani!,"I hate to say this, but unless you are a really avid collector of Dark Shadows material you may not need to get this album. It can best be described as ""Pop Shadows"" or ""Dark Shadows meets Mantovani""! There are ""B"" versions (some might say C or D) of familiar DS tunes done in an over-orchestrated, 1960's pop-music sort of way. If you actually like Mantovani or 101 Strings then this album may be for you... Yes, it's scary, but not in a way that you'll be happy you paid for! (Unless hearing David Selby sing is your idea of heaven!) In all fairness there are some collectable cuts on the album, notably the Radio Spots, the 1969 Vampire Fan Club Greeting, The Vampire State Building, and some original DS Musical Cues. Whether or not these tracks are worth the price of the CD is best left up to the buyer... If you're looking for DS music you might want to try the House of DS & Night of DS Soundtrack CD."
5,"""If You Own The Shows You Must Own The Music""","The one thing I always had a problem with MPI when they released the entire series of ""Dark Shadows"" in the beautiful coffin set was the fact that this wonderful CD of music was omitted. However, this is available separately and it's a superb television soundtrack.Really the first and only soap opera to have its background music preserved on compact disc the music is a wonderful momento of one of the greatest shows to grace American TV.Listening to this 30th Anniversary collection brings one back to Collingwood.But it and enjoy it while your out driving in your car...you will feel like you are Barnabas or Quentin or even Elizabeth!"
2,Not what I would prefer,"All the music on this CD are appropriate, since they all appeared on Dark Shadows, but I would have preferred the more suspensful, scary, mysterious music that played on the show whenever evil reared its head. Examples: Situations with Barnabas, Angelique, when David, Maggie, Victoria, etc. were in trouble with the ""supernatural"" - I think you know what I mean. I already opened the package and played it, but I gave it to my boyfriend, also a Dark Shadows fan. But I feel there should be a CD with all those ""supernatural, evil plots"" music, set in continuous loops, that would really be great for Halloween, or anytime."
3,Good if you are more into classical music.,"I'm disappointed in this cd. It sounds more like elevator music, than that of the shows original soundtrack. It's nice ""background"" music, if you tend to favor classical music. Get out the old lp's and compare the difference. I wish music companys wouldn't try to change a good thing."
5,Great for any DS collector!,"I highly recommend this cd for any Dark Shadows collector. I ordered it for one track only - ""Quentin's Theme"" by the Charles Randolph Grean Sounde. This single was popular on AM radio during the summer of 1969, when the 1897 story line was playing on DS, and it also happened to be one of the best summers of my life. This cd is also full of all kinds of other interesting and hard to find DS music tracks, so it is really a great item. I remember some of the other ""easy listening"" arrangements of the DS music being played on local radio stations, so it's a great memory maker for me. Ah, to be 13 years old and that carefree, again... thanks for taking me back over three decades."
2,Not what I wanted,"This soundtrack I ordered in hopes I would receive the music from the series...what it is instead is variations and alternate versions of the songs I wanted...close but no cigar. The track that contains the actual ""sound effect"" musical shorts from the series is cool...to listen to once, but can drive a person crazy after a while...it goes on forever! I especially wanted ""Back at the Blue Whale"" and the version here isn't the regular heard on the series. Disappointed in general, I then ordered the Original Music from Dark Shadows CD, which I'm listening to right now, and can already tell I like it better. If you're looking for the versions of the songs from the original series, this CD will disappoint you, instead, get the Original Music from Dark Shadows CD!"
4,"Great look, quiet and 3 or 4 pin connections","I got this fan to replace a side case fan mounted on a plexiglass window. I am definately pleased with this fan! It contains a 4 pin passthru connector ( one plug that has male connectors on one side and a female connectors on the other ) which is more convienent that 2 seperate plugs. It also has a 3 pin connector with an attached 3 pin plug for temperature monitoring for mortherboards that are equipped with this feature.The fan is relatively quite, only slightly louder than a Vantec Stealth. I blue L.E.D.s are a really nice color. ( the color is similar to that of an Indiglo watch. )I also purchased a 3 pin to 3 pin extension cable thru amazon that helped."
3,"cool color, loud fan",This fan is 80MM. Has motherboard speed control connector. Haven't found setup for this in BIOs yet.Pros: It has a really cool blue color. Easy to install.Cons: It makes quite a bit of noise. Much louder than my stock LED side fan that came with my case. Of course that's what's being replaced. At least this one works.
4,What a twist!,"This book had an interesting plot that made you want to know what happened to the main character next. The ending was a complete surprise, something that I would have never expected. I can't wait to read the next book!"
2,Way to much detail and no real conclusion,"Like the other one or two star reviews, I thought the author included every little bit of detail of the period, 1955 -56, from Castro to the victim, and the book is thus very inconclusive and I simply did not care for it. At the end you are still not certain who the killer was, but I stuck with it, and like so many other books I ended up not liking wish I had quit after about 3 chapters. I have also read Infamous by the author and gave it a five star, so try that book instead."
2,TOO MUCH OF EVERYTHING,"Starts promisingly but meanders into subplots galore and peripheral characters that only distract the reader from the ""point"". Speaking of which, I think the point is to include every scrap of local color and historical data that Atkins compiled for the book. It's as if no detail is too extraneous to be omitted, and every notorious character of the period must be included. A little judicious editing would have been much appreciated."
5,Any Ace Atkins book a cause for celebration,"Atkins never disappoints; whether it's Nick Travers tracking down a killer or his latest, ""White Shadow"", a fictionalized history of the strange and savage death of Florida kingpin, Charlie Wall. Watkins command of texture and prose is exceptional and delightful. If you love the printed word arranged in beautiful weaved phrases you will love this book. Atkins loves the area and has an artist's passion for this work.Ace Atkins is a blossoming superstar. And, he's young so his best is yet to come.""White Shadow"". Buy it, read it, let the prose wash over your mind. -- W. L. Ripley"
2,"Close, But No Cigar","Other than spending a bit of quality time with Robert B. Parker when he was alive, I'm not sure how Ace got the job to write novels over Parker's signature. It certainly wasn't the result of Ace having submitted a draft to some ""Spencer"" afficianados.Anyone who has read even two ""Spencer"" novels actually written by Parker would spot the obvious ""fluffs."" And, they'd spot the fact that Ace evidently decided, at the outset, he'd re-make both the main character and the means by which the story was told.If you're a ""Spencer"" fan, save your dough. Go back and re-read Parker's works from the beginning... and when you get done -- bury ""Spencer"" as they buried Bob."
2,Constructed with poor materials,"I purchased and used a Swiss Gear hikers tent several years ago and used it several times. I was so pleased with it that I turned again to Swiss Gear and purchased model 36289 when I needed a larger tent. I just used the new tent this weekend for the first time on a two day campout and it was a big disapointment. The plastic feet that the tent poles insert into are attached to the tent by a thin ribbon material. Before the tent was was even completely up, 1 foot sheared off the ribbon and I had to improvise to make it work. By the end of the campout another foot was almost sheared off and a third had started. The feet them selves are fine, it is the thin ribbon that connects the feet to the tent that is the problem. Since I purchased the tent on an end of the year clearance last year, I won't be able to return it. Therefore I plan to contact the company directly sometime this week."
1,Beware: NOT by Wham! All BAD cover versions!,"THIS IS NOT WHAM! This CD contains 3 tracks: all ""Non-Stop Club Megamixes"" that are actually medleys of horrible Eurodance cover versions. If you love hearing untalented singers mixed with bad dance production, this is the CD for you. But if you're a Wham! fan, you'll want to stay far, far away from this."
5,Excellent Tape,Good tape. Sticks well. Invisible. Does the job. Free shipping for Prime members like me. Nice !
3,Not Impressed,"I purchased this item as a filler for Super Saver Shipping. If I had only realized that it was only one roll of plain old regular tape, I never would have purchased it. It cost over $3. It wasn't until I was tracking my order that I realized what I had actually ordered and even then, I expected it to be special or different from other tape for that price but was sadly disappointed to find that it is no better than any other tape that I have used that cost a lot less. Granted it is a bit thicker but it's not really ""invisible"" as it claims. I can clearly see it on anything that I have used it on."
5,TOTALLY INVISIBLE!!!!,"When I opened up the box I though that Amazon had screwed up and forgot to include my item. But then I noticed the rattling sound inside the box... INVISIBLE TAPE!!! While I was initially disappointed that the tape doesn't match the online picture, this disappointment wore off after I realized the value of completely invisible tape. I like to stick in on my cats and they can't see it.Unfortunately I set it down somewhere and forgot where it is! Next time I'm going to get a slightly more visible tape for convinience."
4,Enemies - a Love Story,"I have recently bought the video of this film and very much enjoyed it. The acting, direction, music and photography were all excellent. However, I do have one gripe and that is the sound quality. I had to re-run the tape several times to find out what the actors were saying. I don't know whether it's a sound fault or the actors mumbling. Whichever, it marred the film for me. I do love the film, though, and have played it several times."
2,Long and Drawn Out,"It's a hellish tale about a modern jobe from Bashevis Zinger's Novel. Herman Broder (Ron Silver) is a Polish Jew living in Coney Island after the Holocaust. It is 4 years after the end of WWII and he works as a writer and has a wife whom he wed because she protected him from the Nazis. Meanwhile, he's enjoying the company of another woman during 'business trips' when he finds out personally that his original wife thought to have been killed by Nazis is alive and in New York!! It sounds so absurd that you might think this movie is a comedy, but it's not. There are funny moments, but throughout this movie you will become wrapped up in the very serious moral dilemma of a man married to two women while he's in love with another and the conflicting emotions that all of the characters feel and experience. All of this is brought in a suffocated, sarcastic, sweaty manner, that you feel his suffering. It's really not a movie that I'd recommend."
4,Enemies -Review,Great Movie - Set in post WW2 New York but highly relevant to todays age of complex relationships - deals with the classic problem of multiple relationships and provides deep psychological insights we can all relate to.
2,Great movie. Lousy soundtrack remaster. Disappointing!!,"I have to concur with another posted review. Played a rented DVD on my home 2-speaker system. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is flat, muffled, and during several outdoor scenes, features a digital ""howling"" harmonic from background sound FX (street traffic, maybe?). It made the film difficult to listen to, and disappointing. The laserdisc release featured ""Dolby Surround"" audio (now called Dolby 2.0), which would indicate that someone messed this new release up in the transfer. Shameful."
1,Enemies : A Warner Bros. Ripoff,I don't know about anyone else but I bought this dvd having seen it when it was first in theatres and remember it being enjoyable. The story of a Jewish immigrant in New York who finds himself either married or invovled with three different women at the same time. So far so good but here's where my problem comes in. I put in the dvd ready to enjoy myself and I couldn't hear what was going on. The sound quality on this pressing was TERRIBLE! The music and dialogue kept going in and out and was muffled so bad that I didn't even get a chance to see 10 minutes of the movie. It says it was in dolby digital stereo and I have a surround sound system and I still couldn't hear without turning the volume way up and it still was muffled. I returned the movie and didn't bother getting another fearing they were all pressed the same way. Did anyone else run into this problem or did I just get a bad copy...
5,Thermostat,"This was a cheap thermostat and works better then the high priced one, keeps the temp in my house within .5 degs."
3,More novelty than substance,"This is a wistful collection of quotations garnered from a wide variety of artists, writers, politicians, &c who have contemplated or, at least made a side remark, on the nature of ennui. I got this book for free at a library sale, and honestly, I wouldn't pay that much more for it. I enjoy having it around just to flip through, particularly when suffering from ennui, but its utility is not much more. As with any book of quotations based on a theme, especially one as complex as ennui, it is hard to take the content too seriously because of the lack of context for each quotation--and without the context, it's hard to contemplate the nature of what's being said, which renders this book, more or less, a novelty item."
2,:(,"Removes phosphate as noted, however use of this or any gfo drops the alkalinity a degree every 24 hours, you will end up spending money on buffers and constantly adjusting carbonate hardness. The best product a person can get is the sea salt and do regular water changes!"
2,"Worth having, but disappointing.","I bought this CD for clean copies of ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" by The Foundations, and ""O-o-h Child"" by The Five Stairsteps. I hoped to find more hot tunes like them amoung the 17 total tracks, but only really found ""Everlasting Love"" by The Love Affair to be close in quality"
3,Misleading title on web services,This book has a misleading title. It has a small section talking about web services API by amazon. This book would help a beginner PHP programmer though.
1,Could have been a terrific book,"Unfortunately, this book has many errors in it and, until the publisher (Sybex) decides to release an errata sheet in order to make it truly usable, I can't recommend it. (I'll be happy to revise this review if they do.)This book has the potential to be one of the best on the subject - the author's writing style is clearly a cut above most other technical writers and he seems very knowledgeable about the subject. Unfortunately, as it stands now, the book isn't usable by a beginner because there are so many errors. PLEASE fix them!Update (Feb 3, 2004)I give up - since I first posted this on Amazon, nothing has been done to fix the errors. Neither the Sybex site nor the authors own web site deal with the problems in the book. Look elsewhere if you really need to learn php."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I'm using this book for a class. Most of the students have had bad experiences with PHP before this -- I'm one of them. The back of this book states it is rated for an Intermediate/Advanced user level. The rating is totally accurate. Unless you have a basic but decent PHP background you will be lost. The author uses special characters, terms, etc. that are not previously defined, and assumes a basic understanding of programming. If you do not have a basic understanding of programming and an elementary knowledge of PHP, find another book. This one does not give enough background in PHP to get a novice up to speed."
4,Loads of practical information for your web project,"This is the perfect book if you're planning to build a complex website and don't really know how to achieve this. If you need to build a web site with a membership system, news section, content management system, online store, process payments and track visitors, but you don't know very much about PHP scripting, don't think twice. This is your book. It just get to the point. The author gives to you all his experience building large interactive web sites with PHP.The only drawback that I can see in this book is the title. The chapter about webservices does not tell you anything about building SOAP or XMLRPC servers, instead of that, it tells you how to connect to the Amazon or Google Web services APIs and get the information you need, which is also good.I definitely recommend it to anyone with this kind of interests, even if he really doesn't know anything about PHP or MySQL."
4,Rodne Jones is Incredible!,Wow! Great concert and high quality production. The whole band is exceptional. Rodney's playing is sooo soulful. Inspiring for Jazz Guitar players.
4,Irwin Allen,"I really enjoyed the 2nd set of DVDs. Whit Bissell looked older than dirt in the interviews but it was fun seeing all the folks again.Irwin's Time Travelers movie was a neat addition. Sam Groom had played ""Jerry"" in TT and I guess had made a good impression on the producers. I met him years later while filming ""The Rats"" - nice guy"
4,Kinda corny but fun...,"TV shows are simply not what they used to be. Anthology series are simply not out there anymore. Although this would not be considered a true anthology, each episode is different. Not at all like the Twilight Zone or Thriller but still fun. My complaint is that the time travelers are two scientist that seem to be able to destroy any and all foes in battle. Why do I find it hard to believe that these two scientists could kick the poop out of Arabian soldiers. Kinda quirky. Still, the series is a fun one to watch and enjoy."
5,It ended before it's time,"Saturday afternoons...flipping through the 3 TV channels...FOUND AN EPISODE OF TIME TUNNEL! That's how I remember these. They made my Saturday afternoon when I was young, and they still do. So share some entertaining history with someone younger, and make Saturday afternoon all over."
3,All the really silly episodes are in this set,"This second set of 15 episodes is the one to get if you enjoy Time Tunnel for its unintentional comedy value. All the stupidest plots are here, including ""Revenge of Robin Hood,"" ""Pirates of Deadman's Island,"" ""Merlin the Magician"" and the jaw-droppingly ridiculous ""Death Merchant"" (Machiavelli at Gettysburg? What were those writers smoking?). Here too are the many episodes which lamely attempted to mix aliens from space with period drama, including ""Raiders from Outer Space"" and the laugh-out-loud ""Visitors From Beyond The Stars.""On the bright side, this set also has ""Kill Two by Two,"" one of the few episodes of the series that actually works, thanks to an intriguing script and a wildly intense performance by the late Mako.There's also an unaired pilot for a new Time Tunnel series from 2002. It isn't half bad."
1,Don't waste your money,I ordered both of the Time Tunnel DVD's. Never got to the second one. Poor acting and very dated effects.
5,Good show,I just love this show .Video nice and clear and sound great show.The service was great and fast and on time.
4,Good 60's Sci Fi Camp,"The history lessons are nice, albeit skewed by inaccuracies. The producers and writers didn't adhere to the 'butterfly effect' because they let the main characters interact with historical figures that would have changed history irrecoverably. The greek and American actors playing Mongolians is a farce and the fact that all characters speak English, or fabricate pathetic foreign accents makes this a campy treat!"
4,Educational?,"Like Volume 1, you learn a bit about history particularly real heroes and villains as well as dates each historic event occured.The only thing I didn't like about the series is that the 2 time travellers as well as the tunnel technicians can't control their destinations. It would have been nice if they knew where they are going next to make preparations.I like movies or TV series about time travel so I enjoyed Volume 1 and 2 especially the Titanic and Pearl Harbor episodes."
4,I wanted more,"I'm very glad to have the entire series on DVD after 40 years. Was it a great show? No, but as a 10 year old when it came out I loved it, and the trip down nostalgia lane has been fun. The pilot for a 2002 series was interesting, but keeping the names Tony Newman and Doug Philips seemed a stretch. But, there's a lot of unused space on these disks, and there is a wonderful documentary, The Fantasy World of Irwin Allen, that could have been put somewhere.I wish that ABC would do a revival show, after all, Meriwether, Darren, and Colbert are still alive. Bring them home!"
4,A SCI-FI'S CLASSIC ('The Time Tunnel' I & II),"The Time Tunnel is a a sci-fi's classic of the television history. The episodes are all of interest, the adventures are magnificent, the stage is extraordinary, the performance is sober. But the are two negatives aspects: I show that the tunnel becomes closer and the actors must stoop on having begun or to go out, and jump sparks on having changed time; it would worth a change of color in the lighting of the hoops of the tunnel."
5,Titania's Fortune Cards,"My friend has these cards and everyone at school goes mad about them. All the times i have used them the cards have been true. Once was when i had some problems with my friends and before it happened it said that i was going to be betrayed, and then i was. Next was when they said that i was going to fall in love and i have just a week after reading them. They are a dream come true!!!!"
1,Debbie Downer,"I bought these based on the reviews here and they are beautiful cards, they come in nice packaging but they are alarmingly negative. I could ask anything and I will get a negative answer."
2,Dog-fight dog of a game,"While I wasn't expecting much, I was still disappointed. The game has little to do with simulating aerial combat, as one of the features of the game is a ""wrap around"" board: planes that leave one side of the map enter the other side. So the game is an exercise in guessing where your opponent might randomly end up. Very little strageizing, too much luck.The game is ok with my young kids though, as it gives them practice adding numbers.The board is not very well made, experiencing alot of warping.The planes are very cool though. It would actually be helpful if the board were smaller so that you wouldn't have to reach over it and knock other pieces out of place"

2,Dissapointed,"My teacher told us to pick up a test prep guide book, and that's what I went to the library to do. However, once I flipped through the book I was dissapointed to find nothing but sample essay respones and questions. This is good if that's what your looking for, however I want more subject review. I would reccommend AP Success English Literature and Composition by Peterson's instead."
3,"Not horrible, but not the best AP English prep book by far.","This book is packed with information that has a very slim chance of actually helping you on the test. The synopses of literary works seems redundant; all one really needs to do to study for the ""number three"" questions on the AP test (the only area for which a literary review would be absolutely necessary) is have a few works recently read and ready to expound upon: Hamlet, Antigone, and Candide are three good ones that come to mind. A more in-depth exploration of the multiple choice section of the test would be useful.Checking this book out of the library might be a good idea, but I wouldn't bother purchasing it."
2,AP Ace,"This is a pathetic AP preparation book. The examples are terrible, the questions are way off (please note that I used this for the AP English Literature) and unhelpful. Magical REalisim WILL NOT be on the test. The sad part is that almost everyone reads Toni Morrison's over-hyped and overrated Beloved in preparation for this test. Honestly, dont' buy this book. Buy some other AP prep book, make sure you have read Hamlet, The Plague, maybe Potrait of an Artist as a Young Man, etc."
2,It's allot of fun but......,the skateboard is aloot of fun but it does not hold up very well. I try and keep it out of water and do everything that I am suppose to and the paint is still chipping off and the wood is still getting exposed. Once Mattel fixes that prolblem I would buy one but until them I would not reccomend them
2,needs improvement,I bought this for my daughter and it is alreadycomeing apart and she did not have it very long .she enjoyed the design of the switchboard .
3,barbie switchboards,"I bought 2 of these for my son (almost [...]) and daughter (age [...]). I like the design, and the collapsible handle is very cool. So easy to store and transport! But the durability is very bad. The finish on the edges after they got bumped started to chip on each after only one use! Looks like the inside is particle board not wood. Don't know how long these will last, but the kids are having fun with them anyway. My son loves his. My daughter gets frustrated with hers because it is difficult to steer."
4,Roger jr.,"I first got this cd when it first came out,about 2 years ago,its been in my cd changer since then.I'm sorry to report that not only has Roger passed on,but also Roger Jr.This cd is very nice & at first I thought it was Roger."
3,Decent Vegan Product,"I love that this is a vegan conditioner. It does not, however, leave my hair soft, and I'm not overly fond of the fragrance."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!!!,"Utter disappointment!!! The producers and distributors of this video ought to be ashamed of themselves!! The two books co-written by Father Ciszek stand alone in their piety and holy messages. This movie is a flagrant rip off of the hard work and suffering of the saintly priest. The title should be stripped from this DVD and an apology should be issued to anyone who has been led to believe that they are buying anything close to the beautiful and inspired work of Father Ciszek. Shame on you, Ignatius Press. Shame on you!"
1,flavorless and old: candy shouldn't be painful,These fruit slices were stale. They had no flavor but some vague sweetness. The texture was hard and chewy. When were these made?
3,A little disappointed but I'll keep doing it,"I have done yoga in the past. I used to own Jane Fonda's yoga video and I found that quite enjoyable. I haven't done yoga in a few years, but when I bought this, I expected it to be the traditional yoga I was used to. Maybe it's because it's Kundalini Yoga and I'm not used to it, but I found it to be a little dull.The AM set is much better than the PM set. The PM set didn't have as many poses as the AM set and the poses in the PM set are too long and drawn out. It seemed like they got lazy with the production. Even though I have these complaints, I will still work at it because the poses are challenging and I do feel I have worked the muscles I was supposed to, but it just wasn't what I expected."
3,YOGA DVD,I RECEIVED THIS DVD AND I USED IT IMMEDIATLY- IT IS EASY TO USE AND AFTER YOUR YOGA LESSON YOU ARE SO DISTRESS.YOU WILL BE VERY SATISFY BY THIS DVD AND ITS EXPLAINATIONS
5,AM-PM Yoga,"The entire dvd is great; I especially enjoy doing the pm yoga when energy starts to lag in the late afternoon hours. The format for all the Raviana dvds is terriffic and consistent throughout all the nine videos I have collected so far. However each one is different in specific ways, and all are challenging and fun. I toally enjoy the breathing exercises and meditations, as well as the physical work."
2,Kundalini Yoga may not be what you expect,"If you haven't tried Kundalini Yoga before (which I hadn't), I would suggest trying maybe another tape like Kundalini Yoga for Beginners before you purchase this one. It's very different from the other yoga tapes & classes I've tried, and just wasn't what I happened to be looking for. I think the tape itself is probably very good, but didn't fit my needs. I have to blame myself for that because I just read through all the reviews, which were great, and didn't stop to look up what ""Kundalini"" was. Plus I have to say that Ana Brett looked like she was trying not to laugh through parts of it!"
5,A must for your collection,"AM & PM Yoga with Ana Brett and Ravi Singh is the single most practiced DVD in my collection. (I have all of Ana's & Ravi's and more of others). I reach for this DVD the most because each session is quick (20 minutes), fun, and a great practice. I especially like the breathing practice in the AM session. The breathing along with the postures has helped my digestion and the way my stomach feels. Also, practicing consistently has helped me develop strength in my core like nothing else I have ever practiced. The chanting and flow of the PM session along with the ""walking on the ceiling"" puts me back into a peaceful state after a stressful day. This is the DVD I recommend the most when people ask. It is a great introduction to Kundalini Yoga, easy to follow along with, and it really makes you feel great. Take my word, if you purchase this DVD you will be practicing it for years to come."
2,for advanced fitness levels,"I hurt may back trying to do this video, I do not recommend it for beginners or even intermediate. If your abs are already really strong you could do this video, but be careful!"
2,tile #1305 black & white,The facing on this tile seperates from the backing .I have used four boxes and had seperation on ten tiles.
2,black and white tile criticism,"First impressions of the tile were very good. It looks just as I expected it too. However, during the installation of this tile I discovered an annoying flaw, that caused a lot a extra work to make it look right. The tiles were not all uniform in pattern, so in order to make the corners of the black and white squares printed on the tiles to match up with those on the ajacent tiles, it was necessary to trim nearly every other tile. That is not the way it should be.Steve Ashkinazy"
5,Awesome,I dont speak a lick of german but this cd is awesome!! I really love Deutschland!! It has a great tune.
1,Still Waiting,"The Ascot Cereal bowls were ordered the middle of Nov., and I still have not received the bowls as of Jan. 11. It would have been helpful to know the delivery problem sooner."
3,Tiring,"I've really loved most of Stephen White's books, but this one was somewhat of a chore. I found the characters less and less likeable, with the strange exception of Bob, the schizoid patient. What I found most tiring, however, was the endless repetition of the sanctity of therapeutic confidences. While I understand the idea was central to the book I felt like I was being smacked over the head with it...over and over and over. After a while I wanted to smack the main character."
1,Babbling and Boring !!!,"I read Blinded by Stephen White and liked it. This book however left me wanting from page one!! The characters are uninteresting; and the author introduces new evidence and characters that are dull and have nothing to do with the story. The story itself is so Convoluted that I soon just started reading the dialog, hoping that it would `get better' or finally be worth reading. At the mid-way point I gave that up too!!! And just read the ending, something I have never done before. My advice would be to skip this book it's not worth your time or mine. The `mystery' is less exciting then a cracker jack box prize and makes less logical sense too!!!"
2,Entirely forgetable,"In Missing Persons, Dr. Alan Gregory is investigating a missing persons case, hence the title. Meanwhile, a woman is killed in his colleague's office. Later, this same colleague goes missing. All of this makes for a convoluted story that is at times hard to follow. Gregory is continually conflicted about disclosing patient information as he tries to help find the girl and his colleague. The book failed to hold my interest in its entirety. As the story progressed, I found it to be continually harder to follow, and I also found myself not trying very hard to follow it. I've read other novels by Stephen White, and I don't find him to be an effective or engaging story teller. I would pass on this novel.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
2,Not up to standard,"I have read all of the Alan Gregory books in order and always look forward to the next one. This was a terrible disappointment. All the talk about the ""other girl"" and his ethics were boring after the first time they were mentioned. I was interested in the plot but this book could have been 200 pages instead of almost 400. I also got tired of what he was thinking...move on to the plot. I have the next book to read also but think it will have to wait awhile because I read for pleasure and not someone else angst. Get over yourself Alan and get back to better stuff."
4,good book,"Good story but it is missing something, but I would still recommend this book. Maybe it is time for a new character."
3,Multifarious mystery,"This was an interesting story if one could struggle through the tangled and overly complex plot lines. While the ethical dilemma aspect was key, tighter writing and/or editing would have eliminated much of the tedium. Some authors do a credible job of connecting fact with fiction, but in this case, the veiled references to the Ramsey case were merely irritating and (should Stephen White be looking towards ongoing interest in this book) over time will be meaningless to future readers."
3,DULL,"While I have enjoyed most of the books in this series thus far, this installment has me thinking that maybe the best of the Alan Gregory stories are found in books 1-12.Once again Alan Gregory finds himself involved in a dangerous situation that is revolved around his psychology practice. Like Dr. Gregory says on page 80...""Karma does seem to deliver mayhem to my door with disturbing regularity."" No kidding!When I picked up this book after a long day, I didn't get that sense of urgency to get to the next sentence, paragraph, or page. Mostly, I read to get to the end of the chapter, so I could mark my place, and get a good nights sleep. The pages turned about as fast as they would if I were reading the DSM-IV code book cover to cover.I can appreciate that Stephen White is himself a psychologist and he writes about what he knows. Up until now, I've found his work interesting and his stories fun, however this latest addition just didn't do it for me."
2,Therapist / patient confidentiality ethics lesson,I listened to the audio book narrated by Dick Hill who is one of my favorites. As usual the naration was superb by Mr. Hill. It almost made this book palatable but the neverending and obsessive preaching about ethics and patient confidentiality was way beyond tiresome. This experience was kind of like listening to an ethics textbook disguised as a mystery. I have enjoyed many of Stephen White's other books and will continue to check them out.
4,Solid Thriller,"Another Dr. Alan Gregory mystery. Intersting plot twists. A growing pile of missing persons. What I enjoy most about Mr. White's novels are the psychiatric pathologies of his ""clients"" and this one has some good pathology. There is probably too much hand wringing about ethics for my blood but A GOOD, QUICK READ!!"
3,Not As Good As The Rest,I was a little disappointed with this book. It was just ok. I'm used to so much more with Stephen White's Dr. Alan Gregory novels. I'm not going to write a plot summary since Amazon and other reviewers have already did that. I didn't feel the connection with the story or the characters. There was a lot going on with this book and Mr. White didn't take the time to let you know any of them. I also got tired of the patient confidentiality concept. Yes it's there but you don't need to keep hashing it over and over and over again. I thought it was a quick read though and it was enjoyable to the point that it moves the Dr. Gregory series along. I'm hoping that the next book in the series is worth it. I would highly recommend this to anyone reading the series. But don't make it your first Stephen White book you read or you may not get to really feel the series.
2,WARNING---MISLEADING LISTING,"I ordered this item expecting it to be 3 Die Hard videos, but what it is is two of the movies and a third video about how the movies were made. Very disapointing, especially as this was a gift for a Bruce Willis fan. Item description should be more exact!"
2,Disappointment,I didn't bother reading the other review. Very upset that the trilogy turned out to be 2 movies & 1 making of the movies. I ordered the trilogy because I specifically wanted the last show-Die Hard with a Vengenance.
1,"WARNING: This is not the ""Ultimate Die Hard Trilogy"" set!","I want to deliver a loud siren to those who are unfortunately still stuck with the VHS editions of movies. This product I'm reviewing here is not, I repeat, NOT the Die Hard movie trilogy that contains all three of these excellent movies in one.This product is just a two movie set containing the first two movies and a third tape with commentary about the making of them. Don't get me wrong, the first two are absolutely awesome movies and worthy of rememberance in the action movie genre but this product is a total waste of time and money.Do not be fooled by the name of the product listed on this site. It may say that it's a trilogy but this is a totally obsolete product that has no merits for being bought unless as backup copies.A total waste of time and money. Once again, do not be fooled into thinking that this is the same product as the box set. It's just the first two movie."
2,The name says it all,"What will come from a a capella group doing an album called ""Instrument"". No good enough stuff...Since this is Neri per Caso's second album we may guess they thought: ""OK, our first album was a hit, now let's move to be a normal pop group."" But the result was a mediocre pop album. With the exception of two tracks, ""Improvvisando"" and ""Perche' di Notte"" that are almost a capella, the rest is plain italian-pop, so there is nothing special with this album.For the real Neri per Caso go with the first album (Le Ragazze) and their fourth self-titled album."
2,Couldn't even finish it.................,"This book sounded great until I began to read it. I got to about page 70 and decided it wasn't worth the time to read. There are so many people mentioned in this book that it is absolutely impossible to remember them all. Even at page 70, I had lost track of who was who. Also, the writing isn't smooth at all and it is extremely hard to get ""Into"" the story."
2,Cries In The Desert,"I didn't think this book was that great. I had to force myself to finish it. It does not delve very deep into the lives of the players, just skims across the surface. Also, there are so mnay people mentioned in this book, it is hard to keep them all straight!"
2,This story could have been better written,"I really think this story about David Ray Parker could have made a much better book.I always like it when a author gives you a lot of details about the person who committed the crime,why he/she did this to the victimsOn the end i still had no better picture of David Ray Parker or his daughter or his girlfriend(s).This book was more about (how can i explain) the facts. then everything around it.Maybe some of you will say, wauw thats what i want, but i read a lot of true crime but this was a bit disappointing to me.On the end it keeps you with a lot of questions and because of the way he wrote the story..it was not very frightening, although it was of course horrifying to hear of these facts.Before i read this book i had never heard of David Ray Parker or the crimes he committed.There is another book on this crime. called Slow death by James Fielder.(...)"
2,Very Average,"I read a lot of these books and this one is very average. Bought based on the reviews and subject matter. This book could have been great the story has everything from sex, murder and mystery to family involvement (very creepy). That said the book is boring and has very little detail or info you can not get from the web. Ok but very sub-par if you ask me."
4,Toybox of Terror,"David Ray Parker along with his girlfriend Cindy Hendy get their ""kicks"" from abducting unwilling women and holding them captive for three days. During those days, the unimaginable happens. David Ray has a Toybox of Terror that is filled with sexual aids, a gynecology chair and a video camera. After he has had his way with them he drugs them and leaves them in the middle of nowhere. It is appalling to think of what these women went through. This guy is sick and demented, unfortunately he's smart too."
5,"A Gripping, Page Turning Read - Excellent","This chronicle of ""Sex"" Torturer David Ray and the crimes of his daughter, his girlfriend and and another ""friend"" was a fast, page turning read. The narrative flows easily with many descriptions of how the ""gang"" of evil nobodies were successfull for years in their twisted fetish and how authorities finally put the criminals in prison. Even with the disturbing content of the crimes described in the book it keeps the readers interest and provides a few surprise elements as well. Highly Recommended. UPDATE: as of the writing of my review the girlfriend and other friend of Ray still sit in the New Mexico prison system. His daughter is on probation. Ray himself died 8 months after sentencing - having served a total of only 3 years of his 238 year sentence at the age of 62."
2,Preliminary review,"I haven't used this scanner extensively yet. I am scanning old paper records. Sometimes two sheets get through at the same time. This may be a problem with other types of scanners as well-I have no experience with other sheet fed scanners. It seems to scan fast, and the Papersoft software seems to work well so far. It is unable to scan photos (with thick paper)-the photo will go off course and jam. This seems to be a major flaw."
1,Did not work with Vista,There were no drivers to make it work with windows Vista so I had to return it. This a a bummer for Xerox.
3,Good but not Great,"I thought that Diana's performance in this movie was good, it wasn't great. I would have love to seen the other characters in the movie reaction to her success. How did Diana's(Tracy's) character discover her love of fashion, why did the film not bring her success to America. None the less, the movie was good not great."
4,"Mahogany,Fantastic 70s Film","This is one classic movie from the 70s Terrific move.Dianna Ross & Cast are great.One thing though,for being such a great movie of the 70s why does Paramount put this Dvd out with not much thought?.I gave it 4 stars only because the least the studio could have done is re-master the sound in stereo.I mean come on in this day and age is it that hard Paramount Studios? Extras would have been great too.Iwould have even paid a few extra bucks if even the sound would have been re-mastered.Great movie & story though & a piece of 70s History & Miss Ross."
4,Mahogany,The movie has a few flaws but once again Miss Ross shows us just how talented she is by designing all of the clothing for the movie. Plus having a number one hit song from the movie.It must be hard to be beautiful and talented.
5,Do you know where you're going to?,"Classic Ebony theatre, Diana Ross should have Academy Awards for this epic. Definately a pioneer movie to Black theater."
2,Another Overrated Film,"Another reviewer called this movie an overly dramatic fluff piece. That's putting it nicely. This movie is a complete waste of time with a storyline that was frustrating to follow. The only thing I got from this movie is that once you rise from poverty into riches and fame, you become shallow. Oh and Billy Dee William's character was an insecure loser of a man who was also a wannabe alderman. Far as I gathered, Billy Dee Williams was a slacker who wasn't seen as such because he was always running for office -and losing. Of course Diana Ross's character made Billy Dee William's character feel insecure about her success because he was insecure. Somehow, she was to blame for his own insecurities and the only viable solution this film offered was for Diana Ross to get off her high horse and worship this loser as if he were the King of Zamunda for no other reason than --love. Will she succumb to this? I recommend that you don't find out for yourself."
3,Middling star vehicle for the Detroit diva,"This Diana Ross extravaganza of a ghetto gal who evolves into a Rome-based mega-model is okay but nothing special. Perhaps the producers thought they could recapture the chemistry that Ross and Billy Dee Willams shared in ""Lady Sings the Blues"" which earned Ross an Oscar nomination for best actress. It didn't happen in this picture and Ross, a fashion designer wannabe, has more going for her than Williams, who is portrayed as an unsuccessful politician and comes off as a loser and a failure who can't make it on his own. Tony Perkins steals the film with a neat turn as an eccentric photographer at odds with his sexual identity. Old pros Nina Foch and Beah Richards are good in minor roles but the temperamental Ross is the focal point of the movie. The picture's theme song, ""Do You Know Where You're Going To"", was a blockbuster hit for Ross, and has several brief reprises during the movie."
5,Great quality,It's my first time ordering online and the shipping time was great. That quality of the movie was very good. I'm glad to add this movie to my collection. Especially if you're a Diane Ross fan :-)
3,Diana Strikes a Pose,"A mere five years into her solo career, Diana Ross propelled herself into the high camp stratosphere with ""Mahogany"" (1975). This hyperglamorous star vehicle is the type they used to make for Joan Crawford or Lana Turner; sort of an urban Ross Hunter production. The costumes (all designed by Ross herself) veer between the gloriously tacky and the lushly beautiful. Camp fabulousness aside, Ross actually gives a rather good performance; she has always been a natural acting talent who comes across as extremely likable and charismatic onscreen."
5,Classic!,"Diana Ross returns after her acclaimed film debut in 'Lady Sings The Blues. She plays the role of an ambitious struggling secretary who becomes a world famous designer-model (hmmm...). Diana Ross is a challenging & versatile performer and in this classic flick she showcases her impressive talents. Watch out for Anthony Perkins 'reprising' his Norman Bates persona.Over the top plot, cheesy dialogue, wonderful soundtrack, glamorous costumes... Diana Ross never looked more gorgeous!"
1,Overrated Fluff,"Only the most steadfast Diana Ross fans will appreciate this overly dramatic fluff piece. The movie's purpose is to show that a woman cannot be happy without a man, all rich and famous people are shallow fair-weather friends, and a woman should throw her own talent away in order to settle down the right man, which has to be a man from her own race and socioeconomic background (i.e. he doesn't let her head get too big because he knows where she came from)."
1,Frankly awful,After the wonderful LSTB movie which was very special comes this movie which is frankly awful and best forgotten. The story outline is so bad and it was sad to see Diana and her co-start Billy Dee Williams appear in this dross.The best thing about the whole project is the theme music. Would advise anyone who has seen LSTB to stay away from this.
1,wish i could see it,"i recently purchased this video (mahogany)staring diana ross as a present for a devoted fan who has never seen it. unfortunatley for him,the video is a standard amarican format wich does not work on english video machines,it would be of great help to me and other people if this was made clear when purchasing videos.i now have a video i cant wacth and a verey upset fan on his birthday! can i still return it over a mounth later or do i have to buy an amarican video player.! (any suggestions) rleonhunt@aol.com"
4,Large Pillow,"Okay, I bought this as a Christmas gift, so I can only give my opinion at this time. I may come back to this and update later-maybe. If I'm inspired and if it lets me.I think the fabric is a bit rough. I mean, I would have preferred a higher thread count for this pillow's fabric. (It does not zipper off) It's somewhere between burlap and 700CT. I'm being harsh, but softness is one of my things. Now, I understand it was only $25 & I see that it is more for 'decoration' than actual ""use"", so that's why the 4 stars. I would not buy this with 'use' in mind, but for show or display....it meets my expectations. I hope the gift is received well. :-/The box it came in was ginormous and they should think about reducing the cardboard box by at least half. IT'S A PILLOW! IT'S NOT GOING TO GET BROKEN OR SMUSHED- IT'S A PILLOW! Hello?"
4,Enjoyable,I'm a big fan of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band so I was curious when this solo cd came out. I enjoy it a great deal. He may not have the greatest singing voice but the music is great.
1,He is no singer.,"The man plays great sax, but can't sing. This is a vanity CD. He should stick to what he does well, and not embarrass himself. This is a total rip."
4,Night with Mr. C,"I've been a Springsteen fan since the late 70's, and a Clarence Clemons fan since the late 80's. The cut ""Night with Mr. C"" is a cover of Gary U.S. Bonds' ""Quarter to Three"", and it totally rocks -- fabulous sax & vocals. Of course, you'll need to get the original ""Quarter to Three"" to compare. Clemons also covers ""Twisting the Night Away"" creditably, and the rest of the album is OK."
4,Victory Over The Darkness (Study Guide Edition),"This is a valuable tool along with the text titled, ""Victory Over The Darkness.The questions are not only relevant to the text one is redaing, but provide forinsightful answers that help shape a knowledge and understaning of the keysto ""Victory Over The Darkness""."
5,Muchas Flores...............,"It must have been early morning around seven a.m. A friend of mine was playing some music on his computer. ""Déjame Ver"" was the name of the song. This guy listens to hardcore rap for the most part, and yet he was listening to this smooth piece of music by Rosario Flores. I stopped, looked at him, sat down and started to listen as well. There's no doubt in my mind that Rosario can sing. Not wanting to be drawn in by one song alone, I listened to the entire CD. Her music reminds me a lot of Spain. I've been there twice in my life time. The people are very hospitable (attempt to speak the language and you'll make instant friends) and the food is awesome. If you get the chance, don't let this CD past you by. Venture out of your comfort zone and listen to something that you've never listen to before."
5,me forgotten,So far I am still trying to figure the game out. I am a little confused so I need to go to the tutorial and reread the instructions. But I love finding hidden objects and game is one I will continue to play.
4,Add it to your collection,"This import cd on the Repertoire label(famous for their remastering talents)is well worth owning for the following tracks- Rest in peace, No water in the well, Moonshine and Trust in you. Despite what the other reviewers are saying, this is a good cd. Sure the other tracks fall flat, the band even admits this was not one of their better efforts- too dry a recording, wrong producer, female backing singers(groan)as well as some weak material. But I have it and I listen to it, what's that tell you? But of course I am also a big fan as well. Sound quality is good not great but as good as it will get without a high tech 2001 rebuild. This is the Mark 2 lineup with Laurie Wisefield."
3,Could of been a deal breaker.,"(1976) Wishbone Ash's 6th studio effort ""Locked In"", almost broke up the band. This isn't a total washout it has some strong songs in, the smoldering rocker ""Rest In Peace"", a concert staple in the mid to late 70's. ""Moonshine"", ""Trust In You"" and ""No Water In The Well"", are excellent tunes. Produced by Tom Dowd. Later in '76, they came out with ""New England""."
4,"Englishman finding self in Algarve, Portugal","Henry and his fiancée visit the beachfront property promised them by her father - and try to convince the senhora to sell - with unexpected results. In the land of Prince Henrique the Navigator (son of Portuguese king and his English wife), they come into contact with a different approach to life and it causes them to see each other in new and different ways. First published in 1968, the story describes the changes still in the making in the Algarve as it struggles to retain its culture and joy while sharing in ""progress."" Delightful to me after a week's visit to Albufeira, Faro, Lisboa, Sagres, Algarve, the setting of the novel."
1,I am Happy I did NOT get this as a gift for a child,I ordered this item for my daughter who collects Bryers and it was embaressing. it is so small and cheap looking I almost did not give it to her. Come on Bryer you can do better than that.
2,It's okay....,"I bought this over a year ago and I really want to like it, so I keep coming back to it. I have yet to make it through both both disks without skipping songs or bits of songs. I have ""Bird in a House"" and the ""Black Bear Sessions"" and despite the label's assertion that those two recordings were basically done live without extensive overdubbing, based on ""Elko"" I can't help but think RRE is something of a studio creation. As a guitar and mandolin player I found the jams on Elko to be flat, the fiddle (exuse me, violin)sounds way to spacey for me and I didn't particularly like the whole mix. It just seems to be missing some of the urgency of a live show. With that being said, if RRE were to visit my neck of the woods (fat chance) I would go see them; you can't after all ever really capture on tape the vibe that makes live music so great, but RRE should try making another live recording some time."
4,vailtrail.com CD reviews by Samantha Donen,"For a bunch of Jersey boys, the six-piece band, Railroad Earth, truly captures a unique Americana sound. Their choice of instrumentation, like the mandolin, upright bass, penny-whistle, dobro, and banjo, should make them a bluegrass band. But throughout their debut live album, Elko, they explore various musical idioms ranging from Celtic to rock and country to folk. With their knack for lyrical storytelling, songs like Colorado and The Mighty River incite visions of traveling across the country. Web link: railroadearth.com."
5,Great Stuff,"Not much more to add after the other reviewers, just wanted to emphasize how great this album is. This is truly a must have for anyone who loves jazz piano. Track 3, ""Button Up,"" on the first disc is simply amazing, with some of the most beautiful exchanges on the recording. (Anyone else notice the person in the audience yelling out ""Christmas!"" at 13:33 on that track? I can't figure it out...) Also, I would like to add, that anyone who is really intrigued and awed by Herbie's touch on the keys should check him out on a recording of Maurice Ravel's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra in G (especially the 2nd movement). All in all, with these guys playing together, you cannot possibly go wrong!"
4,relaxed,"very nice for relaxing to, especially the first CD of the boxed set. the second CD is better in being for me more technically astute, and challenging.overall having listed to a anthology of Herbie Hancock, this was and is for me one of the better recordings over his career............."
3,"I honestly don't like CompactFlash Card,","Probably its cool, but I hate this kind of Card I prefer MMC.1. Faster2. Cheaper."
2,Kingston = SLOW,"This Kingston card uses a multi-level-cell (MLC) Flash made by Toshiba and writes much slower than the single-level-cell (SLC) models. I would avoid Kingston if you have a high resolution digital camera or frequently use the burst mode on your camera to take several pictures back to back. For MP3 players or lower resolution cameras, this card may be fine. Just keep in mind that it will also take longer to write MP3s from your computer to this card than it will with others. I would opt for a card made by SimpleTech, which is in the same price category but much faster."
1,Does not work with a Nikon Coolpix 4300,"It would be really great if Amazon and other resellers did a better job outlining which accessories were compatible with which products. This is stated as a CF Type I card yet this does not work with a Nikon Coolpix 4300--another, more expensive Kingston card, must be used."
1,Kingston CF/256,"Bought the Kingston CF/256 for my Nikon CP5000, to replace the little SanDisk 32 MB card I got with the camera. Turns out this Kingston model isn't compatible with the Nikon CP5000. If you want a Kingston CF card for that camera, consult Kingston for their model recommendation.Bought a Lexar 12X 256 MB card (faster than 12x makes no difference in that camera) and it works great."
5,Money well worth it for a comfort like this one!,"I work with sport injuries everyday. These shoes provide great stability and comfort for anyone who rolls their feet outward or inward. I tried on a pair of shox, but the comfort was not there. This was definitely a great investment for me."
2,heavy,"These shoes are very heavy and quite unresponsive. I can't really use them for anything else than really slow easy runs. They might be better for hiking than for running, I guess."
4,It is easy to use,Advantages:1. easy to use2. cooking effects are good.Disadvantages:1. Alarm sound is too harsh.2. Cannot set the cooking interval.3. Hard to clean the top part.
4,measure correctly,"I like my steamer, the rice comes out perfect for pudding, Spanish or fried recipes. I must admit that the first time I used it, I didn't put in the right amount of water, too much, and it did bubble up and out. bummer. However, I discovered clean up was super easy, much better than my previous cooker.Vegetables turn out evenly cooked, just remember not to overload the basket.I cook for one, it's nice to have this streamer to make portions that serve both dinner and leftovers for my lunch box. If you use a larger utensil to cook in, the result is food evenly cooked and the seasoning is uniform, and only one pot to clean."
4,"Looks solid, cooks well","I have used it just three or four times so far, but it works very nice. Rice doesn't stick to the bottom if you are careful with the amount of water and the time you put your rice in. I wish the steamer pan was not plastic, though... my previous rice cooker had a metal steamer pan."
4,A little faster and it would be perfect!,"Our family members are rice-cooker veterans. When it came time to replace the Black and Decker, which we never liked all that well to begin with, we began to shop around for value and flexibility of use. The Aroma ARC-838TC was our guy. And still is!Perfect rice every time - the only downside is that you have to plan ahead. It always seems to take about half an hour, which is about twice as long as we remember from previous makers. As long as there's time, we couldn't be happier with it."
2,mediocre,This cooker disappointed. The rice did not cook evenly and then dried out in the warmer. replaced with a Tiger 10-cup...over the moon
5,Cool rice steamer!,The steamer is pretty cool. I got it only in 2 days and the rice cooked by it is very professional!
2,Two Big Problems With This Rice Cooker,"I'm surprised at all the good reviews on Amazon. I have used this rice cooker several times now and we are going to give it away to charity. Here is why:1) The horribly loud beeping sound when the rice is done. If you have kids napping close by, they will be woken up. If you are next to the rice cooker when the beeper goes off, you will have to cover your ears. And guess what- There is no way to turn this off! And there is no volume option for it either. It's truly an awful sound and it goes on for about 10 seconds.2) This rice cooker is really only made for large quantities of rice. If you put in one cup of dry rice, good luck getting the proportion of water right. I dumped in 4 cups of water and it still did not cook the rice all the way. It only works correctly with 2 or more cups of dry rice.The rice cooker also feels cheaply made. Very flimsy plastic all around. I do not recommend it at all."
1,Pretty Bad,"I read the reviews and recommends and that prompted me to buy it.. I use it to cook brown rice. It leaves it either hard or mushy. The only control is to turn off the warm cycle. With this off it still cooks until the rice is burned on the bottom. I have to put a lot of extra water in the pot and get to it before the water is used up because if I don't the rice is burned, now its mushy. I went back to stove top cooking. Now I am wondering what I'll do with this failure. I guess I can always steam hot dogs.."
5,Works great.,"This machine worked wonderfully. Never had a problem with it, cooked like my last rice cooker did (till it broke that is). Love the cool to the touch bonus for this model. And the steam vent is redirected so it's hot but doesn't instantly burn you if you're quick.For those who complain: READ THE DIRECTIONS! Brown and wild rice take 2 or 3 times more water and it's a guessing game. You'll make a bad batch or two then you'll get it (if you're bright). For white rice it's as easy as 'set it and forget it'."
5,Excellant!,"I use the rice cooker at least every other day, if not every day. Love it! It takes about 3 cooks to figure out the perfect length (about 20 minutes) for rice. Meat doesn't cook quite as quickly as the instructions say. And I leave the vegies in with the rice after unplugging the machine for another 5-10 minutes to finish them off. But once you figure it out, it's an easy meal in 30 minutes or less."
4,As described,I have made several different rice dishes in this cooker. Everything turned out great. (even brown rice) the only issue I've had is making a small amount of coconut rice (1 cup) browned a little on the bottom. ( most likely due to the viscosity of coconut milk and not the cooker.
2,"Burn Rice in Warm Mode, Stale Rice when TURN OFF, BAD RICE REGARDLESS","This is not decent cooker. It's way overrated! The biggest issue with this cooker is that it burns the rice at the bottom if you put it in WARM MODE over night. All my rice was burn and became uneatable. My previous Japanese Made Tiger Rice cooker was much more simple and functional. It cooked and KEPT THE RICE warm for DAYS!This cooker I have to turn it off completely to prevent rice burn, and then I have to turn it to WARM MODE 1 hour before my meal to make sure my rice is warm and ready to be eaten. When I do that, I have to finish all my cooked rice in about three meals as leaving it cold over a period of couple days makes it go stale due to the condensation build up inside.It's very inconvenient."
1,Not a fan,"I needed to have the ability to cook a lot of rice for a dinner and bought this thinking it would do the trick. Alas, the rice turned out gummy. I tried different methods prior to the dinner but found all unsatisfactory. Perhaps it will work better for steaming food."
1,You get what you pay for,"This rice cooker is super inexpensive, so I think it's reasonable that the aroma isn't the best rice cooker i've ever owned, but it was a waste of money since it doesn't cook rice very well. I grew up in a Korean household with expensive rice cookers, so I'm used to warm, well-cooked rice being a no-brainier. I'm not too happy with how this one bubbles large amounts of gross rice water out the top, and how it overcooks the rice at the bottom every time. The keep warm function basically continues to cook the rice, so it's useless unless you want some crispy rice snacks. The inner rice bowl is NOT dishwasher safe... mine got weirdly discolored and warped when I put it in the dishwasher (I probably should have known better since it's a non-stick surface inside). It's at least easier than cooking rice on the stove, so I think it was worth the $40, but have to give it a bad review bc it pretty much sucks in every other way."
2,Aroma Rice cooker,"We prefer the one made from Japan like our previous. This is made from China. It burn rice on the bottom and the side is still wet. Rice will go bad if cook over night. If we use all the rice during the day, it will be fine."
3,Okay at Best,"The rice cooker is okay for the price, it cooks rice..The whole process of having to wash the rice is a real hassle, and then adding just the right amount of water is annoying. I mention the water measurement because it seems if you go over a little over the specified measurements you're screwed and dealing with a bubbling, gurgling drooling rice cooker that becomes much more difficult to clean. The cooker also takes quiet a while to cook the rice, but overall it's alright-not the best..not the worst."
1,"Worthless as a Vegetable Steamer, Food falls right through!","I got this steamer for Christmas and was planning to use it for a vegetable steamer. What a waste of time! The ""steamer tray"" that is included has holes that are almost 1/2 inch in diameter. The manual has directions for vegetables like green beans, peas etc. but they fall right through the holes. What idiot designed this? It would be perfect if it had small slots instead of these gaping holes.I was speechless when I unpacked this thing because of the ignorance of its manufacturer. It was an expensive laugh for sure."
2,low end rice cooker,Although Rice Ccoker has a low price it has the following problems:Warm feature overcooks riceFlimsy lid construction seems looseDigital timer did not seem to workhave to unplug cooker after each use
4,great deal,We all have a great time. It's very simple to learn and set up and has several different types to cook.
3,"Cooks well, but cleaning is a problem!","The problem with this design is the ability to clean the cooker. I have noticed that with wear, as the lid becomes dirtier, the quality of rice cooked is lower ( and perhaps unhygenic), and the cooked rice doesn't even keep for as long as it should, even in the refrigerator."
5,Buy once keep it for life.,"This rice cooker is amazing. It's simplicity is very enticing and makes cooking all sorts of rice a piece of cake: rinse, measure, cook, you're done. Rice cooks evenly and perfectly all of the time. The steamer attachment works well, but it can be a pain since you have to ""time"" whatever you put in it, it forces you to look at the manual and see the cooking time table, and can become tricky if you have mixed vegetables while also cooking rice.Overall, this rice cooker is worth the money if you just want something simple and not bogged down with useless features. In other words: it cooks rice, it steams and does it very well."
4,Rice Cooker,"In our family, rice is a staple. This 8-cup rice cooker is fantastic. The added bonus of the food steamer option adds real value to this appliance. You'll need to buy rice paddles separately but for the cost, this is a great buy."
3,Not as satisfied as other reviewers,"This rice cooker does burn the rice, almost as soon as it sounded that the rice was done. I wish I had more choices when selecting the type of rice that I am cooking. With this one, you can control the ratio of rice to liquid, and that's it. This is my first rice cooker, and may be my last one. I don't think I would buy another rice cooker, unless I could see it in action first."
2,Aroma ARC Rice Steamer,"This steamer does not know when the rice is done. It overcooks some of the rice at the bottom of the container around the outside edge in toward the center about 3/4 of an inch. This overcooked ring of rice is not eatable. The bulk of the rice is well cooked, of nice texture and very good. The dog enjoys the overcooked rice but we don't.This cooker also puddles some water on the outside top of the cooker. I tried increasing the water to the rice but that didn't help much with the rice but increased the size of the puddle on top. I would not buy this unit again if I had know of these problems.This cooker keeps the rice warm and in good condition for a very long time after the cooking cycle. This steamer is easy to clean."
3,Not the best,It does cook the rice very well but if you leave it on to keep the rice warm the rice sticks at the bottom and it turns brown.
2,White rice only!!,"I love rice, and I eat all different kinds of rice - basmati, jasmine, brown... This will do a good job cooking white rice, but that is it. Your brown rice will never get done and you have to keep adding water and starting it up again. This is just a mediocre appliance."
4,For those who do not know how to cook brown rice....,"You have to add 50% more water when cooking brown rice. I read a couple of reviews that said it can only cook white rice. Follow the instructions it gives you for the different types of rice. That particular person must not have read the directions.Do not place it under cabinets. It won't hurt it right away, but after several times, may cause problems with the wood.Great value and product."
5,So far so good!,"I bought this cooker because I needed something small that wouldn't take up too much counterspace, that that was still of good quality. I make a lot of sushi at home and had previously been making my sticky rice on the stovetop which is really not the best way for consistent rice. So last night was the first time I used this cooker to make sticky rice and the rice came out soooo good. It was perfect consistency and evenly cooked and fluffy but sticky. The only thing I noticed is that when it's done steaming it automatically goes into warm mode, which is nice for other things, but for sushi rice it needs to be turned off right away to let the rice set...so I won't be able to use the timer feature for the sushi rice, but other than that I think it's a fabulous machine (especially for the price) and I'm looking forward to steaming my veggies on it tonight!"
1,Aroma ARC 838 TC rice cooker review,Worst appliance I have. Given as gift. Tossed it. Its cooked rice is terrible while plain cooking in pot is good. DO NOT BUY THIS COOKER.....you will be un-pleased. Not impressed with vegetable steaming either. Rather steaming while cooking rice ends up poor at best. (I did not buy this through Amazon rather through a big box store.)
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this rice cooker 3 weeks ago and regret ever buying it. It only keeps the rice for 1-2 hours, after that it turns the rice into mush. Spend the extra $30 and get a Zojirushi, trust me its well worth the money. You get what you pay for..."
1,useless,"I got this useless junk as a gift. I should start this off by saying that I am a decent cook, and am accustomed to making brown rice on the stovetop. The first time I used this, I noticed it was quite slow to come up to temperature (at least 10 minutes to a boil with only 2 cups of liquid). Midway, it seemed to be going OK, smelled good, but then the thing turned off before the rice was cooked. This was about 50 minutes into the process, but the rice was still too hard. Then, you are left guessing if the thing is still heating or not, because there is very little indication of what it is doing on the panel. The cook light was on, but there was no steam and the rice was still moist, so it seemed to be only warming and not cooking. In the end, it took about 1.5 hrs, where on the stovetop it would have been done in 50 minutes. Maybe if you only made white rice this would be OK, but if you have any skill as a real cook don't waste your time with this. Mine's going to the dump."
2,Too Much Plastic,"I didn't realize when I ordered this rice cooker that it would have plastic parts which would be exposed directly to the steam (and hang over the rice) while cooking. I don't cook with anything plastic which could leach into food. If you're not concerned about that, maybe you'll be happy with this rice cooker. The basket for steaming is made of very light plastic, the seal around the inside of the lid is made of a very light, delicate looking material, and the steam escape valve inside the lid is plastic. My old bottom-of-the-line rice cooker was glass and metal. I guess I need to get another one of those!"
1,DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If you are looking for a good rice cooker...don't buy this one!!!!! Takes too long to cook rice...and the warmer turns rice into rice krispies!.....Pay a little more...go for a Tiger or a National...this is an awful product...buyers beware!
4,Spanish Rice,We had guests that wanted a Mexican theme. We had the rice and they had a watery salsa. I substituted some salsa for the water and we had a very tasty Spanish Rice.
2,Paint coating at the bottom burned,"It's a very nice looking rice cooker and it does what it's suppose to do but the pot is coated with some shiny coating at outside and I see burning marks on the base after using it a few times. Also, the internal coating (rubber?) is so thin that it got scrach marks after a few usage."
3,works as it should,"This is a good rice cooker. Cooks rice well. Nonstick surface is nice. I'm not a fan of using the steamer while cooking rice. I don't like how whatever's steaming could drip over the rice. I would've also liked a separate lid for the pot instead of having to store it back into the cooker in order to close it. Since I tend to cook rice for two days at a time, I usually would just take my old rice cooker, put it's lid on, and put the remaining rice right in the fridge. But I can't do that with this one."
4,Hi,Good. Would have been better if it is strong at handle part. Its handle broke after an year or more.
3,Rice cooker,Works as advertized. Probably would buy up to one that has more control over the temp and cooking cycle ...........
1,Cheap Plastic Vegetable Tray,"The steam tray for this rice cooker is made from <5>plastic, which is the plastic used for yoghurt and margarine tubs. It was quite thin and floppy. Although my research tells me this plastic is safe for general usage, it's worrisome that this plastic will be exposed to high heat day in day out. I had to return this rice cooker and get one with a steam tray made from stainless steel. Steaming vegetables on a piece of cheap plastic just didn't seem like a good idea. The workmanship for the entire rice cooker also seemed pretty shoddy upon close examination. The whole thing also smelled strongly of plastic once I opened the box."
1,It's defective when received,"The item was shipped via second day shipping(thanks discover card). I took it out of the box and ready to give it a test ( I really need the delayed-timer function it comes with). However, after placing it on the table, it's not flat. ??? then I noticed that the electric board at the bottom of the rice cooker has already fallen out. I tried to put this thing back myself and was unsuccessful. At the same time I noticed that the bottom has some sign of using. Apparently someone returned it before and Amazon just shipped to me without even taking a look at it! I have been satisfied with Amazon all the time but was disappointed this time really."
2,Doesn't work reliably,"There must be some sort of quality control issue with these units, I'm in the same situation as the others who are reporting that the cooker doesn't always cook the rice properly. I've had the unit for about 8 months. In my case, 1 in 10 uses yields a ""done"" alarm and the unit goes into warm mode but the rice has barely started cooking and the cooker is still full of water. All you can do then is trash the rice and make another batch. I'm going to end up having to buy another unit and doubt I'll go with the Aroma next time."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased this rice cooker mainly to cut down on the time required keeping track of brown rice. Not only does it not save any time or hassle, it doesn't even do white rice well. Regardless of ratio of rice to water, setting etc. the rice (white and brown) always ends up sticking or burning and usually undercooked until I add more water and try to bring it back to an edible state. The company has been totally unresponsive to several attempts to figure out why this piece of junk doesn't work."
3,didn't work as it claimed,"I just tried the steamer for the first time, carrots. I expected the timer to switch to warm mode as described in the booklet, but not only did it just keep on steaming way beyond the time, but the water recommended was not enough, and evaporated. I had to finally just open the lid and take out the carrots. Big disappointment. The ""easy"" to use program does not seem to work on this."
2,not so great,"I'm surprised at all the positive reviews. This rice cooker consistently over cooks rice, even if you take the cooked rice out of the cooker as soon as it is done. If you leave the rice in there after it's cooked (when it's supposed to keep it warm), the rice continues to cook and forms a crust. Without a clear plastic lid, you also can't see anything, which I think is less than ideal for e.g. vegetables. All in all, I wish I'd gotten something else."
2,Aroma 8 cup,"This rice cooker does not cook evenly, the rice on the bottom was dry and overcook. I had tiger brand before, it was better."
5,"Love It, Worth It !!!!!","Ordered this product a year or two ago and still love it, works great, does the trick, good quality, easy to clean. I thought it is being lazy using a cooker instead of just stove top, but it is so nice to be able to start the rice and not think about it and be able to work on other items while cooking."
5,Looks and works great,"I've made several pots of different types of rice ranging from 1 - 3 cups and they've been cooked perfectly. I will say that shorter grain rice and wild rice tended to send quite a bit more starch through the steam vent - resulting in a small sticky pool, but this is fairly easy to clean. I would recommend jasmine rice if you want to use this cooker to its fullest potential."
5,USE THIS EVERY NIGHT,Coming from a Caribbean country I eat rice frequently. This rice cooker/ steamer works great. I can make rice and veggies at the same time. The rice comes out perfect almost every time but even when it's too soggy you can just steam it a bit and it ends up tasting great. Not too firm but not too soft. My old school mom even bought one for herslef and she loves it. Very easy to clean and looks great on your counter-top.
4,Rice Cooker,I got this for a replacement for my older rice cooker. This one is very sturdy and does a good job with both white and brown rice.
4,I like the rice cooker,"This is my first rice cooker so I have nothing to compare it with but, it did a good job."
4,Unbeatable for the price!,"After my old rice cooker died, I was considering buying an expensive Zojirushi cooker that uses an ""induction"" cooking system and costs upwards of $200, until I came across an Aroma rice cooker at a discount membership store that rhymes with Roscoe. The one I got is very similar to this one, but it also has a setting for brown rice and holds up to 20 cups of rice. The price was also $29.I'm very happy with it. The rice comes out pretty good. Not perfect, or ""restaurant quality"", but good enough considering the price. The steaming tray and programmability are great features and are usually seen on higher priced cookers. The best part is the $170+ I saved!I add a tiny bit of cooking oil (just a few drops) into the water before cooking and it helps keep the rice grains from sticking together. It's also important to wash the rice thoroughly until the water is clear before cooking."
3,Works most of the time,Most of the time it cooks rice well but every once and a while it will just keep cooking it forever instead of turning off so now I have to watch it all the time because I'm afraid it will just keep cooking the rice that is done.
4,Great gift,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom, and she loves it! It is a little tricky to use at first, and a little tricky to clean, but it makes great rice. It is the perfect size for a big meal or a small meal. Also, the steamed vegetables are delicious."
4,Good cooker,"pros: good build quality, cooks good rice, convenient delay cooking (although I don't use it),cons: cooks rice a little slower than my previous cooker."
4,Great rice cooker for white rice!,White rice comes out perfectly each time - I have not had as much luck with brown rice no matter how much water I add. The cooker is easy to use and cleans up easily as well.
5,Hard to beat a product that does what it is supposed to do,"I bought this some months ago (along with aSushezi) and have gotten a lot of good use out of it. The non-stick coating is a definite plus over a rice cooker I had many years ago... especially if you're making any kind of sticky rice. Since I'm often cooking for both family and company, this size cooker is good to have around. While you can use a cooking delay with it, I find myself dropping in the ingredients and pushing the start button and then just walking away. So far it's perfectly done sushi rice, long-grain white, brown rice, basmati, wild-rice, etc. I think I'm going to get a lot of years of use from it."
3,Opsec,"Overall a good read, highly detailed and well written accounts of Special Ops Aviation Units and Missions. One concern is the information divulged in the Chapters regarding Search and Rescues; downed pilot recovery/rescue includes info. on ""authentication process"", this subject matter should NOT be made public knowledge- certainly NOT at such a detailed level. Operational security SHOULD have been a concern with the author, compromising information towards the safety of downed pilots has NO place in public view. -BZ"
3,Great book but didn't catch attention,"I enjoyed this book. It had those accents, like the others said, but I liked them. They were interesting and gave the book an interesting and challenging touch. The book had some good parts but it didn't really grab my attention until the last two chapters. This book had a sad touch to it, I even cried at some parts. Some places were a little predictable. I seem to be more into funny books. This book was never really funny."
5,Excellent!,I really liked this book. If you like books about other cultures this is your kind of book. Please read this book.You will not regreat it. The person on top of my review does not know what he or she is talking about!
4,Great Music,"I bought this CD after hearing parts of it in the video game. I was very impressed, especially by track 6, Xizor's theme. It was a great sort of counterpart to The Imperial March. It seems that the bad guys always get the best music in movies. Xizor is no exception. If this book was ever made into a movie Joel Mcneely should definitely get together with John Williams on the soundtrack for it."
4,"Creative, as ""Original"" as John Williams, but Different","This soundtrack, drawn from the themes that typify John Williams' music for the Star Wars cycle, goes far beyond. It open the door to Williams' use choral motifs so effectively in Star Wars Episode One's Duel of the Fates.McNeely follows Williams' habit of drawing upon the compositions of Shostokovich and other Russian composers of the late 19th and early- to mid-20th century. In particular, the distinctive waltz theme in The Seduction of Leia is drawn directly from Aram Khachaturian's Masquerade: Waltz & Mazurka. This is a well-established tradition, enjoyed by most of the film composers of the last 50 years.A welcome addition to the Star Wars canon!"
5,Excellent Soundtrack,"I love John Williams music, and I thought no one could even get closer to his Star Wars music, but I guess I was wrong. McNeely did an outstanding job with his composing, he takes you into the Shadows of the Empire world as if there was a movie about it. Almost all the themes are exciting, but I think the best one is Xizor's theme in which you can imagine his ruthless personality and his clever thinking. This CD is a ""must have"" for every Star Wars fan, specially if you have read the book."
4,Texturally rich,"An interesting piece in the impressionistic vein. While it's called the ""soundtrack"" to the book, it's not a scene-by-scene interpretation; some tracks are, to be sure (""Beggar's Canyon Chase""; ""The Battle of Gall""), many of the other tracks are orchestral suites based on the characters of the (rather mediocre) book. ""Xizor's Theme"" is quite good, and ""The Seduction of Princess Leia"" (written as a waltz) has a very 'slavic' feel to it. And finally, the purely impressionistic ""Imperial City"", with massive dynamics from almost silent to booms and crashes worthy of any Romantic Composer. Williams' themes make brief cameos here and there, some more obvious than others. All in all, a very pleasant album."
1,Terrible,This is an awful soundtrack. It doesn't come near Williams' score. The orchestration turns the brilliant theme into a mush of jumbled string sounds. A huge disappointment.
1,just music-no story!!!!,"when i typed in a search for this audiobook, this is what came up. nowhere on the cover does it say soundtrack. i wanted to listen to the audiobook on cd like i did 10 years ago on cassette."
5,Excellent product,"I just purchased this thermostat, from Amazon, to replace a 20 year old Hunter thermostat which was failing.I chose Hunter because I trusted the quality of their products. I didn't want a programmable model, becauseI don't use those features and it just makes it more complicated than necessary! Installing this thermostatwas a breeze! I was finished in 45 minutes and had no problems at all! The thermostat works perfectly and thedisplayed temperature is completely accurate. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it toanyone who just wants a plain & simple thermostat that is easy to install and works perfectly."
4,Good Product,The product that I received was in very good condition and works exactly as described. I have no complaints about the Hunter Thermostate at all.
4,Hank the Space(y) Cowdog!!!,"This story by John R. Erickson is about a dog named Hank. Hank lives on a old ranch.Hank eats a dead chicken, and gets blamed for killing it. Then Hank runs away, and meets sneaky coyotes. More trouble is about to happen!I really think you should read this book because the dogs are funny. They remind me of my dog, who is a total space case.I liked this book,you will,too!"
5,Hank the Cow Dog,These books make great gifts for children. I wish the boxed set could still be purchased. That was always my favorite gift to give parents of newborn baby boys.
4,"I very funny, light-hearted read.","I had heard people talk on and on about the great ""Hank the Cowdog"" series of books. I grew curious and decided to break down and see what all the fuss was about. I picked up book #1. All I can say is, it lived up to the hype. The narration was top notch! The book had a good story line, and contained interesting characters. I found the book laugh out loud funny at times! This would be a wonderful set of books for your children and the whole family to enjoy together! Happy Reading!"
3,Great use of puns. Good book for dog lover,"Fun kids book that works well for adults, too. The humor is simple, but there is a LOT of it, plus a look into real ranch living (as seen from the dog's point of view, of course) You will fall in love with Hank, and his pals, IF you can stand the puns."
1,racist,We listened to this story on a long car ride and I was glad my son was too young to catch the racial overtones in the material. It was full of derogatory and negative stereotypes of native people represented by coyotes. The portrayal of females was also problematic and I am disturbed to think that children are listening to this in the present day.
2,adorable series,Hank the Cowdog is a great series. My eight year old son loves to read it!So many books are written for girls. It is nice to have some written for boys.
5,Hank gets 5 Stars From Me,"The Adventures of Hank the Cowdog is a great book by John R. Ericson. The story takes place on an old ranch. It is about a dog named Hank, who is head of ranch security. Loper is his master. Loper also has another dog named Pete, who is Hank's best friend. It is funny how the author makes Hank have no idea what's going on a lot of the time, he is clueless and that's only one of the funny parts of the book. Hank gets into lots of trouble and has exciting adventures. Hank runs away and joins a wolf pack, but he comes back at the end. This is a great book. It made me laugh out loud. It's the greatest book on earth. I want to buy more Hank the Cowdog books."
5,Very Funny Book!,"The download was very quick. This was a fun book to read, the pictures are also funny to see. I recommend reading this book, and others from the series."
5,Love this book,This is a great book for kids and adults alike. I've ordered more in the series to give as gifts.
3,The Occult Sciences in Atlantis,"The Occult Sciences in Atlantis obviously subscribes to the theory that Atlantis was once the dominant world shaping civilisation that America is today. But more interestingly Spence actually attempts to prove that ancient occult traditions were all founded from this era of the Golden age. He convincingly compares the similarities of occult and magical practices between the western world, Egypt and South America. There are also interesting notes such as blue skinned people living on the Azores a few hundred years ago. Aswell as being a very readable work on the occult, although somewhat lacking proper proof and connection. It is a good source book for all aspects of the Atlantean legend."
3,Models - Collection: A cheaper way to get the songs you know,"Most people are familiar with the Models hit song, Out Of Mind Out Of Sight, off the album of the same name. That album (CD) now sells for a very high price since it has long been out of print. This CD gives you that song, plus 3 or 4 other from that album, and a mix of their other songs for a good introduction to the group. It would be nice to have the original CD re-released, as that album had several of their best songs in one package. But, in the meantime, get this collection, and enjoy some 80s Australian dance-pop.Track Listing -1. Happy Birthday I.B.M.2. Two Cabs To The Toucan3. Atlantic Romantic4. Local &/Or General5. Telstar6. Unhappy7. On8. I Hear Motion9. God Bless America10. Preacher From The Black Lagoon11. Barbados12. Cold Fever13. King Of Kings14. Big On Love15. Out Of Mind Out Of Sight16. Evolution17. Let's Kiss18. Hold On19. Oh Darling"
4,good collection,"if you like the models but wouldn't buy all their albums, this is the disc to get. a nice cross section of what the band put out over the years. if you want their best album ... imho the ""pleasure of your company"" is the album to get"
5,This was really easy to follow.,"I have been only been using Java for about a year. I tried a few other EJB books and frankly could not follow them. This book was very easy to follow. I have now created standard java beans, a few session beans, and a message bean.My only complaint, and this is a small one, is that I would have liked to have seen a few appendices explaining the various major application servers."
4,Pretty Decent Start,"I have programmed in Java for a while, and actually already knew how to do Java Beans. A friend asked me to look this over. It has strengths and weaknesses. One strength is that its really easy to read and clear. You get a really good view of the concepts on EJB. However it is weak in the coding examples. They are very simplistic. It also does not cover the server side software needed to make EJB work. My advice is that if you are new to EJB And want to get up to speed quickly read this...but then move on to a more complex book for details."
3,Got the wrong book from Total Quality Books,"I ordered the Camry manual for 1997-2001 based on the text in the product listing. I was unable to see the photo clearly that was attached to the text listing. When the book shipped it was for the 97-99 manual. I was offered a refund and it was prompt in comming. The confusing part was that the book company (not Amazon) never responded to our return request and we were unclear about the return process. To the best of our knowlege we got our refund without having to send the incorrect manual back to the book company but actually have never heard from the book company. Neither assistance, apology or offer of the correct book has come from them. Amazon has not failed me but I am not all that satisfied with the book company Total Quality Books."
5,tv mount,Arived promptly and was new in box. Universal mount had adaptors for every TV available. A++.
5,Low profile LCD TV mount of high quality & easy to install,"Indeed, a low profile LCD TV mount of high quality and easy to install. Mount came with a wide variety of screws, washers and spacers to accommodate several different attachment situations. One might need a right angle coax cable coupler because the TV is just 1.5"" from the wall.The mount's frame was just wide enough for my 42"" Panasonic. Check ahead if the mount would accommodate a larger set's mounting holes."
5,This Album Rages,"There is not too much that can be said about this masterpiece that hasn't already been said. I'm a very picky music fan and there is not a second of this cd that i don't love. The riffs are thrashy and yet pounding the whole time. Most of the Cd is super fast without being chaotic or sloppy. you can definitely hear the slayer influence but the vocals give it enough of it's own Identity (i can think of a million worse bands to be influenced by) All of this alone is enough to get as many stars as they will let me give it but then there is that x factor that these guys have that you just can't put into words. Maybe it's the rage or maybe it's the fact that they are clearly giving a big F.U. to the whole emo and oversaturated metalcore scenes that are going on right now whatever ""It"" is that makes true metalheads fall in love with a band and support them till death these guys definitely have it!"
3,typos abound,"A good basic intro to the linux kernel, pretty much exactly what I was looking for. I bought this to act as a primer before delving into Understanding the Linux Kernel, which is a much deeper and difficult work, and it's proved very satisfactory.The major problem I have is that it seems not to have been proofread AT ALL. I have found at least a typo a page on average, and not just punctuation and spelling mistakes. Using the wrong name for a function, referring the reader to the wrong figure, chapter or section, that kind of typo. The design of the book (notational conventions, typefaces, how they display varible names vs. code blocks vs. normal text, etc) is quite inconsistent at times.All in all, a good read, and a great intro, but very inconsistent and error-ridden; prepare to read it with oversight."
2,"Dull presentation, badly proofread","The views expressed in this review are based on the Filesystems chapter. The book has a very dull presentation style. Kernel structures are listed and the important lines in them are explained. The explanation lacks sufficient detail in a lot of places. It also suffers from redundant, obvious statements (conveying no information) in other places. I could also spot several mistakes; figures drawn wrong, text referring to something that is not present in the figure etc..."
4,A General History of Japan for those with No Knowledge,"This is an excellent general history for those who don't have any knowledge of Japanese history or culture. I recommend it to those white Americans who are proud to be rednecks. This book will open your mind to the fact that not all people like to drink beer, watch Nascar and generally behave like louts. After reading this book you will be impelled to read more on this country."
4,Works great with iPod Nano,"Works great with my iPod Nano, but only the older V1 and V2.Will NOT charge iPod Touch or newer Ipod Nanos.Do they plan on making a version that will?"
1,Junk,Tons of static and I have a direct line running from this into my car stereo (NOT FM TUNER). It charges fine and cuts off ipod when I turn off engine but the amount of static makes it unusable. I would have been better off with just a cheap charger for the car.
2,Not good for a line out,"I bought this product thinking that it would give me a line level out of my iPod Classic to use with the AUX input to my car stereo. The fact that it has a volume control should have tipped me off that it isn't a true line out. When I try to plug the output of the Belkin unit into the AUX port, I get really bad hum and engine noise. It's unusable that way.The one way that the Belkin unit does work is with a cassette adapter plugged into the Belkin Auto Kit. It sounds pretty good once you get the volume set to a reasonable level. Since I have an old Sidekick with a cassette deck in it, I'll just use this with a cassette adapter in that rig. I am going to try a Griffin Autopilot in my other cars, since it provides a true line out."
2,Decent performance ...Very POOR construction!!!,"I got this charger based on price, line-out, and by name. Although the thing does its job with no problems, no background or static etc. The problem is the construction of the ipod plug end...I've gone thru three of these know from the plug breaking/falling apart! good luck..."
5,Still great,"The first time I saw him play was mid 70's at the Shaboo Inn/Ct. Not sure if it is still there. Drank my first ST. Pauli Girl, which you don't forget, or so they say. I didn't.. Sitting 2 feet from the band was a blast.He is still great, more jazzy now than the early fusion style, but he can do it all. Also really liked the guitarist & bass player. Not a big fan of the steel drum in this style of music, but it worked.The Paris crowd is certainly a stiff bunch. Check out the few in the audience shots. I think the sheet music was due to a new band not totally familiar with all the music. Maybe they did not have enough rehearsal time. The sound quality was great with Stereo or Surround mix.Also remember seeing him for my bachelor party in NYC, mid 80's instead of the usually stripper nonsense. And caught him @ Yoshi's outside of SF. Can't wait to see him again."
5,Monsieur Lazhar,"A touching Canadian film about a political refugee from Algeria living and teaching in Montreal. Beautifully captures the importance of compassionate teachers in students' lives as well as the delightfully portrayed young students' perspective. The teacher's first name, Bashir, means ""the bringer of good news"" which, for once, this film also attempts to do by bridging the cultural divide between the muslim and the western experience."
5,Wonderful Movie,"If you like foreign films and their subtleties (usually not found in American films), you may well love this one. I found it to be a wonderful story about how the paths of people cross at times to help them both heal and grow. It also offered an examination of death and how different adults and different children view it and handle it emotionally. A touching film that stayed with me for some time after - which is what I like in a movie. Thoughts provoked, emotions felt, a new awareness of life for myself."
4,Really cool movie,Been a while since I've watched such a cool movie. Even though it's on French we were able to keep up ;)
3,Another Teacher Film,"If Quebec, Canada subsidized this film, they are telling people to stay away. If you are a psychologist or a psych student needing to write a paper this film may be your salvation. If you are like me and are looking for a couple of entertaining hours, find another film. The theme of shooting the whole thing is dreary surroundings and with a depressing winter ambiance is only further emphasized as the story line develops. Some of the themes - the student's parents - were cardboard cutouts made with a cookie cutter. Though I stayed with this to the end, I was relieved when it was over. The logical of the plot development seemed to have been violated when earlier hints were confirmed. The only thing I took away was that I found another depressing part of the world to avoid."
2,could not get past the third chapter,"I could not get past the third chapter because of the bad language. Who wants to read a book that contains worse language than a rated ""R"" movie?"
2,lots more water than lotion,when received water was floating on top of lotion....even when removed the surface water more water than lotion was noted...no scent at all....when applied very runny and not moisturizing....will not purchase again....
2,"Has bad chemicals, would have liked it otherwise","I like the feel and scent of this lotion and it does not leave me feeling greasy whatsoever. It does have a lot of good, natural, plant-based essential oils and good stuff. However, it also has a lot of bad ingredients in it. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), Parabens, and other bad stuff. Seeing as how these are mostly (but not 100%) in the product listing - I've only just been reading about these chemicals as of recent. If I had researched this before I saw this product, then I wouldn't have bought it. Oh well."
1,DANGER,"Besides other potentially harmful ingredients, this product contains Comfrey, which is a known liver toxin EVEN WHEN only applied to the skin (especially over a long period of time). Physicians warn severely against even topical application of this substance. I would avoid this moisturizer until they get rid of obvious toxins that shouldn't even be applied to the skin, like this one."
5,Good film for fashion class,"I teach fashion to high school students grades 10-12. This was a great video to use. It portrayed how much of an impact films/movies, actors and actresses have on what we wear, the current styles, trends, designs, etc. The students really enjoyed it, especially since they use popular, well known actors and actresses that we can all relate to."
2,Vapid Talking Heads,"This movie would be great if it were edited down to 15 minutes. Most of it is talking heads going on and on about this designer or that trend. The blurb indicated that it would deal with Edith Head, costumes in film,etc. That takes up about ten minutes, and it merely shows a photo of Ms. Head. It doesn't deal with the iconic elements of her designs. The rest looks like those MTV fillers where actors and unrecognizable ""fasion experts"" give their preferences and opinions. I showed it to my film class and was embarrassed by the lack of information and the vapid way in which it was delivered. I wanted to fast forward through the first 30 minutes, but I kept hoping it would get better. There have to be better movies about costumes and fashion in film. I'm still searching."
5,Fashion In Film,I love this documentry because it's has a female narrator and Rachel Zalis film deubt. I love Rachel Zalis because I love her voice a lot.
3,"A Good, Not Great, Movie Until the Final Scenes","I had great hopes for this movie, not only before watching it but virtually all the way through the story. Then, in the last scene comes a twist that makes all the previous movie seem confusing. I thought it was a fantasy, or a 'Heaven-can-wait' movie, but the last scene completely upsets that notion. It certainly has a good fantasy premise, that someone comes back from someplace in time to help someone on earth avoid mistakes that could ruin his life. All I can say is that you may watch this movie and try to figure it out for itself.Also, on the DVD I had to watch, for a long time in the middle of the movie there is a very annoying background chatter of some men talking. At first, I thought it was a background radio in the scene, but it keeps going way beyond one scene. I even took out the DVD and started over, but that chatter continued in that portion. This, also, grades the movie down a grade."
3,Will Z.T. Get Home?,"It's a low-budget, sometimes melodramatic, but beneficial movie exploring the problem of cheating. My favorite scenes are any with Monique Edwards, who plays an exemplary teacher, and the scenes where Robert Loggia interacts with John Amos or Craig T. Nelson."
3,Against Time,"I was really hoping to discover an overlooked gem when I ordered this movie. Robert Loggia does his best to carry the film, but he's not given enough dialog or plot to support his histrionics. Craig T. Nelson delivers a most surprising turn as an indifferent father, and it was good to see John Amos again, even in a throwaway role with no meat to chew on. The youngsters are enthusiastic and sincere, but all in all it comes across as nothing more than a low-budget, lightweight TV movie that may end up best remembered as one of Loggia's final starring performances."
5,A great product for men who are new to the Bible,I bought this Bible for my husband and he absolutely loves it! The shipper did a great job of packaging it and sending it along in a timely way. A great purchase all the way around!
3,Decent bible for a small price,"I wouldn't consider this a fantastic or a keepsake bible, but it is practical and has some good reflections for men in it. The index is very lacking in functionality and completeness. If you are looking for something basic, this is good."
3,T. H. White,"The Once and Future King is such a wonderful groups of stories - I think one of the best books ever written. I wondered what the author was like - so I read Sylvia Townsend Warner's biography of T. H. White. Warner was a really good writer, so the book is enjoyable to read, but not really informative about White. The main thing that most readers might want to know - how he came to write his masterpiece - isn't really clarified. Warner gives a lot of detail about White's adult life, from his letters, diaries, and friends, but it's mainly a report of his drinking or not drinking, hunting or not hunting, mention of his books, his efforts to learn new skills, mostly sporting and mostly not successful. There is some mention of the effort he went to in order to understand the characters in his books, and some interesting detail about his work with deaf mute people."
5,An easy favorite,My son absoutely loves this book. It's very rhythmical and silly. He usually wants me to read it twice!
3,redundant but fun,"I like most of his books but if you have one you have them all. It is also important to follow the age guidelines on these books. Younger children don't get the ""joke""."
5,Cute Book,My early reader loves these books! They are quite funny and really make you think about some of the things kids hear and how they interpret them.
3,Humor needed,"I bought this book thinking it would be hilarious. Knowing that we would love it, my children and I read the book for a bedtime story that night. Needless to say, they were not impressed. The only part they liked was the gross part about the brain coming out(of his nose). The concept was cute about the belly button fuzz making the little boy thinking he was falling apart but it just didn't have the kick it needed to make you laugh. Sorry but this is definitely not a book I will be keeping around forever. Want it?? :)"
3,"Disgusting, but educational.","If you have just eaten, this book would not be the best to read as a bedtime story. However, it was good for my son, David, who wasn't quie grasping the concept of how he stays in one piece. It was somewhat funny, and I'm glad that I got it for my son, and not me."
5,Parts (of the body),"This book is a delightful one to have in the house in case you have small visitors. It is fun to read to them and watch the expressions on their faces. A friend introduced me to the book that she had purchased for her grandchildren and they take it out first thing when they come to visit. Now mine do the same.As you read along, the little boy learns about all the different parts of the body that we lose. He begins to wonder if he is going to have everything fall off or get lost. It is, as I said, amusing to watch the expressions on the children's faces as you read and they begin to wonder, as well. The dialogue is presented in an interesting way and it is a good way to open up discussions and answer questions that children might not think to ask otherwise."
5,Fantastic!!!!,This Book Is Fantastic For For Any Child That Is Going Through The Growing Stage. Very Funny And Will Even Make Any Adult Laugh. Highly Recommend :)
5,Absolutely delightful!,Parts by Tedd Arnold is a delightful story of a little boy who thinks he is falling apart. The story is perfect for parents and teachers to use with children to help them understand the many changes that their bodies will go through even at an early age. The illustrations are hilarious and add humor to the already funny text.
3,A person thinks his body is falling apart.,"I liked this book beause it was funny. Everthing was coming off his body,for example, his hair,fuzz,and Skin.he thought his life was over.Read this book to find out for yourself if his life was really over.A Reader from Ballston Lake, New York, June 15,1999 9 years old"
2,Gross and Boring,"I bought this book from the Scholatsic Book Club thinking that it would be a funny book for me and my daughter to read together. We were both disappointed and bored after the first two pages. If your children find gross and taboo stories funny, I guess this book would be for you."
5,Easy Piano Book A Goddess-send for Less Advanced Players,"I've been a Tori Amos fan ever since I was eleven and always wanted to be able to play her music, but her being the excellent musician she is, it was difficult for me to play out of her existing music books. The music isn't really easy, but it is manageable for all the fans with less musical expertise than she has, which is probobly the vast majority. I'm really glad she came out with this, because even more so than most musicians, her music needs to be simplified (but not dumbed down) for all her fans to play."
2,A bit disappointing overall,"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the lack of facts in this book. The author does a very good job narrating a story about the main characters, but the book could have done with significantly less editorializing. For anyone reasonably familiar with the tech industry, only a couple of chapters will be really interesting - specifically the ones that deal with the departures of some of the senior execs and technologists.I would recommend that you rent this book from your locallibrary rather than purchase it."
4,A well crafted diversion,"LOOKING GLASS LIVES may take Picano readers by surprise in that it is not his usual foray into the world of Men with Men. This is a marvelous short book that would satisfy even the most finicky of Romance/Mystery/Intrigue lovers. Once Picano seduces you into knowing the inner thinking of these interesting people and their crossing of lines/lives, he has you to the end of the story. Little is said of the artwork included (illustrations, if you will), but for me they recall the look of the old fashioned Romance novels of the 40's and add signifcantly to the success of this delicious little book."
4,Loved it,"Saw Ana live in Wheeling,WV and she did all these tunes and more.She Looks good,sounds good and she is very plesant.She signed autographs for a couple of hours.Give it a listen."
3,Just OK,"I'm not nearly as enthusiastic about this one as previous reviewers. Ana does have a unique approach to the blues, & that may be a good or bad thing depending on your perspective. Her sound is based as much on jazz, funk & rock as it is on the blues. You won't find any slow blues in the classic sense on this album. In addition, I'd only consider her a so-so vocalist. But my biggest problem here is the song ""Navajo Moon"", a song she introduces as one she wrote as a ""tribute"" to Stevie Ray Vaughan & Ronnie Earle. The tune has more than a passing resemblance to Vaughan's own ""Riviera Paradise"", with some ""Little Wing"" thrown in for good measure. If you want true blues-rock, stick with Bonamassa, Shepherd, etc."
3,Classic Reggae Album With Just Average Sound,Third World's well produced 1st album is unfortunately marred by average sound. Too bad the Japanese did a poor remastering of this classic album. My old scratched up record even sounds better. This is one of those rare occasions where the Japanese remaster is badly done. I have an audiophile entertainment system so this might sound alright on moderate to less expensive systems. There's an abundance of bonus tracks which includes their hits making this a good long CD. But about $30 is a lot to pay on Amazon for an average recording. If you can live with just an average recording and like this album then it's the only available copy. Hopefully someone in the future will do it right.
4,Interesting French pop,"While living in Europe I have been searching for music that goes beyond the pop mold. Believe me, it is pretty hard to find. This disc is an exception: well-written interesting music that is NOT a Celine Dion clone. If you are looking for some beautiful French female vocals with interesting pop/rock arrangements, check this one out...."
3,TYPOs R US,Purchased this book from Amazon.com in the Kindle format. Cannot enjoy it because of soooooo many typos. I stopped counting at 50 -- and that was just in the first 200 pages.Has anyone else had the same experience with a different book?
2,Miles for those who can't take the heat,"Oh dear. I wonder who would buy this? Miles Davis, the greatest experimenter in jazz history, is shown here as a person who is a bit of a sell out; someone who makes jazz tailored for the smooth jazz market. But the act is that was simply not true. With this disc you don't get the whole story! And worse still, I don't think people are going to make a ""Harsh Miles"" to complement this one. Sure you get some of his best work, but this only focusses on his first quintet/sextet and his later fusion outings. Where is stuff ""In A Silent Way"" and some of his second quintet's outings??????Stay clear away from this unless you are a cowardly smooth jazz fan."
3,Fair battery,It's great they charge in 15 minutes but for the money the Rayovac hybrid batteries are a better deal to me. These batteries leak down rather quick as do most rechargeable batteries. The only exceptions I know of are the Rayovac and Sony Eneloop hybrid batteries. They maintain 80% of their charge over 6 months. I've never had to recharge one of they hybrids because it was sitting in a drawer when I needed it unlike these. I almost always have to recharge these when I need them. I pop them in my battery tester and they almost always show low after a week or so. I find it annoying I have to charge them to use them. I think I'll buy the hybrids from now on.
5,"Good batteries, buy them if you can!","I have been using these batteries for 6 years now and I love them, I wish I could give more stars. I am sad they discontinued them, I wish I bought more, I am desperately searching for more of them! They Work very well in many devices, charge very quickly for when you use them and still need them quickly, stay charged for long period for us lazy types that charge and forget about them for a week/month--They are still charged and ready to use! I paid about $16 for 4 AA and $35 for a 15min charger, similar price still at $18 for 4 AA. Should have bought more of them, never needed to until now, I need them in multiple devices at once. Great buy, will almost completely replace your need to buy batteries. Take it from me, I haven't bought any for 6 years!!"
5,Sorry they're discontinued,"The last time I bought batteries was when I picked up my Rayovac 15-minute charger about ten years ago. Any other battery purchases were made in a pinch when I was away from home and the charger. Rechargeable batteries TOTALLY save money. 10-15 bucks now, prevents batteries in the landfill and 4-5 bucks every time standard batteries run out. It's GREAT!"
1,Don't buy!!!,"Had these for awhile now (at least a year). They charge up, but only last a short time in what ever you put them in (flashlight, radio etc.), and if you charge them and let them sit, in a couple of weeks they are almost completely dead and will only last 2 min. in use. HAD PROBLEMS WITH THESE GUYS!"
2,Bad product,"I am using these batteries for my wireless mouse. After hours of charging, they last just one day of occasional uses!!!"
3,Great little battries.,"Great batteries here! Being able to charge these things up in 15 minutes ON THE JOB is a live savor! Came in handy for almost 2 years. However on the 3rd year they started running out of juice EXTREMELY fast within a few days EVEN IF WE DIDN'T USE THE BATTERIES!WTF! Great batteries, but only have a few years life in them it seems and I purchased almost a dozen of them."
3,Great batteries,I purchase these batteries.the price was great they arrives quick the only thing is that it took longer then 15min to charge
3,its good to go!,"for the price.... 4pcs for less than 8 bucks, its a good deal!its fast charging however for the same brand of charger only,i used a different brand of charger, but it was not that too long of a wait..."
3,"Good, but...",These batteries will actually loose their charge...I would go with different batteries.
1,Terrible!,"I ordered this book in hopes to have more ideas for salads. This book was terrible, The ingredients are outrageous, and the preparation too long! The book was also poorly organized. To me salads can be simple but spectacular. This book made them so exotic, I had to check the cover to ensure it was entitled ""salads"". I am an amateur chef and this book has insired me to write a cookbook! I sent this book back!"
5,No more banging!,Most of our toilets are Toto but we have a few that are not. Was fed up with guests banging the seats down so was quite surprised to find that the Toto's seats fit other manufacturer's bowls. Converted all my remaining toilets over to Toto. Definitely the way to go.
2,Cheaply made.,I replaced a Kohler French Curve seat with this one. The Toto seat is made much more cheaply. It squeaks constantly when sitting on it.
1,Very poor quality,"We bought this to go with our new Toto toilet. This seat is very poor quality and obvious when you open the package. It is loosely assembled and has the quality of a cheap ""made in China"" plastic toy."
3,works well but not for long,"I had a bathroom remodelled a few years ago and a Toto toilet with this seat was installed. I loved it, but it only lasted 3 years with VERY light use as it's a guest's bathroom: the ""springs"" on the upper closure went so it slammed shut like a traditional lid so I expect to buy another 3 years from now."
3,Great while it lasts!,"They start out great, but we've had to replace ours about every 2 years! Then it slams down just like every other toilet lid. Replacement gets old, and each time we order a new one (we have three Toto toilets) the price goes up considerably."
4,It's a seat,The seat works well and installs as described. The price is a bit high and should really be lower for this type of product.
1,looks arn't everything,"When I first got this camera I thought it was a great camera because of its looks, size, and price. Then after trying to take pictures, I realized it was a piece of crap. It was missing a major part of a good camera- photo taking. The pictures it took were washed out by the flash and almost everything about the camera was bad quality. I tried everything to get a good picture out of it, but it never took one good picture indoors. I'm currently returning it and will never get another Oregon camera. I have two words for that camera ""bad quality""."
1,doesn't work at all,tried to install driver on my windows vista and windows xp; didn't work.i'm returning this product!!
3,"Mellow, but not memorable","On the surface this CD sounds similar to the Renaissance of the 1970's, which is most welcome compared to how they left us in the 80's, but I find few songs that stick in my head even after several listenings.It sounds similar to how a best of Renaissance CD would have sounded if they had compiled all their weaker songs from their 70's albums.On the plus side, Annie's vocals still shine. The problem is I kept on expecting her to suddenly start singing Celene Dion's ""My heart will go on"" or something like that. It's easy to like this CD, but hard to love it."
2,Sounds similar but falls short of haunting,"I missed any mention that they were getting together and making a new album. I am a big fan 30+ years. I even liked some of Annie's solo work. With these great orchestrations it just seems to miss the mark. Not sure why, its not haunting no songs stick in your head that you want to listen to over and over. Maybe over produced or they were striving TOO hard to sound like they did. Oh well, glad I bought if even though it will end up in my collection only to be shown to friends who didn't know about it.Thanks"
3,The voice remains crystal clear,"A good collection of short ballads, far from the best work of the group, but the harmonies packaged by the voice of Annie Haslam are pleasant to hear."
3,An Annie solo album,"Nice music, terrible lyrics (""Dolphin's Prayer"" and ""Life in Brazil"" are especially excreable), great vocals. If you're expecting something like the early Renaissance, you'll be disappointed. However, if you like Annie's solo albums, you'll like this. It's light, new-age music which doesn't challenge much. Annie's voice is great, but she doesn't show off her range much."
1,This is a mellow pop album,"If you are looking for classical passages that inspired their music in the 70's, forget it. In fact, there is only ONE SONG with an instrumental passage (One Thousand Roses) and it is not very long.The direction of this album picks up from their 80's work. I would compare this to ""Songs From Renaissance Days."" This is closer to an Annie Haslam solo album. If you like that, then you will like this. But this is far from ""Turn Of The Cards"" or even ""A Song For All Seasons.""And this time, we can't blame Jon Camp!"
2,The things I did in the 70's,"Used to love listening to this band back in the 70's Listening to them now makes me realized just how stoned we all were. I think the songswere not produced well. Her voice still sounds the same, but I think I must of outgrown the sound, the music didn't flow well, not the same astheir classic ""Jeckle & Hyde"""
1,BURNED CD,"This really was the body of the evidence, this CD it's sold by a site called ArkivMusik, a third partner in the AmazonMarketPlace, if you expect a new CD factory sealed, forget it, you will receive a BURNED CD...if you want only one, they ship 3 copies of the same, if you don't want a real headache, let it pass..., this Mercury Recording it wasn't conducted by Bernard Herrmann.There is a re-recording on Varese Saravande Label"
4,Choosing to stop futile suffering,"What was vaguely addressed in this book was that suicide because of depression or mental problems is a very poor choice and should not be the first option but euthanasia for those suffering agonizing, debilitating illness should be a choice made when the mind of the victim is still lucid enough to make such a final decision. If you were in excruciating pain from which there was no relief, bedridden, and no hope for any quality of life ever, you might give this book 5 stars. In that situation, you would fully understand why ending life may be the very best thing to do for yourself. I deducted one star because the problem of suicide because of depression needed to be further discussed and discouraged more strongly."
1,Recipe for tragedy...,"This book is an ode to death; a manual for self-deliverance, even for those who are not terminally ill it offers some very lucrative suggestions. One year ago my friend took his own life, he was only 32 yrs. old with no terminal illness. He had mentioned Derek Humphrey's methods as very ""cool ideas"". So, if you or someone you know would like the easy way out, then definetly read this book. If you would like to live a while longer and offer hope to those suffering rather than the quickest exit possible, you may want to choose a more uplifting book."
1,Authorza Douchebag`,"What a sad excuse for a book. Mr. Humphry, why don't you try being a man and follow through on some of the sick advice you are dispensing?"
3,Graphics do NOT look like picture!,"The blanket is soft & hopefully will be durable for a college student. OK to use for decoration or sit on at a football game, not for being cozy. The picture on the blanket does not show up as in the ad, colors are not as vivid. Would have returned it if it has not been asked for as a gift. Overpriced"
3,"Overrated, & Ian MacKellan was robbed of a Best Actor Oscar","I liked the first half of this film best - a gentle romantic comedy. It was amusing, tho not hysterically funny, Benigni did his best here, and things were believable. But once they were carted away to a camp (death? concentration? labor? POW?), things become quite unrealistic and inconsistent. The little boy would have been gassed ASAP after arrival at the camp. The camp would have been much more crowded & filthy. Hiding a child in the barracks all day was not an option - the guards would have found him easily. And how does Benigni get to wander around camp after curfew without an armed guard or without getting shot? OK then gentle readers, if this was more like a dream/morality fable, then Benigni & the writers should have gone more the other way: images of ghosts or angels, a ballet thru the camp. Otherwise, the camp is much too nice & believability goes right out the window. I had expected more after all the hoopla..."
1,I'm amazed,"I'm amazed at how many high marks this movie has been given. I could tolerate about 30 minutes of it before turning it off. I felt that the acting was second rate, the actor's line were idiotic and unrealistic, and if my dad talked the way this dad did in the movie to his child, I would have avoided him at all cost if I were the child.Just because this tells a story of Jewish people having to deal with Nazi death camps, it doesn't mean it has any real value to it. Save your money and get something that is more realistic and not as corny as this."
1,unreal,"Saw this one on television. Scenery and costuming are pretty good. But overall I really don't care for it. There really is nothing funning about the Holocost. Indeed the scene best showing this is when the child of the main character is briefly lead away by an Aufseherin. She is wearing a starched clean white nanny apron over her uniform complete with black boots, her face devoid of warmth; which pretty much describes the reality of this film."
3,not much sadness,"Not what i expected, it seemed more of a comedy, i know he was doing it for his child sake for him not to be frighten but for me,i'm affraid its not my cup of tea. Schindler's List is my top preference"
5,One Of My Very Favorites!,"This is easily one of the best movies ever made. I honestly don't know how they were able to make a movie so funny, touching, and powerful all at the same time. I love every aspect of it."
5,great movie,"this movie is not only in one of the most beautiful langauges there is, but it is also a great story of hope in the midst of crisis. its got everything, comedy, love, thoughts on life. the kid is truly great with his expressions."
5,Outstanding!,"Probably the best film I've seen in my life. It has everything... a very original plot, humour, pathos, love & harsh reality. The period has also been captured beautifully. A once-in-a-lifetime creation. Mr.Benigni will find it very difficult to make a film like this again."
5,BEST FOREIGN MOVIE IN MY LIFE!!,This is the best movie that I've seen in my life. This movie tells us how our life are so vivid and amazing.Actually it's first time to see Itarian movie. This movie makes me to want to see more Itarians.
5,Phenomenal movie with a positive story of hope.,"Life Is Beautiful manipulates the magnificent language of Italian, together with a great cast to make it one of the best movies of all time. Lost in the story line, one is able to forget the subtitles and the horror of the World War II concentration camp and focus on the beauty of life. This film is a must see for all who love a little romance, combined with a little adventure and desire to remember what makes it true: Life is Beautiful."
5,Life is Beautiful,"Ohmigod,if I had to choose one Roberto Benigini movie, it'd would have to be Life is Beautiful. After this movie, I did realize that life really is beautiful. This movie is about Gweeno...the main character. He keeps bumping into Dora, a schoolteacher. They soon marry and have a son, who they named, Joshua. On Joshua's birthday, Gweeno and his son are taken to a concentration camp. Dora finds out and wants to be taken to the camp as well. At the end of the movie, Gweeno dies and Joshua gets his wish to ride in a tank...how beautiful.."
1,Not in English as stated!,This was a gift for my father who does not like subtitles so I purchased the copy that was supposed to voiced over in English- however it was not.
5,In reply to MRD...,"After reading MRD's review I had to give my two cents on the subject!If you think that the idea of the movie was to ridicule what life was like in a concentration camp during WWII, think again, and watch the movie one more time 'cause you mustn't have paid attention the first time.I see the characters portraied in this movies as heroes. The perception I got out of it was one of the highest respect (on the part of Benigni) for all those who went to great lenghts trying to survive the horrors they were put through on a daily basis, sometimes offering themselves for the ultimate sacrifice to protect each other and/or their loved ones.The bitter smiles during the ""funny"" parts of the movie did nothing but reinforce the feeling of outrage and sadness we all feel (or should feel) when thinking of that.It's a marvelous movie!A celebration of life!Bravo Roberto!!!"
5,This film shows what love can inspire you to do!,"Benigni's character is one of love, hope, and joy. The wonderful romance of capturing his wife to be's heart is followed by his demonstration of what love for life, family, and people can inspire you to do. His courage came through his comedy, and made us all believe that life is beautiful if you look at it through the heart as well as the eyes! Grazie et grazie Roberto!!!!"
5,"Incredible, one of the best ever!!","I went and saw this movie several times. I first saw it at an artsy theatre here in the city before it recieved all the media attention. But it deserved every bit of praise that it has recieved. I am not sure how someone could not like this film. It is just what it says it is beautiful. I was the best film of 1998 and should have won the best picture of the year without a doubt. It was a refreshing escape from Hollywood trash. Benigni was fresh and exciting and brillant in all the roles he had in this movie(director,actor and producer). It is great, just great. A must see. It will change you."
5,The best movie of 1998,"Life is beautiful is a masterpeice. It is intelligant, humorous and deeply moving. Benigni is an absolute genius. Don't be turned off by the subtitles. I was reluctant to see it; but was happy to actually see a movie worthy of six dollars and two hours of my time. Unlike many movies that are released this is quality entertainment without the trash. See this movie. It will be worth your time."
5,"An amazing, touching, tear-jerking film","I loved La Vita E Bella. I started crying in the middle 'til 3 hours afterwards. It was touching, and although it was not true to life, not all movies on the Holocaust have to mimic Schindler's List. It was beautifully written and funny at the same time, while also maskingly showing the horror of the Holocaust. We all know what happened, and Benigni did well in not showing the bony or the dead bodies. There is nothing wrong with depicting hope in what was a hopeless situation."
1,Lack of Special Features,"I'm not happy with this edition, it's the cut edition re-edited by Roberto Benigni for the Acadamy Awards presentation, compared to the uncut italian Blu-ray which presents the original uncut version released for first italian release before the Academy awards. OK, Miramax hasn't got the rights for the italian cut, but the worst thing is the italian release has also a lot of extras, including the Academy Awards ceremony footage (such a footage had been recorded in USA) which is omitted in this release."
2,Weak,"I would not recommend this movie. Not homogeneous. Beginning and end belong to two different movies. Ok, the last scene was touching and some of the scenes were quite engaging but overall I did not enjoy it that much."
4,This movie makes life really beautiful,"This movie is just great. The movie is a funny philosophical one that deals with the question of ""Beautiful life"". Benigni wanted to make a statement that life is beautiful only as long as people see it is beautiful. He emphasis this by using a dramatic story of a jew who was sent to one of those Nazis WWII camps with his family. Despite the horrible situation, he just make fun of it and provided the most interesting and funny days for his young son.Then why i am giving him 4-stars... just because of the final seen (The american tank) ... it is not out of the scope of the movie, but i just didn't like it.."
5,The most meaningful movie I have ever seen!,"I am reminded of the words of Leo Tolstoy: ""The secret to being happy is to be..."" ""Life is Beautiful"" is about living a passionately happy life which makes others see the beauty of it. This movie is so Beautiful!"
5,Life is Beautiful no matter where you are coming from...,"I personally enjoyed this movie a lot. Benigni is so incredibly smooth that any guy who watches him would probably want to take notes. Benigni's character of Guido is set so far beyond superficial. Throughout the entire movie he kept the same optimistic and charming character despite the background of being placed in a concentration camp. He goes above and beyond the role of ""superdad"" which makes this movie even more touching. He is a miracle worker who shows you that ""Life is Beautiful."""
5,The Best Movie Ever!,"This is a truly brilliant, touching, heart-wrenching film. You don't really mind the subtitles after a while, and Benigni is a comic genius.I have heard people say that this film makes light of the holocaust, but it really is just a father going to great lengths to try to protect the innocence of his son.It is deserving of all the awards it has earned.A must see for all!"
1,Obscene!,Caligula is an obscene movie for what it shows. Life is Beautiful is an obscene movie because it sugar-coats and doesn't show the horrors and atrocities of Nazism. Never forget!
2,Ernest Goes To A Concentration Camp,The worst thing about this movie is the stock phrases and now-meaningless cliches it made so many of you use to praise its invisible virtues.
2,Do not see unless you want your heart ripped out,"I'm in the minority of people who hard a very hard time with this movie. Yes, there was much that I appreciated about it, especially the magical romance in the first half. When the action moved to the concentration camp, I wish I had followed my gut instinct and turned the movie off then and there.Setting the rest of this movie in a concentration camp just ddoesn't work for me. I cannot ignore the knowledge that great cruelty and unimaginable suffering occured in places like this.If you are a sensitive person, I suggest you skip this movie. It'll rip your heart out by making you care so deeply about the characters and then.... well I don't want to give away the ending. Let's just say, I was left very sad, NOT uplifted at all."
1,Are Oscars Given Out By Amoeba,"Sorry everyone but I thought this was a real turkey shoot. The humour was contrived, hammy & very lame. I guess my major reason for disliking this film was as a consequence of Benigni being both the egotistical director & star. He certainly gave himself centre stage. While his screen & real life wife was obsequiously adoring & dippy, & his screen son was just a mail-order doll for pathos. Roberto was a totally foolish character, who was unable to raise any empathy with me. We don't actually get to see who shoots Roberto - but I would be more than happy to admit to pulling the trigger.The fact that this farce was set during the infamous holocaust was not a problem for me - but clearly offensive to some people. I suspect that people who cried during this film, would also have cried during ""Pretty Woman"". As both films make a fairytale out of a harsh reality."
4,Life Is Beautiful,"""Life Is Beautiful"" ranks as one of the best pictures of the modern era. Roberto Benigni's talents for comedy, drama and filmmaking allow this film to walk the delicate line of a comedy set at the Holocaust.The DVD also comes with a featurette, theatrical trailers and the ability to watch the film in either Italian or English. The English version of the film allows you to enjoy all the details in the film.For the collector of cinema masterpieces, this is a must add to your collection."
5,Incredible. One of my all time favorites,"Great story, great acting, great score, what more can you ask. A true classic in every sense of the word."
5,La vita e bella,This movie truely explores the beauty of life. Don't be scared by having to read subtitles. The movie is truely uplifting.
5,One of the best movies of 1998,I love this movie.The first time I saw it i cried and the second time I saw it I cried more it is just beatiful and it made us see that life is beutiful it just depends the way you see things.
5,WONDERFUL movie!!!!!!!!,"This movie is literally one of the best films I have ever seen. It is touching, funny, and beautiful. I've seen some reviewers complain about the lack of graphic violence, saying that its absence is ""sugar-coating"" the reality of nazi death camps. However, I find that the film is just as effective without it. One of its other selling points is that it isn't too long. Most movies with this subject matter are way too long and tend to drag on endlessly. I enthusiastically recommend this movie to everyone. Just a note for anyone wary of a movie with subtitles: I watched it in Italian with English subtitles and didn't find them at all distracting."
5,Love beyond measure.,"I was almost determined not to like this movie based on the clownish antics of Benigni at the Academy Awards. However, he made this silliness pull off magic in this tender love story. The most heart-tugging thing about this movie is that it is beyond a love story, in the romantic sense. The man loved his son so much that he wanted to protect him from the atrocities going on around him. The charade is a complete success, as was this man's life. He never gave up hope for his wife or his child. This movie leaves you cheering, crying, and wanting to give your child a huge hug and never let go. You will re-evaluate your own priorities."
2,This clown got two oscars for this?,"Bad acting, mundane script and beautiful cinematography should not be so rewarded. He beat out Nolte in 'Affliction' - give me a break.Guess if Roberto does not give the missus a job she is not working.Neither funny enough or harrowing.There are plenty of good movies out there. Go see them!"
1,Simply Pathetic,"Life is beautiful was the most ridiculous movie I ever saw in my whole life, and I'm not young. The actings are terrible, and Roberto didn't deserved that award. He's just a clown. The ending scene, is funny for being so pathetic, and only a person with serious bad taste would enjoy it."
4,"Review For ""Life Is Beautiful""","Even though this movie is funny here and there, it is quite flat. The movie is meant to be a Comedy, but all it is really, is joking about the darkest, most terrible time in the 20th history. I still give it a 4 star though, because some parts of it where, I must say, hillarious. The end is a little sad, although not really. The charecters are quite intresting, but the story is pretty flat. It is funny, though, hillarious. So dont watch this movie if you expect to see this tear jerking, grim movie about World War 2."
5,Extraordinarily touching--near perfect cinema,"This film is so affecting, so vividly real that one could go in knowing the story completely and still be moved. I've heard criticisms that the first half was slow or disjointed. Don't you believe it. The first half is sweet and real and sets up the pain and glory of the second half. The concept itself is unbelievable--that Benigni pulls it off is sheer triumph. This is no syrupy-sweet story of good over evil. It is a chilling, haunting fable of faith and love and hope over almost unendurable doom. A film like this appears once in a lifetime. To hear criticisms of this film is like hearing criticisms of my children. I take both personally. See it."
5,A Masterpiece. Say no more.,"I put this movie next to wonderful films such as ""Il Postino"" and ""Cinema Paradiso"". How do Italians make such delightful movies?"
4,"Excelent movie,","After requesting the movie we thought that could take over 10 days, it only took 4 days. The movie is great, we really enjoyed."
5,Powerful movie! Must See!,This movie will make you cry in the best way possible.It celebrates the triumph of the human spirit in the face of enormous adversity!
5,Wonderful!,"This movie deserves to be watched in Italian. The beautiful sound of the language puts your mind in a setting that makes the english subtitles almost disappear. How this movie could be a comedy about the Holocaust, but still hold room for a tearful ending is beyond me. All I know is that the filmakers did a splendid job with this film."
5,Left me speechless,"As Roberto Benigni accepted the Academy Award for this movie, it illustrated that there was something very special going on - so much so that I immediately made sure to add it to the list of movies I had to watch, thought I had no idea what it was about and had not even heard of it until that moment. Unfortunately it was a very long time until I did so.Though most movies will simply play through and leave little impression, this one continues to stay with me, even though I have not watched it for some time, and I suspect that it will continue to do so. I only wonder if they will ever add Benigni's performance at the Oscar's to the DVD extras. That would be about the only way to improve on what is already nearly perfect."
5,Life is really beautiful,"This awesome movie was nominated for several awards and won 3. Among them, Best foreign movie and best actor. Highly recommend it"
5,Life is Beautiful,"If we could all view life in the way this main character, did, LIFE WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL, always!!!!!!!! Story inspires hope and the deepest love a person can offer. Even in the face of ""hell"" God's pressence was kept alive by the power of ONE man. An inbelievable film. A MOST SEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,It was alright,"This movie was alright, but it is by no means as good as everyone says it is. I didn't think it was funny at all, and it was unrealistic. I mean, in the real holocaust, little kids knew they were in an awful place. There is no way that one of them would thought it was just a ""game"". The movie made the holocaust seem like nothing. I mean, if a Nazi was gonna shoot a prisoner, he would just do it, he wouldn't take the guy to a deserted corner to do it, like they did with this movie. If you wanna see a funny movie, watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off. If you wanna see a REALLY good movie, go see The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Spartucus, To Kill a Mockingbird, Shadow of Dought, Ran(or any other film by Akira Kurosawa or whatever his name was)etc., etc."
1,It's a still life,benini in this film does to the audience exactly what his character does to his son - he shields the viewer from the horror of the holocaust. whether this is just deluded or pernicious (benini turning one of the greatest tragedies in human history into comic schtick) is not for me to say. But the film is dishonest as they come. Life wasn't beautiful in the Holocaust and for the people who survived it there wasn't a happy ending. go read Primo Levi instead.
1,Appallingly overrated,"This film should have been titled ""My Ego Is Beautiful."" The so-called gags are weak and uninspired and, for a film that purports to be about the triumph of the human spirit blah blah blah, Begnini's character displays very little interest in any other people beyond himself. The unrealistic depiction of the concentration/extermination/labor camp actually undercuts the resonance of the ""humor"" in the second half. Had the filmmakers chosen to depict the dehumanizing horror of a real camp accurately, Begnini's mugging might have had a truly tragicomic effect. But setting the film in a camp in which Jewish children are allowed to live instead of being murdered on arrival and in which a prisoner is allowed to roam about unsupervised merely reduced the contrast between horror and comedy to the level of a Hogan's Heroes rerun. For a good Italian comedy about the Holocaust and WWII, rent Wrtmuller's Seven Beauties instead."
3,"Excellent, but not the best","A brilliantly executed plot, but not even half as good as either ""Night of the Shooting Stars"" or ""Seven Beauties"""
5,Amazing!,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I do not recommend that you get the one dubbed in English. Hearing the Italian with the sub-titles only adds to the charm of the movie! This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over and still notice things that you haven't seen before. It is a very clever movie. After about 5 minutes you forget all about the sub-titles.
5,Wonderful Story,"This is a very gripping story that deserved the awards it won and was nominated for. It centers around a Jewish man's journey through Nazi occupation and concentration camp while trying to keep his young son from being traumatized and to keep him alive. Comedy is wonderfully worked in despite the dark theme and issues involved. The movie does a good job of presenting the dark side of the concentration camps without dwelling on them or being overly gory. Best of all, the plot is not very predictible, as it very well could have been.Wonderful directing, above average acting, and incredible writing make for an excellent film that any teenager or older should see."
5,Not to be questioned,"I noticed that some people were confused with events that occured during the film. After living in Naples, Italy for 2 years, all of these events were perfectly normal to me. Of course, most American's will not understand every part of this film. But on the other hand, this movie was not made for an American audience. So before you criticize this film, think about the differences between the Italian culture and our own."
5,My #1 Favorite Movie,"I LOVE this movie. You will not regret watching or purchasing this movie -- it is a classic. It's bittersweet, so don't expect to laugh the entire time (though you will for a good portion of it). Only watch it with mature children.Oh how I love this movie."
5,GREAT foreign movie!,"This movie has to be one of the best foreign movies I've ever seen. It's easy to follow (especially if you know your history) and it always makes me cry!! It has everything you want in a great movie: Love, drama, comedy, and history."
5,A lovely film,"I just watched the film for the first time and I have decided that I will purchase it and watch it from time to time.A romantic film mixed with great humor in the good times and the bad times of the Nazi War Camp make it an exceptional film that is very different. It is filled with joy, laughter and tragedy which make it very emotional.I can't believe the people that knock this film because of displaying humor in a Nazi War Camp. I see nothing wrong with having some humor in a horrible situation.Guido displays a great zest for life. The humor in this film makes it great and I love his devoutness and love that he has for his wife and child."
2,Not English Version,"Wasn't English version as advertised . . . It was instead the English version with subtitles. I don't know if the English version exists, but maybe you could change how you advertise it."
5,Making Beauty out of Ugliness,"This film follows a father as he and his son are thrown into a concentration camp in world war two. Roberto Benigni plays the father and turns this horrible situation into a comedic and laughable treat. It is a very innovative movie, I think the first one shedding light on how horribly disturbing the Holocaust was, and how some people must have coped with it while in the camps. The cinematogrophy is beautiful."
5,Benigni Continues to Top Himself,"With Life as Beautiful Roberto Benigni vaults himself from the ranks of good funny man to great all around actor. His wonderful use of physical and situational humor are astonishing. Life is Beautiful is a delightful film about a Jewish man who chases his love through a series of happenstances. The story then takes a dramatic turn as the Nazi's enter his city and he and his family are sent to a concentration camp. This is where the film really makes itself memorable. Benigni is unforgettable as he uses everything in his heart and his head to keep his son happy and alive, promising that all of the horror is just a game and if he can play it well enough he will win a tank. The DVD isn't much of an extra benefit, but it does allow you to watch it in English or Italian. Please, please watch it in Italian. Hearing the emotions of the actors makes it worth the effort."
5,A miracle in modern cinema,"Maybe I'm losing it, but this film inspired me to go outside and be helpful to EVERYONE I meet or know. It may sound cheesy to people who have not seen this movie, but pick one person out of a group who has seen this movie, and he or she's attitude to life would have changed, they might not admit it, but their life would have changed, if only a little bit. How many films could be powerful enough to influence this? Think back and count. There have been masterpieces in the past, but film, I believe, was not created to be mastered or perfected, but to affect others, to change attitudes. This film is a real example of that. I'm sure you all know the simple story, so see this film if you haven't seen it, see it again if you have, don't let the hype and people's occasionally misleading opinions ruin it for you."
5,"A simple,but brilliant movie!","Benigni's got it all: funny the most part of the movie, serious when he needs to be... I'm sorry for mister Hanks, one of my favourite actors of the ""new generation"", but Benigni simply deserved the Oscar... and when you think at the fact that he's the first not english speaking actor to win the Oscar, you can't argue at the idea that he achieved something brilliant. Bravo Roberto!"
5,wnt to watch the movice,"I heard the movice form my customer. He said this is the best one of movices he had seen. So I want to see it, It is so long time we can't find the exacted movice, but I don't know how to find the movice on INTERNET. PLS HELP ME!! I am a new comer of this pogrammer."
3,not for me,I really found the over the top humor a little bizzare and somewhat inappropriate - but it's obviously a powerful moving story. It lost me as things started unravelling and it was like this man was still somewhat clueless. And the fact that he seemed clueless - made the humor to me seem bizzare. It would have been more believable had he really been 100% aware of what he was doing. But there were times in the movie that he wasn't really aware of what he was doing ...
2,Very disappointed,"I debated on renting this movie for months and I finally broke down and got it after reading through all the reviews here.It was a huge let down to say the least. This film is so over the top and unrealistic it borders on ridiculous. And like another reveiwer said, it is one coincidence after another from beginning to end. I anticipated a poignant film. I expected to cry for the characters and it was impossible to do so considering the silly antics of the lead actor which never ended during the entire film. There are no horrific or realistically sad scenes to cry over anyway. The little boy was no more convincing in his role than the lead actor and the wife was a deap pan non-entity. I can see now after viewing it why so many here are disgusted by the way it turned a horrid event into a high-drama Dick Van Dyke movie. I truly hope none of the Holocaust survivors subjected themselves to this travesty.Btw, I gave it two stars because the scenery and photography was exceptional."
3,no surprises,"I have seen both the Italian version & the English version & in my view, it's wise to go for the original version. Even though nothing is lost in understanding the content of the movie via English, & that the English is spoken in Italian fashion, nothing beat the original. The movie holds no surprises. Simply seat back & ""enjoy"" the movie. I reckon ""enjoy"" is not a wise word to use considering that we are watching a movie about life in the concentration camp. Benigni is pure magic & I don't think anyone would have the weight as he is to carry the movie. The message of the movie is simple, the love of family surpasses everything in this world. I still think that ""Life is Beautiful"" is a one man show whereas ""Cinema Paradiso"" to date still remains one of my favourite Italian movie. Having said that, this is still a movie worth your while to watch."
5,it's the best film of the year.,I sow this film in Russia. It's realy one of the best films.it's a tragedy and comedy together. After seing this film i'm impressed. My english is not so good to express my fillings after seing this film. It was realy the best forein film in festival.
5,what a beautiful movie,"This movie shows how truly touching a parent's love for a child can be. It was a wonderful movie. Definitely my favorite of 1998, or probably even of 1999."
1,Not for Cats - In my experience,"I sprayed this on areas I did not want the cats to go. They sniffed it, and continued on their merry way. Not sure what happened."
5,Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,"Found this book over 40 years ago as a child, while looking through boxes of things that belonged to my mother as a child. At the age of 50, I love this book as much today as I did as a child of 10. It's a story of hope, and of triumph of hope. I wish I had an attitude like Mrs. Wiggs."
3,A comical Read,This book is for children ages 7 - 12 and is written in a southern style. A good book report book.
4,good price & nice smell,The price is very good and the smell is nice.It is very girly perfume. Floral smell and good to wear in the evening!( a little bit strong).
3,"nice eau de toilette, but won't last long","This eau de toilette has a fresh smell, suitable for man and woman. But it won't last more than 2 hours."
1,WARNING: MAGNETS on the front of a VCR!,"I just opened my new JVC HR-S9911U VCR. On the front there's an acrylic panel that flips down to expose the tape slot. Incredibly, this panel is held up by MAGNETS mounted right next to the tape slot.A VCR plays MAGNETIC tape. If there's anything you don't want on a tape player, it's MAGNETS. Not only does JVC put magnets on the outside of this device, they put them less than a centimeter from the tape slot. Will they erase your tape? Not entirely, I'm sure. Will they degrade your tape? You'll never know, because once you load your tape, it's too late.It gets worse. JVC could have put the magnets on the acrylic part that flips down away from the tape, and just put pieces of metal next to the tape slot. They did just the opposite. The pieces on the flip-down panel are the non-magnetized ones. I put a picture of this blunder at http://getambitious.com/probs/stupidJVC.htmMonumental stupidity from the company that invented VHS."
3,Three and a half,"It's a very decent comeback after the disappointing Brand New Day. On this album he returns to the form he had on Ten Summoners Tales, but adds many new ingredients such as electronic beats and eastern touches. Out of 12 new songs, there are 9 that are top Sting material, Book of my life being one of the best things he's ever written. The difference with Ten Summoners Tales is that it has 3 songs that could be qualified as filler: Sacred Love, Forget about the future, and This War (sounds like an unfinished demo). Like a Beautiful Smile is a great song also but it's kept off the album for some bizarre reason."
4,Sacred Love Review,"I haven't actually purchased this album yet but have streamed it several times of the vh1 website. At the end of the day I believe that it is very solid. There are some very good songs and a few mediocre ones (which aren't necessarily that bad). To me the songs that stick out are Send Your Love, Never Coming Home, Stolen Car, and Inside. These songs are very cleverly written and have a very unique sound, something lacking in today's music world. Sting is a talent that has certainly stood the test of time and this album does not disappoint."
2,cdnow is making these reviews a joke,"I'm not going to bother retyping the review. Long of the short of it, best sting album since 10 summners tales, but not that great.What you should know is that there were something like three hundred reviews here last week. Many far less kind than mine and now there are fifteen. And this is apperently common practice because other reviews I had thought I'd written a while back on more obscure bands were no where to be found either. This one I know I wrote."
5,Winning the Race: Beyond the Crisis in Black America,Excellent book. This book provides new and interesting prospective. I highly recommend it for both serious students and laymen alike. Community and school leaders will greatly benefit.
2,too many adverbs,"I want so badly for this book to be good...But it was one of the most un-conversational books I've ever read. It's one over worded, adverb heavy, redundant phrased, run-on sentence after another. He crams two or three points into each sentence. But, yet, hence, of course, after all, obviously, however, quite simply get to the point! Why am I so annoyed by this book? Because he started a sentence with ""Always, sometimes""! Did anyone edit this book?If McWhorter wants to communicate with more people, he needs to loose the chaff and learn to write. He is a smart person with great ideas. After reading ""for all ""extents"" and purposes"" I had so stop reading the book...good thing I borrowed it"
2,Disappointing - He Has Produced Much Better Work,"I was very impressed by the author's Losing the Race and Power of Babel and felt the information he provided outweighed the occasionally uninspired writing style. Unfortunately, in Doing Our Own Thing the content was less impressive and the writing needed work. In this book, I was only able to get a third of the way through before giving up. There was far too many anecdotes, fond recollections and opinions and too little quantitative assessments and incisive analysis. It seems as if the author just wanted to knock another book out and did not take the time to provide more substance, which is absolutely necessary when dealing with an emotional subject where people perspectives and experiences vary so greatly."
3,Good book but long read,This book is well researched and has a lot of information but is a long read. I feel it could be more readable (less academic) to appeal to a larger audience
2,Peace,"Apparently, one of the finest minds that we have produced and have enjoyed all of Brother McWhorter's work. Though an extension of his previous themes, it continues to show that he is seriously grappling with these issues and is asking many of the ""right"" questions. He also is placing his emphasis in the correct areas; ie. the plight of the black working and underclass. Of coarse, would like to see more footnotes and hopefully his tenure at the Manhattan Institute will afford him the opportunity for more research staff.Only complaint is the unnecessary demonization of Stokely, even though in many ways we agree on what he became was problematic, however the contribution and commitment Stokely made for the advancement of the movement was monumental. Read ""Ready for Revolution by Thelwell, or Making of a Black Revoultionary by Forman of Taylor Branche's trilogy to mention just a few to substantiate this claim.But, my Brother, Keep up the good work and stay Black!!Respectfully,Bob"
1,not all my items shipped,"I got 2 of these bras, and only one shipped. I was really disappointed. Even after correstponding with the seller, I'm still left with just one bra. I'm pretty irritated. The bra is okay...it's a little weird cause the back has 5 of six clasps."
2,no support at all,"Although the company was great to work with, but the bra leaves a lot to be desired. the bottom band is tighter than other bras of the same size, and the bra itself has no support at all. might as well not be wearing anything at all : ("
1,Not what I expected,"Very disappointed with this bra. Wanted a truly comfortable pull-on bra (no hooks) in a satiny fabric. This one was the wrong fabric and has hooks in back. Also, I ordered B cup but cup was big. Doesn't somebody make a pull-on, no-hook elastic bra that a large, meddle aged small-breasted woman can wear?"
2,not an AAH,"This is not a binding bra, true, but everything shows through! Only good for bedtime if you like that."
3,Lace Comfort Bra,"Was not pleased with this item haven""t even worn it after trying it on I should of have read more or learned more of the product, but that was my fault, but i recieved it very quickly once I ordered it. And if I was to see something else from the seller that I liked I would order from them, because it wasn""t their fault I didn""t read the details of the item."
4,Track Listing,"Track Listing1.Safe Journey (Todd Terry 7"") 3:462.Safe Sex (Todd Terry Short session) 3:463.Safe Journey (Todd Terry 12"") 6:214.Safe Sex (Todd Terry Long Session) 6:445.Safe & Sound (Todd Terry Acapella) 4:376.Safe Place (Todd Terry Dub) 6:137.Safe House (DJ Tonka 12"") 8:008.Safe as House (DJ Tonka Instrumental) 8:00"
1,bad movie with historical significance,This is one of the propaganda films from Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution. The only reason I bought it was to re-live a childhood memory. I can't imagine anybody buying this for reasons other than nostalgia or because they're studying the arts of the Cultural Revolution.
1,NOT instructional. Disappointing.,"I was familiar with some of the players on this DVD before I purchased it and was expecting something better than this. There is absolutely no instructional material in written form nor commentary in the video. It is strictly aperformance package thrown together from excerpts of other instructional videos. Although the songs played seemed to be quite technical & challenging, I found most of them were not pleasing to my ear. There were a couple of exceptions but not enough to bring up the rest of the tunes. The format of the dvd doesn't allow you to play the whole thing through either, you have to play each piece individually and have to go back to the main menu to change performers. Very annoying to say the least. I'm not one to dole out a lot of negative information but this dvd was not worth my time and effort. The only plus is that it cost less than $4bucks. In a word, ""awful"". Sorry Mel."
4,excellent almost-EP,"The live tracks on this single were recorded in NYC a few days after September 11th so they are especially powerful. The only downside to this single is the price you pay for 5 songs, but that's the way with b-sides and non album tracks isn't it. All in all a must for an incubus fan."
5,Melting force~,"I have nothing to add to this fantastic album. It melts my heart and soothes my mood. I, as a drummer, tremendously obsessed by Mel's playing; ensembles and solos of each song too very inspiring! A must have big band record."
2,A couple of good tunes.,A sad version of The Best Of Henry Gross. Without the great tunes like Southern Band & Dixie Spiderman all you can look forward to are Tomorrows Memory Lane and One More Tomorrow. Plus the song All My Love.
3,Missing the Best!,"I have been a Henry Gross fan for a long time. The Best Album of all time ""Plug me in to Something"". Gross rocks on this one. I'm baffled as to why Southern Band and Dixie Spiderman were not on ""Best of"". If these songs were on ""Best of"" I would have given 5 stars, Sorry Henry."
4,it's an ok cd.,"i argee with the people, plug me into something rocks! i have the lp , but the cd would be nice so i can hear evergreen & southern band loud & clear. thanks for listening, but this cd is a good effort none the less."
1,"Best of would include all of ""Plug Me Into Something""","I bought ""Plug Me Into Something"" from a local record store a long time ago, that specialized in import CD's. It was manufactured by Pony Canyon Inc. Japan 1975, with the catalog number PCCY-10074. Same artwork as original album with all 10 killer songs. Best $15 I ever spent. Would love to find Henry's song ""Sweet Sassafrass"". Been looking online for it, and can't find album it was on."
2,A joke,"Waste of money because it's missing Travelin' Time, Dixie Spiderman, Southern band, One More Tomorrow and Evergreen from the Plug Me Into Something album. This compilation only has 2 songs from the 10 on the Plug Me... masterpiece."
4,Missing the best,"I think this is a good overall album of Henry Gross's releases. But I was saddened of the fact that my all time favorite and long awaited cd release of ""Southern Band"" was not included."
5,"Run, don't walk...","...to Henry's website (http://www.henrygross.com) and get his latest CD, ""I'm Hearing Things"". It's outstanding!"
2,"REALLY, I mean sersiously . . .","Bleh. That is how I would describe this case book. Needlessly difficult, particularly for 1Ls. While I would not call it the worst casebook ever, I would say this: 5 credit class, 3 times a week, minimum 5 hours of prep work for each class. I am of the firm opinion that expecting a minimum, and I stress minimum, of 3 hours prep time for every hour of class is an unacceptable burden on students. Yes, you do learn a lot, yes the material is well tailored, but without any guidance from the editors, it just takes too long to get through the material."
5,Very inspired solo piano from the master,"Sea airs, recorded in 1989, is another solo piano release along with the ""air"" cd's (night airs and country airs). Personally, I think Sea airs is the best of this trilogy, with kind of sad, minor-key songs. It is an easy-going cd ideal for quiet relaxation."
4,The Collection,"Despite there not being anything new for fans who have bought the bands three albums, this collection does offer some remixes and a compilation of some of their better known tracks in one place.From being discovered by Dave Stewert and their single `Alisha Rules the World' (also the album opener here), Alishas Attic gave us some easy going pop, but with slightly more substance than some of the other bands out at the same time. Both Shelly and Karen have great voices and I still listen to their debut single `I Am, I Feel' with a smile on my face. My favourite though has to be `Barbarella' which I also bought as a single when it was released.There are some omissions here and a compilation will never please everyone, but as an introduction to the band for those who don't want to buy the albums this is perfectly serviceable and gives us enough of their hits to keep most people pleased.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,Better than Annoying ...,"I received this CD as a gift because I am a fan of the TV series. I was looking forward to listening. The CD starts off well, with familiar music and interesting sounds ... but by the time the ""Challenging the Gods"" was play I was well on my way to having a headache. Some tracks are gorgeous, particularly the #4 ""Soulmates"" track which harkens back to the episode ""Prometheus"". But most of this CD feels as if it was thrown together quickly, with little thought. However, Joseph LoDuca is an excellent composer and his talents, despite the material, are the saving grace of this XENA: Original Television Soundtrack."
2,Derivative,"Though this soundtrack is entertaining, it's certainly not exceptional in any real sense. I picked it up because of the resemblance to the far superior efforts of Basil Poledorus (Conan the Barbarian Soundtrack) and Orff's Carmina Burana. Some shades of Jerry Goldsmith here and there, but he's everywhere, so that's not surprising. Anyway, if you're a fan of the show (like me, well before it went from silly to downright bizarre) you might like it."
1,Horribly Loud Noise!,"I purchased this to use for both aesthetic and relaxation reasons. However, you cannot relax because of the horrible noise emitted from it. I don't know if it is just my particular product, but the horrible high-pitched buzzing frequency noises is driving us insane! It states to give the fish 12 hours, approximately, to allow them to start swimming around. Well, it has been 24 hours and the fish aren't moving (they were all at the bottom and are all now floating at the top if that counts). Thankfully, I bought this for less than $6, had it been the price listed now I would have definitely passed. Anyone considering it, please think long and hard. The other users are happy, however, which may mean mine is just faulty."
4,Clownfish--looks like Nemo!,"This toy is great for my toddler. My child just discovered Nemo and is therefore fascinated by fish. We don't have time to have a real aquariam, so this plastic fish faux aquarium is perfect. We don't use the CD rack. It was easy enough to set up. We have it up on a counter so it is out of harm's way--yet fun to watch. Can't comment on long term durability since we haven't had it that long."
5,15-minutes couldn't be faster,"These work exactly as advertised. And I'd like to echo that Rayovac seems to have great customer service. I called to ask whether their 15-minute charger would work overseas (answer: yes, the two-battery one does, but not the 4-battery charger), and the customer service agent was extremely friendly and helpful."
3,Not good for the long term,"I've purchased a dozen of over a year span 3 years ago. I've maybe charged them 100 times each. They charge quickly. The batteries are hot to touch after charging. I only have 4 left of the 12 and the 4 remaining don't hold the charge more than a week. The other 8 stopped charging.These are good batteries for a year or two, but I don't think you should expect them to be useful much after that."
2,May or may not be OK,"Got two packages, each with 4 batteries. The first one failed to charge 2 batteries and my charger actually got on fire. It was a new charger, and this was my first time trying it...so I don't know if the problem was with the charger or the batteries...didn't try to get another charger or try the second package."
2,Could be better,I tried using these in my remotes and wasn't really impressed. I would recommend the Rayovac Rechargeable Hybrid NiMH Batteries. They have been holding a solid charge much longer.
2,Don't hold a charge as well as I thought,"I was a little dismayed that the advertisement for these batteries doesn't state that you HAVE to have the special ""15 minute charger"" to go with the ""15 minute batteries"". The regular charger takes them overnight to charge, just like every other rechargeable battery, and even then they don't hold a charge for very long. With normal use they last maybe a week. Granted, we have been using the flash a lot so maybe that's why."
5,15 minute batteries,About 5 years ago I bought a Rayovac Battery charger. Now I find there is only one place to buy the batteries. I searched everywhere and you can't even buy them from Rayovac. The company that I finally found them were great. The price was a bit high but at least they still have them. They were shipped on time and in good condition. Thank you for being there for me.
5,Still charging!,"I bought these batteries and charger a few years back. They are still charging, while the Energizers that I got about a little after no longer would hold charge for more than a day or two. I used them mostly for wireless mouse, wii remote, camera, etc. Too bad Rayovac no longer makes them and retailers that still have them in stock are jacking up the price. Otherwise I would have bought more. Going to try my luck with the new hybrids."
2,Didn't hold a charge very long,"I have purchased and used these before in 2 digital cameras and they were great, purchased 16 more and then would not hold a charge for more than 2 days and they were dead without use. Returned to Rayovac and they send replacement batteris, but they did not send quick charge."
5,Well worth the cost,"These batteries are great. Watch out after recharging them though...they are hot as a pistol ! Let them cool down for about 5 or 10 minutes before touching them. Also, they measure ""0"" volts until they cool off...then they measure their normal voltage."
5,"Great batteries, buy them if you can!","I have been using these batteries for 6 years now and I love them, I wish I could give more stars. I am sad they discontinued them, I wish I bought more, I am desperately searching for more of them! They Work very well in many devices, charge very quickly for when you use them and still need them quickly, stay charged for long period for us lazy types that charge and forget about them for a week/month--They are still charged and ready to use! I paid about $16 for 4 AA and $35 for a 15min charger, similar price still at $18 for 4 AA. Should have bought more of them, never needed to until now, I need them in multiple devices at once. Great buy, will almost completely replace your need to buy batteries. Take it from me, I haven't bought any for 6 years!!"
1,Rayovac I-C3 Rechargeable AA Batteries,THese batteries must be very old because they do NOT hold a charge very long. No Good. They do not work for more than 2 weeks with my keyboard and mouse.Still Have this Problem
5,Out of Production AA 15min re-charge,"These are very good batteries. We have been using them for +5 years. It was not until, I tried to buy some more that I found Rayovac stopped selling them 4 years ago due to ""lack of sales"". The seller was fast in sending them out, as stated the package was new and unopened. The price is kind of up there, but this guy was smart in grabbing them when Rayovac stopped selling them. We like them because of the quick re-charge."
2,Behind the Monsters,The DVD started freezing up after the first use. I cleaned my DVD player but it continues to freeze up. I put another DVD in and it played just fine.
4,Track of the Bengal,"Personally I like this book it had a lot of sub-plots, stated in an earlier review. Unlike whoever wrote that review I think the author ende some of them fairly well. I liked the technical-ness of it all, unlike some books that don't go into that much. I also liked the fact that the scenes took place all over the world. Some parts were kind of fuzzy, for instance, near the end when, there is only one person on the Bengal, it was hard for me to picture where he was on the ship. Never the less I liked the book, although I'm still wondering about the Red Bombs and Red Mercury. If anyone has any info on this or know of websites that do, would you e-mail me..."
2,"confusing, too long","While the premise is interesting, the author throws in too many sub-plots and alternative plots, which are never resolved, gratuitously throws in rape/prostitution scenes, and extends the final scene (the ship with nuclear device being pursued with conflict of whether to board or destroy it) by an extra 100 pages."
4,History can be entertaining,"A very entertaining read. A suberb story-teller, Dee Brown takes us into the lives of 19 participants in the slaughter that was Little Big Horn. We get to meet and ride along with some of the most colorful characters that seem to have gotten lost between the pages of history. Dee Brown has used eye witness accounts, diaries, letters, and the testimonies of the civilians,and soldiers that participated in this battle.It wasn't just Custer's undertaking, but a full Army battle group."
3,A Non-fiction Novel about Custer's defeat at Little Big Horn,"I read this on the heals of the author's superb Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, and have mixed feelings about it. Expecting it to be a similar historical account, this time on the Battle of Little Big Horn, it quickly became evident that this was in fact a work of fiction based on eye-witness accounts--so, essentially, a non-fiction novel. Nevertheless, I read it in its entirety, and found it to be, for the most part, a good read. Brown attempts to bring to life the experiences of individual participants, and in this he largely succeeds. However, the story mainly focuses on the American invaders, with only a few chapters devoted to the Indians. This makes the book seem rather unbalanced and incomplete, and therefore somewhat of a disappointment."
2,"Hey, I think I know that guy!","This one was okay, but definitely not a favorite. There were just some things that were weird (relationships...you'll have to read it), and I didn't like how it ended for some people.The cover has a classic paperback romance look, obviously. Funny thing is, I know a man who looks EXACTLY like the picture on the front! Haha."
2,"Matchmaker, make me a match","Insipid romance about a widowed minister, Andrew, and his three matchmaking daughters. One of them, pianist Cassandra, believes that warmhearted Juliana will make her father happy. However, she in turn falls for Antonio, Juliana's handsome son, an opera tenor. There's a lot of mistaken identity and wrong impressions here, most of which are Cassandra's doing, which in turn make her look both stupid and irresponsible. Why a handsome tenor would want a stupid woman like Cassandra is another question for another day."
5,The score is better than the film,"Yes, this is a case where the music is much better than the film. There is an interesting combination of moody country inflection from David Torn's guitar with heavy dark orchestral movement."
4,"Not my usual style, but I love it!","I'm most impressed with the depth of Amanda Marshall's meaning in each song (specifically ""Coleen (I saw him first)"" and ""Double Agent""). I usually don't listen to R&B, but the slight folk overtones are apparent and nice guitar, especially in ""Marry Me"" (which is possibly the most romantic proposal song I've heard in a long time).This album inspires me to think about many issues, not just be satisfied with the status quo. If it's not your style of music you enjoy, you simply may not like it. If the tunes are catchy to you, disecting the meaning of each song brings great reward."
1,The demise of Amanda Marshall,"I've decided not to write this review in a sarcastic tone. Amanda Marshall was a breath of fresh air back in 1995 when her debut album came out. I saw her in concert and she was great. Then came Tuesday's Child, an okay follow-up. Then, unfortunately, she released Everybody's Got a Story. I'd rather eat sandpaper than listen to the muck on this album. I think the biggest mistake Amanda made was co-writing all of her songs. She didn't write the songs off her debut, save for three songs. Since Tuesday's Child she's been writing horrible lyrics. UGHHHHH."
2,I can't believe this is Amanda Marshall,"Janis Joplin was special, but if you bathed her rear end in gasoline and lit it on fire, she still couldn't match the pipes Amanda have. So why would anyone want to record Amanda using toned-down, multiple-layered vocals and hip-hopish bass? Someone must be grooming her for Glitter II.After 2 albums that were the perfect blend of rock, soul, folk and blues, albums that were performed with what seemed like a passion indicative of pleasure in the musical direction she was going in; we get this ...... stuff.There are MAYBE 4 songs worthy of her first 2 releases. The rest sound like they were recorded for a TLC album. If that's the kind of music she wants to make, then good luck to her(The first person an artist needs to please is themselves.). I just didn't dig this particular work.Big fans of Marshall should get the album just for the few good tunes. This way, you won't have a gap in your collection when her ""rebound album"" comes out in a few years."
4,Everybody's got a story,"Alright I ammit, I haven't heard the whole album, but I have heard a song the just won't get outta my head. The song I'm talking about is ""Sunday Morning After"".Such a hilareous Melody, especially when you get up out of bed at 1 in the afternoon after one of those ""oh god, I can't remember what I did"" partys. Plus it can cheer you up.If you hear this song, you wanna buy the whole album."
1,Amanda Has Lost Her Mind!,"Amanda Marshall's self titled debut is one of the best canadian albums of all time. The reason? Amanda didn't write the songs! She now thinks she can write. She can't! Her second album was a decrease in quality, this album suffers from a complete loss of quality. Her songs are annoying now. She writes like she is twelve years old. It's such a shame that she insists on writing and her record label lets her. Buy this cd if you are 11 years old, otherwise skip it! You'll be thankful."
5,hey DJ! jack the volume i love this cd!!!,"this cd is amazing!! i love it! I have all her albums and they are so good!! she just keeps getting better and better!Sure this one is different from her other 2, but isn't that what makes it so great?? you can't keep doing the same thing forever.. it'll get boring after a while. So i think it's awesome that she wanted to try out something new! And she did a really great job of it! :)There are soo many fantastic songs on here.. the voice inside, love is my witness, dizzy, double agent..etc.. And inside the tornado is really cool! it's acapella and it sounds amazing! I would love to hear more like that! :)i was really dissapointed with all the negative reviews i read about this album! It's not bad at all! So i don't get why there were so many people that didn't like it! I think it's awesome and everyone should definately get it!!Amanda you rock!! Keep that amazing music coming!"
1,Strong songs,"This is a strong album that is well produced and radio ready. True, Amanda might scare off her die-hard following with such a radical change in style, but give her credit for taking the risk and judge this album on it's own merits. In other words, don't compare it to her previous works. She obviously had no intention of making the same record over and over, so her audience shouldn't penalize her for not doing do. The songs are instantly likeable, which is the biggest compliment one can pay to a pop song. I repeat, POP SONG! Sure the songs are breezy and fun, but the lyrics are at times deep and always heartfelt. The backround vocals (which are anything but ""backround"") also performed by Amanda often add to the ""plot"" of her songs and probably wouldn't be the focal point of such criticism if they weren't quite so loud and obvious in the mix. The songs are fun. Her vocals are amazing and her live show is 2nd to none. Give this album a fair chance."
2,and i was so excited to buy this....,"well, as a die hard amanda fan i am sad to write this review. i have seen amanda live and know every word to the last two cd's. i am dissapointed in this latest. i am not quite sure if i got older or her lyrics got younger. with the catchy sounds of sunday morning after, you have to absolutely crack up at the simplistic, pop lyrics within the song. if you are just looking for a giggly, sorority girl album, you found it. if you are looking for a third display of amanda's powerful voice, sorry... maybe the next one when she is older?!?!?!"
3,Disappointing,"I was so disappointed with this CD, I love her amazing voice but you don't hear it like on her previous CD's. ""Tuesdays Child & Amanda Marshall - Self Titled"" were amazing CD's, I loved those ones. With this CD I felt you heard more from the backing singers than you did from Amanda and I have listened to it a few times and I cant get into it, I find it quite boring."
1,Absolute garbage?,"I usually try to avoid reviewing an item unless I have something positive to say about it, but in this case I'm making an exception to warn others. While I can't say for sure that you'll find this CD to be as bad as I think it is, please understand that I am an Amanda Marshall fan. I think her two other albums are excellent, but this CD is so bad that after just a few plays I think it will end up in the trash can. I was hoping some of the tunes would catch on after a few listenings, but it didn't work. Save your money for something with better potential for a positive outcome."
1,Put your money towards something else.................,"I bought this CD at Best Buy for 9.99, I am thankful that I did not waste a larger amount of money on it. This is by far the worst CD I have ever heard. I saw Amanda Marshall on TV performing a concert, unfortunately I only saw the end which was 2 songs. I enjoyed ""everybody's got a story"" and the other song she performed which I dont know the title of. I wish I had watched the whole concert because I would have realized how terrible her music is. I wish I could get my money back for this."
1,She totally lost it. Wanna be Britney,"Loved her last 2 albums and reluctantly bought it out of pity to be honest. I was even surprised to see that her producer was Billy Mann whom I liked his own albums, but was expecting something better with this combination of talent. Sadly, these guys tried too hard to sound like a some dumb teeny clone. I hope she can redeem herself in future."
1,Everybody's got a story...but this one is SAD,"Having the pleasure to hear Amanda sing live, I was astounded to hear whatever garble this music cd was supposed to be. She completely abandoned her voice and soul, and left us with this rehash half bootylicious, funkadelic, mumbo jumo that is so inane it should have been banned in the states. Try again Amanda."
5,Repeat reads & smiles,"This is one of my 15 month old little boy's favorite books. He loves the simple words (I CAN starts the story and then there is one word on each page: jump, bend, etc.) and the sweet babies who look like him! Next to the word on each page, I wrote in the date when he did the same thing as the baby in the illustration: when he first waved, when he first ran, etc. It is a lovely way to keep a memory. He brings me the book at least once every day with a big smile on his face. Since it is a board book, it's quite durable, too."
5,Sweet little book,"We have always loved Helen Oxenbury's book, ever since my oldest child was a baby. The illustrations are simple, but they still leave lots of room to 'discuss' with a little one. Babies love looking at human faces, and this book definitely fits the bill! We also love the single word isolations.I can't wait to give this book to my youngest son for Christmas, I know he'll love it as much as his older brother did!"
2,Nothing to it!,"Bought this book as a gift for a 18 month old. Wanted an item that was decently priced and had good reviews for a child that age. This book is has at most 3 words per page. I.E. ""I can Jump"", ""I can Dance"", ""I can Run"", etc There really isn't anything to it. One reading is enough and won't hold the attention of an 18 mth old. It's a one time use book."
3,boring book,"the book is a little bit boring,I bought the whole series, and my daughter just spent 3 minutes reading it since it sit in the shelf for one year."
3,Brother Bear,"i saved up my pocket money for awhile and decided to get this game.i think its ok,but it is way too easy!i finished it in probably about an hour and a half.if you are a more advanced gamer,you probably will not care for ths game. i think its cute,and the graphics are pretty good,but would recommend this for someone younger."
5,A good fun game,"My 5 1/2 yr old loves this game. It saves your progress so you can go back and replay previous levels. There are some challenging areas for her and that makes it more fun. I don't play many of her games, but this one is fun."
3,Bowtrol,Worked really well the first couple times but it lost its effect after a while. easy to swallow and the scent is almost non existent.
2,Very general information,"If you think that this will give you step by step instructions you'd be wrong. It's basically a good reference to look up what things are called and where they're located. But at that point, I jumped onto Toyota forums for more details...youtube was also a great help. Unfortunately I had to open the wrapping to find this out."
1,Quite possibly the worst Haynes publication ever printed,"$23.00 wasted. It should be titled the ""Toyota Sequoia Partial Manual with Limited Illustrations and the Worst Photo examples ever!"" I got an ALLDATAdiy subscription to my SPECIFIC VEHICLE with OEM parts and assembly diagrams, CLEAR photos and and Detailed Repair information."
4,Good Read,"I too fell into the hype of Rhapsody along with many others. I picked up the book, and was pleased with what I read. It was well written and the history was compelling. The plot was slow at times, but I enjoyed the depth it took into the past, so it didn't really bother me much. Prophecy is better three-fold. It is an extrodinary book, proving Haydon didnt' get lucky with her first book. The story speeds along faster, and the action is more numerous. The only possible problem is that on several occasions it is too much a romance novel. If, like me, you don't enjoy the detailed love scenes of who placed what where, causing this to pulse, just grit your teeth, because the rest of the story is worth suffering through it."
3,Ashe-Rhapsody romance overdone.,"The first half of the book was excellent. Grunthor and Achmed are very appealing characters and it's pretty cool to have them do their thing. Rhapsody's growing skill in battle and the use of her song magic has some appeal as well.I agree with some of the other reviewers though, Haydon goes on and on about how Rhapsody's beauty just overwhelms everyone she comes into contact with, and she's so friggin' perfect, she doesn't even know it. The fact that she was formerly a prostitiute is the only thing that gives her character any sense of realism. The romance with Ashe took up most of the second half of the book. Rediculous filler.I will also read the 3rd book, I'm anxious to find out how Rhapsody can overcome the F'dor [...]."
2,Stop after Rhapsody,"The heroine is frequently called intelligent, but never proves this. Despite her intelligence, she's completely unaware of the effect her utter physical perfection has on everyone that meets her. She is called fair and compassionate despite being haughty and judgemental.However, the absolute worst of it is any interaction that involves Ashe. Aside from the fact that he comes off as a player character someone rolled up for a d&d; campaign (see, I'm this half-dragon...), his presence turns any chapter from fantasy to bad romance.If you seriously browse the romance section when choosing a book, you may just love this, though."
4,Another Excellent book,Although this book is not quite as good as the first in the series. It is well worth reading. The plot twists keep you reading and the ending leaves you begging for more. I can't wait for the next one.
1,Even my 12 year old daughter didn't like it,"I gave this book to my 12 year old daughter, and she didn't like it either. Too many long prosaic passages with no reference to the direction or plot of the book. Too many discovered problems. Good ideas, but not much execution. The author needs to read some real mythology. Too much idle banter. Too many events that don't connect to other events. Too much like an aimless diary. Too much....."
4,A must read,"All Goodkind books are a must read, this one undoubtedly ranks up with the best of his. It has been eagerly anticpated, do not hesitate to make the purchase"
1,COULDN'T EVEN FINISH,"I really liked the character of Achmed from the first book, so I bought this one excitedly hoping for some Achmed/Rhapsody action... or at least more of Achmed's story.I got neither. This book was SO BORING. Instead of focusing on Achmed, suddenly Rhapsody's ""first love"" Ashe becomes the romantic focus. UGH. Ashe has NO CHARACTERIZATION. If you can imagine a piece of cardboard walking around on paper, appropriately saying ""I love you"" and ""I've waited my whole life for you"" at every opportunity, you have Ashe. FACEPALM. Once I realized that was how the romance aspect would work out, I completely stopped reading. Plus there were huge chunks of text that were just boring back-story or world building that was really unnecessary.I won't be buying the next book in the series. Waste of time and money. I've never been so disappointed in a book."
5,A true rhapsody,"I fell in love with this series immediately. As a fan of Tolkein, it's easy to appreciate the use of language, both in the writing and the background, which is alternatively lyrical and stark as the story needs it. But there is more to Haydon's fantasy than the wonky recitation of lineage or the action-driven plots of other fantasists. This story has brutality that is thrilling beside romantic elements that are even moreso, a sense of music that underpins it and mystery that is totally absent from most of the field. It's like every chapter is a different movement in a symphony. I have purchased all the volumes in Kindle format and am loving reading and re-reading them. Can't wait for the rest of the series."
5,An awesome experience,"This trilogy is an awesome undertaking from start to finish. In ""Prophecy"" the three companions find themselves in the middle of an assassination plot, and Rhapsody must race across the continent to stop it. All the while they seek to avoid war, and find the f'dor before it is too late. You'll laugh at their antics, and be on the edge of your seat at other times. Truly a masterful work, worth every page."
3,Just wasn't as good as the first book,I had been dying to find out how Ashe and Rhapsody came together. That was easy to figure out the two would be together by this book. Ashe's reaction when he finds out who she is is great. Who wouldn't be upset when they were lead on with such a lie?What really disappointed me was Rhapsody's annoying ability to be intelligent and really dense at the same time while wielding all this enormous power. She coasts from event to event with little trouble. Its hard to identify with her in this book.
4,The story continues in satisfactory ways,"I received Rhapsody as a gift to read on a long plane trip, having just arbitrarily chosen it off the shelf. Little did I know that it would quickly capture my interest, so much that I HAD to have the second installment! Prophecy continues the story in ways that satisfy the reader, such as unraveling a few of the mysteries presented in the first book, giving further clues to others, and adding even other mysteries. Haydon pulls her readers along with little tidbits of clues to come, but, disregarding that, just the lushness of her writing style makes readers want to continue. Haydon's fantasy world is very well fleshed out, as are her characters, even when there is always more to learn about them. The pace of her books is never lacking yet I could do with a little less of the sappy romance. That could just be me though. Overall, Prophecy is a fine book, and I am sure the conclusion will be all that the first two books have set it up to be."
5,Wonderful!,"After waiting an agonizing period of time for Prophecy, I devoured the book within two days. I loved how Ms. Haydon has evolved her characters and drew me in even further. One feels as if they are experiencing the emotions and actions of each character as the story unfolds. My complaint? How long do I have to wait for the third!"
2,Disappointing,"I really loved reading Rhapsody. It was excellent. The second installment of the series was a prodigious disappointment. I`m sorry to say that it reminded me of Mills and Boon publications. Anyway, how many times can you read about Rhaps being so excruciatingly beautiful? I will however buy the third book for closure..."
5,Amazing. She's now on my list of favorite Authors,"I have to say, I wasn't blown over by the first book in this series, Rhapsody. It was good, though, good enough to get the second, and for a debuting author, it was Very good. The concepts are new and interesting, the world building is impressive. It's not your typical seen that, done that fantasy.The second book... I can only gasp in envy and amazement. Envy, because I'd love to write like that. Amazement because it's hard to find that the pearl among all the oysters out there, and this is Quite a pearl!Elizabeth is now on my ""favorite authors"" list. She has knocked down Robert Jordan a rung, taking his place on that ladder.This book has wonderful character development. The world is unique. It is a must read."
3,Good to hold you over,Certainly not Jorden or Brooks but good enough to hold you over till the heavy hitters are ready. The Characters are interesting and well fleshed out....a little detail of the history of the world and inhabitants would be helpful...some chapters could be eliminated all together...Harlequin Romance stuff.......overall I would buy again
2,Not so bad..well not the worst,"I just made it thru Rhapsody and because had nothing else to read went on to this one. I'll concede that at least I was able to finish this book but it didn't move me to tears like other reviewers and overall I wouldn't recommend devoting time to reading it.Ridden with romance novel cliches. The song lyrics are unbearably corny. As with the last novel, the attempts at humor are flat old jokes."
4,Trot...no run past GO and head for the last (bonus) track,"An overall blah performance until you get to the bonus track (#8)--""The Time Of The Barracuda"". Composed by Miles Davis and Gil Evans...featuring notable contributions by Herbie Hancock/Ron Carter/Tony Williams. A free form work bringing back memories of Sketches of Spain at its very finest. Definitely worth the price of admission."
2,What the....? Confusing project from the master,"I've got an extensive Miles collection CD's, vinyl....love absolutley everything Miles..., all periods. This however is like cocktail lounge music. It's like some mistake was made. Compositions, performances arangements all flat dull and uninspired. Maybe some demand was made by Columbia for Miles Davis MUZAK. I'm shocked too that Gil Evans was at the helm. I just don't get it. I've got to listen several more times to see if I'm missing something. In good consience I can't rate aything with his name on it one star;"
2,For the collector,"This disc is a toss-up. ""Song No.2"" and ""Corcovado"" are beautiful. But overall the disc is short and seems less than satisfying. The listening experience is unfulfilling and feels like a mish-mash of cutting-room-floor material. Hardly essential."
5,great for cameras and anything that loves batteries,"I bought this because I thought hey if it can charge in 15 minutes that is great. I got it and it charged them, and then I put the batteries in my camera took lots of photos, no problems. I charged my Ni-Cd in it charged them better then my normal charger. Would I tell others to get this? Oh gosh yes, buy it and never buy any other batteries again. This could be the end of the alkaline battery as we know it."
5,Good charger,"I've had one of these for three years and have used it along with the same 4-AA IC3 batteries to keep my digital camera going. The unit does as promised, charging in about 15 minutes and it will charge non-IC3 batteries, too, though very slowly (seems to be at least 8 hours for a 900 mAh AAA).I did not pay this much for it, though ($45 for the two-bat charger and 2 included batteries), when I bought it. Rayovac no longer makes this product, their premier rechargeables being Hybrids (which are just regular NIMH but have a very low self-discharge rate; normal nimh discharge at 1%/day or so and these other ones at substantially slower than that). Getting the IC3 batteries is increasingly hard and the charger will only fast-charge IC3 batteries.With other chargers on the market now, including fast chargers from duracell and energizer, as well as super-chargers like the La Crosse BC900, I would not buy an IC3 now, but it has been a good charger."
3,Good though not great,"As Fisherman's Blues is my favorite album by this band I ordered this album via Amazon and have listened to it a couple times so far. My main criticism with this release is that several songs seemed unfinished, tentative and not as cohesive as FB. Granted, the bar is set high but so is this bands ability.Fav albums by this band are, in order: Fisherman's Blues, The Waterboys, The Best of The waterboys 1981-90, This Is The Sea, The Whole of The Moon: Best of Mike Scott and The Waterboys, and finally Too Close To Heaven."
1,Not Ready for Prime Time,"A great idea executed poorly.The unit is not a capable of cooling more than a few degrees below room temperature. We live in California and daytime summer room temperature when we are not home is 85F. Wine is cooled to about 75F, even when set on the coldest setting.Temperature setting is wildly inaccurate, off by more that 10F.The unit puts out a LOT of heat under the unit, enough to heat the counter to 120F. Bad design to heat the area below the unit as that heat is radiated up into the unit.The power supply gets very hot, hotter than is good design.The gas canister does not seal very well as it emptied in about a week with no bottle in the unit.The bright LED to illuminate the bottle is silly. Light is an enemy of wine. The fans are quite noisy, too noisy to place the unit near a dinner party.First unit died after a few days.Replacement unit did not cool. Returned."
3,Great product,"I own it. Seems like it is balogna, but works better than any other system I have tried. I have had a bottle of wine in mine for weeks and it was as good when consumed the second time.UPDATE:It breaks constantly. The company did send out replacements, even after the warranty was up, but it will not keep temp after the first month or so. Now I just use it to inject gas into the bottle."
4,It's Sand,"It's sand, and it's red. The bags are pretty small though. Two of them half filled a quart jar."
3,A Slanted Collection of Quotes,"Federer has done a lot of research, and he provides a large number of generally interesting quotations from every President, even those who lacked eloquence or longevity. A number of the excerpts precede or follow the term of office, but they do represent the men who held office--up to a point. Most regretably, however, about 99% of the quotations involve references to the Bible, Christianity, Christ, and God. Those who are ardent about their Christian religion will love this book. Those who would prefer a more balanced presentation of the Presidents' words will not like it at all. And Federer is so intent on Christianizing the Presidents that their humor is all but non-existant, and none seem like real humans--more like evangelists. There are full page pictures of each President, but, in my copy, they are almost all of poor quality."
3,wrench set,"I bought this set so I didn't have to steal the MAC set from the guy I work next to any more. Great set for the money. I use it on a regular basis and would even recommend it for professional use if used properly (no rusted bolts).Update: Having used these for some time now, I have found that they are beginning to wear down and slide a lot on older or slghtly rusted bolts. It looks like I'll have to buy a better set anyway and use these for jobs around the house. Still not a bad set for the money."
2,Thick and heavy.,"Was surprised to find these wrenches are so thick and heavy. Certainly not something a serious mechanic would want to use regularly. I'd rate the overall quality and feel as dubious at best. For occasional use, I'd say they are OK. For twice the price though, you can find much higher quality/professional alternatives. I'm returning mine and going for the better ones."
2,Not what I expected,This item was not what I expected. The Instant Stitch Express items that are advertised everywhere else have 4 disks and this only came with two disks. Maybe that is why it was so inexpensive. It was also difficult initially to start-up on my computer but I finally got it running. I haven't used it yet however so can't comment on how well the software works in creating a garment.
5,CRY ME A RIVER,YOU WILL EITHER LOVE IT OR HATE IT. I PLAY IT EVERYDAY ANDBECOME OVERCOME WITH EMOTION EVERY TIME. BUY IT...TRY IT.
5,Folk's Finest,"No one touches The Chad Mitchell Trio. Finest harmonies, musicianship, musicians, songs, content, you name it. These fellows give you the best kind of goosebumps. I can't begin to give them their due. And Chad's soaring harmonies are to die for. Just glorious ... and tasteful!"
1,Horrified to find yet another book like this...,"I cannot say anything better than the previous reviewer. Kelly was rightly found to be innocent, but not until she spent about 5 years falsely imprisoned. That is the real story we need to hear."
4,Made me think about the way we perceive people that are born different,"This book was thought provoking. It made me think about what 'normal' is. From research that the author had done, it seems that a very high proportion of conjoined twins left conjoined are quite happy with their bodies. It seems that it is society that demands they are changed to a more normal appearance, despite horrible medical problems that will result from the operations. The book philophosises more about this than discusses actual cases. However there were some very interesting recent cases discussed, such as the sacrifice of one conjoined twin to save the other, and a case where the doctors took the parents of a pair of conjoined twins to court so the separation could go ahead."
2,More PC than analytical,"More of a celebration of political correctness thana well thought out study of conjoined twins.If you follow the author's ideology through, any bodymodification--including braces for teeth or body-- isdamaging to a child's psychological health.If you want facts--give this one a miss."
1,sounds more like adult piano music,"This music sounds like stereotypical ""elevator music."" Both my husband and I are very disapointed in the so called ""baby's musictime songs."" It would be more appropriate for adult listening. The nursery rhyme music is simply instrumental and barely recognizable of the classic songs. My husband and I were hoping to sing the songs to our daughter, however the tempo for all the songs is so slow that it was impossible to follow. Altogether the music is slow and boring."
5,aluminum Scoop,The Big Scoop was exactly what we were looking for to scoop out ice from our commercial ice machine.
1,once a year,"this unit last about a year. so buy several as spares, save you on those COOOOOOLLLLLLDDDDD nights without heat because the pilot went out."
2,disappointing,"This little booklet just didnt hit the spot with me. It was not helpful for teachers of kids in other countries like Africa or Asia.. too many American topics or activities, examples.."
3,Bass Hatchback,"I found this sub box for a great price and it was shipped fast. I'm happy with the box's over all look along with the thickness. Though the box looks good, I do know that the termial ports on the box are NOT air tight! Air from the ports blast out like crazy, I'm not at all excited about this! Now I'm faced with pulling out the ports from the box and sealing them the correct way. This box is not made for hard hitting subs!! I got two Rockford fosgates P2's in this box, I'm not sure if its up to handling these subs."
1,Terrible!!!,"I knew that it was a short biography, but calling this a biography is like calling McDonald's a five-star restaurant. It seemed that the writer just used Wikipedia and left out three quarters of everything with relevance to his life and accomplishments. Do not buy...I can't believe I was foolish enough to pay $10 for this garbage."
3,Course book for Educational Leadership Master's Program,"It is okay....tips for teachers as well as administrators. Buying textbooks from Amazon is quick and easy, as well as less expensive than the university bookstore! I would recommend purchasing your textbooks here."
4,Cacti of the Trans Pecos by A.M. Powell,This book fills a gap in the literature. It is well executed and well illustrated. Every cactus lover should have it. The price is very reasonable.
4,Great lit,"Having met the man responsible for this book, I found it very well written with great detail and usable information."
5,Faithfully presented,"I enjoyed this version of Tom Brown. Stephen Fry portrays the compassionate schoolmaster, who attempts to reform Rugby House. A faithful adaptation of the novel."
2,Not what we expected.,"This story had a compelling plot and story development. I chose it for a family movie based on everything on the front and back jacket covers. The drama was intense and disturbing at times. There is slight nudity and some amount of mature theme. It is not rated, but it was not at all what I expected based on the information on the jacket. From other reviews I have now read, the movie is more extreme (than the actual book) in its display of the bullying which occurred in this school. Even though the main culprit does get asked to leave, you always get the feeling he is not punished enough and should have been punished as a criminal. I felt like I made a mistake in choosing it as a family film even though the story has some merit. For the most part, good triumphs over evil in the end. Our family felt like it should have been rated PG-13 due to some mature sexual content."
5,Add my two cents,I agree with everyone else. One of civilization's greatest advances since duct tape. Also handy for quickly charging bicycle lights.
2,Not worth it really...,"The AAA batteries lasted only about 1/4 of the time that a Duracell Ultra II battery would. So if you have devices that hog the power you will notice it drain in about a 1/4 of the time. I would only recommend to get this if you want to be environmentally friendly. I will say that I was AMAZED that it charged the batteries in 15 minutes. Basically I charge them during breakfast they are done by the time I have to leave, but I have to charge them every other day :( where if I had the Duracell Ultra II batteries would last me a little more than a week."
3,No simple Plug and Charge,"I have had the Rayovac PS 5-B battery charger for about three months, and although it re-charges NiMH batteries in the manner it is supposed to do, getting it to charge isn't as easy as it seems. Every time that I plug the charger in an outlet, I have to shake it several times in order to get charger's internal motor to kick in (the green light at the bottom of the charger isn't an indicator that the charger's working). The other day, I spent five minutes getting the charger to work. If this was a better-made device, all a person would have to do is plug the charger in and wait for the batteries to charge. I hope that Rayovac look into this and fix the problem that afflict this device."
1,A Third Rate Book,Going through the book is an agony. the author's English is full of grammatrical mistakes and he has clearly copied others' work without giving due creditsI will not recommend it. Such books make trees cry
3,Didn't Care for It,No story. Just counting. Very few words. I was hoping it was more like the original book with an actual story.
3,Expensive,"Although the book is helpful, it is quite expensive for what you get. Obviously, I should have read the product description a little closer, but I was quite surprised when the item arrived and it was barely the size of a comic book. I would recommend getting a used version."
3,Costly purchase for a 2002 Book!,"The book needs to be updated to include advanced statistics. However, it will do the trick for writing up basic (simple) analyses (i.e., ANOVA, t-tests, etc.). My biggest issue about the book is the cost. I think the price is too high for a 2002 book!"
4,Received Brand New in the box - Looks Great!,Shoes were received packaged in Adidas box and were in new condition. Shoes look great!
2,Confusing - but the violence was clear,"I'm confused by this book. Not sure whether the author's intentions were serious, plumbing the depths of the seamy side of Tokyo through an appalling anti-hero, or was the author just revelling in the mounting violence and degradation? Because let's be clear - this is definitely not the story of a 'Benny Hill-esque sex pervert', it's all about violence and rape. And as for the protagonist, the anti-hero, words that come to mind are coward, misogynist, rapist, hypocrite, cockroach - if the book had been another chapter longer, serial-killer would be added to the list. A highly confronting and disturbed book."
5,A Sex Pervert's Diary,This book is brillant. I could not stop laughing. Buy this book & put into practice.
2,What is left out.,"The book opens with information regarding foods to be avoided that feed prostate cancer along with a endorsement by a medical doctor. The book does not define what is ""meat"" which is a food that the book states should be avoided. It also avoids the categories of seafood and moderate alcohol use such as wine with dinner. I wrote the co-authors requesting a clarification of the above items. Since they refused to answer my inquiry, I consider the book just another vegetarian cookbook with a misleading or incomplete title."
1,just OK,"What can I say, it is just OK. Alot of things if you aren't experimental on ingredients you won't use this cookbook. I would not buy again."
4,BAD INSTRUCTIONS!,"The delivery, and speed of delivery was great...the grip itself makes SUCH a huge difference from the original wood grips I had on my 1984 Ruger Security Six. HOWEVER, The instructions state that you should put it through the small pin hole on the frame of the Security Six. YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS...Instead there is a nickel size hole right next to it..hook the ""stirrup"" in there and then slide it through the channel.. The location of the pin hole will not accomodate enough wiggle room to move it through the channel in the grip. I gave this a 4 simply because in trying their instructions I gave my 1984 Security Six a few undeserved scratches"
5,Hogue Wood Grips For Ruger Security Six,"Excellent fix. However, previous review did come in handy. DO NOT PUT REPLACEMENT STIRRUP IN THE SAME HOLE THAT THE ORIGINAL PIN WAS REMOVED FROM...:( Makes a world of difference from the original wood grips."
4,Great grips,"Great fit and good looking, too. Makes my revolver much more usable. And nothing to catch on my clothing when I'm carrying it."
1,very dissappointing,Unlikable people in a bleak movie with a tragic ending amid unanswered questions. The only thing is has going for it is that the scenes it copies from other movies it does in a stylish was. Very disappointing. Skip.
2,I didn't get it......,"This film had outstanding reviews in the UK, so we ordered it as an import. It starts off well enough, and seems like it will be an interesting film. It starts to slow down and gets a bit confusing, a lot of scenes left us wondering what the point had been. And towards the end it takes a significant turn. I won't go in to details so as not to include any spoilers, but it's fair to say that we just didn't get it at all. I understand the idea, but the delivery left us wondering what it had all been about. There is a lot of overacting, which isn't necessarily a problem in an independent, hand held camera production, but the story was just plain odd and trying to be shocking for the sake of it. We are big fans of independent and foreign movies, and it's very rare I would rate a film poorly if I didn't like it, as it's a subjective opinion, but this has to go down as one of the most disappointing films I've seen, when compared to the high praise it received from critics."
2,last third of movie was stupid.,"gotta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn. wonderfully shot, written and acted. loved the dinner scene. loved the intrigue. loved the mystery.....again, slow burn...that said : the movie, out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and...im not gonna ruin it...becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining. im all about having a deeper meaning in films...but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame. the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending. if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have...this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche."
2,last third of movie killed it entirely...,"this movie came (relatively) highly reviewed and i was psyched to watch it...gotta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn. wonderfully shot, written and acted. loved the dinner scene. loved the intrigue. loved the mystery.....again, slow burn...that said : the movie, out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and...im not gonna ruin it...becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining. im all about having a deeper meaning in films...but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame. the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending. if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have...this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche."
2,Decent movie morphs into unbelievable,This movie was a pretty good character study and action/thriller for the first 75% (4 stars). Then it turns totally unbelievable and quite idiotic during the last 25%. Too bad - it had promise.
4,Not what I expected,"Pretty different premise, a bit suspensful, very original, along the lines of the wicker man. Nice job here, thank you!"
1,Story? Who needs a story when you've got style... right?,"This film is a great example of what you get when you forget about the importance of a story. Watch the first scene and pay attention, because that's exactly how the rest of the film will be. And don't let all the claims of gore and blood and violence lure you in, either. It's very tame and unrealistic. Too bad. Next time I hope this director will take the time to tell a story."
1,A Waste of Time!,Are you kidding me! That is the only thing I can say after painfully suffering through watching one the worst non-horror films of all time. This was not scary and the concept was very poor...watch this if you want to waste time and money.
1,Could understand every 4th word,"I could barely understand what they were saying throughout the movie. My friend and I looked at each other and said ""I just hear gibberish"". The actors have strong English accents.The move is incredibly gorey as well! Skip this movie."
1,STICK TO YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST,"As noted in several reviews, I too am tired of horror movies that have no sensible ending! This one also suddenly turns into a whole different movie in its final third act???Admittedly a very brutal and soulless film, I can't find any redeeming features. Boo to the sound mixing and the often murky accents which certainly didn't help.I respect all reviewers opinions, but sorry guys...I hate this movie."
4,I liked it. It just didn't quite gel for me in the end.,"Ben Wheatley knows how to make a good film. No mistake. And ""Kill List"" is a good film. It has a tense and unpredictable almost-stillness to it, which is slightly unnerving. It makes the moments of violence stand out, along with the casual moments that usually immedaitely bookend them and the domestic moments that abound. Truly, the only niggling I have with it is that while I did see the end coming (and didn't really mind) when it got there, the very end in the field, it felt forced. And that was, I thought, the only forced moment in the whole picture. All in all, I liked it. It's an excellently made film. I look forward to more from Mr. Wheatley."
4,Intense Film,"A strange ultra violent descent into Hell is what this film is. Some have thought the ending is out of left field but if you watch closely throughout and just let the film wash over you, it makes sense. The musical score adds to the tension so much. Not since Rosemary's Baby have I felt the musiccontributed in such an unnerving way. Rent this if you want something different than the usual horror films that have ruined the genre lately."
1,Critics are wrong,Way too much hype by the british critics. The film sucks!!! a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
4,KILLER MOVIE!,"I understand some of the reviews being confused I guess? It's a HORROR MOVIE MAN!!!!!!! It's supposed to be ""FUN ENTERTAINMENT and at times questionable!!"" The issue is, Every director is different and they are artists (like musicians) This director is showing you his art with this film. PEOPLE, Please have an open mind!!?? Great piece of work in my opinion!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Feel Duped,"which is never a good feeling. This book is a reprint of NL's ""Nigella Summer."" This information is not mentioned in the description nor is it mentioned on the book's cover. I returned it immediately. I will view any ""new"" release by Ms. Lawson wirh a skeptical eye."
4,i love nigella,"i made several recepes from this book some time ago, i cant wait to but another book, i just love nigella and her books, they are facinating!! and so entertaining!"
4,Okay,"Having loved 'Nigella Bites' I had high expectations for 'Forever Summer'. I was slightly disappointed with this book. As the recipes are not as fool-proof and fail safe as her 'Nigella Bites', ""Forever Summer"" manages to be okay. Some the recipes look delicious but are very complicated to cook. (Like that wonderful chocolate raspberry meringue-uncookablable but so pretty to look at). I gave it atleast one extra star for the beautiful photography.Still As a nigella fan, it's great to have the set, maybe when my skills improve, my rating of this book will go up accordingly."
3,Forever Summer,"I bought this book together with another of hers thinking they were different, but they were the same, just had a different title! I gave the extra one to my daughter. I liked the recipes."
4,White Chocolate Almond Cake,"This woman has endless food ideas, albeit a lot of her recipes are tweaked classics, nevertheless she does make them seem brand new. I like to write reviews on one of the items I have made. This one if for the white chocolate and almond cake and OMG it tastes as good as it sounds. Super moist and subtly flavoured with white chocolate, I am a huge fan of almond meal in cakes it made this cake simple yet sophisticated. Easy and very delicious!"
2,"Different yes, but just didn't like it","Was really looking forward to listening to this. Yes it reminds me of Paris, maybe I had to be there to enjoy it. Maybe it's an atmosphere thing, but a reminder doesn't mean it's something I liked"
1,Be careful!!,"If you are considering this diet as a life style (especially if you are already thin and healthy), you should consult a dietician to be sure you are getting adequate nutrition. Some fat and protein in our diets serves a purpose. People can become obsessed with being healthy and can develop ""Orthorexia"". This is a form of Anorexia that leads people to become obsessed with being healthy."
5,A classic in the field for anyone with heart disease,"I keep copies of this book in my office for patients who need guidance in how to effectively change their lifestyles to reduce the effects of their heart disease, to reduce the heart disease itself if they are wiling to put the time into learning and practicing the elements of this ground breaking program developed by Dr. Ornish and his colleagues."
4,For those with heart disease,"Gives good ideas and receipes to use in order to change your diet. Has pros and cons but is, however, food for thought."
5,it definately is a book which positively changed my life,"I had an infact about 5 years back,the next step would have been a bypass .My brother sent me a copy of the book,that brought about an quantam improvement in my understanding the problem .The book has helped me arrest my problem and hopefully reverse it . have had np repeat scans or angiography but i do feel as if i have managed to arrest the disease . There have been a few books which changed my life and way of thinking and this book is definately one of the five such books . My only comment is that the book is written from the north american prespective,which is fair but heart disease is hitting the developing world very strongly perhaps you need to ""internationalize"" the book ."
5,I have followed this program and it works,I have followed the program described in this book for five years. It has helped stop the progression of my heart desease. Fiveyears ago surgery was recommended. This book helped meavoid the surgery and improve my health.
5,Natural healing of the heart,His methods have been studied and proven. The only negative is you would have to follow his program to the letter. For some that is difficult.
3,research,"Dr Ornish just skips over mountains of research on the healing benefits of various oils and essential fatty oils.He substitues his own ""clinical trials"" for independent research.I will wait for the independent research to come out before I make an evaluation of his diet."
2,Got bored reading it,"Honestly I was put off by the first few chapters of this book because the author seemed to be ""selling"" his qualifications to the readers. He spends too much time citing his references and detailing the studies that others have done. All of that should have been summarized in the appendix at the back of the book rather than stuffing the first few chapters with those details. After reading the first few chapters I put the book down and have not gone back to it. The book is quite thick and there is ten times more in it than I have read so far. Undoubtedly he is a smart doctor and knows his stuff, but I found his writing style too wordy. As Sgt. Joe Friday from the 1950's TV series ""Dragnet"" would have said, ""Just the facts ma'am."""
2,TOO HARD A READ,I found myself snoring during this book - i need information that can be easily digested. I have a touch of ADD and I can't read something so boring...
1,not pleased,"I purchased this after starting a copy a Dr. friend loaned me. Really liked the orignal book's content and found very helpful. This copy however is half the origional's size,vary hard to read,and I felt compermised what I belived I was ordering."
5,fantastic,I have almost finished reading the book and it is a great book to read I believe for all. thankyou
5,This book can change your life in a very positive way!,"This book (after reading three times) changed my life! My total cholesterol has dropped from 240 to 130-170. I have more energy then I did twenty years ago. I have started a Dean Ornish support group in Portland, Or and have dedicated my life to preventive medicine."
3,for my husband,"Book arrived in good shape. I purchased it for my husband, along with heart disease, he is diabetic. He did not find the book helpful for his combination of diabetic disease and heart disease."
4,reversing heart disease,"Dr. Dean Ornish is a remarkable physician. If you really want to REVERSE heart disease and damage, buy this book and follow it to detail. It really works."
2,UNGAINLY FOR THE READER,"I am unhappy to report that the presentation of Dr. Ornish's book makes it impossible to absorb the information.The font in the paperback is uncomfortably small, and the typesetting is scrunched leaving minimal space, making it impossible for the eye to rest comfortably and stay with the text.Consequently it is a frustrating read and difficult for the reader to take advantage of Dr. Orinish's expertise.Had I been forewarned I would not have purchased this edition."
3,interesting,"A very dry reading. For anyone serious about changing old habits it's a good book. It;s dated as there;s a lot of new data, medicine and procedures since it was written."
3,Use English !,The word is UNHEALTHY .... NOT unhealthful.In no dictionary can I find this word 'unhealthful'. So WHY USE IT when a perfectly good word already exists?CNN is great at inventing words. Let's at least keep these stupidities off this website.Thank You
4,"If anything like original, it has to be a hoot","I recently acquired an original version of ""Wolf in Chef's Clothing"" and had to pick myself up off the floor, where I happened to be rolling around in laughter. It's a great concept, and what fun to use!"
4,An Bachelor's Guide to Cooking,"An awesome book for the young man who wants to impress his date with food. A guide for guys who are unfamiliar with the workings of cooking. The recepies are good and the procedures are in-place for the guy who has little knowlege in the culinary arts. When the recipe calls for a teaspoon of something, a picture shows a teaspoon. Likewise, for a half of a teaspoon. Simplicity in its best form. Also would be a great starter cookbook for the older child."
5,Gaining Incentive,"I'm happy with this book, but two chapters in particular stand out including four, Feed Your Head, and five, Overcoming the Tendency to Stay Put. These two got me in motion. I found myself making calls, visiting some new Internet sites, and going down a path I didn't go down before. If you think about the phrase ""today is the first day of the rest of your life"" that would be a reasonable description of the kind of theme and incentive that this book gives you. I am only half way through right now but I already feel like I got my money's worth."
1,yeeesh!,"This guide should be titled ""You're an Idiot for wasting your money on this book.""Nothing but the obvious is offered here."
2,"""A research diary"" type of writing","Maybe it's because I am not an English native speaker, but I didn't like this book and the book wasn't very helpful to my focus of study. It's reminds me ""a research diary"" type of writing, where author reflects her opinions, problems, emotions regarding to her interviews based on feminists methodology. I expected something else from the book, but book might be useful for those who have some doubts about their research and want to know how other explanations are possible."
4,Basic 7 piece utensil set,Nice set for the price - stainless steel - sets up well on countertop with minimal space. The only negative is part of the long handles are not finished off(they are rolled inward) and so have slightly sharp edges.
3,OK Utensil set,"I bought this from Macys and liked the concept, Basic is what it is. Light weight but able to handle most cooking activities. Over all just Okay. Fine as a starter. The other tools in this set I liked also.This will do just fine a someone just starting out."
5,This Band Rocks,"What a great collection of songs. I heard this band before, and they keep getting better. The CD is almost worn out, I have listened to it so much!There are too many great tracks to be able to single out just one. I have a good feeling about this group.We will be hearing more of them in the future. Too much musical talent to go unnoticed. The musicians are exceptional, vocals are great. A can't miss collection. Don't let this one get away!The ""Memphis Sound"" is back !!"
1,"GARBAGE, DESERVES A ""ZERO"" STAR!","Remember what they say about, 'If the price is to good to be true, it probably is!"" Well, I thought I had found a real deal with this, a ""confetti cut shredder"" for $100, well when i got it, it shredded in large READABLE clumps. Total garbage. But AMAZON as always stood behind it and returned it.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,does the job,I don't like how the shred container doesn't securely sit in the compartment once you push it in after emptying it. Other than that inconvenience I don't shred enough material to give an accurate opinion on if this shredder is heavy duty as it should be.
1,Didn't I review this an hour ago? Too much confetti!,"I thought I reviewed this product an hour ago, complaining about all the confetti that got all over the floor. I won't buy ANY shredders ever again. I'll use scissors. Too bad I have no fireplace: burning would be easier than cutting."
4,Powershred,"I've owned the shredder for about a month and so far, so good. It has performed as promised and advertised."
5,the best shredder,"After wearing out several lighter shredders, we got tired of replacing them. So we bought this heavier product. It is fantastic! Handles multiple pages at once. Does not get packed down with paper in the shredder teeth like others do.We were at first fearful about shredding credit cards and CDs/DVDs since this ruins other shredders that were also rated to handle them. But this shredder lives up to its reputation! It seems to handle everything we have tried.Love it!"
2,Fellows - not built to last,"My third and final Fellowes shredder has just failed, all three from the same cause; the plastic casing that holds the motor, gears and shredder blades, cracked under stressful loading. The last model was very similar to the model shown, but several years older, and before it failed, it had performed well (thus the two star rating for function). In the second shredder not only did the case fracture, but the plastic gears disintegrated.It doesn't seem that it would be very difficult to design a shredder that; (a) is capable of protecting itself from self-destruction under heavy loads and (b) would allow the operator to safely remove shredder jams that can't be dislodged by pushing the rocker switch back and forth."
2,Does not last long,"Had this shredder for about 2-3 years, used it about once or twice a month, for about 10 minutes at a time. Already broken and no longer works. Do not recommend this shredder."
4,Paper Shredder,"Fellowes PS-77Cs , This sherdder works well and stronger than my previous Fellowes Shredder. It is a little more noisey than the previous. I would recommend it."
4,Solid Shredder,"I've had the product only a month. At this point I can give a very positive review. The machine easily takes several sheets simultaneously, can run without shutting down to cool for most jobs. Operation is quiet enough. Confetti is small enough to be effective.If you're using this at home, beware that the unit is tall and will not tuck away conveniently under a desk"
5,Great Shredder,"Overall great shredder. Handles all of my personal shredding needs. Easily shreds through multiple pages of paper, credit cards, CDs, and junk mail with ease. I recommend turning the finger sensor off as this seems to make shredding items more difficult as the sensor always stops the shredder before the item is completely through. You will not go wrong with this shredder for a home office or personal use. Only recommendation would be to supply a bottle of oil with it and possibly some of the shedder compartment bags that you can purchase separately."
5,worth every penny,I had bought a cheaper shredder and burned out the motor. SoI figured I'd pay a little more money for a better one. Icouldn't be happier. With the old shredder I still felt thatsomeone could fish the documents out of the apartment dumpsterand piece together enough to get some delicate information.With the powershred there's no doubt...it would be impossible.It's quiet and powers thru whole envelopes of mail.
5,best yet,"This is my third shredder, and this is the best I have ever had.Besides looking great,it is heavy duty and has had no problems.I can't believe it can be sold for the price I purchased it for.Worth every penny and more.On a scale from 1 to 100 it is a 100.The safety features really make it a standout"
5,Awesome Fellowes Shredder,"I bought this Fellowes Shredder to replace my very old Fellowes and I will say it's a winner. It's quiet and doesn't interfer with the TV like my old one did, it heavy duty and it's a beast at shredding. It has a drawer for the shredded paper instead of picking up the shredder head. If your fingers get to close to the cutter opening the sensor turns off the shredder. I have no complaints and just love this shredder and because of it great quality it will last a very long time."
5,Excellant product,"I purchased this after my last shredder quit in a few months of use. This machine is very smooth, and does everything I was expecting it to do. It's a strong machine that works great"
5,Paul S.,"Built like a tank. But beware, it might weigh more than you do. ""Sturdy"" in this case also means ""heavy,"" but the bin is easily removable for dumping. I've had shredders that moan and groan and slow down if you try to send more than five or six pages down the chute. I haven't tried an entire L.L. Bean catalogue on this one yet (and don't plan to), but this machine feels like it might even be up to a job like that. OK, I'm exaggerating a bit--but not much."
4,More of a beast than you would figure for the money,"This shredder has been excellent - Very good quality on the shred, doesn't make noises like a dinosaur with indigestion when you feed a CD or a credit card through it, and the safety mechanism hasn't been a nusance. Think big-office-quality shredder, just not as fast."
4,Shredder,My first purchase of a Fellowes shredder. Unit is quiet and powerful but the basket seems a little flimsy for this product. However the capacity of the basket is quite large so you do not have to empty as often as some of the smaller units on the market. Overall I would say that I am happy with the product.
2,Acceptable shredder...,"It's a little hard to load, doesn't seem to shred significant amounts at a time and struggles with any kind of thickness. It seems to take awhile to load it manually. It does shred, but I don't think I'd recommend this to anyone."
3,PS-77Cs Shredder,"The sensor for auto feed apparently is an issue as after two months the shredder will not shut off in auto. I tried eveything to clean the sensor and believe me there is nothing blocking it, but the shredder still runs continuously in auto. I just turn it on manually when needing to shred. Other than the sensor the shredder does a nice job of doing what it is suppose to do and that is shredding.Fellowes 32177 Powershred PS-77Cs Shredder"
4,Confetti Shredding Isn't Like Confetti,"The shredder is what everyone has stated: Heavy duty, sturdy and easy to empty. I was disappointed when I shredded some items only to find that it really didn't cut into ""confetti""; it cuts into strips. The strips are smaller than standard strip shredders (about 1 1/2 inch), but I thought it literally did cut into confetti-size. We're keeping it since it is not worth the shipping cost to send it back. If you are looking for true confetti size shredding, look at the ""diamond"" cut shredders."
4,Great home shredder,"I purchased this shredder about a year ago in order to clean out the three bags of shred-material I had piled up. I was able to knock out the backlog in a relatively short period of time. Here are some of the highlights:Pros:-Fairly fast shredding paper-It can really do a reasonable number of pages at once (I honestly never counted, but would say it is between 10 and 12)-Can do DVDs, CDs and credit cards-Isn't too noisy when just shredding paper (it is all relative of course)-The removable basket makes cleaning up easier-The safety feature is nice.Cons:-Shuts off due to heat after 15-20 minutes of shredding (can be annoying, especially when it stops in the middle of a load).-Jams can sometimes be a bit of a pain because of the touch sensor."
3,Fellowes PS-77Cs Shredder,"Nice quiet Shredder with one draw-back. The housing is made of cheap/flimzy plastic and buckles under the weight of the motor and cutting assembly. Other than that, it works fine."
4,Fellowes PS-77Cs,Operationally the unit performs well - maybe not quite as good as advertized (number of copies it shreds in one pass) but very efficient. Handles single and double copies very well. Quiet operation is a plus. Our experience is a bit over 2 months and has been trouble free thus far. Level of use has been fairly heavy - cleaning out financial files and older records.
4,Good machine just don't let the wife run it.,"The unit is of good construction and only stopped when the wife tried to jam more than the unit could handle. Only had the unit for acouple of months, but for now have had no problems."
4,Fellowes Shredder,"I like the fact that a light indicates if the basket is not completely locked in place, and if your hand is too close the the shredder. In addition, there is a power on/off switch.My only complaint is that the handles to pick up the shredder are in the front and back rather than at the sides of the machine. If you stand in front of the shredder, it is easier to pick it up from the sides (say, to move it to clean under it). Other than that, I think it works just fine."
5,Zero complaints,"Perfect for my small home business. Best price on Amazon and I used the free super saver shipping. Noisy shmoisy, it's a shredder and not that loud at all."
5,SHRED,Great shredder! Seller was prompt in processing order. Packaging was not good - I thought initially the product could be damaged as the box was misconfigured by shipper.
5,Very Satisfied,This shredder works very well. I just oil it every time the basket is full and it keeps going and going.
4,Doesn't choke as much,"This is definitely an improvement over those dinky little shredders. It will take those thick credit card offer envelopes without choking. Just remember to keep your fingers away from the slot since that protective shut off feature meant for inquisitive little kids works with wayward big hands too. Of course it will choke if you try to overfeed it but still a lot less likely to happen. If you really need a monster, you might as well cough up the money for a real commercial grade shredder."
5,It works!,"We have a family member who has severe dementia. He also was into stocks for 50 years and saved every paper he ever had...we think! This thing is still working after many days of almost constant shredding! A couple times it shut itself off as it was overheated. This is a nice protection. This thing works! It is my first one. So, I really don't know how slow it is. I would get desperate and put many pages and all but onces it kept on .... One time, I had to pull out a couple papers...but really what did I expect! I probably shredded 1000 credit card and plastic things! IT WORKS!"
4,Powershredder,We bought this shredder for our small business. We had another small shredder that was not confetti type. This one is and is so much better. No one will be able to put any of our papers together. I really like the shredder for credit cards. Alot easier than trying to cut them up by using scissors. I would highly recommend this to a family household or a small business.
4,Good value,Well worth the money compared to the light duty one I had before.Waste bin could be made a little stronger but does the job.
4,solid performance,"It can shred several pages at the same time, even with staples still attached. It has a safety stop feature to protect fingers, and runs for a few seconds after each use to clear the paper and prevent paper jams. It's not too loud, and the removable bin is good-sized to accommodate a lot of paper before emptying it. My only quarrels with it are that some paper shreds tend to spill out when I remove the bin, and that if you shred CDs or credit cards, the plastic shreds fall into the same container as the paper - not good for recycling."
5,Too Cool for School,"I really love this shredder. Efficient, effective and honestly, kind of fun! It takes whole envelopes full of junk mail and makes mince paper pie out of them. I'm probably a little lucky it still works because the first day I got it, I couldn't stop shredding stuff and by the end of the night it was pretty darn hot but alas it is still working like a charm almost a month of heavy shredding later. Also, it almost perfectly holds a paper grocery bag in the bin(which is what our recycling requires we put paper to be recycled in). I did notice it does works better and sounds happier if you add a little lube as directed."
3,Ability to Shred Twelve Sheets? No.,"I bought this for my business after reading the reviews for it and many others. It just came in the mail and I happily started to shred the pile that was waiting for it-so far no problems....until I put an envelope from the USPS for change of address (not very thick and certainly not 12 sheets) and it got stuck. It got stuck to the point that I had to hold down the Reverse button while yanking the envelope out. I then did some more shredding without issue and got to another envelope that was 1/2 the thickness of the USPS change of address and again it got stuck to the point that I had to hold down the Reverse button while yanking.This seems to be a LIGHT shredder, but it will do."
2,Disappointed!,"After reading all these ""rave"" reviews of this shredder, I decided to go ahead and buy it. Boy, was I disappointed. Why?1. The shredder itself is VERY heavy and buckles the flimsy plastic basket assembly below.2. It shreds very slowly.3. It can only handle approximately 8 pages at a time.4. It jams fairly easily.5. It jammed with the first DVD I shredded. The second DVD shredded fine.6. The basket is small and the shredded material is very messy (contains paper dust). It seems like the blades are not too sharp because the shredded pieces have a very rough texture.That said, I would NOT recommend this shredder."
4,Good Shredder but if you also use as a waste basket - a pain,"I bought to replace another Fellow 55S (I think was the model)that I had bought about 7 years ago..My old shredder was also a confetti (cross-cut) but it cut thepaper in about 1/2 of the size of this one..I never put more than a couple of sheets in at a time and thatis why my first shredder lasted so long.Likes:* The ability to shred CDs* The ability to shred credit cards.Dislikes:* My previous shredder had a opening so I could use it as awaste basket..so I now have to pull it out and push it backin which isn't really a fault but my personal preference.* The Power Head is very heavy, I think if it fell over ona hard surface it would break..* When you put the head on, make sure it ""snaps"" into place,it almost fell on my foot since I didn't use enough ""force"" tosnap the head into place the first time..ConclusionI do like the shredder and will probably buy another Fellowesin the future.Hope I get 7 years out of this one.. :-)"
1,Incredibly flimsy case,"The case buckled under the weight of the shredder. I don't recommend this item, regardless of how well it might shred."
5,shredder,I've went through serval shredders and this one has proved excellent. I shred a lot of paper had no jams or breakdowns with this one. It's easy to empty.
4,It works as anticipated and better ...,"I have filled five 32 gallon garbage cans with materials I've shredded using this. I had it overheat on me only once (and I was pushing it). It does not surprise me it overheated, and I do not grade it down for this reason. I did feel it took too long to cool down once I overheated it. I dropped it one star for this reason. But I am very happy with this shredder. It does a fine job and was a good buy."
4,Happy with this item,"Does everything it says it will; Quiet. Not too large a unit, but good size paper bin which is easy to empty. I didn't realize what a crummy shredder I had until it broke, and now I'm happy it did because this one is so much better. It shreds several pages at a time, and handles credit cards and cd's without strain. The only flaw is that the plastic casing on which the shredder unit rests is flimsy, but this doesn't detract from its function or appearance. Time will tell if it affects durability."
5,Very powerful shredder!,"This shredder is really great! We've been downsizing and getting rid of tons of financial statements, and this shredder is like an industrial strength shredder. If you need to shred a lot and quickly, this is the perfect shredder. If you need to shred something occasionally, this is probably too much shredder for you. It's only become jammed once in the year that we've owned it, and it was clearly a case of our putting in too many pages at once. After we cleared the shredder, it worked perfectly again. It also shreds CDs and credit cards, and the tub holds a ton of paper. The emergency stop works well - if you barely touch it the shredder stops, so there's no danger of drawing any blood."
5,"At last, a shredder that works","I have been plagued by medium priced shredders that get themselves all tangled up in the shredding. After a few sheets, I have to manually untangle the machine, risk getting cut by the little teeth, and in the time this took, I could have ripped the sheets to shreds myself. I am a medium user, own a salon that has 5 employees, so it is not like I am a shredding monster all day long. I could be, however, with this Fellowes Powershred. It has not tangled up, it is quiet, and it shreds, which is the entire goal of my purchase. I have a Fellowes at home that has worked without incident forabout 15 years. I am looking forward to a long, stress-free relationship with this new purchase."
4,"Nice, But........","Shredder seems very heavy duty. Will shred anything I put in. The only thing I don't like is the feed slot is in the front, which requires the paper to turn downwards to the blades. I generality will need to hold the paper with both hands and push it in to get it to go around the corner. I'm sure this is to make it harder for someone to get their fingers in there, but it makes the shredder harder to use. The shredder does have a smaller slot on top which feeds straight in for putting in credit cards and CD's. This works well for envelopes and smaller papers, avoiding the shove it in past the curve problem."
5,Works great and looks good too!,We replaced a shredder that broke - this one is great and it actually looks good too!
4,Great shredder for home use,"Does a great job of shredding and has convenient removal of collector. However, if you overflow collector, can end up with paper mess to clean up."
5,Shreader for home office,It eats staples and the reduced price made it a deal. Much better than the typical home-level unit.
4,"Hey, It Shreds and It Still Works","What can you say about a shredder other than it shreds, it hasn't broken, and it hasn't even jammed. Then again, we haven't put a full ream of paper through it at one time or tried it with nails and paper clips. It's short of ""industrial strength,"" but the industrial shredder we had cost $900. This is a good value and it shreds 7-8 pieces of paper at one time without a problem. It's not beautiful. It's not a piece of sculpture. It's a shredder. For all I know, it may even work with cheese. 5 stars if it does."
4,It's a keeper,"I bought this to replace my 6-year-old Aurora shredder after I jammed its motor. Compared to that, it's a powerhouse. I had to shred about 10 pounds of paper that had collected since Aurora's death. The Powershred finished the job in short order, with only 2 minor jams that were easy to reverse. You need to be careful if you're using heavy stock paper, don't push the limit. I followed the instructions and let it cool down after each 20-min shred session... the motor felt hot but didn't overheat, and I was able to restart within another 20-30 min. The safety shut-off is awesome, especially with 2 curious cats around, and I like that its use is optional. Good capacity storage, and easy to empty. I'm not keen on using the oil, I find it rather messy, but in the interest of longevity I'm using it anyway. Good value for a medium-use shredder. Overall, definitely happy with this purchase."
5,Worth the money,"After spending less on two schredders which didn't last a year, I bought this one which is just perfect for ordinary home use. Please note that the reviews that were negative used it at at least 10x the load it's advertized to manage."
4,Nice shredder,"Just bought this shredder and it is perfect for our household needs. It does a nice job of shredding documents, cd's and credit cards. Also received a great price for it on Amazon."
4,7 years of paper work now gone!,"I like this shreader. I had a smaller one that clogged up regularly... like after 4 sheets... I got so fed up I just kept hording the ""to be shreaded"" papers by the bagfull! But this shreader takes care of business... I have cleared out all those papers and now keep it by my trash can... I check my mail... shread, immediately, what needs to be shreaded and toss the junk."
4,Fellow shredder overall good performer,This is my second Fellows shredder now in use at two locations. You must be careful to put sheets into shredder perfectly straight ir it will jam. It will not handle the rated number of sheets without jamming. Jams are hard to clear. Aside from this it is probably one of the best out there.
1,Don't leave this shredder on Auto-On!,"The Auto-On feature of this shredder should NOT be left on, or it will burn out. This isn't clear in the directions. A customer rep at Fellowes actually told me that leaving the shredder set to ""Auto-on"" is also a fire hazard. That isn't mentioned in the directions, either. I'll steer clear of Fellowes next time..."
4,"Great Shredder, would give 4.5 stars","I have owned several shredders in the past including other Fellowes models. This one far exceeds previous models. It shreds 12 pages as described, no problem. Safety bar nice when kids are around. It has unexpectedly stopped shredding when no fingers were around, had to clean the bar. Basket adequate and I like the window to view how full.Only negative is it does thermal shutdown after short period of time when doing a lot of shredding and you must wait until it cools to resume."
3,Less than Expected for Price Paid,"Count the pages carefully before you put them in, and don't try to put the maximum 12 sheets in. If the machine gets stuck, you can't reverse the cutter to get them back out. After about an hour of cutting tiny pieces of paper out with a box cutter, I finally got it clear again. But the shredder is so sensitive that the tiny cuts on it at the entry point now throw the pages out of alignment. So, I have an expensive low-use shredder and lots of cuts on my hands. I still have to buy a second machine to do the job I bought this one for. I'm very disappointed. I bought this to replace a Staples shredder that lasted a year, despite heavy use. I thought I was upgrading by paying more. I was wrong. :("
3,Good Product,"Very fast shipment..Koodles.... Product has a powerful motor and shreds what it is stated too. The machine is quiet and the shredding process is slow. The body of the product leaves MUCH to be desired it is made of very cheap plastic creating a very wobbly base, when moved it feels as though it will fall apart. The pull out basket does not stay shut..with the vibration from the shredding it slides open, then the shredder shuts off. I have to hold my foot against it. I would not purchase this product again LEW"
5,supershredder,"This is really a nice shredder. It's very powerful, you can shred credit card application letters without opening them, too bad I can't hook one up next to my mailbox and have the mail carrier drop them right in. Be aware, its about 3 times heavier than my old 5 sheet shredder, and its best emptied by pulling the wast receptacle forward from under the motor, rather than lifting the motor off, so you need enough space to do this."
3,medium sized office shredder.,"The shredder is strong and takes thick paper and paper clips and even does CDs and credit cards. But the drawer tends to easily come out and the shredder is awkward as it doesn't have wheels and when one moves it, the drawer with the paper comes out and a light goes on. IT does have a nice feature that it turns itself off before it becomes overheated or before it shorts out."
4,Fellowes PS-77Cs,"First of all, thanks to those who left reviews about this product, it helped me significantly when making my decision. I will now second guess Consumer Reports reviews, since a number of people gave a bad recommendation on a product that was CR Best Buy. I feel I got my money's worth on this shredder. It's my first paper shredder, and so far I'm very satisfied. Some of the other reviews really ""hit the nail on the head"" when they spoke of the base being too unstable for the weight of the shredding unit. Also it is hard to line up the shredding unit with the base without pinching your fingers. Come on Fellowes, how about a notch on each side of the shredding unit to easily line it up with the base. I do feel that the shredding units weight is a definite plus though. All in all, very satisfied thus far. It's too soon to comment on it's reliability and length of service. Hopefully those will be positives as well."
4,The Why ISBN 0-9652672-4-5,"This book is exactly its title ""THE WHY"" - The Kenpo Theory. As I would learn new techniques, the question behind the moves would always come into play. This book helps the student learn the sequence behind all of your moves.Some of the subjects Lee explains are: Adjustment of Weapon According to Distance, Circular and Linear Motion, Covering Distance, Increasing Striking Potential, Motion Angular, Situation of Opportunity, Spontaneous Deception, The Blueprints of Kenpo, Torque Principle, Zones of Distance. I find that it is not enough to know the how. Without the why, your movements are just memorized.Lee's ability to explain and demonstrate these theories makes this book a must for your Kenpo Karate collection. Its easy to understand and apply."
4,The Why,"I really enjoyed the details of the concepts, theories and principles. There isn't a lot of material on this. I can apply this book to all my techniques. Its pretty cool."
2,Fishing trip,"Looking for the bits of information in this book is a fishing trip.The thing has too many pictures with too few descriptions. Some pictures are out of order. Several diagrams and medical reference charts are inaccurate or misspelled.There is some information of note, but it's real work finding it."
1,Hardly qualifies as a book,"This book is only 87 pages, but contains about 12 pages of information. Each page is a cheesy diagram or photo with a summary of ideas. It looks like an outline you'd get at a seminar. As hard as I tried, I could not get a few good ideas out of it. The pictures are so poorly organized that I could not even relate the author's thoughts to the photos.All in all, you'd get more ideas out of an article from Black Belt magazine than you would from this whole book."
3,Paul wrote Jesus hanged on tree vs cross of the Gospels,"Glaring discrepancy of ACTS5.30 by Paul saying you[Judeans]had Jesus hanged on tree vs Gospels saying crucifixion by Romans.A tree is not a timber, or a stake[or cross-type]. Jewish folk lore claimed they did it in ""Toledot Jesu"". New Testament Bibles in ACTS connect Paul as a Pharisee, thus a better explanation of why the author thinks Paul was a Sadducee is needed. However, I do agree that the Sadducees were the leaders in the secret trial of Jesus at the high priests house of Caiphas the Sadducee."
1,point of view-bias by the boatload,"It would be easier to believe the ""scholarship"" of a book like this were it not for the blatant bias of the author. It uses similar logic to those who find by random out of context selection of verses the Bible a champion of suicide.1)Judas hanged himself.2)Go thou and do likewise.3)what thou doest, do quickly. All verses found in the Bible, but hardly the message really found there. You would be better off reading Evidence That Demands A Verdict by Josh McDowell, a skeptic who became convinced, rather than a proponent of a point of view slanting ""evidence"" to fit his viewpoint. Don't waste your money."
5,Very good read,"As I get older, I find my curiosity to gets stronger. I have found MacCoby's research to be very strong. I could, after reading the book, almost visualizethat first meeting in Jerusalum between Paul and Peter. I have often wondered what ever happened to Peter, and his leadership, and now I have a better idea. I need to read this book again."
4,"Boots work well, I wish they had a strap that goes across the top","These boots work well out in the mud, until the point that the mud tries to suck your boot off of you :) I wish these boots had a strap of some sort that goes across the top to ensure that they stay on in ""sucky"" conditions. Very WaterProof Material and have kept my feet dry."
4,Received slightly different item,"The listing shows color-coded square drivers -- what I received were 4 drivers all the same color (black). They seem well made, but haven't tried them out. I won't return, but would have preferred the color coded version to make identification easier."
4,"The drives are nice, but not as pictured","The set that I got has screwdrivers with black rubberized handles (not color-coded ones), similar to other Bondhus screwdrivers sold on Amazon. Drive's metal has a nice gray matte finish. I haven't used them much, but they seem to work fine - they fit into screws nicely, and the drive's metal seems to be very hard."
1,Typical MBA approach,"I doubt this guy ever sold much on eBay. In fact, eBay would never have been started had the founders read this guy's book. Might be a good book for helping junior high students understand the basic concepts of business."
4,I'm not,"I sure am trying. Great tips, and hope to be atleast making a part time living doing eBay. It's alot of work, but it's also alot of fun. My photography skills have gotten better. Here is my ""me"" page, hope you like it. Proof is in the pudding:[...]"
4,A Long Awaited Release,"This book is actually edited by my former Creative Writing Professor, (in a later incarnation of the same class from which the book sprung). Dr. Johnson has a talent for seeing quality in other people's stories. If you like scary stories, try these on for size. They are interesting both in content and in cultural elements. It's about time that the literary world started taking Hispanic literature seriously. It has so much more flavor than a lot (not all, but a lot) of what comes out of (my own) WASPish heritage. Try it. You'll like it."
1,A waste of time and money,this is about 3 paragraphs worth of fluff and a statement of the obvious. Was this written for People magazine or a Business magazine. It may not even be worth using it as toilet paper. What a waste of $6. Don't download it. another Amazon rip off.
1,LOBSTER SOUP 27.5 oz / 780 grams by PERARD DU TOUQUET,"It was terrible. It had a consistency like soup but tasted as though it was made with some type of powder. I could barely taste anything that remotely resembled lobster. It's not worth the price, the time, or the effort of purchasing this product."
1,Bad,This is a bad deal and the worst book purchase I have ever made.Very difficult to read because almost every single line was highlighted.
2,CRAFTING AND EXECUTING STRATEGY,IT TOOK A WHILE FOR THE TEXTBOOK TO REACH ME. I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW SLOW THE DELIVERY PROCESS WAS AND ALMOST DIDN'T HAVE THE TEXT IN TIME FOR CLASS. SERVICE AND DELIVERY COULD BE MUCH MORE PROMPT.
2,No tracking number provided,"There was no tracking for my stuff, so I have no control and knowledge of where my package was. Other then that, it's ok"
3,Product Still to be Used,"I will begin using this product next week, and will be in a better position to review it after my six week module."
2,Student Review,"I am a student majoring in Business Administration who recently used this text in an upper-level management course. The book's writing is utterly superfluous. Boredom was frequently my sentiment as I weeded through unnecessarily labyrinthine sentences. The ideas in the book were occasionally interesting, but were usually ideas I had already developed on my own via simple intuition. Perhaps the most valuable part of the text is the section of case studies. This closing segment of the book contains many great ideas for student projects. Overall, this text disappoints me as a student"
3,Does the job but too verbose,"This book is long and verbose with a lot of redundancy. That said, it covers most of the necessary topics required for a business school strategy class. The cases are actually pretty good, though I saw some citations from wikipedia articles, which I think is a bit sloppy. As with many business books these days, the production quality is high, the book is filled with pictures, graphs and plenty of color. However, I worry that this may have been done as an excuse to jack up the price."
4,Great Book!,"Information is very useful. Cases help understanding the material. Although, some companies presented in the cases no longer exist. So if you need to write a review, please make sure you check updated information."
4,The best book every on strategy,I bought this book over 5 years ago but still continue to read it - more when I am doing my MBA at Wharton
4,Bad Shipping Service,"Never again will I buy a product if the shipper is ups, they have failed to deliver me the goods while claiming that they made an attempt even when I've been home all day. Since there's a distribution warehouse nearby, I end up having them hold the package for pickup the next day -very inconvenience on my part. This has happen a few times! After contacting their customer service and speaking to management directly they haven't corrected the issue. This is very disappointing which means if Amazon has them as their only source of option for delivery, loss of sales."
2,Won't come back from Dead Man's Curve.,"In the mid-'70s, a TV movie called ""Dead Man's Curve"" was made about Jan & Dean. They thought they would be unable to get permission to use Jan & Dean's old songs in the movie, so Dean Torrence and his friends rerecorded Jan & Dean's songs, along with several Beach Boys songs. The TV movie eventually did end up using the original versions of Jan & Dean's hits. Anyway, this album features the rerecorded versions of the Jan & Dean and Beach Boys songs. They are far inferior to the original versions. While they try to come as close as possible to the sound of the old records, something is definitely missing. That missing ingredient is Jan Berry, the lead singer and mastermind behind the original recordings. He is totally absent from the proceedings, and that absence is definitely felt. Stick with the Jan & Dean originals from the 1960s."
4,Fair and balanced commentary,I absolutely agree with the theme of this book. I came into the Catholic faith a few years ago in a parish that emphasized social justice above all else and it was a big reason behind my decision to become Catholic. I have since moved and cannot find a parish that makes this central tenet of Christianity a central part of their teachings. It's so sad but perhaps this book can help awaken people to these failings of our religious leaders and demand change.
4,"Mirror, Mirror -- the Christian Right","As Kathleen Kennedy Townsend holds up the mirror with this book, many American Christian denominations won't like what they see. These Christians denominations, the Catholic Church included, are retreating deeper into a quasi-fundamentalism that negates their ability to discourse openly. She regrets that her own Roman Catholic Church has retreated from the openness its 2,400 bishops heralded four decades ago. She is right to do so. The price that church has paid is a vanishing clergy, declining numbers and rising mistrust. Ms. Townsend laments that many Christian denominations today seems less concerned with Good News for the poor than acquiring power to impose their views on one and all."
4,Gives me a boost,"It does give me a boost but I don't think it last for the whole day. Probably a few hours. I am still looking for the best B complex. I take 2 right now because I am up at 4 am, and I have 2 small children, work full time, and I do boot camp at 5 am. Maybe if I didnt have a hectic schedule I would just need 1."
1,Only 1 good song on this CD,"I am sorry but the only great song on this CD is ""Nevertheless, I'm in love with You"". If all the songs on this CD were as good as this one, she'd be a hit! It's terrible what she did to the ""Theme to 2001"". Buy it for the one song or pass on it. She has a great voice, just needs better songs."
5,Excellent quality,Much better quality than what you get at HD and the price is significantly lower than the local plumbing place
3,A nice read,"A light engaging story with believable characters and snappy dialog. Not a lot of tension or emotion, but overall a pleasant read.The plot revolves around two long-time friends, Deb and Reeve, who pretend to be engaged in order to convince Reeve's trustee to release his inheritance. Of course the ""pretend"" engagement takes on a life of its own, and Deb and Reeve soon find themselves being forced down the aisle..."
1,1 cent was too much,"Had I deen what kind of shape this book was in, I wouldn't have paid a penny! I can't even read this book!"
5,Brilliant! Historical slaughter at its best!,Sean Bean is so believable you want to jump and the screen and kill the French at his side just for the glory! And some times his English enemies too!
4,Ana! Review,"I agree with the other reviews, the camera switching is far too often. While it's nice pay respect to the entire band, I bought this to see and hear Ana. Aside from that, it is great and does represent Ana's live show well. It's a must have for Ana fans and recommended for anyone that appreciates talented musicians."
5,sceptic killer,"i must have bought and read every book on network marketing. as a top leader, i think it is critical that you do. i am not surprised this is such a huge seller in europe, its a pity we don't see this guy in the usa or asia"
3,Scratches on the Air Case,"Although this air case seems to protect my palm Z22 very well & I love the fact that it is clear, it gets scratched very very easily. If you keep it in a bag w/ your wallet, keys, phone, etc, it's going to get scratched right away. Now I try to keep it in a separate compartment in my bag, but that's not very convenient.It doesn't make the palm much larger in size & it's cool looking, but just keep in mind that it WILL get scratched."
1,Palm Z22 Air Case waste of money,Comes pre-scuffedhard to openmade of cheap plasticopening at the top for stylus but have to open the case to use it?!!! Dumb.Look elsewere
4,Palm case,I carry the Z22 Palm in my pants pocket and this case helps keep the scratches from the Palm. It shows quite a few scratches on the front but works o.k.
4,Decent simple case,"This case is simple, which is what I wanted.As others have mentioned, the case is pre-scratched. I bought mine in a local electronics store; all of the cases in the store were already scratched, but I wanted something cheap. I took off a star for this, as it is irritating to buy something new that is already damaged.The case fits the Zire 22 quite snugly, and there are openings in the case for the USB/power port and the stylus. I have no problem opening the flip-lid to use the Palm.So all in all, it's an OK product. It does the job of protecting the Palm without a fancy overdone case that adds more bulk to the small Palm."
3,Confused...?,"I'm confused. Everyone says this product is so difficult to open/get into. I find mine almost too easy to get into. Is it broken, or did Palm redesign it based on customer complaints, or what? Pretty much all I do is lift the little latch at the bottom and it opens...so easy it almost feels unsafe. Can someone please clarify this? Did I get a dud?Otherwise it fits well, doesn't add much thickness or weight, and keeps the palm in place even when you open the cover. So you can kind of use it while the case is on, just pull the stylus out, flip the cover up and go. Although, that might be just me because my cover seems suspiciously easy to open. Anyone have any thoughts?"
2,FRAGILE,"This product does protect your palm but if you are not careful with it the hinges break very easy. I'm on my third case in one year. And yes, it does scratch very easily.It's so cheap that I don't mind having to keep replacing it."
2,Good Protection but Fragile Hinge,"This case looks professional and provided adequate protection from occasional spills from my shirt pocket. However the hinge broke within 6 months. If you purchase this over the Flexicase, consider reinforcing the hinge with clear packing tape."
1,Poor item choice,"If all you want is a carrying case that is transparent and UNABLE to use the stylus with the case closed, then this is the perfect item for you(sarcasm).The Palm Z22 Air case states that you are able to use the sylus with the case closed, this was the selling and purchasing point for this item. Problem is, this feature does not work. Affortable, but what is the point if you can not utilize the item for it's selling feature..."
2,Not worth the money,"First off, the packaging and write up for this product give you the impression you can operate it with the case on. Other than charging it and removing the stylus, you can't. You need to flip the case open to use the functions.It does a decent job of protecting the palm from scratches and dings, but the hinges are flimsy and the cover isn't very strong so if you drop it, all bets are off.What gets me the most is that this piece of plastic retails for $19. It probably costs 50 cents to produce. It screamed ripoff from the moment I opened it."
1,"Very disappointed with my two ""Air case""","I recently ordered two ""Air case"" units after reading the product description and looking at the product picture. Sadly, this was my worse purchase in recent years. Reasons:1. Each case has large scratch marks on the flip cover.2. One case's flip cover would not close properly when the Z22 is inside.3. The description ""durable"" is misleading because the case is hard plastic. If I drop it, I am sure there is a high probability of cracking it.4. The description ""lets you use your organizer's functions while safely inside the case"" is misleading because you would need to flip over the cover in order to use the Z22. So where is the safety?Summary: Given that the ""Air case"" is from Palm and my particular units are made in Japan, I would have expected better quality than what I got."
3,hard to open,"maybe i'm the defective one, but it took like 20 minutes for me to figure out how to open it.instructions for y'all's reference:rather than pressing straight up on the tab, press inward, toward the palm pilot."
4,weak hinges,"Probably the best inexpensive case for the z22 but the hinges are weak. One drop and one side broke. Too brittle of plastic for its function/use. Still, I am going to buy another."
4,Very functional but hinge breaks easily,"I purchased the air case at the same time as I purchased my Z22, 9 months ago. I love it. I think it does a great job of protecting the Z22. I don't think a case could be designed to fully protect the Z22 like this does and at the same time allow full access to the screen and buttons. You have to chose which you want - protection or quick access to the screen / buttons.I have dropped my Z22 in this case many times, sometimes even on cement. But my Z22 never broke. Eventually after many drops and being opened many times, the hinge on the air case will break. Despite the hinge breaking, I continue to purchase this case. I usually buy 2 of these at a time so I have a back-up case on hand at all times. The case usually lasts about 9 months.The cover gets scratched as others state here. But you can still read the alarm messages through the cover. After you get used to it, it is very easy to open the cover."
4,"Good, solid protection, weak hinge","The good things about this case:- The material is fairly sturdy, and has held up really well when I've dropped it- It's clear, which is great when you need to just glance at the screen without opening the case- The USB port and stylus are easily accessible, so there's never a need to remove the case- It adds only a small amount of bulk to carry aroundAnd the not-so-good:- Once it's in the case, the Palm can be a bit hard to remove...I have to use a good amount of force to get it out, which is obviously a nuisance- As has been mentioned, the hinge is unreliable and comes off easily (though, if opened and closed gently, this isn't such a huge problem).Overall, I'd definitely recommend this as it's definitely kept my Palm safe and is completely convenient to use/carry regularly."
1,The case needs another case to protect it!,"While this case will indeed protect the Palm, it can easily be damaged if dropped. Thus, one of the hinges on the cover of the case cracked after a drop or a bump in my backpack. The case is now a two-piece and I'm in the market for something that might last longer than four months. Look elsewhere."
1,Not good if you use your palm a lot,I bought one of these to protect my Palm however I use my z22 for booking appointments and I literally struggled with getting this thing opened and it was a nuisance every time- with a customer on the phone waiting for me to get the stupid thing open. I returned it.
2,Air Case for Palm Z22,"I was looking for something more flexible, this is hard plastic. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to the description."
4,Useful and easy to use.,"I bought this cover and one other for my wife to use with her new Palm Z22 and this one won out. It's simple design, top hinge and see through material makes it a winner all around.Other cases I've seen usually have the hinge on the left and that can sometimes make it difficult to use the device for lefties. This one has the hinge at the top so it's great for both righties and lefties."
3,"Does the job, but.........","I agree with many of the other reviewers that the hinge is too weak and the latch is too strong (odd combo). Otherwise, it does its job perfectly, and I doubt there's a better case out there for a man who likes to carry the Z22 in his back pocket. However, I did deduct a star each for the strong latch and weak hinge."
5,Great protection from dirt and scratches,"This Z22 Air Case is made of clear acrylic. It fits the Z22 perfectly and adds only a tiny amount to the size of the device. I have used it for 2 months so far, and it protects my Palm from the dirt and scratches of sliding around in my purse. The hinges are holding up just fine as is the closing tab. It flips open easily and closes securly. I even attached the grafitti help stickers that came with the Z22 the the inside of the case lid so I can reference quickly."
2,Buy the Timbuk2 case instead,"After looking at reviews for this case and the air case for the Z22, I wasn't impressed by either. The air case either opens too easily or not easily enough, the metal case gets scratched up and opens on the left side (which is awkward for a right-handed or small-handed person), and neither one protects the charger port on the palm. I found a case by Timbuk2 called the 2way that holds my palm PERFECTLY. It's made from ballistic fabric, has room for cards and straps to a backpack or purse strap. It's lightweight and secures with velcro. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to protect their palm in style without paying a lot or getting a case not made for the z22 that doesn't fit.Here are links to Timbuk2's product:http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords;=2way+timbuk2&x;=0&y;=0http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/accessories/accessory-cases/2way"
5,Pefect Function and Fit,The Palm 3225WW Air Case for the Z22 Handheld is perfect. It protects my Palm from sharp and abrasive items in my pockets and from my Palm getting crushed. All the functions of the Palm can be used with it in the case. Putting the palm in and taking it out of the protective case is very easy. Not sure why so many of these reviews comment that that the Air Case is hard to open unless mine is somehow defective. Mine opens very easily when needed. This is a must purchase for any one wanting to use the Z22 on the go and likes carry lots of junk in their pockets that normally would damage a PDA.
4,Air case,"I really like this case. It is easy to get into and out of your pocket when you need it. The only problem that I see is that it gets scratched easily. But, I guess its better the case than the Palm."
4,Good book,"A good book to read in the criminal justice system. May be a little old, still functional with today's facilities, and cj system. I recomend this book."
1,not as expected,THIS BOOK IS AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS. WANTED A BOOK THAT EXPLAINED HOW TO DO MANY PROJECTS. THIS SHOWS PICTURES OF COMPLETED PROJECTS BUT DOES NOT SHOW HOW .EXAPLE A PICTURE OF A KALEIDOSCOPE BUT HAS NO EXPLAINATION OF HOW DO DO IT.IN ORDER TO PRINT OUT MANY PROJECTS YOU NEED TO PURCHASE OTHER SOFTWARE.WANTED TO DO A MONTAGE BUT FOUND OUT AFTER I ORDERED BOOK YOU NEED TO PURCHASE ARC SOFT.
3,Deutsche Kulturgeschichte,"All in german, the book I got was heavily marked, but the book itself seems to have good content and is helpful."
5,kids love it,"My 6 and 3 year olds both love this book and ask me to read it over and over and over again. We have several books from this series and love them all, but this is the one that they get out the most and ask me to read to them. Its not really tailored for a 3 year old, but mine is absolutely fascinated with it!Its got some funny/cute pictures. For example, my kids think its hilarious that in his bathroom medicine cabinet, he has 'Fangpaste'"
5,Neat Little Series,"Our kids love this book and many others in the series. Our 7th grade science teacher at school has even used this one to explain concepts to the kids. I would also recommend:What Is the World Made Of? All About Solids, Liquids, and Gases (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science, Stage 2)"
5,A DROP OF BLOOD,"WHAT YOU SEE, IS WHAT I GOT. VERY HELPFUL FOR THE PROJECT THAT I USED IT FORA Drop of Blood (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)"
5,Awesome!,"My kid and I love this book! It's perfect for the monster loving 4 year old who's curious about the world inside them, not to mention the great pictures. Very fun read."
2,Who Compiled This?,"The score for Chain Reaction that is actually heard in the movie is great.The high point is the rousing,exciting cue heard during the chase through the streets of Chicago,leading to the draw-bridge.For reasons that I will never know,this music is not included on the soundtrack.Neither is the music played during the end credits-very similar to the aforementioned chase music-included on this soundtrsck.The only thing that comes close is ICE CHASE,but it isn't as good.Instead you get to hear that annoying guitar sound that's played during the scenes that focus on Keanu Reeves.Astoundingly,despite its ommisions,this CD is only 30 minutes long.You'd be best off just recording the music directly from the movie."
3,Touching Reaction,"The score to ""Chain Reaction"" is perhaps one of the most passive works composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The action cues are average, especially 'Ice Chase', in which you can feel that Goldsmith might be tired. Fortunately he later wrote something similar but better in ""Air Force One."" However this album is worth a listen because of the cues 'Meet Eddie', 'Open Minds' and 'Out Of The Hole'. 'Meet Eddie' presents the main title of this score where the trumpet plays a wonderful leitmotif to the Keanu Reeves character, and the synthesizers help the orchestra's performance skillfully. But pay attention to the end of the cue called 'Open Minds' where the french horn -one of Goldsmith's apparently favorite instruments- play a beautiful and touching melody that, if you hum it, tears may come out of your eyes. This is an interesting effort by Jerry Goldsmith, if not great. But you can take the chance of buying this album for the three cues I mentioned above."
5,A Truly Great (Unheralded) Album,"I have been an avid Jane fan since the release of their first album in 1972. In my opinion, Age of Madness is kept from being my favorite of all the group's albums only by Fire, Water, Earth & Air. The most distinctive quality of Age of Madness is its crawling, slowly building crescendo of rolling rhythms that make this album more Pink Floydian than the group's other releases. Though not as bluesy as Together or as Allman-like as Fire, Water, Earth & Air, I think any Jane fan will love the rich textures of Age of Madness. This is just another or those really great albums that has been consistently high-priced and difficult to find since its release."
4,I Love it!,"This gazebo is a wonderful addition to my deck. After purchasing the product, we were able to use it within 2-3 hours. It seems to be very sturdy and spacious. It has brought new life to my back yard."
2,Tivoli Gazebo,"We purchased this Gazebo last year and when we took it down in September, the top came apart in our hands from sun rot.How can I get a replacement.Love the whole gazebo, can't believe it only lasted one Chicago summer season.Connie VitaleSchaumburg, IL"
2,Tivoli Gazebo from Target,"I loved this gazebo when I first got it. The first season was wonderful, the second season(last year), it started to rip from the sun and wind. I patched it this year and it only lasted three days and literally shredded apart.I would not recommend this for long term. I will look for another brand."
2,lasted 1 summer,"i bought this gazebo for our first house july 2009. The first set was missing holes so i exchanged it.5 or 6 months pregnant, i put it together myself. it has these nice shelves in each corner. i put 6 bricks in each one. gazebo lasted the summer, held up well to rain and very high winds. i kept begging my husband to take it apart for the winter, he didnt. it held up through a big snow storm, canopy still intact. i went out and used a stick to push snow off the roof/canopy. STILL STANDING. so i promise myself, the next day with tolerable weather i will take it apart. the nice day came and i forgot. so one light windy day in november, i look out the window and that gazebo was warped, buckled sideways on the ground and dead."
1,gone with the wind,"Like everyone else. My wife and I liked the stylings of this gazebo, and like everyone else had this gazebo anchored down and had 100 lbs. additional weight to help keep it anchored. Yes, and like everyone else I came home to find the gazebo wrapped over my fence and part of the gazebo had seperated and struck my neighbor's house; breaking a window. Needless to say I doubt this gazebo can hold up to any winds above 10 mph. looks great but won't last."
2,Not worth the time,"Pompous, patronizing, hypocritical - this book is all surface and no depth. Its too bad the author used so much energy to write it. The author is immersed in self in each vignette, thus sees his characters in only two dimensions. He sees his islands with the same perspective as the Luddites. It could have been a wonderful read."
5,Author Michael Tougias,"Tom Clavin has done a fine job with a riveting narrative of the events before, during and after the accident with the Pelican. It must have been incredibly difficult to research this tragedy which took place in 1951, but the author brings it to life in a very readable and informative style.When I was writing Ten Hours Until Dawn it was challenging enough because the sea rescue and tragedy I was writing about was 28 years old, so to think Tom Clavin made an event 54 years old read like it happened yesterday is really amazing.Dark Noon is a must read for anyone who likes adventure, history, and maritime lore."
5,"A beautiful CD, deserving a home in your collection...","I've owned copies of this album for several years, and just bought my another, since friends who hear it permanently borrow it. We're taking it to hospital with us for the birth of our first child. I've used it during Music Therapy sessions with patients that I've worked with who have severe developmental disabilities, with great results! We have a tradition of playing this CD first on Christmas morning. The music is soothingly serene, yet ripe with energy. So many ""music with nature sounds"" recordings are trite, but this brings the combination together with simple elegance. You'll turn to it again and again."
3,Very sparse and simple,"This CD is mainly a solo flute, very sparse sounding and very simple. There's some nature sounds but they aren't really integrated into the music, they're just ""there."" Judging by the other reviews, I thought this would be a richer, more melodic CD. Instead it's just a single flute playing pretty songs without any enhancements. If that's what you enjoy, you will probably love this. I personally prefer music that is more than one simple instrument being played. (My favorite Native American CD is How the West Was Lost by Peter Kater and R. Carlos Nakai.)"
3,Fair but only a collection of short articles,"The book has good advice, but it's just a collection of Mike's short articles. I would recommend Mike's DVD ""Do We Teach What We See"". His Rotational Hitting Mechanics are on the money - the best I've seen. He breaks it down into simple motions to understand and teach. Start with the DVD then buy the book, then the articles in the book make more sense. Ted William's book ""The Science of Hitting"" is of value too if you want to understand Rotational Hitting Mechanics - but doesn't go into detail how to teach it - Mike's stuff does! ""Beginners thru Little League - Explosive Rotational Hitting"", shows some fun drills to help teach Rotational Mechanics, but Mike Epstein's stuff is where to start...use the ""Explosive"" DVD to help drill Mike's techniques."
3,It's okay,"It is an older dvd, set in the 90's. It does give drills that can be used today. I would recommend to parents for the instruction of the game."
3,Technical Baseball,Mike Epstein knows what he is talking about! The book is very informative and backs up the theory of rotational hitting. I like the troubleshooting section but the early parts of the book could use some illustrations. My younger guys have a tough time without a pic. The book is more written towards instructors.
1,His CD is terrible-STAY AWAY,"The method is what every power hitter in the Majors uses in one way or another.Its really Ted Williams method. But Mike has laid it out specifically on how to do it.His CD ""Hit Your Potential in just 7 Days"" has technical problems. Does not work with all operating systems. Beware. Factory is no help at all. Apparently Mike doesn't run the business but his son...."
2,Horrible writing,"I suspect the author knows about hitting but just can't write. He randomly and liberally quotes, italicizes, and capitalizes. He organizes poorly, explains badly, postures incessantly, and tries to sell us his other products excessively.This book has all the subtlety of an Amway pitch. Give it a miss and tryThe Louisville Slugger Complete Book of Hitting Faults and Fixes : How to Detect and Correct the 50 Most Common Mistakes at the Plateinstead."
5,"Clear, Concise, Interesting (for theory, that is)","I was assigned this book in class! Loved it. I hate theory, but this book made sense and was interesting to read. I think the book has great examples that are real life. For those of you who hate theory or don't understand it, this book will help you understand that theory is all around.Great job!"
1,"Worked for three weeks, and the microphone on the speakerphone died.","This phone worked great for about three weeks, and then yesterday, the microphone on the speaker started to work flakily. It now works less than 25% of the time, and will sometimes cut out in the middle of a call. Additionally, sometimes when I try dialing a number it doesn't register the phone number and will eventually receive an off-the-hook signal. If I hang up and hit redial it will dial fine. The phone also does not have caller id which I would have expected on a phone for this price."
3,don't drop the handset!!!,This phone works okay. Don't drop the handset unless you want to have to replace it.
5,945 speakerphone ... if I'd gotten it,"I ordered a 945 and received a 1040 which had to be returned because it was not compatible with our 900 series telephone system. The shipper did pay return shipping, but why didn't they contact us before sending what we did not order?"
4,Good basic phone,"It will do the job, for a basic office. Very sturdy, will take the abuse from the ""girls"" banging phone , spilling coffee."
2,"Menken's Music Offers Mediocrity, not Magic","The newest album from Menken, one of the most established composers of his time, comes with great expectations, but not so great results. It lacks the ingenuity that usually encompasses his music, the originality and flavor that brought him his well deserved fame in the Disney classics. The new pieces that he presents lack the chemistry between prose and instrumentation that is characteristic of most of his music. Debbie Shapiro Gravitte's enchanting voice seems out of place in the bleak new pieces. Overall, the album does little to raise the plateau of standards that Menken has achieved."
3,Christian Rock,"It is so hard to really imagine the stakes within the music industry today. Unfortunately, I could wish the same thing about certain performers. Also, there are some songs from others that make the industry worth all the while. Creed is one of them. The feel of religion in the music makes the feeling a whole lot more unbelieveable. Their song, My Sacrifice, the third single from Weathered, conflicts meeting within yourself for a better look at life. Although the song was important at first, but when you hear it too much, it just kind of drowns itself out into an oblivion. All that I can say to Scott Stapp and the rest of Creed is that they have to keep the music going for new challenges. Hopefully they can try to do that with another smash record."
4,"A great song, with a point...","The first single from Creed's hit album, ""Weathered"", is My Sacrifice. The song itself is fantastic, with a powerful sound and great vocals.But the part of this song that stands is the story it tells. It talks of two friends meeting after years of not seeing each other, and when listened to closely makes you think quite deeply.A winner both in airplay and in getting the message across! For fans of Creed this is a must have single, and includes the video clip to the song, which only adds to the stort being expressed in the music."
5,Chameleons For Beginners,"If you've never heard the beauty that was The Chameleons, this CD is a perfect sampling. This CD contains the definitive versions of Chams songs which are all overflowing with pain, beauty, strength, depth, intensity and energy. The music = one ghostly swirling guitar drowning the other staccato guitar, driving bass and drums and sensitive, genuine, angst filled existential lyrics along with excellent production. What more could you ask for? It's just so unfortunate that this CD is so prohibitively priced (but *very* worth it!). This is thee best band in the world. Try them."
4,A good compilation by a great band,"This one is a great way to check out The Chameleons. The classics are there, Swamp Thing and Second Skin, along with Tears, and of course In Shreds.If you can, get the copy with the 2nd disk. The Bsides seem rather mediocre at the moment. But if you love the Chameleons, you'll want to have it. They are yet to grow on me, but then I didn't take to 'What Does Anything Mean?', and now love that album.The Chameleons are a timeless band, one that got me through some pretty tough times. Get their stuff if you can. Get it!!!!Oh, P.S. That B-sides disk to Return of the Roughnecks is actually pretty good."
4,A Practical Introduction to the Theology of Worship,"I recently watched as a church board wrestled with aspects of worship practice. They were decideing how often to offer communion. They decided to poll their congregation. They were interested in what sort of music to offer. They decided to poll their congregation. They had questions concerning cantatas, special concerts, liturgical dancing, and drama. Each time, they decided to find out what their congregation wanted.Such a church may become very popular, but it has not discovered what worship is nor why it should be done. Webber's book doesn't ignore historcial or contemporary forms of whorship, but it does try to lay a solid foundation that there is theology in worship.This book is not the last word on the subject, but it offers a good introduction to worship theology."
3,Not the band,"The band is much better than the book. Check out the songs, ""of sins and shadows"", ""Inferno(Unleash the fire)"", and you cant go wrong with any song of the Paradise Lost album. Yep, far superior to this book."
3,Ace's Greatest Hits Live,"Even thought this CD sounds good, it's the same live recordings taken from his 12 Picks Greatest Hits and Loaded Deck CDs. If you already have these 2 CDs don't bother buying this one, but if you just want some live Ace it's good."
1,Just like Kiss of recent years.............,"Milking the back cataloge for all it's worth. I don't have the album myself but it appears to be all the live songs from the 12 Picks & Loaded Deck album, although it would appear that this album like the other two had little if any input from Ace himself. I'm still waiting for the ""new album that should be out in the fall"". That was the fall of '95"
4,Nice package. High quality vinyl,"I'm doing a review for the vinyl picture discs issue of Ace Frehley's Greatest Hits Live.The package is very nice and is pressed onto some pretty thick, high quality vinyl. At least 180 gram. Pics on each disc are really cool looking. If you're a collector, like I am, then don't hesitate on this one. It's not all that easy to locate to begin with and the free S&H; from Amazon makes it a great deal."
2,unnecessary release,"actually this is a rip off, commercialy spoken and I regret buying it, too hastily, eager waiting for new material, which it isn't. Not even the packaging is new. Before 2 compilationalbums were released, ""12 Picks"" and ""Loaded Deck"" and all the songs stem from those compilations. Earlier an original band live EP (on vinyl) has seen the daylight ""4 + 1"", four live tracks and a new studiotrack. They are already present on the aforementioned compilations. So why this album? Finally despite its title not all songs are from live performances: ""One plus one"" and ""Give it to me anyway"" are just plain studiorecordings. So nothing is gained by releasing or buying an album like this. Stick to ""12 Picks"" and/or ""Loaded Deck"" CDs and you have all the goods. Only for those who cannot afford these other CDs might it have to offer a bit."
3,"""Best?"" I don't think so...","Not a bad collection, but it's the concept of ""Best Gay Erotic Ficiton"" that I object to. Does the editor really expect us to believe that fully a quarter of the best gay erotica published last year appeared in just two magazines (InTouch and Indulge) owned by one publisher? Or that one writer (Bob Vickery, who is good) is responsible for a sixth of the best porn? Missing are any of the other topflight queer authors found in, say, Best Gay Erotica or Best American Erotica, and the mass-market magazine source of these stories makes for a certain uniformity of style and narrative approach. A lot of the stories are fun, few are revelations, and if the publisher had subtitled it ""Good Stuff from Some of the Stroke Magazines"" it would have been more accurate."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!,"To any filmscore lover, you MUST have this soundtrack.. I am a big fan of John Williams' music and must tell you, this is one of the few scores that reach Williams' brilliant caliber. The main theme is lyrical and sweet as well as nostalgic and poetic. Do not think twice about this one. NOW is the time to enjoy it!"
4,One of Several Recordings of this Score.....,"Undoubtedly TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a masterpiece score, and no small thanks goes to orchestrators Leo Shuken and Jack Hayes. In addition to this fine (but rather over-produced Varese recording) is the Mainstream CD re-issue of the original Ava LP release. Sadly not only is the Mainstream CD deleted, but it was missing one track and several other tracks have become distorted, perhaps due to improper storage. Screen Archives currently offer a 1970's re-recording as part of an 11 CD set, this one with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, also conducted by Bernstein. I recommend this as closest to the original, other than the actual Ava LP."
5,One of the most beloved film scores ever.,"Consider yourself a serious film score collector? If so, there are certain film scores which must be in your collection. This is one of them. Not only does this score contain one of the most beautiful melodies ever written for film, it is also Elmer Bernstein's greatest work. In TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, Bernstein does an incredible thing. He imagines a world through the eyes of a child and skillfully succeeds in bringing it to life. This is not, necessarily, childhood the way it is but more childhood the way we remember it; with all it's joy and sadness, playfullness and pain. In the history of film music, rarely, if ever, has anyone written such an emotionally resonant work. This is truly a masterpiece. You are not allowed to miss it."
2,This manual is vague and incomplete.,"I suppose this book is fine for those people who aren't going to attempt to do more than change the oil or maybe replace the brake shoes. I've found that anything more than that is either skipped over or mentioned only in passing. For example, the section on installing the intake manifold consists only of a picture of the manifold. The fault diagnosis sections aren't terribly helpful either. A few possibilities per symptom are listed, but they are very vague, for example, ""mechanical damage."" Occasionally you will find a helpful bit of information, but for the most part this book is a waste of money."
1,Not for a Novice,I am rebuilding a 1966 Mustang with no prior experience. This book did not even get me to the point that I was able to identify the parts of my carburetor and determine what steps I need to take to replace it. This book is for someone with great mechanical knowledge...to the point that they would not need this manual anyway.
1,Useless,Don't waste your time or money with this book. There is barely any actual information in this book on the Mustang. It's mostly contains all the other generic information found in the other manuals. Save yourself some frustration and order the Ford factory service manual and the Osborne assembly diagrams instead from a vintage Mustang parts supplier.
1,save your money,"i've yet to find a useful Haynes manual, famous Haynes quote ""installation is the reverse of removal""."
4,Good reference book,"This book has great illustrations and references. Don't expect to buy any book and instantly be able to fix your car without any mechanical knowledge. I have a degree in mechanics and I found this book to be very helpful while rebuilding my classis mustang. The wiring schematics could be much better, but those can be found online. Torque specs/sequences and general specs are listed and easy to find. Overall a great book."
2,outdated,"just bought this book at autozone. i make it a habit to buys these books as soon as i get a new vehichle. the ones (chilton & haynes) ive had in the past for my s-10s, were pretty decent. flipping thru this its apparent nobody has updated the pictures (all 3 of em) in 40 yrs. it reminds me of the vague books n movies we had to look at in shop class, from the 1950s. small, black & white pictures of the general area of work, not the part itself, & surely not the step by step removal. i plan on getting the chilton as well, hopefully itll be better. save your money!"
4,Great for the Futures Clueless,"I received the 1997 edition, NOT the 2000...therefore my comments are based on the earlier edition. I enjoyed the book as it is a very easy read and could more appropriately be titled 'Futures 100: An Orientation', as the author does exactly what he promises to do and that is to introduce the reader to the world of Futures. I read it in one day and would recommend it to anyone who is eager to learn about Futures. Waldron does provide a couple of interesting examples of success in trading, but more knowledge should be ascertained. He also offered additional resources to assist the reader with their journey for more information regarding concepts, research and trading.I would recommend this reading if your only interpretation of Futures are multiple tomorrows :-)"
4,Future 101: An Introduction to Commodiy Trading(1999 Edition,It explains commodity trading in a very simple way.This book taught me more than I could ever manage by poring over numerous web sites.A very good book for beginners.
1,it's OK if you only want an extremely basic overview,"This book only touches on the very basic elements of commodities trading. It would more appropriately be titled Futures 099. If you have any aspirations of trading in the commodities markets and want more than a very superficial understanding of how those markets work, this is not the book for you."
1,For Rank Beginners or Grade School Students.,"If you have no experience in any market, this book is for you. Takes 2 hours to read/skim. I learned a little about the background of commodities. Book is also annoying to read because of it's unorthodox style of font (block lettering), strange page layout (Sentences are sometimes indented in a ladder-style, like poetry), and repeating of information. Find a meater text."
4,Leave Hillary out of it!!!!,"I truly enjoyed 95% of this book and found it to be an incredibly simply written and easily understandable beginning text. My only complaint is that there is a multi-page (17 page) examination of Hillary Clinton's commodity investments of the late 70's, during which Waldron does some of the most partisan campaigning that I have ever read. I dont know whether she did anything wrong or not. Frankly, not reall interested. But please stop telling me how innocent she is. Other than that--really good book."
1,disappointed,"exceptionally bad e-book format. just plain text. almost no formatting & no chapters to jump to.content is ok, but most of what you will find, you can easily learn yourself on wikipedia."
3,A good general overview of commodity futures trading.,"This book is for those who know nothing or virtually nothing about commodity futures. If you already know even a little about commodity futures, this book is not for you. It is just a foundation. You will not be ready to trade commodity futures after you read this book (and the author does not pretend that you will be), but you will be ready to go on to more in-depth research. The book is light, quick reading."
3,Pumping Apparatus Driver Operator,"Typical IFSTA book, with (IMHO) some concepts being poorly explained or only partly explained (especially in the formulas section), leading to confusion and necessity for further research. Book should be a reference as well as book that can be used to follow along with class PowerPoint session."
2,Get his other CDs instead,This is okay but it is not the sterling brilliant work Charlap does on his three previous efforts at all. Get any of those instead of this one. Get Stardust. Get Somewhere. Get Written in the Stars. Any and all of those three instead of this one. Another warning...this Gershwin one has the annoying Copy Control demon on it so when you load it onto your mp3 it skips and jumps. most annoying. whatever happen to fair use by people who buy the music????
3,Charlap and Gershwin,"Bill turns out another fine recording. His technique and style are excellent. I thought his song selection was fine and the addition of Slide Hampton,Phil Woods etc. added to the CD. I still miss Bill Evans but Bill Charlap is at the top of his game."
2,Really Gershwin ?,Mr Charlap is to go without saying excellent. I got the recommendation from the New York Times---but---It shows the importance of listening to a disc before you purchase it. My preference is smooth jazz. The person who reviewed this disc has different taste in music than I do and the fault is mine. I'll donate the disc to the local library.
4,Still cookin' decades later,I first saw what became the Allman Brothers back in the late 60's. They were a Pop/R&B band called the Hourglass. They had a couple albums and if I remember a minor hit. Then they disappeared and came back as the Allman Brothers. Boy what a fun band to listen too and sweat in a garage playing their tunes with friends. This CD still has the essesnse of the Allman Brothers and won't disappoint. They are America's great jam band.
2,A Disappointment,"The songs here are lackluster and Greg sounds weary. If you want to hear something with some fire in it, buy the new Derek Trucks CD, or better yet, the new Led Zeppelin live DVD and CD. It'll knock you off your feet!"
4,Sweet sounds of the south,"The latest ABB lineup is outstanding, same tight rhythms and outstanding guitar work. Derek and Warren are both slide guitar virtuosos, but I miss what Dickie Betts brings to the table. On the downside, Greg's voice isn't as strong as it used to be. But he hasn't lost his songwriting ability, there are some memorable tunes on this one. If you're an ABB fan, you'll want this CD."
4,New CD worth buying,This new cd is fantastic...This band is still very good without Dickey...If you want to hear the country influenced songs of Dickey then this is not for you...This cd is more bluesy and Jazzy influenced...But it stands on its own..The Jamming interplay between Derek trucks and Warren Haynes is great and Greggs vocals are the best he has been in years...Its to Bad Dickey and the Band had a parting of ways..But Mr Betts has a new band that is every bit as good as the Allmans ...Dickey Betts and great Southern check them out they jam as well..We now have two bands to see and hear..Hittin the note is worth the buy..Dickeybetts.com Check out Great Southerns new cd also
4,"4-1/2 stars! Allmans ""got it"" this time","Without a doubt this is the best album I have bought in quite some time. Although the local rock station in my area may not play a single song, the album is chock-full of very good material. Songs like ""Firing Line"", ""High Cost of Low Living"", and my personal favorite ""Who to Believe"" prove this group still has ""it"". Guitar playing rocks at the end of High Cost and Greg's singing sounds great throughout. While this one sounds less country/southern rock influenced (minus Betts), it has more of a blues rock feel the Allmans are also known for. I think someone in the band said this was the ""best album since Eat a Peach"". Gotta agree."
3,Good stuff,Good disk but lacking a little in the riff power thier last studio disk had (Where It All Began)... but any new Allmans is better than no Allmans ...
3,Just goin' thru the motions,"Say what you like about Warren Haynes, but he AIN'T Dickey Betts. All the band known as the ""Allman Brothers Band"" now just consists of Gregg, Jaimoe, and Butch. There's an excellent bassist, but some kid and Haynes having the unmitigated gall to stand where Duane and Dickey once stood doesn't an ""Allman Brothers Band"" album/cd make. Like the Rolling Stones: Give it up, guys."
3,Where Art Thou Dickie Betts (Y'all),"A nice try from the Peachtree Macon boys (how many still remain from those days?), and yes, Greg still sounds like the sad, introspective lost soul of the Brothers glory days. But, is he for real, especially with the bucks deluxe he must have from the constant touring (They can't be making much on their albums anymore)over the last 25 years? We don't want Greg ""Hittin' the Note"" too accurately now, do we? This may tarnish his image, and we all know he's ""no angel"". Dickie Betts...we miss your crystaline guitar high notes, your clarity of a diamond fills and the sparkling clear emotion eeking out from between your fingers and the fretboard. ""Hittin' the Note"" is a nice, but cloudy return to form as ""Melissa"" awaits her ""Blue Sky""."
1,you've got to be kidding,"Are Warren and Derek fine guitar players? Of course. Is Butch trucks the best drummer in rockdom? Probably. Oteal and Marc Quinones aren't exactly chopped liver, either. BUT this album lacks any semblance of melodic innovation which defines true art in music and historically set the Brothers apart. The complexities of Dickey's anguished reaching for the sublime is conspicuously absent. This album is safe, predictable, workmanlike and ultimately, mundane. The Allman Brothers Band no longer exists. It's the Warren Haynes Band."
4,"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: ""AS A PUBLIC SERVICE I SAY CHECK YOUR OTHER ALLMAN BROTHERS FIRST!""","This will be the shortest review I write and I'm just doing it as a friend would do for another friend. This is a very good CD, but if you're an Allman Brother fan, check your existing collection of Allman Brothers CD's first. I didn't look closely when I bought this CD; (My prior Allman Brother purchase was ""One Way Out"".) And 6 songs on this CD out of 11 (That's 54.5%) were on ""One Way Out""! You'll thank me in the morning. God Bless! Good Night! Shaq has left the building."
3,"Good album, but far from their classic work","This is a solid release from one of rock's all-time classic bands. But, it pales in comparison to their truly great work. Any Allman Brother purists will agree... THEY ARE NOT THE SAME WITHOUT DICKEY BETTS. Warren Haynes is an excellent guitarist, and Derek Trucks plays slide as well as anyone can in the shadow of Duane, but the Allman Brothers are not the same. One listen to Dickey's playing on ""2nd set"" will show you what they are/were capable of. Any other band I would give this 4 stars, but as an avid fan of the Brothers, I can only give it 3 stars knowing what they have been in the past."
3,generally does hit the note,"this is Derek Truck's first studio album with ABB. If you enjoyed the Duane Allman/Dickey Betts guitar combo, you will dig Haynes/Trucks here."
3,"A solid, professional effort.","Lots of spark here, without ever setting a real blaze. Greg Allman is really starting to sound like a tired old man, which is of course perfect because that's exactly what he has been aiming for all along. Warren Haynes is the engine these days, and while he may not be the most original guitarist or vocalist, he's a real pro and knows his way around the Standard Allman Brothers Guitar Solo. Haynes' youthful counterpart (and drummer Butch Trucks' nephew), Derek Trucks, is usually too understated here to be truly effective - but he manages to be inoffensive and stay out of Haynes' way, which apparently were his marching orders. If Trucks grows up a bit by the next session and challenges Haynes more, this could all get interesting again, rather than merely pleasant."
4,WOW Teddy can ramble,"Interesting book, it appears to have been written as if Teddy Baseball were speaking into a tape recorder. Strange at times but VERY enjoyable!!"
5,The Mig-29 Encyclopaedia,"This book virtually got everything you want to know about this fighter jet. Mig 29 Fulcrum is one of the best fighter jet in the world and it was also the most feared conventional weapon by the Western world during the cold war.Yefim Gordon's expertise in (USSR) Russia's military aviation is unsurpassed to-date. This book illustrates how the Mig 29 came about into existence, its development over the years, all the variants with a lot of detail background information. If USSR still exists, this book would be classified as one of the top secret of the Soviet Air Force.Apart from the wealth of content, the pictures are very rare and valauble, the colour-plates are outstanding and the drawings are very informative.I have read several good books on Mig 29 but this one is the best ever. After reading this one, you don't need to look for another book on Mig 29."
2,Unoriginal and unhelpful,"Nothing new here. Platitudes and only the most basic of inspirations and exercises. Maybe good for someone who's never heard the adage, ""Do something you love."" A real disappointment. Stick with ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" for more inspirational and useful advice."
