3,Great 80's movie! But was this DVD made politically correct?,"I have always LOVED this movie.Bought it right away when it came out on dvd.But was very disapointed with the final product.Too many scenes were left out. One in particular is the one where Stacy(Jennifer Jason Leigh) gets the abortion,why skip over that. During that time that was a ballsy thing to put in a movie!Hopefully this SE Fast Times will be much better!"
5,Good stuff,I thought it was very nice. Especially the part when the fish delivery guy got caught in the bathroom fantasizing. It kind of reminds me of an embarrassing moment I had in the dressing room at a lingerie shop in the Mall. I could only laugh when Pheobe Cates walked in on him. She's very nice.
4,This DVD does NOT have any scenes changed!,"Someone posted a review saying that this DVD had some scenes missing, particularly those of Eric Stoltz. Hey dude, he's all over the place! He's the guy with long red hair who hangs out with Spicoli. He's got several scenes. That reviewer also mentioned problems with audio synchronization. Not on the dvd I rented, bud! Perhaps this guy got a hold of some copy that was sold to some other country and re-edited and dubbed. That can be the only excuse because this DVD has all the scenes in tact, the audio is fine, and the commentaries by Heckerling and Crowe are great fun and will point out where you can peek at Stoltz and other soon-to-be-famous dudes like Forest Whitaker and Nicolas Cage. Seriously man, this DVD totally has it all (pizza optional)!"
4,Great Music Accompanies 'Fast Times',"I don't know how I initally got turned on to this movie, but I'm glad I did. Sure, it could've toned down it's content a bit, but it also gives a good example of growing up around friends in high school, and the pressures that accompany that time in a person's life. I would not suggest showing this film to a small child, but it's good fun for the more mature. Judge Rinehold, and Sean Penn are both terrific in their rolls, and the film has some really funny moments. However, in my opinion, most notably should be that this movie is a soundtrack for the early 1980's. Some fantastic music is to be found in the movie, such as ""Raised On The Radio"" and Jimmy Buffett's ""I Don't Know (Spicoli's Theme)"". It should be noted that 'Fast Times' gave Jackson Browne his biggest hit record with ""Somebody's Baby"". This is the epitome of suburban California....kind of a Riverdale High of the '80's.GOD BLESS YOU !"
4,It's a very good movie!,"Fast times at Ridgemont high,it's one of my best movie i've seen!My favorite character is Jeff Spicoli be cause he is very funny and also he is not very fast!If I compare High school of this time with today,I found that it's the same thing but,it's just then the students looks likes more free!In conclusion,Fast times at Ridgemont high is a great sucess for the enterprice of cinema!Gabriel Hudon Montreal,Qc"
4,A good movie,"I think is a good movie, just a little dirty but it's find. jeje The movi have a good representation of the live in the high school.My favorite character is Stacy. Whi?? because i think to in the end of the movie, she's undestand that what she's done was bad by herself. I think today is a little bit mines crazy than in the time of the movie. I recomend you to seen the movie."
4,Spicoli is the best actor OF THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The movie is very good because some parts are exellent but some times their is some parts of the movie that are not good . But the movie is good because Jeff Spicoli makes almost all the good scenes of the movie.My favorite actor is Jeff Spicoli because he is related to some teenagers life.The movie is good but the movies of today are better because their is more action , their are some better actors.IN conclusion Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of the best movie I have ever seen but the movies of today are better!"
5,Good movie,This is a fun movie to watch. It takes me back to my high school years. I like the music that is played in the movie.
2,DVD has scenes changed,"I was disappointed with the DVD of this movie, mainly because it was missing scenes I expected to see. I could not find Eric Stoltz' scenes, for example. Apparently they were cut. Surely they could have included cut scenes as a menu option. Other DVD's have this feature. Also the sound is monaural and my SONY player experienced its infamous lipsync problem in parts of this DVD."
4,"Man, this movie brings back memories!","Im a child of the 80's (Yikes!!) Man, this movie brings back memories. It's not a masterpiece or anything, just lots of fun to watch. Say, what is the deal with all the postings from Montreal? No big deal, just really curious."
2,Dude movie,"I've seen the movie by my English teacher. I liked and disliked it. Some people were good, some were not that good. I think that Judge Reinhold (as Brad Halminton) is the best character. He made me laugh so much. In the movie, he is a very good brother. Stacey Halminton (Jenneifer Jason Leigh) is an irresponsible girl. She got pregnant with a stranger (stupid enough). Compared to today's life, 1982 was a ""dude"" life. It seems to be funny and also dangerous. People has sex with everybody, get pregnant. Do they care about VD? Sure, AIDS haven't existed yet, but still... That was the thing I hate about the movie. But I can say that it was a good movie. It reflects well the reality of that year. I would recommand this movie to all people who's 15 and up. If you're not yet, wait untill you're at least 15. (Some scenes may not concern you.) And if you don't like sex (or too young) stay home and rent a comedy."
2,Too 80s,Too 80s.Was funny when I was that age.But not so much now.My memory was funnier than was in the film.
3,Not so Great Video for a Blu-Ray,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video (which is 1.85:1, I believe, because it filled my widescreen LCD), is not so great. There is a lot of fine grain, and the background seemed to move at times. The image is not real clear, or detailed. I give it a 7.0 on a 10.0 scale, and I have never given a Blu-Ray's video less than 4.0.The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was adequate, but not great. Although I didn't notice any sound coming from the surround speakers or sub-woofers, I did notice sound coming from the fronts and center speakers.I thought sure Judge Reinhold's boss at the pirate restaurant was Chris Elliot (it looked like him, and sounded like him), but Chris was not in the credits, nor could I verify this using Wikepedia."
4,80's hit,"If you were growing up the 80's, you will love this movie. This is not necessarily a family movie. There is one scene that has to do with Judege Nielson stimulating himself (not graphic) while fantasizing about Phoebe Cates who happened to be over at the house swimming. Jennifer Jason Leigh is nude in one scene."
3,Is there a different version?????,"Ok every one loves Sean Penn as the stoner surfer who constantly annoys professor Hand. If I had a professor like that I would try to have a pizza delivered in class!!! What I don't get is I saw this movie on TBS a couple of years ago and there were scenes on that showing that were not on the DVD. What gives?!? I am wondering if I should buy the new special edition of the movie or if it will be the same version I have just with extras. Overall I would recomend this movie because it is a true riot!!! You have to love the scene where Phoebe Cates comes out of the pool....topless. If you want to relive your high school experience with a little more ""Mary Jane"" this is the movie to watch."
3,Fast Times,I dont really dont have anything to say about this movie I got this movie for my parents. But they enjoy it very much.
1,Dull,"What a waste of celluloid. The jokes aren't funny. The film tries desperately hard to be funny (like the masterbatorial fantasy), then throws a supposed 'serious' situation (the abortion). It fails in both regards. The characters are flat and lifeless, except Ray Walston's Mr. Hand, and Sean Penn's Spicoli, but these characters are so overblown, they seem hokey. The film is a foul piece of garbage."
4,jennifer jason leigh,"this is a movie of nastalgia( i hope i spelled it wright) and to the one's who have seen the movie know what i mean by my one linner on the top. to the fans of the 80's movies its a must to add to your callection. im not saying its the only reason to see the movie it's far from it. this movie also has an actor who whould later ""ROCK"" the house.(if u know what i mean) the scene im refering too is cut out of the network versions. although there is no real plot, it is a comedy that will have u rolling on the floor, cring in some parts.:)"
2,Before they were famous,"Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinholdt, PHoebe Cates, Forest Whitacker, even Nicolas Cage play in this movie before they were famous. Sean Penn is the funniest because he plays a stoner 'dude', the guy I would want to kick in high school for being really stupid.The movie is not really funny, and not really good. Fun seeing all those famous people, but it's also stupid."
1,Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I had always heard what a great movie it was. Unfortunately, that was not my experience."
1,"Crass, Crude, and (hopefully) unrealistic","This is a bad movie. Lousy plot, lousy situations, lots of sexual talk, and lots of gutter scenes. Basically, there are two reasons this movie became famous:1. Sean Penn's portrayal of lovable burnout Jeff Spicoli is dead-on funny at times.2. Phoebe Cates shows her pineapples for a few seconds.That's about it. Not a very commendable way to make a movie."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"Gee, I'm sorry to all the thirty-year-olds who like this horrible movie because it reminds them of their youth, but this movie is one of the worst I (and a whole bunch of other people I know) have seen. It's boring, gross (and not in a funny way)and embaressing to watch b/c obviously, that's what some people think teenagers act like- dumb, boring and stupid stupid stupid... especially Jennifer Jason Leigh. She's supposed to be the ""average"" teenager, which means she has a pea for a brain and has sex with people she doesn't know and gets pregnant. Don't waste your money! Go buy the Breakfast Club or Better Off Dead instead."
4,Major Trendsetter for all teen movies to come.,"Being a fan of rough-around-the-edges movies such as ""Dazed And Confused"" I had to see this. In fact I BOUGHT it without even seeing it before. At first I thought it wasnt even funny and that it went no where. Considering it was made in the early 80's I knew it wouldn't be as bold as the shock comedies of today such as ""American Pie"". After watching it a few more times I began quoting scenes such as ""No shoes, no shirt, NO DICE! "" . And soon after that it was in regular circulation in my VCR and I was reccomending it to all my friends. So if your a fan of 80's movies or teen movies period, than ""Fast Times At Ridgemont"" high is the movie for you."
2,DVD is missing Scenes?????,"I was very disappointed to find out that the DVD is missing several scenes that were included on the TV versions (seen on TNT and TBS for examples).1. Exenteded Scene in the burger joint where Spicolli disucess with his friends finnally meeting Mick Jagger , ""This PICK..."".2. Alternate scene in the mens room where Spicolli discusses doing too many drugs and how it will effect him.3. Extended Dialogue between Stacey and Ratner on the field trip.4. Extended love scene between Stacey and Dimone, full Nudity.Why leave these scenes out. The movie seems incomplete? THis is a classic, but the dvd should contain all scenes. Seems like the producers of this DVD, didnt want to spend extra money and redit this film. Lazy."
5,"""hey bud! what's your problem?""","this is such a good movie, you won't want to miss it. it's a hilarious movie, and you should see it."
4,One of the seminal teen films of the 80's,"With teen romps like American Pie and so on and so forth, there are a handful of films to which they owe themselves to. Fast Times at Ridgemont High is one of them, and is notable for the fact alone that it helped launch the careers of many future stars and even Oscar winners. The story follows a group of various teen types; most notably being Jennifer Jason Leigh as a shy, would-be vixen and Sean Penn as the class stoner. Watching the film nowadays sees that it really hasn't aged all that well, but it's still enjoyable thanks mainly to Cameron Crowe's scathing screenplay and Clueless director Amy Heckerling's (in her directorial debut) energetic direction. Also featuring Phoebe Cates, Judge Reinhold, Robert Romanus, and Brian Backer in larger roles, but be on the lookout for small roles and brief appearances from Nicolas Cage, Forest Whitaker, Eric Stoltz, and Anthony Edwards as well."
3,Poor soundtrack and sync problem.,"This is the only DVD I've seen in a long time in which the voices are frequently out of sync with the actors' lips. Plus, this flick has a lot of great 80's songs that remind me of going to high school in California, but the DVD's soundtrack is regrettably only mono."
4,Holds Up Phenomenally!,"I haven't seen this uncut I guess since the mid 80s and was surprised how well it holds up. There's not a dull moment and it's extremely well-staged and directed by Amy Heckerling (Clueless, Look Who's Talking). And it's incredible the cast they assembled, including Sean Penn in what is one of the classic comedic performances of all time. The DVD itself looks pretty good, although I believe the sound is mono. Extra features include a 40+ minute documentary which goes on too long but is worth seeing because it shows a lot of the cast members as they look today."
4,Early 80's Classic,"Fast times at Ridgemont High is a one of those beloved 80's comedies that just about everyone can enjoy. Though the movie is geared more towards an older teen to mid 20s crowd, people older should be able to get a kick out of this movie and relive their youth. What I like about the movie is that even some of the heavy issues do not seem to drag the movie into a drama too much. Basically there are a bunch of small stories about some high school kids that are all tied together to give you a look at the life of kids this age.This movie is definitely rated R, so it might not be the best to watch this with parents/children. Other than that, it is like watching a time capsule that is sure to produce a lot of laughs and a pretty good time."
4,"The movie is a hoot, the disc has a lot to offer.","A lot has been said about the film- it's often funny and has some memorable lines. About the disc- the video is great, clean and anamorphic. The audio is a bit disappointing, but as the film was recorded in mono that's what you've got to work with. Dubbing in new versions of the songs would be distracting and probably expensive (licensing).... The commentary is a hoot. Heckerling and Crowe both praise and diss the cast (Heckerling says Jennifer Jason Leigh was ""happy as a clam to to take her clothes off."") They both worship Sean Penn. Heckerling often sounds amazed that the movie even got made and is quite self-effacing."
4,"A fun, at times thoughtful, movie.","Don't come here looking for an aesthetic experience, but do come here for the fun. This movie has some decent acting and pretty good directing. Its storyline gets a little jumpy trying to cover one year's time in the lives of about six characters, but not so much that you can't follow it. There are a few moments of actual thoughtfullness (such as Stacey's disturbing first sexual experience, or Rat's pining for a girl who's not as innocent as she seems), but overall this is a movie you watch for fun, not enlightenment."
3,An interesting read...,"Interesting to read about the breed from the Cuban perspective. The history of the breed, however, seems to be skewed by a lack of free information exchange in Cuba...it doesn't quite mesh with the history as presented in other countries...but, it was an interesting book and worth reading."
2,Mega Disappointment,"My own fault for not recognizing this book is only 32pgs long. With that, this is nowhere near the comprehensive history of motorcycles that I had hoped it was. Compounded with the fact the book is out of print and I paid $14.45 for a flimsy picture book with a $6.95 cover price. Buyer beware."
1,"""The big double bed was empty, as empty as my soul."" (pg 339)","I just finished reading this book, and dear god is it terrible. In 355 pages there are 12 deaths. 12! That's an average of 1 death every 30 pages. There is a mysterious gang of Druids, a drug deal gone awry, stolen nuclear waste, a plot to blow up an air force base, and the mob. There's also Bob- poor dead Bob- who, as the protagonist puts it, is ""a good kid, gay or not"" (pg 344). Additionally, women in this novel are only mentioned in relation to their sexual relationships with men. Although the setting of the novel is a coed college (Hamilton College) and the protagonist does much of his detecting by talking with students and professors at the school, he never once encounters a female student or a female professor. This book provides excellent material for my senior thesis, which is about men's colleges and men at Hamilton College in particular, but I don't think the novel is worth reading for any other reason."
3,Ok to watch,"This film was alright, It had descent acting, I wouldn't buy the film but if someone gave it to me i'd take it. This one of those films you have to see for yourself."
2,It should have been better,"I had heard about this film for several years, and was quite looking forward to seeing it. After all, just to be able to gawk at Dean Cain is worth the price of admission. However, this film made so many wrong turns that it was left unsalvagable. The writing is amateurish, and every character is a cliche. At one point, the guys are even sitting around a table complaining that ""they should make a movie about guys like us!""It is a shame, because a lot of money and a lot of talent went into the making of this film, and it offers us absolutely nothing new. No one talks like this in real life, and every issue that they grapple with is done so on such a hypothetical level as not to be believed..."
2,Too much.,Too witty. Too whimsical. Too white. Too West Coast.A stereotypical gay movie about stereotypically gay men.Just imagine the girls on SEX AND THE CITY with penises and pecs.
3,mixed feelings,"I had my doubts about this movie even before I saw it, and I still have them. It's about a group of gay friends, all with their individual issues of coming-out, being or not being in a relationship, recreational drugs, donating sperm to your lesbian sister, etc. Somehow it is all just a bit too much, I think it would have been better to focus more on a specific storyline. I also didn't think it was romantic at all, although there are some funny moments. It's just a nice film to watch when you have nothing better to do (although even then I could name a few others you'd be better off watching instead)."
4,Pleasant movie,"I thought this movie was fun and cute. It's about a group of gay men, who experience different things, some that test their friendships, others that strengthen them. I'm at a loss for characters names but one character has commitment issues, another is dumped by a long time beau who cheated on him, one falls in love and falls into drugs, one is struggling with his sexuality and does eventually come out and is involved with two characters. Another character likes to sleep around and throw them away and gets a taste of his own medicine. One character's sister wants him to donate sperm to help create a child for her partner and herself. The men all play badly on a softball team. It's a cute movie with lots of laughs. My only complaint is, there was so much story tell but so little time, so as a result it seemed rushed in many areas. However it was a nice story about friendship and definately lots of laughs along the way."
3,Pleasant Diversion - Innocuous and Sometimes Amusing,"No doubt about it - ""Broken Hearts Club"" is a blood relative to ""Steel Magnolias"" complete with the wise Patriarch (Mahoney), the suffering pretty boy (Cain), the new kid in the neighborhood (Keegan), the bitchy crumudgeon (Porter), the punked druggie (Braff), and the one who brings them all together (Olyphant). In fact, the boys even compare themselves to the Steel Magnolias (and the Brat Pack from ""St Elmo's Fire"")a couple of times in the film. While most of the performances are forgettable (Porter and Braff do stand out) and the script falls into melodramatic stereotypes (the Druggie, the Player, the Star-Crossed Lovers), the overall result is amusing and sometimes hilarious. Watch for a cameo from Michael Bergin, the former boyfriend of Carolyn Bisette Kennedy who wrote a trashy book in 2004 detailing their sex life."
2,Its totally broken hearted.,"Too many casts, very poor screenplay. What do you expect?A romantic comedy of course which entitled The Broken Hearts Club.Don't watch this movie if you are living in a gay-friendly community because its too similar. Its much more enjoyable seeing the ""real thing"" than this movie. Overall, if you arecurious or a ""newbie"" then there is a character in the movie which might help you along. But if you are coming out then watch ""Beautiful Thing"" instead.Just rent don't buy, unless you really love Dean Cain."
2,Broken Hearts Club Is Just Broken,"I love gay mainstream films and purchased The Broken Hearts Club with great anticipation. To say that my enthusiasm was short lived would be an understatement! The characters are all so whiny,feeling sorry for themselves and chronic complainers that there is no one to root for during the whole 96 minute opus. While similar gay themed films like Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,Jeffrey,The Object Of My Affection and Trick had characters to cheer for (or hate),this film elicted neither sympathy for nor empathy with any of the characters they were all so unlikable. And you got the impression that though these were supposed to be friends.....they were anything but. The story was thin to say the least and continuity was sadly lacking. The best performance came from veteran actor John Mahoney and his scenes were too few to carry and save this film. Hopefully a sequel is not planned for The Broken Hearts Club!"
2,Very Disapointing,"While it is cute this movie does not break any new ground. In brief mix late ninties prime time television and Mart Crowley's ""The Boys in the Band"" and you'll have ""The Broken Hearts Club"". A myriad of neuroses and stereotypes that will leave you feeling, ""Why did I watch this???"" Check out ""Trick"". Far more realistic and sexy with just the right amount of camp."
3,Heart Warming Good Time,"What? A gay themed movie that doesn't focus on sex but actual characters? All right, I know there have been a few gay films out there worth the time of day, and ""The Broken Hearts Club"" is one of them. It is honest and beautiful. It lacks everything original, but in these films, that doesn't seem to matter. Sit back, relax and enjoy. Don't take it too seriously though, or you will be disappointed."
2,"The equivalent of a television ""movie of the week"" --","OK, so I haven't watched the DVD. However, I DID see the movie, and it was passable at best. These characters are superficial and half of the subplots could be scrubbed without dispensing of anything substantive. Other than that the characters are gay, there is no reason to watch this movie. Well, that's not ENTIRELY true -- there is Dean Cain, and he actually can act."
5,A wonderful movie,I watched this movie with some of my good friends. This movie was a heart felt good movie. I have seen a lot of gay movies and most of them end up being too fluffy or too depressing. But this one was great.The charactors were wonderful and I loved how they showed there realenships with each other and how each of them had there hang ups in life and how they got around them or figured them out. This is a wonderful movie and would recommend seeing it if you are not even gay or know anyone who is gay.
2,Felt The Void,"There I was prepared for an evening of cinematic viewing with my better half sitting next to me. All systems were go, sodas, popcorn, hard candy, silence in the house. The cast seemed great, the context hit the spot, and so we pressed the button: ""PLAY"" - - - quick quips, one liners, boom, boom, boom - then came the story. In a word 'weak'. The comparison to 'Steel Magnolias' isn't remotely possible in a sain world. One never sees a true bond, a complete character, or any of that glue that would hold this bunch together. Something went 'amiss'. Everyone one did his best with what he got to do, there just wasn't enough there. When it ended, I was left wanting all the story I never got. Bummer!"
3,Well it is a start,"If you are looking for a deep interpersonal movie that leaves you bereft of emotion, and drained...this is not it. It you need a laugh, and something that does not tax the brain...you got yourself a winner. While I enjoyed the movie it was at best a little cheesy. This really is a movie that a bunch of straight actors decided to make, so they could put it on their resume. There is no intimacy, but it is light hearted."
3,Thin and a bit disappointing (lightweight Queer as Folk),"I was really looking forward to seeing this moving. Based on the plot synopsis I was ready to like it. The film does have it's moments, some of them quite funny, but the film never really takes off. I found myself thinking over and over again, ""Why should I really care about these people?""The only thing that came to mind was that the whole formula of characters seemed all to much like Queer as Folk, but with far let character development.All in all, I was disappointed, not to mention a little bored."
2,Cliches EVERYWHERE,"How very disappointing. I had really looked forward to seeing this film, but unfortunately, I should have passed. The script is FULL of cliches (Judy Garland references, over-the-top queens, etc.) and some of the most trite and forced dialogue I've heard in quite some time. Although I realize that most cliches BECOME cliches because they're true, it was very disheartening to watch this film and see the same tired old stereotypes play out before me. Dean Cain isn't bad in his role, but the rest of the cast is sub-par. Timothy Olyphant, who showed so much promise in ""GO,"" is without question the weakest actor onscreen. I'm surprised the writer hasn't found a home at Showtime's ""Queer As Folk"" -- the writing is just about as amateurish as that wretched show. I'd give anything to see a film or TV series with REAL, honest, and fully realized gay characters. Sadly, this isn't it. :-("
3,"Typical Gay Movie, not bad though","This is your typical gay movie, or for that matter, typical movie. It was a light-hearted romantical comedy. It was nice. There were issues to deal with and all in the movie, but I guess I was just expecting something a little more involved and less obvious. Movies like that tend to lack interest for me. Oh well. It was a sweet movie."
4,good time watch,"this movie was just fun. there were so many characters in it, each with their own personality that it kept you interested. there was no attempt to hide anything taboo in the movie. i also liked the fact that there was not the typical aids sufferer often seen in these types of movies. there was sex in the movie but i do not feel that sex was its main objective. to me the main idea of the movie was to show that gay men and women are looking for love just like straight people. everyone has love to give and most are just looking for someone to give that love to. the movie portrayed all the same trials and tribulations that straight relationships go through and i think it was intrended. the filmmaker is making the distinction that gay love is not different from straight love, and that is the statement the movie makes. this movie is good for a nice night at home, and will bring a smile to your face."
5,Emergence of Hope: The Emergence of a New Talent,"This is Jeff Neugroschel's 1st book & 1st books sometimes tell on themselves. A new author may not yet understand the editing process, may not yet have a grasp on the concept of tightening a story, etc. Jeff Neugroschel has none of those ""1st book blues."" This story is excellent -- holds reader attention, characters are well-fleshed-out (female voices are amazing for a male to have created & young person voices are on target), & the attention to detail in the surrounding world is on target --landmarks & items of the times put a date stamp on the story, even without the World Trade disaster as back-drop . . . all this comes together virtually seamlessly.My only negative -- It could've been longer. This is a short book & there was a LOT of room to get more involved w/these people. This is a feel-good story amazingly built around a horrific event in history.Jeff is a natural. Sometimes a writer is born a writer. Here we have one."
5,Makes You Proud to Be an American,"This book is such an enjoyable read and keeps you turning pages. Mr. Neugroschel touches the raw emotion of 9-11 and makes you proud to be an American. And, he teaches one to never underestimate womens' intuition! This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys determination, strength and gutsy drive in a character. This book has it all and will keep you cheering until the very end. Mr. Neugroschel, job well done!"
2,"Not Canon, and not as high a capacity","Despite the item name, this is not a Canon battery, but an aftermarket battery. I didn't purchase it because its 500 mAh capacity is a lot less than the original Canon battery which is marked at 790 mAh, so it won't last as long. Of course it is a LOT cheaper than a Canon battery, but you might want to find a higher-capacity one."
3,It has it's moments,"not the best but with some moments that are really funny... sometimes gets a little bit boring, but in general it's ok... very 90's.... if you like the kind of comedies made in those years this is for you"
4,Hecka Funny,This movie is sooooooo funny..Martin Short plays a little boy named Clifford who's parents drop him off to his uncle on their way to Hawaii cause all he thinks about is Dinosaur World and causes the plane to land in L.A. When uncle Martin breaks his promise to Clifford to take him to Dinosaur World thats win the fun begins...He makes a fool of his uncle in every way and the funny thing is he seems so innocent..Clifford will get to Dinosaur World by 'Any Means Neccassary'.
5,Martin Short's BEST!,"In my opinion; there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of Martin Short's humor with the exception of, ""Clifford"". My then teen children and I spilt our sides laughing at Short's work when we first saw this film! Several times we laughed so hard at a scene; we couldn't go on until we replayed the scene several times over. We were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter! All three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored. Even if you are not a big fan of Martin Short; you will enjoy, ""Clifford""!"
5,Clifford,The movie is hilarious. I could watch it daily. I received in quickly and am very satisfied.
2,Not Enough Laughs,"The major gags, which involve an airplane, tobasco sauce, lipstick, and a green dinosaur costume are underdeveloped and telegraphed too bluntly. Will Ferrell or even Adam Sandler would have been able bring more randomness to the setups. Charles Grodin as the foil is also far too stiff and monotone when compared with the performance he is ripping off: that of John Ritter in ""Problem Child"" which is infinitely funnier."
3,Buyer Beware,"I was so disappointed to receive a plain, flat wood style of the Black Pine Majesty Stand. I expected to receive the raised board design as pictured. I agree with Hardy85 whose review stated the same complaint and figured it to be a more recent version. I suggest you contact the seller before you make your purchase and ask about the product. The stand was packed well, however, the door hinges were loose and the floor base is uneven which causes it to wobble. Overall structure is workable (I can fix the problems), but the bottom line is always BUYER BEWARE."
4,4 star review for plastic storage bags,"These bags are fine - they are perfect for at least 4 sweaters. The zipper closings work well. I recommend this product. However, the guage of the plastic is too thin, i would have preferred a sturdier plastic casing."
3,Not that big for Jumbo,"Did I get it completely wrong?I have bought suit bags similar to that but I could not help being surprized that Jumbo was not that large actually.Apart from that, the quality seems fair."
1,Ignoring the Evidence Doesn't Make It Go Away,"Why is the mass of UFO evidence from astronauts, generals, pilots and government officials, completely ignored? Ignoring the evidence does not make it go away.A silly book."
2,Extratesticles: Where are They?,"This author, like many who make claims about the future of the human race, is overly optimistic about what human civilization is capable of. The arguments in this book are terrible. No conclusions logically follow and you can barely find a sentence without some large assumption. I was hoping for some analysis of the question of whether extraterrestrials exist, but this book is just an analysis of the Fermi Paradox and speaks only about our galaxy which I found to be incredibly disappointing. This book is just a bunch of farfetched dreams of the avid science fiction fan."
5,Required Material,"I spent weeks methodically going through the MS press book and picked this up for review five days before the exam. What a shock! The MS book hadn't organized and clearly explained 80% of the material as well as Amit Kalani. The end-of-chapter questions and sample tests clearly pointed out my gaps as well as Microsoft's test question style, which raised my scores on practice tests by 25%. I have experience working with webapps/ADO.NET, but never would have passed the exam without this book."
2,"Not so hot, badly worded questions","This book tries to be an ""exam cram"" but ends up being a badly abridged version of the massive Training Guide (ISBN 0789728222). There are page-consuming examples that don't add much, and yet key facts are missing. These facts do surface in the Exam Prep Questions, which at least informs the reader that they need to go research that topic, but those points should appear in the text. Questions are often badly worded; their intent is only explained by reading the answers.The authors should consider a re-write. Cut useless examples. Include code snippets with the minimum required context instead of the full ""Create a new solution, add a page named blah, add these 5 controls..."" Tighten up the prose; make it clear and concise for easy review. Cut the fluff, not the facts."
1,Obsolete,I returned this book once I found out Microsoft is restructuring it's certifications and will be retiring this test.
4,Bom,"O produto é bom, é fácil de comprar, mas como a compra é internacional levou aproximadamente um ms para ser entregue. De qualquer forma valeu a pena."
2,Partly outdated,"The first edition of the book was published in 1987, and unfortunately this third edition published in 1998 contains parts that apparently have not been updated since the first edition. As a result parts of the book are interesting only from a historic point of view. Some parts of the book, for example those about rig and sail trim and about how a panel sail is constructed, are okay."
5,An excellent resource for teaching algebra to the very young,"There is growing awareness among mathematics educators that algebraic thinking can be taught to elementary school children. To support such an endeavor, it is imperative that teachers understand the algebraic foundations of arithmetic in a deeper way than by simply manipulating formal symbols. This book is an excellent resource for teachers to explore, aiding them in their quest to foster the natural, spontaneous expressions of genuine mathematical understanding often expressed by students prior to having canonical representations for their ideas. This inner psychological foundation for mathematical understanding can then be better guided toward formal expression, rather than by imposing formalisms, rules, and algorithms from without."
2,Superman cartoons disappointing in quality,"This is an inexpensive set but I would not recommend it if your interest is the Superman cartoons -- the picture & sound quality are both mediocre. Far better to buy the single disk ""Diamond Anniversary Edition"" from Image Entertainment -- *much* better transfers. The 3rd disk, with the three color Fleischer Popeyes, is not bad but may be available more cheaply from other sources if that's all you want."
1,do not buy this,"I can not express how disappointed I was by this collection. I read the other reviews and thought a complete superman series, a couple of classic popeyes and rudolph digitally restored what could be better. So my wife got this for me for Christmas. What a wastesound quality ----poorno play all optionthe worst crime is the quality of the picture-----POORA Fleischer brothers cartoon is a work of art and this looked like a bad copy of a copy. Washed out,dark,you miss the detail that made these cartoons classics and why they are so expense to make;I expect this from a street vendor next to the rolexx watches.I repeat do not buy this!!!wait for someone to do this right"
5,A superb book on critical thinking,"One wonders whether tee has read the book. _Critical Thinking_ by Robert H. Ennis is one of the best books on the subject, and the title faithfully reflects the content. Ennis is a highly respected expert in critical thinking and informal logic. If you are seriously interested in learning how to think and argue criticially, this is one the best books to buy."
2,Great Toy But Buyer Beware,"I got the original Learn Through Music for my 2 year old and she loved it. We got three cassettes!!! As she got a bit older, we wanted to add to her collection, so we purchased this cassette, as well as the Pooh, both of which are Learn Through Music Plus cassettes, BUT CLEARLY STATED THEY WOULD WORK IN EITHER THE ORIGINAL LEARN THROUGH MUSIC OR THE LEARN THROUGH MUSIC PLUS... this is just not the case! The Plus cassettes consistently skip panels and get stuck betwen panels. I thought it was the machine and actually bought a new one. Needless to say, it continued to happen.A great toy but not as described."
5,Best 16' Tape I've Ever Used,"I agree with the other review & comments. I'm a commercial paperhanger with over 20yrs in the trade. 16' is usually all I need, and the thinner 3/4"" tapes are not nearly as good, and usually end up breaking quickly.I found a few of these at the local Target about a year ago. I bought 2 of them, and then noticed that they don't stock them anymore. I'm glad to find them here on Amazon at a good price w/ free ship. I think I'll stock up on a couple more just in case they stop making them, or they become even harder to find."
1,i just dont get it.,"he sounds awful.as if hes in pain.i know for a fact after 1 second,i was in pain.poetry?!?!?!?!?consider who was listening to this poetry,high hippies.and people complain about ashley simpleson!!!!!!!!!!!!!im sure its too late but im willing to ante up for a vocal cords transplant and have him redo all of this crap.you hippies must have had some good stuff!"
1,"Dylan, the worst singer imagined","What dribble. The guy cant sing, never could, and as far as Im concerned, was never a ""master"" of poetry. What dull music."
2,Do Not Buy This Album,"Dylan has at least 10 albums that are better than this. You've heard all these songs on the radio anyway, but what you hear on the radio is far from his best stuff. Here, in no particular order, are the 10 I would buy before this, even if the songs here were not available elsewhere:Bringing It All Back HomeHighway 61 RevisitedBlood On The TracksBlonde On BlondeThe Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3InfidelsOh MercyTime Out of MindLove and SleepThe Genuine Basement Tapes (which you won't find on Amazon)Greatest Hits Vol. 2 (MUCH better compilation)Okay, that's 11, but I couldn't help myself. This should get you started. Even better, go see him in concert."
2,erp,I love bob Greatest Hits is a different matter Listening to this cd you have no idea of what the man is capable of Talk about out of context Before i picked up the many times groovier greatest hits 2 i really didnt have a clue Avoid this one
3,enough dylan for my tastes,"no, not all of the best songs are on here you idiots; you need volume 2 also. or just get all the albums. I am not a big fan of these songs anyway, I really enjoy stuff like Desire and Blood on the Tracks. If you want to know why nerdy, annoying people who piss most people off quote Dylan at every opportunity, you should get this cd. THen you can become an annoying bob dylan fanatic too! how wonderful!fame has gone to mr Dylans head, making him think he can solve all the world's problems. we don't need more Dylan's, we need more workers and real thinkers.peace out"
1,this is swolen,bob dyoan's greatest hits??? this guy don't have hits. That song about the tambouines that's a Captain Kirk song. and the ones with babe in them were stolen from sonny and cher. how come peeple thing this guys good when he dont got no original stuff to sing for us. no one shoud buy any of his regords becuz it only let s him get awayy with what he did here. hell do more and take away from sonny.
5,Still the greatest place to start,"Size isn't everything, particularly not length, and although Bob Dylan's ""Greatest Hits"" clocks in at just under 40 minutes, it remains a great introduction to early Dylan.The song selection is excellent, alternating between acoustic folk song and band-backed material, and including most of the best-known tunes from his first seven albums, as well as the brilliant non-LP single ""Positively Fourth Street"".Other compilations have come since, but ""Greatest Hits"" paired with the double-disc version of ""Greatest Hits 2"" from 1971 is still the best possible introduction to Bob Dylan at his 60s and early 70s peak."
5,A good start,"Bob Dylan recorded so many classic songs in the 1960s that trying to pick out a single disc's worth as being definitive is a fool's errand at best. Fortunately, ""Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits"" was follwed by a double disc ""Volume 2"" that together make for two incredibly strong anthology albums. This album does contain perhaps the most well known songs of Dylan's incredible output from the 60's, though songs like ""Mr. Tamborine Man"" (The Byrds) and ""It Ain't Me Babe"" (The Turtles) were chart hits for other artists. The epic ""Like a Rolling Stone"" was the biggest chart hit for Dylan himeslf, while ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""The Times They are a-Changing"" came to define the protest generation. ""Positively 4th Street"" is one of the most biting putdowns ever recorded while on ""I Want You"" and ""Just Like a Woman"" Bob proved he can write great romantic songs as well.Overall, this is a great disc to start your Dylan collection and will ultimately leave you wanting more."
3,Only the tip of the iceberg,"For an artist of Bob Dylan's stature, greatest hits packages just don't cut the mustard. This overview of Dylan's early 60s work is completely inadequate as a complete representation of his Bobness' work. Every album the guy did during this period was brilliant from beginning to end. Any serious Dylan fan will yearn to hear ""Tombstone Blues"" after ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" or ""Girl From the North Country"" after ""Blowin' in the Wind."" Forget this disc, stop being a cheapskate, and shell out the money for as many Dylan records from the 60s as you can afford. Then consume his 70s work, maybe half his 80s records, and soak in his renaissance in the 90s. If you insist on buying this, just know you're seriously missing out on the rest of the best body of work rock n roll has ever produced."
2,"Typical of the ""industry"".","This, and all Dylan compilations so far, are just a cash-in by the record companies. I don't recommend compilations as they more noteworthy for what they leave out than what they include. Not always the case with all artists but definately so with Dylan. If ""they"" are truely interested in his music, worthy as it is, re-release all of the work. This one is like looking at one kind of apple and one kind of grape and concluding that this is what fruit is. I only give it credit for including the tidbits that it does."
3,"Great hits, not greatest","CD okay. Like BOB? Get ""No Direction Home"" double disc. It is great. Young Bob Dylan that is not yet commercilaized."
3,Good but Too short,"Greatest Hits does an excellent job of summarizing Dylan's best-known songs from his first seven albums. At just ten songs, it's a little brief, and the song selection may be a little predictable, but that's actually not a bad thing, since this provides a nice sampler for the curious and casual listener, as it boasts standards from ""Blowin' in the Wind"" to ""Like a Rolling Stone."" And, for collectors, the brilliant non-LP single ""Positively Fourth Street"" was added, which provided reason enough for anybody that already owned the original records to pick this up. This has since been supplanted by more exhaustive collections, but as a sampler of Dylan at his absolute peak, this is first-rate."
4,One man. One stage. A million things to say.,"I like this CD because of the image that comes with Dylan's words: is there a platform in his words, or is he really just writing good lyrics and those lyrics are reaching out to people who want to find answers to life? I prefer to think the latter, because a swirl of change in his life was still to come, eventually altering him physically and spiritually. But at the time, his style could not be tampered with. I especially enjoyed ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", because of the unorthodox style and art of his use of the lyrics.You can almost see remnants of modern-day artists such as Beck in a song like this. This is Dylan at his earliest, and, I believe, his finest."
4,not bad,"This is a good and overall very solid album, but among Dylan's early songs I would have chosen many different ones to call his greatest. Not surprising I guess, since it depends so much on individual taste when deciding what is the best in music. Anyway, I do recommend this CD for Dylan fans old and new, but don't overlook the great songs from his early career that didn't make it onto this disc. The ""Bob Dylan"" album and ""Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" in particular are packed with great songs (if you like the acoustic stuff that is), and are worth checking out."
5,The definition of Dylan!,"This cd defines Dylan; the poet, the objector to the war, the activist, the musician. The songs on this album are those which first got me interested to Dylan. Anyone who wants to understand Dylan's music in the 60's needs this CD."
3,translation in cultural perspective,Prof Carol Clark and Prof Robert Sykes in their 40-page introduction put the English translation of Baudelaire in a cultural perspective. Excellent example of translation studies.
2,C+ for coherency....,"The Night Class wasn't what I was hoping for. It won the Bram Stoker award, and I was in Ireland at the time, and trying to read anything even remotely connected to Stoker...However, I have to say I was pretty disappointed by this book. I had a very hard time getting into the story, and even as I ploughed along, I continually would get lost or distracted by the authors style and the plot. The story involves a student who finds out that a student was killed in his room, and there is something sinister occurring with the schools faculty because no one will admit she is dead. There isn't a great deal of the book that stands out in my mind as a plot line to discuss here, so I wont bother. I haven't read anything else by this author, and I suspect I never will unless there are very positive reviews. Maybe its just me, but I couldn't pass this particular night class.Relic113"
3,keeps your attention,"I really enjoyed this book, the only problem i had with it is that the ending leaves you hanging."
1,An achievement!,"This may be the worst book ever written; hopeless writing, pretentious, non-linear narrative, and no horror.I'm not picky about writing. I read lots of dreck. I'll muddle through awkward metaphors for the sake of a good plot, or a good scare. I'll also ignore sloppy plotting if the writing is good. I slogged all the way through this silly, silly book to discover that *it doesn't have an ending* it just sort of leaves things hanging like an art film.Horrifying, really."
1,confuzing,"This is confusing book, The horror writing need not be confusing. I know lots of horror writers who can give you scare by writing straight and to the point. When I saw 'Blair witch project' I was not scared but did get head ache from moving camera. But it was confusing, not scary."
5,Incredible macabre supernatural mystery,"Tom Piccirilli is one of the few current practitioners of truly atmospheric horror: horror fiction that takes place with a milieu so finely-honed it taps at the back of your neck like a chilly blade.In THE NIGHT CLASS, he tackles the tale of a young man who returns to his campus after winter vacation to discover a girl has been murdered in his bed. As he attempts to solve the crime, we learn that he suffers from stigmata, where his hands bleed whenever someone at the school dies. As his hands bleed more and more as he hunts the trail of killings across the university, he gains a greater education than he'd ever hoped for.It's a complex plot with some of the most offbeat and bizarre scenes I've read in years. A spooky, startling novel that will keep you glued to your seat until you finally finish the course."
1,Real world,"Save your money. This seems like it was written by a journalist assigned to the task. Also, does not address the realities of the ""Do not call list/law"". Read the science and art of building a life insurance clientele, by Al Granum."
4,Very Good Book,"I have used, to a degree of success, the suggestions within this book. You must follow and practice in order to become better. I recommend this book for an experienced producer or a entry level salesperson."
4,From the back of the book:,"Written for those interested in the study of the Bible, this modest collection of articles comments on some of the thought of each of the books of the Roman Catholic canon. The articles provide insight into major theological themes, offer literary information that will aid in reading biblical material, or explain some troublesome concepts. Besides serving as introductions to the biblical books, these articles are a resource to enhance biblical study."
3,Alright light,"It is a big and bright light that turns on easily with a rubberized switch. In addition to solid on, there are two flashing patterns. The battery life is amazingly long when you stick with the flashing modes.However, when you do have to change the battery, you'll be removing some screws to open the cover. If you ride on salty roads, you'll also discover that the hardware isn't stainless. The screws on mine became pretty rusty over one winter."
5,Awesome and Easy,"The Blackburn Mars 2.0 Flasher light is really cool. It was easy to install and when riding it is easy to reach the ON button while riding. This light is great if you want to optimize your safety while riding and the three flash modes makes it unique. My favorite flash mode is the third, which has random lights blinking. It is a fun and safe product for your bike. I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
4,Bright! Super,I love this flasher. Super bright and it has yellow led the front as well making you more visible at night. The variation in light mode is awesome make you very different from other FLASHER. Also has clip if you need to use it for a late night running. Great product.
2,Design Flaw,"This is a good light except that the back plastic cover, which is held on with screws, cracks very easily. The first light I bought I had to return to the store immediately because of cracks right out of the box. Now, 2 weeks later, I can see that cracks are appearing on the replacement they gave me."
4,Enjoyable Louie continues to entertain...,"For those who are Louie fans, this entry in the series is entertaining and fun. It's a mix of a mystery, a soap opera, and imaginative fun for all. Especially, Midnight Louie's um - experience and new found awareness. The book offers a little of everything - not unlike the city of it's setting. A little fantasy, reality and good natured fun! It's a coaster ride till the end. You really never know what next, but at the end when the loose ends are tied up, the good news is there is another story to come..."
1,Horrible.,"Schiller is promulgating his own take on communication theory (missing ingredient, he claims, a focus on labour) and is debunking the ""popular"" alternatives - Foucault, Althusser, Baudrillard, to different degrees and at various levels of intensity/vituperativeness. But, boy, he really blows it - both because (1) he's a one-trick pony and horribly literally minded and (2) he just can't write. It's horrible having to wade through his smugness and narcissism - the clever-clever tone, the tortuous syntax, the certainty. This is simply a very badly expressed piece of work and Schiller so impossible to warm to as a writer that if there is any credit to his argument, I simply couldn't bring myself to find it. Pass this over."
5,Very underrated single to ride to.,"I have owned this single since it came out in '95 when I was a senior in high school. Even though this is a single, the ""ghetto luv"" version is just flat out dope w/BWF-an underground group that we never heard from again after this track. The group was a female duo group that had some promise but not in the mainstream arena and was a rare one-hit wonder in the mid-90's when everyone that came out had more than just one song that was release, shut this group did not come out with an album. This song will always be a hit to this day and don't forget about this song and just roll on me baby!!"
2,Not the real Carey Bell.,"As a sideman, Carey Bell has enlightened hundreds of blues records with his amazing harp playing. As a leader, he has recorded several gorgeous blues - most of them for Alligator, especially onLiving Chicago Blues 1. And as an entertainer, Carey Bell would always give high energy performances, and catch each and every listener.But, on this CD/DVD, he COULDN'T give his best, because he was just coming out of hospital : so what you see here is just an old and very sick man who needed to rest and was unable to sing and play, as he used to. Even though he succeed to sing an emotional acoustic song in Lurrie's place, this DVD gives a wrong and sad picture of the man.Let's wait for other videos recorded when Carey was at his best, and forget this one."
3,A Little Squeaky,"Brake pads work fine, and fitted well, but are a little squeaky. I applied disc brake quiet, but still hearing the squeaks until the brakes warm up. I'm going to spend a little more on my next set of brake pads, but if you're in a pinch or don't mind a little noise they work fine."
1,Brake pads,I the product did not fit my vehicle. 2009 Nissan Maxima Two hours were wasted on uninstalling brake pads and rotors to discover that they were the wrong ones.
1,Overpriced short story,"$7.12 for a short story that took less than an hour to read, not worth the price as this was nothing special. If I had been told it was a short story and paid $2, I would have rated it higher.The book had potential with all the right ingredients, but it was a rushed effort to grab our $. This should have been a short story in a book with other stories of a similar nature, then perhaps it might have been worth the price. Don't waste your money. Again it is starting to look like Ellora's Cave is pushing to grab our $ without a care for providing a quality read that their loyal customers expect."
1,Tremors,"This story, excuse me, was just plain dumb. It really doesn't deserve my energy reviewing it, but just wanted others to know not to waste their time (or money) on this short story -for that is all it is - a short story with no merit - at a full book price."
5,another good mecha anime,"The first DVD of Zegapain is very good and the rest of the series lookes very promising. At first glance it looks like any other mecha anime, but once you delve beneath the surface you find a very interesting and unique plotline with many twists and turns. All-around in my opinion Zegapain is a great series."
5,Favorite boots ever!,"It took a long time for my goth phase to pass (23, after a promotion requiring a wardrobe overhaul). Trust that I have worn almost every alternative style boot out there, as well as boots in some form since I was 10. As the title suggests, these are the best of the best. Demonia always runs about a half size too large, but it works out fine because I use the tri-orthodic insoles they sell at the grocery store for extra comfort. PLATOON is well padded but wearing an additional insole gives you some arch support and preserves the sole longer. I wore these nearly every day for 4 years. Towards the end of the 2nd, the inside back of the heel started to wear, but it never went through. Nor did the actual heel ever separate from the boot itself, like some of Demonia's knee high platforms do. The toe is really exaggerated but not absurdly so. The traction is excellent.I recommend this over the RANGER which is too wide and poorly constructed."
4,informative,"The author presents viral research, the researchers, and the health industry in a manner that is informative and interesting for the reader. While the ending somewhat weak it is at least honest-no cure or conclusive proof has been established concerning HHV-6 - the author merely points the reader's interest towards the future.I have read the book twice and I appreciated the lack of hype both times. Sure, the medical cases were heart wrenching from any perspective but the author used the cases to support the story of the researchers cardigan and knox. These couragous individuals were shown among the others seeking to scientifically study diseases. Maybe regush will publish another book-or cardigan and knox."
5,Excellent product and seller,"This sign was a Christmas gift for our neighbor. I couldn't believe how fast the sign arrived. It's a well made sign, and I'd buy from this seller again in a heartbeat."
4,"Great set, but...","You'd think with the claim to comprehensiveness, they'd find a way to stick 'Hot Fun in the Summertime' and 'Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)' in there somewhere with all the other bonus tracks."
3,What???,Thank you Falletinme...is my favorite song by Sly and the family Stone...Hot Fun is my second...and Everybody is a Star is up there. To have them not on this collection...shame on you! If you ever get the chance to see the video of them performing it live (I think it was Ed Sullivan?) you should see it. Fabulous.
3,"This ""Collection"" is missing KEY tracks!","This set could easily have been five stars. A one-stop shop for all your Sly & the Family Stone needs. But for some reason, they decided to omit three songs:1 - Hot Fun in the Summertime2 - Everybody is a Star3 - Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)Really, they couldn't have added these to the end of ""Stand!""? And what really hurts is I found this out after paying 50 bucks and tax for it. There was no tracklist on the box itself, but I naturally assumed these would be included. I'm still shaking my head in disbelief."
2,My daughter gets her arm stuck in this chair!,"As a high chair goes... it's ok. I guess I have nothing to compare it to though. The wheels easily fall into the locked position (a little annoying) and food can easily fall under the seat, in to this practically unreachable crevice... but I can deal with these things.What I do not like about this high chair at all is that on one more than one occasion, my daughter has gotten her arm stuck in between the outside of the chair and elbow of where the legs of the chair come up and bend. If she leans over in the chair a certain way (and she's ALWAYS strapped in tight!) her arm can easily slip into this narrow spot. It's only happened a few times, and we can always get her arm out easily, but SHE can't get it out if she gets it stuck, which scares and upsets her, and it appears to hurt her as she tries to pull her arm out. This is a poor design for a high chair and I would not recommend it."
1,Should not have bought this high chair!,"I was very excited to be getting this high chair. In the store I thought it looked good, and the price was unbeatable. Then I got it home. Assembling the thing was pretty difficult, and I'm generally very good at doing that sort of thing. Once the high chair was assembled I was afraid to put my daughter in it. It doesn't look sturdy at all, and no matter how much I jiggled the seat back and tightened and readjusted the screws the seatback looked cockeyed. The reclining positions for the seat also seemed really unsafe- I was worried that my baby might lean back and have the seatback slip into a different position.I am returning this high chair to the store today and will be picking up a better one. I was hoping to save some money with this high chair, but my baby's safety is worth the extra $40!"
1,Spend a little extra and get a real high chair!,"This is the worst high chair money can buy! It is not at all sturdy, the tray easily comes off. The seat cushion is not firm enough to keep food from going underneath. It also has some very hard to clean nooks. The wheel are constently falling into the locked position. When we first looked at this I thought we were getting all the features of the more expensive high chair for less. Wrong. Go for a more sturdy model for your child's safety and your sanity!"
2,Not the best investment,This highchair is not the best one that I ever had. I would rather have a old style highchair then this one. It is not sturdy at all and it always looks crooked. I will be returing this and getting a more sturdy model.
1,Envision hi chail model#2891466A,"This is absolutely the worst hi chair made , my 18 mo. great grand son has kicked the tray off more times than I can count.No hi chair needs a tray that slides on like this one does, he kicks the lever till he kicks the tray off, I have to be with in arms length while he is in the chair, I keep it at the lowest setting so he doesn't fall out.. I had to put one star because there was no 0. I was looking for recalls when I came across this page to write a review."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I have had so many problems with this chair and I will be spending even more money to replace it.1. Once you wash the separate tray in the dishwasher it never fits back into the bigger tray; also the hole for the handle is the perfect place for my daughter to stuff food.2. The pad doesn't fit well and food constantly falls underneath. there are also holes and crevices in the seat that food gets into and is impossible to get out.3. The ""easy"" fold is a joke.4. It takes up way too much space; the base is too wide and when folded the seat makes it too akward to put away.5. The worst thing is that the reclining seat falls back all of the time and my daughter has figured out that she can push the tray off with her feet and send food flying.DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!!! It would be okay for grandma's house, but not as your primary chair."
2,Buy A Different High Chair!,"Although this high chair does get the job done, it is dangerous for babies! My 7 month old gets his arm caught in the side every time he sits in it, the bottom of the tray scrapes his legs, and it is so shaky it feels like it could break very easily."
2,"All was fine, then...","We actually had registered for this chair and received it. We had no problems with the chair until my son(at 9mos) figured out he could 'rock' in the chair. That's when we had problems with the seat unhooking on one side. We thought he was going to tip the whole thing over!! Needless to say, the travel boosterchair that we bought for going to Grandma's became the primary chair of choice to feed our son."
3,it's ok,"I got this because it was cheaper, but now I wish I wasn't so frugal. This chair serves its purpose, although it has its downfalls. The tray doesn't seem to safe, and it only has a three point harness. The three point harness is horrible, my son always slides to the side and hangs over the edge. I worry that he may tip it over. This chair is ok if you only use it once and a while, but not good for everyday use."
1,Not safe,"I just started using this high chair a month ago, and I am already having problems. As mentioned by many others, it is hard to get the tray on and the ""easy fold"" is not easy. I have tried many times to fold it but have never been able to do it. The worst thing is that the screws on one of the height adjusters have fallen out twice, and I can't screw them back in. The screws do not catch in the holes, so they are completely loose. I have emailed Evenflo about the problem, so I hope I can get this resolved."
1,Junk!,The adjustable seat back is never even and it takes a rocket scientist to get the tray on correctly. I wouldn't recommend this product.
1,this chair should be rated 0 stars,heck I wouldn't give this chair 1 star. I got this a few weeks ago for my son. I was very hesitant to get it and Its going back. I was getting ready to feed my son tonight and well when I put him in the chair even before strapping him in the whole chair fell straight down to the ground. I had to take my son to the hospital in fear that something was wrong. He is only 7 months old. This chair goes back tomorrow for the one I really wanted. A baby trend Laural.
1,Horrible high chair. Hope you do not buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I only wish I had read reviews before I purchased this high chair. I agree with the other reviews. The back is flimsy and the tray doesn't come anywhere close to the baby. I also called the company to complain about the design. They offered to upgrade to their more expensive simplicity chair, which features the same design flaws. Evenflo is way off base with this one. However, I must say the company resolved my complaint with a different product. Maybe if enough people complain they will take it off the market and go back to the drawing board."
2,Only okay for a second chair,"Since this chair is cheap, it's okay for occasional use at Grandma's house! But there are many problems.My nine month old son has chubby legs, but he isn't enormous. His legs get stuck under the tray of the chair.The one handed release is hard to use. It always takes two hands and really yanking it out.The tray is so close to the baby's legs I don't think this will be good for an older baby to use with the tray.The padding doesn't stay on.If this is your only chair, I would suggest spending a little extra and getting a baby trend. We love that chair--It has all the features of the Peg Perego or the Chicco and is half the price."
1,Dangerous!,My baby has also had her arm caught between the seat and legs of this high chair. I just got off the phone with the manufacturer and they offered to refund my money or send me a different seat (Simplicity). I hope this new seat is better otherwise I'll be contacting them again. I also contacted the CPSC and reported this high chair.
1,The worst chair,"I bought this chair without thinking to check reviews on it. I must say this is the cheapest piece of crap ever. Everything that Jennifer wrote is true. The first time I put my baby in this chair I had blue sticky stuff all over my hand. For the life of me I couldn't figure out where it came from. Later I realized that is was the painted emblem on the tray. What if that was toxic and my baby got it in his mouth!!!!!I hated the seat positioning because it doesn't lock into place. Also, it is supposed to be ""Easy Fold"" That is far from the truth.I really thought I was stuck with this chair because I had thrown the reciept and box away. However I took it back to Babies R Us and no questions asked they exchanged it. I paid $40 more and got the Fisher - Price Aquarium chair. and I love it. Well worth the money. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this chair....."
3,It gets the job done,"I just got this highchair and I like it. Putting it together took some time and it seemed a little unstable at first, but once I tightened some of the screws it turned out fine.I like the color and feel of the seat cover. It is easy to wipe clean. The tray is easy to use with one hand. I like that. My daughter is very comfortable in the chair at mealtime.Overall I'm pleased with this purchase. I was not expecting a $50 highchair to be the same quality as one that is $150."
2,Food goes where it doesn't belong,"Although the adjustable height and reclining features seem nice, in reality I have used them only once or twice. The main problem with this high chair is that the food goes everywhere but the tray. The tray doesn't go in far enough (despite having ""4 positions""), so there is a large gap between baby and tray where food goes. Food also goes between the cloth pad and the plastic chair, all over the buckle, on the main tray (instead of the removeable tray), etc. It's sometimes nice to have a removeable tray, but when food gets all over the main tray, there's no point.Buy a simpler high chair with less ""features"" you will never use."
1,The worst high chair EVER,"I wish I'd read the other reviews here before buying this chair. They are all accurate. We picked this chair because the features sounded nice and the price was good. Now we hate the chair and will be getting another one to replace it. My 15 month old learned quickly how to push the tray off the high chair, which makes mealtimes a nightmare. The chair is also very hard to clean. We haven't had problems with the seat reclining suddenly, just the tray flying off when you least expect it. I emailed Evenflo with my thoughts on the chair and got no response. Don't buy this high chair...go with something sturdier and easier to clean!"
2,Agrees wholefully!,Wow....I've had this high chair for many months and have had the same issues as everyone else. My only problem is that I did not know that they were issues until now. So I guess that all high chairs are not this difficult. Thanks for the enlightment everyone. Also I too was only looking at the price tiag. There was no way I could afford a pricier one because I have twins so everything is x2. $100 dollars sounded a lot better than $180. I plan on having more kids soon. So I think I will sale these and go for the pricier ones next time.
4,Not as bad as everyone seems to say!,"I chose this highchair for two reasons- the reclining seat, and the fact that it changes height vertically. I'm five-two, my husband is six-three, so we feed our daughter on very different levels! I have not experienced any of the problems that other reviewers seem to have. My daughter has fallen asleep in this chair many times, and she has never kicked the tray off. I also called Evenflo and got a second cover, so we can have one in the wash and one on the chair. I could do without some of the nooks and cranies under the seat, but that isn't a big enough deal for me to get upset over. My daughter loves this chair- she often stays in it long after dinner is done, just to get the ""grown-up level"" view of the world. It's simple, it was inexpensive, and it gets the job done."
4,"Excellent Liner Notes, But Poor Sound Quality","This three-cd set has excellent liner notes, giving us a detailed account of Willie McTell's life, but the sound quality on the JSP McTell box set is far superior to what we get from Document Records. I recommend the JSP box set, as it is cheaper, has equally satisfying liner notes, and also features McTell's Library of Congress songs which he recorded for Lomax. There is nothing bad about this set, though. If you can find it at a really cheap price, go for it! However, Document Records' discs are usually not cheap!"
1,Buyer beware: it's not who you think it is.,"Jeez...the GALL. I, too, was hoodwinked into getting this book, thinking it was by the famous and familiar writer, Fran Lebowitz. I read the blurb on the back and the description of the protagonist's life was certainly not that of the more famous Fran but I was in a hurry and thought it might have been a comic novel, even though that's not been famous-Fran's genre. Two pages in and I knew I'd been baited-and-switched. Thank goodness I had found it in a remainder bin so it cost next to nothing, which is just about what it's worth. It's only mildly amusing and I find it reprehensible that its author would choose to write under that name, even if it's her own, in order to sell books to unwitting readers who would not have bought it in a million years otherwise. It's perfectly legal, of course, to use one's own name even if it's identical to that of someone much more famous and accomplished in the same field, but I wouldn't say it's exactly ethical, either."
1,close call,"Isn't being a female humourist who is also called Fran Lebowitz a little like opening a store selling burgers called McDonalds with a logo that is a big golden M? Luckily I stumbled across this in a second-hand store, leafed through, thought, ""Christ, Fran Lebowitz has really lost it"", and never bought it. The fact that Fran Lebowitz HAS lost it is purely coincidental."
1,disaapointed that its not that Fran Lebowitz,"No insult intended to the author but I was very disappointed to order this book and find that it was not by the same author of the social satires ""Metropolitan Life"" and ""Social Studies"" but since there were no reviews I had no way to know.So wanted to post so others might not by it for the wrong reason as I did and be very disappointed. This is another writer named Fran Lebowitz."
1,Warning: This book is NOT written by THE social commentator Fran Lebowitz.....,"Not to take away from the writer of this book (which may be very good in her own right), but I do think it's sort of nervy to put out a comical social commentarty like book under the name of Fran Lebowitz and then expect people not to think they've been hoodwinked. I think the other Fan Lebowitz (Metropolitan Diary etc.) is well-known enough that she should get first dibs on using her pen name on a book without having to add ""Yes, I'm THAT Fran Lebowitz"" after her name. This would be like me writing a sci-fi book under the name Ray Bradbury (whether or not that's my real name) and then not expecting buyers of the book to be less than amused when they learn it's not from THAT Ray Bradbury....."
4,Another drink? Another story? Yep. Please.,"This is a kind of memoir - first person narrator. And it seems like it is going to be another mother trying to find herself with her kids thing - its not. Fran is a cynical, amusing and very self-aware New Yorker finding her high heeled feet in Singapore. There are many laugh aloud insights in here and its a great portrait of expat life. Good read."
5,THRILLING!!!,"The only thing I can compare Captain Nemo to is the Irish musical called ""Riverdance"". The story of Captain Nemo as he struggles to save his oceans, his soul and the love for his wife was a very important part of this story. Then, the Captain Nemo overture at the end gave this fine story a grand finale like the music in ""Riverdance"". I didn't want this story to end. Maggie."
5,A great adventure under the seas.,"It was a pleasure finding this novel. I read it over twice. My two sons who are in college also read Captain Nemo and were very impressed by Mr. Xavier Carbajal's style of writing. Scenes in Captain Nemo move along fast and then suddenly there are these magnificent descriptions of underwater worlds inhabited by whales, sharks and giant sea creatures that communicate with Nemo and his crew. I don't think this is supposed to be the Jules Verne Captain Nemo; but I know Mr. Verne would loved to have a copy of this novel."
5,Captain nemo is remarkable!,"Jules Verne would be proud of this magical sequel to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and Mysterious Island. I loved the way the author, Xavier Carbajal, went deeper into the mind and soul of the legendary genius who commands the seas. As I listened more and more, I was drawn further into the oceans and felt like I was one of Captain Nemo's crew. I also loved the music and the sound effects. Encore! Encore!"
5,Captain Nemo is the greatest thing ever!,"Usually I just like to read comic books along with my brothers and most of the X-Men, Spiderman, Spawn, or Blade stories do not create good, strong female role models but Captain Nemo was all that. Captain Nemo was not only a great story it also had special women like Captain Nemo's daughter Sonja who was one of the most important crew members of the Nautilus. Also Sherry Lynn who was running the gallery on Marco Island. I guess you'd have to see Marco Island and the Everglades to visualize this story of a scientist trying to save his oceans. My brothers and I also thought the music was cool-it made this audiobook sound like it was a movie. We also think this would make a cool movie, if its done right. My brothers and friends at school would go see it."
5,On it's way to a Classic,"Considering the amount of true scientific research afforded this novel, I am impressed how entertaining the plot is. A very amazing twist on good verses evil, verses an even greater evil. The prose regarding the ocean topographics and the communication with the sea creatures was good form. But this can't be Jules Vernes Captain Nemo? The characteristics are all different. A true warrior with insight and style. This Captain Nemo will become a treat for generations to come."
4,Gifted From The Source Of Love,"Seal is definitely one of those artists that really does seem to find a way to come in and out of the industry, but never loses any of his classic feel for good, quality music. He proved it very, very well at songs like Kiss From A Rose, and Prayer For The Dying. Yet, after the dissapointing Human Beings, he came back with Seal IV, and hit it again with Love's Divine. The song is one of the most boldest and elegantly created songs that he has ever recorded. It is just a great ballad that has a unique touch. Yet, with so many artists that really don't seem to have a simple feel with music, Love's Divine by Seal is really one lovely song.Overall: B+"
2,How one man learned the art,This book was an autobiagraphical approach as to who one man learned. In this way the book was not what I anticipated. I thought thst I would be reading a book about techniques not how one internalized techniques. The below book was what I found more helpful. Kyudo: The Essence and Practice of Japanese Archery (Bushido--The Way of the Warrior).
4,Daimajin returns,"When I was growing up in Worcester, MA I used to watch The Creature Double Feature and see the best films including Frankenstein, Dracula, Gamera, Godzilla, and many others. For many years I've been searching for Daimajin, without knowing its name. I always remembered it in black and white.Seeing the first volume in color, and letterbox is a treat. Yes, it's a standard story of good vs. evil. Yes, the subtitles are not very sophicated. Even so, Daimajin ranks up there with the great monster films. It has its own style and flair."
1,Horrible,"This is the worst dvdbox i have bought. There picture quality is horrible, the picture is often full of blinking squares, it happens whenever small details with contrast show, i have never seen anything like it.The english credits interupts the movie with a grey background, the english credits are realy unnecessary and destroyes the feeling of the movies, the english credits should have been in the subtitle or at the very end of the movies.The writing style on the back of the dvdbox doesn't fit with the movies, it lokes like some emo writing or something.The movies themselves was also dissapointing, the movies begin with boring japanese acting where not much happens. The daimajin doesn't appear before the last 20-15 minutes of the films. There is about 1 hour of the 4 hours the trilogy lasts that are worth watching. It's obvious that Daimajin was made into a trilogy just for making more money.Maybe i had too big expectations after watching the awesome trailer for the trilogy?"
5,"An Amazing, Unforgettable Story","I read fantasy novels for my own entertainment. I do not concern myself with trifles. I simply want to read something fun. If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings, you probably will enjoy this. It was entertaining and that is my sole criteria in a fantasy novel.McKiernan is an extraordinary storyteller. I will be thinking about the ending for months. The villain, Baron Stoke, is the absolute best, worst villain I've ever encountered in movie or novel. He makes that evil, child-murdering British captain in the Patriot movie look like Richard Simmons.This is the first time I've felt strongly enough about a book to give it a review. It deserves the highest rating. Get in your most comfortable reading chair and enjoy Eye of the Hunter."
1,Not as good as I remember...,"When I was younger, I read the Iron Tower Trilogy, and remember it being a good jaunt, though a basic copy of Tolkien. In any case, who cares, if you like those types of stories.In this, the adventure itself is not bad, though does drag out after a while.The worst part is the preaching that others here have mentioned. I found myself just flipping pages to get by the ""Man is destroying the world, thourhg pollution, uncaring disregard"" stuff, as well as the ""Noah's Story is not logical"" speech...Good grief! It would have been much better without the soapbox, but for me, that killed an otherwise OK story. The first half of the book was good then, you end up getting more and more ""stories"" being told with political views...I would spend your money elsewhere."
1,I can't believe anyone would give this 5 stars.,"Not only is the plot stolen, this guy just doesn't know how to use language. The strained pretentiousness of the dialogue and the irritating misuse of what he barely gleaned of ""Olde English"" while reading the Cliffnotes to Beowulf, made me stop every 5 minutes and think, ""What am I doing reading this tripe?""I really don't know. Don't waste your time. If you're looking for classic fantasy, read Tolkien. If you want something slightly more modern -- though still given to purple prose -- check out George Martin. And if you want TRULY first-class modern fantasy, Philip Pullman's ""The Golden Compass"" should be first on your list. But don't bother with this."
4,Great Clarins Quality but not enough of it.,the smell of the clarions Roll on Deodorant was the initial reason why I bought it. It goes on great and keeps you dry all day long. I work in Music. and am on the job all day. The only downside is that the bottle is too small for the price. It's just a little less value than it should be. I would love a bigger version for the same price. as it is very expensive if you use it every day. it runs out within 21 days. not good for the price. but i love the smell.
2,OUCH! My little toe will never be the same!,"Even though I ordered a wide size of these, they killed my little toe. I've got a huge blister and was limping by the end of the day. I wouldn't buy them again. They look great, but hurt like crazy."
3,Sized wrong,"I've always loved trotters shoes and have several pairs. However, though these shoes were attractive they did not run true to size. They were both too narrow and too short. I did not feel comfortable trying another size because they were so wrong size wize. Every pair of Trotters shoes I have are the same size but these were way off. Makes me scared to try to order another pair on line"
5,Sugar Minott is great,"I have this album and let me tell you, Sugar Minott is one of the most smoothest reggae artists I have ever heard. If you like reggae, I highly reccommend picking up this album and any other Sugar Minott albums you find."
5,Great research,"This is a very throe research about weapons and armor in colonial America. The author looked deep into past records to find the information the book talks about. Instead of guess work he has specific accounts and lists of the types of armor and weapons used. A very good resource, the pictures were cool too!"
2,A load of junk,"I bought the Hawking card because it advertised a ""directional antenna"" that promised a 200% gain in signal strength. I'm on the road a lot and I use various wireless hotspots to connect. With my IBM Laptop (built in card) I could connect quite easily, however for my Dell Laptop I bought this card to connect wirelessly.. and could never connect. The directional antenna is just that.. but you need to aim it at the router with pinpoint accuracy to get a signal.. any deviation side to side and the signal drops. I used Netstumbler to test this card and you could watch the signal drop off as you moved the card around. Even from 10 feet away from my wireless router, I could never connect. I took it back to the store. Junk. Don't waste your time."
1,No difference,I did not notice any difference from the card that was already in my notebook and sent the HWC54D back. It disconnected and didn't let me move out of the kitchen. It installed easily; it just didn't work.
4,card works great for me,"I have a Dell Inspiron 4000 Laptop which I installed it on flawlessly, and I can also pick up most of the wireless networks in my area as I can with my 14Dbi external antenna I use with my orinoco classic gold 802.11b card. (which is the way to go) but I like the Hawkings HWC54D for local wireless hotspots etc. I would of gave it 5 stars except for it doesn't work with Netstumbler."
5,Hawking Wireless Does Boost Strenght,"I am pleased with the Hawking HWC54D. It installed easily. More important it did boost the signal strenth for my Lenovo laptop from 68% to 100%. I do notice faster browsing speeds. The real test will be in a KOA or two when camping and using Slingbox (I'll update when I know). I also built a profile in my IBM Access Connections Software with no problem. Just be careful to ensure it uses the Hawking adapter and not the built in wireless adapter (not too hard to figure out). So I give this one 5 stars for doing what it says it will do. You do have to be careful not to swipe your hand past the keyboard as you could hit the antenna part but this is just a caution, not a major impediment."
4,signal magnet,"I have used cisco aironet, d-link, hawking and Buffalo high power. I would rate them 1.Buffalo g- mimo 2.Hawking HWC 54D (close second) 3. Cisco Aironet 4. D-Link 651"
5,Great,"Every bit as good as I expected. Great for referencing, organized by subject, helps with Sunday talks. I would recommend"
5,The Ultimate Wood Block Book,"I am a woodworker and never thought there would be a book that could help me with making blocks. I was wrong, this is that book. This book gives plans on how to make blocks that can be used to make supension bridges, casles, etc. Blocks that even a young teen would get a kick out of using.It also gives recommendations on how many of each block to build.I helped a friend make blocks for his children and they came out great.One downside to this book is that it calls out pine to build the blocks however the blocks in the pictures are made of maple or birch.Another downside is that this book disappears. I lent my copy to someone and it didn't come back. I am looking for another copy."
2,Don't Buy,DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE!!!! IT has been falsely advertised. It does not hold 70 rds like it say but really holds only 30. It is the exact same magazine that comes with the High Power Steyr. I bought two of these thinking they were 70 rounds and got them today I feel completly ripped off.
5,Cheap Alternative,"Rather than get one real Tokyo Marui Mag fo $[...] you can get two-three of these. Does not jam as long as you lube/clean it occasionally and CAREFULLY clean it out. The spring can get screwed up in any airsoft magazine, that other guy just has no idea what he's doing. No where near as solid as a tokyo marui magazine but as long as you don't try to break it its fine."
5,Nice,Very nice. I got one with my aug and could not tell the difference between the factory and this mag. Very nice product.
1,this isnt what it seems,"I got this mag to replace my other one that broke, and I was really mad. Some of other people's may have held 70, but mine only held 21. My other one held at least 300. I went to Airsplat.com, and I saw a 330 capacity mag for the same gun, at $29.00. I couldnt find the capacity of the mag at this webcite, but on airsplat it was the second information dot. The gun is great but the mag only fired twice on semi, and none on full-auto, and I didn't have this problem ever before. It only fired twice out of about 13 shots, so I don't know how reliable this magazine really is."
1,toms review,DONT BUY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! piece of junk the first day i had it the spring inside the magezine got jammed so then i proceeded to take it out and fix it but as soon as i lifted the cover the spring bound up into a ball. DONT BUY ITS A PIECE OF JUNK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,peregrine review,i received this product in pristine condition. i found the story very entertaining with a believable plot and interesting characters.
1,Do NOT buy this DVD,"OK, I can respect low budget film making, but this is a waste of money. First, the sound is so horrible, and the accents so thick, that you cannot understand a single word they are saying. Second, there is no explanation of anything they are doing (the name has been changed--when I bought it last month, it said ""Capoeira for Beginners""--which sounds like it is instructional). Third, the picture/filming quality is annoying. There are no transitions, the picture just ""skips"" to the next move. The camera jumps around and makes illogical pans and close-ups. Fourth, this DVD is so short that even the content is not worth the money.So, no-budget recording + no content= a horrible viewing experience."
1,Watch a class instead,"First of all, the tangible items are low quality; the DVD was not professionally made, but burned and labeled, probably at someone's house. The case insert is grainy and printed on regular paper. Next, the camerawork and audio on the DVD are poor: zoomed in too close to see the full movement in a lot of cases, no transition, and no explanations. The content on the other hand is acceptable. The DVD basically shows a Capoeira class (stretching, warm-up with basic moves, and a roda), which was long enough for you to see some good play. Then it finishes with an ""advanced"" moves section that started with boxing (?!) and has no dialogue until the end. If you don't have Capoeira in your area and you don't mind overpriced burned media, go for it. But, if you happen to live in a city where Capoeira is taught, ask your local instructor to sit in on a class. Most likely, you'll be invited to join the first class for free. Either way you'll get a better introduction to Capoeira. Axe."
2,Theres better Capoeira DVD's...,"If a your capoeirista with a few years under your belt... I suggest your go find other Capoeira DVDs, for instance Grupo Axe Capoeira DVD is a lot better. The DVD is ok for beginners... but I'm happy that Capoeira has upgraded from VHS to DVD. Axe!"
1,Give me a break!,"I don't know which is worse: that I actually bought this low-quality, home-produced dvd, or that there are people marketing this and calling it Capoeira. While the decription of warm-ups and instruments are passable, the rodas and demonstrations are singular and violent. This is not the dvd you want if you are a real Capoeira enhusiast. It is basically a taped class; All the games shown are a very violent regional style, Angola is not even mentioned, and ""fighting techniques"" are wrestling and boxing techniques that have nothing to do with Capoeira. Their music isn't very good, either. I have studied Capoeira under credible instructors for a while, and I can tell you that if you want a dvd on Capoeira, a company that makes budget aerobics videos is not the way to go."
2,Not worth the money,"I guess if you never saw a capoeira class before, this would be OK to watch. The capoeira is uninspired and unexciting. And what's with the boxing and juijitsu stuff? The production value is nothing. Looks like someone trying to make a fast buck off capoeira name."
3,Donckels Belgian Truffles,I love Belgian chocolates. I was excited when I ordered Donckels Truffles after researching them. They were very good but left of a somewhat bitter taste and for the money would probably not order them again. They also melt on your fingers immediately when you pick them up to eat.I served them after a dinner party and my guests did enjoy them.
5,Collagen Patches,"This item has been discontinued. If you can find this item, it delivers excellent results. Friends I have given samples to love it. Unfortunately, you can't buy it anywhere. The order I attempted through Amazon resulted in a strange shipment of some other item with packets in the open boxes... not identifying the ingredients other than ""Vitamin C."" The patches sent were NOT the Collagen or Collagen/Retinol patches that I had been buying for years. Caveat Emptor! I sent the merchandise back right away, but I am still trying to receive acknowlegement of the return and a refund. First purchase on Amazon, about as bad as some blind dates!"
3,OK,"I've owned this for 4-5 months now. I've been challenged in getting the cadence and speed sensors to pick up and can't seem to figure it out. First of all, the cadence sensor has to be real close to the magnet on the crank, but they don't give you enough rubber padding to make this work, so I had to rig my own thing--then I lost the magnet on the crank and it hasn't worked for months. I suppose I could replace it, but it kind of ticks me off. Lately, the speed sensor is going in and out and I can't seem to figure out why. The magnet on the wheel is right next to the sensor, but it doesn't pick up and then when I'm riding, it will just start to work. Maybe it's the cold weather, because this wasn't a problem all summer. Anyway, this computer is OK, but I'll probably buy a different one next spring."
4,Works Great! Installation Instructions need some work though...,"I had to find clearer instructions from a competitors website, because the Blackburn instructions were just too vague.Once installed though, the 3.0 gives me (a novice/casual rider) everything I need. (Speed, Miles, Time...)"
5,Utterly Quotable...,"Saw this movie years ago & it is still as funny as ever. I would say it is right on par with ""Tommy Boy"" which to me is Farley's best movie & maybe one of the funniest movies ever. He still delivers in this one too. I quote this movie with people all the time. Great lines & Farley is the king of slapstick. Highly recommended for a night in at home with friends or family."
5,Beverly Hills Ninja,"I miss Chris Farley, funniest man ever to walk this planet. This movie and all the movies he did are awesome buy them up NOW!!!"
3,Never received item,"I'm sure the movie is great. Unfortunately, I never received the item from Amazon.com's seller. I will not make any other purchases from Amazon.com because they have a policy that limits claims to a maximum of only 5 per the life of your account."
3,"good movie, shame theres no bonus features","I rate this DVD down lower because it dosent contain any bonus features. The movie is one of Chris Farleys best. But the lack of NO bonus features brings my rating for it down. When are these people who put these DVD's together come to relise that a trailer is NOT a special feature? Trailers are a standard that should come with any, if every DVD... its such a shame they treat great movies so poorly, and all the crap ones come with 2 discs of bonus material... who ever makes these things needs to rethink there stratagy i thinkAnd my regoiun 4 version didnt even come with the production notes... no that it would have helped .... but the great Late Chris Farley should have a little more respect for his great movies he did in a short time, compared to the way this one has been treated."
3,OK,This movie is ok. I saw it when I was younger and thought it was hilarious. I watched it again recently and it wasn't nearly as funny as I remember it. Definitely for a younger crowd.
5,Funniest movie ever,Some of the scenes in this movie are some of the most bizarre and funniest you will ever see. Chris Farley was truly one of a kind. The best I've ever seen as far as physical comedy goes. This his best movie ever in my opinion.
1,DVD DID NOT WORK,I HAVE A FEELING THE DVD WAS PIRATED. IT WOULD NOT WORK ON ANY DVD PLAYERS THAT I OWN. NOT TOO HAPPY.
3,kind of a let down but I stll miss farley,"we all know that he was best in tommy boy and snl. This movie has its moments but over all it is pretty laking. It is essential for any real fan of his but for the caual fans,stick w/ snl and tommy boy (best movie!!!!!)"
1,A huge dissapointment,"I rented this film and watched it. Unless you are a huge Chris Farley fan, this is not the movie for you. I like Chris Farley a lot, but this is his worst film. The best part about it is that it's only 89 minutes. If you like funny violence, there are some scenes just for you. But if you're the 95 percent of the world that actually likes a good comedy, stay away."
1,Not funny,I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and thought it was poorly made.It's like the editors and special effects crew were to drunk to make anything look good. And the acting was so forced high school students could do a better job.
1,Worst of Chris Farley?,"I really enjoy Chris Farley in Saturday Night Live and in Tommy Boy, and I was hoping for that quality of comedy in this movie. This movie, though, shows me that he can't carry a movie on his own. This movie has an incredibly lame plot which is predictably boring. Normally Farley flipping and flopping around is funny, but in this movie, it is rather forced instead than his natural zanny stunts. Half way through this movie I asked my friend if we should stop watching... It's that bad! There are a few slightly funny moments in the movie, but they aren't worth the pain of sitting through the rest.Chris was a great comedian, but let's not fluff our reviews out of sympathy for the deceased."
1,Why not allow zero stars?,"Because this movie deserves it. It was so bad I popped it out of the VCR without finishing it, the ONLY time that's ever happened. Chris Farley as a ninja sounds like a sure fire hit, but Beverly Hills Ninja does nothing with this incredible premise. The funniest moment was when Farley ran into the back of a bus at top speed, and it became apparent after only a few moments that the only humor to be derived from this movie would be watching Farley hurt himself; it appeared as if he was intentionally slamming into various objects in order to destroy them, not because he was an awkward but gentle soul. This movie was spectacularly awful."
1,"Sad, Very Sad","No, it's not sad that Mr Farley died young, it's sad that there are people out there that think such junk is funny. I wonder what truly talented movie comedians would have done with some of the gags and setups here. In this film, it's supposed to be sufficiently hilarious in itself that an obese man doing ninja moves breaks a lot of objects and knocks over things. Not an inspired moment in the whole 90 minutes. I would be surprised if the script took more than a day to write. Ugh!"
5,Funniest movie ever made by a chubby comedian,"With Chris Rock and Chris Farley in a movie, it's gotta be an instant classic which this movie was. Buy it now!!"
3,poor farley,this was his last film and unfortunatly it is his worst. It has its moments but really falls short of tommy boy etc only for true fans of a hilarious man that is missed
2,"Boo, hoo, hoo!","the preview made it look so god, but when i saw it, i thought oh, my god! not Farley's best work, is wasn't even funny at all. an instant classic, give me a break. it was shameful for me to watch all 90 minutes of it in the movie theater. don't get me wrong there were about 2 or 3 three funny parts in it, and that's about it. chris rock was good, farley was okay, that guy, lui kang from mortal kombat, couldn't have done a worse job, yeah that's right, a WORSE job. i think this movie could have been a lot funnier and better. the story was also idiotic. some sort of chosen one will be washed up on the shore, and look ho they got. they should go back to the shore and see if the real chosen one is there. i went, i saw, i didn't like it."
1,Bioenergetics,"Arrived on time, but cover was detached and the first page was scrunched. Also, the book had a lot of writing in it. Very dissatisfied, since it was for my son."
3,"It's Little Feat, it's good, not great","The sound is off, sounds mono, and the mix is not as dynamic as most live Feat releases. Still, it'll do in a pinch, esp, as substitute for a missing Britney Spears CD..."
3,Okay but could be better,"When I bought this book I was hoping to get a collection of stories that are based on Halloween night. But it ends up that it was full of stories that could have been in any children's collection of ""scary"" tales. The stories themselves had nothing to do with Halloween. The book has an introduction that begins on Halloween where a group of kids are telling their tales of terror, which is all of the stories in the collection. Then there is a conclusion based on that same night. Although the stories themselves were okay, I really had hoped it would be a collection of stories for Halloween.I believe the book is interesting, but not what I had hoped for."
2,"Starts good, ends terrible","I liked the first part about the conspiracies and the illuminatie but then suddenly it changes to a religious book quoting and explaining bible text about ""the coming armargeddon..."" I thought to buy a book with lots of coverage on strange fenomena etc. It turned out to be a ""bibletalk"" of yet another fanatic person who thinks that turning yourself in to the Elohim will save you from the dark forces. Thanks but no thanks! I will save myself in avoiding future books from this author."
1,Hilarious! Takes fantasy / comedy to a new level!,"This book is a real hoot! Unlike most fantasy / comedy, this one actually pretends to be a factual account of the ""evil conspiracies"" afoot in the world today.Stan's ""how to build your own flying saucer"", and ""where Einstein went wrong with relativity"", will have you rolling in the aisles.One minor suggestion - it should display a more prominent warning that it actually *IS* fantasy / comdedy - otherwise some poor naive, paranoid souls who read it might mistake it for reality."
4,Maybe the most perspicaious book on the underworld goverment,"I have ever read. Loaded with facts, backed by sources, articles and associates you could contact or read yourself to support the authors integrity. I read an earlier book from this same author, and this book reads like a sequal to it. More detailed, but with an overwhelming subject matter. If you like keeping your head burried in the sand, don't read this book. It is only for the people who want to know just what is going on right under their noses.... Keep writing Stan..... Looking forward to another update."
3,Important work on anti-gravity and Tesla,"Important work on anti-gravity and Tesla, October 20, 1998Reviewer: A reader from Stockton, CA The author's name is actually spelled ""Deyo"" not ""Devo"". I believe Deyo may be the first to reveal the connection between Tesla's antigravity research and what are known popularly as flying saucers. He could not get his book published in the US for years, despite it being a bestseller in Australia!"

I believe Deyo may be the first to reveal the connection between Tesla's antigravity research and what are known popularly as flying saucers.

3,widely-varying topics build the author's theory of humankind,"This book broadly covers many topics from ufo engineering to history and theology to a conspiracy theory. The ""cosmic conspiracy"" is the author's theory for the meaning of the existence of humankind. If you are a thoughtful intellectual but not yet a Christian, this book could help to finally take you there by assembling an epic thesis for your consideration."
1,Another version of this movie to avoid,"What is it with the studios and China 9, Liberty 37? The original R-rated version was a must see for Jenny Agutter fans. However, all DVD versions (this one included) have the great Jenny scenes completely edited out. If it's Jenny you want to see, my suggestion is to spend your funds on Equus or Walkabout. Maybe one day the studios will get the message that viewers want the unedited/uncut version of this movie."
2,Maybe the Film Was Better,"Warning: This DVD appears to have been transferred directly from a low quality film print, and the scenes have been editted and cut (for what purpose, I have no idea). Otherwise, it's worth a look for a fine performance from the always reliable Warren Oats."
2,Avoid This Movie!!,"This movie is advertised as being uncut, but this is not true. The Jenny Agutter scenes are edited by zooming in on the scene which does not shorten the length of the movie. I've seen this movie on Encore Westerns and it is shown without it being edited. Don't waste your money buying this movie."
1,china 9 liberty 37,"I had expected the oridgeal version and i received the cut virsion 2 i mean 2times i purchased to video's and had to pay for both. I would very much like my money back. I have purchased things from Amazon in the past and have been very satisfied, NOT THIS TIME. You said it was the oridginal and it was not. MONEY BACK PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as shown in picture,The scaler is not as it is shown in the picture. Its handle is difficult to hold.I gave three stars because it works alright.
1,Rather use a spoon,"No offense to the seller - this item was shipped super fast, and I have no complaint there. But as far as the item itself - I used it for one half of a trout, and then switched back to using a plain spoon, which worked better. The jagged teeth just didn't catch all of the scales, and I was afraid to press too much because I didn't want to cut the fish up. Yes, it is very cheap price-wise, but a spoon is even cheaper."
2,Silly,I was disappointed in this early series with Geoffrey Palmer. He is so wonderful in the series As Time Goes By but his demeanor in this series falls flat. The episodes are rather pointless and silly.
2,Butterflies,"I like Geoffrey Palmer in ""As time goes by"", but just couldn't get into this particular show...."
5,"""Butterflies"" is wonderful!",This DVD is very professionally made and is certain to bring back memories of the original tv show. The trials and tribulations of Rea and Ben are fantastic entertainment. It has been a wonderful experience for us to revisit old friends and to relive their experiences.
3,Editor desperately needed!,"Book should be titled ""Why I Love the Dominican Republic and Why You Should Spend a Lot of Cruising Time There... and BTW Here's How to Get There."" Edit his opinions and D.R. material to something reasonable, and you'd wind up with a good and useful book about 20 pages long."
3,Bea Arthur shines in middle-aged romantic comedy,"A sunny, funny comedy about love the second time around, MY FIRST LOVE is average Movie of the Week material, but it does star the incomparable Bea Arthur (""The Golden Girls""). Fans of Ms. Arthur will really enjoy this one.Widowed driving instructor Jean Miller (Bea Arthur) is pushed back into the dating scene after she decides to contact her old highschool boyfriend, Sam Morissey (Richard Kiley), now a retired doctor living in East Hampton. Jean and Sam's rekindled romance is hampered by Jean's meddling but well-meaning friends (Barbara Barrie and Anne Francis); plus the reappearance of Sam's sexy former girlfriend Claire (Joan Van Ark).While it doesn't break any new ground, the comic stylings of Bea Arthur and the perfect supporting cast ensure a breezy 93 minutes. The DVD from Direct Source Special Products is nicely-priced. (Single-sided, single-layer disc)."
3,"Heavy, a little too heavy","I love this watch as I do most Kenneth Cole watches, and I own a ton. But this watch weights a lot and looks extremely bulky. I guess I figured it would be big with the wide band, but this is too big for my 175lb frame. If you are a body builder or extremely fat, this watch is for you. If you are skinny or well toned, stay away from this watch."
1,One of the most boring books I've ever read.,"Having enjoyed Judith Gould's earlier novels I looked forward to ""Dreamboat"". I found it extremely slow and subplots went nowhere. The writer seems to have really gone off the boil."
1,Hilarious,"Carry active bombs to climb cliffs? Were these people out of their mind? No, because the makers thought explosions were required for an action movie, so they HAD to drop the bomb, and the avalanche HAD to happen. What's more, they wanted emotional moments, so the characters were encouraged to develop a habbit of cutting ropes. The whole plot was totally forced and predictable, filled with cliche. Besides, we have seen the same avalanche scen being sampled on so many films. Vertical Limit is plain boring, but the bomb thing is simply hilarious."
2,Absurdity Limit,"When you think a movie can't possibly get any more asinine, this one does. Amazingly bad script with totally ridiculous action scenes. What do you do when climbers are trapped on a mountain? You try to rescue them by carrying liquid nitro-glycerin up the mountain. And you take three different routes, including one which requires you to leap across a 30 foot span. And there's more idiocy - much, much more. On the positive side, the movie is quite funny (although unintentionally). The only reason I rate this film 2 stars instead of 1 is that the cinematography is actually quite good. The acting was not good, but no actor could have saved this script."
1,Someone needs to cut the rope on the filmmaker,"Where do I even begin? This is just an awful movie.Scott Glenn's performance is the only really redeeming quality of this movie. Although I have seen Chris O'Donnell do an amazing job in movies like Scent of A Woman, he obviously didn't have dialogue that he believed in, and delivered a so-so performance, (I am faulting the script, not him).This movie is just plain cheesy. Entirely unbelievable big action scenes make it seem like the filmmakers were just trying to see how many ridiculous situations and explosions they could fit into one movie. Oh, and if cutting the rope once wasn't enough for you, they do it twice in this movie. It is entirely evident that someone heard about the true rope-cutting story of Joe Simpson and Simon Yates inTouching the Voidand thought they could capitalize on it. Watch Touching The Void for a true tale of survival and adventure, and a beautiful example of how a well made movie can keep you on the edge of your seat."
4,A grate ride,I really enjoyed this movie I thought it had a lot of action it it. It was a edge of your seat thrill ride and I highly recommend that you rent this movie.
1,Director's Commentary explains it all,"When the Director reveals in the Director's Commentary that ""there's nothing as boring as watching somebody climb a mountain"" you know why the movie's a disaster. No wind on tents, climbers sprinting at 26,000 feet with no wheezing, no oxygen bottles, no goggles, grass at basecamp, --- A great opening but afterwards I couldn't stop watching this train wreck because it was so unrealistic."
1,"Should be called ""Unbelievably Fake Limit""","As a climber/hiker myself, most of these types of movies are just painful to watch. From the opening scene and the cutting of a dynamic rope with a pocket knife, should have known this one was going to make me want to throw my TV. But, alas I pressed on, hoping it would get better. Do the producers of this kind of crap not consult with anyone that has knowledge of ropecraft/climbing before making this junk? Don't waste your time."
4,Vertical Action,"This is a good mix of mountain climbing, action, and drama. If you like movies like Cliffhanger, K2, and Eiger Sanction you will probably enjoy it. It is easy to judge people as not caring until you have to decide to cut people loose to keep more from dying on the side of a mountain. Good cast, great scenery, and good music."
3,"worth buying, but try the auction sales first...","Yeah the storyline is hokey, yeah the whole Nitro bit is silly, but there is enough of a movie here that warrants watching, but don't buy it full price, save a few bucks and get it on auction, as I did. My only major complaint, there are too few scenes featuring Izabella Scorupco."
2,People get blowed up...blowed up real good!,"This film has its moments, though few. If any of you remember the yahoo film reviewers on the old SCTV comedy show, Big Bob McSomething and Billy Saul Hurrock, I think? They rated films highly based on the number of excrutiating explosions. Well those boys would have really liked Vertical Limit. And, yes, people do get blowed up, blowed up real good, with nitro.Not that it is a totally bad film. The scenery is beautiful, but then again it is the high Himaliyas. The characters are corny and caricatures of those EXTREME types you see all summer. You know, always running, biking, climbing, yada, yada, yada. Scott Glenn as the zen mountain man pondering savior of them all is almost comical. This all being said, Vertical Limit, will take up an evening if there is nothing else to do."
2,Not good,"The action scenes were fun- but other than that this movie is not worth seeing. The acting is corny and so is the plot. This movie isn't a comedy, but you'll be laughing at it anyway."
2,Another Average Action Film,"You can practically hear the plot devices creaking behind Vertical Limit, an action thriller about a team of mountain climbers who attempt to scale something known as ""K2."" It's a typical paint-by-number, but it's not as bad as some of its colleagues and it does zoom through its obligatory plot points with gusto, and a kind of freshness. At times, it's almost a parody of itself; it could almost be called innocent. Everything happens as it is supposed to, and it's kind of sweet, in a way that the familiar can sometimes be comforting."
1,how BAD is this film?!,"I have to agree with the majority of comments on here which say that this film is shockingly clichéd.Poor effects, obvious chroma-keying, laughable plot, etc. The opening sequence of this reminded me of the opening sequence of MI:2, except John Woo`s was real - and MI:2 wasn`t even a climbing movie! In that same opening section, there is the most blatantly fake ""eagle"" I have ever seen... feathers dangling of it, wings like planks of wood, etc.. I couldn`t stop laughing when I saw it, and I actually though this movie was going to be a spoof.......!Don`t buy it!"
2,The worst climbing movie I've ever seen,"I have some modest climbing experience. I took two schools of snow and ice techniques, climbed Mt. Rainier in WA and Cotopaxi in Ecuador. I read a lot about climbing. This movie is completely unrealistic. Who in the right mind would use nitro for crevasse rescue? I suppose they figured human drama is not enough and they need a lot of pirotechnics to keep people interested. How can you fly a chopper above 10,000 feet to rescue people off the face of the mounain? How can people not wear snow goggles and take off their gloves at those conditions? I reckon so that we can see the actors' pretty faces. I gave the movie 2 stars because some actors tried hard. If you want a better climbing movie see ""K2"". You will see real Pakistan, learn about pulmonary edema, the reality of flying helicopters at high altitude, the reality of mounting an expedition. Want a true drama see ""Everest""."
1,Could barely watch whole movie,"I hate to write a bad review, but I thought this movie was awful. I couldn't stand Bill Paxton's performance. And I love Chris O'Donnell, but he couldn't save this movie with his life. I literally could barely keep the movie turned on, but I decided to give it a shot and see if it got better. It didn't. The whole movie was very cheesey and I just couldn't believe the entire plot. It seemed as if everyone was over-acting or something."
2,Brain Candy,"A mildly entertaining film (usually only when someone dies, which the writers have found funny and creative ways of doing). The acting is less than spectacular, but not horrid. I really never cared for any of the characters, however, and only wanted to see them die in more humorous ways. The ending is overly predictable. If you want to give up 2 hours of your life and be mildly entertained for about 10 minutes of that, then see the movie. My verdict: Definately not worth going to the theatre and paying for it, nor buying it on DVD. Hell, I wouldn't rent it. However, I'd watch it if someone else rented it (which is what I did)."
4,suspenceful,"Just a good movie, enough suspence without gore! enjoyed the characters, could have shown more of the mess and confusion in base camp."
2,Don't waste your time,This movie is just not a good movie at all. There are a few scenes where it is not bad but the acting and plot are terrible. If you are looking for a climbing rescue type movie watch Touching the Void instead.
1,Waste of time,I have read several books about Everest including Into Thin Air. This movie gives you none of the sense of what mountain climbing is about. I had looked forward to the movie with great anticipation and was very disappointed. The special effects were an insult. It was like watching a cartoon. I expected to see Roger Rabbit pop up at any time. This movie tops Air Force One for bad fx.
2,pretty man!,"I'm not sure they got this film right. The heart throb guy is very pretty. The wealthy guy is evil. The sister is stupid and should have been left to die anyway. The scary man would like to find his wifey-popsicle. The Mountain was big but the air was a bit blowey, the snow was warm and inside the mountain it was very very cosy (they even had drugs 'n all!) The one thing I am sure that they got right was the American psyche that the way forward in saving stupid people's lives is to go in with high explosives and blow everything up. Who said life doesn't imitate art.I have got to say though that I really enjoyed this film. I watched it for free on tv but to make sure as little revenue gets back to the producers etc, I am going to boycot all the products that were advertised during its screening. BTW. The two stars are for the pretty guy playing being pretty very well."
1,Every Hollywood Cliche in the book,"I don't even want to give this movie 1 star. I just saw the movie and let me tell you, my eyes hurt from rolling them so many times! SO CLICHE! SO FAKEY! Not believable in the least. I didn't even bother to watch the last 5 minutes of the movie because I want to keep my food down. Don't waste your time even reading the summary on the box! If you see this movie at the video rental place, keep walking!"
1,Too violent and graphic for a pg-13 movie!,I let my 15 year old son watch this movie thinking that since it is a pg-13 movie my 15 year old should have no problem watching this. Well I was wrong! Occasionaly I would check on the movie to see how it was but I had no idea how graphicaly violent it was! My 15 year old will never watch it again! I thought it was a little strong on the reality side! I suggest anyone with children age 13 should view it before they do. I wish I had with my son. It really supprised me!
3,a review for a mountain,"I thought it was ok, because I was expecting a little less noise. I knew it was gonna be loud but ...! i dont think explosives belong on a mountain.... It was dumb to tell them to bring explosives on a mountain just to save 3 people."
3,If you liked Cliffhanger.....,This movie is in many ways like Cliffhanger but with not as much action as you might hope for. Still not to bad and worth a look.
2,Very stupid movie!,"I have to save my stupid sister because she was stupid enough to go up a mountain when she was warned not to. This is what Chris O'Donnell's character should have said in the movie, it would have been more entertaining! I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen in this movie and finally some stuff did. The helicopter scene and an avalanche scene are the reason for the two stars. If you like absolutely mindless action, there is not that much you would probably like this movie, this is a movie for you. The acting is horrible and the story is even worse. I saw this movie for $... and it was worth $...! After the movie was over I asked my two buddies what they thought and one said,"" It was the worst."" and the other said, ""It was all right"". I really can't see too many people writing too many good things about this one. I could go into the story and the characters, but if you read the first line of my review then you know everything you need to know."
2,Disgrace To Climbing,"I was quite excited to watch this movie at first, but after about 30 minutes, if that. I was disgusted. This movie lacks every aspect of real-life climbing. As a fellow mountaineer I found this movie to be a disgrace. Using explosives, too much dramma, a helicopter at 20,000 plus feet, and poor ridiculous mistakes clearly gives anyone who truely knows climbing a sense that the producers knew nothing of the sort. For example, when Chris O'Donnell jumps from one cliff to the other. That particular jump would have ripped his arms right off, nonetheless, running in crampons. Very poor, put together movie. This movie gives viewers a false image of what true climbing entails. ""Don't watch it/Don't waste your time."""
4,"High altitude tension, fear and adventure!","After Peter Garrett (Chris O'Donnell) watches his father die in a terrible climbing accident he swears never to climb again. That is untill his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and Elliot (Bill Paxton) become stranded on K2, the worlds most deadly peak. Peter assembles a six man team including Montgomery Wick (Scott Glen) for a rescue opperation.Of all the biggest climbing movies (Everest, Cliffhanger, etc.) this is the best of them. The opening scene gives you a taste of how tense the rest of this movie is going to be. These climbers seem to get in one hair-raising situation after the other. This movie has a great cast and a decent plot for this type of flick and serves up twist after twist. This movie is worth renting if you have not seen it.For a one disk special edition its loaded with features. It contains several featurettes, talent files and trailers. The DVD is presented in widescreen format and DD 5.1 surround."
2,Um...I don't think this movie was meant to be funny,"I enjoyed this movie tremendously. My friends and I were rolling on the floor laughing our heads off! However, since it was supposed to be a thriller, I think that maybe the director should be locked in a box and NOT allowed to make any more adventure films.The plot went something like this:Pretty boy Peter Garret has to lead a rescue mission to save his estranged sister and her team who have been trapped by an avalanche.The 'rescuers' plan to climb up the mountain where Peter's sister' team is trapped carrying Nitro they have obtained from the Pakistani military to blast them out of the ice cave they're stuck in. This involves jumping out of a moving helicopter with Nitro strapped to their legs and some how not getting blown up.If you want a good laugh, buy this movie. If you want a real adventure film, don't."
2,Mind numbingly bad - it must have been the cold.,"You can only use that ""Look out! Avalanche!"" ploy once in a movie. Unfortunately here it is used again and again and again. Usually leaving the one ""avalanched against"", hanging from an ice axe and blowing hard to indicate fright. Whenever the plot stalled, which was often, there was an explosion and another avalanche. This is a truly dire movie. And don't get me started on Scott Glenn......!!!!!"
1,It [was not good]! I hated Giving it 1 Star! Too Good For It!,"2 Words!Don't Bother!A predictable and boring film! The only saving thing at all is the beautiful cinema-photography!Other than that, you get villians who are stereotypical-evil guys!Your star who has self-doubts about a decision he made in the past and involved the death of someone he loved, (Can we say, Cliffhanger? A much better film actually.), and unbelievable (As in foolish!) stunts! The hero jumps off one side of a cliff, drops to the other with two ice axes in his fists and we are supposed to believe he can not only leap that far, but hang on to the axes while they somehow, dig into the sides of the stone cliff! Yeah, right!I have a problem with Hollywood films that ask us to suspend reality to that extent! I could have gone on, but you get the idea! Stay away!If you like this film, your mind is very small...."
4,"A Very Exciting Film with Great Audio, Video, and Extras","Besides being an excellent HT demo DVD, this is a very satisfying and exciting movie. If you have a fear of heights, this is great torture material as the shots are very powerful on the big screen! The EXTRAS on the DVD were perfect for this movie and we found the National Geographic Extra on K2 to be perfect after wacthing this movie with a bunch of other people. All around a very solid DVD and an exciting movie."
4,Nicholas Lea,Movie had lots of Action but needed more story behind each actor. Nicholas is way too good looking and talented to have had such a small part!
4,Edge of your seat action,"This movie was terrific. With its eye popping action and suspense it is a great movie all around. It was very touching and never had one of those boring ""get to the point"" parts. Very entertaining. A film that should be in everyones collection."
4,the movie was overall great...,"Vertical Limit definitely had its moments. Some goofs and bloopers were spotted, though. One that I noticed was when ***SPOILER WARNING*** Cyril slid down the ice slope, he had his pack of nitroglycerin on his pack. If the nitroglycerin goes off by movement, and Cyril was going down violently, why didn't the nitro explode? The movie is good, but don't be too critical of the bloopers. You'll hate it if you pinpoint every single error. The movie was overall great. Its special effects were amazing, the acting was good, and the action was awesome. I recommend this to anyone who loves adventure movies, like me."
4,I was entertained,"I found the movie entertaining if you like adventure and drama. I agree the acting had something to be desired, but when you use a real climber/mountaineer that actually has been on top of every major peak in the Nepal, is acting the prime concern? The movie will set most of the unknowing on the edge of their seats. Those of us who indulge in the reality of climbing and or mountaineering will question their every move made and every incident that happens. Take the movie for what it is, somebody elses idea on film and enjoy it. Lots of great scenery, and some good ""don't let this happen to you"" action."
2,At least the DVD had good sound...,"Pretty generic film. Predictable plot, predictable ending, not a particularly well written film at all - the only thing that kept me going was the fact that the DVD of this film had really good sound - I enjoyed the Dolby 5.1 mix, and the DVD really utilizes every channel well with crisp sound, whether it was the helicopters or falling ice and snow. If you can tolerate the myriad of cliches in the film and want to test your 5.1 setup, check it out. Otherwise skip it."
3,"Typical Hollywood fare, but a fun movie nonetheless.","Earth-shattering? No. But it's still a fun yarn to view on a Friday night with your friends over popcorn. If you've seen the hair-raising preview, then you know what I'm talking about. Boyish Chris O'Donnell as a nature photographer/hiker is a little hard to believe. But he and the other characters are simply accessories to the dazzling special effects. In short, 'Vertical Limit' is about the rush, the action, the climb up the mountain. Sure, it's no Schindler's List. But, in this case, who cares? I say take the plunge."
2,good for a laugh,"funny movie to watch with your friends. horrible horrible movie that takes itself WAAYYYYYYY to seriously. but again, some people find that kind of thing funny, as i do. (wait? the nitro reacts to the SUN?) (wait, the nitro is leaking out of those futuristic containers, again?) haha, not worth buying."
1,They just tried to out do Cliffhanger,"This movie is completely ridiculus. Cliffhanger is a much better movie. There are so many things that are completely wrong with this movie. They even make the Pakistani army look like [dummies] (and they are not). They should have done more with the scenary. I actually hated this movie...should have ended up on the cutting room floor! It has got to be the worst film ever made...Liquid Sky is a better film! Even to the point where they find this lost for ever frozen woman...just sick, stupid. I can't believe these actors did this film, a cartoon version would have been better. Even on ... this film would be the worst!!! The South Park movie is ten thousand times better! Don't waste your time, just grab some Warren Miller films and watch Cliffhanger..."
1,Terrible movie,"This was possibly the worst movie ever. Completely awful, unconvincing acting. Terrible, completely uncompelling storyline. Noone to like, and noone to hate in this movie. I was overcome by a complete apathy for everything about the movie."
2,A really big moutain and even bigger cliches,"If you combined ""Twister"" with ""K2"" or ""Cliffhanger""... wait those movies were pretty much formulaic in themselves. This movie accomplishes at least one thing: it's a derivative of derivative movies...This movie has very little going for it except the beauty of nature itself. Even the beautiful actors (well-cast for the most part) can't save it because the dialogue is so laughably bad.Plot twists? If anything unexpected does happen it simply doesn't make any sense. Continuity problems abound as well as some serious ethnic and religious stereo-typing.If you want a better movie that captures loyalty and survival in the mountains, rent or buy ""Alive"" -- it's actually based on a true story.If you want cliches filmed at 10,000 feet, watch this disappointing flick. Not awful, but not memorable either."
1,Worst I have ever seen.,"I foolishly turned on the TV in a motel last week and saw part of Vertical Limit. The totally improbable twists of plot invented soleley for the purpose of squeezing in another, and another, and another, and another, impossible cliffhanger suspense buildup, are an insult to real mountain climbers and ridiculous beyond imagination. The characterization is impossibly amateurish, the screen writing unbelievably ridiculous, and even the emotional tensions are so unrelated to reality, that I cannot understand how anyone could have spent good money to film this abortion...I really don't want to know. I am sure the ending is as meaningless and ridiculous as the rest of the movie."
2,How Do You Spell CRAP? V-E-R-T-I-C-A-L L-I-M-I-T,"I never thought that a movie about mountain climbing would be bad. Seriously. I never saw it coming.Actually, I did. All the really interesting parts, you know the ones where people are slidding and falling off of the mountain sides, are all shown during the trailer. If you were fortunate enough to see the trailer for this movie before it was released, you are saving yourself a grueling 2 hours. Because that's all this movie basically is. A test for wether or not Hollywood can make slidding of mountains look cool.I gave it a 2, because the action scenes were well done. (See above concerning trailers however.) The story was mediocre, and the acting and directing was hilarious. However, I'm sure that wasn't the intention."
2,Don't climb K2 without nitro glycerin,"The intensity of high altitude mountaineering is obviously not exciting enough for the Hollywood mentality, so the plot needed to be thickened. The streets of LA would have been a better scene for this plot, but I did enjoy the cinematography. The characters were also fairly interesting, and I might have enjoyed it more if I didn't understand the sport.Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet"
2,Cynically contrived plot,"This movie says it all about the inability of Hollywood to innovate and even more about the deep cynicism of the entire industry. We have the ususal evil billionaire. We have leaking nitroglycerine that reacts with sunlight; how the Pakistani's figured that out is a total mystery. The plot was so predictable, the characters so one-dimensional that the movie barely deserves the two stars. There are some good action scenes, true. But that is all worth seeing in this turkey. It is just the height of cynicism to see one of the richest industries in the world, which is run by some of the most vicious captalists in the world, continually casting rich people as inherently evil. If rich people are inherently evil than the evil people of this world would include all of Hollywood's stars, directors and producers. This point either passes them by, which makes them stupid, or they are simply the most cynical people in the world, profiting from self-degradation."
5,Vertical Limit,It's about a group of mountain climbers embarking on a journey. A member of the group is James Clesson and he is gay. After graduating from Cabrillo High his parents advice him to go to Los Angeles. There he meets some of his old friends and ex lover Andy Shipman. James is really egotistic and becomes the leader of the group. James and his friends embark on a journey called vertical limit. His friends abandon him because James' sexual tension intensifies. He gets on his lavish ford explorer and heads towards Colorado. That's all folks.
1,This is the absolute worst movie ever created,"This is the worst movie ever made, no wait it is the worst thing ever made. Satan himself would be ashamed of this movie. I had the misfortune to see this abomination and i was left wondering who was the target audience, cows?, pet rocks? mentally challenged goldfish? THe mountain climbing scenes in The Molemen where more convincing and had the abbed bonus of not featuring either Chris O'Donnell or Bill Paxton."
1,Bill Paxton and a judgement lapses.,"I will start off by saying i am ashamed to live in a dorm room with someone who owns Vertical Limit. On that note I could go on and on using vulgarities to belittle the movie. Instead I will do my best to explain to you what it is like to view Vertical Limit. Simply put it is like having three masked men jump you in the street, put you in a burlap bag and beat you with an iron baseball bat, again and again. And again. This movie is a slap in the face to rock climbers everywhere."
3,Funny - but not factual,"While this movie is entertaining for both climbers and non-climbers alike, it is so for different reasons.Climbers will find this movie hillarious (although a little irritating) with all it's factual inaccuracies. Even in the first scene of the movie it is obvious the director/writer has no climbing experience when the middle climber on a three person rope (roped up mountaineering style for rock climbing, no less) is belayed by his sister below him rather than his father who is anchored above him. And it just gets worse from there.Non-climbers will probably find this movie to be both interesting and exciting - but please note that real climbing is nothing like that (most climbers have more common sense than this and do not have a death wish). But as simply an action movie for the masses, Vertical Limit is an excting movie and nothing more."
4,"Great Color, Great Sound","The best of this BD is the color and the helicopter scene.Excellent definition for a few years film.The sound is great, with a lot of use of subwoofer and surround speakers.Recommended for action movie fans."
2,It's all wrong,"This was supposed to be a great action movie. The action scenes are great, I'll watch them again and again. It's the ""personal dramas"" that throw Vertical Limit into the trash. What could've been a nice action movie sank for its pretention of being more than this. Action movies should be about action, period. I thought the director had learned this on Goldeneye, one of the best Bond movies. The DVD looks great, sounds great, has valuable extras. The movie has nice action scenes but boring dramas and some weak acting. I found the action scenes worth it and don't regret it. Just wanted more of it."
1,Don't waste your time!!,"The only reason I gave this 1 star was for some excellent cinematography. The story is ridiculous, and any drama provided is based on a totally contrived disaster popping up every 3-5 minutes. Some good actors were wasted on the worst dialogue I've encountered in years. And need I mention that any resemblance between the climbing in this movie and actual climbing is wholly coincidental."
1,Awful!!!!!!!!!!!,"I almost feel sorry for those that liked this movie. I feel insulted that this was put in front of my eyeballs. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen I wish I could give it 1/4 of a star. It almost seemed like they were trying to make it a cult classic on purpose it was so bad. My wife and I laughed out loud through the entire thing, especially when it showed the peak and then the climbers walking near the top on a completely flat surface the size of 3 football fields. Also, hilarious was each climber carrying nitroglycern in their packs? This is a piece of Hollywood garbage that is a new standard in Hollywood crap. p.s if you want to see an actual climbing move ""The Northface"" or Nordwand is what you are looking for."
2,"Awful, but Nice To Look At.","Once again, a terrific trailer has been used to lure people into watching a horrible film. The opening climbing scenes in the desert - which look like they shot on a SOUNDSTAGE - ends with a hilarious cliffhanger. When Pops hits the ground, for one minute I couldn't stop laughing, it was SO badly timed. Later, Chris O'Donnell tries to make cute with Robin Tunney and it is painful to watch. I always love watching nature's splendor on the big screen but NOT in service to a shoddily written production such as this. Even ""Cliffhanger"" is better than this."
5,Classic Fun,"I think this is the classic version of the arcade original Dragon's Lair, Coin-Op Game. Awesome classic fun."
4,Great for Fencing!,"This glue is great for fencing (sport). It is by far the best glue for wiring blades. The only reason I don't like this glue (-1 star) is that it always seems to get on your fingers. But, it is easy and quick to remove with either actone or fingernail polish remover or some other solvent."
4,"Fresh, exuberant and endearing.","Readers who enjoy sampling early vintage “Golden Age” detective fiction are directed to Freeman Wills Crofts. He was master of what is known as the “time-tabling” investigation. If you also like to enjoy again the sort of adventures that appeal to young readers, you will find this one fits the bill. There are kidnappings, gangs of criminals, murder attempts, robberies, ciphers, and a treasure trove at the end of it all. There is plenty of action, on shore and off shore, some continental travel and there is the second appearance of Crofts’ sleuth, Inspector French of Scotland Yard, who takes over and concludes the investigation.Crofts’ later contributions to the detective fiction genre were of greater interest and aspired higher than this, but the book has a freshness and exuberance that are distinctly endearing."
5,best bang for the buck,"awsome picture, and super quiet. with lens shift setting up projector is a snap, sit back and enjoy. no need to spend top dollar this unit does it!"
2,Heavy Metal,"This got 2 stars because the pictures are so small that you could probably find better just googleing around. Honestly, it was a disappointment."
4,Worth it in Michigan,"100% improvement from the antenna supplied by Sirius. Easy to install and no longer have drop outs. One word of caution, be careful when you first install cable to antenna due to connector not being the best. Leave slack so that the cable does not pull free from threaded coupling when adjustments are made to antenna. Hooked it up and forgot about it and haven't had any problems yet."
1,"Poor qualtiy, small reception improvement","I have this antenna mounted on the roof of my third story. Reception is very slightly better than with the original antenna, but I don't know how much is attributable to the antenna as opposed to mounting it 2 stories higher. The quality of the antenna is poor at best. My first cable had a loose connector and overall the product is made out of lightweight plastic. I'd look at a competitors product next time."
2,"Not a big improvement, but still better than the antenna included","only slightly better than the antenna included. you need to have a CLEAR VIEW of the sky and roof access, both of which I dont have, to get perfcect reception"
4,Great product,"I found the unit to be very well built and well engineered. it was easy to install, and even before aiming properly was pulling in the signal perfectly.I would recommend this to anyone looking for an external antenna solution."
5,Terk antenna A-OK,"The terk antenna mounted on the roof of my home, helps the sirius sportster work perfectly, as advertised."
3,SIR-6 Exterior Sirius Antenna,"Purchased this antenna based upon recommendations including the 50' extension w/amp -- it never worked with the add'l 50' extension. When relocated to be within the 30' cable length the antenna cable connector end fell apart.. I called/emailed everyone trying to locate a replacement cable - no luck.. Ended up making a cable (RG-58 coax) and added SMA and SMB connectors.. Working fine with some intermittants, but expected since it's now located on the North side instead of the West as recommend...."
4,Improved Satellite Radio Reception,"This antenna definitely improved the signal for Sirius radio. We still get some ""dropouts"" around noon to 2 PM Pacific time, so we may still need to optimize the antenna position."
2,a slight improvement,"I live in a third story apartment, luckily facing east, but unfortunatly I have 2 problems: 1) I cannot install the antenna on the roof, and 2, there are three large trees outside my window. So, I'm still getting signal loss. it is better than the antenna included though.if you live in an area with a lot of trees, and you cant access your roof, dont bother getting satallite radio."
3,Middling performance,"This was a replacement for the indoor antenna that comes standard with most Sirius radios. From what I can tell, the better performance comes from a fatter cable to the radio but it does pull the signal in better, just not amazingly better. There are still drop outs and problems during storms, just less of them."
4,Good buy,"After purchasing this, I am now able to get a full signal from my radio. With the standard antenna, the signal was very intermittent."
1,Wish I could say the same,"Unfortunately I had problems getting my antenna to work and learned that Terk's support is VERY poor. The 800 number sends you to the Terk website, which is horribly confusing and doesn't even show the SIR6 on the site! What a disappointment."
4,terk reception,"It is a 100 times better than not having one, still will fade in and out sometimes but overall it is excellent."
5,Thumbs up for this one.,"I live in a dead zone and its hard to get Satelite radio without having the antenna in just the right spot in my house. I put this baby outside and now I get HOWARD STERN, The Rolling Stones Channel, and all of the other more than 100 great channels from Sirius loud and clear with out fade outs.This is a must in my little part of the world, if you want to listen uninterupted in any weather. These concrete and steel houses are great, but wireless can be a problem. Not with this out door antenna."
1,Rovos Rail DVD is defective,"This set of DVDs contains Rovos Rail, but it is defective and won't play in any of the players I've tried. I returned the first set and Amazon kindly sent me a replacement. It, too, will not even pull up the menu! I suspect that anyone who buys this set with Rovos Rail in it will find the same problem."
1,Worst academic treatment,"-If you don't know snakes and deformables at all, this book won't help you; if you already know, this book won't tell u more.-Fundamental math missing, like the enery minimization part.-No examples-Strange notation"
3,Passable software,Basically take Rand McNally Tripmaker and update the interface. I don't even think they updated the road database (c) says 2000 but I must admit the interface is easier to use so if you are looking for a simple city to city travel guide (place to place will only work if the place you are looking for is in one of the 83 full city guides they have in the program) that is easy to use then this is for you. If you want more map detail try Streets and Trips or Delorme Street Atlas.
1,Garbage,Shame on Rand McNally- This software is terrible. This reminds me of 1990 software. Just buy the hard copy Atlas. MapTech makes the best affordable mapping products available.
1,Wrong Choice,"VERY DISAPPOINTED. I was extremely happy and comfortable with my older (2002-?) version - but I lost it in a hard-drive scrub. (Bummer!) I thought this newer version would match and exceed it's ancestor - - DEFINITELY NOT! It's Clunky, maddeningly small (visually), has poorly defined controls, virtually no instructions or guidance of any value, and it's missing 70-80% of the features that made the old one so useful. Two main complaints: 1. It's too cursedly SMALL to see anything (clue: Not everyone has a 40"" flat screen folks.) and 2. You can no longer drag your given route to a new path like you could with the old version. (Or - the instructions for it are so arcane that it's impossible to find.) Lucky for us, however, their free online version DOES do most of what was not included in this version. I just found it a little too late. Oh well, learn from MY mistake people; don't waste your money on this - just use the free online version."
5,good stuff!,"I can't just wearing that to watching TV and expect to sweat much. however, I can really fell the sweat half way into my exercise session. I really do wish it can cover more of my waist area tho."
4,No waist size,It would have been good if the seller would mention the waist and hip size of this shorts. Also could not find the link for 'Ask seller a question' like before.
1,Check your details!,"Caution!!! The HP Pavilion a1220n DOES NOT come with Windows XP Media Center Edition as advertised. I had purchased this computer mostly to get the Media Center, boy was I surprised. Since it came from another supplier all I was told was that Amazon incorrectly advertised it. They could only refund my money (or let me exchange it for something more expensive of course).I wasn't willing as I had spent 2 hours on the phone with HP just to get the thing started. Turns out it was shipped without a cable connected to the motherboard.I've lost a little faith in Amazon here."
1,Not Media Not as advertised,"I had to send this back because it came with Windows XP Home Edition and not Microsoft Media Edition as advertised. I got a full refund, but also a disappointed husband as this was one of his Christmas presents!"
3,older game,i like these kind of games played alot of them. this ok to play its a place to start to get use to playing first person shooters
2,I am a big fan of the 47 Ronin but this stinks!,"Ok, this was made for a propaganda film during WWII. So The story was changed a little to inspire patriotism. But this a story about revenge and braking the law. And a little too much artistic license was taken. The shots are long and drawn out (although this was the norm back then) and the average shot length is 5-10 minutes. Unlike today which it is about 7 seconds. So you say you can deal with this to see the movie of one of the greatest stories ever written. And hope for some action too.Wrong. The grand last battle In which the ronin of Ako take revenge (and Kira's head) is completely cut. in it's place Mrs. Asano-Sama receives a letter the day after from oshi saying that they took revenge.I could not even finish this I was so put out.I implore you. Do not buy this. There are many other GOOD Samurai films!"
3,All talk; no action,"I found the film somewhat interesting as it examined the psychology of the participants, but calling it slow was an understatement. Since the film was commissioned by the Japanese army to instill patriotism, I had expected at least some action. In this I was totally disappointed."
3,J.M. Redmann's Death by the Riverside,"Good writing. The first in the Micky Knight series, so I gave it a little leeway. Slow start, but action scenes well-written. Characters same."
3,Smooth roads needed,"Active Tunes speakers work fine as long as the road isn't rough. When shaken, the battery lid cuts the connection in and out which is so annoying, I finally turn it off. If you mount it upside down, it works better, but still breaks down on longer bumpy roads."
2,Not as good as it should be,"Nice idea, but like others have said, unless you're traveling on very smooth roads, the vibration makes the sound cut off and on. Plus it's not loud enough when the ambient noise is higher. When you turn up the input volume, it overloads and cuts out completely. The vibrations broke the base of mine last weekend, so it's life is over. Still looking for better."
1,ITEM DID NOT WORK,The whole idea of this item was great but the sound was warbled and I returned it.
2,Good idea but poor quality holder broke immediately,"I got this for my wife to attach to our double jogging stroller. The sound quality is decent for a battery-powered set of speakers for the iPod. However, the plastic holder for the device broke immediately upon installation. I attached it to the stroller and tested the speakers and then folded up the stroller and the holder snapped immediately. Hardly any pressure on it. Really annoying!"
1,absolute---junk,"save your hard earned money, this item offers terrible sound quality and fortunately it is barely loud enough to hear....."
4,"a childhood favorite, rediscovered","I remember reading and enjoying this book when I was growing up, although I could not have told you anything about the short stories inside except that I liked Martin Pippin. Reading it again now as an adult was a delightful experience. Eleanor Farjeon was an old-fashioned romantic, clearly, but the woman also had some good insight into human nature. As Gillian (the romantic heroine) tells Martin at the end, ""...could you tell my friends so much they did not know and not know this?--girls do not weep for love, they weep for want of it."" This is an elegantly written book from an interesting and observant writer. Yes, it's a collection of fairytales, but they are not just surface entertainment, and the characters are intriguing. Martin is still my favorite."
4,Excellent Overview,"While the book provides an excellent background and a good assessment of likely options, it glossed over some considered politically unfeasible but which might be popular among the voters - for example, removing the cap on Social Security wages. It is clear the financial markets are dying to get their hands on the money. At the same time, most in the investment community don't want to create another board like CalPERS, which is active in corporate governance. Spinning out a portion to something like a defined contribution plan seems almost inevitable but is likely to result in higher administrative costs."
1,"disappointed, but taken care of","the paints in this were dry, but when i wrote the company, they reimbursed me. I wish they wouldn't have been, my niece was very excited about it."
3,healthy but not the most efficient,I bought this product for a more healthy approach to waxing so that my skin doesn't take in all the bad chemicals that are in those other commercial ones ... this one only problem I've seen with this one is that you have to keep it on for at least a good 20 min - to make sure it hardens enough- in order for you to be able to remove a good amount of hair.. If you don't mind the time then by all means
3,Alkaline Trio... Live,"This c.d. is in my opinion okay. This is the answer to the private eye single with two live songs matt sings, but now the live songs are dan's. The quality is still great, but the vocals are not great (dan seems to have trouble singing into the mic) the 1st installment of this c.d. contains the ""the metro"" and the ""private eye"" video. if you can find the 1st cd of this single go ahead and get that, passing this one up."
2,Technical details,"This book (5th edition) provided a few good, new tips and explainations, but my overall impression is one of incredibly technical detail on the practical aspects of equipment and processes. I feel like it's important enough to have a general understanding of ""how things work"" to stick with this book, but it does not give much advice on how to think about or approach photography. My eyes often glaze as they pass over how to read manufacturers' charts and graphs, how calculate focal length and color balance, etc., but if you're into that kind of information, you might be interested."
4,GREAT BOOK,"Great book, for all kind of experienced musicians, begginers or advanced. the only thing is that you should know every hand drum beat, such as slap, open an heel/tip tones.GREAT GROOVES IN IT!!!!"
2,Very Poor Coverage of Afro Cuban Rythms,"First, although there is a cursory presentation of 6/8 rhythmic exercises, there is no specific coverage of Guagancó, Rumba, Columbia, Songo, etc. This lack of attention to Eastern Cuban folklore (for example, in the Matanzas region) is troubling. There is not even coverage of the simple yet fundamental Cumbia pattern (yes, Cumbia is from Colombia, South America; however, merengue is from the Dominican Republic and not Cuba, yet it is included in this book and in most ""Afro Cuban"" topics), and the merengue section is merely two pages. The teaching quality of the material in this book is very poor also. If you want to really learn to play congas and Afro Cuban rhythms then get Tomás Cruz's Volume II - it doesn't have ""filler"" material on cooking and other trivia."
4,Quick and to the Point,this is the type of book that takes about an hour to read and is good to do so once a month as a refresher. Not only do you send better messages but you feel better about your communications.
1,Item Misrepresented!,"Since this was my first xm radio purchase, I'm a little green as to the correct antenna to buy. I ordered this because the picture showed a antenna, my fellow truck driver bought that was the right one, the antenna I recived does not look anything like this one, It's not the same! Also a customer review I read said it could be mounted two ways, mirror, or air dam. What I got was an antenna that ONLY mounts on the air dam (I needed the mirror mount type for now),and as I found out latter, was some old type technology, that requires two antenna (in) ports on your radio. My NEW skydock only axcepts one. Because I waited too long to exchange this, I am now stuck with a worthless piece of old technology. Have a Great day!.."
3,Only one problem,"My husband was pleased that I ordered him a new antenna for his XM radio. The radio comes with a very small, magnetic backed disc-shaped antenna that is designed to stick somewhere on the vehicle's dashboard. This leaves reception very dependant on direction and the position of the satellite for constant, uninterrupted service. We looked into various designs available and picked the Audiovox XM4 Truck Mount. He wanted to mount it behind the cab but high enough to get 360 degrees of coverage. Ooops....the only drawback......it does not come with enough length of cable to connect from the back of the cab all the way up to the dash behind the radio. Looks like we are back to riggiing it up on the side mirror mount outside the truck but that isn't the ideal spot."
4,This was my previous antenna,"I bought this model at a truck stop (Pilot) about 5 years ago. it was mounted on the left side front air deflector on a Freightliner century class truck. Worked fine for the 3.5 years i had it on the company truck. only 3 problems noted. 1- in heavy hi-powered AM/FM terrenstrial radio area, noted that signal strength would drop and in some cases disappear. 2-.Also, the ""universal"" mirror mount was not big enough to fit on the mirror posts of the century class truck onless longer mounting screws were used. (Hence the mounting on the air dam) And finally, 3- The mounting hardware corroded so badly that when I switched trucks, I was unable to dismount the antenna from the air dam.Overall, I was satisfied with the antenna's performance"
3,"I really like this, but it needs a small fix","I've used this basket once. The metal loop that holds the lid closed slipped off, and I dumped half my dinner into the grill and on the ground.I'm looking forward to using this several times a week. I can cut food into smaller pieces and toss them into the basket to cook, allowing them to cook faster and saving fuel (and making dinner happen faster!) But first I've got to figure out how to keep the top in place."
3,it's okay....,"The size is perfect, but the ""catch"" to keep it close is very loose, it keeps coming off. My husband used a binder clip to clip it together and it works well then."
4,The Clinical Manual of Chinese Herbal Patent Medicines: a Gu,"As a TCM librarian in one of the oldest US Universities, I find it is a welcome edition to the previous(2000) copy which is highly treasured. It appears the authors have made extensive revisions to keep the book current. It is an easy to follow book cleaverly indexed.By understanding the names and its composition is one thing, having the identifications for the over the counter products as shown in the back of the books will allow one to be able to recognize and use them. The downside is many of the drugs are contrabands and there needs to be awareness or a section devoted to the identifications of them, All in all, this is still an excellent Patent Medicine published outside of America ataffordable price.Sam Shueh, University librarianSamra University of TCMLos Angeles, CA"
1,Ironing board cover,I of course too did not read the reviews before I bought. Why they advertise this product as a pretty gold pattern and send a creamy plain one I have no idea! Needless to say they are getting mine back too. Very dissapointed.
1,PRIVACY,"CAUTION TO EVERYONE: Careful about giving Amazon or Target any personal information - like your name, friends, interests. They will publish all your personal information on the web and will not remove it when requested to do so."
5,Una voz de categoria,"I have been living in the U.S for sometime, but listening to Leonardo Favio reminds me of my childhood back in colombia. It takes me back to good times spent with my family and friends. If I was ever to have kids I will make sure they have a chance to listen to this brilliant voice."
5,Leonardo es la voz romantica de Latinoamerica,"Este CD es mas que excelente! Lo recibi el lunes y lo he estado escuchando sin parar por una semana. Inspira nostalgias, romance, amor, buenos sentimientos. Definitivamente Leonardo Fabio vivira para siempre en los corazones romanticos. La letra de su musica es inspiradora, su voz es acogedora. Este CD es una joya. Me pregunto donde estara hoy este inspirador de amor de adolescentes..."
4,The age of alliances,"In the past 10 years we have seen a tremendous amount of joint ventures, mergers and aquisitions and the future seems to be on the same keel. Strategic Alliances offers a framework to increase the opportunity for success as one ventures into new ground.If your desire is to one day be a CEO, president, divisional manager or you work on projects regularly, this is a great purchase and a great resource.Reading is a little dry and in some parts seems like a textbook."
4,Gives a good overview of alliances,"This book does a good job in introducing a systematic approach to various types of co-operations between organisations, an to develop a theory around the different forms of alliances.I found the text to be a bit academic and dry, and its' examples seem a bit outdated in many cases. However, case material related to strategic alliances can be found in the newspapers every day....."
3,Really needed an editor,"The recipes in this cookbook are nice, but there are LOTS of editing errors and timing problems that make using these recipes a chore. For example: the recipe for beef tongue in onion sauce. REALLY good dish but the time given to cook a large beef tongue is 20 minutes. It takes 3 hours to boil a beef tongue in Nebraska. I can't imagine it's that much easier in Brazil. Also, the ingredients lists 1 cup of corn oil for the sauce. Really?!? I'm betting it was supposed to be 1 cup broth from boiling the tongue. The written directions reference broth. An editor could have been great help.So use this book, but carefully."
2,Cho-pat knee strap,I found this product was good to begin with but as soon as I wore it a few times it became really loose & wouldn't hold in the correct position. I find myself having to adjust it every 15mins to ensure it stays tight. My previous straps have all held shape for a lot longer.
3,it helps but...,"Pros--this strap does help with knee pain caused by hiking too long downhill. I like the modest tan color. Con--the velcro section at the back of the knee is too wide and the corners dig into the tender skin behind my knee, especially when my knee is bent. It gets very uncomfortable very quickly."
4,Works for unstable knees,"Helps me do things that had become uncomforable or painful, especially requiring flexing my left knee. I wear it all the time when exercising now and it even has helped when I don't wear it. It does stretch over time especially when it gets wet but then stabilizes. Just don't get one that is near the end of the adjustment when new."
1,junk,Get the Nike knee strap. These suck. The huge area on the back of the knee has velcro sticking out that scratches. Bought two of these and both had this issue. These other reviews are a joke.
3,Good support,"Good support, but can't really review since the size I order was too small. I'll be back to let you know once I receive a new one. One more thing, I use it for running."
5,Works great!,Bought this for my 12 year old gymnast who has Osgood Schlatter's Disease in both knees. She uses it on both knees with no problem and it does fit well and relieves the knee pain.
3,Good Product but not a silver bullet,"This product works well in conjunction with other types of therapy like Stretching Icing, and general PT.I would recommend it as part of a therapeutic solution."
5,Cho-Pat,Order was received quickly as described. The sizing may be a bit off as the medium is almost too large for me but it does work. I would go with a small next time.
4,Cho-pat knee strap,Hold up very well. I always play tennis with them on and have had 1 pair for over a year.
3,blackberry winter:my earlier years,"My bookclub chose this book. I found it quite interesting, but had to do some research to understand what M. Mead was talking about. I probably would not have chosen this, but did find it informative."
4,Love it!,"I purchased this from Target 4 or more years ago. A couple times a year I take down and clean off soap residue etc. on caddy and suction cups. No big problem getting suction cups to hold. This last time, I noticed rust on the soap tray and cleaned it with a rough scrub pad and put back up on shower wall (smooth fiberglass type) hoping for the best. I always try to fix something before replacing, especially since chrome is probably not recyclable. Within 2 weeks I noticed and smelled rust on my soap and wash cloth. Ugh! Started looking for a replacement on Amazon. As I was reading comments on several products, someone said they solved their rust problem with a Calcium, Lime Rust Cleaner. It is now on my shopping list to check out. So, I am not ready to trash it yet."
3,"Lack of Real, Sustaining Suction","We bought this shower basket based on several positive reviews on Amazon; however, it's rather a disappointment. It fell down three times in the first week. Finally, I took it down -- and only put it back up after attaching it to some of those 3M water-resistant hooks. It's okay, but not quite as advertised . . . or as expected."
3,suction on tiles,"I love the basket,, but the suction cups have to be lined up with my subway tiles. The only way I can get it secure is to hang it crooked. I just decided to keep it and use it that way. It didn't seem worth the trouble to return it and look for something that works better. The basket itself is well made."
4,Works well but sometimes slips down.,"I like this 2 tiered basket design. It is a very handy basket. However, once in a while I clean the walls and I have some difficulty getting it to stick back without slipping. In addition, the suction cups lose their grip after about 2 years of use. The basket stays in great shape and can be washed in the dishwasher. The suction cups should be replaceable.I have also used some of the products at Bed Bath & Beyond with better suction cups. These seem to do a marginally better job staying on. However, the suction cups are protected and last for years. They even cost a little less. They just don't have the 2 tier basket shape that I like."
5,Perfect shower caddy,I have this shower caddy in the main bath shower. It has enough storage for my needs. It does not rust. The suction cups are strong enough to hold a full basket on the wall until I choose to remove it for cleaning. I purchased this one for the second/ hall bath. Replaces one of those crummy baskets that hang off the shower head. I'm happy.
3,it stays on the wall,Nice item.It stays on the wallit could be a little larger.It will not hold large shampoo bottles.The soap dish is a nice feature to keep soaps dry.
5,Great Investment...Literally.,"I picked up a good second-hand copy from Amazon the day Reg passed away for $2 and now secondhand copies are selling for $387.00 minimum.I didn't even think about it as an investment at the time,I just wanted to read what Reg thought about aliens and crop circles.It was like having a one way chat at a bar with my old mate.I loved that someone as famous as Reg had the guts to say what he felt about the phenomena,not that I agree with all his views on the subject,but it was food for thought and entertaining to me.Cheers Reg,it's great to know this book is a better investment than gold and a better read.-)"
4,Cute,"We love happy tree friends, and flippy is my wife's favorite. It's a cute novelty, but I can see that the image will rub off if actually used as a wallet. It seems to be nothing more than acrlic paint on nylon. So, because it's not sewn in or anything more permanent, I give it one less star for lack of durability."
5,Grandson requested this,My 9 year old grandson has been talking about wanting a Hess truck for quite some time and now he's very happy to have one. I'm sure there will be more coming.
5,Great buy!!!! My grandsons look forward to these trucks every Christmas.,"These trucks are durable, extreemly well made with several working parts. My grandsons play with them off and on all year.They look forward to receiving them each year. It's easy, I count on Amazon to have what I need. Thank you for your prompt service."
3,Hess is usually great but this one not so much,"My son loves all things helicopters but this one the first time we played with it the roater stopped turning seemed like a piece fell off as when we move it you can hear something moving around - my husband took it apart and sure enough is trying to perform some surgery but not hopeful. This might have to be an ""imaginary"" toy vs. having live action :). Packaging etc was great but maybe the toy was sitting around a little too long"
3,"My kids love it, but it dropped once and tail part came off.","My kids love these. We just got them yesterday, however...he was playing, it fell off the table, ONCE about 18 inches from the ground or less and I picked up the helicopter to see that one of the tailparts came off. I thought Hess was a bit more durable than this. I don't think I'll be buying one of these again. And they are not cheap...:-)"
3,Natasha Henstridge in a enjoyable thriller..,"brief plot: a used-book store owner's life starts to gets interesting when a mysterious woman enters his life. She is hit by a car and, when recovering consciousness, has a case of amnesia. The store owner falls in love with her.things get complicated when they both try to re-trace her life history. They find her apartment, and a sack full of cash as well inside it. He soon suspects that she is hiding something, but he has secrets of his own..personal comments: I'm a fan of Natasha Henstridge, so I'm a little biased in favor of this film. Having said that, the plot twists and turns keep the viewer guessing, and a brief appearance by Peter Fonda adds to the quality of the film.*recommended viewing*"
4,Review,"The plot begins with the sizzling Natasha Henstrige, having a smoke. After a brief confrontation with Sam, a book store owner, gets ""smashed"" by a car and -Lo and Behold- , she winds up with amnesia. She proceeds to fall in love with Sam, only later realising that she was supposed to kill the guy. The reason? For susposedly stealng money from this guy.The trouble starts.Nausiating, but very enjoyable"
1,Not good.,"Henstridge is the best thing in this. Angus Mc-whats-his-name is atrociously bad. Mind numbingly, indescribably terrible. Perhaps the worst acting I have ever seen outside of ""Battlefield Earth"". The plot of this thing is dumb-o. At the end it was aiming to be ""daughter-of-Basic-Instinct"" - and missing that particular target by about a zillion miles. This isn't even good B-movie fare. It is very bad maybe Z-movie fare. I think I am gonna use the DVD for wind chimes."
5,"photo album, cozee world","This is a beautiful photo album, with alot of fabulous detail. It is completely handmade. The creativity of this album is amazing."
5,Photo happy,"I actually bought this photo album because it was cheaper than the 40 picture albums that I typically buy for my vacation photos. I was a little hesitant about the quality, since it was cheaper, but it turned out to be just as good. I was very pleased, since we had more pictures to choose from this year as well. I actually ended up buying another one from the same place and am very happy with the purchase of both."
5,Cho-Pat Saved my Marathon,"New orthotics were thrashing my knees, just as my training was gearing up for Catalina Marathon. I thought I might have to skip it this year until my podiatrist, also a marathoner, recommended these simple little straps. I wore them with pants to work, etc., for a few days before I started running in them, to get used to the velcro thingies in the back. (It's a good idea to wear Body Glide under the velcro for long distance.) Wow, I continued my training without pain, and soon was running hills again. I finished my race without ANY knee inflammation!"
2,"Hard to read, hard to digest","I don't disagree with other reviewers on the contents of this book. It's comprehensive. My complaint is with the format and layout of the book. Dozens of UPPERCASE and italicized sections on every page make it hard to read and hard to follow. I am frustrated every time I pick it up. Speaking of systems, a book of this type is a system for delivery of information. A basic understanding of how people absorb that information should have led to a more readable layout without the formatting distractions that this book has. Thumbs down if you want to enjoy learning more about SE."
4,not bad,"a little wordy, but i thought it did a good job of providing applicable examples and wasn't hard to read."
1,Rotten Book,"I'm a true-crime addict so this book looked really interesting. And indeed the basic story would make a gripping book in the right hands. But it is so badly written that after a while I was just gritting my teeth and plowing through it to finally reach the end of the tale. The chief writer is surely an amateur, and needs some writing courses and much better editing than he got! It's a shame, because this story had enough elements to make a really good read. But the co-authors' egos are too prominent in the narrative, the cliches smell of tabloids, and if I hear the word ""gently"" anytime soon again, I'll probably have to throw up."
1,such poor writing!,"It is an interesting story, and in the hands of someone like Ann Rule, it would have been amazing.The poor writing is such a distraction, it is hard to read it."
3,"Interesting, but less than stellar","I too was rather annoyed by the writing style and narration of this book. Too much info about Linda O'Neal and a little too much grandstanding.I would have liked to have learned more about Ward Weaver's strange background, as well as more about the background of the girls and what possessed Ashley Pond's mother to allow her daughter to live with Ward Weaver when she (Ashley's mother)clearly stated she neither liked or trusted him. The writers skirted around the issues of parental responsiblity. At the end of the book, great detail is provided regarding how parents can protect their kids from predators....however, in the case of Ashley Pond, her mother handed her over to a predator. Shame on her."
1,Don't bother,"I wish I could have given this book a rating of NO stars. Through the tragedy of Ashley and Miranda's death, Child Welfare and Law Enforcement Agencies now cross report. I wanted to find out the history that brought about this monumental policy. Boy was I disappointed. The author and her husband claim they are the ""step-grandparents"" of Ashley Pond, however according to the lineage they have no legal relation to Ashley.This book was written to allow Linda O'Neal a tool to brag about her role in the investigation for Ashley and Miranda. It seems the author forgets that the memories of Ashley and Miranda and how their killer was brought to justice should be the most important part of the book."
3,Interesting but not thorogh,"I live in Portland and followed this case fairly close from day one. The author helped shed a bit more light than various media reports. Personally, I think the author should have delved more into the personal lives of Lori Pond and Michelle Duffy. Perhaps this would have given more light to why the girls were allowed to be around a known sex offender. I think some of the book centered around the author herself and some of her personal life. The book was interesting but not as detailed as it could have been. Ann Rule would have been a good author for this particular story."
2,It depend on what you are looking for .....,"This is a great book, if you want your child to think of all kinds of great things you can do with your hands.but..If you are looking for a book to teach your child WHY you should not hit or anything about feeling and emotions involve in hitting than this is NOT the book for you."
4,Almost perfect,"Contrary to the impression given in one of the other reviews here, this printer is perfectly compatible with Linux and Macintosh as well as Windows. It may not be a PostScript printer, but there are drivers for Linux available from the Konica Minolta site. Yes, it would be nice if it had PostScript on board, but I'm happy enough to have the computer do the rasterizing via GhostScript. I plugged the printer in via Ethernet, installed the drivers, and the Mac found the printer via Bonjour.As far as photographic quality goes, on glossy paper the images are better than the glossy magazines on my coffee table, and with a cost per page less than a tenth of that of an inkjet. It has become my primary printer. For the occasional true photographic print, there are always camera stores.What could be better? Give it PostScript and a duplexer and I'd declare it perfect. (There's an optional duplexer, but it's really expensive.)"
1,Frequent smearing,"The printer set up easily, etc. The problem is it smears on an erratic basis. I have tried different kinds of paper and different settings. The only setting that won't result in a smear is ""glossy"" paper, which slows the printer way down. I have used it enough to change cartidges and this did not take care of the problem.I regret this purchase. I had read about the smearing problem on the 2400 but hadn't read about it here. If I had it to do all over I would not have bought this printer.P.S. I found the problem. If you lift the lid there are two latches. The raised position is for heavy envelopes, etc. and the lowered position is for paper. The printer came with one lever up and one lever down, which created my horrible smearing problem. Considering the consequences, Konica should have been very clear about positioning these levers in their materials."
4,Good budget printer,"Great prints, pretty inexpensive. A bit noisy though. It also would have been nice to have a seperate feeder tray. You have to remove the paper move the slides then insert your envelop or special paper. Other than that no complaints. Worth the $400."
1,DO NOT GET THIS PRINTER,"I had bought this printer when it was much more expensive about 4-5 years ago. In the past couple of years, I kept getting the ""front cover open"" which according to fixya.com is an indication that some type of pin which gets triggered when the cover closes, got broken somehow. I would end up having to open/close the cover multiple times before the message went away and would be allowed to print. Now the problem is that the paper isn't getting picked up. I didn't use this printer that much so it can't be a problem with worn out parts. I'm really, really ticked about this as I have in the past year and half replaced the toner for all four cartridges and obviously it wasn't cheap. I suspect this brand is just shoddy - I was counting on the Minolta part being better, but would have been better off with a Canon."
2,Get what you paid for,"Bought this printer 1 year ago. After the first month the control chip died and returned it for a new printer. After 1 year the printer died again, again it was the control chip but unfortunately the printer was out of warranty. The chip cost $150, the printer cost me $200. I just bought a new black toner. I would rate this a 4 had it not been for the quality issues."
1,"It's a ""GDI"" Winprinter, no PCL5, no color postscript, get the 2350en","We run a office LAN where there are Windows machines mixed with an increasing number of Apple Macs and Linux desktops, and also a couple of Unix servers.We needed a color laser printer that speaks ""standards"", either PCL5 or PostScript. Well, we quickly found out that the 2430DL speaks no standard. It's a ""GDI Printer"" which are also dubbed ""winprinter"", as it implements the windows GDI on the drivers. There are some linux drivers for ""GDI"" but they're experimental at best. And Microsoft gets a piece of the action for the GDI code in the printer. So they win both ways... the printer manufacturer pays them, and the consumer gets a piece of junk guaranteed to work perfectly only in windows.We traded this printer back to a 2350EN model which is a true laser, doing PCL5 and color postscript, and as such, instantly compatible with almost every operating system on Earth, and certainly all in our office."
3,THE BEST SEAGAL DTV SINCE BELLY OF THE BEAST,"The plot of Shadowman is a bit over-complicated...and it really doesn't break any new ground...BUT Seagal looks committed to this movie. Almost no fight doubles, he does his own over-dubbing, and acts like he is having a better time than he has in some of his past direct-to-video films. Movies seem to be an after thought. Check out his CD's to hear Seagal's totally passionate about what he is doing -- playing the blues."
5,Time to give up movies Seagal..way past time.,"I knew he was out of shape/overweight but in this film,he must beeven worse-off, considering there's a stunt for him walking,infights,running.He's always played some CIA or ex CIA - but thisfilm is more boring then those of the past.Also there is little hand-to-hand combat in this filmdon't expect any fight quality of Out For Justice or TheGlimmer Man.In the end,his eye-poke to a guy does ginzu-like damage,he hitsanother guy in the chest - and his back explodes.Rent first ifyou can..this is worse then his films years before."
2,Poor Stuff,"Steven Seagal was never a great actor, even in his prime. He was a good action star though. I've always had some respect for him as he's a 7th Dan in Akido and a respected martial arts practioner. However this is a sadly unconvincing film that does him no credit at all.Now rapidly approaching the age of 56, Seagal has put on a lot of weight and his acting and delivery is even more wooden than it was. Sure the fight scenes are good, close-up its obvious he knows his stuff and you wouldn't want to mess with him, but as an action star his time has passed. The plot such that there is really isn't worth describing, and the only redeeming element was Imelda Staunton's performance as the American Ambassador, which is a class above the rest of the cast.My recommendation rent don't buy this."
3,so-so,"segal is losing his bad guy thing, getting old and slow, but it was watchable, would not buy it for like$10 or more dollars"
3,Great Service - Weak Movie!,The movie was shipped quickly and was in the condition described. The film itself was a flop - I haven't seen a more mediocre piece of cinema in some time...but I asked for it so that is no reflection on the seller!
2,Completely outdated,"This book is very slow reading, even for ISO related material. Also, potential readers should beware that this material is VERY outdated. So much so, that the ,""Word processor templates, worksheets, and examples"" that are included to ""help users convert plans into the required documentation"" aren't compatible with any system that runs the current Windows OS. This makes the book and the material within it useless. The fact that the publisher fails to mention this is also misleading at best. One wonders when someone will bat these people into the present day and give them a clue that 98% of their customers use Windows 98 (or better)....."
5,Excellent!,I could never handle pancakes even though I liked them on occasion because I would be hungry an hour later. Now that I found I am insulin resistant I tried these with Walden Farms sugar free syrup. They are great. Because of the high protein it keeps me until the next meal. The recipe for mixing actually makes two servings so I just save the other in the refrigerator until a day or two later.I cannot understand the reviewer who says they don't cook in the center. I have had no problem with that. In fact they cook up very fast for me.
4,Only way to go when you are watching hour carbs.,"This pancake and waffle mix does not taste exactly like traditional pancake mix. But, it is good and worth buying if you are watching your carbs. Just buy some Guar Gum, and make your own Maple Syrup, with no carbs, to go with it."
5,Great tasting,This lo carb pancake mix is really good and easy to make.You can't even tell it's a lo carb product. I made some pancakes with it and give one to my boyfriend. He couldn't even tell it was a lo carb product.I would buy this again.
2,Nice calorie count but .... zero flavor!,"So i'm dieting and I wanted to try the pancakes because they are advertised as low cal, good for you stuff. Like for the whole mix, 90 calories. Cool. Except to actually make the pancakes, it is now 190. And the mixture tastes like flour and water! I couldn't do it, I had to add sugar. Which totally defeats the purpose of these pancakes. Also, the bag of mix is extremely small. You can make 2 batches of little size pancakes with it. Stupid."
5,Best low carb pancakes ever!,If you didn't know they were low carb then you'd never know. Most low carb products taste ok but these are really good. I am so glad I found these! Wish this company made more items.
3,It works.,Not the greatest tasting but it works well. I was looking for a cheaper replacement to medifast foods and it worked.
5,great,delicious. moist. taste pretty much like the real thing.i have blueberry pancakes with these all the time. great for breakfast.
2,SHOCKED!,"I just ordered this product and have not even tried it yet, but I was shocked when I received it and realized that I had just paid $10 for what looks like a ""sample"". The UPS man delivered a box about the size a paperback book comes in. I thought, wonder what that is, I don't recall ordering a book! Then I opended the box to find this pancake mix. All I can say is unless these pancakes are the BEST I have EVER eaten in my ENTIRE life I will NEVER be ordering this again!!"
3,please remove review,I can't figure out how to write someone in charge at Amazon but that first review was apparently written by my 'ex'. Some relationships really end badly. Would you be kind enough to delete it?I have a new book releasing soon and plan to use your Amazon link feature to link my new book with this one.I appreciate your help and concern in this matter.
2,"Some nice ideas, but ...","Easy: good. Simple: good. So far, so good. But Eaton dispenses with too many really basic techniques -- for simplicity, I suppose -- for reliably good results. For example: you simply MUST use a smaller needle for a rib edging; otherwise it flares. And although three-needle bindoffs are neat and stylish, most adult sizes need a little shoulder shaping to look anything but terribly bulky and boxy. Finally, IMO no design calling for 60% seed stitch quit qualifies as a ""quick knit,"" even in a largish gauge.The photographs don't really display the designs well; the garments of the grownups squatting behind children are really hard to evaluate. Intentionally obscured? Maybe because the patterns are really too squared-off to look good on anyone over age six...?I got partway through one little sweater and stopped to regroup with a different pattern from another source.I wanted to like this book, but won't trust my investments of time and yarn to such oversimplified directions."
1,not MinnowKnits,I love the patterns in the MinnowKnits series and have made several of them but was disappointed with this book.
3,Cute but simple,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews I read before I purchased the book. Although there are some cute patterns in the book, I will probably not knit any of them. If you are a new knitter, you might enjoy knitting a few of the patterns.I admit, I was disappointed, I had expected more."
1,Extremely Frustrating!,"This book looks very easy at first glance, but the many inaccuracies make it maddening. I am in the midst of the first project (furry cardigan for a child) and so far it took 4 tries to get the right gauge (she says size 13, I ended up on a 10.5 even though on all other projects I've done my gauge is accurate), and she specifically states that the pattern done with Furz won't curl, which it definitely is doing. Aargh!!!! I'm ready to throw it out the window."
1,Surprised authors name is not RJJ Olkiente,"If you have read the LOTR more than once, nothing in this book will surprise you. Disappoint, yes; surprise, no. Whole sections are completely ripped off from Moria, and every other major battle and event. I fing the VeggieTales ""Lord of the Beans"" is more original and entertaining than this re-hash.Fortunately (for the bored who can't quite bring themselves to put it down), there is a handy appendix of Tuck's diary. This useful feature allows us to find out what happens in the rest of the book without actually reading all of it. A very handy feature for bad fantasy, and I hope other authors begin to follow suite.If you are thinking of buying this book, please don't. If you must satisfy your curiosity, there is probably a copy at your local library that nobody has checked out. Take that as a sign.A much better series that I am reading is the Furies series (Codex Alera) from Jim Butcher. THAT series is worth reading!!"
4,warrows rule!,"Dennis L. McKiernan's Iron Tower gives fantasy readers what they enjoy, fast paced action with brave little heroes. Although it is an obvious off shoot of Tolkien it keeps you entertained. The main characters are well thought out and the story line keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens next. The story introduces the little people called Warrows. They are excellent bowmen and fierce and brave fighters. This new race of little people is still treated like a childlike race but quickly earns respect that the kenders of Dragonlance never do and they prove themselves more than simple folks like hobbits and halflings. Give this book a try!"
2,It had so much promise...,"To date this is the most blatent copy of Tolkiens work. However, Mckiernan does admit this in the opening pages. Still if you are going to copy the master at least do it in a way that would honor his memory. This novels characters were shallow and very unrealistic in their interactions with each other and their enviroment. I was very dissapointed. The only way this novel recieved the two stars that it did was because of the ending. This at least showed some originality."
2,Bored,"I started reading the iron tower and right from the first chapter the story it very familiar. I only got a quarter of the way in and then I stopped because I did not like the very obvious copying of the lord of the rings.However, I have a comment to one of the other reviewers who claimed that Jordan's and Brook's series were nock offs of Tolkien's work and I want to know what he was thinking to make such a comparison. Personally, I got bored with the lord of the rings, I read them but nothing in them remotely apeals to me. However, I loved both of Brooks and Jordan's novels and I can not see where the comparison is made.However, although I did not enjoy the lord of the rings I will say that anyone who wants to read the iron tower should first read the lord of the rings and then try the iron tower."
2,No pizzaz.,"This book starts out fairly promising, interesting characters, nice background, good detail. There's even a large siege battle about a third of the way into the book that is fairly well written. But then its almost like the writer got tired, perhaps a ghost writer or student took over? Your interest fades rather rapidly, but you continue on vainly hoping the spark will be re-ignited. For me, it never was."
4,Tolkien copied the Bible ..Iron Tower copies Tolkien,This is a seminal work by a gifted author. The one big difference from Tolkien to DMc is he doesn't excessively described the endless details that Professor Tolkien does. Its a step below but well worth the time IMHO!
1,"You're kidding, right?","I found a copy of ""The Iron Tower"" in a shoebox of books I bought at a yard sale recently. I read the back cover and was greeted with the line, ""Dennis L. McKiernan's Mithgar books are among the most beloved in all of fantasy fiction."" Well this book is a must read then, right? Right??Don't believe everything you read.I struggled about a third of the way into the 600 page novel before I realized this was one of the worst fantasy novels I had ever read. Never mind the derivative story; the novel itself is badly written. One of the most glaring problems is the excessive use of passive voice. While it is not techincally wrong, it comes off as amateur and hackneyed. Also, any time an author uses ""lo!"" in the course of his writing, and is attempting a serious tone, I cringe. I cringed a lot while reading this."
2,The most blatant copy of Lord of the Rings ever,"This is the most blatant copy of The Lord of the Rings of any fantasy trilogy I've ever read. For instance, the names of the Warrows are so much like Hobbit names they could be Hobbit names, and the plot is practically identical. Still, if you hunger for more Tolkien and have read all his works, this will satisfy the hunger a little. It's ""cram"" to Tolkien's ""lembas"", though."
1,Everyone who says this is a pale copy of Tolkien is absolutely right,"This book was originally written as a sequel to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels, or so the Wikipedia page on Dennis McKiernan says. Then McKiernan could not get the rights to create a sequel, so he messed with the names of people and species and published the books anyway. It's easy to see that this is the case because the book is a completely slavish imitation of Tolkien's story and Tolkien's world, only altered in not-at-all-subtle ways that only serve to diminish the original LOTR story into a pale and unsatisfying imitation.Don't waste your money."
3,wrong color,"I wanted one basket like the one in the picture, with black embroidery, but I got one with white embroidery instead. I don't have time to exchange it casue my wedding is around the corner. I will still use it, it's beautiful, but I would have preferred it how the seller described it."
5,"The ""Bible"" of Civil War Naval Research!!","A collection of thousands of documents containing orders, accounts of engagements, crew data and administrivia -- all written by Naval officers on the scene. Though it can be rather boring at times, it is THE SOURCE for all kinds of historical and genealogical information on the Civil War Navy and its personnel. The text of 27 volumes (@800 pages, each) on one SEARCHABLE CD!! Gotta love technology!!"
4,Blair defined,"I got this for my son. He's a real deal Blair-ite. He says, ""You want the skinny on Blair... GET THIS BOOK! MUST HAVE! Bloody shame it isn't being sent to every library in the country and the local bookstores (including Waldenbooks) don't carry it! Thank Heavens for Amazon!"""
5,Answers to Key Issues,"This book is an easy read providing answers to the many difficult questions surrounding Generation Y. Mr. Tulgan identifies important characteristics, and management techniques for dealing with Generation Y employees. Perhaps the best tools are the ""real-life"" practices he outlines to deal with the fouteen characteristics of the new workforce. I highly recommend this work for any manager with young employees."
4,Good Basic Information,"Managing Generation Y gives a good overview of the characteristics of this age group. This book gives some practical tips, and some food for thought to develop your own tips, on how to best manage people of this generation.I found the book useful."
1,Yikes!,"I've never written an opinion before, but this book needs one.I've been bulimic for many years, and blindly pulled it off a book shelf and started reading. It turned my from a binge purge four times a day bulimic to a not eating for days anorexic. The guidelines for ""things to do instead of eating"" were wonderful, but you find yourself at the intersection of not knowing exactly when its okay to eat. In the whole three week program at the end of the book, only once did it mention to have a ""meal"" to enjoy.I respect the author, but i'm firm in my beliefs that if you have an impressionable mind, you might want to find a softer method to help yourself, instead of no eat boot came."
1,nothing novel,"I have read just about everything written with regard to eating disorders since about the beginning of time, and this book stands out as one of the starkest examples of someone trying to exploit the disease and make a career out of being a ""recovered eating disorder."" Aside from this, the book offers no insight that cannot be found in any other routine book on eating disorders. A waste of my money, and even more disappointing, a waste of my time."
1,not a way out,"the book gives good ideas about ""what to do instead of a bing"" but provides no guidelines...it is incoherent, it at the border of psychobabble...i did not like it at all!!!!!!!Other self help book, written by doctors are much much more useful !!!!!"
1,Not impressed!,"This book gives a comprehensive list of things to do instead of binging, but I think the average person can think of those things by themselves, just because we're bulimic doesn't mean we're stupid! The authors don't give any useful techniques for overcoming bulimia, besides writing about it in a journal? wtf? Since when does writing out your feelings in a journal make you want to quit your bulimic habits?I would reccomend the Remuda Ranch to any serious bulimic, save your money for psychotherapy and don't buy this book."
1,Waste of time,"Warren Zanes readily admits that the book is not specifically about the album, ""Dusty in Memphis"", but I never did figure out what it was supposed to be about. It seems to be a rambling dissertation about what a non-Southerner thinks the South is or what it should be or what it could be if it wasn't what it is or, oh, I don't know. Whatever it is, it's just not all that interesting. There is hardly any mention of Dusty Springfield, and little more about any of the music, the production, or the players. If that's what you looking for, don't bother with this book."
2,Very little about the album itself,"I'm a big fan of Dusty in Memphis, and always looking for new information and comments. I bought this book thinking that it would actually be about the album. It's not. Don't get me wrong -- it's actually an interesting little read. But it's more about the author and his opinions on the American south. There's very little in the book about the album itself. The writing is a tad self-absorbed, although it is well-written and informed. It's just not about Dusty in Memphis -- or, if so, only peripherally. False advertising, if you ask me."
2,Disappointing treatment of a great album,"This is a disappointing treatment of a great album. ""Dusty in Memphis"" is not only Dusty Sprignfield's best piece of work, it's one of the best albums ever, a true soul classic. Sadly, Zane doesn't do his homework, failing to discuss how the album was actually put together--why Dusty chose the songs she did, who played on what track, the musical context of the time, etc. He commits the worst sin of a critic in that he talks more about himself (i.e., the fact that he once saw a southern woman take off her clothes in front of window!) than the work he is reviewing. Zane really doesn't seem to know much about this album or the South. Much of what he says would get flagged in your average college essay. Unfortunately, rock criticism can sometimes be some of the worst writing you can find. ""Dusty in Memphis"" deserves better."
2,If they were leaving it all up to me...,"I was glad to finally be able to watch some of the old D & M shows again. The shows that are included are fun to watch although quite hokey (intentionally). However, this set falls far short of what it should/could have been. There are only two episodes per disc in this ""Best Of"" two-disc set. Why not release an entire season or, even better, the complete series in a package? Hopefully that collection is still to come...in my Deep Purple dreams."
3,"""I'll Be Back""","A reasonably well-told story with a few reasonably unpredictable twists, ROBOCOP: PRIME DIRECTIVES is reasonably entertaining television fare.I had the chance to view this miniseries when it played on America's SCI-FI Channel, and I was incredible overwhelmed with the poor production quality only so far as the sound mixing goes. Throughout much of the four installments, the varying levels made the dialogue very difficult to hear, throughout any of the action sequences primarily. There were a few moments -- especially in the last two hours -- where sections of dialogue were barely audible! It could've been the broadcast signal, but, given the consistency of the sound levels throughout the entire miniseries, I'm tending to believe that wasn't the case.Of course, I don't know if that's been corrected for the DVD releases, but, were I you, I'd stronly recommend a rental of this item b/f a purchase."
3,"Without the name robocop, its two stars.","So I'm a big fan of just cheesy terrible movies - I love them for their badness. I'm also a fan of Robocop - i love him for his awesomeness. So, with the budget used, everyone thinks that they could do better. Probably so. Its poorly characterized and the guy playing robocop is easily the most terrible and mis-cast robo ever. But hey - It's still robocop, right? Easily the best of the ""Prime Directives"" movies. And the story of Murphy's lead-up to transferring and that fateful showdown that made him robocop IS kind of interesting and neat. But yeah - for the true ALL THINGS ROBOCOP kinda fan ... not for the purist or passive onlooker."
2,I'd get it...if it was a 4 disc pack.,This has how many dvds this series? Four? And they're charging thirteen dollars a DVD to watch eight hours?Be realistic. I'd buy it if it was all four together for thirteen dollars. The movie isn't what it was before. They made Robocop weaker than his TV debut.And they are going to charge us seventy dollars (including the shipping and handling of course) to buy four lame eight hour movies to watch maybe two or three times. DVD Rentals where are you? Nobody is going to pay that much for eight hours of a dull run.
1,Worst than Robocop 3,"Everything about this movie is a monstrosity. The only thing that would even be considered as descent is the story line. How does a machine/human have the ability to cry? Unless there's an evolution in his organic parts that allow him to have human fluids, there is no sense at all. Then in the past, Alex Murphy looks like he's in his 60s, wasn't he about 40 when he transfered in Detroit in Robocop? I rather watch Robocop 3 which they also screwed up on. The only true Robocop is Peter Weller w/ Paul Verhoeven and Irvin Kershner as the directors. ALL OTHERS SUCK!"
1,AAAAAAAAAAhahahahahahahahahaha,It's a multi-part television miniseries with a cumulative budget lower than just the first theatrical Robocop. The plot is a computer virus that can come out of your monitor and eat you. Robocop is a good 6 inches shorter than every other character. Everyone is related because DRAMA. There is a scene where robocop hides his identity in a market by wearing a huge cloak.This movie stinks on ice is what I'm saying.
3,"Too Many Flashbacks, Not enough RoboCop Action","I got RoboCop last night. I watched it and thought there were too many flashbacks in it before Murphy got shipped into Metro South in the First film. Robo wasn't seen enough i thought. Also a huge thing I felt was missing was the extra features. Like the Audio Commentary and the Behind the scenes documentary. The trailer advertises all 4 parts, But they only put part 1 out. Where is the other 3 parts. I will prohahly watch this often. However they should of released a box set of this instead of a empty disc. No one seems to be carrying this DVD either in the stores. I had to special order mine. Let's face it, the RoboCop franchise needs some major improvements. So I'd reccommend this to any RoboCop fan, but not the average moviegoer."
5,Psychologists' Helper,"The best self-help book in decades. - insightful, sensitive, and humorous. Psychologists should buy it and recommend it to their patients."
4,Cinnamon junkie,"I love cinnamon in all forms but am not eating sugar these days. I love these candies but they're higher in carbs than I would prefer. I didn't really want 10 bags but the alternative was $6 per bag. That said, they're yummy, very cinnamony and on the strong side, which is perfect for me."
3,Close to what I expected,"The cross and necklace is more fragile than expected, but for the money it is a good value. My daughter was pleased with the gift."
2,Narcissistic main character,"I have all Danielle Steele's older books & since the horrible book 'The Klone & I', I am careful about which books of hers I select. There has been a couple of good ones since - this is not one of them. I could not stand the main character & was quite tempted more than once to put the library book down but I did go ahead & finish the book. At least the character had sense enough to take a 2nd chance on love but he was still a narcissist."
3,Not enough power for my mattress,"Pros:- Better than battery-powered ones, which eventually can't hold a charge anymore.- Car power adapter is included.- low priceJust one major downside:I have an air mattress that requires a higher powered pump, since its valve doesn't create a seal. Maybe this is by design to prevent over-inflation. The problem is, the Texsport does not provide the power needed. The mattress is saggy even after the pump has done all it could.I decided to buy a double-action manual pump, which does much better (but I had to use a balloon to create a seal)."
2,Not enough power,"I bought this item to fill a float tube when I go trout fishing. Unfortunately, it's not powerful enough to completely fill the float tube."
4,decent pump,"I've used this pump through two summers already for inflating all of our beach balls, pools, etc. It's a little slow, but does the job and takes up very little storage space."
3,It's okay,"It works decent enough. Only reason I say it that was is have had one very similar before that put out more air, which this one could use as it's just ""adequate."" I only used the car plug-in, not the electric. I'm going to still use it as don't feel like shopping for another one. Wish could tell you which one to go buy, but since can't will tell you that if you can't figure that piece out yourself either, go ahead and buy this one, since it does in fact get the job done and who knows, another one might not do that much."
2,delivery,"l ordered two items 1 air mattres, 1 texsport two-way electris pump. The air mattres comes within two days but the two ways pump the delivery scheduled date on Sept 9 2010....l just wandering what happened the the 2 days delivery. l'm confused"
3,Photo is misleading ...,"When the plates arrived, I almost expected something to bebroken but everything came in good condition.I bought two sets for our family of 5.Here's the breakdown of the charge.Item(s) Subtotal: $159.98Shipping & Handling: $0.00Promotional Certificate:$-25.00Promotion Applied: $-16.00Total for this Shipment:$118.98I noticed right away that the designs on theplate seemed very faded and not as bright/detailed asthe design shown on the description photo.I was a little dissappointed but we decided to keep the sets.The square design is very nice and I like thethickness of the mugs. A little strange drinkingfrom a square shaped mug but no one seems to mind too much.The plates are also very sturdy.I had dropped one in the sink and it surprisingly did not break.It's a good purchase for the price I paid ($59.49 per set)but I wouldn't purchase these for the full price of $79.99."
1,extremely disappointed,I've had several sets of corelle over the years and my daughter picked out this set for a gift. The first plate out of the box was so poorly printed out of line that single branch tips were double branch tips. In looking over the dishes the picture quality was very coarse and looked and felt like a decal. We didn't even open the second box because we knew we were sending it back.
2,not so hot.,"I'm sure these dishes are durable and practical, as are all corelle dishes-- the problem is the quality of the decoration. It looks INCREDIBLY cheap and tacky in person. The online image does not accurately reflect the look of the real product. By the way, I sent these back a long time ago and have yet to see my card be credited for the return."
3,Pattern is Crappy,"I ordered these plates, and when they came the pattern is nowhere near as clear and pretty as it is in the photos. It looks like it was printed on an inkjet printer that was almost out of ink. There are faded lines, and places where the color is almost all gone. I was very, VERY disappointed."
4,Gift for Parents,I bought this for my parents as their plates are showing wear. These were a welcome replacement to their kitchen. They weigh a fraction of the old plates and appear to be much tougher as well. Can't go wrong with Corelle.
1,Pictures shows bright clear colors... not what we recieved,"As soon as I opened the box I was immediately disapointed because the colors are dull, clearly printed on, with the lines not aligned properly resulting in a faded blurry picture. VERY DISAPOINTED. Probably going to return, it would be embaressing showing these to people.Is this a nock-off version of Corelle or what?"
2,"horrible printing, VERY PIXILATED","i bought two types of plate sets from corelle. one was this cherry blossom &the other one was the impression white flower. when i received it, i was very sad of how horrible the printing was for the this one (cherry blossom) it looks very pixilated and cheap, the white flower one isn't to love either (but still better quality- so i will be keeping those). i will be returning these plate sets, sad that printing wasn't better. i would have kept this one over the white flower. the bowl isn't so great either, its plane with a slight pink faded lining on the outer part, i hate this the most, looks very cheap. the glass was the only one that lived to my expectations, to bad i can't just keep parts i want to keep. disappointed"
5,love my new dishes,"I got 2 sets of these to replace my heavy, clunky dishes that didn't stack well and chipped way too easily. These stack so nicely, which is important for me because I have a small kitchen with very limited cupboard space. With my old dishes I used to have to keep some of them in my basement, but now I can fit both sets in my kitchen with more room than I had before. They are light and durable, too. I love the cherry blossom pattern, even though I don't normally like pink. It is very pretty and simple. I really like the square shape, I just think it looks a little more modern. They arrived right on time, nothing broken at all. Overall, I'm very happy with them. They are my first set of Corelle and if I ever need to get more dishes I will certainly get Corelle again."
3,pattern looks bad,"I recieved this set and as others stated, it is not the corelle ultra as it shows in the picture. Also the print of the pictures is pretty crappy. It looks like the printing process was messed up and the layers were put on slightly off center so the layers don't line up and it appears blurry. I recieved it as a gift so tried to contact corelle about it but their customer service is terrible. I will never get anything corelle again without buying and seeing it in person at a store. The only thing I like about the set is the square shape.I wanted to post an update. I contacted Corelle and after a struggle by email they ended up sending me new plates (they had the most faded coloring). They are better than the ones I originally got. The color is brighter and looks like the printinting of the pattern was done correctly this time (although the pattern is still a little blurry but now I can tell that is just how it looks, it is not a solid color but rather looks kind of cross hatched)."
5,excellent and beautiful,If you want to buy a corelle dishware this is the place to buy. They are relatively cheaper than buying them at K-mart or Walmart (these are the only places I have near my home). Best quality at the best price
1,Pink,We ordered the plates not knowing they were pink. Needless to say we did not keep them and unfortunately it cost $22 bucks to ship them back.
2,Unrealistic and flawed,"I have just used this book to teach AP Spanish Language in high school. First of all, this book asks for grammatical knowledge way beyond what the students could possibly know and is much more difficult than the actual AP. In the answer section, the book has frequent errors, and many of the explanations only confuse the students. This might be a good book for college-level students - except they wouldn't be taking the AP exam. I recommend José M. Diaz' ""AP Spanish"" Preparing for the Language Examination"" instead."
3,Too many typos,"This book does contain a very comprehensive review for the exam however it has A LOT of typos and errors in the book. There are mispelled words, and some of the answer choices are incorrect, which can be confusing. If you purchase ths book, make sure your AP teacher or a Spanish speaker can review it and point out some of the errors to you. I would hate for you to get a question wrong because of a spelling mistake you saw in this book. Like I said, it is a good review just be aware that this book is far from perfect."
3,does the job but could be better...,it does the job but when my a/c compressor cycles on and off it effects the flash rate. original flasher lasted 12 years til it became intermittent and compressor cycling never change in flash rate. all in all a very good value for the money.
2,Very dissapointed,"I bought this keyboard just about 1 year ago. Over time, my cut, copy and paste keys stopped working. My spacebar sticks. The only good thing is that Fellows is sending me a new keyboard to replace the old one."
2,decent,"not horribly bad, but not great either. i purchased it for the hot keys ""cut, copy and paste"". unfortunately, after about an hour of your computer being on, they stop working. the only way to tell if you have caps lock or num lock on is to have the keyboards program (an annoying blue window that stays on top of every other window) open at all times."
1,Wireless keyboard,I received the Fellowes wireless keyboard today. Set-up is a breeze. I love all the multifunction keys. I have been searching for a wireless keyboard for a long time. What a delight to find this one. It serves all my needs very nicely.
4,Fellowes Keboard,"This is a near great keyboard. Silent keys, decent wireless range(2 meters), and a basic but effective design. There are cut, copy, and paste keys on the side of the keyboard that really come in handy, especially when organizing documents. My only problem with this keyboard is that there are no indicator lights on the keyboard itself. So if you accidentally press the caps lock key or scroll lock, it will show up on your screen. This becomes a problem if you have an older computer that doesn't process things as fast. Other than that, this is a very well made keyboard in which I would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their annoying corded keyboard."
2,i know Cadbury eggs...these are no Cadbury eggs,A disappointment....i threw it away. i thought the egg would be high quality and comparable to Cadbury quality. Did not think egg was high quality milk chocolate and egg was way way overpriced. Next Easter will buy Cadbury milk chocolate.
3,Not that bad,Wow! The other review is pretty scathing! I bought a set of these and they are fine for $39. They don't sound like a set of $500 Infinity speakers but in my office they sound A-OK. The wooptidoo lights are kind of funny and cheezy but mine didn't burn out.
1,What A JOKE these speakers are the WORST,These speaker if you could call them speakers BLOW and I dont mean that in a positive way! They are cheaply made but cost a fortune the sound SUCKS and the woopdidoo lights burn out!! SAVE YOUR MONEY and run from this product....Don
2,"""Elementary, my dear Watson""","This book is a VERY introductory book for MFC and ATL. Holds the reader's hand as they run the wizards and add a couple lines here and there. The various controls and Windows components are only used in the simplest of situations, and the reader is left to deal with any pragmatic use of the control. This is a book to read if you have NO experience at all with MFC, and even then I would strongly suggest having a copy of ""Programming Windows95"" by Petzold on the table next to you."
2,ok,This book is a great introduction to MFC and ATL. I think it help programmers to understand MFC but it also makes you confused. E.g. in the first chapter Views and Docs are explained but in next chapters the Docs are Views aren't used as they were explained and somtimes they aren't even used at all. Simple functions such as scroll bars aren't explained but Controls (Progress Bars etc.) are much easier to use and they are explained in detail.The book is also loaded with ERRORs.The ATL and COM chapters are explained in details and the books gets its 2 stars for that.
2,Simplistic; almost useless for anyone but a beginner,"The ""user level"" on this book centers on ""accomplished"". Nothing could be farther from the truth. The book covers 10 or so sample apps/controls that are basically nothing but ""run the wizard, and add some code"". No real discussion of MFC and how to use it, and the ATL examples are ridiculously simple -- not one of them has any graphic components. If you know nothing about MFC and VC++ 5.0's wizards, then maybe you might want to read this book. But maybe not."
1,Get deceived and Get angry!,"This book is a VERY VERY VERY introductory book, not for experienced programmers. I bought this book for using referrence. But it is filled with too elaborate stuff, I think, useless! For those who have no programming experiece , this book will be a good tutorial, I think."
2,Not a best seller!!,this book was an alright book. It was kind of weird though. I really wouldnt recomend it to people who like to read quality pieces of work. Good thing the books not alot of money or I probably would have never bought the book in the first place. Better luck next time Randy!
2,Disappointing...,"I was looking forward to playing this game with my girlfriend and another couple, but it was awfully disappointing. The biggest problem is the directions, which are so vague and confusing that we basically had to make up our own rules (in terms of board movement, etc.) Incidentally, the board itself that came with the game I bought is very different from the one in the picture above. Another problem is that the questions are often much too difficult - the majority of the time, neither the men nor the women would know the answer. It's mildly entertaining, but if you're looking for a way to pit the men against the women, just buy Cranium and play with gender-based teams. You'll have considerably more fun."
1,Not so great,"I thought I should review this game. I thought it might be fun, so I had mentioned it to my mother as something I might like to get for Christmas. She thought it sounded great, so she got it for me. It was not that fun though. The rules are confusing. The questions are dumb. I swear it seemed like half of the questions for women were about fishing. How many men even know that much about fishing? The questions for the men were also about stupid stuff. The women didn't even know most of the answers. I suppose this game might be more fun for older people who like fishing and sewing, but it is definitly not a game for people in their 20's and 30's."
5,Hilarious fun that runs out,"My boyfriend and I have game nights with another couple and last week they brought this game over. We played it three times that night and we practically died laughing. It was absolutely hilarious to play and we pulled it out first thing again this week. It was just as much fun as the last until we got close to the end of the game and realized that we had cycled through both entire decks of cards. We were even more disappointed to find that they don't offer expansion packs for it. Now we can no longer play one of our favorite new games.And a quick note to the reviewer that said that you can't get past the wild card spot, according to the rules that came with the game we have, you only draw a wild card if you are on the wild card spot at the very end of your turn, so you can go entire games without ever even having to draw a wild card."
4,The Reviews Were Right,"We played this on New Year's Eve. I read all the Amazon.com reviews before purchasing this game. It was fun - we had a lot of laughs. The directions were complicated - we had an attorney read them beforehand and it was STILL confusing and distracting. The game board itself was truly lame.We improvised just like others said they did. There were too many fishing questions and there were too many questions for the guys that the girls didn't even know. (That was one of the changes we made. If the guys got the answer wrong then it was up to the girls to get it right. If they didn't, then the guys got a point. Obviously, the one that read the question abstained for that turn. This applied to both teams.)I'm not sure I would recommend this to a friend. I might suggest trying another game as this is not a cheap game."
3,Not my type of game,"Battle of the Sexes wasn't too bad I suppose, but some of the questions for the females that you ask the opposite sex I didn't even know, so how was a man suppose to know it!"
2,Not much fun,"I bought this game for my parents so we could play it at family get-togethers. I thought it sounded hilarious and thought this would be a good way for the six of us to ""bond."" Sadly, we all hated it, and thought it took too long. I found the questions to be very sexist (though I suppose that might be the idea) and found many of the questions where either no one knew the answer or everyone knew the answer. In this day and age where gender lines are softened, there are few ""male only"" and ""female only"" questions.If you're looking for a guys vs. girls type of game, I would recommend taking a game you already think is fun and dividing up the teams rather than spending your money on this one."
2,Unfair for men,"My husband and I were excited to play this game. However, right when we opened it up we realized the answers/questions are something a man would never guess. The concept is boys vs. girls, but a woman could win the game VERY easily. I would suggest playing this with ONLY women because answers are simple for women if they have any idea of what a car does."
1,A unanimous thumbs down...,"We chose this game for our couples' games night-we were hugely disappointed. Most questions were too difficult for anyone to answer. Would have been much more fun if it was multiple choice. Out of the 6 couples that played the game, we all gave it a thumbs down. Stick with Cranium and Catch Phrase."
1,"pretty lame, stereotypical and kind of damaging","Don't expect to learn something from this game. It takes society back about 20 steps with its stereotypical divisiveness. The questions are poorly worded. The womens' questions aren't even interesting and the mens questions are weird (they were even stumping the men). They were calling it rigged. Some of the people playing the game got kind of upset because they thought the questions were offensive. I mean c'mon ""What kind of nut is used to make Marzipan?"" who cares? Might be a good game for people 55+, but the instructions are pretty difficult and that puts a damper on things also. I will stick with apples to apples, pictionary, catchphrase, scene it, uno, etc. I think you would have more fun with a stick in the mud."
1,Terrible Game,"This game has a great concept but its so stupid. The men will ALWAYS win because the questions they have for the women are stupid, no-brainers... while the mens questions are actually legitimate. Last night my family and I spent an hour playing this game with the men answering questions like ""What is a small bunch of flowers put on a woman's bodice at dances or formals?"" Duh, its a corsage... while us women had to answer questions like ""What is the other name used for Trinitrotoluene?"" Um... HUH? Its the worst game ever. Seriously written by a man, no doubt. Ofcourse the girls team lost as usual last night."
4,Differs for everyone,"I bought this game to be played at my 40th birthday party. We started off with another game which wasn't a big hit. I pulled this one out and we had a blast!! We did the men vs women thing and everyone threw their ego about answering gender questions out the window. There was much discussion and controversy over specifics in answering, which kept things interesting. I will admit that it can get a bit lengthy but we had fun just the same. In fact we enjoyed it so much the first time, we played a second time the same evening. Judging from the reviews I see here, the game differs from group to group. My group consisted of all my friends that didn't really know each other before that night. It was a group of about 12 people overall for the game. And we learned a few things as we went along!!"
2,Sexist Battle,"Fun at first, but then once you enter the never-ending ""wild card"" phase of the game, you quickly get bored. The big flaw of the game is that you cannot win unless you get the rare ""lose a turn"" or ""advance to end"" wild cards. The questions, as mentioned by another reviewer, are cliche - sports and fishing questions are asked to women, cooking and fashion are asked to men. Better games are Cranium or Personalitease."
1,Absolutely painfully awful!,"I realize that this game is supposed to be about knowledge that one sex has and the other doesn't, but why did it seem to us that all the questions for women were about clothes and make-up/perfume? The men didn't fare much better, apparently only supposedly knowing about auto mechanics and sports. Horribly sexist game."
2,Stick with Pictionary or Outburst,"I was expecting better things from this game. I hoped for funnier questions and more interaction. As it was, the game play was stunted and the instructions difficult to understand. The wild cards often ended the game only a few turns into it. The replay value is low as you read every question on ever card. Fishing seemed to dominate the male cards, and how fun a topic is that?"
2,Gender Gap is better!,"Our group of friends plays a game called ""Gender Gap"" quite often (we get together for a game night once a month) and really enjoy the game. When I say this game in a catalog I put it on my Christmas list because it seemed like it would be similar.Unfortunately after reading the rules and looking at the questions, the game is dryer than Gender Gap, and with the limited amount of questions in the game looks like one that won't be a favorite out of our group. Good idea for a game so still a decent game to play, but if you want one like it get Gender Gap instead"
1,Different STYLES of questions....,"Know this before buying the game..... the mens' and womens' questions are entirely two different STYLES of questions. The questions that the women have to answer are ""object based,"" such as, ""What tool would you use to drive a nail into a piece of wood?"" (hammer). The questions the men have to answer are primarily random survey questions that NOBODY knows exactly, such as, ""What PERCENTAGE of women say they enjoy romantic movie comedies more than romance novels?"" Of course the women kicked our butts with us having to answer questions like those, but we tested our theory...We switched the questions. Men answer the men questions and women answer the women questions. We beat them worse than they had beaten us (and by a long shot). Why? The women couldn't answer their own questions at all... because NOBODY would know the answers. It was ridiculous. Don't waste your money."
2,Game Title is best thing about this thing,Got this as an Xmas gift and really looked forward to playing. Definately more fun for a GROUP OF PEOPLE (we had 7). Both men and women agreed the FEMALE QUESTIONS WERE EASIER - women didn't even know half the questions they were asking the guys. Instructions were confusing. 1st game took 5 minutes to finish. 2nd game took over an hour because we were playing wrong. We burned through over half the questions in those two games (playing wrong of course). 5 stars given for Adult Education on how to live with one another after playing.
4,it will be a fun game to play as a family,it will be a good addition to our family game nite and we will see who is the better sex
1,I didn't even want to give it one star,"we,ahead this last night with friends and it was the worst ever! the questions are stupid and it was so boring! I was expecting funny and uncomfortable questions that would make for a great evening.....not so! don't waste your money!"
2,Fun with large group,"We played this with a large group of friends (15). We didn't follow the rules, we just read the questions in turn. Keep asking men questions until they fail, then switch. One point for each right question. The group was diverse - 30 to 50+ in age. The younger players got more questions right. The older players fell into the stereo typical questions. This is really designed for an older group of adults that follow the gender rules of their society. I think the younger you are, the more you will not enjoy this game. We did have a lot of fun - but then again, we didn't follow the rules. One comment said the questions were stupid - yes, they are if you are a young adult. ""What color is the positive terminal on a car battery?"" That was for the women and I was surprised that they got it wrong - then again the leader of their group was in her late 50's. We switched to Catch Phrase - had a lot more fun."
1,One Time And You're Done,"Someone gave us this game for Christmas and we were very excited to play it. It was a lot of fun the first time through. We had 6 players. The next time we picked it up to play, we realized we had already been through all the questions. This game is grossly overpriced for what it is. It should only cost $5 for the amount of play time you get out of it!"
1,A waste of money...worst game ever,"I bought this game, and absolutely hate it. Everyone I've tried to play it with hates it. The game is based on the premise that there is men-information and women-information and that the oppostite sex probably won't know information from the other sex. What my friends and I have found that there are many questions that no one knows the answer to, regardless of sex, and there are easier questions that everyone knows the answer to. If you are looking for a fun game, this is not it. If I could find a way to return this opened game I wouldn't hesitate to do so. This game [is bad], the only reason I rated it a 4 for durability is because it will last forever because it will get no use at my house."
4,They wouldn't have won if they hadn't got Wild,"Bought this game on sale prior to Christmas and played with some friends on Game Night. I concur with others about the rules being confusing...so don't be afraid to make them user friendly by having ""house"" rules. Same song...the guys say the gals questions are easy and theirs are hard and visa versa. But if the truth be known, the guys wouldn't have won if the wild card hadn't been in their favor. Had a great time with it and next times THE GALS WILL TRIUMPH!!!"
2,50s stereotypes,"I enjoy playing pretty much all board games so you will find some enjoyment out of this BUT prepared to be frustrated. All the questions the females have to answer are about sports and tools. The questions for guys are often about fashion and cooking. I don't know a guy who doesn't cook. Maybe it is just the men I know, who watch foodtv or watched VH1s fashion show, but the men always seem to know the answers. The questions aren't balanced well from male to female. Some are just so obvious that a child could get them. And many seem to be very stereotypical of the ideals of the 50s household of husband and wife. I have only played this twice with my husband and two other couples and it was the same time each time. I would recommend Scattergories instead. That is a lot of fun!"
2,Stick with Malarky or Pictionary for a good night.,"This game is really, really, BAD...It is. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this. It assumes that men are insensitive and women are not."
1,DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS!,"My husband and I received this as a joint Christmas present. We love trivia-type games and thought this would be a fun twist. Wrong-a-rama! The questions for both male and female players were either so easy that anyone should have gotten it OR so obscure that no one could get it.If you want a challenging trivia game, buy ""Wit's End."" The questions are difficult enough to be challenging, but not obnoxiously so. If you're looking for a general trivia game, go for the old standard of Trivial Pursuit. Just don't waste your money on ""Battle of the Sexes."""
5,Great Party Game,"My wife and I had a dinner party with two other couples (one of them, we just met, so they were sort of quiet/shy). We played this game after dinner and it really broke the ice.Pitting the guys against the ladies is always sure way to get your party started---especially since the guys won!And now I know what the mother sauces are in cooking!"
3,Not about The Sexes,Just an ordinary Trivia game. Very disappointing. Not informational about the differences between men an women AS Advertised. Sorry I spent the money.
1,Blood Surf,"You have the whole movie in a nutshell from the above plot description. However, it was just plain awful! I love all types of horror movies and I will admit that I saw this one.The whole thing was just a mess. The acting was so bad that you were cheering on the croc to kill off the actors.If you want to waste some time and have to see this one I would suggest that you borrow it from someone who has it or wait for a re-run of this on the sci-fi channel. Save your $!"
1,Watch It Only For Joel West,"Joel West is a great looking and funny guy. Look for him in this movie and that's about it. The scene with him and the girl in the pool was the only thing that caught my interest. (You get to see his rear and his hot body.) Overall a boring un-original movie, if that's what you call it. For us guys the girl Joel scores with is pretty hot too."
4,Damn good,"Really good album. If you listen to Nachtmystium albums in order of release it is exciting to hear the evolution of their sound. While this album stays close to the black metal roots of this band, you can hear them experimenting and reaching for more. If you're a fan of the Reign of the Malicious period of the band this is a more ""polished"" outting, and worth checking out. If you only know Nachtmystium for their Assassins/Addicts period you owe it to yourself to hear how they have evolved. Great band. Very good album... Hail!"
2,Not quite spazz,"I heard Murder License first. The album is not all the same or different. Just a change of mood in the music. It is a bit slower than Murder. If you want faster go with Murder. This album has some nice beats to that remind me of Big Black. The way the album was engineered also. So, I would also like to recommend Big Black if you like this or vice versa."
4,The Best of John Barry,Liked the CD. It had some selections I didn't care for but it was good overall.
2,A lot of 70's Music,"If you really like 70's themes, you should like this CD. It was a little too dated for me."
5,Romantic and Funny,Great movie! Great actress. I loved the overall flick because it was amazing to follow the main actress in her life/events...
4,Lots of variety!,"If you like CCM, you'll like this CD! Similar to WOW CD's, BLUR takes 17 different artists and brings them together in one place.This CD includes Third Day, Jars of Clay, Caedmon's Call, FFH, Newsong, Shaun Groves, Chris Rice, Margaret Becker, Paul Colman Trio, Big Daddy Weave, Watermark, Kim Hill, By the Tree, Casting Crowns, Silers Bald, and Carman.""Blur, Music That Brings Focus"" is like CCM radio without commercial interruption."
4,The deeper look,"This book takes a deeper look into the Sasquatch legend. Rather than rehashing all the old stories, this book looks into the psychological, mythical, and underlying tones on the legends of creatures such as Sasquatch, Bigfoot, Wendigo, and others. This is a collection of essays from quite a number of people ranging from anthropologists to professors on mythology. There are in depths looks at perception and myth-influences as well as scientific looks at tracks, fecal matter, hair samples, and vocal recordings in relation to these creatures.If you just want some stories on sightings, this is not the book for you. If you are an avid follower, this is a prime book for research and views on thought processes and mythos influences. It doesn't answer the question if Bigfoots exist but is an excellent book on perceptions and legend creation."
5,Truly Enjoyed Reading,"This book is a welcome addition to my sasquatch research library. It is very informative and well written, with many factual details."
3,An expensive DVD for a very simple video presentation,"This is a DVD of the 2009 New Year's Concert from the Teatro La Fenice. The DVD is very simply done. The format is standard television, the sound is PCM stereo. There are no subtitles. There are no extras. The price is a bit high for this unadorned performance. However the color is solid, the camera work good, the sound acceptable and the DVD delivers a reasonable 90 minutes of light classic entertainment; a mix of orchestra and aria. The performances are solid."
1,"My 12-pack came opened, with 11 cookies in it","I received a 12 pack of Mrs Fields from Amazon (fulfilled by Lakewood Candies, LLC), slightly open at the front. Suspicious, I counted the number of cookies and realized that someone had opened up the package and pilfered one along the way...I won't make the mistake of trusting Lakewood Candies again."
4,Great but Late,"I ordered these cookies to be sent to my son who is away at school. When the cookies did arrive three weeks after they were ordered my son reports they were great, he and his friends are asking for more. The cookies were very good and they are individually wrapped so he could put them in his back pack (or hide them in his dorm room) and there was no mess. I would not order them again only because it took too long for them to arrive which is most likely Amazon's problem. The cookies were Great just too late.I will buy Mrs. Fields cookies again and send them to my son, just not through Amazon."
1,Mrs. Fields' Jumbo Individually Wrapped Chocolate Chip Cookies,See my review of the oatmeal raisin cookies I ordered from Mrs. Fields and you can use the same review for these chocolate chip ones. Don't buy these cookies; they're inedible.
4,Corny but cute,I enjoyed this book even though there were a few corny moments when I rolled my eyes a little :0) I like to read clean romances and this did not cross my invisible line so I will be looking for more books by Sylvia Andrew.
3,Fresh Concept,"From Back Of The Book:""She intrigued him...Edward Barraclough's happy bachelor existence is thrown into a spin when he is forced to look after his two orphaned nieces. Employing the right governess is vital. Miss Petrie has the girls' support, while he has reservations. Unassuming and a little dowdy she may appear, but Edward suspects she's neither so humble nor respectful underneith!Independently wealthy Lady Octavia Petrie is on the verge of confessing that Edward has mistaken her for someone else. In a moment of sheer madness, prompted by his cynical attitude, she finds herself accepting the temporary position. From Lady to simple Miss - what has she let herself in for?""I love the concept of a house approving or disapproving of individuals. This gives a very predictable storyline a twist. I liked the hero and the heroine. My only criticism is the crazy formatting throughout the book. Paragraphs floating with big spaces between them.www.BookWebWarehouse.com"
4,A Fun Good Read,"From the first couple of pages I realized this was a novel I had read before a year or two ago, but decided to read it again. I am glad I did. I love clean well written romances, so this was right up my alley. The characters were all well developed, the story line believable, and the whole package was fun to read. I found the portrayal of the house with a personality and the open possibility of the deceased previous owner's manipulations amusing. It added a nice extra touch. I give this offering by Sylvia Andrews a solid four stars."
2,"No, it doesn't really float","According to the description, this toy includes ""a raft that really floats"". The raft does not float. It takes on water and sinks. Virtually none of the other components float either. The action figures and the dolphins sink. Who ever heard of sinking dolphins? My son saved up his allowance to get these toys for his bath, and now he can't play with them in the bath. He's still looking forward to playing with them as action figures, but we're both disappointed."
3,hair & helmets fall off too easily.,This is a fun series and cheaper than play mobile. But the hair and helmets don't stay on too well. It is great for fine motor skills.
2,Small parts of the toy broke within minutes of first use,My son enjoys this toy but was very sad when within only minutes of opening the package the oar and a piece of the motor broke. He still plays with it occasionally but it was disappointing that typical use resulted in damage so quickly.
1,Terrible! Do not purchase!,"I just purchased this printer last night at BestBuy and took it home. When I removed the contents of the box, I noticed that the USB cord was not in there. I read the directions and said that you had to buy the cord separately. I couldn't believe it. So, I went to the store and bought one. This cost me an additional $11. I went home, installed the software and plugged everything in. I printed off a few things and it looked great. Today, I went to use the printer again and the power woudn't turn on! I disconnected then reconnected everything and still no power! I tried several more things and still couldn't turn the power on. Now I have to return it to BestBuy. This was the first and last time I will ever buy anything from HP!!!"
1,"MAC users, get your wallet ready.","Functionally, this printer works. Print quality is very good.HERE's the issue. There is no way to adjust print quality when using a MAC. I use this same exact printer on both my MAC and my PC. With the PC I've got a bunch of options to adjust to ""fast draft"", so that I can save money printing. With the MAC drivers HP has included there is no such option. So each time you print, you are using maximum ink!!!!VERY costly to run. Cartridges are expensive and I go through a lot of them. Time to switch printers -- this one just isn't good for MACOcassionaly there are problems printing photos using my PC -- lots of colored lines through the photo. Nothing seems to fix that, but when I print from iPhoto with the MAC, it doesn't happen.So there you go -- works perfectly with MAC, but insanely expensive. Problematic photo printing with Windows XP SP2, but cheaper to operate. Great combination!"
1,"Unreliable, same jam problems as mentioned","I purchased a C4180 in late 2006, the printer was very easy to set up and I loved the features. Soon it started having feed problems however, and eventually quit working altogether. A call to HP yielded fast and courteous service, I was impressed with how they handled a replacement. Got the new printer, and it worked fine for awhile then started misfeeding and giving the carriage jam errors that have been mentioned here. They want $35 to service the printer as a one time fee, but it is starting to look as there is an inherent design flaw in this model and i'm just going to find another one. The features and performance of this printer would have yielded a 4 or 5 star rating from me, but alas it's worthless if it will not do something as simple as feed a sheet of paper."
2,Ok in the beginning....but after a year it jams on photo paper,"I have to say I had been pretty happy with this printer. I used it for the past two years pretty heavy while working on my Master's Degree, however, now it continues to jam with any type of cardstock or photo paper. Just a warning to anyone who may wish to print with heavier paper types...don't buy this printer."
1,BLOATWARE EVERYWHERE,"Disgustingly filled with bloatware. I couldn't even locate my scanned photos or set my preferences so I could find them in my files.Huge driver package filled with useless crap. Can't say anything about the print quality because I didn't print with it, the softwarewas too much of a pain in the ass to use."
3,Good quality print but terrible paper feed!,"The quality of the print is fantastic, even printed some great photos with it. But my serious complaint is that the printer will consistently pull in multiple pages at once during a print operation. Which means I can never trust it to accurately print everything, sometimes after a 10 page document is printed, I will find there are actually 15 pages there and those 5 extra pages were all pulled in at once and printed on portions of the paper as they were pulled through the paper feeder. Unless I can somehow find out how to resolve this, I would not recommend this printer. I find out of 10 print jobs I complete, I have to redo at least 6 of them because the paper feeder has pulled in more than one sheet at a time."
1,Walk on By !!!.. heck RUN !,"I purchased this printer 3 years ago and it has been NOTHING but trouble.It probably is part of the class action suite against HP ... who knows ??All I know is unless you use a printer every day don't buy this one.It constantly quits printing or gives error message, even though there is ink in it.It also won't let you print in B/W if there is no color ink.Had I known how rotten this printer was going to be I never would have purchased it.Dummy me for listening to the Best Buy guy !!!"
2,Disappointed in C4180,"This printer was part of a package deal with a Compaq Presario that I purchased two years ago. When I got it home, there was no CD for installing it with Vista. After many calls to unknown geographical areas, they finally consented to sending me the disc.I print regularly, but not often, and I have only needed to change cartridges twice. I have not done any photos, never used the scan and only made a few copies last tax season. However, it now says that it is ""out of paper"", but it is not. I have had the ""online chat"", and completed all the steps on HP website for fixing this problem. Still, same problem.Can't believe anyone would pay this much for this machine. Two years of moderate use does not justify the price-tag."
3,OK Printer Except for Lousy 4x6 Print Tray.,"I have been running a C4150 for two years. For the price it isa good enough printer. I print off of a Mac OSX, an XP and aVista computer. So that's a pretty good test. One gripe though.The 4x6 print tray really sucks. It always jams. I have gottentired of fixes. Looking around the Web, it looks like I am notthe only one who can't print 4x6's. How can they release a productthat performs like this?"
2,Works great after a year BUT!!!!!!!!,"This is a nice printer. I have had it since Dec 2006. It scans well and prints well. The pictures that I have printed are great--especially using HP paper. So why do I rate this as a 2 star? Because of the ink cartridge. They are less expensive. A black cartridge will run you $14, the color maybe $17. Sounds great, right? Wrong--there is only 5 ml of ink in the cartridges. Folks that is a teaspoon worth of ink! We go through cartridges like Sherman went through Atlanta. As soon as I can I'm getting another printer."
2,Does a good job when it works,"I have owned this printer for about two years. It's ""draft mode"" prints very quickly, its ""high quality mode"" creats great looking documents but if I ever try to print more than 25 pages in one sitting it jams up. This isn't a paper jam or something that can be easily fixed, the carriage stops working. The only way to clear the jam is to unplug it and plug it back in, which means you lose the rest of your document and have to start over. Just turning it off doesn't work, it still thinks their is a jam."
2,Okay for Pictures,"This system is for pictures...it does not do a good job of scanning documents to your computer and sending them as an attachment. It has limited use and there are far better document printers out there in the market. However, it seems mediocre for pictures which should be its speciality."
2,Expensive to use,"While the printer is good as a multipurpose office item, the cost of the cartridges is very high and they don't last long at all. I was spoiled by my laserjet. I won't buy one of these again as HP overcharges for the ink you need to use it. Not a good purchase on my part"
2,"Good print quality, easy, aggravating paper feed issues","This printer couldn't be easier to set up and use and the print quality is good. However, I echo frustrations others here have had with the paper feed. It frequently feeds more than one sheet, which wastes paper and time as you have to print over and over until the thing gets it right. Photo paper is even worse in this regard. If I had it to do over again, I'd buy something else."
2,Nice features but labor intensive to print anything.,"This printer is nice and has lots of features but I am constantly trying to clear carriage jams and mis fed paper to get it to print. We use the printer about once a week to just print a few pages. I often need to play with the printer for about 5 or 10 minutes just to get it to print a few pages. We have used new fresh paper, etc but nothing seems to work. This is a great printer if you really enjoy playing with stuff to make it work. I would have just given it one star but this printer is loaded with features and is at a nice price."
1,Incompatible with Windows Vista,"After many problems with this printer I just threw it away. I had a heckuva time getting it to work with Windows Vista, then when it did work it did so reluctantly, quirkily and unreliably. Also, the software that came with the printer seemed to slow down the computer's workings, as though there was always something going on behind the scenes. It didn't work well with Windows XP either. I think the software was the main problem. It seemed to be a massive file, which required quite some time to delete from both of my computers."
5,Wonderful little printer...,"I brought this printer a couple months ago. Some of these negative reviews made me nervous to buy it...but I found that I really like this printer. It's light, reliable, and prints great quality pictures and papers at home. I would not recommend this printer for heavy use though."
2,disposable,"It was sad. We puchased this printer from HP about eight months ago for more than $200. It is about half that price now. It stopped working a couple weeks ago. HP sent a (refurbished) replacement. It does'nt work either. The next replacement is on the way however after several hours of speaking with people from HP who have very heavy accents, as well as paying shipping cost for three printers I am very dissapointed."
3,Printer Review,I find this printer to be extremely noisy and the print cartridges keep getting jammed.
4,Worth the Money,These are nice wood puzzles. My 3-year-old can do them on her own. She likes the box and puts them away in their individual boxes. Very fun.
5,great puzzle,"Our 3 1/2 yr old doesn't get to play with this puzzle very often because we have smaller children around that will eat the pieces. When we do get it out, it seems to hold her interest as long as we do it with her. Good challenging puzzle for her. We hope to see some progression on her ability to do it by herself."
1,Too small and difficult to organize,"Now granted I should have taken out a tape measurer and figured out the actual size of this box of puzzles before I ordered it as I am bad at spatial understanding. However, when this box of puzzles came and was so small with tiny pieces, it was useless to my 3 year old. It's very compact and conveinient to tote around with you if you have an older child it might work out but for us it was just too small with too many little pieces to be any use to us."
2,Poor quality - not typical Melissa and Doug product,"Poorly constructed from the box, which was warped so that the top was difficult to remove, to the pieces themselves, which barely fit together. Splintered as pieces were pushed together. Frustrating and not fun for parent or child."
4,Good puzzle,This is a great puzzle. You have four different puzzles in one. The back of the puzzle pieces are marked with a different shape so they won't all get mixed up.
2,Disappointed,"I usually love Melissa and Doug puzzles, but this one was missing a piece when it arrived. Also, the wood on a few pieces splintered. If not for those two issues, this would be a great toy. We have the Melissa & Doug Deluxe Zoo in a Box Jigsaw Puzzles, and our twin 1.5 year olds really like it."
2,Damaged Goods,Book arrived with torn cover despite the packaging intact. This unacceptable for a product listed as new.
5,the commentary disc is incredible,"So -- let's talk about the ""extra"" disc containing Zander's commentary on Mahler's 9th. This disc, with its intricate care and crafting (imagine how long it took the authors to splice it all together), is quite a gem. There's nothing like it in any of the other hundreds of classical CDs that I own. I've listened to Mahler's 9th symphony at least fifty times, but Zander's disc opened up new listening ideas for me. For someone else who is new to Mahler, this explanatory disc could mean the difference between enthusiastically entering the world of Mahler, versus merely dismissing Mahler as frustratingly difficult. The commentary disc even on its own is something very special, and I hope it shows lots and lots of people the pathway to one of the greatest composers of all time."
3,"Disappointing story, fun puzzle","I've been a fan of mystery puzzles for years. Although assembling the jigsaw puzzle is entertaining, the story itself, particularly its resolution, is very disappointing.If you are looking for any sort of a satisfying mystery, you will be let down. If you are looking for a fun jigsaw to pass a few hours, you will be quite satisfied. It's just a shame that the strength between the mystery and the jigsaw puzzle couldn't have been more balanced."
1,The resoultion to this puzzle was unacceptable,"The puzzle was good and the story was entertaining. The solution was a BIG disappointment. I don't want to write a spoiler, but please don't expect an ending that makes sense."
1,Broken Toy - Broken Heart,"Purchased two of these for my grandson, and would have purchased the entire set. Weapons did not fit hands of figures, and the hands fell out of the sockets, and, of course, they're now missing. The figure did not even last 24 hours. Flawed design and poor construction. I won't purchase any more Bandai toys, and the ones I purchased for Christmas are being returned."
1,Too many flaws to make up for it's versatility.,"We received this item as a gift for my 2 year-old daughter and I agree with the other reviews. The item seems great because of its versatility but there are so many negatives to this toy, that I would not recommend it. The wheels don't roll - they often get stuck so my toddler has difficulty pushing it around and the engineering of converting stroller to grocery cart is flimsy and often the front tabs of the bottom basket come off the rods to just dangle to the floor and the same happens to the bottom front of the stroller - it often doesn't stay put on the rods to form the stroller seat so it turns into more of a pouch than a seat. All in all, I would pass on this one - too many flaws for the versatility."
1,You get what you pay for...,Not too much fun and breaks too easily. My daughter uses her real umbrella stroller more I'm just going to toss it since it's broken :/
1,Wheels don't work!!,"I wouldn't buy this again. It is cute but a major pain to convert, and even when you get it converted the wheels don't work! They get stuck and my children get frustrated. Buy something else!"
2,"Easy to maneuver, cheesy as a stroller","Daughter rec'd this for 3rd birthday and lost interest when it didn't work as supposed to, but her younger sister still uses it to push around, even as poorly designed as it is. The pink side supports that hold it up as a shopping basket broke fairly quickly after normal use. Doesn't have much support for doll to sit up. The baby carrier doesn't support a doll and velcro doesn't stay on my daughters very well, but they still attempt to use it. We've ended up buying a sturdier Chicco one that will last much longer. If you want a shopping basket, get the Little Tykes (or Fisher Price?) shopping cart. At least it'll hold up until they outgrow it and you can pass along or sell to someone else."
4,Great toddler toy!,This was a pleasant surprise. Very fun for our 18 month girl. Easy to assemble and very affordable for what you get! I only wish it was slightly more durable. Even fun for our 8 year old daughter who still loves playing with babydolls.
1,The price says it all. Cheap Cheap Cheap!!,Do not waste your money on this stroller. It is a real pain to but together and when you do finally get it whole the wheels do not spin very well. My daughter tries to push it but the wheel turn backwards and then don't go anywhere. Very frustrating for her. It is basically a hunk of junk in my house. Spend the extra $ and get a better quality stroller.
3,Cute but not made well for little ones,"I bought this for my 2 l/2 year old granddaughter. I bought it because it was very cute and versatile, converting from a stroller into a grocery cart. However, we found it to be much too flimsy for the way a toddler plays. It was also very frustrating for her because the wheels would not roll properly."
2,Different,"This item came to me right away, so it ships out pretty fast.This pillow is different from anything else you will ever try. So with that being said some people may love it, while some others may not.Should this pillow break open small beads will go everywhere and you must be careful if you have young children or animals that might try to play with or eat these pieces."
3,"""An Enjoyable Read""","I do like the concept. A carrier submarine taking on a race of undersea aliens who apparently are responsible for the disappearance of several American citizens in a small Pacific country. One thing I did like about the story is we really didn't know much about the aliens. We always saw them through the eyes of the Shenandoah crew, who had to make some calculated guess on how these creatures operate. Not as much action as I expected, but the story was handled pretty well. I did have a problem with Stine's overuse of exclamation points. 55% of normal conversations ended with these marks, making it appear the characters were constantly shouting at each other."
3,Getting gyped by a Christian? Why am I not suprised.,"I am a Christian, and am trying to get published, and bought this simultaneous with the secular 2007 Writer's Market (back in Fall of 2007) which is outstanding. One has to expect new small publishers to go out of business, but I believe I discovered too many way-out-of-date references in the ""Christian Writers' Market"", publishers that had been out of business longer than 9 months. Does Sally E. Stuart work for a living or does she just keep redistribuing the same tired old volume with a new date on it?"
5,Necessary resource for Christian writers,"Every Christian writer who is serious about the business of writing needs to own this book. This year, a CD of the entire book is included with the hard copy - makes searching very easy."
2,What is up with this book?,"Okay, I have read all of the Charmed books and this is by far the worst one yet. On the very first page i noticed an error. The author said that Phoebe's fiance was named Cole Porter not Cole Turner and all the Charmed viewers should know that cole's name is not Cole Porter! Then later on in the book the author talks about phoebe throwing energy balls...but that, like most of us know, is an upper level demonic power. I just wanted to point this out to some people and this is a nice place to do it. I thought this was a good book despite these errors. But still the writer should look into what she is writing next time! Thank you."
1,So not Charmed,"has carla jablonski ever even seen the show charmed?! she would know that they cant throw energy balls. This really really bugged me when i was reading it! plus the characters seemed really unlike themselves. It also had an old story plot going on- that paige felt bad compared to prue, and piper still couldnt accept paige. this was settled last year! before she writes another book, maybe carla should actually watch the show!"
3,what!!!!,this book has to many mistake to count pheobe and paige throwing energy balls cole still having powers? if your a big fan of the show this book will just annoy you with the amounts of faults in it. even if your not a fan and you just wanted to try it out there are much better charmed books out there
2,what is up with this book?,"Okay what is up with this book? It was the worst of the charmed books that I have read.First off how come Phoebe can throw energy balls and Paige trying to when she's in cat form. The last time I checked Phoebe could only levetate and she had premonisions, and Paige could orb and have stuff orb to her.Seconded of all whats up with Paige still thinking that she is in the shadow of Prue? In the show she got over it along time of go.Third the book would be okay if there wasn't so many holes in the story. Like why can Tyler tap into Paiges power?Need less to say is is probably one of the worst Charmed books that i have read."
1,Dissapointed,"I am a huge fan of charmed and of the books. I am proud to say I have read all of them, but sorry to say this one was the worst. I understand that the books are based on the T.V. show and not exactly the same, but my god Cole Porter??? perhaps the author couldn't make the story run smoothly if they didn't shoot fireballs? Thats the whole point of them having specific powers, so they have to make it interesting.I also saw alot of typos like when one sister was supposed to say something but it had ""Paige said"" but it really as someone else. I also think that the book was way to descriptive and hard to get through.I would however recommend the book to a fan, because maybe you'll like it. Read it and decide for ur self, but don't let ur expectations get too high."
1,The worst of all novels,The storyline was okay..but man...all the facts of the Charmed Ones have been twisted almost completely!!! The Charmed Ones don't shoot energy balls from their palms..especially Piper and Paige.Paige can only calls others energy balls and reflected back not shoot her own one.And what's wrong with Cole's name..Porter instead or Turner?Hmmm..weird..I suggest that the author and the editor watch Charmed thoroughly next time before start writing and publishing another twisted Charmed novel coz' it's frustrating to read such a novel for a Charmed fan like me.
2,A Feast for Conspiracy Lovers,"I would rate this book 5 stars for entertainment value and 2 stars for accuracy. Marvelous presentation of 'facts' and/or unverifiable data that can be misleading. A nice try, but no cigar, although it is great to see that the revisionists are still hard at work, grinding out conspiracy theories and demonizing the dead."
2,Doesnt really make sense.,"I guess for all those conspiracy theorists out there, this is a good book. To say that FDR wanted Pearl Harbor to happen for the US to enter the war on the side of England is ridiculous. Japan did not have any signed treaty, let alone a handshake with the Axis powers. The real question is why Hitler decided 3 days later to declare war against the US, the answer to that is still unknown; Hitler may have figured since the US was fighting Japan he could fight the US as part of his world conquest. But still, the Japanese do not call it WWII, the call it the Great Pacific War, and look at the war in Europe as something different, which it was. There is absolutely no connection between Pearl Harbor and the US going to war with Germany, that's why this book doesn't really make sense."
1,Thorough,"Complex politics requires scholars to unravel the truth from the fictions.This does that job brilliantly leaving little doubt, it all happened as reported."
2,Nonsense,"Does anyone use plain ole common sense anymore? Are we really to believe that the president of the United States would deliberately let thousands of Americans be killed, let half of our Pacific Fleet be crippled, and leave the west coast of America open to attack, all for the sake of winning support for a war that we would eventually be dragged into anyway? And this from a president that loved the Navy? What a bunch of hogwash. There is no doubt many things things about Pearl Harbor have been left out of history, but c'mon folks, use your brains.."
1,No need to proceed,"I'm probably at fault here, but within the first chapter, the author stated his premise and somewhat backed it up. I believed it, accepted it, understood why it transpired, read the appendices and didn't feel particularly compelled to read on. Probably my loss."
4,PRELIMINARY COMMENTS TO MY LATER REVIEW,"Prior to reading this book, one should read Infamy by John Toland, The Codebreakers by David Kahn, The book by Stephanson who was the British intelligence liaison to FDR and any number of books about Pearl Harbor which clearly indicated the confusion in the minds of Adm.Kimmel and Gen.Short concerning how to interpret the orders they were receiving from Washington HQ. Also, since I am an electrical Engineer and a trained communications and RADAR specialist, I look forward to reading this book. I entered the navy in Feb '43 and served in the Pacific as a CIC watch officer for a Destroyer Squadron I will use my crypto experience too.Note also that I just saw a lecture on C-SPAN II by the author of this book and he does not appear to be prepared to discuss all aspects of the subject due to a lack of various technical expertise in many areas."
4,"[Really three-and-a-half out of Four stars] The true story, along w/ G. Morgenstern's book, of how to bail the Brits out (again!","Mr Stinnett proves our worst military disasterever in our country's history is no accident!Pearl Harbour was certainly not Mr(s) Kimmelor Short's fault(s), so why does that 90I.Q.idiot presently @ 1600 Penn. Avg. not exoneratethem!? There was plenty of proof of plenty ofevidence that passed over the Masonic clownFDR's desk to prove the japs., were about tobomb Pearl Harbour! Read for yourself Mrand Mrs America. The price is right!"
1,Fantasy Island,"This books makes the Kennedy conspiracy look authentic. No mention of the carriers worthwhile, no mention of derilection of duty by ship commanders who were under under of alert which meant all ammunition should not have been locked. This books is more aimed at sourpuss Republicans who won't acknowledge FDR and the terrible crime of unpreparedness they put the country in. If you want to read a unbiased and great book on Pearl Harbor read ""A Long Days Journey into War"""
2,Too outlandish,"Sorry, but I can't buy that the US would intentionally wipe out its Naval and Air Forces in the Pacific to angle itself into the war.You might be interested to know that in Japan this book is cited in a major newspaper as ""proof"" that the US ""tricked"" Japan into attacking Pearl Harbor. I'll bet the author didn't intend that feat of revision. The cult of victimhood continues..."
5,Day of Deceit should read Years of Deceit,"Day of Deceit is a well documented account of the Roosevelt administration's efforts to provoke the Japanese into attacking the US to have an excuse to enter the war against Germany. No progressive democrat or reactionary republican can give this text an honest reading without coming to the conclusion that the Roosevelt administration, rather than being a reluctant entrant into the war, was an enthusiastic and very active provocateur.If the propositions of this text were not true, no WWII archives would still be secret."
5,A pretext for war; Pearl Harbor,"Why would the US government need to keep military documents from Congress and the American people if `they' had nothing to hide from us? Mr. Stinnett provides these military documents to support his conclusion.This book examines:""1 - The US Navy's eight point Overt Act of War strategy adopted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that lured Japan to attack Pearl Harbor.2 - The 1941 Japanese naval radio intercepts.3 - Presidential and U.S. Army and Naval dispatches ordering American Pacific commanders to stand aside and let Japan commit the first overt act of war.4 - Discover six years of Pearl Harbor hoaxes intended to deceive the American public and congress.Follow the Japanese naval spy who was allowed carte blanche to spy on and prepare bomb plots of Pearl Harbor.""The McCollum Memo alone provides evidence that this was no surprise attack; well no surprise to the higher levels of the US government and military."
4,amazing,"If this story is true, then we as Americans should be shocked. To let an enemy knowingly attack is crazy, just to start a war. Well, maybe not so crazy and sounds all to familiar. All wars are like this."
1,A very dishonest author,"Stinnett widely misrepresents hundreds of his documents Earlier this year he had to shut down his OWN message board at his website because of MANY angry readers demanding answers for his sloppy research. The biggest 3 mistakes are, 1 misrepresenting the McCollum document, also Stinnett imcorrectly states that McCollum's office was as ""an element of Station US (by which he means OP-20-G), a secret American cryptographic center located at the main naval headquarters"" in an poor effort to tie McCollum closer to OP-20-G before WWII.Second, he lumped both the simple code JN-25A that was in effect until 1 Dec 1940 with the a much more complicated code JN-25B a code that provided no significant decrypts until early 1942. And third he makes the mistake about radio silence. The Japanese never did transmit. The sworn statements of 11 Japanese officers, diaries of a DD XO and the official BatDiv 3 and CarDiv 5 logs that all agree to this well known fact."
1,Marshall warned both Admiral Kimmel and General Short,"It is well known that ten days before the attack on Pearl Harbor took place that Marshall sent a message to both Kimmel and Short warning them to prepare for an attack.Unfortunately,both Kimmel and Short interpreted this to mean that a sabotage attack by potential infiltrators was eminent.Kimmel's response was to send the carriers out of Pearl Harbor while simultaneously grouping all of the battleships as close as possible so as to guard them against a sabotage attack.Short did precisely the same thing with respect to his air force.All the planes were placed wing tip to wing tip so as to guard them against a sabotage attack.I guess that both Kimmel and Short had forgotten General Billy Mitchell's prediction made back in 1924 that the Japanese would one day attack Pearl Harbor using carrier based torpedo bombers at 7:00 A M on a Sunday morning.This book is very incomplete and should never have been published with out extensive revisions."
3,FDR played Japan like a vituoso.,"That the president had fore knowledge of Japan's attack has been an open secret for many years. Mr. Stinnett leaves no doubt. FDR may have not been prepared for the magnitude of the Pearl attack. He may even have felt that only Guam, Wake the Phillipines & ships at sea would be attacked, but he knew. With85% of Americans opposed to war, Japan had to fire the first shots. Germany played her part too by declaring war on us first. Germany was after all FDR's primary target.Of special interest & the heart of the book (tape) were the eight points authored by LtCdr. Arthur McCollum. These were recommendations of actions to be followed to provoke Japan into war, It is unclear that FDR actually saw them but everyone of the eight points was followed. That is the real story of this book. Rafael Ferrer is a fine dramatic reader."
4,What is the truth?,This is a well documented history of events leading up to Pearl Harbor which gives a lot of credibility to FDR manipulating events to pull the US into WWII. I will try to find out how Mr. Stinnett is viewed by other noted WWII historians. This book presents a different light on FDR than I have heard before and I wonder if this view and Mr. Stinnett are credible rather than having an agenda to prove. It is well written and an easy read for the most part. It certainly caught my attention as it should anyone that has an interest in FDR's legacy and how his administration operated prior to WWII.
5,Day Of Deceit,"I found the book to be extremely interesting and informative. It certainly sheds a new light on the history of our involvement in World War II. Also, it makes you wonder how the political stage may have influenced other major developements in the past and how they may determine history in the future."
5,Loved It,I loved the fact that the book was in good shape (New as specified) when I received it and it also came on time as specified in the estimated delivery date. To me that was an excellent service right there.
2,"Good for high school students, bad for experienced thinkers.","I returned this book. However, I am a voracious reader of history and appreciate specifically history that is framed to present periods and events with meaning and drama. Great writers of history can capture these elements in the topcs they cover via a combination of skill, enthusiasm and knowledge. This book does not rise to that level. Perhaps the authors did not intend it to.Good book for a basic introduction to Black folks' history but not sufficient to satisfy the appetites of experienced, critical lay-thinkers."
1,"Oh, Please","This book should have been in the Fantasy section. Franklin wrote this book without much research or he belongs to the revisionist history class. Take away his false statements and attempt at reaching ""white guilt"" and this book would have been about ten pages long."
3,The adapter was good.,The cassette adapter is very helpful in playing songs from iphones & mobiles.The audio clarity also same as hearing from the iphone/ipod.
2,wouldn't bother,Nothing wrong with the vendor's response; the unit was sent properly. My gripe is with the unit. It does what you don't want.....causes the cassette player to reverse frequently.AND the brand name on the link is misleading. The unit has CE marked on it....NOT GE!!!
3,Works well for the price,"This cassette tape adapter works well. Sound is crystal clear with no static or background fuzz. My only complaint is that the bass tones do not come through as well as the treble sounds. I can fix this with a few adjustments to my stereo, but it is a pain to adjust the bass each time I switch from radio to tape deck. But overall, this products works very well, especially for the price. I've paid more for other cassette tape adapters with a lot worse sound."
2,Adapter,"This adapter is just not dependable. On some days it works, on other days is doesn't. It was inexpensive, however."
3,ejects after time,"worked fine for a while. on a recent trip up to Tahoe, the adapter ejected by itself, & I couldn't get it to play again."
4,This worked really well in the car,until something happened to the system.It still works great in the portable radio we have.Would definitely buy again!
2,purchase,"The seller was great, item was very poor quality. The sound was terrible and crackly ended up having to buy another later to replace this one"
1,you probably shouldn't buy this...,"Well.. basically, i bought this adapter, hoping to be able to pop this into the cassette player in my 1990's Chevrolet S-10, and enjoy the music on my iPod 4G. but.. The performance was disappointing. It ""worked"", but the sound quality was sh*t, and the music was only coming out of the left-side speakers. I also tried it on my friends 2000 dodge stratus, same results. My recommendation- do. not. waste. your. money. on. this. product."
1,Does not work,"I purchased this one to replace the maxwell brand one I first owned and it does not work. It switches back and forth like the tape needs to be flipped. The music plays but it cuts out every 3 seconds as the cassette tries to ""flip""."
1,Poor quality,It sounded bad. I bought one made by Monster. The thing made a lot of racket in the tape player.
4,It works fine,I bought this to use it with my car and it works fine. The price and quality of it is great!
5,BOSSSSS,"I had a $90 FM transmitter and it sounded terrible even with my brand new pioneer speakers (6) I would always get static and it sounded lower, purchased this and it's got a crisp clean high sound, no static what do ever. Best sound you will find via transmitter!!"
1,Not worth the price of shipping,"If this is a GE product, they sure aren't very proud of it. There are no GE or brand markings on the cassete, and no printing of any sort on the packaging.Has a cheap, tinny sound with an ipod that none of the EQ settings can overcome. Makes a loud clacking sound in 1 of my cars. After a month it lost 90% of the sound on the left side. My 18 year old sony adapter from my diskman still works brilliantly in both vehicles--so I know there are much better options out there."
2,A lot is static,The unit does not work well in my Lexus cassette player. Experience a lot of static and other noises. Would not recommend it.
3,Second one worked,The first one they sent me didn't work at all. But the customer service was great and they sent out a new one to me and didn't even charge me for it. The newer one works well.
1,Horrible.,"Poor quality, moving the cord a bit makes loud static noises. Had trouble at first, the tape would auto-eject. I had to open up the tape and fix the problem. It stopped working and when I e-mailed the seller, they told me I might have ""interference"" problems. They did not instruct me on how to fix it. It's not worth sending it back to them."
1,Awful!!!,I bought the cassette adaptor for my car and its is worthless. Don't both buying it. I feel terribly sending in a bad review but I wouldn't want someone buying this. My cassette make a loud clicking noise louder than the music playing. It also stops working for time periods... I am not sure if mine is just a defected one because there are also good review for this product :((( ?! I don't know
1,GE iPod Cassette Adapter,I was very disappointed in this product because it would not work with my iPod. It just continuously tripped my player backwards and forwards.
5,for less than a buck,it works perfect and it's cheap and it works. Store prices are high for a cassette crazy. To buy one for 15$ or more
1,Doesn't work...,"When I got my first cassette, I put it in my car's cassette player. I hear some scratching noise and my cassette player spits it right out. I try this a couple more times without success, and so I contacted the seller for a replacement. They were pretty good about it and sent me a replacement, but that one ended up like the first one. Point is, the thing doesn't work so buy at your own risk."
1,garbage,"Well, after reading some rather positive reviews on this product, I thought I'd give it a try. I mean, it's what... $6 after shipping? Pretty darn cheap. And surprisingly, as far as the sound quality goes, it is great, much better than the $20 cassette adapter I bought at Best Buy years ago. Unfortunately the diameter of the male end headphone plug is too narrow. It freely spins around in my ipod, and the tiniest budge causes all sorts of static and often cuts the sound out of the left side of my car. On top of that, a while back I had dropped my ipod right on the headphone jack, which actually made the hole tighter, so any other pair of headphones I've used is difficult to put in the ipod.Consensus: Don't buy this product, spend an extra dollar on something better."
4,Great Product regardless of cheap price,"Great little device, no need to get an expensive stereo with auxiliary in when you can just get this thing and have yourself an auxiliary input! When I stuck it into my car's stereo, and pressed play and turned some music on music on, the quality was pretty darn good, no complaints there.-1 star because when I stuck it in, and turned down the sound completely. I hear a very very small clicking noise each time the cassette is constantly rolling. Not sure if mine was just defective or if this is typical of these adapters, but I don't like the clicking noise. It maybe just defective, i'd imagine at 35 cents quality control on these things is probably close to none! However, when I do play music I cannot hear the clicking noise, so that's why only -1 star. Hopefully that noise isn't a sign of this thing breaking down in the future, but at $3 including shipping I'll just buy another one!"
1,didnt work,The tape kept popping out of the tape player. Was very disappointed. Good thing it was cheap or I would have been really mad.
1,Fake Product (not GE),The seller shows the original GE Cassette Adapter in the photos but the actual product sent is a Chinese duplicate. The product is of very inferior quality and produces a lot of noises while playing music. The quality of music is very poor and you can't hear the voice clearly. I have given lot of request to refund the product but the seller is not responding. The item takes 5-6 working days to arrive even when it's shipped from US.
2,different product shipped,"i ordered two of these last year and they were perfect , they didnt make any strange sounds and they were unmarked ...like they didnt have a brand name on them. well my cat chewed the cords on my other ones and decided to buy one this time around. and OMG this this is hell it keeps making a clicking sound i didnt notice it until i turned the volume down to answer a phone call and i kept hearing this repeated clicking sound. its extremely annoying but then again i only hear it when the volume is low -____-"
1,Does not work,"Product does not work. At all. Connected to an Ipod, and no sound, nothing. Do not buy this product, it is possible that it does, as labeled, work with a portable cd player, but it most certainly does not function with an Ipod."
3,Good Enough,"Amazon definitely offers it at a price less than what Walmart has priced it at..And hence the obvious option. And this one works great. Just that at higher volumes the sounds cracks up a little.. But otherwise, its doing a great job"
1,super cheap,from the moment i took it out of the package I had to wiggle the wires to get it to work properly! worthless piece of junk!
1,Buyer beware! These are not the original recordings.,"They are instead new recordings by the original artists. NOT the same! I bought this CD because I liked several of the songs on it, but now I will have to continue to look for them in other collections."
2,One Hit Wonders?,"If you're gonna release a compilation titled ""One Hit Wonders"" you'd better make sure the artists actually had only ONE HIT!The Ozark Mountain Daredevils not only released ""Jackie Blue"" but also hit the charts with ""If You Wanna Get To Heaven.""Likewise, the Grass Roots had MANY hits ... ""Lets Live For Today, Midnight Confessions, Sooner Or Later, Temptation Eyes, Two Divided By Love, and Wait A Million Years.""Bottomline: The tunes on this disc get good marks (4 stars)! However, the producers need some remedial training on the definition of ""One Hit Wonders"" (subtract 2 stars).Pat"
2,"No, not original but some tracks are interesting to hear","Like Skysgt said, the title One Hit Wonders isn't apropo to some of the artists here. And, like the other reviewer said, these are re-reoordings (and two are live versions...Billy Paul & Ozark Mtn. Daredevils). I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you're a completist and want to have some newer recordings of these old hits, and that would probably be mostly for curiousity/novelty value. If you've seen a TV show with nostalgia acts performing their old hits, that should give you some idea of what you'll get on this collection."
4,Worth finding a used copy of this book,"I ordered a used copy based on the reviews I read here. I like fantasy by women authors that feature a female POV, and this book did not dissappoint. I agree with other reviewers that the book meandered a bit towards the middle. But overall a pleasant read. Has some graphic sexual descriptions, that I did not think were absoluteley necessary. I have ordered the two sequels and I am now waiting to continue the series."
4,Romance and suspense!,"This book is filled with romance when Dion meets the beautiful Andre. Dion can't make up her mind about this gorgeous hunk but others would be delighted to take her place. Suspense filled to see what happens at the end. This book was a great read and filled with one surprise after another! People who like mysterious circumstances and/or romance will find this book worthwhile, I think."
5,My son loves these toys,"My 9 year old son really loves the entire Ugly Doll franchise. The dolls are well made and stand up to some fairly rigorous playing, yet they go through the washer without a problem. Plus it doubles as a pillow in the car. I highly recommend them."
5,"It's the best recording of the ""Dances"" you can find",This is the best recording of the Slovanic Dances I've ever heard. Levi really brings out the dramatic and keeps the playful light at the same time. I strongly recommend this recording to everyone to add to their music library. It is a well rounded and well played recording by a real up and coming symphony.
3,A heavenly read!,"Zapped is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read! Marianne Thompson tells us the story of how she had prayed for Mr. Right to come along and, as if sent right from heaven, she meets the man of her dreams. Throughout the book, Thompson describes the inexplicable occurrences that take place after she makes the aforementioned plea. She tells her story with a great deal of wit and insight. Despite Thompson's intelligence, the dialogue could use some improvement. Other than that, Zapped is a wonderful and endearing book. It has elements of divine power, but not offensively so, which means that everyone, including skeptics, could enjoy this gem. A great read..."
1,Superfluous,"SuperfluousAlthough I was at first intrigued by this book, I was very disappointed upon completion. There was a lot less Zapped or any talk about spirituality and a lot more monotonous details about where she went, what she ate, and whom she was with. Details that were completely unnecessary to the plot, theme or action of the book. At times I thought she took passages directly from her journals, which should have been edited out. Great idea, not so great execution."
2,Typically Dry Lattimore...,"Although I admire Lattimore as a great classical scholar, I don't admire his translations very much. This is another typically dry and tired and monotonous rendering of Pindar Odes. Try the oxford translation by Anthony Verity for a unparalleled comparison."
3,"Ok, but noisy.","I don't use this anymore because it makes my cowbell rattle when i hit the bass drum, and that gets annoying. I ended up using an old speaker stand to mount my cowbell on. But when i did use it it was good and sturdy."
5,"Finally, an effective tool for disicplemaking","After years of various approaches to disicplemaking, I was so excited to first read Greg Ogden's ""Transforming Discipleship"" which then led me to this work, ""Discipleship Essentials,"" a 24 week curriculum for disciplemaking. Our church is using it in groups of three or four who upon completion prayerfully enlist their own ""triad"" to go through the material with. It can take as long as a year, but for the first time we are seeing genuine multiplication take place. Get both books and get started today!"
5,Great Book!!!,This is an excellent book if used correctly. When you apply everything that the books says to your life it will change things for the positive. It is a realistic approach to evangelism that really works.
5,Love the book,"Our church is reading and working very hard on this book at the time of this review. I find just the opening pages is a very good description of where the church is to-day. It is my hope and prayer that this book will change me and the group that im in, to glorify God through Jesus my Lord. AmenThis book is a homerun"
3,Discipleship EssentialsA: A Guide to Building Your Life in Christ,Book was more intense and detailed than I expected. I am looking for a group study and this may have too much work on the student portion.
5,Used this book and passed the test,"This book is just like other Kalani's books!By reading it a couple of times during 2 months, I passed the exam easily!Would like to recommend to those who are preparing for the 70-316 test!"
2,Not helpful,"Disappointing. I was hoping this book would be useful to refresh my mind of the specific types of items that would be on the exam. Unfortunately, it serves better as a reference book. It contains much more information than is covered on the exam, and yet does not go into sufficient detail to explain the topics. The practice exam on the enclosed CDROM is klunky and most of the questions are much harder than those found on the actual Microsoft exam--it may help you learn, but it will take much more time than necessary.I found Professional C# a much better guide to doing well on the exam."
5,A really beautiful meditation book. Great for beginners,"Clear, concise, inspiring chapters present the many benefits of meditation. Simple exercises at the end of each chapter guide readers through a process of personal transformation, with the goal of contributing to outer peace and the raising of global consciousness as well. The foreword is written by H. H. The Dalai Lama. Edited by Paul Cash"
5,The best book on meditation around!,"This book is clear, concise, practical and spiritual at the same time. Indeed quite a combination! The author, a foremost mystic of our time, shares with us a simple meditation technique of contacting the inner Light at theso-called 3rd eye, which has so far beenrevealed only in personal encounters (chp. 4).He also gives very down-to-earth excercises toimprove the physical, emotional and mental life.Do not miss this one!Wulfing von Rohr, German author and TV producer"
5,Highly Recommended,Amazing Book by an Amazing Author. We are blessed to have this book in our life. This can be used by the beginner or by anyone.
1,Should be called: Inner and Outer Peace Through God......lame,"This book had some really good views and ideas on how meditation may make you feel which is only partially what I was looking for. It had a very SMALL chapter on ""HOW TO"" meditate and the rest just talked about ""god"".... I think after the 4th or 5th chapter he must have use the word god about 3 times a sentence. The book started off really good but I had to FORCE myself to finish reading it."
4,Almost the perfect Dance party CD,"I'm impressed by the wide range of musical genres 2 Many DJs incorporates on this fantastic CD. Salt n' Peppa mixed with the Stooges, Skee-lo mixed with Electric Six, Dolly Parton, The Velvet Underground, Felix da Housecat... that's pretty darn awesome. Unfortunately, the entire CD isn't captivating. There are about 2 ten-minute sections on the CD where it dives into relatively mundane techno, void of any Hip Hop or Rock influence---not being a fan of techno, I just hit the skip button a few times. Still, these two sections don't bring down the CD as whole. Perfect for the young scenesters or top 40 gals, this is a great CD filled with songs and mixes that'll perk up anyone's ears at a dance party."
1,exactly: too many djs!,i can't understand how anybody can find this compilation of remixed 80's stuff any good at all.....ok one or two tracks r ok but the rest is awful! many songs on this compilation remix r terrible as it is the guys from 2 many djs however have prooven that they can do worse! - making a bad song worse truly is an effort not anybody could master - they have!
5,Remarkable Novel,"Beautifully translated by Dalia Bilu, this novel is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. A deep and very moving account of a group of young men thrown into a military training camp for misfits -- and the traumatic experiences they undergo. But this is not a heavy novel: it is lyrical, funny, satiric and gripping. The scandal of this novel is that it has not yet received the recognition it deserves, but my prediction is that this is a work that will last."
5,Nursing Informaticists everywhere should be thanking you!,I purchased the implementation book you co-authored and I just wanted to tell you thanks for giving nursing informaticists such a great tool to help us along the way during clinical information system implementations.
3,Her days were drama,"This book was okay but,it has so much drama and sometimes it was boring.If this character would of just of done what she was sopose to do then every thing would have been okay,I got mad at the character sometimes because some of the stupid thing she did.The only good part of the book was how her love life is ,and how she runs away from the dudes that like her.This my review on this book."
4,Benn's Big Book of Glaciers!,"This book is hugely enormous, nd good value. It covers everything, but is a real mothful to try to read through. Look up everything in here, but a tough bed-time read...."
2,Not to my taste,"I think he does great devils, but not into any of his other drawings in this collected sketchbook. If you are a fan, I would look at purchasing one of his other books."
4,Works with Co-Pilot child seat,"I bought this rack as a 2nd one so that we could move our child seat (Co-Pilot) between bikes. The most important piece of information is confirmation that this rack is the one that works with the Co-Pilot (this child seat does not work with all racks!). I have a Diamondback comfort bike (sorry, don't have model handy) and I had no problem installing this. We also installed one on my wife's Haro mountain bike, and, again, had no problem with the installation, so there's 2 data points that say that this is a well-designed and flexible bike rack. In summary, works with the Co-Pilot child seat, sturdy construction (I trust my daughter to it!), easy to install, and flexible for installation on different types of bikes...I guess that's all you would want in a bike rack, right?"
4,bought it to go with CoPilot Limo child seat,"not the beefiest rack, but it works with the kids seat I got free, so I am stuck with it for now. Works well with my panniers, but it does flex a lot when loaded down."
4,Excellent,"This is exactly what we needed to add the child seat to one of our bikes. The instructions are not very clear and the hardware included in the rack does not quite fit all bikes, so you have to be a little creative to istall it. I just wish teir drawings were better. The installation should take 10min. Instead I spent like an hour. Also, the instructions to installed the chair itself are just as bad. But, once you managed to get the rack and chair isntalled, they are there for life and they are also very secure."
4,good for light use,For the price I paid ($40) its a good all in one machine especially for me because I use it only a few times a week so it has been serving the purpose just fine for me.
2,Install destroyed my registry,"This is a nice little printer. Unfortunately, the printer driver install destroyed my regsitry, and I ended up having to re-install Windows XP and all of my apps."
3,Toner Hog,"Love this printer, but it is totally a toner hog. I use this for work in my home office. Quality of the print is great. Ease in use is ""ok"".The scanner feature is not the most friendly for my generation.The biggie ""bad"" feature---toner hog. I have had this about a month and already had to order more toner for both black and white and color, and I don't print that much out each day. Possibly 8-10 sheets of paper a day in black and white and maybe 2 in color."
5,Great value!,"For the price, this is an excellent printer. It was easy to set up & I have had no problems at all. It isn't the faster printer out there, but for my budget it is perfect."
1,HP-All in One,"The problem that I had was not with the printer-it worked just fine. It was the operating software that caused me the most trouble. It would only install about 75% and then it just stopped. I could not return the printer because there was nothing wrong with it. I had no choice but to give it away and take the $75 lose.Incedently, my friend had no trouble at all. It installed perfectly on her computer and worked great ever after. I also found that I could not completly uninstall the software from my computer and then try to reinstall again. I got noware with that.To be perfectly fair though, I would like to say that I have used HP printers for the past 10 years and found them to be very reliable. That was the main reason why I bought this one. Oh well, you live and learn.Milton Wright"
1,An ink vacuum,"This all in one came with my computer, and I rue the day that I didn't pay for an upgrade. At least twice a week I have to buy more ink cartridges.This is not a bargain; you will spend a fortune on ink."
1,Terrible printer,"I bought my 3 in 1 hp printer from walmart, and I have to say that the printer is terrible. It constantly says the paper is jammed when it isn't. At times when I press prinit, nothing will happen. The scanner and the copier is ok, but the printer is terrible."
1,DEAD ON ARRIVAL - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Bought this HP All in One Printer yesterday and today it would not install. First, the on and off switch remained on. Secondly, the printer cartridges motor would not move. So I called HP and they said they would send me another one. Waited on the phone for 45 minutes. Then, I hung up! Back to the store it goes, no more HP for me! This is the second HP Printer that I bought that was defective. However, the first one let me install it and at least it served me for 3 years! My advice to you: DO NOT BUY AN HP!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the first time I've taken the time to write a review. But then again, I have a lot of time on my hands at the moment, while I wait (again) for my printer to decide to work...This printer is a poor performer. Slow, clunky. Very sensitive to any type of error: real or perceived. Print quality is only so-so. Eats through toner at an alarming rate. If you're looking at this machine to purchase, I'd advise you to keep looking You can do better."
1,worst printer I've ever used,"I've never taken the time to write a review of a product before but I am so sick of this printer I had to vent. The paper feed tries to grab all the paper in the paper tray EVERY TIME I try to print. Yes, I separate the sheets of paper and make sure they aren't sticking together. I have to print one sheet of paper at a time. Once I get over that hurdle, I have to pray the cradle won't get stuck or one of the ink cartridges won't fall off the cradle. As already mentioned, it goes through ink incredibly quickly. I've gone through several printers and this is the WORST!"
2,Stay Away From This Printer!!!,"It was a mistake purchasing this printer in the first place. I should've listened to other reviewers complained about how the printer eats up so much ink. This printer looks cheaply made and prints even slowly than my 5 yr older inkjet printer, such a shame.I recently sold this printer and got a laser printer instead, I got the Brother HL-2070N and its great except it's loud when it prints and produce paper curls (but that's expected with most laser printers) and its only $102 from amazon."
4,Love it,"I just bought this today, scanning is very easy, it prints fast.I rated it 4/5 because of the paper tray, it has an input tray, but the out tray is the same input tray separated only a little, unlike my older mode Hp 845C that had two well defined trays.The other thing is the compatible cartridges, Hp 21 and 22 both are 5ml ink cartridges, compared with my older Hp 845C that uses Hp 15 and 17 25ml.We all know that they sell you cheap printers to sac you out buying their ink, but I suggest you to forget about it, don't waste ink, set it on draft by default so that way you don't have to set it to print in draft each time you want to print and keep some cartridges in case you are close to run out of ink, though it tells you when they are running low."
2,Use as copy machine,"HP F380 - A friend was throwing this out. When trying to use it thru the computer it says something is wrong with an ink cartridge and it will not print. But you can just plug it into the wall and don't even have it hooked up to the computer and it will make copies. The copies take about 2 minutes each but it does make a great copy. There probably is something wrong with one of the cartridges but I intend to get use out of both of them. It makes black and white copies and color copies...so there is some ink in both. When I do replace the cartridges you can also use it as a copy machine when hooked up, even if the computer is not on. And hopefully it will make the copies faster when I replace both cartridges. Does anyone know if I can put two black cartridges in it? I never have any need for the color."
4,I got a deal!!!,"Printer arrived in excellent condition and in a timely manner. It was well-packaged (in fact, I'm almost down to the printer!!) Seriously, I am pleased. Set-up was a breeze, as I was replacing an identical printer. I appreciate the honesty and integrity of this seller and give it a ""HIGH FIVE!!""Thank you.....I got a deal!!"
2,Better off with seperate printer and scanner...,"The scanner has no OCR, not a good indicator..Overall, the printer and scanner are decent, it's a cheap price, don't expect high quality. I ended up taking it back, I expected more from an HP, I think I will look elsewhere in the future.."
2,No USB cable provided and overpriced,Received on 7 June and find the Amazon price dropped $10 in the 6 days since ordering. No USB cable included so had to canabilize to connect for use. Not impressed with print compared to an Epson we also have and am concerned about ink costs based on reading reviews but plan to minimize use. That raises a concern for clogged heads from inactivity over lengthy periods of several days or weeks. I guess you get what you pay for (within $10 or so).
2,Avoid HP printers that use the 21 and 22 cartridges,"This would be an outstanding printer if it weren't for the fact that it uses the HP21 and HP22 cartridges. These cartridges only hold 5 mL of ink. So it will appear to be an ink hog, but the real problem is that the ink capacity of these cartridges is way too small. In contrast, the HP14 cartridge holds 26 mL of black ink. You would have to replace your HP21 cartridge 5 times to get the same amount of prints as someone who used an HP inkjet printer that uses the HP14 cartridge.Bottom line, this is a very good printer that you will end up buying a lot of replacement cartridges for. I can't recommend it for that reason alone."
2,Marginal.,"I have a limited selection of printers here in Saudi Arabia. I picked this one up and got a good price. Setup was easy and I was printing in less than fifteen minutes. A couple of points:1. It has no Printer-computer USB cord. Get one yourself.2. I find the documentation lacking. I am of near-average intelligence, but exactly how to resume printing after loading more paper is still a mystery.3. I am using a black ink cartridge a week. They are fairly cheap, but too often I have had to replace a cartridge in mid-job.If the printer cartridges were bigger, I would recommend it. As is, I regret buying it."
1,More HP Junk!!,"Hp.. what a mess your in... why?? Maybe because this is the 4th all-in-one Ive had. They were all defective... even the refurbs you sent after a few months of buying a NEW one.. you continually send out and sell junk! I could go on here.. but people.. you get the point, I HOPE..."
1,not worth the trouble,"this is the worst printer i have come across.the scanner is not bad but printing with it is a nightmare.i can just about manage 10 pages without having to change the cartridge, and that's if it registers what i need printing.buy anything else but this printer"
1,HP Deskjet F380,"I bought this printer just over a year ago and it was OK to start with but now shows paper jam faults all the time and just will not print.The paper path is completely clear and the paper aligned correctly.I can't clear the problem and the HP support is less than helpful.The F380 eats ink cartridges and is the ultimate proof that you get what you pay for.Avoid at all costs, even if it's a freebie!."
5,Highly Recommended,Jaid Black never fails to amaze me. No Mercy is just as hot and fun as the Empress New Clothes. The characters are well developed and i would like to read more of the people of Planet Tryston. Keep em coming Ms Black.
5,this is even better than The Empress New Clothes,I loved this book so much I've read it about four times. If you already read the first book you will like the sexiness and the humor in this one just as much if not more. The heroine in this one is so funny you spend as much time laughing as you do reaching for a glass of ice water.
1,Cheapened 2,"This book was not worth the money. It wasn't very well written and lacked in character definition. Unless you like public sex, female domination, sinpering, weak female characters, and barbaric men, this book is not for you. For such an advanced people, these characters seem to be stuck in the Dark Ages."
3,All about SOME perennials,The previous customer review stated this was a comprehensive book on perennials. I just bought this book and tried to find out more information about perennials offered on catalogs without success. This book is good but not an all inclusive reference book on perennials.
3,bad odor,"Overall I rate this specific product from the seller a three. The time frame in which I received it was very good as well as the actual condition of the used book. However, when I got the book it had a REALLY bad odor! I honestly think that whomever was selling the book knew that it stunk because they tried to cover it up by spraying it with a fragrance. The combo of the odor AND the frangrance was to the point where I didnt even want to touch it. I threw it away and just went and purchased it from the bookstore!"
1,Worst game of the year,"We spent more time reading the directions than we did playing the game. I thought it would be light, fun, way to get to know people - it caused tension."
4,My son loves it!,"Our family received this game as a gift a couple years ago. We have found the more people you play with the more fun it is. Also playing with different people each time makes it interesting. The game does get a little long sometimes, but we still like it. My son is 10 now and still often chooses this game to play. He finds the questions funny and also everyone's answers let him find out new things about family and friends. I was suprised the other ratings were so low since we have played many times and always have fun."
1,Not what I expected,"I normally enjoy self help books but i found this one to be a bit on the dictatorship side. It provided some helpful info but it's not very free thinking, which if what i look for in spiritual books. I suggest books by Shakti Gawain for that kind of free thinking."
3,A suggestion,"When I ordered this book for an Easter gift I thought it would be good for my grandson. When it arrived, the hard bound cover looked like it was handled with icky fingers or hands. I thought I was buying new? I just suggest seller to be careful. Money is hard to come by and I expect books that I buy as new to be nice."
4,Fantastic,"4+ stars. Simple string orchestrations, lots of acoustic guitar, piano & organ but it's the understated electric touches and vocal harmonies that give it a languid, California-esque feel. Such a consistent vibe that it almost feels like a concept album - even with the pleasant changes of pace provided by ""John Brown"" and ""Found Bird"" which sound as if they are off of an E. Morricone western soundtrack. Melancholic, smile inducing pop. Standouts = ""John Brown"", ""Sandy"", ""Outside Looking In"" though the album is so thoroughly of a piece overall that you feel guilty singling out any single track. A cd completely successful in creating its own world and making you glad you were able to visit."
4,Theo's Ghost,"Regina Pounds has written a delightful debut Romance novel! If you're an avid Romance reader and want something a little different, you'll enjoy this historical set in 19th C. Prussia. If you're a bit tired of reading about passion in the boudoir and want a story about the joys and tribulations of falling in love, you'll really appreciate this particular love story. Ms. Pounds has a witty style that's all her own, and her heroine is just as unique. Especially as she enlists the aid of a ghost to win the heart of a very earth-bound man!Hopefully, there will be many more novels coming out by Regina Pounds. I'd strongly suggest you don't miss the first."
4,Unusual and diverting,"This book was a lot of fun! The unusual setting and a charming cast of characters made it instantly diverting, and the plot had quite enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested. Miss Pounds obviously knows her stuff, and romance readers have a new author to add to their ""favorites"" list!"
3,advertized wrong item,"I've been looking everywhere for the Winsor 20min, workout (DVD). The product I purchased wasadvertised as that DVD, but instead I got the Abs workout.It is completely different and am still looking for the original Winsor Pilates 20 Minute workout!"
1,my mistake,I am so disappointed because I thought this was a DVD when I bought it. Why are they even selling VHS anymore. I was really bummed when I opened the package. A lesson to always read the fine print.
1,reviewing brentweood home video version,"I have to agree with the past reviewer that the scenes they cut out would have made it a watchable movie. All that I was left with was Jim Kelly beating up other grown men AND midgets. The final fight against the strong guy was the most trouble I had paying attention to a movie in a long time. I do have to say that Kelly did have acting ability, just don't expect for it to get showcased in this movie.So make sure that the version that you get is uncut, and it might help you make it through the movie. The Brentwood version is 81 minutes long."
4,Long Live Jim Kelly,"This title, as bad in production value as it is, definitely ranks up there with the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. I laughed so hard at times, I nearly cried. Either they were doing this tongue in cheek, which then makes it brilliant, or it was complete schlock. Either way, it's a keeper for the library.NOTE: I bought the VHS version thinking it would contain the edited footage, but it does not. Seems there is no fully uncut version available, because someone wrote the DVD version is edited. Ripoff.Jim Kelly is a classic, and when he delivers the line ""your credibility has reached an all time low"", he is unforgettable."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This is single-handedly the worst movie I have ever seen. First of all, the movie was devoid of any plot (at least one that I was aware of). Between fending off dwarves and blind, yellow belt ""martial artists"" and come-ons from the femme fatale, who looked like a run-down Sheila-E, Kelly should have definitely kept to what he knows best---hairstyling and red track suits.Action sequences squander great potential: in one scene where the black samurai tours the canopy in a rocketeer jet backpack, he can't find anyone to fight with, so he just lands and the scene ends. In the final fistfight, the enemy goons look like they spent more time playing dungeons and dragons than hitting the gym. I would rather get kicked in the mid-section several hundred times by the midgets in the movie than bear watching this sad excuse for a movie again. Caveat emptor."
4,Lots of fun and some really good Vulture-Fu,"I once again come to write a review on one of my favorites and find out that the DVD version that I own is all cut up!! How did I miss all these greats on VHS?!?!? Anyway, I'm over it... First off this movie has awesome fight scenes, including a great one of Jim Kelly vs a Vulture, and the final fight scene which is dubbed so horribly, you can't even tell who is supposed to be talking sometimes. And it has the BEST jet pack scene ever in a movie. As much as I'm dissapointed that I missed all the of the nudity and Bad Language, I still love this movie very much. And it will always have a special place on my shelf right next to ""Nine Deaths of the Ninja"" and ""Petey Wheatstraw: The Devil's Son-In-Law"""
4,Black Samu-rai-Yah!!!,"This is a 4 star movie considering it came out in the seventies.It's an action-packed,action flic with lots of cool martial-art moves.And don't forget those groovy ""Afros"".Jim Kelly makes it look easy,to be a karate-kickin'machine!!!"
1,What a terrible film !!!!!!!!!!,"First of all let me say I love Jim Kelly but this movie is just plain awful, the acting is the worst i have ever seen and even the fights not the best Jim has ever done.I actually turned the film off half way through because I was so bored with the story line.Thank god Jim did ""Black Belt Jones"" !!"
5,The TV is great. the sound is not the best but its good...,The sound could be better. but since most people who buy a large tv are gonna have a good surround sound setup it really does not matter. also the sleep timer could be a little easier. and the remote will only control RCA audio components. Not any other brand! .
5,RCA - Newfound quality,"Yes, we all know the RCA name has not always been synonymouswith a quality product. However, I took a chance on this TV last Julyand have had absolutely no problems. The picture is beautiful, and the features are plentiful for the price. In short, I have been so happy that I recently purchased an RCA DVD player and RCA digital surround sound system as well. Those items have also performed flawlessly. Simply put, this is again a company moving in the right direction. Need more proof? Go to your local audio/video superstore and compare RCA's HDTV and digital receivers with the competition's. Like the other products I mention, you'll find similar quality, more features, and a much lower price. For fellow college students or electronics freaks on a budget, take a chance like I did. You won't be sorry!"
1,I'm with that guy from DC!,"My wife and I are shopping for a new TV right now... same reason as the guy from DC. Our RCA tube blew out almost immediately, was replaced under warranty and the new one blew last night in the exact middle of the season finale of the Sopranos? Conspiracy? Thanks for nothing RCA!"
2,Blown Tube as well,"I bought my RCA 32"" only 3 weeks ago and the picture tube has already blown. I bought it only because it was significantly cheaper than other 32"" TVs. I guess I got what I paid for. I would highly suggest either getting an extended warranty on it or looking elsewhere for a tv. Its one highly redeeming feature in the new models is the on screen TV guide which costs you absolutely nothing."
5,the benchmark,"If you could only ever buy one book on probability, this would be the one!Feller's elegant and lateral approach to the essential elements of probability theory and their application to many diverse and apparently unrelated contexts is head-noddingly inspiring.Working your way through all the exercises in the book would be an excellent retirment diversion sure to stave off the onset of dementia."
1,Drifter,I took a chance and ordered this radio after reading mixed reviews. The first red flag was that I couild not find this model listed on Grundigs website although it is marketed as Grundig by Eton. Whatever that means. I read reviews that said the radio suffers from station drift but I also read that the problem was supposed to be fixed on the deluxe model. Well I experienced the same drifting problem as many other people did. I hate to rate anything as a one star but the radio is pretty much useless to me and I went through the process of ordering and now returning the item.To be specific the problem I have experienced is that once a radio station is tuned in it would randomly jump to playing static and the LCD readout began displaying numbere erratically.
4,Good radio what i expected,This is a good beginner SW radio till i can afford a better one. I read all the reviews and knew what to expect. I have a KAITO SW/AM/FM with the MP3 recorder player worked good till i dropped something on it and broke MP3 modual anyway LCD screen on that radio was way to small for my old eyes. This one finaly went down in price so i bought it nice big lighted display and great audio for the one ear i can hear out of after stroke i had a few years ago. With one of those wind up antennas i had receives pretty good. I think when i save a bit i will get a Grundig 750 till then this will do just fine. I am using AA battery's 4 Sanyo Eneloops but for me only works for about two long days of listening then they go down one bar on display out of four have not tried D battery's yet. \But it does work good with wall wart with no interference.
3,Not the AM receiver I Expected,"I purchased the radio based on the many reviewers comments about the strong AM reception. My experience is much different. I use it when I am in my motor home and usually far from strong signals. I enjoy talk radio and I don't want to miss them when I am in the motor home. All I get is static, even when I added the tuning antenna it still can't get reception inside the MH. Outside it is very weak and full of static.Overall the design, size, and operation is what I expected it is very good. I rate it three stars due to the poor AM reception. I have very limited us of the FM and SW both seem to be fine. I would not recommend this for AM reception for other use it's OK."
3,Eaton 350,"A few weeks ago I purchased a Grundig 450 radio. This was supposed to be the new improved model that replaced the 350. Short story is it was a junk, and Radio Shack reluctantly gave me my money back. My car radio had better AM reception. While at Fry's I found the Eaton 350, and purchased it. Still not as good as my truck radio, but an improvement over the 450 model. Something has happened with these newer Eaton (Grundig)radios as they don't perform as well as their older counterparts. My older Grundig 350 was knocked over board in about 200' of water, and was the reason I purchased a new one. It pulled in stations from many miles away, while the newer version seems to struggle. I am working on getting a external antenna to help with reception for the AM side. Bottom line is don't expect much, reception wise, from these newer Eaton radios. These are not your father's Grundig radios......lol"
1,Frequency drifting,"This radio will not stay on frequency once a station is tuned in. It drifts away sometimes right away, sometimes after a minute or two. When searching up or down using the tuning knob at some points (random) the led frequency readout starts spuriously jumping around and ends up at a completely different frequency. This makes this radio completely useless to me. I have read other reviews since purchasing this Grundig radio and the reviewers report the same problem. This problem is no reflection on Amazon, it is a shortcoming of this particular Grundig model. I do NOT recommend it to anyone."
5,Grundig GS350DL Field Radio a great radio,"The GS350DL Field Radio by Grundi is receiving signals from great distances, and produces clear voice and music qualities, with no distortion at high volume. It seems lighter than other radios of it's size we have owned. Used it for a month now and We are very pleased with our purchase!"
2,REcommend Lookig at Other Products,"I bought this radio because a friend had one, however his was made several years ago. I have had numerous problems with the radio's features & quality. After 3.5 months, I am trying to return the radio. I may have gotten a defective unit.My recommendation you can get much more value / quality for your money by buying a different brand / model radio."
1,Oops!,"I ordered this radio hoping for a wonderful radio, as other reviewers had promised. It came in today and I just sent it back. I always thought Grundig was a great name in electronics. When I tried to tune in a nearby FM station that I listen to regularly, I could not get it clearly. There was a lot of static and hissing or whatever. The speaker was very poor quality and certainly would NOT fill a room with sound. I have a little Sony ICF-SW7600GR radio that I bought from Amazon a year or so ago for more money than this one cost. It works far better, has far better sound even though it is very small compared to this Grundig. Some people seem to have had good luck with this radio so perhaps I got a lemon."
2,Grundig lousy reception,I bought the Grundig S350 radio for my mother who was not getting very good reception on her radio. She listens to a foreign language station that has very limited range and wanted a radio with better reception. She thought a German radio would be superior and would give herbetter reception. It has not and she is very disappointed.Another problem with the radio is when a switch to FM to AM is made the previous channel is lost and has to be reprogrammed again. It is a tremendous nuisance. We will not buy another ETon company product.
2,not happy,I have not used the radio much and already the turning button falls off. You can hear fm music when on short wave. I bought another antena and still do not pick up much of anything
1,Grundig S350DL - very disappointing,"Looked great on-screen at Amazon, arrived OK, got it out of the box, AM/SW bandswitch knob lying loose in the box...120v Power adaptor in the box is the wrong one. In NZ we are 240v. You would think someone would check the country of destination. Went out and bought one. Then found that the mini-jack is wired the other way around so had to cut and reverse-wire it.AM/SW bandswitch is intermittent/faulty, may have something to do with the fact that the knob had come off in transit.Finally, the tuning is hopeless - there's so much 'free-play' in the mechanical part of it that it takes pot luck to land exactly on frequency.I feel ripped off, and I wouldn't buy it again. I'm too busy to mess around returning it to Amazon (I can't just 'take it back to the store'!) so I guess I'll just have to live with it.What a shame - especially with the Grundig name attached to it. Clearly brand names don't mean much anymore.Disappointed Kiwi"
1,The Worst I've Heard In A Long Time.,"I've owned various receivers both portable and desktop in my time, but this is the worst ever. If you like radios that specialize in front end overloads and false images (birdies) this is the set for you. If you're a beginner and have never gone into short wave listening, get into another receiver so your first impressions are good ones. I have managed to question other users in various newsgroups on the Internet and they have the same thing to say about the set. Maybe they're more tolerant of the poor performance and noise this thing generates. I've owned this thing for almost one week only because it took me six days to bring it back. If this is the example of modern day engineering in portable receivers, I'll stick to my older receivers, thanks."
1,No AC adapter!,"Received the package yesterday, great shipping from Amazon! When I opened the box there was NO AC adapter. the box says it comes with 3 things, and mine only came with two. Product works with batteries, so I will live, just a disappointment. Another thing, could not find their website."
4,Grundig S350 AM/FM Shortwave Radio,"I was looking for a good quality well built radio. I tried many others, some that held the I-pod, some that had large speakers, none were any good. I needed a unit with great reception and fairly good sound quality. I read an article on the performance of Grundig, and I liked what I was reading. I recently purchased the Grundig S-350 AM/FM Shortwave Radio and I'm very happy with the performance."
5,grundig s350,The Grundig radio I ordered arrived in approximately 5 days.This is an excellent portable radio; great reception & excellent sound.I highly recommend this radio; great price for the quality.
3,one downside...,When the radio is on it continues to display the call numbers of the station. I would like it to go back to 'time mode' display after a few seconds of the radio on. My radio is @ 10 years old - volume knob is 'crackly' when adjusting.
4,Sleep Timer,"This is not really a review. I will probably update this after I have had a chance to really get to know this radio. I recently purchased a GS350DL from RadioShack and so far I am quite happy with it, but I was on the verge of returning it because the Sleep Timer does not work according to the instructions on page 15 of the manual. It says repeated pressing of the Power&Sleep button will finally set the Sleep Timer to off which is how I would like use the radio. Unfortunately this does not happen and the sleep interval simply cycles around to 90 again. Luckily I noticed the instructions on Page 11 regarding turning the radio on and off, and that saved the sale. All you have to do is hold the button for a second and the radio will turn on without the Sleep Timer being activated. I just thought I'd mention this for people like myself who are sure they know all about turning a radio on and off."
3,Grundig S350,"I researched portable radios for about a month. This radio had great reviews, looked neat, and seemed to be what I needed. Unfortunately I work in a corporate building and even with an additional $30 powered antenna this did not pull anymore than my old sony clock radio. Radio did have nice sound, the knobs did seem flimsy as othere mentioned but was OK for a $90 radio. I am sure it is great but not for my application so luckily I returned it before the 30 days."
4,Grundig S350 Deluxe AM FM Shortwave Radio,"My parents live in a cement/brick building and were not able to get radio reception on their old AM/FM clock radio. The S350 is coming through loud and clear with no additional AM antenna. The sound quality is a bit ""tinny"" on some stations, but compared to no reception whatsoever, they are thrilled.They listen primarily to AM talk radio.I am very pleased with this product, which is reasonably priced."
5,A Sure Winner,"I can easily see why this book has been proclaimed one of 1998's best. ""An American Killing"" is a terrific read with a master's touch. The author's character development is exceptional and the story line one of the best I have read in a good while.If you're looking for a book to keep you company for a night, this is the one. I couldn't put it down until I had finished. The end may surprise but will not disappoint."
2,Tepid,"I read this based on a number of recommendations and regret it. I found the characters unlikable and unsympathetic, and the novel's pace hindered by far too much name-dropping and gossip. The settings need more pop and the final act is rushed, implausible, and unsatisfying. Far too much is left dangling. I found the writing pedestrian at best and sometimes wondered if this was meant to be funny; it's my understanding that Smith is known as a humorist, but all too often this book seemed like a joke that I just didn't get."
5,The Political Thriller of the Summer,"Yeah, I know. Summer's over. Unfortunately, I didn't get all my summer reading done in the allotted three months. AN AMERICAN KILLING is the best book I've read this summer. It has everything: murder, mayhem, secrets, clues, deception, sex, drugs! (No rocknroll, I'm afraid.) There are even some political names dropped, which makes the book very timely, but it won't always be so. Read it now!"
2,Not that good,"Seemed promising at first, but the authors penchant for veering off the subject to explain events in the past that had no real bearing on the story was irritating. That, plus the odd name dropping, was distracting and took away (I felt) from the central characters and plot."
1,Dreadful,"This is the worst book I have read in a long time, and I have read some turkeys. It gets one star only because that is the lowest rating the Amazon software allows; I would rather give it none. The author has a clunky awkward style; the characters are flat stilted cliches and the plot just meanders around in a vacuum. I gave this book a fair trial (188/360 pages) and simply could not read any more and threw it out. The author tries to be cynical about people (and People, the magazine) who drop others' names, but does the same thing herself. Don't be fooled by the Clinton connection trumpeted by the promoters; it's just made up and has little, if anything, to do with this book. This book is a dreadful monotonous tedious shapeless thing; how it ever found a publisher is a greater mystery than the one in the plot."
2,An American Love Affair,One BIG problem I have with this book is Ms. Smith's amorous perception of the Clintons. Why authors of fiction think I care about their political leanings is beyond me. Ms. Smith goes out of her way to portray the Clintons as a normal family. PLEASE!!!Just get to the thrust of the story and leave the Clintons in the political hell they have earned.
3,Saddle is okay,"I unfortunately had to return mine, its seemed nice, and very good quality, but only it was 2 inches (lenght) smaller than my current one. I think should be sold for youth as women size."
1,Never buy from this company,Received this item and installed it on my bike. Once I started to ride I noticed the seat was wearing quickly and it was actually the wrong seat from what I ordered. I sent several emails to the company and all they said is sorry we can't help you it has been over 30 days. Very poor customer service if you ask me. Even though they sent me the wrong item they would do nothing to help me.I will never buy anything from this company again!!! Horrible customer service.
4,Great Product,"The qiuck release mount was the answer to my need for a little more room when I am using my boat as a ski boat. It was a little tight when first mounted, but as the mounting instructions said, opening up the locking handle holes cured this problem easily."
5,Works Great,Its a lot easier now to take the trolling motor on/off the boat now and if you decide to leave it on your boat you can lock it up. Very easy to install.
2,Snap crackel pop,"The songs are good, but every recording has static background noise that is quite loud like a scratched up old record. It is very distracting. I understand you can't expect good quality from recordings this old, but also I think some might be disappointed. Just saying it is what it is."
2,Falls Short on Details and Relevant Information,"Innocent Targets: When Terrorism Comes to School by Michael Dorn and Chris Dorn is really a brief overview of school violence related to terrorism. Chapters 1-4 discuss terrorist events that have occurred in schools. Unfortunately, the information is so brief and without significant analysis that is fails to add value to the book. In addition, there is some information presented on the Beslan school massacre that is not factually correct. The remainder of the book has sections on:- Terrorist Tendencies- Combating Terrorism in Schools- Impacts and AnalysisAgain, these sections are very brief and really leave out significant detail. Innocent Targets is more of an outline on important information that must be considered to have safer schools. I do not believe this book would be a valuable resource for those looking to implement a school safety plan.This is not a book that I would recommend."
4,Minor Prophets of Judah - from a Bible Class teacher,"This book was very helpful as I prepared for a Fall Bible class. It is Biblically sound, gets right to the point and was easily adaptable with other reference materials I have been using. The author coupled the historical setting and message with practical applications."
5,"Superb, as usual","This little book packs a mighty wallop in that it speaks in a warm, loving, accepting and compassionate way about positive topics. It has helped me to think more clearly about forgiving abuse I experienced as a child. Very comforting and wise! I have used it with a group of Christian women without naming the origin. It was very well received."
2,Not nearly as substantial as I'd hoped.,"While this collection of thoughts and quotes and stories is a good one, I was hoping for something a little more soul-searching and a little less ""Jack Tandy, Deep Thoughts."" That said, this book has some great quotes and quips in it, and is an enjoyable read. But if you're looking (like I was) for a Buddhist perspective on forgiveness and how that might contrast with other ideas of forgiveness (Christian, say), this book disappoints."
4,i like this a lot,"its an easy read, still reading it, and will have as a guide. speaks easy truths that one may need a gentle reminder on.. it's a keeper."
5,A must read,"Good for the soul. I agree that it is a ""spiritual truffle."" Very uplifting and freeing when practiced in one's life. And a joy to share with others. There is a lot of wisdom here."
4,simple easy to remember concepts,"I like best the definition of ""to forgive"" - to let go of hope of a different past."
1,Not helpful for ME,"While I can see how this book could be helpful for some, this was not the case for me. I found the approach naive and superficial, replete with ""catch phrases"" and ""bumper-sticker"" advice. As one who has been struggling with a serious situation for quite some time, I bought the book in the hopes of getting closure and finding a way to deal with the past and be happy again. I DID find such a book online, and recommend it highly for those who need a practical and realistic approach to personal growth and peace: FORGIVENESS: How to Make Peace with Your Past and Get on With Your Life. The authors are Sidney and Suzanne Simon, who provide validation, information, and practical methods for attaining closure and putting the past behind in order to move on with your life. The book has helped me gain control of my emotions and DO something to improve my outlook. It has changed my life! -JP"
1,"Insane and deceptive ad. NOT a creeper chair!, just a wheel!","Do not be fooled by this insane and deceptive ad. NOT a creeper chair!, just a wheel! I repeat. You are not buying the creeper-chair if you add this item to your cart. You are only getting a wheel!"
1,Loved by squirrels,"I purchased this feeder along with a plastic baffle, thinking it would be double proof. However, the very determined, tenacious, destructive squirrels found a way to dismount the baffle and the feeder. Both came crashing down and shattered. No more feeders for me."
3,Doesn't work well and rusts,Squirrels learn quickly to hang from the top of this feeder so as not to close the lid/gates over the food. Rusts after a couple of seasons.
2,poor customer service,"The unit arrived broken, I called Heritage Farms customer support and got a voice recording saying to leave a message and they would get back to me. No call back so I did the same thing the next day with the same results. After 3 days I gave up. I will not buy from Heritage Farms again"
1,soso,It does a good job keeping out the squirrels but it also keeps out the birds. because of that I dont recomend it.
2,broke on arrival,"the feeder was broken on arrival. even so, i so, i do not believe it would deter any squirrels. chincy made in china!"
3,Worked for a short while but...,"I bought one of these and it seemed to be working pretty well, so I bought another one. A month or so later the squirrels had figured out how to hold onto the wire hanger at the top with their back feet and eat from the feed tray without having their weight close the cover hatch. It's a decent feeder but not really squirrel proof."
2,Not squirrel proof,"I chose this feeder, not for its looks, but in the hope that it would be squirrel proof. It's not.I have hung this feeder from a pole and my squirrels have learned to either 1) jam their face or fist under the trap while they balance on the pole or 2) take flying leaps from the top of the pole and spread seed on the ground to hoover up later. It may work if it is hanging from a tree branch with nothing to launch off or balance on, but we don't have low lying branches so can't try to see.I am going to try one with a built in squirrel baffle."
4,A good feeder,"We have this feeder hanging on a bracket attached to the window frame-2nd storey. No squirrels have been able to access it (so far!), tho' they've tried. Birds love it. We had a big version of the same feeder in years past, hanging on a pole on the lawn. Wish I had taken a pic of the squirrel squatting INSIDE it, with the top in place, stuffing himself w/seeds. NOT squirrel proof at all. The feeder finally met its end when a bear bent the wrought-iron pole to the ground and destroyed the feeder whilst consuming the seeds. Definitely NOT bear-proof either!"
5,Squirrel prrof feeder,"Absolutely wonderful squirrel proof feeder-only thing that has worked for me ever. The squirrels just eat the seed off the ground, they cannot penetrate the fortress of this metal feeder.Highly recommend, great value for the money, clears up squirrel problems, I finally really feel like I am just feeding the birds, instead of always feeding the squirrels!"
2,bird feeder,"It is made well but doesn't have a long enough perch for birds as large as cardinals, therefore the only birds that frequent the feeder are sparrows."
1,Birds can't eat out of it,"I had this feeder hanging from my back deck for 3 weeks, and the birds couldn't figure out how to get to the seed. I do get lots of birds coming for seed every day at different feeders. Maybe mine was a lemon, but when the sparrows landed on it, they could no longer see the opening to the seed tray, and finally, fewer and fewer birds bothered with it. I wrote to Heritage Farms (well, Kay Home Products) and sent them photos of the birds being confused, but they had nothing to say except that I should return it. So I did."
2,Several issues,"Feeder arrived from the supplier without the necessary parts to hold the hanger on. I emailed the company and told them that I was using a couple of safety pins to make it work. They emailed me back and said they were happy I could make it work.... I was really looking for some parts to be sent to me. One side of the perch for the birds fell apart within four months - yes it could have been the raccoon hanging on it. And then every time it would rain the slightest little bit, the seed would get wet, turn into a sticky mess and no longer come out. I recently just threw it away......"
4,Good Bird Feeder,I bought this for my mom for Christmas last year. She loves this thing and all the birds that come to it. I like the squirrel proof design and it seems to work well. I hung this feeder on a shepherds hook which makes it a little harder for the squirrels to get on anyway. So far she has not had any problems with it and can't wait for the spring to get it out again.
4,Works with a bungee cord,"I've tried a couple other squirrel proof feeders. This one holds seed the longest, BUT I have to wrap a bungee cord around the bottom and link at the top to hold the lid down. Otherwise, the squirrel climbs right in and has a feast!"
2,"""Cardinal Proof"" but not ""Squirrel Proof""","The perches are much smaller than I thought they would be and the cardinals cannot perch and feed on this feeder. Smaller birds - finches, nuthatches, chickadees and sparrows - have no problem.It's not squirrel proof as they figured out on the second day how to hang from the bottom, avoiding the perch, and eat seed out of the trough. It's not easy for them though and has slowed down the amount of seed I was going through. Also, the top of the feeder slides up easily and they can get inside it by just pushing the top up. My husband put a clamp on one side to fix that problem.I'm disappointed that the cardinals can't get into this feeder and will keep my platform feeder up for them. So in the end, I guess I'm not really using less of the expensive birdseed after all!"
1,Not Squirrel proof,"I have had this feeder for about a year. The squirrels have figured out how to lift the top and climb inside then proceed to clean out the feeder completely. In addition, they have somehow managed to bend the metal ""perch"" feeder area so that even when they step on it, it doesn't completely close and they have access to the food. Stop-A-Squirrel feeders are much better."
2,Squirrel's Too Persistent,It only took the squirrels 3 days to figure this one out. Now they can empty it in a day!
3,"Nice Feeder - Birds love it, but so do the squirrels","Very nice feeder, but if you have trouble with persistent squirrels, like I do, they will find a way to get to the bird seed. They just hang on the side, away from the spring-loaded perch, and reach around for their meal."
1,Not Squirrel Proof,"Don't be fooled, a hungry squirrel is much smarter than you Heritage Farms! As I stand here looking out the window, we see a fat squirrel hanging from the top of the feeder upside down, working the feeder mechanism to get his grubby claws on the food, with much success and what appears to be little effort. Later, we see him actually inside the container! Meanwhile two little birds stand idly by about 10 feet away awaiting thier turn at the trough.My wife has tried several of these sham feeder products to no avail. If anyone has found an actual squirrel proof feeder, that also allows birds to feed, please contact me."
3,Squirrels are smarter,"I thought I will finally beat the squirrels. I unfortunately have a high overhanging branch that is to high for me to reach and cut down. A squirrel climbs on the branch. flies off the branch on to the middle of the bid pole (which has 4 hooks) and is able to sit on the bird perch on this feeder. The feeder does not completely colse and the squireel can squeeze its paw and grab one seed at a time. granted it takes it longer and I do not have as much seed wasted. However, i fear that eventually the squirrel will break this feeder."
1,Smart Squirrels - Dumb Feeder,"Unfortunately for me, New Jersey squirrels are just too smart for this this ""spuirrel proof"" feeder! I've seen that they either lunge out from the tree where it is hanging or hang down from the roof of the feeder to get the food. Either way, the money spent on this ""squirrel proof"" feeder was a waste of money as my bird seed bills continue to soar and the squirrels just keep getting fatter! Save your money on this one and look for something else!"
1,NOT squirrel proof,"I had high hopes for this feeder, based off others' reviews. However, our resident squirrel must be too wiley for this feeder. It still manages to cling to the tree, lean on the bar and eat out of the ports without the door closing (will try placing it further out on a branch away from the tree--). I just noticed the spring adjustment when I went out to refill it. Will see if adjusting it solves the issue regarding the trap door closing sufficiently. May contact the company regarding this feature; it is the whole reason I bought this feeder. Debating returning it. Otherwise, seems to be sturdy construction. Will update this review.UPDATE 10/31/2012:This morning, a week after purchase (even with a baffle hanging above the feeder), a squirrel managed to knock down and break the acrylic panel on the side of the feeder, spilling seed onto the ground. Back it goes."
4,Best I have found yet,Squirrels do learn how to hang from the sides without touching rail. Fortunately they can only nibble because of grate.
2,"Squirrel proof for about 2 months, then not","Even with a baffle, the squirrels learn how to push up the lid, then go inside the feeder to eat. If you like entertainment value, it is really fun to see a squirrel sitting inside the feeder, happily eating away. It takes about 2 months for the squirrels to figure out the lid is not secured and they can easily lift it off and hop inside to eat."
4,Not easy listening,"This was a bit ponderous, and I found I had to listen to it several times and read the libretto to really appreciate it. Definitely not easy listening."
4,ISinging vs. dance,"This is a vey interesting take on a seldom performed opera.The singing is universally superb --- especially Filanote and Frittoli. The staging is rather static (like many La Scala productions) but really gorgeous to look at. There is a lengthy ballet sequence in act two which contains some of the worst choreography I have ever seen --- really shameful for such an excellent house.Over all, it is easy to see why the opera is not often done. The libretto is so lame that even Rossini, who can usually make a musical setting of the telephone book interesting, couldn't entirely save it from boredom. There is, however, some really wonderful music and it is full of imaginative melody and interesting orchestration. Worth owning. While the ballet is going on, close your eyes and just listen!"
2,Minimal pictures,Very interesting subject; wish authors had provided more substance. Very disappointed with lack of photos especially with constant reminder of photographers who were amongst group of explorers. I too also have my doubts regarding editors/publisher of this book.Would NOT recommend purchasing.
5,Lyrically Wonderful,There's a lot of buzz generating in NYC about this book so I had to check it out.These guys know their city adventures and they also know their philosophy and literature. Who would think that an old abandoned aqueduct would bring to mind the words of Dante's Inferno?Great summer reading. Not too smart to be boring but it never talks down to you. You'll definitely look at everyday bridges and rooftops and basements as inspirations after reading this book.Highly recommended.
5,my favorite book I've read this year,"Just wanted to let anyone out there know that this is indeed a wonderful, well-written book that's great fun to read. It's so exciting to think about all the secret locations that surround us, and how adventure and exploration can still live in this day and age. It's inspired me to stop taking my hometown of Kansas City for granted and to start my own explorations here.Highly recommended."
2,"Interesting, Sometimes Provoking, Not Academic","This is a good, fast read and good if you are interested in the subject of urban hacking, etc. Some of the adventures and the exposition is thought provoking, but some of the opinions come a bit out of the blue. I would not recommend it as any kind of reference or academic resource, but would reccomend it for a nice quick read on the subject."
3,"Good, but not great","I really looked forward to buying this book, because I was looking for an interesting, but uncluttered, way of displaying my pottery, vintage jewelry, etc. Unfortunately, though some of the illustrations are interesting, very few of them are truly creative. Most of the ideas I could have come up with on my own. And I was hoping that there would be some kind of ""how to"" aspect to the book as well, so that if I did see something I liked (i.e. shelves), there might be instructions as to how to create them. Unfortunately, there were not.Though I'll hang onto this book for occassional inspiration, it wasn't nearly as wonderful as I hoped."
4,Great salsa album for novice salseros,"This is a great salsa album for the novice/beginner salsa dancer, as it has a good range of music with plenty at a slow to medium tempo."
1,Non-existant satellite dish,"The satellite dish that I order never came. My attempts to contact the seller were never acknowledged. Now I will have to start over with a new internet merchant and watch my credit card statements to be sure and contest the charge. I would not recommend this seller, they are a waste of time."
2,Not worth it...,"Disappointed. This book appears to be a great resource for P1800 and 122 info, but it's poorly written and poorly layed out. For example, the author will be talking about a 1968 model and the picture above the text shows a 1957 model. It's hard to locate specific info on each model year because the author will switch from discussing a 122s to a 544 model made 20 years before it in the same paragraph. The pictures aren't that good either, most are of modified cars, not stock. It's missing important information such as prices, which years & models were best, buying tips, etc. I guess this book would be an OK addition to other books on the P1800 and 120 series, but it fails miserably as a single source and that's what most people (like me) want. If you could still get the ""Illustrated Volvo Buyer's Guide by John Matras"" which is unfortunately out of print, nobody would bother with this one. Don't waste your money."
2,Globbing problems,"While this product does seem to help with the arthritic aches and pains, there seems to be a globbing problem when trying to apply it. It does not go on smoothly and therefore some of the benefit is lost."
3,Excellent Dinner Party Idea,Great Game - I would ONLY recommend this for 6 players - the two additional had no lines and was almost excluded.
2,"Bad recipes, lame mystery","The recipes were so so, and ridiculously complicated, and the mystery itself wasn't quite as obvious as a kick in the head, but nearly. Besides which, it was scripted, you actually had to sit there and read parts, which I thought made the whole thing a little stilted. I've definitely done better ones -- keep shopping."
3,A gift to neighbor who loves this kind of toy.,Gave it as a gift. Person was over joyed but has yet to hold the party. If one is careful with it you could change the story line and improve upon the twists and turns of the plots and re-do the party over and over about once a year without investing in yet another expensive item. I thought it was a tad expensive for the too dark printed material and pictures on invitations etc. Lots of room for improvements here. As to how it works I would rather see a game where the hostess does not have to orchestrate or know in advance the who did it and nitty gritty story line. Perhaps just telling the host what gender and type of character without revealing whole plot would work better over all. They sell books on how to write your own version of these party games too. I suggest looking here on Amazon for one. I think we'll get one for our neighbor for next year instead of another pre-boxed game.
2,Ruined Party,"I ordered this game for a New Years Eve party. I based my entire night around it. It started off fun, but tnere were typos and mistakes in the character booklets. Also, the directions for when to play the cd were different in the booklets and on the cd and were incorrect. It told us to play the next track after round 2 and when we did, it told us the answer and we never got to finish the game or guess. It ruined the party and took all the fun out of the game. I was extremely upset and disappointed."
4,Fun Dinner Party Material,"We had a New Year's Eve dinner party with this game with six people. It kept everyone entertained between courses until midnight. We dressed in camped-up formal wear rather than the suggested costumes and everyone had a ball with their characters. Would recommend this for adult parties. Only wish we had a choice of different endings so we could play the game again with other sets of friends. Once you know who dunnit it, the game isn't re-playable."
4,Murder Mystery Kit,Eight friends and I had a memorable evening with this. We dressed up as our characters and prepared our favorite special foods. The murderer was a complete surprise to everyone and all the suspects had a motive and an opportunity. If you ever played CLUE as a kid you will love this.
5,Awesome!,"This was so much fun! We enjoyed the story very much. I'm not sure why there are even negative reviews -- I think if you don't have a fun crowd to play, any of these murder mystery parties can a bore. Buying decorations helps out a lot and especially dressing in character. I especially like the character description for each -- very detailed, so you have a great idea of what you should look like. I definitely recommend this for a group of friends who are fun and goofy."
4,Good start,"It was a good start. We had never done a murder mystery, so it was a litter scattered and confusing as a first game I assumed would be. It took me a while to figure out the two optional characters had questions or actions to do, but the others didn't have responses to those actions and left them a little confused and didn't think they had to respond. It is set out pretty well, but be sure to explain a few times the directions. I didn't play a role as the host and found it easier b/c I looked through all of the scripts, but harder to follow along with who didn't do what yet."
3,Alot of fun!,"We used this and it was a good time, pretty traditional and similar to the other ""murder mystery parties"" but it was advertised with two solutions and only came with one. Disappointing as I have several groups of friends and it would have been more fun for me if the repeat plays would be different."
3,directions confusing,Played it with our friends in costume and with homemade scenery. Preparing for it was fun but the directions and the game itself is quite confusing.
1,Too confusing,Too confusing...not spontaneous enough....directions interfered with the spontaneity of the evening. Would not purchase again.
3,A Taste for Wine and Murder,"Although this murder mystery game set made for a fun evening with friends, it was rather confusing. I recommend reading the first dialogue so that you can get a feel for it, and explain it better to your guests. Also, please let your guests know that if their character booklet says anything about a ""clue #x"" at any point, have them let the rest know. The ""clue"" booklets are vital to determining the murderer[ess]. Overall, take time to decide what to say to your guests when explaining how the game runs, and make sure that you don't leave anything out of the explanation."
5,Wine & Murder Evening,"We purchased this product to host our first murder mystery dinner party. None of the 8 of us had previously participated in one of these games. It was fabulous. Great information, great characters (all 8 of us dressed in costume), interesting plot. I even made wine labels for empty bottles to use as decor to coordinate with the theme of the evening. We can't wait to host another one in the near future. I highly recommend this game, but we didn't use the complicated menus; we chose to serve appetizers, salad, lasagne & cheesecake for dessert."
4,Fun for any occasion!,"We played A Taste for Wine and Murder on New Years Eve. We all had a fantastic time. The game is well organized with 3 different menu suggestions with shopping lists and recipes. The clues were well laid out and the costume suggestions helped us all be even more creative. Everyone really got into their character, which is a must for a successful murder mystery party. The game took about 3 hours to complete which was perfect to pass the time on New Years Eve. Only two of us guessed who the murder was in the end. The game was even fun for the non-suspects (Bud Wizer and Bonny Lass) even though we didn't have any secrets to reveal. The only thing that could have been improved was the CD - it was a little cheezy and still referred to itself as a casset tape (that could be updated!). This is the 4th murder party we've done and I'd say overall it was a success. If you've never done a Murder Mystery Party - I would HIGHLY recommend trying one."
5,Good extension antenna cable for Sirius receivers,This was a good buy - easy to install and well made. A good option for those who want or need to have their receiver a good distance from where their antenna is located.
5,Sirius Cable,"replaced a cable my dog chewed, this was just as good as the sirus model from best buy and nearly half the cost."
1,Not waterproof,"There is an amplifier at the outside end of this cable. The compartment totally filled up with water after a few rain storms. I get no signal at all because of water damage. I had the connector oriented correctly accourding to the instructions, but it still filled with water. The lid eventually fell off...I'm going to buy another cable because I need it. This time, I will seal the amplifier box with silicon glue. You should do the same thing before it rains."
5,Don't forget the Cable!!!,"Don't forget this extension cable for Sirius! As most people find out, you need to place the antenna outside for a good solid signal that lasts. With this 50 foot extension you'll be able to put it just about anywhere, plus you can hook TWO of them together to give you a total of 120 feet (50 + 50 +20 on antenna) without loss of signal.Plan ahead and know if you'll need the extension. Many go and put the money into the Sirius receiver, boombox or home kit and get all ready to hook it up only to find out they need more wire. And not just any wire wil work!I have one myself going from outside the window through one room down into my bedroom where my boombox is. Without this cable I'd be using the Sirius in the attic! Most people fine the need for one or two of these cables, and watch out as they're often hard to find in stock as they sell fast!"
3,outdoor extension,"The extension works well, but outdoors, it needs to be protected from the elements, or it shorts out!"
1,On my 3rd cable in 20 momths!,"Warning: Stay away from this Terk SIR-EXT50 extension cable, I've had to purchase 3, thats right 3 cables in 20 months.After the 1st died (9 months) I brought it back to Best Buy for an exchange. Was told I must exchange with Terk. Returned to Terk by certified mail, never received response or exchange Terk does not back this product up. Went to Best Buy & purchesed another, died yesterday after only 10 months of use. Now I'm on my way to Radio Shack to try out the MONSTER sirius 50ft Extension Cable. Wish ME Luck"
4,A must with the antenna,Easy to connect and just the right length. It's a must when you buy the Sirius Antenna. Cable is pretty kink free and ends are easy to connect.
1,extension did not work,This did not work with my Sirius boombox. The end that connects to the boombox does not fit property to establish a connection. I returned it.
3,Terk SIR-EXT50 Indoor/Outdoor Extension Kit,"Paired this up with the Terk outdoor antenna. Cable is ok, but a bit too inflexible as it is easy to potentially crimp it. I also really do not like the plug that it uses to join itself to the antenna - it seems very insecure and likely to separate from the male joiner, yielding a short in the line over time. It should have some type of positive locking mechanism like threads to guard against this almost certain occurrence. In short, it works, but for how long remains to be seen."
2,Read about these potential pitfalls before buying,I have two gripes about this product.1. The cover for where the two wires meet is designed to work with a straight male cable plug. My Siruis came with a 90 degree male plus which makes the cover useless which means I will have to jury rig some cover for it to keep the rain/snow out of it.2. The wire is the thickness of a coaxial cable which was much thicker than my satellite wire. I have my satellite wire stuck under the molding of my window but that is impossible with a wire this thick so I am not even using the extension.With all of that said though it did work as advertised with no loss in sound quality.
3,More information would have been nice,"It would have been nice to know in advance that this product had a straight line connector, rather than an 90 degree elbow-type connector. Since the radio I have accepts only an elbow-type connector, this ""extension cord"" doesn't really fit."
4,Once I got a good one..it worked fine.,What can you say about a piece of wire? The first one sent to me didn't work at all...it was defective. They quickly sent me a new one that has to date worked fine.
1,Connector does not fit,The connector on the antennae is not the same as on my sirius unit. It does not say this on the Amazon web site. There is no phone number or link to ask anyone.
5,Terk 50' outdoor extension antena (Sirius),"I was getting so frustrated losing my signal to my Sirius Sportster until I purchased the Trek 50' extension antena. I moved and mounted the antena to my roof and now it works great. I now have 7 to 10 bars instead of the 3 I used to have, I strongly recomend this purchase."
5,Makes killing flies fun,"Sure wish they had invented this when I was a kid. User has to be coordinated, the flies seem to know what it is. Very cool when it zaps a fly, you hear an snap and the fly is stunned below, Then you have to finish off the fly. Great for mosquitos."
1,Useless,"I used it for a toilet and even though the problem ended up being the toilet itself, I would not buy this product again. In fact, I gave it back to Canadian Tire. I tried once and got emptied.If the plunger wont unclog the toilet, I seriously doubt this thing will do the job. And, for $20, it is way to expensive"
3,problem installing,"I researched every car seat, found this the best, went and looked at them all and bought this one. I liked the side impact protection and it looked like a sturdy seat.It did not fit in my 2000 Chevy Tahoe. Specifically, one hook - the outside grey latch (not latch system)that hooks onto the seatbelt near the door unhooks if you push on it at all.We returned this and bought two britax marathons -both fit and work fine. I would skip this Boulevard and buy the tried and true marathon, which fits just fine without latch."
3,Sacrificing Comfort and Ease for Safety?,"I have a honda sedan. I could not see out of my rear view mirror with the seat in the middle, we had to reinstall in the passenger seat. We are still rearfacing and I find it very hard to get the baby in the seat because the buckle between her legs always falls underneath her so I have to lift her up to get it out. Also the fabric is not soft and the buckle is so low that it crosses over her thighs with no soft cover on the straps and is extremely hard to buckle. I assume that I am sacrificing her comfort in the name of safety. Do all the 5 point clasps put the straps over the infants thighs?"
4,Baby loves it,"Like the other reviews, my baby loves this seat - Falls asleep in it within 5 minutes, no matter what. She outgrew our infant snugride and I was on the hunt for the next size up. My first purchase was an evenflo ($100), but I have a tahoe with the captains chairs in the second row. Installed in the rear facing position, I couldn't adjust the knobs for the harness tighten and release. I returned it and looked at the other seats and reluctantly spent the $300 for the Boulevard. Very expensive, but TOTALLY worth it. Very sturdy and safe and comfortable and it goes up to 65 pounds when the other comparable seats go to 40. The best feature is that you can adjust the height of the harness with a knob right on the seat without having to remove it from the car and re-route the belts like other brands. I just wish it had the level indicator like the snugrides do so you know it's installed properly."
3,Crotch Strap Problems........,"I bought this carseat for my 4 month old who is 18 lbs. 26 1/2"". He is bigger for his age, but keep in mind that this car seat is supposed to hold children up to 65 lbs............... The crotch strap is a real problem. I even removed the pad that goes around the crotch strap and it's still a problem. He sits nearly on top of the strap and it's difficult to get it buckled. It needs to be moved up (toward the edge of the seat) about 2"" and it needs to be about 2"" longer and it would be perfect. I even looked into replacing the crotch strap thinking maybe Britax would make a replacement one or something. No such luck. I don't mind spending $300 on a seat, but this one is going back. We had better luck fitting him in the Decathalon as the strap is adjustable. I hope Britax fixes this problem.........Other than that it is a wonderful, awesome, safe seat."
3,"very advanced, detailed","Don't expect this book to be as approachable as some of the same author's general books on chess. I gave it three stars not because of the quality of the book, but because few players would be willing to hang in there with the huge number of variations presented. Wish the author had been a little less comprehensive and a little more generous with his commentary.Only for the dedicated!"
4,Great read,"I've read many of this author's books and I would have to say that this book was among the better ones. There is many stories in here that will catch your interest. The stories weave history and ghost in a spectacular book. It covers everything from the spitilist to the horrible croglin vampire that will make you afraid of the things that go bump in the night. There is also ghost stories about other authors from Edger Allen Poe to Charels Dikens. There is also wierd happenings that were reported in old newspapers that say everything from flying frogs to half alligator half human creatures. This book is diveded into small parts so it will keep your interest and is easy to pick up. I believe that this would be a perfect book for teenager, such as myself, to adults. So step into the victorian age and see some ghost."
4,Close to the real facts,"This version of the Night Stalker remains close and true to actual facts during the police investigation and capture of Richard Ramirez (aka the Night Stalker). This movie was originally made for TV so some of the violence and language are watered down, but still worth watching. If you want some more insight then you should check out the book about Richard Ramirez by Philip Carlo. There are no extras on this DVD such as commentary or interviews with the real police or Night Stalker but again still worth the watch. It is reported that Ramirez himself watched this movie from prison and was impressed with it."
1,Boring!,"This has got to be the worst movie I had ever seen in my life! Do yourself a favor and save your money. The acting was horrible, the story was horrible, just everything about this movie was HORRIBLE!"
3,Nice wallet,Danzig - Skull Leather WalletNice wallet but I think that the leather and the lining are a bit cheap. But it's a good price for that kind of wallet.
4,Boot Rack,Would like to see it made of a little heavier metal and the boot spacing wider. I use mine for hanging multiple pairs of waders and the additional width would help spread them apart.
4,"Mouse bridge works fine, a bit pricey","Bridge works fine, happy with it, costs a lot for what's really just a piece of plastic"
5,Great tool for character building in your young one!,"As a teacher, I look for books that will help to illustrate the value of character building to use in my classroom. The Gigantic Little Hero stresses the importance of perseverance, an important trait for any young person to learn. The illustrations are creative and colorful, helping to stress the underlying meaning. I would recommend this delightful book to anyone - parents, teachers, young and old alike!"
4,For those with an older Mac Laptop needing an AC adapter,"This one will do just fine. It doesn't look as sleek as the round disk that came with the original Apple G3 Powerbook for which I needed a replacement cord, but try finding an OEM version of one of those! There's not much to say about this adapter except that it works! And at a much better price than anything OEM by Apple. If you are trying to keep an old laptop alive or need a second power adapter, this will fit the bill."
2,Still Bif...but could Be Better,"Miss Naked's newest album, which includes a conventional cover of Metallica's ""Nothing Else Matters,"" does continue to represent the standard combination of pop/metal that her fans have easily adapted to, yet the record refuses to expand musically.With tracks that sound all too familiar in the sense of an edgier Tragic Kingdom, Bif could easily expose more lyrically yet still obtain her credibility as a hard-rock singer/songwriter.FOR MORE OF THE REVIEW..CLICK HERE[...]"
4,A great Shakti Sampler,"Clocking in at 3 hours, this dvd is packed with performance footage and interviews. It features a 60-minute documentary ""Timeless"" on the band, starting from the early 70's. John and Zakir speak about their beginnings, their era with L.Shankar and T.H. Vinayakram. Then you get 45 minutes of sound check footage with Remember Shakti from Paris 2004, as well as 55 minutes of the concert from Mumbai 2000. Also includes 2 Live Concerts--the original band from 1976 (Montreux Jazz Festival) as well as Montreux Jazz 2004. Plus, a huge bonus: clips from the Mahavishnu Orchestra at my alma mater -- just four years before I got there, bummer-- Syracuse University, NY, 1972 outside gig at Skytop (Very rare but you can find the entire 45 min. performance-- with Ravi Shankar warming up the MO-- on YouTube now). Highly recommended for all McLaughlin and MO fans."
4,Incredible!,"While at first this may seem ""out there"" if you just let go of ""your idea"" of what music is, your mind/body will soak it up like a sponge. It is so amazing what talented musicians can do...and being able to see them perform plus being able to see all the different instruments makes this a truly enjoyable experience."
5,IT'S ONLY ME BUT:,"BRATT IS GREAT. SHOW'S OFF HIS 6-PACK ABS AND TALENT WELL. JENNIFER BEALS HAS AN UNCREDITED ROLE NEXT TO BRATT. ASSENTE IS SO SO. A NOT SOGOOD STORY, BUT KEEPS YOU WATCHING. JM"
2,Menacing accordion music!,"This is the only movie I know in which the villain's presence is indicated by--you guessed it--menacing accordion music.Armand Assante plays an evil Frenchman who lusts for women&jewels;,and who's out to betray the boyish Benjamin Bratt.Armand Assante makes advances on Bratt's girlfriend,suggesting a menage a trois involving him and his wife.To the tune of menacing accordion music,of course (sorry,such eeevil accordion music isn't on Putumayo's hit compilation ""French Cafe"")There's murder,intrigue,and lots of deep sea diving.And menacing accordion music."
5,I agree - this stuff is wonderful. Better than expected!,"Hard to believe getting all worked up over a carpet cleaner. But I have never had much luck getting any carpet cleaner to work well. This one actually does, and does it super fast and easy. Buy this you can't go wrong. I agree with all the others; that this is a standout product in it's field. THIS IS THE ONLY CARPET CLEANER TO BUY!"
5,"The absolute best carpet cleaner on the market, a miracle","Folex is the very best carpet cleaner you can get. It works fast, actually it works right before your eyes as you spray it onto the carpet. Spots disappear right then and there, and for good. For really tough stains, I would let it dry and then try some more the following day. I hope they never discontinue this, it has saved us many, many times from having to pay for a new carpet. God bless the guys that invented Folex!"
5,This stuff is amazing,"We have a large family room carpeted with burber that is extremely light in color. Never should have bought such light carpet with 3 cats that stay in all the time and seem to throw up quite a number of hairballs. Some terrible stains have been made on that carpet, but this stain remover really does the job of removing the stains. It has eliminated stains that Stanley Steemer left behind. Great product."
5,Great product.,I've used on both home and autmotive carpet. Works great. Much cheaper at Home Depot though. $5.xx for the Giant size 36 fl. oz.
3,Great cleaner IF;,"I had good luck and bad luck with the product. I urge you to absolutley test an area before using. My medimu gray carpet was very discolored after using this product (without pre-testing); same with a light gray throw rug; however, it worked great on a beige carpet and multi-colored throw rug."
2,Like all the rest,"Using this on pet and food stains, this cleaner doesn't really work any better or worse than others I've tried. Normally I wouldn't buy anything that says it is ""Instant"", but this had such good reviews. Stick to the cheaper brands from your local store.Update 9/28/12: I just used up the last of the bottle, and I'm still totally unimpressed, will not buy again. And yes, I followed the directions. I also tried the product on various types of carpet."
4,Folex works magically,"I used this product at my daughter's house to clean up dog pee. Amazingly the process was quick and easy with a wonderful result--no spot at all. So I came home and ordered a bottle of Folex for myself from Amazon. Haven't used it yet, but I'm sure I will since we have 2 dogs."
3,pet urine stains,"Despite all the wonderful reviews for this product, it didn't work as I had hoped on old pet urine stains. With a lot of scrubbing, some of the yellow stain came out, but not as I expected. Too bad. I'll try it on more recent stains and see if it helps."
2,YUCKY CARPET CLEANER,Didn't work for me (our dog)! It did not clean the carpet or remove the stains. I will keep trying other products.
4,this is magic,"It cleaned most of the spot although not all of them. I am satisfied with this product, and hope it can do more."
3,"Product good, service not","I ordered two bottles of this product which I had ordered before & was very satisfied with. My total order was about $20.98. The shipment was damaged & USP would not deliver it and returned it. I asked for a replacement, but rather than replace my product they credited my account just $8.29! Less than half of what I was paying. I am extremely disastified with the results of this order and the way it was handled. I'm a Prime member so shipping was FREE. I should have been credited the full $20.98 or sent two new undamaged bottles."
1,Did not remove ink from carpet,I must admit that I cannot believe how some of the reviews are so positive and it simply did not work for me at all. I had an ink stain on a carpet and it barely made a difference. It says the stain will disappear before your eyes. It did not. My wife and I struggled with the stain for days and it did nothing.
2,no good for coffee,I had so many review written about the amazing product for coffee stains...FOLEX did not do a thing. what a waste of money
3,Works but it's not magic,I recently bought this to remove stains from my upholstered kitchen chairs. It did remove some stains but there was a lot it couldn't get rid of. Not a miracle product but works much better than a lot of other products out there.
4,very good result,"I tried this on my Toyota 2008 RAV4, with some stain on backseat from last winter. After cleaning 2 times, most stain are removed, although there is some light stain left, overall it looks good. My suggestion is to use multiple clean cloth and change frequently. As each cloth gets dirty very easily. After the cloth got dirty, cleaning result is not that good. Next time I will try it on carpet. If this product has a bigger package, like one gallon refill, that will be great."
3,it's ok but could be better,it didn't clean the stains i had i had to buy a carpet cleaner then use it but it still did not get all the stain
5,The BEST carpet cleaner,"This is the hands down, all time, best carpet cleaner; no questions asked. I regularly clean my carpets with my Hoover Steam Vac and Bissell Little Green Clean Machine. I have used all types of Hoover, Bissell, and Oxy Clean detergents. Folex works so well with these machines. For spot clean up, blotting on any type of stain always has great results. The one thing I notice about Folex that is different from other cleaners is that after you use it, there is no residue that attracts new dirt. GET IT~!"
1,Not worth the money,What a waste of money. Someone told me that they have pets who make a huge mess and that this is the only product that works. I had no success with it at all. Resolve works much better for me.
2,Didn't work at all for me.,"I had a stain to remove from my tan carpet consisting of crystal lite, unfortunately red, but since that is water based, I didn't think it should be so hard to remove. I tried six different cleaners, and the Folex was my last chance. It was as if I had sprayed water on the carpet. I was totally not impressed. It was a total waste of money."
1,i cant,the bottle was open in the sealed package and totally leaked out before i ever got a chance to use it. obviously they dont check it before its packaged/shipped so not wasting my money again
2,I'm really disappointed.,"I searched the internet last night for the best carpet spot remover. By FAR the best rated product I could find was this. People raved about it! I was sold. I went to Home Depot bright and early this morning and bought a huge jug for 17$. I rent an old apartment with off white carpet. I also have small children and a dog. Basically, I have no shortage fo stains and I was SO SURE this would work after reading all the reviews. I don't know what the deal is or why this seems to work for everyone but me, but honestly it hasn't gotten anything up. New or old stains, nothing. Old urine spots, a strawberry milk stain, chocolate... Even random old spots from before I moved in.. It hasn't seemed to effect any of them. Certainly didn't disappear before my eyes. The carpet around whatever spot I treat does look super clean after, but the spot remains. Bummer."
1,How did this get HIGH reviews?!,"After reading the many highly rated reviews and also reading the less than high reviews, I decided to try it for myself. I just tried it on my various stains on my tan carpet and to my dismay it didn't touch but maybe one. I am HIGHLY disappointed with this product. There was no ""magic"" disappearing stains before my eyes or fading for that matter. I felt like I was spraying water all over my carpet. If your like me and read the reviews and say well the good outway the bad trust me don't bother. I too figured what do I have to lose? Well you have to lose the gas for driving to the store or by having someone deliver it, your money and your time. Complete waste...I hope this review saves someone the trouble.P.S. If I could give it a zero I would."
2,disappointment,"I have two bad stains from soya sauce on my carpet , after reading the reviews on this product I went for it - result NADAno change ,waste of money"
5,AMAZING PRODUCT...USE COMMON SENSE,This product is amazing. I had an ink stain on my light blue carpet. The kids not only ran over the pen with the computer chair but kept running it over the stain until it was really ground in. Tried everything on it. About 6 months later I found this product and sprayed it on heavily and just left it for about 10 mins. Stain was completely gone. I read the reviews about stains coming back after a few weeks and found that this happens when the stain is ground in to the carpet backing. Allowing the product to soak through and then using paper towels to pat heavily until the stain is lifted and most of moisture removed prevents the stain from coming back. I did have a few come back and just used this method and had no repeats of stains coming back. Have even used this on laundry items and furniture. Will never be without it.
4,Stain Remover,I detail cars every week in my garage. This thing does remove most of the stains with some scrubbing. Overall good product.
5,The Best Spot Remover EVER!,"Folex is the very best at removing almost any stain from any fabric. It removed dried on 2-day old blood from an expensive Egyptian Cotton pillowcase so easily it was hard to believe. I just sprayed it on, rubbed it together and then sprayed it again. I did laundry about an hour later and there was no trace of the stain. I've used it to get fresh strawberry stains out of a white cotton blouse. I even removed permanent marker from a white Duvet. You just let it sit after rubbing it in and when you come back, the stain is gone. This stuff is a miracle. YOU SHOULD BUY IT!!!"
4,Good on light food stains & dirt marks,"I've used up over half a bottle of this since I bought it here a few months ago. It does a good job on spot stains. You just have to follow the directions and scrub the area where you've just sprayed. I use a hand-sized scrub brush and put some muscle into it and can scrub clean a square foot of carpet in about 2-3 minutes.Keep in mind: This is not going to make a really dirty carpet look clean again. For that, you'll need to go rent a steamer and steam clean the carpets. But if you just have a few spots that need to be taken up, this is a very good product."
5,Miracle worker!!!,"Six years ago, some workmen tracked grease on the carpet of our brand-new home. We hadn't even moved in yet and I was ready to cry. I found Folex at Home Depot and decided to give it a try...the grease stains literally disappeared after I sprayed and rubbed with my finger. Needless to say, I was sold. Fast-forward to six years and two kids later and I still use Folex for everything. If a kid can make a stain, Folex can take it out. I have safely used this on upholstery, carpet, clothing, and it works great in the car. We recently bought an old beater of a car and I went to work on the interior with a couple of towels and my trusty Folex and it now looks great. I have recommended it to tons of friends with kids and I think I might start giving it as a baby shower gift...."
1,It didn't work for me.,"I had coffee stain on my carpet and it didn't remove it as promised. This was the only reason I ordered the product, I'm disappointed."
5,Amazing product,This stuff really works. I used it on carbon stains I've had for a couple of years on cream carpeting from the door hinges and it got it up. Also used it on some older stains that were stubborn and they came up like magic. Wish I had found this years ago.
5,Perhaps the most important story in medicine today,"Of all the important investigation that Christopher Bird performed during his career, The Life and Trials of Gaston Naessens is probably his most important work. I first became aware of Bird's book in 1990, and I have bought numerous copies over the years to give them to cancer and AIDS patients. His book is not a monumental piece of scholarship, but it tells one more story about what happens to medical pioneers. I have taken Bird's work much further, and I write at length about Naessens and the professional lineage that he is a marvelous part of. The story of Naessens work is probably the most important one in medicine today."
3,A frightening look into the world of cancer research,"This book lends a deep insight into the search for new medicine and the troubling barriers preventing cures we could all use. Gaston Naessens is a man who has discovered a promising new drug that cures cancer in many people. His attempts at making that drug available for all cancer patients leads to his eventual persecution and a lifetime of frustration. Cancer patients everywhere will want to contact this man. Others will wonder what they can do to battle the endless conglomerate of a profit oriented medical world. I found this book interesting, but at times the author gets lost in minute detail and facts that leave the reader a little confused."
1,"Not soft, product different than picture","The weights I received looked very similar to the picture yet they were not ""soft"" as advertised.1. The edges were different, it was only sewn at both edges.2. Strap was hard and thin possibly made of a hard plastic.3. Weights were hard and stiff making it difficult to strap on your ankles.It was difficult to walk/run and almost got blisters. I tried wearing them above my pants yet they still hurt. Couln't stand it thefore I return them. I do own others weights/brand much more comftable and ""soft""."
3,"Comfortable, but","Like most cheaper wrist weights, they are difficult to keep cleaning and from smelling because you can't remove the weights to wash. Rinsing them out or washing by hand creates a bit of a mess as the items inside for weight leak brown color when wet.I'm a man and when I put these at the tightest with the straps, they do not stay on my wrists, I have to push them up my arms a bit. Obviously made for those who are more obese.However, they are very very comfortable (soft) and have held up well with many long distance runs."
2,False advertising,"I was under the impression that they were 3 lbs. each, instead of 1.5 lbs. I was sorely mistaken. A waste of time and money."
1,Not made for small people,"I am a female with a small frame and I bought these to use as wrist weights, but the velco will not fit tightly enough around my wrists to hold them still and I cannot use them."
4,Purchase for the Illustrations,"The ""Masters of Art"" series of books were originally published in Italy in the 1980's. These books are beautiful examples of the Italian approach to illustrating children's books. Italian illustrators love highly detailed images that are rich in historical detail. They love playing with perspective and are virtuosos of architectural detail. The story does a workman like job of describing Leonardo's life and his artisitic achievements. There is plenty of detail but the narrative lacks warmth. Leonardo the man is absent from this book. Having said this, the illustrations are amazing and make this book a good purchase. Recommended."
5,Insights into various aspects of Sufism,"Sufism presents a survey of the mystics of Islam, republishing a work which appeared in London in 1950, providing insights into various aspects of Sufism and considering the lives of its mystics. An excellent introduction to both the founders of Sufism and its basic foundations."
3,A fun idea for a dinner party,"Rather than prepare the suggested menu, everyone was assigned a dish with an Italian theme, that took alot of work off of the hostess. We all dressed in costume. Some people had real problems translating the third person descriptions into first person. If anyone wears reading glasses, make sure that they bring them! Overall, we had a great time, and are planning another one, looking for the Lethal Luau version for next time."
2,Needs better directions,this game was not as much fun as the other murder mystery we have played. mostly due to lack of explicit instructions as to when to play the CD and when the players were to interview each other.
4,Fun Times,"I've never done a game like this before, so the instructions and game play was hard to understand at first, but we made due and had fun anyways."
4,"Fun for adults, not approproate for 12 yr. olds.","I used this for my daughters 12th birthday party and I had to change quite a bit to make it appropriate for her age. The girls had a lot of fun, but were unable to solve the mystery in the end. I reccommend this game for adults."
4,Wonderful!,"This is the 3rd Murder Mystery I have purchased and its the best one yet! Very good plot with lots of twists and turns. Make sure to include people who are fun and can improvise. This game requires all 8 people to participate, unlike others that can have only 6 participate. We had extra people and they were able to join in the fun too. As always, includes great recipes, decoration suggestions, and invitations. Also came with audio CD, but we didn't use it and I don't think we missed anything. Highly suggest this one!"
4,Great fun - even for teenager level player,"I bought this game with a little trepidation after reading the review of the other mom who bought it for a young teen's party - but at 14 and 15 our girls were easily able to navigate the scripts and innuendo involved in playing. They dressed to the nines and had a great time playing. It doesn't hurt, if you're using this with teens, to have one adult who has reviewed everything, including the solution, to assign roles by personality, and facilitate play. I would encourage the facilitator to have people up and mingling about, rather than letting people gravitate to seating...it flows better. Overall a very fun game and easily appropriate for 14 and up. I can imagine adults would be a riot in this!"
5,Gives good insight into Evita's inner life.,"This book provides the emotional component that all other books about Evita lack. Yes, all the other books can give you endless detail about Eva's life, but none leave you feeling like you've just met Evita. For an insight into what went on in the heart and mind of this incredible woman, I highly recommend this book!"
3,Meh,"I bought this book for school for my Mythology in Literature class and it was very well written (the parts of the tablet that could be read), but I'm not a fan of the story itself. It just didn't do it for me. My teacher read us parts of it and made it much more interesting, but that's just because he was so excited about it. I'm sure lovers of ancient history would love this story, though. Just not my cup of tea."
4,Solid Translation,I strongly suggest reading this book before reading any others. It is excellently translated and the notes are so detailed. Gardner knows what he's doing.
1,Run from this flop,"I love a good low budget horror movie. I can usually find something decent about most of them. This one has got me stumped for anything good to say. A few of the actresses were cute and could act on a fifth grade level. The story was laughable, the sets were unsed store rooms with no trying to disguise them and the dilogue was being read off cuecards, or so it seemed.The biggest problem was that the main antagonist was added after the movie was shot. You never see her with any other actor, save one, and the one is also never with the others. It shows this girl, cuts to a reaction to what she says or does, but never on camara at the same time. They would have been better off to leave her out completely. It is like she was the girl friend of the director or she was blackmailing him to get her in this.Please, do yourself a favor and forget this movie even exists."
2,Lacking,Only buy this one if you need to own all things zombie related. I gave it 2 stars for effort and extra feature.
1,The Dorm Wasn't The Only Thing That Was Dead,"One of the first rules for a good movie is that the movie must be at least one hour and twenty-five minutes long. This movie was just over one hour. Oh, it also stunk. The acting could have been better, but I have seen worse. The dead people looked as if all they needed was a week's sleep and a trip to a salon or maybe even a saloon. I loved the way it began, but it wend downhill after that. I think a better story could have been written around the first two victims and the ""goth"" girl. The prima-dona was a bit too sterotypical. The story was not the worst, but the acting and special affects did not live up to the story. I have seen worse, but this movie was one of the better of the worst. Don't buy. Don't rent. Wait for someone to throw theirs out and rummage through their garbage."
1,terrible,"I agree with every thing reb2014 said the movie is horrible...the acting sucks, and looks like this mess was shot with a camcorder.....I should have known it was bad when I ordered it off here, and never seen it at the store...no story line....no plot, just a hot mess....and the music didn't even fit.....horrible, save your money....rent Dead In The Water(2007)...much better"
3,dragon destiny,"I feel this continuation of the original series left a lot to be desired, the new characters were ok, but the story line was sort of drawn out & bland."
4,Positive,"This has some of Vikki Carr's smaller Spanish hits, plus some outstanding album cuts. It's an outstanding collection, but probably not the one to start with if you're new to the Carr sound."
4,Spanish music,My mom had Viki Carr records when I was growing up. I was a bit nostalgic one day and decided to get some Vikki Carr CD's for both my mom and myself. We are both enjoying them a lot.
4,fits perfectly,"We finally needed to replace our 25 yr old toilet seat and were worried that we wouldn't be able to match the pale yellow color. So, we were pleasantly surprised that the 'sunlight' color from Kohler matched! The toilet seat fits perfectly and doesn't slam. My only concern is that it FEELS insubstantial; it'll probably hold up just fine, but i feel as though if i weighed a hundred pounds more, the plastic might crack."
2,Quick Release?,"I was looking for a toilet seat that had a substantial feel, was well constructed and of good quality. I trusted the Kohler name and expected that the higher price would indicate a better product. Not so. This particular model has a ketchy feature that we didn't expect to find: Quick Release. It's hinges snap into place, and supposedly snap out of place for cleaning. I really wasn't in the market for a removeable toilet seat.Now that I have one, I feel compelled to snap it off for cleaning, only I can't. The ""quick release"" hinges are just loose enough to allow for seat shifting room (feeling like you're falling off the throne when you sit down) but not loose enough to easily remove. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.I recommend avoiding this product."
1,So not worth the money,"This toilet seat is a replacement for the original. The original is 13 yrs old, not bad. On the new one they changed the way it attaches to the bowl. Plastic screws go into plastic nuts and then a plastic cap is snapped over the top to hold the seat on and in place. The plastic snap on covers that are suppose to hold everything in place do not stay snapped on. Therefore the toilet seat moves and does not stay in place. $88.00 is alot of money for a piece of crap for a craper. Totally dissifiedDavid S"
4,It fits my toilet and works,"I am impressed by the fact that a toilet seat can have so many opinions. This seat works, supports the body, and is simple to install. The price on Amazon is better than from Kohler.It's not padded, it's not warm, it isn't slow to close, but it covers the bowel and this one isn't cracked like the one it replaced."
4,For the Most Part What I Wanted,I enjoy having a toilet seat that is coordinated with the rest of my bathroom. I just wish that it had been soft. I had to get used to sitting on a hard seat. This is a bummer at night when you are half asleep.
2,Change in design needed,"I have had this style Kohler toilet seat before, but have been disappointed with this batch. I ordered seat replacements for 2 toilets and one seems to be satisfactory and the other is problematic. For some unknown reason, Kohler designers felt compelled to change the attaching ""hardware"" to a sub-standard design using plastic bolts and plastic wing nuts. One of the bolts will not tighten properly and the seat loosens constantly. In this case, spending this kind of money on a Kohler product was not worth it at all. I am very frustrated with this change of design."
5,Chip resistant plastic vs. wood,"I'd gone through a lot of Home Depot Bemis wooden seats. Wood chips easily. Although the Bemis seats are comfortable and come in many decorations, they're not worth throwing away the money. Although one reviewer remarks that a cold plastic seat is cold in the middle of the night, I'd put up with that instead of the throw-away wooden seats.I just ordered this product on PlumberSurplus for $47.44. Free shipping. Plus tax, the whole order came to 51.35. Cheaper than Amazon! Although it hasn't arrived yet, am giving it lots of stars because ANYTHING is 100% better than Bemis wooden toilet seats. If I have any problems with it, will give another review."
2,Ff,Not great. Don't waste your time unless you really really love dogsIn which case you'll love it so go for it
3,Different take on a classic monster,"Simple, yet entertaining. Good twist, telling the story from the dogs point of view. The world would be better off if dogs ran the place."
5,awesome!!!!!!,"this book was really incredible. i'm shocked that it isn't a lot more popular. i found a lot of typo's on the kindle version. it didn't detract from the story, but they probably should be fixed. as far as the story goes, completely origional and heartwarming as well. excellent! i've wanted to read this book from the moment i saw the movie! i'm glad i wasn't disappointed!"
4,An excellent and intriguiing novel!,"Princess Charming is an intriguing novel that combines both history, romance and humour. The chracters and their relationship never cease to surprise the reader. One can not wait to discover what will occur next! I would recommend this novel to all who enjoy regency novels and Elizabeth Thorton's work."
2,This book lacked sizzle and substance.,"The story was okay...the plot was way too intense for my liking, but it was readable. I skipped over most of the blather that didn't have anything to do with the romance.There was no romantic sizzle in this book whatsoever. The love scenes were brief and absolutely no description of any kind took place.I cannot even bring myself to read another Elizabeth Thornton book. I cannot recommend this one."
2,no chemistry,"There was not chemistry between the two main characters. The storyline was completely predictable, and it lacked the passion I expect from Elizabeth Thornton."
4,Very nice for the price,"I found these speakers while looking for some speakers to compliment my Saitek 2 Illuminated keyboard. The speakers they replaced were some old Vaio speakers from my old computer. The speakers themselves look cool, and the sound they produce is decent when compared to my older computer speakers. the sub is on the boomy/bloomy side. I had an Altec xa3001 before, and I think that that sub sounded a bit better. For the fun stuff. In a dark room, these speakers do exactly what you want them to do...Glow, the multicolor effect is cool, the ""beat"" detect olny kicks in at high volume. Specs are:Satellite: 6 watts RMSSub 17 watts RMS40 hz-20khz"
1,These speakers are a JOKE!!!,These speaker if you could call them speakers BLOW and I dont mean that in a positive way! They are cheaply made but cost a fortune the sound SUCKS and the woopdidoo lights burn out!! SAVE YOUR MONEY and run from this product....Don
2,Too many missing details,"The content of this book is very disappointing. Too many details are missing. In many cases, the authors describe implementations without getting into the details of how they reached it. Because of these missing details, it is hard to understand the reasonning behind some of the trade-offs described in the book. It lacks clarity in several areas. Even with some experience in the area, I was left too many times trying to figure out what the authors meant."
2,Too Pedantic,"I ordered this book based on some of the reviews, but then returned it. It is too pedantic; it sounds like a college professor lecturing at great length to his students, with a lot of fluff. Plus the price was too steep for a book in this category - $71?I'm sticking to the excellent Kimball series of data warehousing books"
5,Sturdy Blocks!,"My son has much fun with this set of seven blocks! Stack them up, knock them down, rumble on top of them..very fun for my little guy! I add them to his other Children's Factory items and the blocks hold up well and blend right in. Very bright colors are great when teaching young children primary colors. Definitely worth the money paid for them."
3,Good but not great...,"There really isn't much wrong with this CD. The performance by Vicente is strong and the music is very well played. It's just the songs are not as good as most of Chente's work. They just don't have hooks to pull you into the listening.I did enjoy ""Motivos"" and ""Vagabundo"" will definately keep your toe tapping. But overall this is not his greatest, and it is the rest of his vast collection of outstanding recordings against which I compare this. Motivos has it's moments but falls short by ""El Rey"" standards."
5,Practical approach to OOAD with UML,"Before reading this book I read ""The Unified Modeling Language User Guide"". I can say that ""The Unified Modeling Language User Guide"" is about the theory and ""UML 2 and the Unified Process..."" is about practice.I think that both books are must for UML beginners and reference for the UML professionals.In ""UML 2 and the Unified Process.."" authors show UML in action within the Unified Process, a framework for software development. The book describes how to analyze and design a software by giving a real example. Given examples are also complete and available online.The language of the book is simple (easy to understand) and its contents is organized very well.This book gave me an insight about the UML and also introduced me to the Unified Process. I would recommend it with 5+ stars to everybody."
4,Great,This book is excellent for using the right word. It tells the difference from words that we commonly use in the wrong manner.
3,It wasn't what I thought it was.,It's a book to help you keep from mixing up words. It's for words that are closely related and are often confused.
4,Good Reference,I think this will be very helpful in my writing whenever I question what word to use in a given context. Thank you.

2,Relieved to see I'm not the only disappointed customer!,"I should have checked this showerhead out as thoroughly as I usually check things out, but I was so excited to see it at a reasonable price compared to other filtering showerheads, that I grabbed it without research.I, too, like the other reviewers have had to start looking for something else after just 5 months because the rubber rings have stretched out and no longer hold the showerhead in the holder. The showerhead is too heavy for the mount that comes with it and it keeps falling down on our heads. The showerhead makes a high pitched squealing noise that my previous shower head did not make.I have a 4 yr. old daughter and she can no longer shower ""like a big girl"" because of the potential for injury. I see that the ShowerTek company is not much help, but I'm going to E-mail them next and let them know about their inferior product. Do not waste your money on this product. You will be sorely disappointed, I'm sure!"
1,"Murder, sex and bad history","I'm, giving this book one star because that is the lowest that Amazon allows. Don't let the cat on the cover and the publisher's description of the book fool you. This book is no cozy mystery. The main character is totally unlikable and this small town a little slice of hell. If the people of the real village of Waterville, NY, want to scare away strangers, this is the book that will do it. The author also seems to have some sort of annoying ax to grind by stating more than once that the only literate 19th century women in upstate New York were two or three gangster's molls in spite of the existence of hundreds of well-known well-educated 19th century upstate New York women including Dr. Mary Walker, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Mary Mapes Dodge, and Catherine Brooks Yale. Everyone in 19th century NY wasn't a thief or murderer.The Crucible of Ferment."
1,boo,"first off, shane is not the 'last' member of the Loomis Family. I know this because my grandmother is a grand-daughter to William Loomis.The book is crappy and the myth of a treasure in Mohawk Valley is completely Bogus."
3,Just ok - battery compartment easily opened by toddler,This toy is decent for the price. My biggest gripe is that the battery compartment does not screw on. My almost 3 year old is quite capable of removing the cover and batteries. I've had to put it away for the time being because of this.
5,Great learning toy!!,"Purchased the Write & Learn for my 4 year old son to help his writing skills in a fun interactive way and have been very happy with the results! It holds his attention longer then schooling him with our books and he even uses it on his own! i also like the art function that teaches him to draw certain words. I have seen more confidence and less frustration in how he expresses himself with art now, let alone his writing has improved. Great practice for school right here and at such a value! it's worth ever penny and more and has served it's purpose so well in my opinion! :)"
5,Bought in 2008 but kids still used it,"I bought two of these in 2008 for my two younger kids. They were about to go to preschool and can tell you if these survived the test of time. Initially, my kids didn't get the concept and weren't really into even though I showed them how it worked. But the last year or so, they have really enjoyed this as they were both learning how to write and really liked it. These have been thrown around, tossed at each other (time outs shortly thereafter), stepped on and spilt on but also played with until the batteries died and in the end, they learned how to write. Very pleased with this as most toys last a year if that and then, onto the next greatest invention."
3,Toy too positive,"I have not given my daughter this toy yet, but was somewhat disappointed when I received it and played around with it. It shows you how to draw a letter or shape and then asks you to draw it. I tried drawing the letter or shape completely wrong and it still told me I did great or it was very good practice. It could at least say, ""not quite"" or ""try again"". I am afraid that whatever my daughter draws, based on the toy's feedback, she will think she drew the correct thing, when in fact she may not have."
2,Scribble echoes make writing difficult to see,"I was dissapointed in this toy. My daughter needs handwriting practice (age 6). But the toy leaves behind a lighted echo of the previous letters your child writes. After a few letters, the lines begin to blend together and the child can't see clearly what they're writing anymore. After some use (a few days), the screen begins to misread the child's writing. It's a wonderful idea but it needs some work. Without a ""clear"" screen free of echoes of previous letters - your child can't see clearly what they are writing. Which defeats the purpose of teaching them how to precisely write their letters. :(I returned ours to the store."
4,fun toy but...........,"This toy is fun for my 3 year old. It asks the child to draw letters or shapes, but no matter what he writes on the board, the voice still tells him he's done a great job. For example, if it asks you to draw a circle and you draw a square instead, it still praises you. Don't get me wrong, my 3-year-old still loves it; he doesn't care. I can't complain for $8."
4,Write and Learn Letter Review VTech,"My son likes this product, it will be very educational. The only thing I don't like is that what is written on the drawing screen is not that noticeable, but other than that a great toy."
2,Disappointed. It doesn't teach lower case letters.,"I definitely paid too much for this toy. It simply doesn't capture my 4 year-old's attention. She doesn't have the patience for it, though she said she wanted it. However, children don't like every toy, and I can accept that.However, one very legitimate gripe is that it only addresses writing capital letters. How to write lower case letters? Not even covered. For fifty+ ducks (yep I spent too much) I was expecting SO much more.Also, a backlighting feature would have been nice. My daughter took this on a long road trip. She wanted to write in the car in the dark but she couldn't see what she was doing."
3,fun for a while,I bought this for Christmas last year and it was fun for a while. I'm not too impressed with the graphics which are very crude. Invest in a Leapster. I bought one for my now 4-year-old and boy she hardly wants to put it down!
2,"Good, but good enough?","Okay - Too Little Too Late is a great song filled with reverb. Record companies shouldn't make singles with only 2 songs. They should have at least four. The cost of buying this isn't worth it. As of now, it's $4.99 new. If the album is what, maybe 12 dollars, that means 2 1/2 of these cost about the same amount as the album. That's only 6 tracks, when you can get (I think it's) 13 tracks on the album. ""Get it poppin"" is a r&b track, that sounds like it came from her first album. I'm sorry, ""Get It Poppin"" is good, but it's just not good enough for you to fork over all that cash. Not to mention shipping."
1,PC Rubbish,"What a load of absolute rubbish this book is. 200+ pages of words in attempt to deny that there be differences between racial groups. All the time, ignoring that they are attacking a book called the ""Bell Curve"". A bell curve distribution of any characteristic of any group means there is a spectrum of characteristics around the median. And that bell curves of different groups can and frequently do overlap. So, for example, if the median IQ of group A is higher than Group B, there can be members of group B with a higher IQ than members of Group A."
2,"""The problem with being politically correct.""","The Bell Curve is not ""exact science"" but well researched observations. The Bell Curve findings are eye-opening and sad.Unless the sub-cultures in America, mainly the blacks, get in step with mainstream America, the Bell Curve notion will continue to prove the observations made by the author of the The Bell Curve theory correct over and over againIt's a shame that the Bell Curve is considered racist by blacks.The black's hatred of caucasians will always blind them to the steps that they need to take for them to share in the American Dream and contribute to American society rather than being lifelong liabilities to it."
4,interesting and provacative....,"offering an alternative view to the troubles in todays lower to middle class society...the analysis of IQ versus achievement, propogation, and economic status was enlightening and true. From our perspective it seems that the troubles in todays society is due to a lowering of intelligence by virtue of the vast majority of low intellect people supported by the welfare system.....Ignorance breeds ingnorance...."
2,Half the story,"Grenier only provides half the story. He ignores a sizeable body of research on Native American warfare that suggests an Indian way of war ""waged against Indian noncombatant populations and their agricultural resources"" existed long before Europeans ever set foot on the continent. Grenier also overlooks the research on global primative warfare exemplified by Keeley, which suggests war waged on noncombatants has a long history in all societies, not just European or Indian ones. By only providing half of the story, he allows the reader to assume the worst, as all the eminent scholars quoted above certainly did. Recommend Starkey, or Malone, or Chet instead."
2,Silly premise but informative,"Grenier's overall thesis is poorly constructed and seems to pigeonhole the evidence to support his theory. The arguments come apart in the conclusion. His evidence to support a First Way of War is tenuous at best, and does nothing to explain extirpative warfare in virtually every other conflict zone throughout history.You're better off reading something else."
1,A Great Book... if you need extra wood for the winter,"I would give this book zero stars if it was possible on Amazon. Grenier attempts to give a revisionist account of the American Frontier. It is very sad that a historian of such educational 'credentials' would author such pithy work.I feel this book is on the outside of the party looking in, when it comes to true American studies. On the next attempt Grenier should at least try to join the party."
3,A Good starting place,"I got this book when my Cavalier puppy first came home. I needed a good book on basics - nothing too complex and nothing designed specifically for breeders or showing. I only wanted bird's eye views of history and genetics, etc. and this was perfect. Once I get over puppyhood and can get more involved with the breed, I will need something more involved than this, but this is an excellent place to start."
3,Predicting Coat Color,"On page 82 & 83 of the book it descibes coat color genetics. D. Caroline Coile in this book writes, ""In the case of Cavaliers, the red (R) allele is dominant to the black and tan (r) allele. However, Clare Rusbridge BVMS in a different publication writes that ""Blenheim and Rubies are recessive coat variations"". It appears that this book has coat color genetics wrong. How much of the other information within this book was not researched by D. Caroline Coile the author."
5,This CD is tha bomb.,"Hey if you want a wierd and funny CD check this one out. My Name Is is probably the best known, but check out songs 9 and 11 also."
2,Nearly unlistenable,"I had great hope for this DVD based on its description and the generally positive reviews. But wow, what a disappointment due to the poor audio. I could only make it through about 3 songs, then I just had to turn it off, the sound was bad, bad. Unfortunate as the show itself looked promising, I just couldn't listen to it. I tinkered a bit, double-checking my system, and trying all of the audio options on the DVD. I found that the 5.1 mix and the stereo mix were nearly the same, as the 5.1 mix did not use the center channel at all, and barely used the surrounds & LFE. Seriously, without looking to see which was playing, you wouldn't be able to tell the two apart. Even worse though, is that the sound that did come out was poor. As in tinny, compressed, lifeless. I don't know if I've described it right, all I know is that I had to turn it off."
4,Styx -The Grand Illusion,"A great concert indeed. Actually, this is incredibly well produced considering it was done in an arena and not on a soundstage. If I have a complaint, it is that there is no ""center"" channel sound in the Dolby Digital-5.1 mode. There is ""center"" channel in Dolby Pro Logic, but to be honest ""That Sucks"". AC-3 is the only way to go. If anyone has ""center"" channel sound in Dolby Digital, please let me know. I may have have a DVD with a glitch..."
5,Very Good DVD,"I really enjoyed this DVD. Some scenes were a little dark, but hey, that's what concerts are all about. If you have ever been to a concert, they never have all the lights up, right? I have been a Styx fan for a long time and all of their hits are on the disc. If you like Styx, BUY IT, I think you will like it too."
2,Poor fidelity,"Potential for a great DVD concert, but like so many others out there, they fell flat on their face when it came to the recording quality.If you like monotone, flat leveled music with no definition or separation of highs and lows, and vocal and instrumental, you'll enjoy this. No solos stand out...in fact, nothing stands out.My advice...watch the concert, play a cd with another system.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3,Good Video IF.......,"Good Styx video if you can stomach Dennis DeYoung. This video is pretty much Dennis trying to convince everybody that he IS Styx. He pretty much takes credit for the band's success during the intro to ""Lady"" and acts as if without him Shaw and Young and Panozzo would all be flipping burgers. DeYoung is a cornball the whole time, waving his fist, pumping his arms, making faces at the camera. It's a good laugh really. Too bad the band's music had to take a backseat to this man's ego."
2,Posers!,"before I bounce this thing, ""listening"" to styx has always been one of my fav listens. Studio work is killer. live, I guess I am glad I missed them live. POSERSGeeeez, I thought I bought a Night Ranger bubble gum band dvd by mistakeJames ""J.Y."" Young ( Poser ) , one of the worst ones I have ever seenTommy Shaw, good looking man, great singer, but still, ( Poser )Dennis De Young, one of the best voices around, still for concerts, ( Poser )Bass player, one goofy looking dude.Todd Sucherman, is that the drummer here? killer. the only bright spot on this whole concert.POSERS"
2,Styx DVD One,"This DVD is not real great sounding, given that it was recorded before the full scale digital recording revolution took place!The music sounds fair but needs to be upgraded to digital quality with re-mixing the original tapes and video!Other than that the concert it self isn't much to watch, to much power tripping for the old styx leader of the band!!!"
2,The sound is not that good.,I love Styx and I was hoping this last concert where all the original members performed together would sound great. Unfortunately it does not sound good. There is not much range and the sound itself sounds compressed.
4,Styx classics returning to Paradise Theatre,"I bought this DVD in order to replace a VHS I still have since late 90's. The sound is far better comparing to the VHS and the image, of course, is upgraded to the possible level, since it is a show recorded a long time ago. There are some interesting bonuses, including an interview with Tommy Shaw. For Styx fans and Classic Rock aficionados."
2,"Big Styx fan, disappointing audio quality and mix","I'm a big Styx fan and was hoping to find a good quality recording of their stuff in 5.1 (DTS or DD, I don't care). I am very disappointed with the 5.1 audio of this DVD, both the mix and the audio quality. I honestly thought something was wrong with my home theater until I stuck in one of my Eagles DVDs - the theater's fine; this DVD's audio is just not what I had hoped for."
4,Four Real is FOUR star FUN!!!!!!,"My family and I love this game! Even when you make a mistake, if you laugh at yourself, then you'll still have a ball. Our favorite category is ""COUCH POTATO"" and anyone who watch's TV will too. A great family game or party game(if played as teams)."
4,Fun Game...Four Real,"This was alot of fun. There were some hard questions, but alot that were able to be answered. The directions were very vague. It is a long game, depending on how much you bid from each question. Alot of the questions had the same answers. Very fun game!"
4,Ably done and of high interest,"I was not going to review this book, since I doubt my qualifications, but since there is no review posted I will tell you what I thought of the book. The author takes up very interesting topics, such as, e.g., the expansion of the president's power in foreign affairs--powered by Justice Sutherland--and the ""canonization"" of Supreme Court Justices Holmes and Brandeis and the ""demonization"" of Justices Van Devanter, Sutherland, Butler and McReynolds. Some of his discussion was hard to follow. He throws around terms like, for instance, ""essentialist."" I guess my study of philosophy and jurisprudence is too far in the past and I wish he had done a better job explaining terms such as that. I enjoyed about 75% of the book, and am now interested in any rejoinder to the book's claims that may have come out since it was published."
5,AWESOME BOOK,Couldnt stop reading this book!! It is amazingly intersting and I read it all the way through once I got started. Must read this one!!
3,"Les dio un poco de ""flojera"" a los amigos autores...","Parece que si, pues aunque el libro cubre la mayor parte de los temas relacionados a configuracion de servidores DHCP, WINS y DNS utilizando NT considero que el libro es pobre en ejemplos ilustrativos, graficos de flujo, consejos y trucos.Honestamente no recomiendo el libro si es que tienes un serio proyecto en mente para crear un nodo internet y deseas desarrollar toda la infraestructura de soporte TCP/IP.Este es un libro frio, una clase magistral distante de hace unos 50 años atras sobre un tema tan moderno como TCP/IP, que mantiene al lector muy lejos del autor.Veamoslo de esta forma matematica:Este libro + Más graficos + Trucos y Consejos = Que buen libro !!Espero sinceramente que mi revision te ayude a hacer una buena decision. Saludos.Piyux."
3,Private sessions,It did not come with the insert the dvd mentions for if you have any questions. Sound is a little messed up at times.
4,"Great singing, poor staging","Why do directors have to detract from operas by forcing the viewer to watch their ego (which they call creativity)? The singing, acting, and orchestra are very good. So is the opera (one of Massenet.s most popular). But the scenery and the shift of time to the 1950s make it seem silly. As for the scenery, the giant tree that is the theme in all four acts is fine for act 1 (the garden) and act II (the town square, but is rather silly as the wall of the sitting room in act III and is totally ridiculous in Act IV where Werther's death bed in his bedroom is under this tree. Changing the time to the 1950s makes the plot unbeleavable. Girls of the 1950s simply didn't refused the man they loved to marry the man their late mother had wanted them to marry."
4,Excellent Hodge-Podge,"This book is a compendium of wonderful information on almost every aspect of raising pastured poultry. Ideas and information on feeds, breeding, housing, processing, and even the business and insurance side of poultry farming are covered. It's well worth the money for any small-scale poultry farmer. The one downside is that, since it is a collection of articles published over several years, the information is sometimes incomplete, duplicated, or slightly disorganized. Don't expect it to be an easy reference book on any topic, but if you approach it as a wealth of great ideas from experienced farmers you won't be disappointed."
4,Raising Poultry on Pasture,"Great resource and full of information, however I wished it had more pictures to show what they are talking about."
3,"Works okay, but is gooey and doesn't last long","I ordered this because I was looking for something a little more heavy-duty than the Nexcare skin crack care. It does work okay, but the consistency can be confusing at first. It's very gooey and you think that it won't dry. But it does if you don't put it on too thick. You can't get all the product out of the bottle without some effort; I'm sure some of mine was wasted. During one of these attempts to get the rest out of the bottle, that was near the top of the lid, the applicator came off the top of the wand...so my bottle was finished, whether it was really empty or not. I used to use Liquid Bandaid, but I think that product was discontinued. It worked well and I haven't found a really good substitute for it. For now, I will stick with the skin crack care, even though it wears off faster. The bottle and wand are a different design, and I won't lose any product using it."
4,Chronicals of the Crusades,"A nice addition to a Templar Enthusiast's library. It does a great job showing how the Templar's contemporaries viewed them and their actions while on Crusade. Written by folks who were there, so don't expect your typical history lesson."
2,Wrong publication date,"I ordered the 2009 version of the paperback, but was sent the 1988 version of the same paperback. The book is intact, however because of age, all the pages are yellowed and feel ""old."" It is my guess that the book will not hold up as well due to age. Even more frustrating is that I was charged $8.98, and the back cover clearly states a suggested retail price of $6.95."
5,Chronicles of the Crusades,"These are both excellent accounts of the crusades. Villehardouin proves insightful in what he does not say. A small army of crusaders faces unbelievable odds in Constantinople and yet somehow they conquer and hold this territory. It brings up the question of whether the conquest was an accident or a conspiracy, and a reader can answer that question through careful reading. There are other books wholly committed to this argument of conspiracy vs. accident.Joinville gives an equally appreciable account of a crusade, this time a failed attempt in Egypt by Saint Louis. Joinville is an author that gives a huge amount of information. The integrity of Louis is apparent as well as the mistakes made by the crusaders (Joinville rarely places direct blame of any failure on Louis, noting instead Louis's brother and his failures.)This is a well introduced book and is not difficult to read in my opinion."
2,Poor Quality Product,"I don't know what others are looking for but I didn't find what I had hoped for in these shorts. The fabric is stiff, almost rough rather than supple. The crotch has a 2 - 2 1/2"" inset that is unsightly and the seam in the back is folded over at the waistband, and sewn down. Poor workmanship. Also, the waistband is the kind used on men's underwear, which makes the shorts look like an undergarment. Return policy is poor and shipping is high so make sure you are not going to return these shorts."
3,"Good, but tricky...","I love the double seam because I have issues with seams that ride up uncomfortably. I've purchased all colors of these and in a few different sizes. The red medium is the same as the large white (women's). The blue and black mediums are smaller than the large white/medium red. These do not have a cotton crotch and the material is very thin, like pantyhose (in fact, they run easily and have to be treated delicately and washed in detergent without any bleach whatsoever), so they leave absolutely nothing to the imagination. I don't recommend getting these too tight, especially if you're riding a bike because they are so thin that as you bend over, there's no privacy whatsoever. Again, they are very comfortable and I love them, but I wish the material were more durable. They are priced correctly, I think."
1,no compression,"I ordered a large which I usually wear and when it arrived, the fit was nothing what I expected for compression shorts so I returned it for a medium and still there's no compression. I am not happy with them."
2,Ok shorts but will pass on another pair,I use these type of shorts for biking. They are OK but will not be getting another pair. This is due to the uncomfortable waistband and they are a bit too short for my needs. A shame because price is better than other brands. It would have been nice if the inseam length was mentioned in the ad. No problems with shipment from this supplier- arrived within a few days of order.
4,"Concise, fun, and informative","For readers intrigued by alleged UFO occupant encounters and close encounters of the third kind, Patrick Huyghe's ""The Field Guide to Extraterrestrials"" is a fascinating reference that reflects the same academic sensibility on display in ""The Field Guide to UFOs."" This book is a holistic (and unnerving) rogues' gallery of ETs, categorized according to characteristics and presented in informed, concise chapters. Harry Trumbore's exacting illustrations help bring Huyghe's text to life. ""The Field Guide to Extraterrestrials"" is as much fun as UFO books get."
2,Great Computer . . . While it lasted.,"I finally bought this computer 4 months ago for college, after sampling and returning two different compaqs. Overall, I was very happy with it. I am not a gamer, but I had few problems with it. Occasionally the feature intended to run a DVD without turning on the hard drive (very handy) would freeze up, but other than that, wonderful! Good battery life, good graphics, nice screen, handy remote, pretty good speakers, nice keyboard, held up well when transported, and not too heavy. However, 4 months after purchase, it died. The monitor turned off in the middle of operation, and it would not turn back on for longer than 30 seconds. Still under factory warranty, I sent it in to Hp, but despite numerous phonecalls, no one even got back to me to give me a time estimate for its return for over two and a half weeks. Overall, I would recommend a more reliable brand of computer. (I had ZERO problems with my last laptop, a dell, in 3 years of heavy use.)"
4,Great computer,I just purchased this computer and i really like it. The screen quality is excellent and the sound system is also above average for a laptop. I love the remote control feature for watching movies and dvd's. The only problem I have encountered in the week that I've had it is that sometimes it will freeze-up when I try to start a game or even when I start up the computer. I am really happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone.
5,Used Book,I purchased this book that was no longer available in bookstores. It was in very good condition as advertised and I was very happy that the vendor made it available.
5,Teacher Effectiveness Training,A quick and easy way to buy a book. I was susprised how soon the book arrived.A Good deal!!
4,Drive,Not a bad show considering it wasn't even a whole season. It's too bad they didn't give it a chance.
4,"Almost, But Not Quite....","I purchased this from Amazon about a month ago. Due to a neuromuscular disease I am mostly wheelchair bound and was concerned about muscular deterioration in my arms and legs. This review is mostly positive because the Oxycycle has worked flawlessly for me and I use it for exercising my arms or legs most days. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is it's lack of resistence when you ""bicycle"" with it. You have to do it continuously for hours to make it into an aerobic workout. Another small aggravation - the motor automatically ""times out"" after 15 minutes requiring you to turn it off then on to restart the internal timer. So far I've found no way to alter this. But for ""range of motion"" exercises it is perfect."
2,Unrealistic?,"While a very entertaining read, I find a lack of solid ""Here is what you should do for this"" advice turns this book into more of a fact based novel than a book on how to actually ""get the most out of life with attention deficit disorder.""I also struggle with a bit of a credibility issue when it comes to these authors. They claim to both have ADD themselves yet they both somehow managed to make it all the way through medical school and become very successful yet they don't write about how they did that. I sure would love to see a book written by these two that details exactly what strategies they used to get through medical school, how difficult it actually was, what were the difficult parts and what were the easy parts, the times they thought they weren't going to make it, and then some. If they didn't struggle in some way with medical school then sorry, theres just no way these folks have ADD themselves."
5,This Book Has Changed My Life Forever!,"After struggling for my entire adult life to find answers, I came across Dr. Hallowell's book. Within the first chapter, I already felt a lifetime of weight lifted away. It's uncanny how Dr. Hallowell is able to explain the intricacies of ADHD in a manner that sounds as if he's actually describing my life from birth to age 34. This book has truly changed my life for the better, and completely changed my perspective on who I am and how I fit into the context of life.If you have ADHD, think you might have ADHD, or care about someone in one of these two categories.....READ THIS BOOK!"
2,add / adhd,"I am not a doctor so forgive me if my classifications are not exact. If you have ADHD this may be the book for you. If you have ADD or as they call it ADHD-PI, this is not the book for you. Comparing ADHD to Inattentive ADD is like comparing lung cancer to heart disease. Yes they both may cause death, but otherwise they have little else in common. It really annoys me when these so called experts group ADHD with inattentive ADD. They are very different. Russell Barkley seems to have a much greater handle on this than this guy. This review comes from someone who has inattentive ADD but has no ""H"" anywhere."
4,upbeat and positive,"Gives an upbeat and positive spin to ADHD, and hope for those struggling. a bit hard to read for those with ADHD, but a section is included with those in mind."
4,I AM DELIVERED!!!!,"I SAW THIS BOOK AND IT'S AUTHOR ON THE DR. PHIL SHOW AND I WAS AMAZED THAT THERE WERE OTHERS OUT THERE JUST LIKE ME!! I PROMPTLY JUMPED ON AMAZON.COM TO SHOP FOR THIS BOOK. I WAS AMAZED AT THE PRICES I FOUND AS WELL AS THE SPEEDINESS WITH WICH IT WAS DELIVERED. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK AND FOR ANYONE STRUGGLING WITH ADD, THIS IS A MUST READ."
2,BORING!,This is a very difficult read because it was very boring. The author's...seemed to go and on before getting to the point. They also recommend a lot of tests which I am sure is very expensive. They also want you to see a number of people to help diagnose you. They seem to be into taking a lot of supplements. Some I agree but for the most part not. The part about piles is called not add but hoarders disorder. People who have ADD should not write books. The book was very general. I got very little out of it.
2,My husband never finished it. . .,Obviously not written well enough for a distracted man to read it.
2,Better books out there,"As a fellow psychiatrist that specializes in adult ADHD I am indebted to the authors for putting ADHD on the map with their first book Driven to Distraction. I was expecting more of the same but came away very disappointed. The authors describe theories of causation and nutritional remedies that have either no evidence to support them or have been debunked a long time ago. This disorder is difficult enough to suffer with and treat to take such a reckless approach. Even worse is the writers are held (rightfully so) in such high regard by people with ADHD. I would recommendAttention Deficit Disorder: The Unfocused Mind in Children and Adults (Yale University Press Health & Wellness)by Thomas Brown, PhD. It is a much more scientifically accurate book written for ordinary people that makes understanding this disorder much easier than any other book I've found."
5,how to control ADD,"The two authors who both have ADD give much insight into treatments for ADD. They highly recommend physical exercise saying, ""Ten minutes of exercise is equal to one Prozac and one Ritalin."" Besides describing the usual types of treatments they offer various balance exercises and drawing drills to help rewire the brain. They offer a method of modifying AA's twelve steps to control ADD. They talk about other disorders like bipolar illness that often occur together with ADD. They have a whole chapter illustrating the subtle differences between the two. Basically ADD people are consistent with their moods, bipolar people cycle through periods where they might be quite functional."
3,"Good, but not as enlightening as ""Driven to Distraction""","The predecessor to this book, ""Driven to Distraction,"" was more enlightening. However, ""Delivered From Distraction"" is still an interesting and sympathetic take on ADHD and those affected by it."
5,Very good book,"I like how Hallowell treats ADD not a an affliction but as a potential gift that needs to be managed and understood. ADD and ADHD have such a negative conotation, it is nice to get a postive approach to dealing with it."
5,Delivered from Distraction was a great help to me.,"Delivered from Distraction was written by the best in the field. Their earlier book, Driven to Distraction was ground breaking and has been a foundation book for a decade.The newest book was easy to read. The author writes as if he is talking to you over coffee at Starbucks. He has ADD and a sense of humor. He has given new information based on the last ten years of working with the folks from the first book. Much more insight came from this especially for adults with ADD.I marked over a dozen insightful and useful passages.He explained the different medications, so now,I'm informed and can talk with the doctors about my choices for medication.Best of all, this book gives me strategies to be able to make the most of my creative talents."
2,frustrating stories with very little actions content,"yes, I agree with Charles and others.Having read the prior book (Driven to ...), I was hoping for more and updated guidance in this book.In this book, I finally got so tired of the author's extended 'talking about' his enthusiasm for a fellow practitioner or remedy, WITHOUT giving any advice that I sent it back.To me, I got a frustrating feeling similar to: the initially shared good feeling, but eventually grating kind of childish positive enthusiasm without much content.I guess he just wanted to get another book out and publicity, etc?The earlier book was actually better as I recall."
5,The Most Practical ADD Book,"Edward Hallowell's latest book is by far the most useful book I have found on ADD. The book is easy to read, even for someone with ADD. It was written by an ADDer for ADDers. It's even better than his original, Driven to Distraction."
3,Not the best out there...,"As late diagnosed ADD'r, I've given me a ""reading overdose"" on the subject. This book is quite ok, but there are better. I'll dare to suggest that Dr. Russell A. Barkley is the man to follow on this matter. Not always the funnier or easier author, but the knowledge has the most complete, serious and research founded knowledge about AD/HD."
5,"Intelligent, informative, encouraging and positive","Excellent book - very informative. It is written by a leading expert in the field, a doctor who successfully treated houndreds of people. The book is very helpful, it is written with deep understanding of ADHD, and how it influences one's life. I really appreciate positive and encouraging tone of the book - it gives you optimism and positive energy to deal with ADHD. The book explains ADHD with numerous real life examples, and teaches how to make ADHD improve your life, not disable it."
2,Can We Lookit the Pretty Horsies Some More?,"The photographs are gorgeous, the models used can be recognised galloping about Vavra's true classics of equine behavior ""Equus"" and ""Such Is Te Real Nature of Horses"", and they only make up less than half of this lead sinker of a book. The rest of the book has some wonderful line drawings, a fictional quest for a unicorn and a rehashing of all known unicorn lore since times before Christ... unfortunately, just not that well-written. The photos are the stars of any Vavra phto book, and this one would have fared so much better if it had more photos and less textbook. Not worth the money."
5,"Beautiful, Magical!","This is one of the best books on Unicorns I have ever read. It is unique because it is the only book on the unicorn with photos. Vavra gives you a new sense of wonder on every page. Taking you to the desert, the tundra, the forest, the flowers and even the sea. After that you can read up on unicorn behavior, history, and some of Vavra's own experiences with them. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves unicorns, and would like to learn more of them. Or if you love beautiful, breathtaking photography."
5,Fabulous Realistic and exquisite unicorns-you will believe!,This is one of the most fabulous coffee table books ever published. Robert Vavra does his utmost to convey the reality of unicorns. No disclaimers are evident. A perfect photography job...a perfect book!
5,Unicorns,"My one nagging question while looking this over was.. are these real? Yes, I believe in unicorns, but not as purely physical beings.. ie, not the kind of creature you can snap photographs of!Despite all that this was a wonderful book. The photos are beautiful and the poetry is a nice touch, and the information in the back of the book is very interesting and includes some history of unicorns as well.If you love these so-called 'mythical' beings, by all means get this book :)"
5,Great for Big or Small,"I received this book as a gift from my father when I was 8 years old. The book, the binding, and the pictures were so precious to me at that age--I cherished and protected it for many, many years. If you think your child can keep this in good condition and is interested in unicorns, I promise you...the book will never lose its magic. I kept it through my teenage years and then somehow lost it. Now, at age 30, I am purchasing it again so that I can look at these wonderful images once more. I suggest you do an image search on Robert Vavra's photography and you will see how this book will NOT disappoint. An EXCELLENT coffee table book, or like I said...a beloved childrens gift indeed"
1,not as expected,I was very disappointed ----- I don't know how these are considered 12 ply ----- very thin ------ not what I wanted. Won't make that mistake again.
1,Not a good quality gauze pad.,I didn't realize the poor quality of the pad. Very thin not very absorbant.
2,Sterile Gauze Pads from Dukal Corp,These pads are thin and far from being as thick and absorbent as Johnson & Johnson or even the Rite Aid brand. The packaging far out did the pad itself. If the company put as much inot the product instead of the packing may have been a difference.
5,Good buy,We had our first baby recently and in the hospital they used the gauze pads instead of wipes. We really liked it and thought of using it we got back. I searched for this at several stores and but could not find it. After searching on internet found it at Amazon. The order was delivered so quick that I was surprised with it. A very good buy.
1,Much better apologetics exist...,"While I'm not Christian, I can certainly tell when pro-Christian arguments are executed poorly. This book is full of them. I have met average man-on-the-street Christians that do a better job of supporting the unsupportable than Dr. Kennedy does.His arguments consist primarily of unsubstantiated assertions, the use of analogy as fact, wishful thinking, arguments from authority, and the god of the gaps. One look at his science know-how in which he claims that solid materials (i.e. stones) are able to record all the conversations held in their presence should give you a clue as to the intellect at work here.The only purpose this book should serve in a Christian educational setting is to help boost the shorter kids up in their seats."
1,http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/alex_matulich/,"_Why I Believe_ is a concise, easy-to-read book containing most of the typical Christian arguments about the subjects below, in one convenient place - making it an excellent instrument for use as a jumping-off point for critical and honest commentaries on these subjects. Please see http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/alex_matulich/why_i_believe/ for a comprehensive rebuttal to this book"
4,An excellent defense of biblical Chrisitianity.,Dr. Kennedy presents a fine defense of the essentials of the Christian faith against the rising tide of theological liberalism. It enables Christian laypeople to confidently defend their beliefs against secular humanism that has negatively impacted our world.
5,Why I Believe,"This book helped put into words why Christians believe in the Bible and bibical doctrine. I found it very helpful and informative and I will share it with friends. It also asked the question, ""Are you a believer, have you made the commitment to Jesus Christ?"". Sharing the book is also an excellent way of sharing Christ and having people search their hearts to know the answer to the questions. I would recommend this book to believers who want to be able to better share Christ."
5,love this book,"great author, great book,love it! would love it if he went more in depth with things, but still a great book"
2,Not What I Expected!,"While presented as a The Diving Guide for Cozumel, Cancun, and the Mayan Riviera it falls far short of being such. Oh, yes it does cover dive sites for each area, but not nearly as many sites as other dive books on these locations. The book is full of beautiful photographs, and some good travel tips. The section on diving Cenotes is informative and covers 10 of the most popular sites. My biggest complaint is the print and design format of the book. On most pages light colored print copy is printed on top of soft pastel colored boxes and half moon designs. This makes the print differcult to see and I found myself straining to read it. The waterproof fish and invertebrates indentification card that comes with the book is useless. The pictures on the card are not sharp and hard to see. In some cases I can't even makeout what the animals and fish are suposed to be. I would not recommend this book for the serious diver."
1,Not what i Expected,"There werent any maps of the reefs, it didint go into detail about anyhting.It was a very short, and very dissapointing. i sent it back"
1,UGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS NOT COOL.ESWEETIE YOU ARE WRONG. THIS IS UGLY AND DUMB.SO GO AWAY IF YOU DON'T PLEASE.Love Blossom47
5,Bratz are much better than my scene right now,"I love these twiins very much and I am going to get them soon.There are also new Twiins named Krysta and Lela.I loved them too.And yes:My scene dolls are getting nasty and they are getting belly button jewels in each collection,ecxept Year os Style.I am beginig to hate my scene right now.Bratz are much better,and more fun to play with,and no belly button jewels,except Rock Angelz.I prefer to get Bratz right now,and I am thinking of to never get a single my scene doll anymore.They are getting bad.And they look like Bratz.I think it`s better to get a Bratz doll.SARA SIBLINI!!!"
5,SOOO ON MY LIST!!!,"If you think these dolls r stupid, well UR WRONG!!! because these are soooo cute and i think that they are a bit prettier than tess and nona, but thats just my opinon. I also like roxxi and phoebe too, cause they're cool. plus THEY ARE SOO ON MY XMAS LIST!!!! i cant wait till i get them!p.s. i think they look nothing like cloe!!!"
5,Triiplets- and Twiins!,"These dolls are not only Twiins- they are triiplets too! The Triiplets set has come out now, or if you have decided to get this set, buy their missing sister Siereena from the sweet dreamz collcetion!Valentina is the sweetest. She is a angel with a cute keychain and is a fashion designer. She comes with a fashion portiofolio, with 2 designs! She has her hair pulled back from her sweeping fringe, then let out freely and smooth! She likes light, vibrant colours but Orrianna tells her that dark colours suit Valentina best and light colours suit her best.Orrianna comes with a spunky devil keychain and is the coolest. She is not mean, as most people reviewing this item look up to her like that! She is very kind and surpports her sister, who is a little shy. She has long, blonde and flowing hair, a little streaked just like her sisters! She comes with a plastic guitar like the Rock Angelz one.These dolls are superlicious! On my wishlist and a total mustbuy!"
3,Colorful,"This book has a poem on the left side and a divided picture on the right side. The poem matches that monster (picture) only. You can mix and match the pictures but the poems don't make sense if you do. That's why I only gave it 3 stars. Kids will enjoy it despite that fact. It's very colorful, cute and the poems rhyme."
3,Dizzying........,"While Sarah's performance is very good and her band sounds great with a good mix, the editing of this concert almost makes it unwatchable. There are a lot, and I mean a lot, of quick tight shots of Sarah and band members done in a what seems like an edit a second - a real distraction from the music. Note to directors and editors: These are concerts - we the viewers have longer attention spans than your typical 3 minute music video requires. The only thing that saves the video portion of this DVD are the alternate angles provided on 4 songs - allowing the viewer to control what he/she sees. I found this very beneficial. Chose the ""wide angle"" option and left it there - MUCH BETTER! Felt like I was at an actual concert... too bad the multi-angle wasn't available for the whole show."
3,"Good music, good performance, mediocre vidio editing and sound","Mirrorball (CD) is a favorite CD of mine, so I was eager to watch the concert DVD. I haven't seen many concert DVDs, but I was thrilled by Fleetwood Mac's The Dance DVD, so I thought I might be by this too.Unfortunately, the audio mix was inferior to the CD's audio (and the overall level was very low) and the camera shots changed so rapidly that it was difficult to view it as more than a glorified music video. On MTV it's appropriate to change shots with every measure, but it's too distracting on a live-concert DVD.If you're a fan of Sarah McLachlan, I'd still recommend buying this. But, if you want a concert DVD to put on and listen to as a great-sounding concert, it might not be worth it to you -- check out The Dance instead:Fleetwood Mac - The DanceMirrorball"
3,It's good....but it could have been better.,"Sarah's new DVD is good, but it could have been so much better. I was glad to see that others who have reviewed Mirrorball picked up on the same issues that I have with this new release. I thought something was wrong with the set up on my DVD/Home Theater system....the sound was muddy and not properly defined as it should be for 5.1 playback. After many attempts to adjust the system set-up I realized the DVD is just poorly recorded. Way to much ambience and not enough clarity I think. Sarah's vocals should come straight out of the center channel, but instead the vocals radiate from everywhere but the center channel. I also think that the film footage is matched to other recorded performances from the tour. As a musician, I can tell when things are not in sync...and it happens a lot on this DVD. So...still a good buy and worth owning, but with an artist like Sarah it is a shame it is not better."
3,Very Entertaining but didn't feel like I was really there.,"I agree with the previous comments ""the dvd is worth owning just for the extra music...and it is entertaining, but entertaining like a tv show, not a live concert"". My basis for comparing all other DVDs is James Taylor's ""Live at the Beacon"". This DVD needs to be re-mixed to compare.Yes, I tried this DVD in Stereo and Dolby 5.1. The Dolby 5.1 mix has some terrible ""fake"" delays in the rear channel. You know, I've never been to a concert where the stage sound came from the rear. The stereo mode is extremely compressed.I was so disappointed with this DVD, I wrote Arista and pleaded for a re-mix and re-release. I'd love to hear this after a professional audio engineer gets his/her hands on it."
5,Really great DVD,"This DVD shows Sarah McLachlan at her best. It's a concert that focuses on her music instead of being a huge stage show, and I really like that. It also has some cool special features."
2,Mirrorball,"After buying the Mirrorball CD and being totally impressed, and as Sarah has not done a concert tour of Australia, I was really looking forward to this DVD. Sadly I was bitterly dissapointed. The audio leaves a lot to be desired, and is obviously *not* the same live tracks as presented on the CD. The audio is noticeably out of sync to the video in every song, in fact some of the tracks don't even sound live, its like they took the studio CD sound and added it to the video.Dissapointed."
2,The sound system is teribble,"I have a very nice set of Home theater / Hi Fi , The sound of this album that came out is too bad, If I could I definately return it, of couse I love Sarah."
3,mixed bag,"I enjoyed the lighting, editing and the general visual presentation. Enjoyed the performance by the band, although it would have been interesting to hear them shake things up a bit more instead of trying for such a rote repeat of the studio tone. Some songs ventured out a bit, but generally stuck close to the original.What was really disappointing was the sound. I ended up listening in stereo, since the 5.1 mix was so poor. Sounded like they put one mic in the middle of the hall,then stuck even more reverb in the surround channels. Truly bad."
4,Beauty Abound,"Sarah McLachlan's Mirrorball DVD is a must have for any of her fans with a DVD player. It captures the beauty and passion of her live show as well as the dynamics of the band and how well they work together. The clarity of the DVD makes you feel like you are there. The DVD also has decent extras, the interview is a nice addition, the bonus angles and photos are a fun novelty but I really wouldn't miss them if the weren't included. I have experienced the audio problems that other people have mentioned, I tried to adjust the speakers but nothing seemed to help much. I was going to give 5 stars but I think it should get a 4 and a half due to the audio problems. Worth the money."
3,DEFECT ON THE MULTI ANGLE WAS AN UPSET,I BOUGHT THE DISC ESPECIALLY FOR THE MULTI ANGLE EFFECT. THE DVD WOULD LOCK UP WHEN PLAYING THE SECTION. WHAT AN UPSET! CONCERT WAS NICE & SWEET CONSIDERING HOW LOW KEY SARAH IS.
2,"Great performance, lousy sound and video","The concert was captured on film...too bad, it is poorly done. Sound is just as bad. In fact the concert sounds better in Pro-logic then it does in AC-3. As far as her performance goes...it is first rate as usual. It is too bad that it was spoiled by crummy sound and video production."
3,Music Videos *not* concert footage.,"I love Sarah's music, but I am disappointed with this video. I went to a concert on her Surfacing tour, so it is painful to watch these canned music videos. It is a very poor representation of her Surfacing tour.I would have much rather have had a few static shots from the angle of the audience instead of the constant switching between closeups. The viewer gets no feeling of how great it was to be at a Sarah concert.I am glad I copied VH-1 Storytellers, it is more realistic and I will watch it many more times, unlike these music videos.+5 for the music -2 for the video."
5,Mirrorball Reflects Again The undenying Talents,"It is been almost a year since the release of the CD version of Mirrorball, and I am still amazed by the CD even now. No surprise that how eager any fans will be thrilled with the DVD version of the event. Thanks to the DVD technology, I guess fans are glad to get the full version of the event (inculding tracks like ""Plenty"", ""Vox"" and ""Wait"", that was not released on the CD version). In addition, it includes an interview segment with Sarah herself. The word is out... Sarah is gorgeous - both her talents and charisma. And the only way to witness is to see it yourself. With the great sense of stage managment and superb lighting arrangement... Sarah's powerful and emotional performance makes ""Mirrorball"" a touching and grand visual experience in times to come."
3,neidlewit,"... Sound Quality is okay, lows are hard to find, video is not bad ""seen much worse"". Sarah's make UP is rather glam in this, she sings a decent repertoire, but she seems a little stiff ""Dean Martin style"" ... her body language fails to help you (audience) gain an emotional presence. I envisioned her to be VERY sensual in concert ""but NO!""You get Sarah singing her songs; but, not much more unfortunately... as much as I enjoy her songs, this performance would not prompt me to see her on stage ""What a shame"""
2,Too flashy,"Not only is this DVD concert far too flashy for me, Sarah also performs far too many songs from Fumbling Towards Ecstasy (do we really need to hear Mary or Ice?) and not enough from the wonderful Solace. If you want to see a less flashy video concert even though Sarah still performs too-few Solace songs, buy Fumbling Towards Ecstasy, Live."
1,Mirrorball - waste of money,Do not buy this DVD. Spend your money on her CDs. The DVD is extremely poorly produced.
2,Horrible sync. problem,Good songs but the audio/video sync. problem makes it hard for me to enjoy them. I regret buying this DVD.
2,Doesn't Do Everything It Claims,"The Innova 3340 mulitmeter looks and feels like a quality instrument. Most of the functions work great but I bought it primarily for the tachometer and dwell angle features. I tried those on two cars and got erratic and erroneous meetings with each. I sent the item back to Innova and they claimed they couldn't find a problem, sending it back to me after a few weeks. Again I tried the tach and dwell on a '69 VW. The tach read over 4,000 rpm with the engine at idle and the dwell was a fixed 90 degrees. This product did not satisfy me and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone needing those functions."
5,Great DMM for the price.,"I've worked with, played with, designed, built, repaired and cussed at electrical and electronic devices for over half a century and have used some very good test equipment along the way, but test equipment has came a long way since I picked up my first analog meter back in the '50s and this little jewel does what the best meters money could buy just a few years ago could do, and costs only a fraction of what they did, and many still do.The meter is designed with the needs of an automobile mechanic in mind, but I use it for an electric Golf Cart and it works very well for that purpose as well as numerous other things around the house.Very satisfied with it and will recommend to family and friends."
2,Poorly written manual.,"I was intrigued by the many features this unit had and while it seemed a bit pricey for a DMM I thought I'd give it a try. it didn't take me long to regret spending $70 for it though. The instruction manual does not even provide a basic understanding of the unit and its features. the probe holders don't hold the probes, the induction pickup doesn't read, and the temperature probe has a 10 degree error. Went to the Equus website for help and found it not working with broken links and dead ends. Sent it back to Amazon for a full refund."
1,Equus 3340,"Feels cheaply made, the battery contacts were rusted as soon i received the unit. I opened the meter to look inside and and plastic parts were melted maybe from the soldering pen making contact"
5,Great,Came in quick and well packaged. Also great price. Thanks so much for your excellent service and product. Arrived in time for Christms.
4,"Didn't buy yet, Info for other buyers",Glad to know that this is indeed a Dual Kit which it SHOULD be. Thank you for the feedback in the first review! :)
3,"Not widescreen,not as advertised!","Claimed to be in both full and wide screen. But, not so. Either side is full screen!"
4,low budget but good.,"this movie looked like one of the cheapest movies ever made, but it was very worth watching."
1,Execrable film print.,"This disc appears to have been mastered from an ancient, worn-out 16 mm. made-for-tv print. Scratch marks, film damage, bad sound, and inept panning-and-scanning pervade the film from beginning to end. The end credits display thestatement ""Edited for TV by Paragon, Inc"". Needless to say, since this is a TV version -- a fact not disclosed by Amazon -- we don't get to see much of Ms. Baker's ample anatomical charms, which is what attracted us to her 1960's and '70's Italian films in the first place.In its online description of its manufactured-on-demand DVD service, Amazon tells us that these releases are ""manufactured from original source materials."" In my view, a hacked-up print edited for 1970's television should not qualify as ""original source materials."" Apparently, Amazon disagrees with me."
3,Good Giallo,"I'm a big Carroll Baker fan. This movie is good trash. Carroll looks beautiful in it and shows lots of skin.It's pan and scan so you miss some of the image on each side of the screen. The story is pretty suspenseful but it goes on too long. I love the trashy movies she made in Europe in the 60s and 70s. Good fun.But buy this on DVD, if you can find it."
3,"Starts out well, but second part is pure cult genre","Baker is true to form as another tortured-victim-heroine, Catherine West, widow of a wealthy race car driver vacationing in an Italian Villa while her lawyer settles the affairs of his estate. Enters a handsome young man with car trouble and his stepsister, both driven to seduce her. Yet, more is in their plans than sex. First blackmail, then captive holding, then planting a frog in her plate for dinner, all to drive her suicidal. But, wait! Her lawyer helped plan it all along to cheat her out of the inheritance and he delivers the final murder blow. Those were the days of the drive-in triple features, and it played at the Sunset last after ""Slasher Saw II."" (or movies like it.) VHS contains more erotic scenes than the Italian language DVD. Just to confuse things more about all the non-English versions of this film, the Italian film also contains some nudity that was cut from VHS, but has shorter scenes."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Execution","While the drawings and images are informative, and serve as a good cross reference with other sources for markings and camouflage, the organization of the book is maddening. Rather than choosing a simple chronological, divisional or campaign explanation of camouflage schemes, the author uses labyrinth of all of these. Chapters repeat, and yet still seem incomplete. I recommend this book only as a secondary reference."
