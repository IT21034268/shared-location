2,It shrunk,"Before we purchased this pillow cover, we had to use two separate standard-sized pillow cases on our long pillow -- one on each end. That was the only way we could cover the entire pillow. We were very happy with this purchase when it arrived because it fit our long pillow nicely, so we didn't have to use two cases anymore. However, the first time we washed and dried this new case, it shrunk by about six inches in length. Now our pillow hangs out noticeably. Everything else about the pillow case is nice. It's very soft and seems well made, for example. But for us the length won't work, and that's the only reason we purchased this, so we're disappointed."
1,"Thin, cheap cotton","This product was $23, not cheap, not expensive for a pillow case. I expected it to be better quality. Honestly, feels and looks like it was made in a sweat shop and smells funny. I am keeping it b/c we need it now, but washing it in cold water and finding a better quality one right away. Disappointed."
2,Thumbs down. Not worth $8.99,"I bought this as a backup for the microsuede pillowcase I bought at Linens & Things. I wish I had purchased a duplicate of the one I have. This fabric is rough, and I find the white, unhidden zipper to be very distracting and unappealing. Overall, I think it looks and feels very cheap. Another $6 (plus gas or shipping) to get the same microsuede pillowcase I currently have would be well worth it."
1,Don't buy unless you like sandpaper on your face,Mine just arrived and the fabric used is actually abrasive to skin.I'm going to wash it a few times with lots of fabric softener and if that doesn't help it goes in the trash.
5,thank,I needed the protection. I was all for it. It really makes me drool allot. Its so comfortable to me.
4,Great All Cotton Cover,The cover is great if you are looking for a cotton body pillow cover as most others are polyester. The only reason that I gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 is that the navy cover has a white zipper. It does not stand out too much and if it was navy then this pillow case would be perfect.
4,"Overall good product, although a bit rough","This cover arrived so quickly!! It was just in time to wrap up for Christmas, and I'm so happy with the fast response and shipping.The cover itself is very sturdy, true to size, the zipper works great. I also purchased the Beyond Down Gel Fiber Body Pillow, and had about 3 inches of fabric length leftover after I put the cover on the pillow (without being washed). My only complaint is that it feels a bit more rough than I thought it would be. Overall a great product for the price!"
2,Poor quality,"Great fit, but poor quality. After two washes, there are holes along the seam. Don't recommend it."
2,Not a pillow cover - it's a pillow protector,"Although the item description states ""body pillow cover"" - the actual product received says ""pillow protector"" - well to me a pillow protector goes underneath a pillow cover, and also the label is on the outside, not on the inside - which means it really should have a pillow cover (pillowcase) over it. Also, although the shipping was ""on time"" based on free standard shipping, I felt one month from order date to delivery is a little excessive. Probably the slowest item I have ever bought from Amazon."
3,Does the Job,"A lower thread-count helps this dry faster after washing. I've learned to avoid high-thread counts that take forever to dry. The zipper keeps everything neat, but it broke after one month. Despite this, a good product that simply gits her done."
3,larger than my pillow,"It was larger than my pillow, which a bit annoying. Also has a large zipper on the outside which is somewhat irritating."
4,Great case!,Great pillow case. Good quality and great price. I highly recommend this product. A++++ another great Amazon experience. Goes nice with the body pillow I bought the order before.
2,Zipper Broke,Zipper broke within a year of owning pillow case. Maybe this wouldn't have happened had we zipped it before washing it.
2,Cheap material but does the job,"The pillowcase is made with rough, very thin material. The fabric hardly stretches over the pillow - it is a very tight fit. However, it does the job."
2,A Real Bore,"I pity those in strategic planning if this textbook is the best around. I found it to be the most boring text I had ever read. It was hard to get more than two pages read before snoozing. I finally gave up and started reading the summaries, and then going back over the details if I had time. In addition to the boredom, the political correctness had me groaning all the way through. Exploration of Venus? - give me a break!In spite of my disgust with the textbook, the workbook was actually useful. It was to-the-point and much more understandable."
1,Missing Sections,"My wife bought this book for Strategic Planning course. Working through her assignments it was discovered that two sections of about 50 pages each are missing, Chapt 8 and most of 9. Checked rest of book and found that in addition to missing pages a duplicate section was inserted that would give the reader no indication of a problem until they actually began reading chapter 8 and then discover the missing section.Interesting book but have to rate this a one since the return date coincidentally was the same as when the missing chapter was assigned.Lesson Learned: Next time do a page check on the book to insure all the pages are there."
3,Boring read.,This was purchased as required reading for a class. The book was not well written & I ended up dumping the class.
2,dry reading material,"This book, although required for the course I was enrolled in, was overall a waste of money. The reading material was very dry, making it a pain to follow. I learned more by showing up for class, taking good notes and involving myself in the group discussions, than what I learned from attempting to ingest the contents of this book."
5,Strategic Planning for Public and Nonprofit Organizations: A Guide to Strengthening and Sustaining Organizational Achievement,The book came in a timely manner and arrived in a better condition that it was listed for. Thank you guys....awesome!!!
3,"Good, but not great",I borrowed this CD from my friend because I'm going to see them live this Saturday with Nonpoint which is an increadible band and Drowning Pool. I'll be honest and say that I've only listened to this CD once. It seems to me that the singer is the strongpoint of this band. There just is no real intensity at all with the guitars and drums. Also when the singer screams it like for one second and then that's it. Not your energizing moshpit kinda band.
4,A gift from Taproot,"I had seen Taproot on a late 120 minutes one night and immediatly fell for them. They are a very talented group of men who have been through ""Emotional Times"" and have felt ""Dragged Down"", but have obviously made a ""Comeback"". Truely, their lyrics, vocals, and music have made a huge ""Impact"" on me, and have let me ""Smile"" ""Agian & Agian"". If you like artists such as Deftones, Staind, or Glass Jaw, then i think you will enjoy this."
4,pretty good cd for a new band,these guys put fred durst in his place im glad i would not like to see aband like this under his control emotional times and mirrors reflection are cool songs if you like deftones buy this cd kick freds ass
2,"Hmmmm, not very good really","Why do people seem to love this CD so much? My friend was raving about it, and so I borrowed it, and I cant really say I was impressed. I mean it's mediocre, but the tracks all seem to sound the same, with the 'tunes' all very basic and consisting of 1 or 2 notes with heavy distortion making it all to fuzzy. Don't get me wrong, I like heavy stuff, but I'm just not too keen on this. Don't be tricked into buying this just because everyone else says it's great. Borrow it first."
4,badass,"Sounds a bit like limp bizkit, but much better in my opionion. There songs are for real, and aren't about ""nookie"" or breaking stuff. It's really pretty original sounding. Every song is good. I'll definately buy a second album, when and if they make one, and i'll buy their ep if i can ever find it."
3,ordinary....at first...,"I admit, everything sounded the same when I first heard this cd. I couldn't even tell which songs ended and began. I hated it the first few times. Then, something clicked, and I could tell every song from eachother, and I love this cd. Buy it only if you have patience for it."
5,TAPROOT RULES,"People if you don't have this CD you should get it NOW, like the best song in that album "" NOW "". Then should look forward to get their other albums, because they are all GOOD !. IS ALL GOOD !. I saw them in concert with Linkin Park and those Kids Did a great show and now I am a big fan of them."
2,Taproot: Gift,"This is such a weak band. That was my first impression of Taproot. Sure they rocked a bit but it seemed all their songs started with a big riff and just began to decompose. As I heard it more, I grew to like it. The vocals and music tend to grow on you. Overall the vocals were poor and the guitar was mediocre. Don't even ask about the lyrics."
3,Neo-industrial rap-rock,"The result of this CD is an edifice that's imposing, immense, polished, blunt...but not a place you'd like to live. Hey guys, this is your major label debut, you already have a huge following. So, you can afford to lighten up."
5,the best band out there,I've seen Taproot 4 times now and will go see them the next chance I get. Gift is an album that I think everyone can relate to in one way or another. I've met the guys twice now and every time have gone out of there way to hangout with fans. Not only do they make great cd's there also the best live band out there.
3,Not bad.,"First, I would like to say that I am a big fan of metal / hard rock, but I really don't get all of the good reviews for this CD. Its not bad, but not great. The best songs are ""Again & Again"", ""Smile"", and ""Now"", but they are, at best, mediocre. I agree that this band should be classified as heavy metal, but, relatively speaking, this album is really not that heavy. ."
4,great album,"this album definitely rises above practically everything out there at this time... yes, at times their sound does in fact have a korn-ish feel, but they are in no way playing off of korn's success. they have their own distinct feel.taproot can only go up from here, ""gift"" in no way feels like it is a fluke.highly recommended."
2,Below Average Music,"I must say I really disliked taproot from the first time i heard them. I was told to listen to them by someone saying ""They're a good limp bizkit"". I couldn't really fathom that, but Hed P.E. turned out to be just that so why not give it a shot? Well i gave it a listen and I now know exactly why people compared it to Limp Bizkit. The vocalist is really a very untalented singer. He never leaves that whiny vocal range that I have grown to hate from hearing Limp Bizkit and Mindless Self Indulgence. I don't know what i can say about this band that is really that good. The music is played with some level of talent and i must give them that. Other than that if you want a good rapcorish band i would stick with (Hed) P.E. or just go old school and listen to some self titled RATM. :)"
5,"Taproot's album ""gift"" is definately a Gift","To anyone who likes heavy in your face spastic rock n' roll, check out taproot. These guys are totally original and totally crazy. I mean you dont even need a live show to get into these guys, there music is sooo busy, your tired after listening to it. Makes me want to get up and tear stuff up. With songs like "" Smile"" and "" Mentobe"" this is definately a gift of rockin' good music, GO OUT AND GET YOUR COPY TODAY!"
5,If I could i would give this a higher rating,"To me this might be the greatest album ever.Not because they are my favorite band (the tattoo on my arm will prove it though) but for me their lyrics hit home. Their music is not the greatest but good enough to keep you going. The lyrics are what keep me coming back to their 2 albums with my ears craving more. To give you an idea of some things in here like the song ""I"" for example he says ""I hate myself sometimes,I love myself,I need this way of life because it holds me"" This is going to appeal to everyone but to some people that are having hard times and need help or guidance this really does the trick. The groups message is the same positive and uplifting giving you reason to go on when there really seems like none. I thank god if there is one that i stumbled on to this group because they have helped me in ways you could never believe."
1,What is all the buzz about!??,"I read thru all the customers reviews and they made it sound like this was band had a sound reminiscent of Korn's debut cd. WRONG!!!! Just another MTV friendly Korn sound and new Deftones cd vibe. In fact, it resembles the latter more than anything. I saw that the cd was produced by Ulrich Wild(Pantera, Static-X) so I thought it was going to be heavy. Very dissappointing. This cd is definitely going to the used cd store. Not even burnworthy!! You want some hardcore stuff, check out Black Label Society(Zakk Wylde). BLS blows any of these mainstream stuff away."
4,New Metal is dead-long live Taproot,"I came across a 5 second blast of Poem (from Welcome) on Kerang TV and decided to check out whatever of Taproot's stuff I found first. I had become bored of Linkin Park's same old story and was worried that it would be the case again here. It wasn't. Taproot seem to meld LP with ELP, and a healthy dose of Slipknot to boot. To hear so many styles together is a breath of fresh air. I would say I'm a prog fan, but the complex compositions on Gift had me drooling. Again and Again is a cracker, and Cumback is very thought provoking. The main difference between Taproot and Linkin Park? The vocals have more to them for a start, not just maudling ""you push me araound all the time"" crap, but real meaningful and even hopefull stuff. There's even a song about LOVE on there! All in all, very unexpected, but extremely good!"
2,I don't see what's so great about Taproot.,"I bought this album only because of how much everyone talks about how good this band is. Wow were they wrong. When I first listened to this CD after I bought it, the first thing I thought was that I had heard this before. This CD sounds, sadly like a half-and-half mix of KoRn and Limp Bizkit. Just think old Limp Bizkit guitars with less punch, with Jon Davis' whiny, nasal vocals and horrible lyrics, with a rhythmic verse. It's really not that hard. This is just another rap-metal album in a long line of mediocrity."
4,"Well-done, BUZZWORTHY debut!","Well, Taproot's debut sure is a ""gift"". Jam packed with heavy guitars and vocals; a good solid hardcore album. One sweet thing about this album are the use of odd time signatures throughout the songs. Gives the cd a lot of originality. This band shows MUCH talent for its debut. The lead singer caries good harmonies as well. Think as though Chino and Maynard James Keenan got drunk together. As for the rest of the band, the guitar, bass, and drums will leave your ears ringing for quite sometime. Some of the noteworthy songs on this album include ""Smile"", ""Again and Again"" (a truly remarkable song for lead singer Stephen Richards.), and ""Mirror's Reflection"". You will not be sorry to pick up this album. Great blend of metal/alternative for the millenium; and be sure to watch for these guys on the second stage at this year's Ozzfest. Enjoy!"
4,This is a great cd,This is a great cd and certinly better then the music big bands like korn and limpb izkit are putting out. By this cd or be dissapointed that you didn't
2,Cheap imitation of Bizkit.,"Another Limp Bizkit rip-off,another singer who joins the I want to be Fred club.This band is generic crap,and the only people who will enjoy this are bitter ex-bizkit fans who are mad because the band is doing great and are jealous of Fred's imense success in the media."
2,Sellouts,"Ok Taproot is a Ann Anbor, MI and l ive in Ypsilanti,Mi so i know almost everone in the band Before they made this album they played at local place around ann anbor and ypsilanti. there music was very hardcore they were in fact part of Ypsilanti Hardcore with band like Friction,brick, Nobody heros ect but until Fred Durst from limp bizkit came around. he want to sing taproot up but only if they changed there music. so what why i gave this 2 stars"
2,koRny,"I don't know what people see in this band. They sound a lot like a lot of other, much better bands, like Tool, KoRn, and the Deftones. However, they don't even come close to being as good as any of these bands. The songs are dumb, with terrible lyrics and cheesy, boring guitars. The singer tries very hard to sound like Tool's Maynard James Keenan, but he just comes off sounding whiny and annoying. Anybody who likes these guys must just not listen to Tool or Deftones, because they simply fade in comparison.After first listening to this album, I let it sit in my cd rack for a little, while, hoping it would eventually grow on me. It didn't. I eventually became so ashamed to have it next to all of my other great cd's that I took it outside and smashed it with a hammer. I just can't stand these guys. The only reason I didn't give them 1 star is because I recognize they're a new band. However, if they keep going in the direction that this album is going, they're only going to get worse."
2,Just... Disappointing.,"Disappointing. Very disappointing. Their first album is excellent. Their newest album is excellent, but this one is simply disappointing.Not one of the songs hit me as ""good"" and that's just... well, disappointing."
5,taproot comes through .. as i expected,this cd is awsome . it rules. its hardcore/emo at its best. they really sounds like a mixture of staind and glassJAw. if u like either of those bands youll love taproot. the singer has one of those melodic voices that u love and then a scream to wake u out of that melodic trance. BUY TAPROOT NOW ! BEFORE THEY BLOW UP (NO DOUBT THEY WILL) BE AN ORIGNAL FAN ! and remmeber . tapRoot rules all
3,sketchy,"Taproot displays a lot of talent no doubt, but after a while the lead singers voice got a little anoying to me. now its just become an expensive cup coaster for me."
2,Run of the mill...,"I saw these guys in concert...and I quite liked them, even though the songs did sound a little samey, so when I came home I downloaded ""Again & Again"" and ""I"", I loved both of these songs, so I got the album...how disappointed I was, the rest of the songs just seem to merge into one big mess of metal by numbers, sure there's some nice wee industrial noise bits, but it really is as bad as the rest of the nu-metal stuff out there, with the notable exception of ""I"" which i (no pun intended) really like...if you want to have your mind numbed then buy this and all the other Nu-Metal rubbish, else stick to NIN, Metallica, Tool and the other great bands out there."
4,"Finally, something good from Michigan...","Very, very good album. On first listen, I liked it, but didn't think it was anything special. But after listen number 2, 3, and 4, I realized it was much better than I originally thought. In my opinion, Taproot has a sound in common with some other excellent bands, such as deftones (vocals similar to Chino), KoRn (similar musically, though not identical), and staind (same as KoRn). If you like any of these bands, I would definitly check out Taproot; you won't be disappointed."
4,A comprehensive Instructor's book for reference,"If anyone is still pursuing AutoCad R. 14, this reference book is a ""Must"" have item."
2,DO NOT Purchase if You Don't Have To...,"Highly unfortunate that my instructor made this a required text. I do admit that it has interesting information, but for a condensed LPN program, where there is no time for searching all over the world, I say that this is a waste of time when you want quick information. Nice for the library (after graduation), but not worth the headache. Spend your money where you can get the help."
4,i would watch James Nesbitt in a Twilight film,"I love this guy, he made a fan of me with ""Jekyll"", a wonderful retelling, and solidified his status with ""Five Minutes of Heaven"". He does great work in this piece, it may have been a bit too grim, ITV hasn't renewed it for a second season. Too bad, back to the search engines, but I did watch the six episodes back to back, so I recommend it heartily."
4,interesting work,"We're both avid fans of James Nesbitt but this series just didn't do it for us. Murphy's Law, is our all time favorite of his works that we've seen."
1,false information,"These patches are definitely just a piece of band aide plastic, I had them analyzed at my husband's lab, none of the ""active"" ingredients are present, do not purchase them, they are a total waste of money. I have purchased patches that are shipped from Europe, they work extremely well, and have the natural ingredients that actually help promote a decrease in appetite!!!"
1,Doesn't work,What else needs to be said? It didn't even stick well enough to be a bandage! I don't know why I wasted my money.
1,Does not work,"These patches does not work, they are the worstOriginal Diet Patch 30 Patches By Dermatholclaim to weight loss ever. I do not recommend them at all"
3,"Hard to remember, not much results.","Hard for me to remember to put them on, and I don't have any results yet because it is my first month. I don't feel as hungry when I am wearing it, which is nice."
2,Doesn't Work,This product does not work. And the information on the packages are mostly false. They only say what people want to hear to make them purchase it. Some companies have even been find because of this issue. And some side effects they don't mention to you are nausea and nervousness... Try taking some dietary supplement pills/tablets and eating a healthy balanced diet. Cut back on calories and exercise at least a couple days in a week. That helped me lose weight a lot more than any patch would.
2,fake pad.,"I try this item an really it didn't do nothing for me, it was a waist of my money. I wonted to try it an i did but sorry its not for me, i have not seen any result."
1,The cover is quite decieving,"Wow, this movie is pretty bad. I'm an avid troma fan and have seen some bad movies but this one takes the cake. Its confusing, lazy and just terrible. I mean c'mon it looks like no effort was put into this. The one star is for the soundtrack, Calabrese, F.K.U, Ghoul and all the other bands are the only redeeming quality for this"
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased this bat for my son. This is not his first bat by Miken, but is the most expensive. The bat does not live up to it's name. He does not share usage of his bat, but it didn't last him three months. Yes there is a warranty, but anyone using Miken bats knows that you get one replacement. Just not worth the money."
5,The Birth of the Fed!,"This is required viewing for any die-hard tennis fan. You have the unique pleasure of witnessing here a cross-generational battle of sorts between the top-two grand slam champions. Naturally, the Nadal/Federer encounters, fought out largely from the baseline, contrast markedly to this affair, which is one of the last fine examples of serve/volley tennis. I have only become a tennis addict in the past three or four years, and I can say that watching Sampras (albeit slightly past his prime here) was a real treat. The video is worth the money alone for those who would admire Sampras' consummate serve. And yet Federer excels in this and in so many other categories, and the match is fought out with great intensity. I should add that the commentary is informative and entertaining, and it is remarkable how BBC commentator Peter Fleming mentions at one point that Federer will certainly win ""multiple Grand Slam titles"" even though he had not yet won any in 2001. Prophetic words indeed!"
4,"A good match, but nadal fed better","A good match, but the 2007 and 2008 nadal federer finals had better quality tennis in them. Dont get me wrong, sampras was a great player but the tennis in here doesnt really show it. The majority of the points are quick and nothing too exciting. This match is just a symbol, the changing of the guard, thats all. If you are looking for good quality tennis, the nadal federer finals are the ones to watch"
5,Fun!,"We got this when our daughter was around 3 months old. At that point she needed a bit extra support in the playnest (a rolled blanket or small pillow) to be propped into a stable position. Initially the colors and contrast of the nest seemed to interest her. But we would usually also give her an additional small toy to play with. When she got a bit older and able to sit better, she would interact with part of the nest like the crinkley ear on the elephant or the coiled tiger tail. It provided a great alternative to using the bouncey baby seat type activity centers. We have one of those, but it was nice to put her in something stable where she could examine and play with her feet. Now at 9 months of age we are starting to grow out of it. She had gotten more mobile and can climb out a bit too easily."
1,waste of money,"I own the playnest. In theory it would be a great product, but it is impossible to assemble. My husband and I have put together many children's toys throughout the life of our 3 year old. We really consider ourselves ""pros"". We did buy the papysan for our new baby and she loves it."
4,lovely item,I was looking for a fun colourful toy to support my little one in a sitting position. Although my baby will not be here until August after working at gymboree through my college years i know that this will be perfect and a great price!
3,Nice to hear a new release!,"One of my favorite groups, I recommend new curious listeners to get ""Open All Night"", ""Forget About The Danger"" EP, or ""Check This Action""...back when they absolutely took a back-seat to no other rockabilly/roots rock group.This long awaited CD is fun, but lacks the kick & rock-your-socks off that I was expecting. Still excellent, but nothing really stood out to me."
5,Do yourself a favor and get this CD!,"I'm home, feet up, sippin' a cold one, and listening to the first new album from the Leroi Brothers in many a moon. Life don't get much better than this. To those longtime fans who've wondered about the Lerois, don't fret: these guys are still rippin' it up in Austin with their one-of-a-kind country boogie swamp rock n' roll show. On this release, Steve Doerr and Casper Rawls have each penned some fine new songs and both play wonderful guitar. Combined with the driving rhythm section of drummer Mike Buck and bassist Pat Collins, the band grooves through 12 very cool tunes. ""Kings of the Catnap"" reaffirms the Leroi Brothers as an American musical treasure. Give it a spin and see if you don't agree. Now back to my drink and another listen."
2,Should have been better.,"This game is just OK. Therein lies the problem. This game should have been awsome. If nothing else, the graphics should have AT LEAST been as good as the original. No dice. Second, the game is just way, way, way, and I mean way too easy. Perhaps its just because my friends and I have played the first one. But still, my character died once in the first half of the game, and that was probably because we just started ignore our life after a while because we never got hurt. . . Also, they give you so much treasure that it's just pathetic. If you like that, great. I find it pretty boring to get so much treasure that you don't really have to work hard to get new items. Can I mention again how rediculous it is that the graphics in this game are worse than the original Dark Alliance game? Rent it first."
2,Big disappointment,I'm a die hard PC RPG fan. Perhaps that's the source of my disappointment. I bought an XBOX while deployed to Iraq and got star wars KOTOR (Most awsome game) and Dark Alliance 2. I've played Baldur's gate. This is not Baldur's gate. This is Diablo 3. BG is turn based combat from an angle down view. This thing's camera angle is like running around and staring at your feet and trying to find your way around. I havn't gotten to far into it yet. I will try to give it another shot if I can keep away from KOTOR long enough. Perhaps I can learn to like it if I don't try to compare it to Baldur's gate. I hate it when someone takes liberities with a well known title just to make money and destroys it. That's like putting up a taco bell but not serving any Tex/Mex food only tofu! I didn't like Diablo and I don't like this pseudo Baldur's Gate!
2,Dim Alliance,"I am a big fan of the Baldur's Gate games for the PC. They were robust games with engaging stories. Dark Alliance II is not a Baldur's gate game. This game is purely hack and slash. The story is boring, the graphics tedious and the gaming experience a complete disappointment. I can't believe I paid as much for this mess as I did for Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic. KOTOR is everything that Dark Alliance should have been.My recommendation - skip Dark Alliance II."
3,ok for the old system,this is a ok game for the xbox but it does lack a lot of the things the 360 can bring actually it boring compared to the new gameing system and games. but if your use to the xbox style of games then u will like this game.
2,Not much new...,"I'd like to say that this was a good game, but it's hard to do.First of all, I use component cables for my TV/Xbox and ran into tiles that didn't quite meet on a lot of levels. With how well the first game was put together, this came as a shock. The game was also disturbingly easy even on the Hard setting. It only took me 9 hours to beat on Hard without using any of the loopholes that are in the game.The other disappointments would have to be story itself. Where you actually had some movement in the fist game, this game is stuck in one place and when I hit the 7 hour mark in the game I had thought I was only about a 1/3 of the way through. My bad!Also, they recycled almost all of the textures from the other game. As another review on a different website said, the water effects that were so stunning in the first game now look old and dated.I guess I just expected a little more from a company that put out Knights of the Old Republic and the BG computer series and the original DA."
5,Great 360 compatible game,"This game is just plain fun if you like the top-down or ""isometric"" hack and slash type of carnage. I never really paid much attention to the story-line... I'm sure it's just dandy.What I REALLY wanted to say is don't pay 65 smackers to the sellers here- I bought it for 30 at Wally-world today.... and they had 3-4 more. Now that it's been announced as 360 compatible it's gonna be in demand, but hopefully the publisher will burn some more. Don't get ripped off. It's a great, fun game with excellent cooperative multiplayer (!!!!!) but it's not 65 bucks great."
2,Great game but bad condition,I bought this game for a higher price than i wanted an i was excited to play it as the first game is awesome. But after playing 40 minutes into the game it crashes. I have tried to clean the disc and it still crashes. The game is great but i suggest that you buy it from someone else.
2,Didn't Catch My Attention,"I found this book to be a glorified High school/College level Term Paper. Her ideas and concepts were not complete, and I was left feeling like I really didn't learn anything I didn't already know. Kate focused on the basic idea that: ""We need to see ourselves as God sees us"" (which is truly what we need to do, and some of us need to hear over and over again), however if you are looking for practical examples that focus on Conquering Intimidation, it won't catch your attention either. I wouldn't recommend buying this book, but go ahead and borrow it from a friend."
5,You might get nothing but an empty box,"I wish I could give a review on the picks but I just want to say.. ""WHERE ARE MY PICKS????"" Today I received an empty box with a piece of paper which reads ""JOE SATRIANI"", that's it. No picks, no nothing. The transparent box where my picks were supposed to be was already opened.I bought them along with 2 Avatar Blu-Rays and a Valeo Ab Wheel (No problem at all). Now I'm just waiting for Amazon to give me an answer.I will update this review as soon as I get an answer.----------------------Update: 15 minutes after submitting a complaint to the customer service department, I received an email where the Amazon staff apologize for this inconvenient. They placed a new order (charge free) and I will be receiving my picks in 2 more days.Great service!!"
1,It's bad!,"I used to play this game over my cousin's house. Besides the hideous 2D graphics, the plot must have been stolen or something because I sure couldn't find it. The gameplay wasn't as bad as the AI though. All in all, this game does start out fun but after about fifteen(15) minutes you should turn the Playstation off so it isn't left on when you fall asleep."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I wouldn't have bothered with this book if I had realized that it wasn't a romance. Most of the book was about the main character's father and establishing how cruel his was to his daughter and his wife. The small portion that actually had the hero and heroine in it did not make up for the rest of the book. Not only was it the worst SEP book that I have ever read (though Fancy Pants was close), it was not one of the better books by anyone that I have ever read.I have loved the rest of SEP's books and hope that What I Did For Love will be great."
2,I am disappointed.,"I'm a huge SEP fan but this one disappointed me. I really could care less for the first 7 chapters and the book was more about her mom than it was about Jake and Fluer. I love ""Kiss An Angel"".. That book is definitely my favorite."
3,Drama Central,"If you like to read Danielle Steel, this book will probably appeal to you. It is filled with a cast of scarred characters. Issues of ""ugly-duckling syndrome"", post tramatic stress disorder, parental psychological abuse, parental abandonment,and homosexuality are just a few items dealt with by this cast. Some characters are able to overcome and others just succumb.Even though it technically ends ""Happily Ever After"", I was left with an overwhelming feeling of sadness and could not wait to pick up another book to take my head out of this story."
1,Repulsive,"Don't even try reading this book because it sucks and its disgusting.list of CONS:1. The mother is slut2. The mother offers herself to the hero and he accepts her offer of having sex. She should get the award of mother of the year. Don't worry your little heads readers because he they never officially have sex.3. This novel was so dramatic.List of PROS:1. The Heroine started her own life after everyone tries to screw her over.Let me repeat myself, do not buy this book."
2,Couldn't even finish it.,I got 106 pages into this book and couldn't read any longer. I am dissapointed that I don't want to read anymore of it but got irritated at how slow it was moving and how weird the characters were. Just happy I didn't spend the money and buy it for my Nook.
3,An interesting beginning to a super career,"Glitter Baby was Susan Elizabeth Phillips' first contemporary novel, and it is quite different from the Avon romantic comedies many people have come to love (including me). This book chronicles the life and times of Fleur Savagar, daughter of a 1950's would-be Hollywood starlet and a certain very aging has-been former Hollywood star (read the book to find out who it is). As she grows up, she knows fame from the runways, and heartbreak from all those she loves. Yet she manages to persevere and find the happiness she deserves.Glitter Baby is very dated; the author herself has said she has no plans to reissue it for that very reason. It's not a bad book by any means, although the characters are not nearly as sympathetic or sparkling as the usual SEP fare. However, if you happen to chance upon it at a used bookstore, buy it. Besides, then you can say that you own SEP's very first contemporary."
1,awful,"I love SEP and while this may be a well written book with well drawn characters, blah, blah, blah. It was so sad, I had to put the book down a third of the way through. I couldn't finish it. The lives of the main characters were heartbreaking. It is not like SEP to write of innocent victims and lives wrenched apart by the actions of others. I went to the last chapter and the ""happy ending"" did not redeem it."
4,Enjoyable,"I read the revised, updated edition of this book. It is still a little dated, but a good read. I'd say pretty darn good for a first novel by an author I always enjoy. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good, light story."
2,First of Susan Phillips I didn't like,"I can't really pinpoint what I didn't like, but I was bored reading it. The premise is good, but then ran out of steam. Oh well, I'll just have to hope she keeps writing new ones, because I usually really enjoy her books."
1,Yuk!,I generally like SEP's books though I think her straight romances are generally better than when when she tries to channel Sidney Sheldon. But I couldn't finish this one. I was almost halfway through when I realized I did like any of the characters. SEP at her worst.
5,"Fun plot, grat characters, good summer type read.","I bought the audio book and listened to it while I was traveling. It is a fun novel, well thought out, some surprises and some typical plot lines, but all in all I enjoyed it. If you are a SEP fan, you will too. The reader did an excellent job bringing the different characters to life. If you can afford the audio version, I say go for it."
2,A little disturbing...,"I found that this book was a little different then her others and a little disturbing. I will of course read all she has to offer, but I really like the strong women in her books. This book really gave me the creeps with her step-father chasing her, mother get some from her daughters crush, eeekk! I loved the girlfriend and the brother."
3,Writing good - story bad,"Okay, I like SEP books because they are unlike other popular romance books. In SEP books, a character is never good or evil, black or white. All her characters are layered and flawed; hard to label as being pure this or total that. The storyline was not bad, it held my interest, of course, since she is such a good writer. But, I found the book to be too dark and the family dynamics to be way too bizarre. I enjoy the fantasy escape of romance novels. And SEP somehow convinces the reader that the fantasy is realistic through her expert writing. Unfortunately, I found the family members' bizarre head games with one another to be too aberrant and wierd. The father figure was too freakish and the suggestions that he made (SPOILER PERHAPS)toward the daughter was too screwy and strange and out there for me to feel comfortable when reading the book."
2,This story is not as advertised,"While I didn't dislike the story, it wasn't about Jake and Fleur. This is Fleur's mother Belinda's story. She takes it over from the beginning through the end. And since Belinda is a pretty pathetic dislikeable person, it's not that good. The story is follows the typical setup of Phillip's early books. But the fact that it's been repackaged doesn't change the fact that it's an old book and not as advertised.Too bad. Jake and Fleur are interesting characters, but they never really get the chance because 'mommy' overshadows it all."
4,"Tremendous Book, but Not a True Romance","This a great SEP book, with all of the traditional SEP elements, including family strife, unrequited love, and deep, strong character development. You truly enter Fleur's world. The only downside to this book is that there are only about 100 pages of the book that are dedicated to the romance between Jake and Fleur.SEP NEVER fails to impress, and it's a great book. I would love to have spent more time with Jake and Fleur. The relationship felt rushed, and auxillary to Fleur and Belinda's (Fleur's mom) story. In general, there was A LOT of story to be to be told, and I felt that all of the characters, and all of the relationships did not get their due time."
5,Loved it!,"This was a darker story than we're used to from SEP, I found it a fascinating accounting of human nature, at times at it's worse, and at times the human spirit shone through.People have mentioned the women as victims. I didn't see that. The mother was spineless, immature and needy, yes, but Fleur was a worthy advisory for her father once she grew up. And Fleur had a wonderfully smart, feisty friend in Kissy.Someone mentioned pedophile: no, she was 19 when this incident took place. And her father had incestuous ideas, but he wasn't her biological father, and had never been a father figure through her growing up years. He was disgustingly creepy, manipulative, cruel and perverted, though.Keeping in mind that it was first published in 1987, you have to allow for how the times have changed in how books and the modern woman are written. I think it's weathered the time well, though, and found it to be an engrossing read.I loved the story and the very interesting characters."
1,So very disappointing,"As much as I really, really like the SEP books I read previously, I just can't say much that is good about Glitter Baby. One reviewer characterized the plot as `creepy' and I agree completely. Pedophilia, near sadistic behavior, a weak, greedy mother who never matures, women-a-victims mentality, on and on. I couldn't even finish it.I understand that authors and publishers need to make money but reissuing books like this are no way to do it. This is a blight on SEP's reputation as a fine author and, if I were she, I would think twice about taking the advice of any editor who suggests reissuing any other books this-out-of date and irrelevant in today's world.This misstep is certainly not enough to turn me against SEP. I am waiting for her next new book and will once more spend my $$ in the hopes that it will be as good as all of her more recent work. But never again will I buy a reissue."
2,Is it possible?,I didn't like one single character in this book....the story left me shaking my head.
2,"Unfocused Mess, Unlike SEP","I've read all of Susan Elizabeth Phillips's novels and I think she or her agent made a mistake in reissuing this early novel of hers. The people are very one-dimensional, with only the character traits exposed that will nudge the plot along, and few of the characters behave in a realistic way. (Why wouldn't Belinda tell Fleur that the Alexi wasn't her real father? The story she did tell her was negative about Alexi anyway.) Much of this book reminds me of Judith Krantz's work: the friendship between Fleur and Kissy is a dead ringer for that between Billy and Jessica in _Scruples_ and the nastily evil father or male relative is a standard Krantz plot -- there's even a restaurant called Orsini's! It wouldn't surprise me if Krantz was one of SEP's early influences.Seriously not worth reading. Re-reading _Dream a Little Dream_, _Hot Shot_, _Nobody's Baby But Mine_, or _This Heart of Mine_ is a much better use of your time."
4,Not what I was expecting... but still interesting,"If you grab this book thinking you'll get her next romantic comedy you are WAY off the mark. This book is more of a saga. It spans 30 years in the life of a young woman and her mother and their experiences in and around hollywood and the rich and famous. This book wasn't so much a romance really, although she did give you a basic romance plot as the vehicle to carry the story through (innocent meets jaded hero, innocent preceives betrayal, years later reconciliation). But that wasn't where the weight of the emotional impact existed. The true story is between mother and daughter. All that beings said, I couldn't put the book down. The looks into the characters hearts and minds were indepth and genuine. The relationship dynamics between characters rang true. This is a quality ""women's fiction."" Worth a buy!"
4,Dated but good,"While I agree that this story is a bit dated as some previous reviewers said, it is also very well written and put together. I could not put it down, read it right through the night, something I haven't done in a long time. If you get over the dated part, you will really enjoy it. Especially if you like SEP saga romances."
3,"So-so romance, very predicticable...","""Absolute Trouble"" was a debut novel for Michelle Albert ne(with an accent egu) Jerott. The story was Ok enough. Mysterious hero who wants to avenge the death of a loved one...tough as nails former cop as a heroine who also hates the same man as the hero. The love between Dulcie and the hero felt rushed and well a bit forced. The hero definately had a one-track mind: revenge, and Dulcie should have seen that coming. The hero also is passionate about music, but moonlights as a male stripper(yeah...right...). This novel just had too many crediblity issues, and the villain, Jacob Mitsumi(""The Red Dragon"") was just too one-note(bad and has a twisted sense of honor)."
5,This book is champagne amongst the cans of Coke!,"What a great stroke of luck to chance upon this first novel by an excellent new author. She really has brought it all together: a sexy Cajun hero, a heroine who sounds like someone you'd like to be friends with, a cast of finely drawn supporting characters (including Bobby who should star in his own book), a plot that draws you right in and, to top it all off, a writing style that is a definite cut above the usual romance books out there today. If most romance novels satisfy like drinking a glass of Coke when you're thirsty I can only say that this book rates as chilled bottle of French champagne! And I can't wait for more from Michelle Jerott."
4,"friendly, simple, short songs","simple, short songs made up of singing, a loop or two, and original vocals. I've read reviews where people didn't like the vocals but I think they're lovely-as in- listening to your friend sing and enjoying the singing for what it is (no matter if it is off key) The songs often have a nice touch of humor to them and/or a nice touch of intimately sung non-cliche sadness/confusion/despair."
5,Excellent experience-based book,"This book focuses on the empirical aspect of SQL Server 7.0, rather than the internals of the engine itself. This is an excellent resource for anyone that wants to actually implement SQL Server successfully."
1,One of my worst buys this year!,"We were planning to make this book a reference for an undergraduate course in SQL Server, however we changed our minds after reviewing it... This book doesn't cover ANY subject properly: it is neither introductory nor detailed. (A Web search consistently gives me more information than using the book with index/TOC)That's a pity for the ""Unleashed"" Series."
5,Very well written and thorough,"I really enjoyed this book. I did not agree with every one of the author's statements, but I think he gave a very good, thoroughly researched account of his opinions. The main point of the book is that due to lifestyle changes over the last 30 to 40 years, living in America is like riding ""a conveyor belt to obesity"". He explores the various lifestyle factors which are contributing to our national weight gain, and talks about common-sense, do-able ways to change these factors. The main point of the book: you may be fat now, but you can definitely slim down and don't need a magic potion to do so. This is an excellent book to give a foundation of knowledge to help the reader make sense of all the diet and exercise information that continually bombards them, and separate fact from fiction."
1,Obviously the author hates fat people,"I wasn't even through the introduction when the author equated thin with handsome. The rest is just another rant on how fat people can't be healthy or beautiful. The author is just another self-hating former fat person, without a dose of reality in his work."
5,absolutely changed my life,I have recommended this book to everyone I know that is trying to lose weight. It absolutley changed my life and the way I look at fitness. It is not a diet book and it blows every diet myth of the century out of the water. I'd been trying for 8 years to lose weight and the knowlege I gained from this book made it possible. Mike Fumento is funny--I couldn't put it down.
1,fumin' fumento,"I first saw Fumento on a news magazine show. He was sitting at his desk hiding his, what I figured to be his gut, not even pretending to be interested in the reporter. He was going on about how fat everyone else is. I take it a mirror is a rare thing in the Fumento household.For some reason I took this wack o' crap out at the library. Boy was that a mistake. And you will be disapointed as well if you buy this piece of junk. Pseudo-science galore and chock full of inaccuracies. You could get better results sitting on a toilet.As I remember the interview, Fumento couldn't even speak properly. He kept mincing his words and making noises like a sick puppy. It's a wonder he received a book advance much less his high school diploma. Just goes to show you what goes for writing ability these days.I encourage you all not to buy this book. If you do, return it for a full refund."
2,"He's Written for ""The Washington Times.""","A libertarian/right-wing political writer is writing diet books. And, guess what? He blames the victims. Surprise, surprise.I could just imagine him standing over a smoker with emphysema. ""You deserve what you get, Smokey. Now check out!""This guy is the voice of reason in the battle against America's obesity problem? He peppers his ""debunking"" with insult after insult...as if making fun of fat people will mobilize them to lose weight. Yeah. That works.This guy is just a know-it-all who could stand to waddle a mile in a fatty's shoes. (Note: that last sentence is indicative of Fumento's humor and tone).Post script: Two of the healthiest cultures on earth, Eskimos and Lapps, eat almost no carbohydrates."
4,It's all about the Galaga for me,"I really bought this just for Galaga. It's my wife's favorite from the ""old days"" and we can play it for hours on end after the kids are in bed. For me that alone was worth the price, though occasionally it's fun to play Pac Man or just check out one of the other classics."
1,Never Got it,I checked the mail for two weeks it never came.. Istopped checking after that. You guys did get the money. I should have goy my product.
5,Wonderful Cookbook,"This is a wonderful cookbook. Along with great recipes, there are pictures to help guide you along the way. There are also very useful cooking and baking tips, such as why you should use unsalted butter in baking, rather than salted. One of the nicest cookbooks in my collection."
5,For The Whole Kitchen,"This was truly a great find, a cookbook that the entire family can share and with the design, you can add to it over time. Plus the access to all the product reviews is great!"
2,Americas Test Kitchen Book,Book was rather well worn and was returned for refund. Refund was quickly processed.
3,Great for a beginner....,"I am always looking for a good cook book. I love to test new recipes as well as spend the quality time cooking and baking with my children. So, when I read the reviews for this book, I thought, WOW I have to have this one! However, upon receiving it, I was disappointed at the content. It is very much for the beginner and the recipes...not exactly up my alley. I bought this before Christmas and still have yet to make one thing out of it. I am not saying ""Don't buy it."" Just get a little more info about it if you are not the beginner cook. I am planning to use one of the recipes soon though, so who knows, I may change my mind."
2,"I Was Really Excited About This Cookbook, But...","...I am so disappointed. I love America's Test Kitchen and have another of their cookbooks, which is great. But this one is awful.I have made four things from the book so far. The gingerbread cookies and the Cranberry-Balsamic dressing were fine--not great, but not awful--just average. For Christmas morning, I made the 24-hour breakfast casserole and the quick cinnamon buns. It was the worst breakfast I've ever had! The casserole was so dry and crunchy that it was barely edible (And that included my reduced cooking time. It was supposed to bake for an hour, but after 45 minutes I realized that it needed to be salvaged.) The cinnamon buns were truly awful, and we threw them away after a few bites.As many others have mentioned, the pages are far too thin. I already have several torn pages, and I've only had the book for a week.I think I might be especially disappointed because my expectations for this book were so high."
4,Basic cookbook,The cookbook provides several basic and quick recipes. There recipes tend to be light on herbs and spices but very good in preparation directions. The pictures are very helpful because they show more than the finished dish by including in process photos. I would not give this up for the Joy.
5,Beats all other general cookbooks,"I was a bit leary of buying another cookbook. I already had ""Better Homes and Gardens"" and ""Betty Crooker"" and wasn't too impressed with either book. However I saw someone write a review that said ""America's Test Kitchen"" was better than the ""Better Homes and Garden"". They were definitely correct. They have excellent tasting recipes that appeal to our more modern tastes unlike the old fasion cook books that unsuccesfully try to imitate grandmas cooking. I 100% recommend this cookbook and wish I had found it as a single guy earlier. It has top notch recipes that make me hungry even as I write this. This is the only book I've taken the time to recommend and thats only because I love the food and want everybody else to enjoy it as much as me. I sound like an promo person. Sorry."
5,Only cookbook you'll ever need.,I bought the cookbook for myself and one for my daughter.We both agree that it is the best one on the market.The recipes are easy to follow and delicious.The sections are well-arranged and put in a very logical and efficient order.The cooking tips are very helpful.It is the perfect cookbook for beginning cooks.You can't go wrong with this one.
3,I would buy this cookbook IF ONLY...,"...if only the pages weren't so terribly thin, just as other reviewers have said~even the hard cover is weak. What a shame! On all other counts, this book is excellent~wonderful recipes, great photos, and nice layout. Unfortunately, what could be the book I'd turn to most often would be in tatters within a year. Hard to believe ATK would approve of something of impractical design. I'll wait to buy in hopes of an improvement."
5,Well recommended,"This was one of the first koontzs books I bought, I still have not read Darkfall, but I hope to get round to it before long. The other two novels are excellent, with Phantoms being in my opinion the authors best book. The Servants of Twilight is also very good - it keeps you guessing until the end. Although I loved Phantoms I think it gave Dean a reputation as being a ""horror novelist"" which is untrue - all of his books are mystery thrillers, with an unusual element. He and King are so different they can't be compared. The only real horror books that he wrote were Phantoms, Darkfall, ticktock and maybe Watchers. For the most part books like Whispers, The Face of Fear, The Vision, The Voice of the night, Intensity, etc are murder, mystery and suspense basically. He is so much better than either Harris or Cornwell at writing these kind of books. My advice is buy his books NOW!"
2,too much detail,"i haven't even read this book, it is so full of confusing detail i found it hard to follow and gave up"
2,Repeat of First book,Going Home without going Crazy is just a repeat of her first book on Conflict. Not much new.
3,Cheap,"Can be found for very low prices, and works well for low-end use, but experiences problems with better hardware. For example, experiences severe issues with ATI Radeon 9600xt(usually won't boot) despite meeting system requirements for that card."
5,Great bag...I've owned a few.,I has been almost a year since i bought this bag. It is still the same as when i bought it. The stuff inside the bag does not make its way down to the bottom. Worth the money i payed.
3,"Good-quality bag, poor packing","This is a pretty nice bag. After using this bag for a couple of weeks, it has held up well and I have experienced no problems. It is solid and the stuffing seems pretty uniform.There is no chain supplied for the bottom of the bag as shown in the picture - just a loop. I am not impressed with the quality of the chains on the top of the bag - they look like they came from a chandelier.Also, the packing left a lot to be desired. The bag was in a cardboard box with no packing materials except for a 6"" X 6"" piece of bubble wrap! The chain was just rattling around loose in the box. Still, this is a good-quality bag at a pretty good price."
1,"650 mg of sodium is NOT ""Low Sodium"" in my books.","Unless the link to ""nutrition"" is incorrect, I cannot believe that a soup that gives you 27% of your daily max of sodium in a half cup serving can be called ""Low Sodium""!!! Some people with health issues are targeting a daily max of only 1000 mg. This is deceptive advertising!!"
2,Tiny cans,"I ruined a can of this soup because I added water & milk to it.Now why did you do that???Because these cans are actually *smaller* than the cans of condensed cream of mushroom soup made by Campbell's.10.5 oz compared to 10.75 oz for the condensed soup. 18.6 or so for the regular soup.So I never thought twice about adding water & milk because of the small size of this can. Should've read the label, I know.Anyways, you'd have to open 2 of these tiny cans to equal the amount of soup that you get in a regular can of cream of mushroom soup.At this price, I'll never find out if this low sodium version really tastes as good as the +900mg of sodium version. But judging by the fact that I had to mail order that can since none of the stores in my neighborhood here in Los Angeles is carrying this particular low sodium soup, I doubt it."
5,One of my favorite products,"I have dry skin and am allergic to many substances, but this product has always worked for me. It's not so much unscented as unperfumed: it has a mild, clean smell. It keeps my skin soft and smooth. I've used it since I was a child and I will use it until I'm old and wrinkled, but for now it is keeping the wrinkles at bay."
1,"It says it's unscented, but it's not!","I understand that there's probably no way to make a truly 100% unscented soap. But I don't know how Dove gets by with calling this soap unscented. To me, it has a strong, unpleasant, almost chemical smell. I won't purchase it again. I'll be looking elsewhere for a lighter scented ""unscented"" soap."
5,"Steady, stable advice.","In the late 90's, everyone wanted to use astronomical capitalization rates to value a business, claiming they were warranted by the high total returns from small cap stocks during that period. Horn said no, don't do it. This is a temporary phenomenon, a blip in time. Look at the market historically, as a whole, from 1929 until today. If you commit to deals based on those cap rates, you'll be sorry. Well, guess what? He was right and everyone else was wrong. We all got killed by following the herd.There are a lot of books in print about this subject, and I've examined most of them. Most seem to be poorly-written knock-offs of Horn's work, to which they have added their own unfortunate personal notions about value, so I'd counsel you to stick with Horn's book - it's probably the best, most stable advice you can get on business value."
5,great book - reliable info,"I have several books on this subject, and this one is probably my favorite. I've done many, many valuations and found that the more esoteric books on the topic don't seem to produce better results than the ""tried and true"" methods in this manual. There are also quite a few books, aimed at the layman, that oversimplify the subject - but there's no danger of that here. You will find this book both very accessible and technically complete. Highly, highly recommended."
2,Not good for tech companies,This is a good book but if you are a tech company do not buy it as it is designed for small traditional business's.
4,Good Book; But You May Need Prerequisites,"This is an excellent book for gaining ideas for the process of a business valuation.The reader may need an accounting or finance background or experience in a related field in order to comprehend some of the concepts in the book. One of the chapters (Chapter No. 10) has concepts related to the time value of money. The reader needs to be familar with the mathematical concepts used in business finance.Presumably, anyone purchasing this book would have experience working with financial calculations.The book is a bit high-priced. However, it contains a lot of information relevant to business valuation methods."
4,Easy to read - good beginning,"Covers quite a number of valuation methods, some of which are not widely used. Easy to read, well organized primer written non-academically."
4,Vividly told and personalized dedication,"It's like a painting of an era of truthful experience of life and friendship, between Norman Malcolm, the author and Ludwig Wittgenstein, the philosopher, where honest intellect fulfilled the most part of it. Being a respectful philosopher, a deadly serious lecturer, mostly, an intellect vigorously searching for truth and nothing else, Ludwig Wittgenstein is certainly living vividly through out this memoire."
5,A rare insight,"I just watched ""Pistol Packing Mama:Missions of a B17"" in my History of Warfare class and came here to buy a copy for myself.. Suffice it to say that I completely agree with the other reviews.As luck would have it, the navigator Lt. Colonel Mencow is a student in my class. It was a rare treat to watch the film and have the opportunity to speak to one of the crewmembers about his experiences.I highly recommend the film."
2,Not As Nice As We Had Hoped,The smell is not as nice as it sounds and the bars are too big for your hands.
2,No thanks.,"The GBA version of Namco Museum 50th Anniversary has only 5 games, not 14 -- Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaga, and Rally-X is all you get. The other games mentioned in Amazon's description are not present. Wouldn't gripe about that if the games it has were playable, but control is awful. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man require being very precise with up/down/left/right. Dig Dug actually jerks and pauses with the music cutting out during gameplay. Galaga is worth playing, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. Also, hitting [select] rotates the graphics 90 degrees for arcade aspect ratio; maybe that's an important feature for some.A better collection for the GBA is the regular Namco Museum (NOT 50th Anniversary). No Rally-X, no Pac-Man, but you get the other three games plus Galaxian (quite good) and Pole Position (quite lame). The version of Ms. Pac-Man has more forgiving control, and its Dig Dug plays great."
2,a pretty good game..............,"I am 14 and I bought this game because i like all the old arcade games like the ones that are on this game which are dig-dug,Mrs. pacman,pacman,and rally-x. but the only bad thing is that there wasn't many arcade games on this game. That is the only reason that i gave this two out of five stars."
3,"Not as good as the first, but still worth the read.","I didn't feel this book was as funny as the first; in fact it was slow getting into the story and Ainsley's character really got on my nerves because she became a crazed Martha-Stewart-clone. However, it was still a good read, and I think all Rene Gutteridge fans will enjoy it."
4,Not as Scary As It Sounds.,"This book is a wonderful continuation for the Boo series. There are lessons to be learned, and the writing is very quirky. These books remind me of a Christian version of Gilmore Girls. Everyone is in every body else's business and such, small town humor. My copy came in in very good condition."
5,Worth every penny!,"My old Craftsman finally gave so I needed to buy something ideal for my wife and I to use at home. The drill is awesome, it runs smoothly, provide light with you're using it, small & compact and easy to understand (perfect for my wife to use - she gets intimidated with power tools except this one), and the charge lasts for a very long time. It'll even tell you when you need to recharge it through its battery gauge. So far, I've used it to screw sheet rock, install basic lighting and wall outlets, drill and screw a couple of 2x4s and sx12s, even a 4x6. I can't wait to use it on building a bookcase. If you're needing a great all around drill for your home, don't look any further."
4,"Nice and Light, easy to use, better than Craftsman",This one is much lighter than my old Craftsman 14.4 Volt. Best part is the Lithium Ion Battery. Has power light pointing to where the drill is aimed at. Just wish it had a level to check if it was completely horizontal/vertical.
3,Not as great as it could be,"This bag is a bit stiff and it didn't have a lining inside. The interior is made of some type of plastic and I didn't know that when I ordered it. Also, I didn't know that it didn't have a zippered pocket on the back (I really wanted that pocket), but I didn't feel like returning it for refund because I had just returned a different bag because it didn't have the organizer that this bag has.All in all, I decided to make the bag over by putting a lining inside it and sewing some additional pockets on. It's still stiff but after it gets used more often maybe it will began to feel like my older messenger bag that was wonderful (and I can't find another one like it anywhere). I disassembled that old bag and parts of it is now sewn onto this new bag. Crazy, huh."
4,Decent solid Bag,"Good width, nice stiff fabric makes it easier to get stuff inside. The bag's NOT canvas which is why it's stiffer but its more durable that way. Front organizer is really helpful but also narrow so it doesn't bulk up the bag - if you wanna cram a lot into the organizer i recommend buying a little pouch to toss inside like those cloth pencil cases.Most messenger bags are wide and narrow. This bag is lightweight and has decent depth to it to fit more of my junk. Surprisingly roomy and easy to lug - it feels like it'll last me a long time."
5,Another great recording!,Nils guitar work is amazing on this. The solos on Daddy Dream and Deadline scream! The classic Nils album.
3,try again,"I've loved this album for years and was happy to see it available on CD.Upon the first play the sound quality immediately struck me as very shallow and hollow, I was quite disappointed. I'll just record the LP to CD myself, it will sound better."
3,A great gift for the music lover in your family,"A gift for my son-in-law, a middle school orchestra conductor and a viola player. It is a beautifully done CD."
2,"Somewhat informative, but juvenile","This book reminded me of the biographies on Roberto Clemente and Teddy Roosevelt that I used to pick up in elementary school, but with slightly more technical subject matter. There are some interesting stories about Delbruck's life and discoveries, but these are written in a juvenile manner and the book does not live up to its title - very little discussion of the impact of molecular biology on other scientific fields or society in general is provided. The important experiments of Delbruck, Luria, and others are also described poorly. There are much better books on the origins of molecular biology. For some fun, hagiographic info on Delbruck this might work - for anything more, it won't."
5,great fun!,"We love to have friends over for game night, and this has become one of our favorites. It is laugh out loud fun."
3,Shouldn't have messed with a great game,Outburst Remix is not as much fun as the original. The cards are smaller but the hand-held card reader is better. The cards now have a Title and a subtitle. But don't count on the title for any clues - it's useless. Also the catagories are way to specific. Stick with the original...it a little dated...but great fun going down memory lane.
3,Alright game,"This game is kind of fun, but it gets frustrating when you give an answer that is obviously right but is not on the card. The point, briefly, is to get a category and guess all 10 items in that category on the card. We played one game the way it's meant to be played, then had a free-for-all with the cards for the rest of the night, seeing if the whole group could beat the timer.All in all, I don't know if I'd buy it again. It's all up to the individual, I guess."
4,Good book for experienced cake decorators,"This is a great book for experienced cake decorators. If you are a novice, I wouldn't recommend it. I do wish that some of the instructions were a little more precise, but the pictures and illustrations are great and therefore it was easy enough to figure out. The first cake I made out of this book was the chameleon cake for my son's birthday. It was a really fun cake to make and he and the guests at his party loved it. All of the cakes pictured in this book are so fun, and I hope that I will have opportunities to make each and every one!"
1,"This book is mainly a catalogue, not a master class book as the title states","When I bought this book, I though it was going to be very instructional and as the name says that it was going to be a Master Class, I was very disappointed, this book is only a catalog of the cakes Colette is able to accomplish and photos on how they looked.In terms of learning it does not provide anything, there is very little explaining, no step by step instructions nor photos for the whole construction process (which would be needed due to the complexity of the designs presented), recipes range from 80 guests to up to 200.I guess the author wasn't even interested in scaling the recipes for ""regular"" cooks.If you want only to look at the pictures, then you can visit her website, if you want to actually learn then this is not for you."
2,Coffee Table Book,"I think the cakes are wonderful and photos stunning but this, in my opinion, is not a ""how too"" book. The details in decorating are sparse and certainly are not intended to allow for reproducing the work or any variation of it.If you choose to purchase this fine work, realize you are doing it to see the photos not to learn the techniques."
1,"""Dream On"" are the operative words","While I concede that this book is stunning to look at, Colette Peters does not want you to learn how to make these cakes. The cake decorating instructions are vague and absurdly simplistic in the extreme; general discussion of technique (painting, molding, color-mixing) is either absent or useless in its brevity. Even some discussion of brands of food coloring or gum-paste would have been useful, as the success of these cakes utterly depends on the subtle color hues and graceful sculpturing of fondant and gum-paste. If you enjoy cake decorating, I suggest you get this book out of the library to appreciate the photos. But if you want to develop your skills, do not purchase this book. This is another narcissistic venture by Colette Peters."
3,Good for display.,"I bought this book for my collection and to display. I have a lot of cookbooks and this is BY FAR the best looking. I display it front and center and it never fails to garner comments.On the other hand - it is for experts only. I bake a lot - a lot. And I routinely do some very fancy desserts, but the decorating in this book is way out of my league.Pretty to look at, other than that - way out of the league of most of us."
3,Take Head of the warnings!!!,"I have to agree with the very first, well written review. This book is beautiful and if you already know what you're doing, it can offer some helpful ideas for the cakes that she does. However if you are a novice or new to the cake decorating field, you'd be lost. I wish I would've waited until I had a little more experience with stacking cakes because even though this book claims to direct you through that process, it really does not do a good job with the childish illistrations it provides. The pictures of the cakes are beautiful, but the templates really do nothing because there is no instruction on how to use them to decorate your cake. I would advise that if you are looking for something that is more instructional and helpful, keep looking and pass this one up (for now). Splurge on this book once you've become familiar with all of the tools that she expects you to have and know how to use."
5,Beautiful Idea Book,"I bought this book as an idea book and got exactly what I paid for. It is well put together with plenty of descriptions of techniques and methods. It is definitely not for a beginner, but Colette Peters doesn't make beginner-type cakes! For those who are professionals or those who aspire to be, I think this book is full of great ideas to inspire you. Her style is a bit too whimsical and artistic to be in demand where I live, but I have already used a few of the ideas from this book in cakes of my own design."
2,Not a How to Book,"I thought that the price meant that I would be getting great information on how to make a 4 tier cake. What I got was a book full of amazing cakes, with little direction. They were very over the top. The price was way too much for this book. I also bought the Wimsical Bakehouse with this one and it was alot less but came with alot more information about how to make these cakes. I gave it two stars for the fact that her cakes are breath taking, but the content was a big let down."
4,Gorgeous coffee table book :),"I love to get this book out to just look at the beautiful pictures. Sometimes I use it for inspiration though. It is not really an instructional book per se. There are ""directions"" for making the cakes but you really have to be very experienced already."
2,"If her style is not your thing, then this book is not a ""masterclass""","The subtitle of this book makes it sound like it is going to be very comprehensive when it comes to technique. But unfortunately it is really a gallery of (in my opinion... and I know she has a lot of fans out there) over-the-top, carnival-inspired, topsy-turvy cakes with only very general guidelines on how to make them. Also, because she doesn't do more classic and elegant cakes, her designs tend to look dated quickly.The last 20 pages or so of the book are about actual technique, but I don't feel like those 20 pages justify the price of the book.Obviously Colette is an amazing artist, but I prefer Toba Garrett's ""The Well Decorated Cake"" and Kate Sullivan's ""Kate's Cake Decorating"" for actual instructions and more timeless designs."
3,Not crazy about it....,"Although a really fun book to look at & be inspired it does not give very much instructional information which is what I was seeking at the time.But, as a photo book for inspiration it's tops - although I could have been just as inspired looking at images on the net."
2,Coffee Table Book II,"I agree with D. Fletcher. This is a ""Coffee Table Book"" fun to look at but not a ""How To"" book. It shows off Peters beautiful talent as a decorator but it is not a learning book per say."
5,"Beautiful, beautiful book. Another Colette Peters must-have.","She just keeps getting better and better. Beautiful cakes with FRESH ideas that you can easily incorporate into your own creations. Great use of color, and wonderful new ideas for gumpaste, fondant and royal icing. Fabulous inspiration."
1,Not What I thought,I borrowed this from the library before I bought it. Thank Goodness. If is no way a learning book and way to much money for what is taught. I think the cakes are way to gaudy. I even showed two neighbors the book and they totally agreed.
1,Cake catalog only.,"There is very little explaining, no step by step instructions nor photos for the whole construction process. Mediocre baker who needs more help with the technical side."
3,"Creative fun, but not for anyone less than advanced","It is no surprise that Colette Peters is incredibly talented as both an artist and pastry chef, but ""Cakes to Dream On"" is not for the casual baker. This book would probably work best for an excellent cake maker who perhaps is looking for a little more creative inspiration, as opposed to the creative, but mediocre baker who needs more help with the technical side."
3,cake decorator,"Cakes extremely too difficult to recreate except for a professional. Very little detail given in the art of doing it. Great pictures and beautiful creations just not practical. Very little helpful know how explained. Does include pattern for the detail work which is helpful but you have to enlarge them and not all directions are included. When it says ""Master"" class, you better be a ""Master Cake Decorator"" cause other wise you just have a book to collect."
3,K.M Acevedo,I'm very happy with this product. Jamie Foxx is straight guts!!!It just took a little bit longer than I expected for the cd's to get here. Will do business again.
3,Scratch,"The package's general condition is good. However, one of the movies is scratched. The first day i played it, it froze on one part, and now it does the same thing every time. I'm hoping I can fix it with some alcohol or something."
2,For Beginners ONLY!,"This video is strictly for beginners. It starts with taking the flute out of the case and putting it together, to some minor notes. It does cover some basic music theory, covering notes, rests, how to read basic music and does have three songs but is not very clear in the order of notes that you should play. For a VERY beginner age level 3rd grade and up. It is a low budget film even though it is from Warner Bros."
4,Everybody's Dead! (Oh No!),"A great album by a great band. Wckr Spgt is terribly underappreciated, and I highly recommend anything and everything you can find by them."
5,Not disappointed...AT ALL,"I thought I'd check it out. And I WAS NOT disappointed. Sometimes you get disappointed, you know? You think, well, I don't know -- maybe. And then you listen and you're all, oh man... NOT THIS TIME. And I listened and I was even happier than I'd hoped. Get yourself this CD, and a Poochy Woman, and feel good about yourself."
5,The Number One Goal Keeping Manual For Any Serious Keeper,"Lincoln Phillips is one of the outstanding teachers of the game today. He brings a warm and open presence to the subject, revealing the secrets to playing the position with a common sense approach that is guaranteed to bring success. This is a must-have addition to any coaches or players library."
3,Not Bemis wicks,"These filters are not Bemis filters, they are made by another company. They fit and work fine in the Bemis humidifier, but they should not be listed (or priced) as Bemis filters. Seller graciously refunded a portion of my payment due to the misleading information in the product listing."
5,Positive Thinking Every Day,"Book was a gift for my daughter. She loves it. Focusing on the positive things in life truly lifts the spirit.Book arrived within a week, great condition!"
2,Not what I was expecting...,"This is a very small book that is more like a daily calendar with a one sentence thought for the day every day. I was looking for something with at least a paragraph for every day, so it wasn't quite what I wanted."
1,Maybe for a picnic!,"I won't throroughly lambaste this set because it was only $25. However, I purchased it because another reviewer stated that it is very ""heavy and sturdy"". When I received the package, I was very surprised that it weighed so little! This is the type of flatware that may bend if too much force is applied. It might be nice for a picnic or outing, or as an extra set that rarely gets used, but I would caution against purchasing it for everyday use. I hope this helps."
3,Good for everyday use,"I just want to add to existing reviews that this product looks differently in real life than it appears on the picture in Amazon item description. It is not made of silver nor has silver coating, just pale plain stainless steel.I give 3 stars only because description is misrepresented - this is not real silver looking as shown on the picture."
1,Not Worth the Price,This is the worst set of flatware I have ever purchased. The description is so misleading. I've already replaced it. Don't even think about eathing ice cream with it. It bends easily. This is a set that easily could be picked up at the dollar store for a buck. Please don't waste your money. Thank God the shipping was free.
5,Great flatware at a great price,"i bought this flatware on sale for 25 dollars and i was expecting some cheap set that wouldn't have a nice heavy feel to it, but this set was not only beautiful, but is very heavy and sturdy. I expect to have this set for a long time. About two years ago I bought some other flatware that really just fell apart and so now I think i will be good for quite a few years."
1,"I love Lawrence, but Synergy gets an ""F""","First of all, why is the video on these DVD's so poor? These shows should not have to be displayed as kinescopes, as they were taped. And worse yet, the show switched to color in 1965. So the shows from 1965 on are not only not in color, but they are kinescopes of color programs.Add to this attrocity that Synergy has elected to put a ""Synergy"" logo bug in the lower right hand corner of the screen, thus making a bad picture even a bigger mess. (The website DVD Talk has some screen captures within their review that should help give an idea of the poor quality and the screen bugs.) I contacted Synergy, and they gave me the lame excuse that they used the bug to keep people from stealing their transfers.So sad, as I would love to have some quality copies of this great, classic show by this great orchestra leader."
3,Good memories,"Music reproduction good, but picture lousy, like what we saw from Kinescopre shows in the early 50's.Surely there must have shows that were taped during the period these shows were aired."
3,Black & White,I'm not sure if the star rating apply here. I have not watch the shows as I returned the set as soon as I realized the DVDs are black and white. I would like Amazon to add this to the item description.
1,It looks like it's in color doesn't it,"I got this for my elderly husband who is ill and mostly just lying on a couch. It turned out they're black and white. Not any indication ahead of time, since the cover looks like it's in color. The description didn't say."
3,X-com is much better.,"I have a love hate relationship with this game.First off, if you enjoyed this game, I would HIGHLY recommendX Com, UFO defense. You will NOT be dissapointed.Pro's:Portable X-Com!,Fun Tactics,Great for long drives or trips,Con's:Can be frustrating at time's,( hey thats with any game, right?)I Thought it was too short,Earlier I said I have a Love-Hate relationship with this game.The reason being, I've been exremely blessed to have played thegame that inspired Rebel Star Tactics, ( X-com, UFO Defense).After playing this GBA game, I felt somewhat unsatisfied.Not because of the game, but what it could have been.Not having the ability to name your soldiers, Build your own bases, hunt down UFO's and research new weapons and shipslike X-Com was saddening.Overall I would recommend RebelStar..Just don't expect TOO much from it."
5,I love this game,"The games graphics are a bit dated by this point but the game has a lot of depth; RPG Stats, lots of strategy, open ended play, and all on the GBA/DS compatabile. This game is better than most DS games. I really got into this game and enjoyed it for hours. If you like the original XCom or turn based games you'll love this."
5,Wonderful Read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. The tribulations the author has experienced are almost unbelievable, but the story is heart-wrenching and well-written. I am an avid reader of all genres, and I would recommend this novel to anyone."
5,The best little book I have read in years.,"The fifth miracle is an outstanding little book that discloses a miriad of possibilities about the origin of life on earth. The controversy arises when Davis exposes some unorthodox theories like Panspermia, the truth is that when he does that he is really persuasive. Paul Davies is an intelligent scientist and one that has kept updated and with experience on field, so his arguments are no less than powerful and convincing, once again, even the controversial ones. Though he doesn't take part in most of the different theories explained, his book might look a little biased, but great, besides he may even be right."
5,Paul Davies gives us the State of the Art on this subject,"The origin of life is one of the major puzzles that science is trying, since the dawn of human history, to solve. Paul Davies illustrates most clearly what results humanity has been able to glean by evidence, observation, experiments and thought. A must read for both the interested layman and the professional. One of Paul Davies' best books.Most notable for his emphasis on the problem of the origin of information stored in the DNA."
2,Not worth the low price,You have a choice of five different camera angles. One in particular puts you right next to the ball where you get to follow it at a dizzying pace. This is where the positive comments end.You have a choice of three tables but there are hardly any differences between them except for the titles and the music. It's a boring attempt at smacking the ball up different ramps for boring bonuses. There is absolutely no originality in the table design. Pinball machines from the 70's offer more variety.Customization is nil except for the music and sound volume. You can't even adjust the number of balls (you get three). The gravity of the tables is set too high in my opinion as it's very difficult to get the balls up the ramps. Ten minutes is about the most even a devoted video pinball fan will be able to stand.Get Big Race USA Pinball or Fantastic Journey instead - much better choices.
5,Love these ...,Very handy and sturdy. Lots of competition at my home for them so I bought two sets so that we always have some available.
3,pretty good,it's pretty expensive compared to other similar velcro. wish it was slightly wider. but definitely like that there is variety of color in the pack
5,masterpiece to learn booker's style,a must have if you want to learn the rich and complex booker style. Joshua Paxton's job with these transcriptions is just perfect!
2,Not what I expected...,"It didn't work for me, being for children I would expect it to light up or make noises,I though that being a timer you could set the time needed and at the end you would hear or see a light to indicate your child time was up."
2,Good but not great.,"Another interesting book from Osprey, this one suffers from a few annoying flaws. The author starts the book with a several page digression into the political and social situation in German at the time of the Second World War. Interresting perhaps, but it has nothing to do with the subject of the book, and it wastes too many of the already limited number of pages.Then, when he finally gets to the actual subject matter, the author attempts to use a poorly executed and inconsistently implemented first-person narrative to describe the training undergone by German Paratroopers. As usual the best part of any Osprey book is the illustrations, but ever here they are not quite up to the standards of most of the other titles in this series.Overall, while the title does provide some useful information on the subject, there are better books available."
5,Big Help,I had to study for the RE exams and this was a big help. I downloaded it on my Ipod and whenever I am on the bus or train or relaxed I would listen to it. I did pass my RE exams on the first try.
3,Not quite what I expected,Good book but not quite what i was looking for. Did not help me with my exam that i was expecting.
4,Language of Real Estate,"just what i needed in my real estate business. Very complete resource, It is consulted on a daily basis and is a great learning tool"
5,Very happy,The item was received promptly and in great condition. It was purchased as a gift for my father.
5,Don't think - Just get,"If you've been wanting the entire 007 set of DVD like I have, don't even think about buying this, just get it! This set is amazing. All the movies look incredible on my HDTV. I've never seen Dr. No or From Russia With Love look so good. Not to mention they're also in DTS, which makes me very said I don't have a DTS receiver.Each film has the movie on one disc, then all the bonus features on another disc. The only thing thats a little annoying about this set is the movies aren't in chronological order. I rearranged the films in the four cases to be in chronological order though."
4,Needs to be Blue Ray now,Great product at a great price but needs to be upgraded to a blue ray as well as added a copy of Casino Royale 2006.
5,What a bargain,This set came with hours of James Bond entertainment. Each set includes a movie selection from the various decades. We've had a great time watching the action and adventures.
5,Great set at a great price!,The latest DVD collection is top-notch and high quality with good extras.
4,"Movies are great, packaging is ""meh""","The dvd cases are small, and the ""ultimate edition"" pamphlets for each movie are separate from the dvds themselves (since the cases are not the regular size).I can understand why, given there are 20 movies, but it's kinda nice to be able to show them all off."
2,Skip to the end.,This book was a long story that boils down into one sentence where he says he saw bigfoot. I think it is a book about hiking and camping more than anything. I would not buy it again and i will not read it again.
1,In pursuit of things to complain about,"I was excited to get this book, I thought great! a book written about my area! Little did I know that in his quest to save the wilderness from horses and horse poop the author felt the need to change ALL of the locations and place names. Anyone in this book who rides a horse or carries a gun in the woods is automatically damned as unfit for the authors wilderness to which he is brand new himself! This is not a good book for those interested in bigfoot or research."
4,Not all that dark...,"This book showed what people have called a ""dark"" outlook on the future of the net. Yes, its more restrictive but a main point of the book is that there is some control left to be determined.This is a more realistic view of what the Internet is going to be then anything else I've heard, and I would suggest reading this book to anyone who is intrested in the future of the Internet."
3,"Good points, but dry and dull","There's no doubt that Lessig is brilliant and knows his material. However, his standpoint is from Constitutional Law, and doesn't incorporate more views of Intellectual Property into his arguments. As a Harvard boy myself, I even find his viewpoints too right-coast for me. And it's too American focused. My only complaint is I still haven't bought into the EFF et al view of the Internet being free and utopic. You sort of have to subscribe to that underlying belief system in order to fully accept Professor Lessig's ideas. The reading is dry as well and not meant for casual reading. It's perfect for any MBA or JD program covering ""cyberspace""."
5,Important Insights Life in Cyberspace,"Rather than add to the volumes that have already been written regarding this important work, I'd note that despite the fact that Lessig thoughtfully covers vexing foundational constitutional issues regarding privacy, sovereignity and property rights etc.. in cyberspace, he does so in a manner that is straighforward, compelling and which inspires further thought and disucssion. In other words it was very readable.I found myself often putting the book down to discuss a point made by the author with friends and colleagues, I'm thinking that's exactly what Lessig intended.While I may have my differences on several issues, this book is fundamntal reading for those interested in the impact of our emerging cyber-society."
1,Title is totally misleading! Nothing from Van Halen+DLR era.,"The title of this dvd is completely misleading. ""Van Halen - The David Lee Roth Years"" would lead one to believe that this would be a documentary about the band Van Halen during their initial period with David Lee Roth as their frontman/lead vocalist, or contain footage from that era, or contain interviews with band members/industry insiders about that era of the band. It doesn't contain any of that. It is entirely made up of interviews DLR did with various media types AFTER his split with Van Halen. I think the name ""Van Halen"" only came up once during the whole dvd."
1,A Complete Waste...I Feel Stupid !!,"As a Van Halen Fanatic, I went against my better judgement after reading these other reviews and bought it anyway< because I am such a complete collector. What a waste of money!! Do NOT WASTE YOUR MoNEY !! Period!! A complete rip-off. Buyer Beware !!"
1,Misleading & POOR quality,"This DVD is A JOKE! Most of the interviews only discuss Roth's solo work, with barely a mention of Van Halen. There is no visual Van Halen content AT ALL. Also, the picture quality ispoor, and the editing must have been done by a 3 year old. A TOTAL waste of money, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
1,RIP OFF,"This DVD is a complete rip-off, waste of money DO NOT BUY! All it is David Lee Roth interviews (4)after Van HalenIt has NOTHING to do with Van Halen, and Amazon and the makers of the DVD are MIS-LEADING the consumers.That should be illeagal!!!My mistake was not reading the reviews, but still it shouldn't say ""Van Halen Years"". Unless you wantpost DLR interview to waste money on, this is a RIP OFF. AMAZON, you should be ashamed for selling this travisty and mis leading the public!!!"
1,all talk....no action,"The most boring, egomaniacal drag. No music, just Dave Dave Dave, as though Van Halen would be nothing without him. Wasted my money on this one!"
5,Black/Death Metal to it's max,"If you like the eighties dark/black metal, you will love this. If you have the Zao disc, ""Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest"", at times you could compare the vocals to the vocals of Daniel Weyendt. The other vocalist on the record has an awesome eighties vibrato like that of stryper. They even have flute on the disc. It's a must. Very powerful lyrics. They are from Norway."
4,very good...,"for a first abulm.It's mostley black metal with some death in there and even a little power metal too.I realy like the lyrics,and the music is real good.Plus they are one of my favorite christian metal bands."
1,this cd sounds like a bunch of cows dying,"one word SUCKS.i dont why all these other guys thought tis band was cool but they arent.extremly cheesy music.it sounds like 80's metal.and the vocals really stink.they sound all scratchy,like they need to clear their throte or something.80's metal music and screamingn does not mix.this bands music is what makes me think theyre so sorry.to me the music is not hard at all.and to me the vocals are extremly annoying buy at your own risk"
1,"Is he throwing up, dying, and singing?",I bought this CD and It sucks. It sounds like these norway people and dying throwing up and singing at the same time. How do you know their christian if you can't hear what their saying. This is not the CD to buy.
4,"Different, but good","First off, this band is for the adventurous listener. The vocals take some getting used to. Their sound is unique but after a few listens your ears adapt to the almost demonic shrieks of the lead singer. I found it hard to listen to the entire disc at once, as the songs tend to sound the same after a few tracks. This band has potential and with some developement, should be around for a while."
5,this band rocks,"I saw these guys live and they rocked. I would recomend this cd to anyone who likes death metal music.If you ever get the chance to see this band live, GO! You wont be disapointed. And you wont be if you get this cd"
5,review of cardiology,"The book is just FANTASTIC. The reproduction of heart sounds is something absolutely necessary for the physician, but you cannot find real patients to hear all of these sounds. The addition of the CD, with this and other very important features is just too impressive to describe.The best cardiology book I have ever read. In a scale of 1 to 10, it scores 20."
2,Not the best cardiology book written!,"I was seeking out a review on cardiology and thought this book would be great for what I was looking for. This wasn't the case however. I found the book too long, too wordy and found only 25% of the book useful for what I needed. The book included a CD which I found more impressive than the book itself. If you are looking for reading/reviewing information on a particular part of cardiology, seek out a different book a little more specific to your needs."
3,So so,"I love the MRS series - anything that's ""made ridiculously simple"" is always welcome in my collection. This book was pretty disappointing in comparison to others in the series though. Probably more helpful for 3rd and 4th year rotations and residency than BMS."
2,Not for nurses,"The product description states that this book works for nurses and other health care professionals other than MDs. I have been a nurse for 5 years, and I have difficulty following this book. Definitely not ""ridiculously simple."""
4,Excellent Cardiology Book Review by Dr. James Thogtam,"DR. Chizner's book is the most well founded and delightful book to read. As a former clinical professor in nursing, this book is the only one nurses will need. Do not waste your money on other books, this one is the best. All nurses who practice cardiology on any level, should buy this book. It is a keeper for life!Please tell any cath lab, critical care, or cardiology nurse about this book. And for those who are going for the CVN or CCRN exam, this book will help you pass the exam! It has every aspect of knowledge needed for cardiology. This book will help you become a top flight respected nurse in the clinical arena for sure!"
4,Nice book,Good overview of general cardiology. Most students and interns will find it very helpful in covering the basics of cardiology. A bit basic for advanced readers
5,Easy cardio read,"Cardio has always been one of my weaker subjects, primarily because I find it boring and over-complicated in many texts. This book is a pleasure as it does not over-complicate issues and moves slowly. Although at times it feels as if the book is flying through subjects paragraph by paragraph, it often re-iterates itself and defines terms that can be frequently forgotten. The simplistic figures are a nice visual assist in remembering various concepts. I think I can actually retain the JVP wave forms after six years of medical education.Overall, I recommend this book. Keep in mind when reading my review, that cardio is my weak subject, I am not a cardiologist and I suspect it may be over-simplified for those into cardiology. However, I think it would suffice for any clinical rotation at any level (except cardio fellowship)."
5,Understandable Cardio,Great book; makes cardio actually comprehensible. I really appreciate the authors' encouraging doctors to listen & use clinical skills more & rely on expensive testing less.
3,some parts of this book are not made simple,"This is a great idea, and helpful to certain folks. I find that some of the topics are not well defined in detailed areas in the chapter. It is not really ""simple""- and should be consistently simple throughout the book as it is intended. Too many cartoon type characters."
5,Easy Read for Clinical Understanding,"I am a first year medical school student and I purchased this book before beginning the review of the cardiovascular system. This book was very helpful in giving me clinical perspectives, however I was slightly disappointed it did not contain any physiology (making me have to get a separate book to review cardio-phys). Overall, I would recommend this book to any individual thinking about going into cardiology, it is an easy read."
4,Really finding this book helpful,"We are using this book in a group at our church as a tool to help us learn how we might use St. Benedict's Rule to guide our daily lives. We're finding the exercises a great help and the book has become the tool we're using to build a ""community of the heart""."
3,Too Christocentric!,"This book assumes that the Christianity is central to the reader's life. Although there are some good general points, the Christocentrism renders them practically useless for those of other faiths. Perhaps this was the author's intention, but I believe she could have made it inclusive without sacrificing the integrity of the book."
5,Touches the soul. Doris,This is a book you'll want to talk about with your friends. You learn about what the author has seen out of his body and what the Lord is like when he met Him.
5,Amazed,During the time of turmoil going on now this book is a wonderful change. I could not put it down.
2,Returned it.,"If you're looking to create a classic wedding, this might be more helpful for you, but it was too classic-religious to help with the wedding I was planning.Judith Johnson's ""The Wedding Ceremony Planner: The Essential Guide to the Most Important Part of Your Wedding Day"" was perfect for our needs, however. Everyone was raving about the beautiful cerermony =)"
2,A Good Effort,"I did not find the arguments in this little book to be much use to me, although perhaps others will. There is not enough information on any of the topics to really substantiate the points that the authors make. In fact, I think that if someone tried to use this book as a primary tool in a conversation with an intelligent and well-educated New Ager or atheist, he would be pretty much shredded. On the other hand, the type size was nice and big."
2,NEEDS CD,"What isn't said here is that the course is incomplete without the CD-ROM, which isn't included and isn't available even from routledge. In fact, I would say that without the CD-ROM the book shouldn't even be sold, but apparently the folks at Routledge disagree."
3,EVERY BODY MUST READ THIS BOOK ONCE IN LIFETIME,"ONE SHOULD NOT GO AGAINST NATURE, THIS MAKES ONE COMFORTABLE IN LIF"
1,Worst Street Fighter,"At first,I thought this game would be great,but I was wrong.Thisgame is stupid!The characters move like puppets jerking around the arena.The game has non-fighting music unlike other games.No wonder it is no longer around!If you see that this game is the only fighter on the rental shelf,do not rent it unless you like being bored and sleeping in the middle of a game!RyanJanuary 26,2003"
4,Playing as a digitized Van-Damme,"digitized graphics? what the heck does that mean? kids today take for granted the photo realistic images on computers and games, but it was revolutionary back in the day and we called it ""digitized graphics"".Mortal Kombat was the first successful digitized game, and threw Street Fighter 2 off of the mountain (as king of fighting games). When the 32 bit playstation was launched, Capcom answered Midways Mortal Kombat with Street Fighter the Movie. The graphics were very good at the time and you could also play as Van-Damme (Guile in the Movie). Capcom also added super finishing moves to the game. The super finishers were not nearly as violent as mortal kombat, but they were a nice addition.This certainly isnt the best Street Fighter game, but the ability to play as a digitized Jean Claude Van Damme is pretty sweet!"
3,Arcade version and the console version: Huge difference!,"I just recently bought this game and was so excited to play it until i noticed that this game is different from the arcade version I remember playing.I agree with the other reviewers. They did not incorporate the fighting engine from the other street fighter games. The moves are choppy and kinda retarded looking. The Arcade version had the street fighter real moves, and the configuration was the same as the recent street fighter games. I mean, what gives man?I love the movie, but this game is kind of a disappointment to me.You make the decision, but I think the moves and combos on this game suck and they are too out dated as far as martial arts is concerned.Thanks for reading"
1,MISTAKE!!,"The hardcover version has -- it says -- 223 pages.The paperback version has -- it says -- 16 pages.Is that right? If that's the case, then each page weighs almost an ounce! Not likely, but....Somethings wrong here -- I was ready to buy the paperback, but not until this situation is cleared up."
2,not very good,i disagree with babyblues.this game is not very good.i had it and got rid of it.you quickly lose interest.and it isnt very challenging.it has very strange looking courts too and even stranger opponents.
3,Looks Good - NOT WATERPROOF,"As the other reviews say, this product does look good. However, it is not waterproof, so I recommend putting a plain plastic shower curtain behind it. It would be better described as a shower curtain cover."
3,worth hearing,"I hardly agree with David Hurwitz here. Given Crumb's supervision of this recording, I was disappointed by this performance of Ancient Voices and in particular by soprano Martin, whose stagey operatic tone isn't appropriate for this work. (Jan DeGaetani's classic recording on Nonesuch 979149-2 is far better - her voice has a shadowy, folkish coloration that fits this music, while the warmer recorded sound better captures the resonance of the whole work.) Also on this recording are two Crumb songs written when he was 17 - romantic-impressionistic in style, they only faintly foreshadow his mature work. The two other pieces on this disc - the solo piano Little Suite for Christmas and the mystifying Dream Sequence for chamber ensemble - receive fine performances, though they would benefit from better recorded sound."
4,"Seller great, recording pretty good","This is a piece I dearly love. As it was written for Jan DeGaetani, it is difficult to accept anyone else's performance style. Ms. Martin does a fairly good job, but just isn't my type of singer for this work."
3,Great low-budget movie!!!,This is a very good low-budget film. Its mostly comedy I think but for a horror movie it's good to me. But Unfortunately I'm unable to purchase a dvd yet. I hope it comes out very soon and I look forward in buying it on dvd.
3,DECENT,This is an entertaining super low budget movie that is well written and acted. Those looking for hardcore horror may be disappointed (although there are a few gory kill scenes) because the comedy is the dominant factor here but if you're in a lighthearted mood you might really enjoy it. The Metalface character isn't likely to start a franchise as he lacks any distinctive characteristics and isn't even featured very often in the movie. Still it's a good script and shows potential for the writer and actors. The directing is very pedestrian and several scenes suffer from bad camera angles but overall it's a fun movie and should satisfy the appetite of those who like a their horror with a heavy dose of comedy.
5,Very good range,"This antenna has some pretty good range, even surrounded by trees it still managed to get a few thousand feet, The one issue i had with this was that as a first time installation it was very difficult figuring out what cable to get as far as compatibility, trendnet has the worst support in the world, between trying to call and email they never got back, so great produt HORRIBLE support, after trying to figure out how to get this to work with a linksys router i ended up getting the cable and then buying the adapter so that i could get it installed, so if you dont have experience putting one of these together maybe difficult."
3,"Not exactly Wipeout, but not exactly terrible either.","The first thing you will notice in this game are the graphics. Not because they are good, but because they are some of the ugliest on the Sega Dreamcast. Not a promising start, but after the initial shock, if you can REALLY persevere and play MagForce Racing for a while, you will start to realise it is actually half decent.Although it starts off very slow, after you unlock a few things it really does speed up. There are also lots of excellent tracks to race on, some of them brilliantly designed. You do have to stick with the game for a while to unlock these, but they are worth the effort.If you can forgive the fact that it seems hideous at first with its poor graphics, fairly average sound and not great to begin with gameplay, you will find some enjoyment from Mag Force. If more time and effort had been spent on it, it could have been great and perhaps even comparable to the Wipeout series of games."
4,Magforce racing,"Magforce racing has a wide variety of ships(about 30)!In 5 classes,primetime,class1,class2,class3,and class4. if you like hardcore fast action racing,you'll love this!"
3,MagForce (Killer Loop?),"For those of you who liked Killer Loop for the Playstation, you should love this. That's because it IS Killer Loop under another title. Imagine a swift, smooth, floating pod-racer without the roar. Not much noise or action, but plenty of speed. A bit untraditional in gameplay. One can't simply gun-it to win. One must use the offensive and defensive power-ups to gain ground. This makes it a bit more challenging. Excellent lighting effects. Music is typical techno style."
3,Pretty Cool But Not What I Thought It Would Be,"I bought these ""paints"" for my 3 year old son for Christmas. While the concept is pretty cool-- (invisible paints that turn colors once applied to Color Wonder paper), I thought it was a little difficult to work with. For one, the color doesn't appear immediately. Kind of like a Poloroid, it takes a couple of minutes to actually develop. Which I don't have a problem with, but try explaining that to a little one. We waited and waited and waited and FINALLY got some results, but even then, it wasn't what was expected. Who knows? Maybe we just have to get used to working with them."
3,Color doesn't appear right away,"I bought this for my 2-year-old for Christmas because I love the idea, but unlike crayons, these markers take forever to show the color on the special paper. It's hard enough to keep a toddler's attention without having to explain that the colors are ""almost here"". Not what I expected."
1,Too messy and needs supervision for toddlers,"Hi, I don't have all three, but received the tablet with the 'finger paints' as a gift for my toddler. This is meant for an older child, but if you let a toddler play, you need to watch that he doesn't put his fingers near his eyes or in his mouth after handling the paint. Also it's messy. After the page is colored, you can still feel the paint on it --it feels as though there is some sort of lotion or gel on the pages. Yuck. It's fun to play with, but I didn't like the mess and threw it away when my little guy was napping!"
1,unusable,"It is difficult to quickly use since every 30 minutes I must be reset to be able to continue using it, and the battery unloading, in addition I must have loading all along it since if I disconnect it although it has new batteries and just loaded, remains out of line quickly"
3,wisdom from the past,"A must-read for those seeking wisdom in the everyday-ness of life. M. de Montaigne's words are both humorous and profound, crisply translated and arranged by M. Lowenthal that make of the book a pleasant read, not just to pass the time but to get something out of it. It honestly leads one to the desired effect, to take up and read M. de Montaigne's book Essays itself to continue drinking from his fount of wisdom."
1,Don't overpay!,"Don't get me wrong. I love ATHF. But you can buy all the individual sets much cheaper than in this collection,(at least at the time of this note) so why pay extra? It's not like you're getting more material, or even special packaging.Don't be seduced by price gouging!"
3,A fair port.,"The game moves quite well and the controls are alright. The main problem is the health meter. It drains REALLY FAST! Much faster than the Amiga version. It's wise to use a cheat code the first few times playing. The music is okay, nowhere near as awesome as the Amiga version. The major problem is that you can hardly hear it. It's all so quiet! There are a few more issues but if you are a hardcore Turrican fan or are desperate to play Turrican, I would say go ahead. It's not for the regular audience.6.5/10"
3,Nothing special.. except for this one song...,"Low-budget, fairly average DIY indie rock from the kind of band that's nice to have playing in a local scene, as long as nobody expects too much from them. ""Kidney"" is sort of sweet in a Miracle Legion B-side sort of way. ""Chandra Mukhi"" is another half-decent song in search of a good vocal. But there's this one song that makes this almost worthwhile: ""Satch Carlson"" is an absolute classic masterpiece of a song, a devastating, gorgeous in-joke for car-magazine obsessives. Definitely not a good album, but oh, that song."
5,more beautiful imagery from John Davis,John Davis returns with another 'cobweb' album. It's sheer fragility lingers after much of the album is finished. Putting aside his Folk Implosion side project (with Sebadoh's Lou Barlow) for just long enough to dazzle us all.
1,Look elsewhere for real information,"This book is not only sadly out of date, the author admits most scholars would consider it absolutely wrong and spends much time defending his own credentials. Indeed, his entire preface is a plea to take him seriously even though he's writing for the popular market because his contemporary scholars would reject his work.He gets a lot of stuff wrong. For example, he has a photo of Ahkenaten sitting on his throne with the hands of the solar disk Aten holding anks to him and this is labelled as being an image of the Aten. The figure is most certainly not the deity, but the pharaoh. He spends pages on animal worship and completely ignores the Apis bull. He makes connections where there are none (between Osiris's coffin being caught in a tree and a type of vegetation worship for which we have no evidence). If you want to know about Egyptian mythology, look elsewhere."
3,good review of the ballparks,good information about each ballpark but dated in the presentation even though it was just released in 2009 - it had to be filmed in the late 80s when Comiskey and Tiger Stadium were still open. Each segment is about 20 minutes and provides a decent summary and inoformation about each of the 4 parks.
3,"Nice, if you like fondant","These fun-shaped cakes do not require special pans, but some do require some sculpting skills. All are covered with rolled fondant, which most folks who grew up in the US with Mom's buttercream frosting tend to find too sweet and ""strange"" in texture. Nice book for what it is, but probably not highly useful to most US home bakers. I bake and decorate five or six cakes most weeks, but I wouldn't bake any from this book."
3,Great color photos; sugarpaste method,"This book has wonderful and creative ideas for cakes. It is applicable to both adults and children, but beware it uses the sugarpaste method. If you prefer the Wilton method of buttercream icing, find another book; this one is not easily converted."
3,quick and easy.....,This book had several pictures of the overall look but used equipment or unusual items to cut or decorate with. The general ideas are easy to copy if you have the eye for it.
3,Do you need the External Flash?,"Hello, I have used many different types of cameras through the years of my diving career and have found the cheaper cameras to be very limited in the ability to take good pictures.No matter what camera you choice, you MUST use an external flash. If you are a certified scuba diver you already know the reason for this. YOU should know, it's part of your training. This flash unit puts out just enough light for the intented purpose of the line of Reefmaster cameras. I would recommend renting a camera system before purchasing; make sure this camera system and flash unit meet your expectations."
2,Should call it Cricket Storm,"I bought this product on the reviews I read. As far as the thunderstorm on the CD it seems really good. The crickets, however, are NON-STOP. No kidding. I get that this is the ""deep woods"" thunderstorm, but really, did we have to forget to bring the deep-woods Off? Thats how many crickets and cricket noises you hear on this CD. I am so unhappy with this purchase. If you want thunderstorm noise, buy Electrifying Thunderstorms. All storm, no insect invasion."
4,Stand,This product arrived when expected. There is nothing spectacular about it other than a stand to place your keyboard on so it serves its purpose.
3,Works but flimsy,"The price seems a bit excessive given its somewhat lack of stability. It does the job, but don't expect very sturdy support."
4,Very Good Stand!,"Purchased this stand in conjunction with my acquisition of the Casio Privia 330 as I am learning piano. The stand is sturdy enough for home use although I can see if you really bang the keys hard on your keyboard it can cause the stand to wobble a bit. An earlier review said that this stand is not good for the Privia which I disagree with. The rubber ""grips"" on the stand are adjustable to the width of the keyboard resting on it. Initially, it appears that the stand is too wide and the Privia would be resting on the metal bars which would cause the keyboard to be unsecure and slide. All you have to do is twist & move the rubber ""grips"" in towards the center so that they rest underneath the Privia. Overall a very good stand."
4,Solid for the price,"Instead of the assembly screws coming in a small bag, they are hidden in the holes they screw into on the stand.Other than that, this stand is nice and sturdy, VERY strong, and a great value. Holds my huge Casio WK-3200 with ease.Looks nice too. Recommended."
4,I got what I paid for,"Although the box says this stand will bear 113 lbs, I wouldn't recommend it. Even at a lower height, my 40-lb keyboard rocks this stand front to back. That's moderately annoying when I'm playing, but a small child could tip this stand with a little ambition. Definitely not a long-term solution for houses with little ones. I plan to put it up when relatives come to visit.The stand is well-made and easy enough to assemble. If you need portability and have a lightweight keyboard, this is probably a good choice. But if you want a permanent home for your keyboard, invest in something sturdier."
3,cheap and kind of effective,"I bought this item for my cousin to use with a 61 key keyboard and it's pretty basic. Because of that, I spent a lot of time adjusting to sit level on the floor. I could see this as a big problem if you were using this for actual shows or had to move around a lot. Otherwise, if you're leaving it stationary, good price, sturdy, and easy to adjust."
2,"Wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble baby, wobble","I got this in hopes of saving a few bucks vs a double. I put my Mixer on it and went to spin and it wobbled pretty bad, made me feel uneasy. My mixer is a DDJ-S1 and weighs only 20 pounds but it doesn't hold it securely. i recommend a double-X stand which i have several of and they provide a sturdy platform!"
4,It works,I've owned a Casio keyboard for several years but often kept it in the box it came in since I did not have a stand for it. I chose this stand because while my keyboard is no longer an active product it appeared to me that this one might work.It is not a perfect match but after several attempts I have managed to get the keyboard pretty firmly placed on the stand. I play with the keyboard far more often than before and am glad I got this stand.
4,Works perfectly for my keyboard,"I like how easy this was to assemble... it took me only 5 minutes to put together and it fits my keyboard very well. You can adjust how tall or short you want the stand to be which is a nice feature. It also is very easy to move around.My only complaint is that I wish it had some sort of feature that held the keyboard in place. The keyboard just sits on top, so the keyboard can fall off if someone bumps into accidentally. Other than that, great product!"
2,a stand,Its a stand but not what my kid expected... its keeps the keyboard okkeep in mind its only for Small keyboards
4,Decent stand good price.,I use a Casio PX-130. The stand does not keep the piano completely immovable so it does rock a little when I play harder. It was was to install and I use it on a flat non-carpeted floor.
2,I recommend spending a bit more on a stand,"This thing is wobbly even on a completely level surface. This thing will get you by in a pinch, but if you have another $20 to spend, go for a double-X stand by a different brand."
2,Consider a return,"The x stand looks good but it is not designed for heavy piano, at least not my 88-keys px-130. The x stand shakes when I press any note. I am using carpet so I think the shake comes from the two main bars. I can't bear it. I will recommend if you are using a 61-notes or some lightweight pianos only."
3,It won't stay stable,"The stand is the kind of thing that is easy to use and cheap to buy. But one problem I am experiencing is that, screws might be loosen after a short period time of using, so it allows my keyboard to tilt back and forward. I have to push it up against a wall to play."
4,"Solid, but Unstable","Considering its price, this stand is absolutely great, esp when u compare it to the same single-X from casio or yamaha. The arms and supporters look thicker than what in the picture. The only drawback is its almost untolerable sway under some passionate performance. It may derive from the fact that the stand is a little bit smaller for a 88-key piano. But due to the lack of references, i cannot tell if a bigger stand or a double-X one would solve the problem."
3,Was a little twisted,"This stand has a good price and does what's suppose to do. One of the bars wasn't straight though, so we had to put a little peace of cardboard while screwing, so it would be firm and straight. Not perfect but OK."
1,It could be better!,"I use this item as a stand for Casio Digital Piano(130). Even though the price of this product is so good, it would be better if retailer checked one more thing. Actually, I assembled one bar with different direction. So I tried to change the direction. However, it was impossible because hexa-screw driver does not work. The bolt's head was easily crushed by the screw driver itself. I decided to use it instead of returning the item. Anyway, this item is good for beginners."
1,Not even able to mount it ......,"Item came with no hardware to mount it. Base foot was missing hole to mount it anyway. Terrible quality control!. I suspect this was already a returned box, as the item box was already opened when I received it. Bottom line: useless! I would not even give one star, yet I cannot comment without giving at least one star..."
3,OK,I need to know what the screws are called. I looked everywhere for them and mine did not bring any. Even inside the pieces; not there. Overall not satisfied. I need to order the screws in order to use my stand.
2,Did not fit my Yamaha YPT220 Keyboard,Bought this for the yamaha ypt220 keyboard. But none of the slot options in the X crossbar fit my keyboard. The grooves in the keyboard for snapping the stand are either short or long of the settings provided.
1,"DEFECTIVE AS RECEIVED, GREAT SERVICE FROM SELLER","The design of this stand appears good, but mine arrived in a condition where it could not be assembled. One hex bolt was turned in so tight it could not be removed for assembly without stripping the inside of the hex head. I contacted the manufacturer for the replacement of the defective leg. They wanted a picture of the entire stand, the defective leg, and the barcode. All this for a leg that was probably only worth a few dollars plus shipping.I finally decided to just request a credit from The Musician's Friend, the Amazon supplier. Their customer service was excellent and resulted in a full refund.I was not pleased with the support of the manufacturer, but was very pleased with The Musician's Friend and would order from them again."
2,Sloppy design,"I can't be too harsh, because the darn thing only cost $20, but the poles that the keyboard sits on are not even level with each other. The keyboard will rest on three of the pads. Given the design you can't really rotate those poles. You can slide the pads out but if the keyboard plastic sits on metal it will just slide all over the place. I just had to put a spacer under the fourth corner."
5,Low profile and assembly is easy,I needed this stand to fit with a keyboard on top of it and to keep it under a desk until needed. It could go low enough to do it just fine. The matte black finish is nice too. Took me a minute to figure out that the screws to hold the cross bars were already screwed in and needed to be removed and reapplied. It's cool.
3,Decent,"It's okay and holds my keyboard securely.I was hoping it would be a little shorter, so that I could sit in a chair and play. This stand is meant for standing up to play (IE: On Stage), so I just use a tall stool we had around the house."
5,Great for research,"I found this as a good reference book, especially for indepth understanding to specific passages in the bible. It was very helpful on many college term papers and tests. I would always be sure to consult this book for any questions that I had."
1,Oh come on. . .,"A horrible game, with grain graphics (even for its time) and a stupid concept - fighting a censoring government with Aerosmith CDs??? Right. I could make a better game with what my cat coughed up last night."
5,So Hot shawty,This music is one of the most brilliant jazz music I have ever heard. I'm not really into jazz but I like his work.
1,No Waterproof !!!!!!,please ignore this review.I was wrong about the type of camera.....(the type that I've tried was Sharkdiver sl301)sorry.
2,This game is not worth 30 bucks!!,I owned it and played it in the early 90's and it sucks!! It's boring and does not use real players. At the most it should cost only 5 bucks brand new and not 29.00. Trust me don't waist your money on a POOR Genesis baseball game like this. Go for Sports Talk Baseball or the R.B.I. series.
4,Beautiful product,"When I recieved this item I was impressed by its appearance and weight. This is no cheap light-weight bangle. It's brilliantly shiny, polished and beautiful. It came with a gift box -which is a huge bonus. I plan to give it to my aunt for Christmas this weekend - she collects silver bangles. Great gift for a decent price."
5,Helps clarify your vision,This is a great book for a great price - seriously the author could charge more! There are very few books that I consider to be truly helpful to the aspiring writer - this is one of them.
2,"Some good, some not so good","Overall, the book provides some useful tips for time management for the professional writer. However, I found the reading of it fairly dry and not terribly inspiring, and I am not so sure many of the time management techniques given are applicable only to writers, many are found elsewhere, and others are just plain common sense."
5,More than the title,having never been a advocate for motivational books I've changed my ways. Writing has been a twinkle in the back of my subconscious mind for eons. Time finally arrived with retirement and writing has come forward into my life. This book not only inspires but instructs at a adult level. It is more than time management and with its bibliography to aim you at the next books to read it pays for itself. As a novice in the world of creative writing I would recommend this book to all.
2,Not sure how to use it,"I read this book and found it inspiring if unusual. His theory of the craft of writing is unique. However, after reading it I was left puzzled: how to use his technique when I've got loads of unfinished novels, unfinished stories, unfinished essays? His carefully described technique assumes one is starting from scratch, but I'm not doing that. So I don't know how to adapt his technique to my own writing. I wish he had included a section on how to adapt his technique to works-in-progress."
5,a very touching story about traumatic brain injury,"As a mother of a 14yr old son who suffered a TBI on may 27,1998, I could totally relate to this mother's agagonizing journey to help her child find the way back. No one can ever understand the experience of traumatic brain injury until they go through it...I wish it on no one."
1,I agree with not realistic,"My 10 year ols son went through a severe brain injury also 3 years ago. Most do not go off to college etc... I have been going through this too living at arehab hospital. Misty was very lucky. Most have a severe memory problem or speech problems. Quite a few never walk again. They experience severe spasicty that never allows fine motor skills. If you take this book with a grain of salt and realize this is one success story and remember there are alot more stories that will never end like this then it is a""bearable"" book. Please if your loved one suffers from this injury, be REALISTIC. This is a ""happy ending"" book. Most real stories are not. I noticed family responded to the negative review. While I do feel for you, I do not feel it's fair to the public to have unrealistic views of a brain injury. Many of these people's children will not walk, talk,or even come out of a coma. Misty's recovery even through years of grief, was a miracle. Not everyone is granted that!!"
4,UNDERRATED GEM,"BALAAM AND THE ANGEL, FOR SOME REASON, WAS ALWAYS OVERLOOKED IN THEIR FANTASTIC CAREER OF MAKING CULT-LIKE GOTH ROCK. ALTHOUGH MANY PEOPLE KNOW THEM FOR THEIR 1988 CULT HIT 'I LOVE THE THINGS YOU DO TO ME' THEY ALSO RELEASED OTHER ALBUMS SUCH AS THIS ONE. THE SLEEVE NOTES ARE WRITTEN BY THE SINGER/BASSIST OF THE BAND, AND THE SONGS ARE JUST GREAT. I WISH PEOPLE WOULD WAKE UP AND REALIZE THAT THIS IS THE BAND FOR EVERONE."
4,"To the person that wrote...""Kurdish Cookbook",I Believe that this book was fantastic although I am familiar with many of the recipies I would like to say your behavior was inappropriate and should be corrected.
2,I wouldn't buy it.,"I bought this bag in 2007, and it lasted me mere months. I'm leaving this review in January of 2012, not 2007(like it says?). After a short time my fists were punching holes in it, and it eventually ripped in half. Unless the material has changed, it won't hold up to the abuse it logically should be able to withstand. To be fair, I throw hard punches, and no bag lasts me too long. On the bright side, I contacted TKO, and they picked up my bag, and sent me a new, better one at no cost. TKO stands behind their products."
2,Not worth reading,"The plot had great potential, but the anachronistic and flippant speaking style and attitudes of the characters marred what might have been a good read. I love books with humor and wit, but a historical novel shouldn't go so very far away from the period."

3,Windows XP Users Beware!,"I picked up a copy of Arcanum back when I was still using Windows ME for my system (hey, somebody had to buy it!). I played it seemingly nonstop for a few weeks. The game is great, from the storyline to the graphics and gameplay. Then disaster hit. I thought I'd upgrade my computer to XP. Let's just say that Arcanum will not seamlessly transfer over to the new operating system. I contacted Sierra support and was told (many days later), ""Arcanum was not designed for Windows XP and at this time there are not immediate plans to release a patch."" Translation: we feel you pain, but we could care less. Kind of a strange point of view about an operating system that more and more people are upgrading to. So, in short, loved the game until the upgrade."
4,Arcanum,"Great rpg. Has one of the best skill system evere, where you choose between magic and thecknology. It look a bit out dated graphical, but if your a fan of turned based rpgs this is a sure wonner."
5,What an adventure!!,"It has been YEARS since I had played a game so immersive. It is clear that a lot of thought and detail went into this game. I have been playing for 10 days and based on what I've heard, have barely scratched the surface of this game. By the way, it's true that the graphics are not great - if I want graphics I'll play Max Payne - the graphics are more than sufficient."
2,Buggy in the Extreme,"This game seems to me as if it'd be a good game, however, it's buggy in the extreme in multiplayer.The solo play adventure is pretty good about stability, but the multiplayer is NOT up to Sierra's usual standards of excelence.First off, the main multiplayer chat interface itself is buggy, often returning games that have nothing but 0's for stats, like ping, players, up time, et cetera.The chat menu's lobby list tends to pop up over other nessessary things at times.It crashed a few times while trying to make a new character.And consistantly crashes whenever I try to log onto a multiplayer game, sometimes after just giving me a split-second game view, sometimes not even letting me get that far."
2,Successor to Fallout series ! unfortunately not a worthy one,"(If arcanum is anything like Fallout and Fallout 2 then it will be worth your time and money.) this was my initial review. After having played the demo, the game, and read many reviews I have downgraded the arcanum game to 2 stars. The reasons are as follows:-Arcanum fails to live up to the world of fantasy that it resides in. The concept was wonderful but it was not develloped to its potential.-There are many small bugs in the game-Monster generation is poorly handled. Wolves and spiders make up alomst 50% of all monsters encountered. The combat mode does not allow for the amount of sophisticated strategies that we are used to.If you are looking for an RPG then turn towards the Baldur's gate series, particularly BG II and the BG II expansion. they will give you a much better experience."
3,"Playable, but lacking so very much","Arcanum was a good time burner, but It wasn't a game that I got into very much. Graphically I felt like this was on par for maybe 3 or 4 years ago, but for 2000 standards it was lacking, except for a few of the spells wich looked pretty hype. Gameplay was what I felt too similar to Diablo II, a lot of point click hack and slash. The plot was decent, but I didn't like the whole ""you are the one"" type story line, it's been played out waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much. The interface could be tricky at times, but it wasn't too difficult to figure out. I like the character development, it was very good as far as that goes, but thought they could have used a few character classes as well. All in all, if you want to waste some time before Neverwinter Nights comes out and you have played every other Top of the Chart RPG then pick up Arcanum, I wouldn't say it's a waste of money."
3,Fallout Remake,"If your a huge fallout fan you will like this game. I gave it a three because it does have a solid RPG element. However, with that said...graphics arent even as good as fallout tactics and with the game coming out after that title and not even matching its standard i find it dissappointing...BG/IWD series shames it in the graphic department. Nothing new really in the game...just fallout with a orc and elf theme. Guns versus magic is a decent touch however. This game will have a decent following as the hordes that loved fallout will need a fix...but they could have done the game better i believe...now this review is just based off the demo...but, I guess i will wait for NWN or Pool of Radiance for my next RPG game...again, if your a big fallout fan i think your right at home with this game"
5,The COOLEST PC RPG I Have EVER Played!,"Arcanum is a great mix of the worlds of fantasy and middle-ages, and of magic and technology. The story is very interesting and kept me playing straight through. The vast customization of you character is pretty impressive. Since I don't normally play PC RPGs (or any PC games period), I highly suggest ARCANUM for everyone and anyone who likes video games."
4,Greatest RPG I've played,"The variables in the game play make this such a unique game, each time you create a new character the posibilities are endless and throughout the game play (in turn based or real time) the results of your actions are never the same. If you create the exact same character and try to play the game through the same way the game is always different"
4,Arcanum,I really liked the aspect that you could use your own mp3 files as background music in the game. It has more of a fantasy feel to it rather than Fallout. Great game overall.
1,Gosh! Could this game BE more confusing??,"I paid way too much for this game when it first came out. I should have opted for Anarchy Online at Fry's where I instead purchased the tedious Arcanum. Steamworks really appeal to me, as does fantasy roleplaying and gaming in general but this game was a true disappointment. I created several characters and generally anything aside from a warrior is going to get trounced right off the bat. Perhaps I'm just not that skilled with magick-users and such but sheesh! I really hoped for a good experience with this game but even in (especially in) multi-player it's time-consuming and bug-ridden. Oh, well - live and learn! It might be worth its current price but don't expect to much from it and be prepared to endure alot of headache searching for items to survive with. Overall, unfortunately, its a waste of your cash."
1,Awful,"This game is the worst I've seen in years.It makes Fallout 1 look like advanced technology.The graphics and sound literally look like something out of 1992...The idea that anyone would release such a piece of unmitigated [junk], in the age of Diablo and Neverwinter Nights, boggles my mind, and I urge you, nay, I ABJURE you, not to waste your money on this."
1,Frustrated Former Customer,"Well it looks like Sierra has decided to take it's time in makeing this game. In the meantime I'm afraid there going lose their customer base if they keep pushing foward the deadline.If memory serves me correct, Sierra was going to publish this game last year (I think around September). Then they decide to release it this May. Now it's once again been pushed back to September.I was very interested in this game when I first heard about it last year. But now I'm just fed up with Sierra. In fact I'll be suprized if I buy the game when (and if) they publish it.I honestly think that anyone out there who was interested in this game ought to just not buy it. ... the game. Maybe then Sierra will respect their customers and their deadlines.It is out of fustration that I give this game, which still hasn't been published, a 1 star."
1,we already have baldur's gate & every thing else it spawned,Sierra just needs to go make space quest 7.
5,So cool!!!!!!!,"After playing this game i came to one conclusion,This is the best role playing game ever.I had played ""Diablo II"" and ""Dungeon Siege"" but I must say that this game is much more entertaining. It is alotlopnger than any other role playing game and has the element of having to think.I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoyed ""diablo"" and Dungeon Siege"""
1,This is not Big Box Version,"Attention! This is the slim case version, not the big box version shown in the picture. You will received only slim case with cd"
4,"A good time, worth the effort","I have been playing Arcanum for a week or so. Its a lot of fun, and there is so much to do. I love being able to make a character with a real person's set of skills and ""interests"". Its a huge open-ended and enjoyable world. The sheer variety of quests and twists and turns is fabulous. I love it.The downsides are some issues with it slowing down, and some places where you just cannot see what is happening. The graphics are somewhat dated, but I don't really worry about those, and the voice acting is great.This a huge step up from games like Diablo where you hack monsters and open chests for hours. There is real thinking and problem solving. A great RPG, for all its lack of polish."
2,Plenty of better CRPGs,"Lots of neat quests to keep you going, and the landscapes and cut scenes are really graphically impressive. However, character graphics/animation is sloppy. Only text based conversation with most NPCs--those that are not considered main characters to the story. Inventory management is difficult without more ""stackable"" items, and no ""quick transport"" from site to site without forking over 75 gold pieces a head or more to ride the train or sail in a ship. Overall, I'd rather play Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate."
4,A mix of DII and D&D,"Although deffinately hopping on the bandwagon and trying to emulate games like Baulder's Gate and Icewind Dale (Who wouldn't want a game that popular?), Arcanum is very similar to the long drawn out, and what I sometimes find very boring world of RPG games like the two aforementioned. I tend to prefer the hack and slah without much thinking about it Diablo 2 style of play.In other words, I'm that friend who tried to kill all of the townspeople when you tried a multiplayer game of Icewind Dale.But Arcanum is somewhat different. I haven't figured it out yet, but for some reason, I happen to like this game, rather than spend $... on it, get frustrated 10 minutes into the game, and end up giving it to my friend's girlfriend like I did Icewind Dale.I think it was how the chickens fought back when you attacked them... yeah, that was hours of amusment for me."
5,Great game. NOT THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING!!!,"Eventhough this game is one of my all time, favorite games. The picture that they use(d if changed) to show the game is honestly False. And I Bought the game thinking that I would get the jewelcase and everything that came with the game, when it was new (the picture thet makes it look like the game come in a box). But that was not the case (think the normal plastic game case that's used when they try to get out the last cents out of the game).So as i said, this is a great game that deserved a purchase when Troika existed and it still deserves a buy now. I just hope, that the original creators atleast get royalties, for mine and yours purchase.I let others tell a more indepth and (more grammaticaly correct) objective review."
4,"Great game, but beware...","The system requirements listed here at Amazon.com are incorrect - they do not match the requirements given by the game developers. They should read as follows:64 MB RAMPentium II-300mHzDirectX compatible 8MB video card4X CD-ROMWindows 95/98/ME/20001.2GB disk spaceWindows compatible sound cardNow, IF you have all that, I'm sure it's a fantastic game! Sadly, I only have a 5.5MB video card so I get real choppy and ... performance even in decreased-graphics mode. Believe it or not, I still struggle through playing because it's a fantastic game, plot-driven yet still open-ended, and I do enjoy myself. I'll simply have to get a new computer in order to enjoy it more fully."
2,"It was released too early, like so many games","It may not happen to others, but I get a total screen freezeabout every 10 minutes. I have a high-end game machine. I have the patch in, it doesn't help.My other games don't have this problem. Sierra's tech support (the maker of Arcanum) are not helpful. If you like a pretty good RPG - it could have been a great one - buy it. Otherwise, keep your money."
1,<sigh>..........Another Sierra flop.,"Stuttering graphics, severe slowing during actions, cheesy graphics you'd expect from about 5 or 6 years ago......[PRICE]Not only that, multiplayer is practically nonexistant, the patches are extremely unreliable, game freezes AFTER the patches............Take my advice.........stay away from this and all other Sierra Products. Keep in mind, this is the same company that came out with the little gem Rage of Mages............."
3,"So close to good, but a little dated.","I can't say I didn't like this game. It's got an interesting premise, a decent story, and some entertaining moments, but I couldn't help asking myself if this was the best they could do with it. So much of this game reminds me of 1996; the graphics, the repetitive music (ONE SONG?!), some of the gameplay. . . it's just old. Nothing's wrong with old games. Ultima 1 was a good game, but that doesn't mean I'd pay forty bucks for it. Fallout was also a good game, but I can get it and it's sequel for ten dollars now. Here, I'm playing the same game on a different world for 4 times that much money.Personally, I think this is a good start to a franchise. I'd buy a sequel, assuming they update it. Better graphics, more music, more skills, a better combat system, and deeper characters would have made this game of the decade."
2,Disappointing.,"Bought this game hearing that it was in the style of the old Fallout titles, a kind of spiritual successor to Planescape Torment. Unfortunately, it falls short of expectations. Outside of the numerous bugs, there are issues with movement which make the game tedious, quest problems that make the main story difficult to navigate, and the game is so unbalanced that the purported ""Use magic or technology"" system may as well be ""use magic or die."" Would not buy again."
3,Prairie Songs should be for children 12 and older.,"Prairie Songs should be listed for children high school age, not for ages 9 to 12. It's very depressing for younger children. I read this book with my 13 year old and was crying while I read parts of it. The book is a very good account of the many hardships and tragedies suffered by pioneers going west, but I seriously don't recommend it for children younger then 13 or 14. When I bought this book, with a name like ""Prairie Songs"", I expected something more on the order of a ""Little House"" book. There was to much death and sadness in the book."
4,A Poignant Tale about Life on a Prairie Homestead,"I really enjoyed this story about Louisa and her family, who lived in a soddy on the open prairie. It is a poignant tale and I like Conrad's voice and style of writing - very down-to-earth with beautiful descriptions. I could easily visualize the scenery and the characters. It is a bit mature for young readers, however. It's not so much that the topics are too mature (insanity, stillbirth, isolation); it's that the resolution is not exactly uplifting, and harsh reality may be too much for children under 12 or 13 years of age. If you've read Where the Red Fern Grows, it is a sad story in the same way. Be aware of this if you are buying it for a young reader."
3,"A harsh, but mostly realistic look at prairie life","As a teacher I had wanted to use this book as part of my social studies curriculum. I enjoyed the story and felt Louisa's longing for the books Mrs. Berryman owns. While there were some disturbing scenes (violence by a child against his mother that is never resolved) and some prejudice against Native Americans (it does a good job presenting the settler's point of view, but instead of painting the Native Americans as thieves it could have a less stereotypical view) I think it tells an important tale. However, there are other texts that tell this story in a way more appropriate for a school setting. I would definitely let my own children read it however, as long as we talked about the troublig issues in it."
3,Meh,"A little flimsier than I expected. The smaller spoons felt great, but the larger items felt cheap. Also, the 2 cup piece doesn't have any grooves or any other physical indication that you are set on the measurement you are looking for, so it's inexact."
5,Good Product. Will Recommend.,"This set is nice it was a little more then what I wanted but, the price was right. There made of a good heavy metal that I am sure will last for a while. They are stylish which wasn't what I wanted per say but, they fit will in my tool drawer. The Adjust-A-Cup is nice as well, especially for foods like peanut butter."
1,Measuring cup does not hold liquids,The seal on the measuring cup was not tight enough to hold liquids and leaked out the bottom on first use. Neat idea but not very piratical. Thank goodness for Amazon's easy return policy.
3,measuring spoons,"I bought these because Alton Brown uses them all of the time. The measuring cup is great for things like shortening, butter, peanut butter, etc. that is thick and hard to measure. The measuring spoons are a pain and regular old spoons work better."
4,A lot of measuring in a tiny amount of room,"I found all of these items very useful, but some of them were difficult to clean. If you are a baker, you will love them!"
4,Notebook with unique tilework photo art and magnetic cover- approx. 100 lined pages,"Ispahan (Paperblanks: Islamic Tileworks)[Hardcover]The cover of this little notebook is a photo taken by the French photographer Gérard de George of tilework from the capital city of the Isfahan Province in Iran called ""Isfahan"" (translated as ""Ispahan"" in English). This is one in a series. Each has the same unique cover photograph art and magnet in the little fold-over cover. The other's use photos of tilework from the cities of Casablanca, Yazd and Kaspa.They are found used, here, for under $50 (over $100 new!). My wife found this one, new, for less than $10 elsewhere (like a TJ Maxx). [4 stars for size and price]"
5,Love these!!,"Excellent for tube feeding baby birds,cats,dogs just anything..you can cut to the size needed!! will be buying more!!"
5,book review,my 16 yr old history buff loves this book. Actually took the time to tell me how much he liked it - that right there says something!
2,bad quality,First time playing it already had problem. It stopped after 3 seconds. After 3-5 time playing. This DVD cannot be played anymore.The story is ok thought.
1,Estate Planning in Florida,"This book,excepting 2-3 paragraphs of little value, could be entitled Estate Planning in...West Virginia, South Dakota or any other state. Florida has some unique procedures and ramifications for domiciling which are basic to financial and estate planning, which are conspicuous in this book because of their absence. I had not intended to purchase a generic primer covering various forms and documents known to all mankind. Perhaps my expectations were falsely elevated by those recommending it."
3,great beach reading,"I am a huge fan of Choose Your Own Adventure Books. I spent many summer vacations time traveling, meeting Mayans and what not. Recently I discovered an ""adult"" version of this genre. And, adult is the right word for this particular volume. (This book is not for kiddies, faint of heart, or anyone who thinks Sex in the City was riske.) All in all, a fun read. But, I am glad I did not pay full price for it."
4,Annoyingly Good,"I saw this book and wanted to hate it. Being a choose your own adventure freak, it scared me...But I read it anyway and it's freakin' funny. Definately recommend it."
1,do you want to hire the best?,"Amusingly, Hunter states how certain questions should not be asked of job candidates in the US, due to non-discrimination laws. But he then immediately proceeds to broadly hint (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) how the interviewer should indirectly ferret out such data, if you deem it germane.He then goes on to suggest that interviewees should adopt the dress of the executive and banking industries. Wretched idea. A spineless conformism. Do you want to have the chance to hire the best people or not? His advice can cause you to lose some creative and brilliant programmers who care little about a dress code or those employers who set store by it.Sure, some top notch people will readily conform. But others won't. And the truly talented do not have to work for you. You are competing for them, more than the reverse. For a purely, self interested viewpoint, you should not impose a dress code. Maximises your chances of getting the best."
4,Maybe too realistic,"Many of the negative reviews seem to concentrate on what they feel is a plot that is not realistic. I, however, found the plot to be exceedingly realistic. We are living most of what this author wrote about today. We, the people, have given up our rights a little at a time until proactically nothing that our fore fathers fought and died for still exists. I applaud this author for his courageous work."
4,Too close to the truth!,"Great Novel for first time Novelist Matthew Bracken. I would have found it more entertaining if not for the fact that, though ""Enemies Foreign and Domestic"" is a work of fiction, I can't help the feeling that I'm reviewing future history, and this work is an omen of wicked events to come. For all it's worth people in Bracken's Novel are completely convinicing (Both the ""Good Guys"" and the ""Bad Guys"") and have the same strengths and weaknessess that everybody has. Regardless of how some feel about these issues, Bracken makes his point that everybody had better be prepared or suffer the fate of countless victims throughout history."
5,A MUST READ!,"This novel depicts the story of how the government could strip us of our second amendment rights. Not only is it a good fiction novel, it is also a plausible tale that every American who values freedom should take to heart. Matt is a friend of mine and I am looking forward to the sequel to Enemies. I am also grateful to him for writing not only an entertaining fictional story but a believable one as well. Good job Matt."
5,Dead on!,Unfortunately Enemies Foreign and Domestic is a Nostradamus like view into a possible near future scenario. Written by a true Operator.
4,Very Good,"This is a great book. The first of three, so good that I wanted to read the rest. However the next two books I had to question if they were the same story as they were so far off from the first and no where as good. Read this as a stand alone only and you will be happy. The next two ruined the story."
3,"Good, not great...","This was a good book but it was by no means a life changing novel. It never felt to me like I was introduced to normal people who rose up to face extraordinary situations. From the outset everyone introduced was either a hero or a villain and the character set got crowed with egos very quickly.I would suggest that anyone who was disappointed by this book to pick up ""Unintended Consequences"" by John Ross. It should appeal to the same audience. However, I believe it's a superior piece of literature with a more solid character and plot development."
5,Tasty start.,"I had written a long winding story of my own that ultimately led to nowhere that started in a similar fashion to this novel. Except the massacre occurs at a protest instead of a stadium and the assassin is never seen again. I freely admit that this is far better than what I came up with, although I do disagree with a couple plot points, mainly the stuff about Muslims being evil incarnate. But I would highly recommend this book to anyone who can handle the rather, ahem, adult subject matter."
3,Great read!,I really like this type of genre. The whole collapse of the government and the government agencies going rouge.( ATF?) Anways this first one is more relistic and I can see this happening if not already happening. The reason I am giving it three stars though is that the author REPEATEDLY (SPOILER ALERT!) states how one of the characters loves his sailboat and sailing on the water to get away from everything. I mean this is a constant theme and it gets really annoying. OK I GET IT! you like to sail. If anything I would just have borrowed the book instead of paying for it but its ok. I really enjoyed this book and the other books in this trilogy.
5,A Must Read,"Once you read this book, you just have to buy the next two in the trilogy. Matt has done a fine job and his writing gets better and better as you progress through the trilogy. A scary, possibly prophetic look at where this country could be heading. I have corresponded with Matt via email and he is polite and always answers his emails in a timely manner. If you go to his website, you can order the books directly from him and he will sign them as well. So happy he decided to move to the Kindle format."
5,A Terrifying Look at a Very Possible Future,"This is a story written about very believable characters set in common surroundings. There are no Swartzeneggers or Stallones. Just ordinary people reacting to a government gone out of control taking liberties away on a daily basis. There are no rifles taking out tanks at seven miles or machine guns that shoot millions of rounds per minute out of bottomless magazines.If you pay attention to your surroundings you can envision this story coming to life in your own hometown.This is a must read for people who are ambivalent about their 2nd Amendment rights and don't really ""care"" about guns. I could not put the book down and would favorably compare it to a Clancy."
1,Absolutely hilarious book,"This book is unintentional comedy. Unless you are part of an evangelical family that has the TV glued to FOX News 24/7, you will recognize this book as the crazy fantasy of the lunatic fringe of the far right wing.Imagine if Glenn Beck wrote a fictional book, this would be it."
1,kindle format drm worthless,downloaded book and was forced to read on computer because its drm protected and uses kindles special little format im all for stoping pirateing but come on i cant read it on my nook and no refund option weakbought the book from the authors site much better deal and its and amazing book other than haveing to wasted ten bucks on amazons scam .
5,A page turning joy to read.,"In probably 20 pages Mr. Bracken had me hooked on the characters, and the bleak future of American that he shows in his books. I consumed all three books in a week, forsaking my usual video games and computer for my Kindle and a recliner. I suggest anyone who is at all interested in end of the world/end of America books to read these. You won't be disappointed."
1,Troofer grist carried by Clancyesque technobabble,"As an anarchist, I have less use for government on principled grounds than even the most rabid of conspiracy cranks (who, if of a conservative bent, tend to erroneously view the Constitution as some sort of safeguard upon their liberties rather than the primary destroyer of them). In other words, I am generally predisposed to like this sort of fiction........but I had to put this down after a couple chapters. Reason? The caliber of writing is just, well, bad."
1,Good sleeping pill,I always try to finish every book I read but I just couldn't finish this one.2 major problems I found with it:1) Childish plots and language are present throughout the novel (yet at the same time the author over-sexualizes the main character)2) The author puts virtually no motive at all behind the ATF's plot to put more screws on the 2nd amendmentBottom line is that this book would only appeal to some ignorant 2nd amendment freaks who are paranoid about the government plotting something against them.Please read the sequel to this- Domestic Enemies: the Reconquista. Much better
1,"Thought I was buying a thriller, not an attempt to brainwash me against government and gun control","I really don't understand all the praise for this book. I found its message simplistic and grossly political: gun owners=good, government and gun control = bad. I couldn't believe that the author repeatedly used the phrase ""leftist, liberal media"". Is this a novel or a piece of political propaganda? I do not recommend this at all, unless you're in the mood for several hundred pages of anti government, anti gun control brain washing."
1,"if you're not a right winger, this book is awful","i feel like i've been trying to read this book for years, but it's only been a day and it says i'm only 12% done, egads, i can't go on. the racial slur when the main character slams arabs, then realizing the girl he's with is an arab changes it to muslims....and she concurs! please....i'm stopping this now before i have to go out and buy an uzi"
4,Is it fiction?,"WARNING!! The nightly news is a spoiler alert!!!Written years before the December 2012 tragedy that facilitated New York's evisceration of legal gun owners second amendment rights, Matthew Bracken has created a summary to what could easily be America's possible future.Encased in lucid story line with well developed characters, the popularity of this story is bound to grow without restraint. The author's knowledge of weapons and military tactics is translated into a believable and well thought out story.This is a very enjoyable read!!"
4,Exciting Book,"Although I thought the book started just a little slow, it really heated up and soon had me hooked. This was a very entertaining work of fiction."
5,review of Bracken's 'Enemies' trilogy,"I have read the entire trilogy.I find the characters to be engaging and realistic, well developed, and I find that the plot line and the described circumstances are all too plausible.I find all three of the trilogy to be most engaging, most knowledgeable regarding the actual world and the people in it, and a ray of hope in an ever deteriorating world.I find the trilogy to be the best new read I've had in many a year, and I was literally engrossed from the first words. I intend to continue purchasing and reading as the author releases more books.Mike Kemp"
2,really dragged out,I think the book could have been made much shorter.I already purchased the second of the three and wish I had waited till I was finished with the first before purchasing the second otherwise I would not had done so.They are a bit expensive for me also.I am a reader of non-fiction and will stick with them from here on.Just my opinion!
2,Couldn't get into it,"I tried, but couldn't read more than a few chapters. The plot just didn't seem very realistic and the characters were rather bland."
3,Not for me,"This book was not for me. I read the first three chapter and decided I did not need to waste my time on it. Since it is a trilogy, I won't be reading the rest."
2,good and evil act the same?,"This is a book about the creation, by renegade government employees, of a unit of secret police in the US. Unfortunately, while the secret police manufacture evidence, and kill people without trial, the forces of good turn around and do the same damned thing. I admit it might seem incredible, but I think the best way to take down renegade units of the government would be to do it with loyal units. If anyone just covers it up, by whatever means, justice is not served properly.The first 50 pages of the book don't draw you in very well, and the last 50 are very disappointing; the pretexts are moderately unbelievable, and we are being set up the whole book to care for a character, who never does seem to have a good plan, only to see him die toward the end."
1,Faulty,We got this rocker ad shortly thereafter the music stopped working. Even after adding batteries it did not play again. There have been too many times where the rocker goes over backwards as the child is rocking on it and sends child and rocker over. It is a danger to children. Have made several attempts to contact company with no response.
2,Disappointing,"We received this as a gift when our daughter was born. It is adorable - it looks very cute in her room. As she's gotten older we've put her on it at different stages, thinking maybe she'd start to take to it. As another reviewer mentioned as well, our daughter doesn't play much with it or show very much interest, though. To get it to play the music the button in one of the antennae has to be squeezed just right (fine for an adult, not so easy for a child) and it really doesn't rock well at all."
2,Dangerous,"Rockabye Betty Butterfly Rocker (and I'm sure all of the others rockers) is a VERY DANGEROUS product! Our daughter and her friends, on numerous occasions, have tipped over backwards sending their little fragile heads crashing into the ground. Their products should be recalled due to the poor rocker design. There are also small screw covers that can easily be removed posing a chocking hazard for the recommended age group of 0 months and up. I'm not sure why in the world this is recommended for 0 months and up anyway! If you own this, please report it to [...]"
1,Not original,"Got it on time, but the perfume smells aweful and nothing like the original. I complained but someone emailed back saying it is absolutely 100% original. Well, then something happened because it smells nothing like the original I have."
1,Looks good - thinner than a sheet.,Would not recommend. Very thin and I tossed it. My dogs wanted a bed to sleep in - not a sheet.
4,"Iogear 4 PORT USB 2.0 HIGH-SPEED Hub, nice product","Needing to expand the number of USB ports I have available, I decided to purchase an Iogear 4 PORT USB 2.0 HIGH-SPEED Hub. The product easily plugged into my system, which is running Windows XP with no issues and has worked fine since it was installed. The only down side I see with this product is that it was designed perhaps a little too small and lite. Being so small and lite, the USB wires can easily move the product around should the wires get tugged or moved. Should have been designed to be a little heavier and a bit bigger would be nice too. This is why I rated the product 4 stars instead of 5 stars. Other than that, works fine and is a good product."
2,Not good...,"2 days after I start using it the lights konk off. A week later, the mouse conencted to one of the ports stop working...Won't be buying again from iogear."
5,Nice small hub,"Lights for both in port and the out ports, uses a standard sized input usb cable, out ports clearly marked and lined up with status lights. Optional power supply is handy if you plug any big power users in otherwise does fine unpowered.Couldn't be easier to use, plug in the cables, watch for the lights to come on and stick it out of the way.The construction quality is very good, sturdy case and everything lines up nicely. I've had a couple in use for over a year now with no issues and just ordered two more."
4,Told from the perspective of the Christmas ornaments,"The Attic Christmas is a wonderful story to share with the family this Christmas. Told from the perspective of the Christmas ornaments, this story illustrates some the values that surround Christmas and highlights the importance of family and memories even after some family members have moved on. This is a great book to read aloud for those dealing with the loss of a family member."
3,Good backgroun info. but same old diet advice,"This is a good book with a lot of useful information, but in the end, all it provides is the same old food exchange diet(with slight variations for lower glycemic foods).Dr. Aronne also seems to contradict his own advice. He says in the book that weight loss must be slow to be permanent. He even tells you not to try and lose any more than 10% of your bodyweight at one time, but the diet section only provides guidance for three different calorie levels: 1200, 1500 and 1800.This is way too few calories for almost anyone and it will put the body on starvation alert and provoke a binge response. When are doctors going to be honest and admit that decreasing calories by any more than 200 calories a day will trigger an impulse to overeat in most people? Decreasing your calorie consumption by 500 to 1000 calories a day or more is simply too much. Your body will always fight back."
2,NOT a worthy weightloss book whatsoever,"-Am surprised I bought it...Truly old, old information ""re wrapped"". Would not recommend to anyone for it's lack of updated info."
3,Excellent shipper but book not so great,Not really happy with this book. It does not have very much helpful information and is actually outdated. I reviewed it and will pass it on.
1,Don't Buy,This is a BIG waste of money. I could use any $5 eyeshadow from the drugstore and get the same results. It looks fake and I am throwing it away. Doesn't even make a good eyeshadow! I will continue to use the pencils I have been using throughout the years. They look much more attractive and natural.
2,This is not a good book to study contract theory,"After skimming over this book and reading through some of its chapters, I have to say that it is not a good book for PhD students to study contract theory. Generally speaking, the authors failed to provide a clear explanation of a certain concept before they move hastily into the model analysis in most of the chapters. I do not doubt that they really had a mastery of these concepts, but I often can not get a clear picture of what the problem they talk about in certain chapter is."
1,Full of Mistakes!,"Unfortunately, this version of the series is full of mistakes in the English section. Not just a few, but many, blatant errors. Also, some of the passages are not written in proper English (yes, they are supposed to be). I've bought other versions (different grades) of the series and have run into this problem before, not for every version, but several. So beware, especially if you're not as proficient as an English professor to correct the tests without help from the answer section. Amazon carries other standardized test books that will be of great help to your child."
1,What have I done to you chemistry??,"I bought the book because they said it was good for writing Lab Reports. But no, I can't, The book is so incomplete, he wastes space trying to make it funny and humorous. I'm not gonna write his jokes on my report. Yeah and remember if you didn't copy the whole lab manual on your notebook, you are dumb and you got the highest F."
5,funny and informative,"Great, essential book for orgo lab. Very informative written in an easy to understand and lively manner. Lots of pictures to illustrate set up and key points. Highly recommend."
5,Great organic lab book,"This book covers basic laboratory procedures as well as explaining some of the instruments used in an organic chemistry lab. The topics covered include basic safety, how to keep a notebook, how to use handbooks, glassware, microscale glassware, syringes, drying agents, various experiments, LOTS of chromatography, NMR and a few other choice topics that will come in handy in lab. What I really like about Zubrick is his conversational tone along with a great sense of humor, there are many times you will truly laugh out loud when reading. This is a great book for those in a general organic lab/those with no prior organic lab experience.Feel free to pick up an older edition of this book, since there aren't many changes between the newer editions."
2,I guess it could be worse,I found this guide not as helpful as it could have been. It is still very wordy and too sarcastic. Every week I do my class reading with Zubrick telling me how dumb I would be if I did this. I'm not sure that counts as witty.
2,not worth the money,"All the information found in the book can be found on the internet. For the amount of money charged for this book, the authors coul have afforded to have some colored, and realistic pictures in the book. I only used it at the beginning of the term, then it became totally useless. Better informations are available through the internet for free."
5,Exactly what I ordered,"While a little used, it was still in great condition and exactly what I need to help me through my Organic Chemistry class!"
3,Works but received a different item,"Its a power block, it works hard not to, but the item that i received is not what is pictured."
5,Couldn't be better!,"What a terrific story! This book truly encompasses all the ""fun"" Easter traditions of egg hunts and baskets of chocolatey treats, etc., while finishing with an enthusiastic and upbeat description of the true meaning of the season - Jesus and His love for us! It would have been *perfect* if the darling illustrations had included a boy more prominently...even so, my 2 boys loved it!"
3,Original was better.,"I bought this book years ago for my daughter and recently decided to buy a copy for my grandchildren. However, the more recently published book has completely different illustrations that are not nearly as sweet as the original. The modern illustrations look more cartoonish. Shame. I know the book is about the message, but the other illustrations made the book extra special because they looked like a child author had drawn parts of them, and the book is in first person (a child)."
2,Kentuky fried switch,"I bought the predecessor to this switch (the PN108ES) and it literally went up in smoke - a chip near the power jack burned to the point where it melted itself off the PCB. I've been hesitant to buy another Hawking switch, but Hawking provided this replacement under warranty.Update, 8 years later: The replacement switch died. I cut power to the attic where the switch was, and when I restored power, the Hawking's power light came on, but nothing else worked. No network lights, no packets flowing. At least it didn't melt down this time.Replacing it with another brand."
1,Save your money,"Not worth the price. The hat came basically bunched up in a ball. It was so bad, it could not be re-shaped correctly."
5,Spidey's Best 2-D Sidescroller,"This game is 100% from the comic book. Spider-Man jumps and uses his special powers like web crawling, web shooting, and other uses with his web shooters. The Rhino, Doc Ock, Mysterio, Hobogoblin, The Lizard, Carnage, and Venom."
1,Save your money - buyer beware!,This may be creative with pretty graphics and pictures but is probably the worst software I've ever bought. Neither myself nor my two very computer-literate children could figure out how to get the interactive story to run. I called the support line in Europe and they also did not know. The instructions that accompany it were also not helpful. I finally sent email to the support group and they never answered my email. I'm very disappointed with this software.
5,Great product. Well built and good looking.,"My son, 3yrs, loves this plane. His legs are just a little short to work the pedals, but that will soon be solved in time. I'm sure he will love flying this around for years to come.My only complaint is the leather seat. It is adhered to the metal directly below. For me, i thought it should be cushioned, so I unsnapped the connections and pealed it back and put some furniture padding underneath. It was not complicated, but given the overall quality of the rest of the product, it felt like an oversight. Overall a 5 though."
4,Anyone else have a problem?,"I've provided a high rating because these are wonderful ROAD pictures with the great Hope and Crosby, and based upon RIO, the transfer looks very nice.But I have been unable to access ROAD TO BALI from the menu. It keeps going back to ROAD TO RIO. I spent half an hour trying. Are these discs defective?"
4,Fun to watch,"The whole ""Road"" series of films is just fun. The actors are having fun, and so do the viewers. Nothing heavy here -- no great messages, but you'll enjoy your evening when you watch it."
3,Excellent look at Neurophysics and Computatinal Processes of Neurons,"I am still about 1 half a year away from having all of the math and biology needed to understand ALL of this book, but it's descriptions of single-unit computational processes are clear and easy to parse even without a the additional math and biology.That said, this IS a book for professionals and students of Computational Neuroscience. It is not intended for a lay audience."
4,it works,"although a bit long, the author gets his point across in an if not literary, at least interesting style of writing. I especially found chapter 2 interesting because the introduction is easy to read and gives you just enough background for non-neurology dudes to get the hang of the rest of the book. the topic is one that has interested me for many years, and has gotten me seriously thinking about changing my college major. very interesting book. a must read."
4,Smooth creme,"I like this creme, it seems to go into the skin nicely. Does not leave the skin greasy feeling or sticky after using."
3,Preaches to choir,"Tubs always pulled out enough minor tweakings to mark each of his projects with a distinct flavor despite their uncanny familiarities, but even with a sweet-natured grooveability ever present, compiling many works from the artist remains squarely for the avid dub enthusiast."
5,"Dion & The Belmonts ""Together Again(And More) Cd","What a really great CD of rare Tracks by Dion & The Belmonts aswell as other stuff by the Belmonts. When I first purchased this CD, I couldn't stop playing it. However the audio quality is so so on some tracks but don't let that stop you from buying it. Alot of great stuff and like the other reviewer here mentioned, these maybe the only copies available of some of these recordings outside of the original ABC lp itself."
1,not what I expected,"From the picture, I thought I was getting a soft green and white rug that was really big, and suttle. That is not at all what I got. this product was so weird. It was like hard plastic, and was a terrible bright green. I sent it back."
5,Excellent Small Keyboard!,"I bought this keyboard to use with my laptop in our motorhome. I have a slide-out keyboard shelf that will work only with a keyboard that has no number pad on the right. This little keyboard is absolutely perfect and has full-sized keys, not miniature keys like some. I am a fairly fast typist that is used to a regular sized keyboard so that was a definite factor in my purchase. The keys press easily and have a very good feel to them. I suspect I can type just as fast or faster on this little keyboard as I can at home on my large, expensive Microsoft keyboard. I love it!"
2,UM,"Great and fast delivery, informative book that helps with Early Childhood assignments! No problems at all throughout the experience, knew exactly what I was purchasing. Had to buy this book for one of my classes but wasn't a massive fan of the book itself...difficult to read and navigate through."
3,good,"This seller sent very quickly. Came almost as described (there were more markings than I had expected, and much of it was pen instead of pencil). I do, however, appreciate the speed with which this was done."
4,Good reading,Bought the book as part of the references for my dissertation work. It raises some very good issues with regard to what I am researching.
1,I never received this item.,Amazon informed me this item was not available. I gave up and purchased it at Office Max.
5,Swinging Danceable Big Band Jazz and Blues,Gee's CD recorded live at a New York Swing Dance Society Sunday Night Dance (in its 15th year of weekly dances) is the best danceable real jazz big band CD made in recent years. Do you think you know Shiny Stockings -- this CD has a special arrangement for Gee by Frank Foster who originally wrote the song for Count Basie. Plus original songs. You will listen to this and dance to it -- the only other recent swing CD's that is of this quality and style is Lavay Smith's. Both Lavay and Gee could be set back in the 30's and would pack people in.
4,Surviving Adolescence,"Confused how to be a good Christian teenager? Well, here's the cool and perfect book for Christian adolescents. This book deals with most of the issues and problems faced by the modern adolescents, such as peer pressure, learning to like yourself, friends and self-esteem, etc. Thus, it also teaches us how to tackle the problems the ""correct"" way in God's eyes. As Christian teenagers, we tend to face many obstacles, but have no clue how to deal with it. This book is really radical and will answer your inquisitive minds. You will know how to decipher what our Heavenly Father approves of, or what he doesn't. I highly recommend this book to all you baffled Christian adolescents out there. At the end of the chapter, you can refer to a study guide for each topic and notes are included. Trust me, Survivng Adolescence is one book which can help you become a good adolescent."
3,mango dango,"It is a good product, it does well wicking moisture. The pockets on the sides are a little small, but are conveniently located. It is a little short and rides up a little when cycling."
5,good product,This was delivered quickly and easy to install.Next year I'll buy it again on amazon.com.
1,Don't buy it!,"Did HOlmes really make good filters beside the ones thet selled the humindifier with? I have been buying refills, but no one lasted.. one week and it stinks very bad.... very bad quality filters"
5,Another arbruatory review,This card rocks it is perfect & works like a charm i love it& it even comes with a case 2 hold it & any other xd cards u may have . The instruction booklet is totally interactive & u will have no problem understanding once u can read.I love it & highly reccommend it to any& every 1.
1,Does not work with Olympus C-50,Be warned: this memory card is not compatible with the Olympus C-50 camera. The best you can get in the 128.
5,Lovely,It is so hard to find the older Merrymen music tapes and CDs. Know I will enjoy this one for years to come!
5,Clinical psychopharmacology made ridiculously simple,Clinical Psychopharmacology Made Ridiculously Simple (6th Edition) (Medmaster Ridiculously Simple)I liked this book because it goes straight to the hardcore of the problem. It also gives you a general information on disorders and clues on the prescription process.I like that.
3,book review,"I did not think this book provided alot of information of value. I believe that it should be used along with the manual of clinical psychopharmacology to receive the most benefit. On its own,it is difficult to follow."
3,"Book Good, Previous Smoker Owned the book, needs Febreezing!",The book is helpful for understanding about the use of psychotropic medications for various diagnoses; some risks are presented in a simple manner. I purchased this book to review some of the meds prescribed for our foster children and adult customers. Often children and adults are prescribed a boat load of medications without adequate explanation of use and side effects. The side effects and reactions with some natural herbs are mentioned. Would like more about diet and nutrition for folks on these medications.
1,Poor Product,Not at all as described. can definitely do without. It does not add anything that a drug book doesn't already contain.
2,I have not received this item,I have not received this item so I would rate it if I had received it. I have not received this item so I would rate it if I had received it.
3,Nothing Special,"This motercross game lacks one of the best part or motercross, tricks. I really wanted to perform all the moves that Jeremy McGragh can. But all there really is, is the race aspect of motercross. You can perform 1 trick when you go over a jump, which happens so fast and unregonisable that it's not worth it. There are lots of courses and 3 classes of bike, 80, 125, and 250cc. But they can be completed without much trouble and replay value is poor. The graphics are another thing, this is supposed to be a Gameboy Color only game, meaning better graphics, but i didn't see anything special. There are better racing games available."
2,"Jeremy McGrath supercross world, only 2 stars award","This game on the game boy color isn't so cool as the producers said. You only can choose about 6 riders. Kevin Windham, Greg Albertyn, John Downd, Jimmy Button, Travis Pastrana and Jeremy McGrath. Its to bad you first have to race 80cc, then 125cc and then 250cc. The 250 bikes have to much speed and the brakes doesn't worck always. The 80cc is way to slow. The 125cc is not to slow but you can't really puch in moments you need and like I said before, the 250 have to much speed. You can always save the game if you have paswords. The tracks aren't build logic. To many corns, and not enough jumps + you have to win the 80cc, then the 125cc and afther that, you must win the 250cc before you can race with McGrath himself. You can't really see who is who, I mean, you can't see who is Jimmy Button, and who is Jeremy McGrath.I just wanted to say 1 thing is pretty cool.If you have won, you can ride with a 250 bike on a bonus track."
4,Summer Camp with the Wunderkinder,"This is a great story, but I've got to admit that its not for the Salinger beginner. It tells the the story of two brothers (Buddy and Seymour Glass) at summer camp. The crazy thing about these two kids, however, is that they can do outrageous things like memorize entire books and stop the flow of blood to wounded parts of their body. The story is very heavy with religious references (in fact, a portion of the story comes off as being like some sort of eastern mythology reading list), and the writing style is very sophisticated. In other words, its hard to read. But if you've read Salinger's other works and are familiar with the exploits of the Glass Family, or if you have a sincere interest in the meaning and mystery of life, this is a must buy. Do yourself a favor and read it."
3,Good to hear it will be between covers.,"I have read ""Hapworth 16, 1924."" It is not, I regretfully announce, J.D. Salinger at the top of his form. But if you enjoyed, for example, ""Raise High the Roof Beam Carpenters"" and ""Seymour: An Introduction,"" you will likely enjoy this as well: It is cut from the same cloth. And (assuming that, in fact, Orchises Press DOES finally get the book printed, bound, and out the door) it will be nice to see it -- and have it available -- as a true book. Mr. Salinger, a bouquet of late-blooming parentheses to you, old sport. (((((((((())))))))))))"
1,???,"I ordered this book, but never received it. That is unusual, because I have ordered other items since with no problem."
3,"International espionage, quick chapters, and a headlines-driven plot","Cold Hit has all the key aspects for a television movie of the week. Shane Scully and his partner Zach Farrell, detectives with the LAPD, are investigating a potential serial killer. Unable to solve the case, the FBI is called in by the LAPD brass to help lead the investigation. Shane clashes with the lead FBI man, as he fights to keep his partner's personal troubles out of the line of fire. Once Zach is hospitalized, Shane works on a related cop killer case with two detectives from the Counter Terrorism Bureau, Roger Broadway, and Emdee Perry. They risk their lives as they dig deeper into the conspiracy and realize how close to home the corruption goes. A good read but lacks some literary zing as a police thriller."
2,Crank up the cliché machine,"Far too many clichés in this one. Typically, Cannell delivers a solid plot that distracts from the stereotypes that fill the pages, but this time the plot is too far-fetched and worse still, he uses it to pontificate about the violations of our civil rights spawned by the Patriot Act and, in a confusing contrast, the laws that ""allow"" criminals too much latitude. The blowhards and burnouts are just too predictable and lack any original touches that might humanize them. Way too neat and tidy - kind of like this guy was writing for television...no, wait, he DID write for TV."
5,Cannell Gets Better With Every Book,"I really liked this one. I have read every SHANE SCULLY book so far and this is the best one yet.A complex plot is told in a uncluttered manner.One thing that CANNELL excels in is character dialogue. The use of police jargon and one characters down home southern quips is classic stuff.SCULLY is called to investigate a homicide in which it would appear is the latest victim of a serial murderer in LA. As certain facts common to the other victims dont add up in this one, SCULLY gets the feeling this is the work of a copycat. Soon the FBI is heading up a task force and the powers of the Patriot Act are at play. This story delves into the ramifications of abuses of power and the FISA court and unaccountable federal agents. There is a subplot dealing with SCULLY's alcoholic partner that gets old fast but over all a very fast paced story."
4,Statistics and Data Analysis Review,This book was the assigned text for a graduate level statistics course I took. It is well written with examples for every technique discussed and lots of exercises at the end of each chapter. I highly recommend it.
1,bad quality,"The book binding quality of this book version is very bad. I have used it a few times and the binding broke, pages came loose. I have lost interest using the book although its content is well done. The poor quality comes close to cheap book reprints that you can buy in India."
2,The quality of the book,"The contents of the book is good but the quality of the book is very bad. Even though the book is new, the pages in it started to fall off from the book when I was using it for a few times. I don't recommend anyone to go for this print version."
1,wackest cd ever,"could this get any more wack...how corny could it get...on ""my perspective"" he says ""type of guy to poke a kid in da eye / then cry / turn around and say oh boy i wanna die."" that is some stupid rhymes right there...and it gets worse, dont buy this piece of garbage im sorry i ever did. this guy gives white rappers a bad name."
1,Disappointing,"After reading the cover blurb, I couldn't wait to read this first book in a new series set in the South. It sounded like just the kind of book I enjoy. I was disappointed to find that the South portrayed in this book had little basis in reality. I found the plot to be weak, but what really killed this book was the characters. They were cartoonish and stilted. The storyline could not possibly flow when they were such boulders of improbability in the stream. I almost felt I was reading the work of a student who had only heard about the South. I would return this book for a refund if possible. I read 112 pages and couldn't stand any more. I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews here before buying."
1,"disappointing, characters are sterotypes, not real","I was very disappointed in this first effort. It is one of the few books I have had to force myself to read. Both the characters are written as stereotypes - the ""Southerner"" and the ""damnyankee"". The plot line is good, but was spoiled by the shallowness of the characters. I read 3-5 mysteries a week, and this is the first one I have wanted to return to the publisher."
1,ugh,"Cartoon characters and overdone-with-the-word-""be"" ebonics, that's what I will remember most about this book."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this USB switch to allow for sharing a wireless keyboard with two computers. It came with cables and was easy to install. Both computers recognized it and shared the wireless keyboard/mouse. However the USB switch would not get recognized during bootloader menu(Dual boot, Win7 and Ubuntu), so couldn't select which OS to boot into. Then the unit stop working as the buttons are very cheaply made, buttons felt like they broke inside switch. Replaced it with a kensington sharecentral 2 on another site for 1/3 the price, and is quality product(plus works in bootloader menu)."
3,Good but troubles at time,"This works perfect with my mac, but couldn't get the PC to work with it. Admittedly I think it may be an issue with the PC not seeing it due to the switching nature. I think the PC itself has issues, but I've decided to not use it and just remote log into the PC from the mac."
3,Radio woof,Radio woof is a person with some other people who likes folk music and plays some funny songs.
2,Not what I expected,I purchased this title because I had the same one previously. I knew it to be a good dictionary though the print is not the best. But what bothered me the most is the fact there seems to be no order. I can find words under the specific letter but some words do not appear where they should and I don't want to waste time searching for them. I have not opened it again since first trying to locate words I know should be there. I was a little disappointed.
1,Should have bought used...,Why did I bother buying this book new from Amazon if it came with bent pages and a mangled cover?
5,The newlyweds loved this gift,what a unique wedding gift accompaniment! I like to add a little something extra with the card and check when I go to a wedding :)
1,"early, not better","I bought a copy of this CD after hearing Steve play piano at The Lone Palm around 1995 or so. Wanted to support local artists, etc. It is quite simply horrible. I've heard and danced to the Rumba Bums many times since then and think that their performances are fine. But this album is not. Look to his later work."
4,Basic,"This is good for those who just want to get started with apologetics, but it wasn't what I was looking for. I already knew pretty much everything it talked about."
1,A Nobel Prize for Stupid?,"If there were, Fogel would have a chance to add a second Prize to his earlier one for Economics. Consider this book purporting to describe the wellsprings of social improvement in America, to the present -- and focusing on its popular, rhetorical wellsprings -- with one index entry for ""Progressivism"" and none beginning ""Socialism, ""Workers,"" or ""Communism."" In fact, according to Fogel social progress has come about due to technological change and church preachers responding to it. Mother Jones was just a mother (my characterization, Fogel's vacuity). That a Nobel Prize winner could publish such tripe I think has dumbfounded almost everyone, so little commented upon has this book been. But if you put stock in others' opinions and read history, take my word for it, this is an very poor amateur history by a non-historian with a Nobel Prize. If you don't, and have a brain in your head, buy it and weep."
2,A 300 page Introduction,"The author of this book seems to have hit upon an interesting structuring of American history, but fails to provide much in the way of new analysis or interesting predictions. I felt as if the entire book was an introduction and prelude to an argument that would actually say something productive. The constant repetition of incomes and health statistics simply confirm the common sense conlusion about where we have gone with material prosperity without providing any real insight into the state of the Union today, or where we can or will go in the future. We will be healthier and richer, with a greater portion of our income spent on higher education in coming years. Swell. Tell us something a fifth grader couldn't predict. I suppose it does give some valuable context to current issues concerning egalitarianism, but wait for the paper-back. The work is anything but ""bold"". Disappointing is a more appropriate description."
2,so-so,Coins were very hard to unwrap. The flavor at first is pretty good but it fades really fast. Quite disappointed.
5,Fuzzy Sapiens,"Fuzzy Sapiens (The Other Human Race)The sequel to Little Fuzzy, this book introduces more fuzzies and turns the chief adversary of Little Fuzzy into one of the good guys. A fast-paced adventure considering what happens when unscrupulous humans try to corrupt innocent and talkative fuzzies by enslaving them and having them pull off a heist. The fuzzies involved have other plans and once the good guys are involved, it's all over for the baddies. A satisfying romp, leaving fuzzy fans wanting more."
1,"Not enough fuzzy, too much politics","The cover is really cute and cuddly, but the story is surprisingly dull. Whole chapters are devoted to guys arguing about the political and social implications of the fuzzy critters, and very little thought was put into the stuff that makes a scifi novel a scifi novel. In other words, too much ""tell,"" and not enough ""show."" Harry the explainer is the center of attention, rather than the fuzzy critters that the title derives from."
2,"Problem with the lights, horn, etc","My grandson loves this truck, but we cannot get the lights,horn,sounds buttons to work. Has anyone else had this problem or know how to correct it. We have changed the batteries. This is a brand new truck puchased for Christmas."
5,great toy,My five year old grand son loves this truck. He plays with it every time he visits us. He says its his favorite toy. It is built to last & I am very glad we bought it.
3,The swing-thing is in!,"What a truism! -- What goes arround, comes arround. Here we have Johnny Favourite and his Swing Band. It's trendy, it's hip and it's well put together. while polished and practiced, it doesn't spark or create the compelling urge to sit up and take notice.... I could well imagine this floating as background music as the local java bar....."
3,Beyond Deep Purple,"Not what you would expect from a previous memeber of Deep Purple. Lots of influences from Country and Western and Gospel and even a little back woods Folk. Very mellow and yet also at times having a foot tapping tempo, you will like this if you are a fan of Dylan, Ryan Adams, Tom Petty or Wilco. At times the vocals even sound a little like Chris Rea.If you like the new fusion of Country and Western with smooth rock then you will enjoy this CD"
5,"A Well Rounded Album, Well Worth a Listen","I was unsure if I should buy ""Snapshot."" From all appearances, it hardly seemed hard rocking. It's not. What it is is a collection of well-written, well-played songs. What else should I have expected from the bassist of one of the best rock bands ever?The first song, ""My Turn,"" is quite catchy and I was instantly enthralled with Randall Bramblett's voice. Present on most of the songs, he brings a subtle charm to the songs. I was pleasantly surprised by ""Burn Me Up Slowly,"" as Glover himself sang lead. This is unusual, as Glover is not known to have a spectacular voice. Though he does not have a striking voice, it fit in with the nature of the song. In contrast, his daughter, on ""The Bargain Basement,"" has a wonderful voice.I've listened to this cd quite a few times and have come to really like quite a few. However, the best song, in my opinion, is ""Queen of England."" A folksy song with a catchy beat, I've easily listened to this song the most on the cd."
4,Mixture of eclectic influences,"Roger Glover is one of the great classic rockers of our time (o.k., my time and that of quite a few other aging individuals). This disc is quite different then DP, ""Mask"", Rainbow, or anything else I have heard RG associated whith, and in that respect displays a side to Roger that I never imagined existed. This work is sort of a folk/rock/new age hybrid. Some of the songs are a little mellow for my liking, but some are completely cool, unique, and intoxicating in their modern day presentation of the type of song recorded in the sixties that you still crank if it pops up on your radio. I can't compare it to anything I've ever heard before, but if you have heard Blackmore's take on ren. music and enjoyed it, you will probably dig on Glover's foray into music the like of which he probably has enjoyed for years and has only now had the opportunity to share whith the likes of us. Turn off the lights, fire up some candels, and listen to this disc - you won't be disappointed."
2,wasted expenditure,"I'm sorry. I can't agree with previous ratings. This is unnecessary CD for me. I have to say ""It will be great disappointing for everyone expecting a fragment of Glover's invention shown under DP""."
2,Typical Textbook Writing style,"Found this textbook to be written like most out there, way to long with confusing wording. The author draws things out that do not need to be. The book is not very concise. I would recommend teachers to find a different textbook to use in class. I would not recommend this book to those looking to learn about Hotel management on their own either."
2,Slow and poorly edited,"I was very disappointed with this book. The premise is excellent--a young woman falling in love with her teacher and going to live with him on an unfamiliar but enchanting island. However, the story takes too long to really get moving, with too much description in some places and too much left to the imagination in others. In addition, the grammar, punctuation, and spelling are full of errors; one of the most irritating, in my opinion, was the inconsistent spelling of one of the characters' names (she was sometimes ""Marian"" and sometimes ""Marion""). I'm glad I got this book out of the library, because buying it would have been a waste of money."
4,It makes life a little easier.,"This gizmo works very well and appears to be well made. I have this device plugged into a wall socket. In turn, I have my clothes iron plugged into this device. Now I don't have to continually ""plug & un-plug"" the clothes iron. When I want to ""un-plug"" the iron, I simply flick the rocker switch on this thing to the OFF position and it cuts the power off to the iron. When the switch is in the ON position, a small red light glows. At a glance you can tell whether it's ON or OFF. This is a great little device. I plan to buy a couple more so I can turn off devices than tend to use electricity even when they are turned off (stereo system, DVD player, cable box, etc.) Note: If you cut power to your cable TV box, it may take several minutes for it to calibrate when you turn it back on."
5,Simply - NO COMPLAINT,I like the product - the Company is excellent to deal with - All is well - I will do it again ! Thank's
4,Appliance Switch,"Nice positive action in the switch and being illuminated is great. Only complaint is that it is not truly white in color, it is slightly offwhite to beige which contrasts against the wall plate."
5,Great reference manual and text!,This was one of my very first books in graduate school and it was the key to understanding all of the literature I'll ever need to read. This text fully explains how to break down highly technical research into easily understandable and useful material. Now I feel confident in picking up any piece of research and knowing whether it is a valid and reliable source of information. I can also apply the same methods to testing materials as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever felt overwhelmed by research.
3,fine,"Typical textbook. Words are kind of tiny, and because oh all the research articles it can be difficult to read. Probably would give it a higher rating if I actually liked the class"
1,Terrible.,"This fell off the first day I had it. It's lost. Poorly designed. Too bad I bought several items at once from this company, because had I known...all their items have either fallen off or broken or caused problems snagging my clothes and ripping them. Never again."
3,Good idea but there are cheaper ones out there,"Besides the sound track sounding like out take SFX from ""Backdraft"" the video quality is pretty good. After I got this tape, I found a cheaper one (to give as a gift) that is just as good by doing a Google search on ""Video Fireplace."""
2,Please consider your safety when buying this video,"We received this video as a gift last Christmas and my girlfriend began playing it without my knowledge. Being acutely aware that we do NOT have a fireplace in our mobile home, I almost crapped when I was awoken to the sounds of a crackling fire. I thought the Christmas tree had gone up, seeing that the cat loved to chew on the cords. My first instinct was to save the kids and bail out through one of the windows, but fortunately I had the courage to actually go in to the living room and check out the situation, unfortunately, my girlfriend, her mother and sister were on the couch and I was only in my underwear. You can probably imagine my embarrassment to discover them all staring at the TV and a video of a fireplace playing in the VCR.I can't possibly imagine why anyone would put this type of stress on their loved ones. I'd recommend against purchasing this video."
4,Very Good,"I saw a dance performance using the music from this CD, and it was wonderful! I highly suggest it!"
4,More than a memoir!,"Excellently written, funny and poignant. A wonderful read for any gender in transition, and can be helpful for partners too."
5,Definitely worth a read...,"Miss Zander has written a well documented account of her journey that will (at the least) get you to think about your own life journey whether your trans or not. Her views on sex, gender and transition are uniquely her own and will challenge you to question your own views of these things.Glad to have the book in my collection. Highly recommended!"
5,favorite conditioner ever,I am just sorry that this product is being discontinued because for my hair nothing works better. And I love the scent as well
2,Too heavy,"I was excited to try this because I had heard celebrities used it, but after using it for a couple weeks, my hair was heavy and wouldn't curl. I felt like it weighed by hair down."
1,my game review,I had been looking for the south park gameboy color version which is also a rare collectors game because few were made and never sold in markets. So when I saw this listing for south park - game boy color I was surprised and decided to try it quick. But I was wrong because they sellers sent me a south park game for nintendo 64. My advice for anyone is if you are trying to get anything rare then make sure its authentic.
3,Great For General/Basic Intro. to Sniper Rifles,"This book is a good intro. to sniper rifles; although it doesn't go into enough detail to make it anything remotely like a field/training manual, it does give the reader a little info. on many different rifles in many different cals. etc. If you'd like to purchase an accurate rifle with sniping accuracy (.5 MOA) and you don't want to spend the big bucks to do it, give this book a read. It will also give you a brief history lesson on various rifles. It's an easy read, and well worth buying."
3,better than standard dvd but not remastered.,"One could have hoped for a better remastering, however this does look alot better than standard dvd ,but it like alot of older movies is going to look flatter on blu ray than a new movie. It doesn't look dirty though and that's something. WIth obscure movies like this you should be glad to get them and bci is out of business so that's it for these movies I guess. They didn't put out much blu ray stuff before they went under either. But I would say martial movie art fans should be happy with this one on blu ray even if it's not remastered fully. I wish all br's were remastered and restored but even mainstream movies may not get that sometimes. And at least they gave you two movies here ,something that more studios should do."
1,Very boring and strictly empirical data.,This book was a very bland. The author simply took information from other authors and put those ideas together to form a book. The author failed to incorporate any of his own thoughts. Each page had more citations than actual composition. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has a choice.
2,Nada Narada,"I thought the songs would be interesting but easy to play. They were easy to play, but pretty boring. I'll never play them after reading them. For this type of music/level I'd suggest George Winston's Piano Solos."
5,Narada New Age Sampler,"Narada New Age Sampler arrived in good condition, and the contents are excellent. I am using the music for therapeutic music in a hospital."
5,"A comprehensive book, with good examples","The authors use clear easy-to-understand algorithms to explain difficult concepts. Carefully selected examples make it very a comprehensive and insightful book. It is a good cookbook for beginning as well as advanced machine vision people. The text is supported by an abundance of figures and graphics. The full C source companion software on CD ROM enables the reader to quickly apply the theory. Altogether indispensable for the researcher and innovator, who will return to this remarkable book again and again."
3,jinkies,"This is a great game for beginner players because it is not a fast-pace game, but it requires some thinking. It is fun to beat it the first time but after that it just gets a little boring. There are only four cases that you can solve in this games though, so it is a very short game when you get the hang of it. There is a fun bonus games in it, scooby's snack stack. Overall it is an okay game."
5,Redline Bmx Decals,"I purchased two sets of Redline decals and both sets were excellent. I was very happy with the end results and how easily they applied. Having used cheap quality decals in the past, I was expecting to have wrinkles or the edges not sticking solid, but these decals were solid. They look good and stick on tight."
4,Bike restoring,This set of decals is perfect for your restore projects. I haven't installed it but I will as soon as I get my Proline's frame painted white / red.
3,Fun game but difficult set up,"The game was fun and once we got it set up we all played it. I bought one for my granddaughter and one for the adults. She loved the game when she played at a friends house so I bought it for her for Christmas. The set up was not easy. The controllers were sluggish when they worked. It got to be a little irritating for the adults. I wasn't with my granddaughter when her game was set up, but she never complained."
5,Grill Parts,"Excellent part replacement, same as original equipment. Good delivery time. Parts are pricey but last for a long time. Recommend for Brinkman grill."
4,"Works great, good price",This filled the need for my hard to fit Brinkman BBQ model. Its holding up nicely and cost a fraction of the standard replacement part.
2,Wannabe Annie movie,"I generally like Shah Rukh Khan's movies, but you should skip this old one. It's pretty much a remake of ""Annie"". Granted, there's more to this movie than an orphan girl coming into the life of a rich man who doesn't want to take care of a little girl, but there's very little to like about this movie. No good songs, no depth in the script, nada!I gave the film an extra star because when I was really little, I did enjoy this movie. But that was probably because I had barely seen any films before this one, including the successful ""Annie"" movie that I really did like."
2,A poor resource,"With six people on the advisory board, you'd think simple mistakes would be avoided. But here it is, with only 8 questions on javelinas, and some pretty awful errors:No pronunciation guide: Up here in the northeast, we were not sure if it was Have-a-leen--az or Ja-va-leen-az. We had to go to another book to be sure. This book is designed for __very__ young readers, who may not have the energy or skill to look things up in the dictionary.Personal possessives: ""Javelinas hair feels scratchy."" Oh, come ON!Should be either, ""A javelina's hair feels scratchy,"" or, ""Javelinas' hair feels scratchy."" (This type of mistake is repeated later in the book; again, this book is designed for very young people and a mistake of this sort could have been easily avoided.)The chief virtue of this book is that there are not many others on this subject. I am reluctant to recommend this title and will try to find something better soon."
3,Stereotypical movie / platform fighter,"I think that whoever makes these games of action movies has a template that they make them from. They take the same character give him the same weaponry and face him off against the same enemies. This game is very long and not very challenging, you can beat in one rental! The graphics are good, the sound really is not, it gets old very quick."
5,sweet,though the price seems high...this is THE best SNES game ever! And I am NOT kidding..this is [money] you will be happy to spend!
5,My sentimental friend,"A special person,a mysterious creature,Shirley!!Amazing voice,romantic and sublime songs in sad and happy rhythms.Relaxing sound and beautiful love poems.For those in love and also out of love.Bassey sings almost right from her soul.She has sense of humours too,just watch her entertainment at 'Live At Carnegie Hall'.I'm her number one FAN.As music is the food to the soul,it can solve spiritual problems.Because life is music and music is life.It can mend a broken heart and cure madness.I keep good memories of my parents who passed away almost at the same time.Bassey's songs keep me remember them and how wonderful it was when they were there.Remember always that every family has somebody to love and somebody to lose.They live forever in your heart especially with Bassey's songs."
4,"Very Graphic, explaining the phisyology & clinic","It's hard to find a EKG book that explains the phisyology of the EKG and not just the formality thats in it.It comes fully colored and ilustrated, including many examples.Not rather simple, but very complete, explaining the WHY? beneath every single thing."
4,remington,my hair is a bit frizzy and rough ..nd needs a high Temp to straighten it..which this provides quite well..i would recommend gettin a hair spray along with this for a better effect
3,ok product but found one by conair that works better,This flat iron does not get hot enough to effectively style your hair - found one @ walmart for approx. $15-17 that works much better. I would not buy this again after using the conair product.
5,THE BEST!!!,I am so not a reviewer unless a product does everything it promises which is very rare. I relax my 4a/b hair but I still needed a straightner and this one surely delivered. It didnt dry my hair even though I used a heat protectant. When I would flat iron with the ones you put in the hair oven (like at a hair shop) my hair had hardly any shine or bounce and was left dry again even though I used a heat protectant. Not the case with this one and I only had it on 170 degrees. I like that it heats up fast and does this blowing thing so it doesnt get hot on the outside. Would recommend this product to every person that wants straight hair with shine.
3,You might be a redkneck,"Each day has a seperated ""You might be a redneck"" joke, Sat and Sun are together on one sheet. Each one starts ""You Might be a Redneck if"" followed by the punchline. there are many old ones such as ""Your satelite dish has more square footage than your home"". and new ones such as ""you work on your car when there is nothing wrong with it"". There is no illustrations as in the books. This does make it practicle for writting information on the calendar. The day and date is in the lower right hand corner, Special Days on the left. Some of the jokes are funny, some are not so funny. It would be hard to come up with 300 different ""You might be a redneck"" jokes for the entire year."
4,Good book on basics,Good book on the basics of Docks. Great to help you decide what kind of dock or type of material. Not so hot if you want information on repairing an existing dock. Once you have the basic understanding your decision will still be based more on Zoning and local laws than anything else and you will want to get more specific information on the dock you are building.
4,Great information!,Very thorough. Just the information I needed to determine what type of dock to build on my lakefront property.
3,Somewhat Uninspiring,"There's little in the problems identified by this book or in the solutions suggested that I would disagree with. However, I didn't really learn anything new and surprising from it either.This book may have its place as a beginner's supplement to Meyer's _Effective C++_ books and Sutter's _Exceptional C++_ books. I wouldn't recommend it for advanced C++ programmers, though."
4,Really not bad.,"There are dozens books about C++ on the market and this one is clearly under the top ten. It's a wonderful book for beginners and programmers at an intermediate level. For the pros it's fun to read it, because: I made all this mistakes a few years ago. The perhaps only flaw ( I found in the whole book only one real mistake, or my compiler (gcc) is wrong , and I know it's not) of this book: it's too short. If you are making your first steps in C++, then buy this book."
4,"Very good, but not great","Overall, it's a good book worth reading, but it's not as great as Scott Meyers' two Effective C++ volumes. There are topics that this book merely or partially rehash Meyers', but the explanations, IMHO, are not as good. Nevertheless, it's a newer book with elaboration on design patterns and their applications."
5,I'm asking the auther about the new edition.,"Dear Auther, I'm a Botanist in Egypt and I wanna buy your last edition of this book published by Oxford University Press but ther's nothing about its price or way to buy. magdy_gado@yahoo.com"
4,Very Good Game,"I expected this game would be very easy.It was not.Even though it had lots of cool new weapons,a Stun Missile,a Stun Torpedo,a General Purpose Laser,(three of those),and a gauss gun,and some returning weapons,a shield laser,a hull laser,a scatter gun,a plasma cannon,a plasma missile,and a plasma torpedo,it was very challenging.And you don't fight the League hardly any in the game.And the Navy are traitors late in the game.You also fight some aliens,the Sha'Har,and ally some other people,the Darogothans.In fact the League at the end ally you! Aside these few problems,Colony Wars Red Sun is a very good game."
4,cool game,"I have never played any other of the colony wars games, and now I finally have! This game is fun, actionpacked, and cool special effects. It is alot like starfox, but you can go anywhere you want. I gave it four stars because after awhile, its just the same thing over and over. But then again, starfox was too."
5,colony wars rocks!,"I loved colony wars 1 and 2, but red sun is the best one so far. It has better level, better guns, better ships. Colony wars is the best!"
3,A solid game that could have been better,"I will be honest and admit that I am a huge fan of this series from Psygnosis, however I feel cheated in some respects after finishing this game. The gameplay has been greatly improved from Vengeance and the graphics are lot more fluid in terms of details, but something is missing from this game. Maybe its the substance of the story or the lack of it. Personally Valdemar's story was not all that interesting to me. I rather like the feel of the first game where you are a nameless pilot fighting on the front lines of a tremendous civil war. That is just my opinion. In short, the game is a great mindless shooter with some spectacular effects and a few interesting missions. However the cons are ineffective enemy AI and repetitive mission goals (blow everything up)."
5,A Classic,"Lady Dragon is the blueprint that countless martial arts films are built from. The action scenes are incredible and the star, Cynthia Rothrock is a wonder to watch."
2,Not too good,The christmas music sounds like it is coming from an elevator in a...store. Even worse you can't hear the fire sounds.
3,"So, so","The fires good, but they play the same song twice in a row before they start the next one. (...)"
5,mind numbingly stunning,"it's hard to even adequately describe what Geisha accomplishes with this record. Probably the best bet is to imagine Jesus Lizard playing shoegaze...with an emphasis on the shoegaze. Loud distorted screaming augmented by just this swirling mass of sound. Just plain extraordinary. I have no idea where these guys came from, but they need to start putting out more records. Now!"
1,HASN'T TOUCHED IT!,MY HUSBAND AND I PURCHASED THIS FOR OUR 15 MONTH OLD SON FOR CHRISTMAS. HE SAT ON IT MAYBE TWICE IN THE PAST MONTH. IT IS VERY DURABLE AND LIGHTWEIGHT TO CARRY FROM ROOM TO ROOM...BUT NOT MUCH GOING ON IN THE EXCITMENT DEPARTMENT. IT IS CUTE TO LOOK AT BUT THAT'S IT. WE HAVE A THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD WHO AREN'T INTERESTED IN IT EITHER.
4,A MUST have!!!,"My daughter received the Angelfish Rocker for her first ""real"" Christmas (14 months). It has been a wonderful addition to our family. She has never been bored with it; it's light weight, so you can bring it inside in the winter, and it's thin enough that it doesn't take up too much space in the playroom! Not only has it been used by our daughter, but we have also added twins to our family who are now 16 months old. They LOVE this toy, especially our boy. He is a little monkey and loves to climb on everything! Someone previously wrote a review stating that this toy tips and is top-heavy, but the only time we have had a problem with that was when our boy twin was playing on it inapproperately. THIS IS A WONDERFUL TOY, A WONDERFUL PURCHASE AND I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH GOOD ABOUT IT!!!"
1,Dangerous for toddlers,"My child is 17 months old, and has out grown several rocking type toys. Unfortunately this rocking fish is way to narrow for it's height, it's top heavy. On the one and only day my child tried to play with it, she toppled it over 3 times while trying to get in it. While trying to pull herself into the thing, the light weight of the unit causes the child to pull it over. This toy has not been well designed for a toddler."
2,Safe but my child grew bored,"I've had this a little over 8 months now and while my child has never been hurt using it, she and several other children we've had over, grow bored quickly after only a few rocks on it. I'm not saying it's a bad toy but with our experience it's not the greatest."
2,Not exactly as it seemed,"I thought this product was rubber and heavy duty, but it is actually hard plastic. It does seem fairly durable, but whenever we try to drive onto it, it slips forward. There are sticky tapes to stick it down, but with the force of a car, how long do you think that will last? Also, the 1st hump you drive over is too high which makes it slide forward more. We had to cut that hump off and, as a precaution we filled the larger hump with concrete. This works fine except for the little bit of concrete dust that comes out when it does slide a little. The product we previously had from an Auto store worked much better, except it eventually cracked. A full rubber one would be best, but if you fill one from the auto store with concrete, you would have a very good product fairly inexpensively."
5,That was easy,"I've had this in my garage for almost 3 years, and I would definitely buy another if I had a 2 car garage. I looked at the laser things and figgured you need to adjust it every time you change cars. This you do too, but all you do is move it. It stays in place well, as long as you don't turn the wheel while you're parked on it. (Duh). It moves maybe 1 inch during the week, so I just push it back with my foot. I marked where the corners are on the floor with a marker so I can always put it in the right place when it moves or when I hose it off. Go buy one, it's great, simple, and it works."
1,Does not work for me,Was too light and could not feel it with my car. Need a much heavier version ..
2,Lots of Bent Pieces,"I ordered a couple dozen of these to retrofit my house. The flush fit definitely gives the recessed lights a more finished and attractive look. But, about 1/3 of all the pieces delivered were bent, either due to warehouse mishandling, or inadequate packaging."
4,"""You fight like a baby. A DEAD baby.""","OK, I am admittedly an unabashed Jemaine Clement fan and think that Flight of the Conchords is one of the best comedy shows on TV right now. But in all honesty, I really didn't have high expectations for this film at the beginning. I thought it was likely to be a low-budget, testosterone-drenched, comedic tribute/spoof of Kung Fu movies. And...well...yes, that's exactly what it turned out to be. But to my surprise, it also turned out to be an amazingly entertaining film and one that had me in stitches at several points. And it's OK if you're like me and aren't really that familiar with all the ninja stuff that's being alluded to throughout the plot. All you need to appreciate this film is a sense of humor and an appreciation of the absurd."
4,Tongan Ninja,"A bit disappointing that Jemaine is not in this movie as much as we had hoped, but overall its pretty entertaining especially if you can allow yourself to take it for what it is- a spoof on old ninja flicks with silly overdub and sweet moves :-)"
4,A Great Mockery,"This movie is hilarious if you enjoy stupid humor. A great mockery of martial arts films and old school dubbed Asian imports. As long as you expect it to be bad, and realize it is bad for a reason, you will enjoy this!"
2,Neighbors,I found the book to be very difficult to read. I had made up some questions to help me to understand but so far I haven't been able to answer them correctly! 1. What has shaped my frame of reference to my neighbor? 2. What has been my type of activism? 3. What has been my response to my neighbor 4. How has the concept of social affinity affected my beliefs regarding how I should respond to my neighbor? Can someone please help me to answer these questions for my understanding.
4,A must read,"If you are a student of the international system or international relations this is a must read. It should be considered the second part in a five volume set. The first should be something about world systems theory by Wallerstein, a reader will do, then Fernand Braudel's Perspective of the World, followed by Hopkins and Wallertein's Age of Transition. For the final book I recommend Robert Gilpin's response to these works, The Challenge of Global Capitalism published in 2000."
2,Not Pleased,I was very disappointed in this book. The photos are of very low quality and the typeface is so small it's a very uncomfortable read. That is only second to the fact the information provided is lacking in depth. Very superfluous. I have a Bachelor's in Fine Art and am a painter. I was hoping this book would add to my knowledge of art history and the themes visited by painters throughout the years. It didn't. Not recommended.
2,"General info is good, but inaccurate details","I have used the Haynes manuals before (for motorcyles) which have always been very good. This one for the car is not very accurate, though. For general information about overall maintenance it is worthwhile, but for the specific details in completing a repair it is sometimes grossly in error. I replaced the hood release cable, and 75% of their directions were wrong. Also, for replacing the coolant they fail to mention the drain plug on the engine (where about half of the coolant is stored) - they only mention the drain plug on the radiator. I know this because I also got the factory service manual on CD on the auction site. I would recommend getting both this book, for general maintenance info, and the factory service manual for specific procedures. Don't rely on this book alone, though, or you will be misguided."
2,For Acura Integra 1994-2000 Users,"While the Haynes Manuals are really great, I would not recommend this book for owners of Acura Integras. Not enough information. Pictures and information not customized for Acura users. Mostly pictures, etc for Hondas.Book arrived in not so great condition. In fact, it had dirt and grease on it. Not impressed."
3,"OK, but no Helms manual","I bought this to learn more about working on my car, and I am very mechanically inclined. I've since bought a Helms manual from ebay (used) and that is 100 times better than this manual. Not to say that this manual is no good, it's just not as good as the Helms. One thing is that it covers a couple of different models, where my Helms covers my particular year, make, and model car, with all the factory diagrams and torque values. This is decent though, and I like having both for reference."
5,Used manual is in great condition!,Just what I needed to keep my 98 Honda Civic humming. The price was less than half the cost of a new one even with shipping included. I wouldn't hesitate for a second ordering books from Scouter Page's Book Shop!
5,Sweet Dreams by Ace Cannon,I believe this CD is one of Ace Cannon's best album. The only thing keeping me from buying it is the price. I have quite a few of his albums and love them all.
4,Dancin' Fever Jump Blues,"This is my favorite release from Flat Top Tom. He and his group have laid down a hot album of jump blues dance tunes that will keep your feet moving on the dance floor. His gritty low-down jive carries through every number, with each song building on the previous one. I frequently put this one on at home and dance the entire album with my partner. There is a thorough selection of fast and slow tunes, perfect for your Swing home party."
2,Flattop made some flat blues,"While the blues riffs and styles may be above average, the quality of the recording itself is poor and many of the song styles are repetitive (about 10 tracks too many on this disc). This may be the blues, but using the same you'll find nearly the same drum rythmns and patterns across all songs. That, coupled with the recording itself isn't rich in sound: the bass guitar and drums produce the same level of bass that the saxophone and piano do. It all ends up detracting from what could have been a really swinging CD."
5,The best way to tell you mom thanks!,"I challenge you to read this book as a child and not become emotional. Noah's simple quotations will inspire and motivate you. I loved the book so much, I bought an extra copy for myself. Trust me, you'll enjoy it and so will your mom."
5,Wonderful,"I really enjoy the novel titled ""the 13th channel, it's pretty interesting, imagine a novel you would read and laugh, smile and giggle alongside, that is to tell you exactly how interesting it is.. So, if you are a lover of interesting novel that could easily ease your worries, then go for this.Thank you."
3,Great soap but....,"Let me start by saying that this soap does what it says. It definitely moisturizes and gets you very clean, even after a workout. However, I won't buy it again because the stuff melts like butter in the shower. We can't get a bar of this to last longer than a week and that's only taking 1 shower daily (there's two of us). I could understand if it was used more but Safeguard does an even better job and lasts three times as long. This is a great soap - I just wish they could change it enough to last longer."
5,This CD is great!,"I have never really been a huge fan of swing music, but after reading the previous review about it.. I was curious. Let me say that I was not disappointed! This is such a fun, entertaining CD.. it captures the total essence of swing. The best tracks are ""big shot"" and ""julie chimelowski"" which are not only musically wonderful, but entirely hilarious. Kirk Wall, especially, stands out on this recording as an amazing singer with the perfect velvet voice. The band backs him up perfectly and the whole thing put together make for a really great time! TRY IT"
1,So Disappointed,"I read the reviews that said that this piano doesn't sound great, and I thought it would be okay. But it's really bad. Not only is the sound grating, but it's poorly made. The side was unglued and the keys wobble around like they're stuck on there with sticky tack. This product changed my opinion of the Melissa and Doug brand."
3,Cute piano,"Pink piano is cute. Sound isn't great, but not horrible. Half the keys stopped working, so had to disassemble from bottom and back to fix it. Sound improved after fix. Was hoping it would be more durable."
5,Perfect,Just the right size for a toddler. A stool would've been cute but not necessary nice the child can sit on the floor and play with it. Sound like a real piano. Has 2 octaves and includes book to teach songs. Love it.
2,Not put together,2 year old daughter receive this for Christmas...She loves it but the color key is already coming off...sounds awful...she is happy with it but I dont think it is worth the money.
5,No Mozart-but this is an amazing toddler piano!,I first tried the keys out when I received it pre-assumbled. They sound great! Its not the Grand Piano but you can definitely associate the key sounds to sound like the music listed in the book. So adorable and such a great purchase. My daughter loves to hit the keys and I love to practice my piano skills as well. Its a great learner piano to introduce your child to music.
4,Perfect Music Maker for our Toddler,"Ordered this for our 9 month old. He loves listening to his dad play guitar and we wanted a music maker for him that was truly easy and satisfying to play - he's not big enough to handle a xylophone yet, and his maracas only hold so much interest. This piano is perfect. He bangs away on it while dad plays guitar - very sweet."
5,Fun,"Bill makes science fun. This is one of my children's favorites because of a scene in which he points out that, in reality, all food comes from sunlight and dirt, and then goes to eat some dirt.All the Bill Nye videos are funny and interesting, moving quickly from one aspect of the given topic to another, and repeating the most important parts over and over without getting annoying. Some of the sections are corney or dumb, but they are aware of this and laugh at themselves, which appeals to my kids.All 4 of my children (13, 10, 6 and 3) adore the videos, and the older ones have picked up a great deal of science knowledge and understanding from the series. You can often rent them from the library, but we like them so much we have purchased them to watch over and over at home."
2,Poker,"I kept reading trying to find some story. If you really enjoy poker, maybe the description of plays might be interesting--I just skimmed over them. I suppose there was suppose to be some comparison between the game, its players, and their children, but I found it a lot of hogwash."
5,Good,"This game is a classic but not as hyped as it was in the old street fighter 2 days. This game features both first and double impact. More options such as parrying and versus modes. I was only dissapointed at one part where I set the difficulty at one star and yet the computer could get a few cheap hits on me as if it was set on 4 stars. If you want to know, I was trying to get perfects to get the shin Akuma boss. If you want more characters then get third strike. If you don't care, then get this."
3,same old when will street fighter enter a 3d realm?,This game is pretty kool but its the same thing as every other street fighter. It is better then the original arcade version.When will capcom decide to make relism graphics and 3d?
4,Old-School 2D Fighting at its Finest!,"Forget the fact that this game doesn't contain a wealth of different play modes to choose from, hundreds of unlockable characters or life-like 3D graphics. What it does have is a fighting engine that has been refined over the years, and the result is perhaps one of the best ever. If you're the sort of player who likes to simply mash buttons and watch the results, stay away. This is the sort of game that rewards skill, and defeating a veteran player takes more than dumb luck. An arcade stick will complete the experience (and is highly recommended, as the standard Dreamcast controller isn't the best match for this game.) Yes, it would be nice if there were some extras included (ala Street Fighter Alpha III), but this arcade-perfect port can stand on its own quite well."
1,Gibson propaganda,"If you know nothing about guitars and want some nice pictures (courtesy of George Gruhn), then this might be the one for you...if you can find a copy (not cuz they are sold out, but because Gibson won't release any more of them)...This book was obviously written while the author was employed at Gibson, and heavily edited by them too...there are rare pictures of rockers (who usually played other guitars) with Gibsons strapped on...the text is slanted towards Gibson throughout, I mean, it is about Gibson and published by them too..constantly making it seem like musical instrument makers are indentured servants and the companies are having this fierce war with each other, and to survive and try just to break even...and the author is constantly bashing management techniques, even Gibsons', which is irrelevant and unimportant...its way too dramatic...music and its instruments can speak for themselves..."
5,"More story George, please!","The only bad thing about ""A Hawaiian Life"" is that it's over so quick. I could have read another 1000 pages of Mr. Hakumoku's story. For any Hawaiian at heart who longs for sitting down with a true Hawaiian and talking story, this is as good as it gets. A picture window into a lifestyle so far from what some of us are living today. Sit back with inu, kick off da kine slippas and escape brah. Feel Hawaiian for a while. Mahalo nui loa George!!"
2,"Inspiring, although poorly written","It is clear that Marva Collins is very passionate about teaching, and this book is inspiring in that sense. However, it has too many cliches and many of the points made are made several times, from one chapter to the next. It provides the reader with an increasingly irritating sense of deja vu. It is rather poorly written - some sentences make no sense and the grammar is incorrect in others. It is not an easy book to get through, but can provide the reader with an inspiration for spectacular teaching."
2,Heartfelt sentiments in pedantic prose,"I am a dedicated teacher who loves to read. This book appeals to me as a teacher, but loses me as a reader. The same points are made over and over again in the first section of the book; I found myself increasingly irritated by the editing errors that abound on each page. The same quotations are repeated several times, sometimes in the span of a few pages. It reads like a collection of notes scribbled too fast.As Ms. Collins might say to one of her students, ""Nice try, but why don't we try proofreading this to make it better?"""
2,Misleading Title--Has not been updated since 1996!,"I bought this partially because the cover said ""New SAT"" on it only to find out that a) the last time this book was updated was 1996 and b) it still has a section on quantitative comparisons.It has NOT been revised for the New SAT. Having said that it does have a few shortcuts that seem worthwhile to know but I would not recommend having a student read it cover to cover. It's a shame that haven't updated the book because the concept of teaching shortcuts is worthwhile."
4,Good...still has QC stuff,Great book for kids without a lot of number sense. Kids who are very good at math will probably find most of these shortcuts intuitive. It also contains an enormous amount of material on the quantitative comparisons- which have been removed from both the PSAT and the SAT.
2,Terrible book,"This book offered 34 ""shortcuts,"" most of which are common sense. After reading this book, I took a practice test, only to find that it improved my score by 20 points (from 670-690). If you are scoring around a 500 or a 600 in the math section, then this book is for you, It my boost you score by a hundred points. But otherwise, this book will not help you. It certainly does not help the reader to ""ace"" the Math section (Waste of time and money). I reccomend some intensive preperation books such as Barrons."
4,Wilbur from Charlotte's Web,"My 8 year old daughter was reading Charlotte's Web at school. The school had a field trip to see the play. She fell in love with Wilbur and saved her money to buy it. When Wilbur arrived, I was surprised at how large and soft he was. He's very cute and my daughter just loves him!"
5,A fast-paced intriguing tale of espionage and love,"This book reads like the scenes of a good spy film. The action twists and turns, keeping your heart racing throughout. If the action isn't enough to palpitate your heart the beautiful Madison McGuire and her new found love, Terry Randall, should definitely do the trick!"
2,Not much,"A mostly forgettable bunch of new age nonsense but the numerous effects and dobro guitar make for some odd sounds you may have not heard before.""Shaman's Blues"" is a standout,but only get this thing if you find it in the cutout bin."
3,Alright season,"Good Times peaked at the end of the third season when John Amos left the show. There were still many life lessons to be learned from the Evans Family, but the show wasn't what it used to be. I bought this last season to complete the set. It's not entirely great, but it is not entirely bad either."
5,Good product for those into politics/talk radio,"I don't own one yet, but a friend demonstrated one, and it was great. See, the feature that completely blows competing products out of the water is it's built in speaker. This may or may not be important for those who just want to play hi-fidelity music, but for people into politics and talk radio it means you can have your quotes right there at the ready to prove points amongst your friends. There will be no doubt as to who said what on what show. Everybody can hear what is said together at the same time; and the internal speaker is just fine for that. With more radio shows putting out their own mp3 archives for fans, this product fills a long neglected niche market.If you want to enjoy music, simply plug in your favorite phones or amplified speakers like other models. I think other companies will soon follow buslink's lead with this one."
3,Buslink MP3 player,"We bought the Buslink 256MB MP3 player as a gift for our daughter. It was easy enough to setup because it's just like a flashdrive, it's plug and play. However, the actual MP3 player does not look as good as it appears in the webpage. It's much more thicker than what we expected. Perhaps this is because it is battery(AAA) powered. In addition, the material used for this MP3 player can use some improvement. The control buttons are a bit hard compared say to an entry level Apple iPod. On the plus side however, it has it all ... player, voice recorder, and FM radio."
2,Sort of works...,"The sound quality of the built-in speaker is pretty poor, but I didn't expect much from it. I bought this MP3 player for my 6-month old baby so she could listen to music in her car seat - it really helped relax her and put her to sleep. Unfortunately, after just a few weeks, one of the volume buttons is broken and we can't turn up the volume anymore. It also goes through batteries like crazy!"
3,Very repetitive but lots of interesting science facts,"Reading weekly chapters with my religious group. Lots of interesting science that I did not know. Its point over and over again is that the physical world is too complex for ""wisdom"" to not be involved. I think I was sold on that before this book. I have more ammunition now. However I don't think this book either proves or disproves God's existence. Probably not its point either. Maybe its point is that the scientific methods leaves a lot to be desired because it answers a lot fewer questions than people may think. But faith is still making a decision about God's existence. This book may help with this, but I think is the wrong way to get started on that."
3,"Book pales against ""Wonder of the World""","The ""Hidden Face of God"" makes its case but the subject is treated with much more breadth, depth, and articulation in ""The Wonder of the World"" by Roy Abraham Varghese. (www.tyrpublishing.com) ""Face of God"" might be a better book for those who prefer lighter reading. A tangential read is ""The End of faith,"" By Sam Harris."
3,Dr. Schroeder is in love with the universe!,"That much is abundantly clear in ""The Hidden Face of God."" Through the use of scientific explanation regarding the big bang, space-time, the 4 natural forces (gravity, electromagnetism, strong and weak nuclear) and the workings of the human body from conception to the brain-mind problem; Dr. Schroeder argues convincingly that for all the ducks to have lined up as they did to allow the formation of what we witness before us on a daily basis - just simply couldn't have happened by chance!This book is a good thorough treatise and explanation of the phrase ""God is in the details."" To pare down to the essence of this book; you will not see the boat that went by, but you'll know it was there by it's wake, or to put it another way, you'll never see the face of God but his fingerprints are all over creation.A good but not stellar (pun intended) 3 star read."
3,A mixed bag,"If you are interested in some of the details of physiology (especially human), you will find this an interesting book. But if you are interested in theology, look elsewhere: his position -- ""life is so complicated that god must have done it"" -- isn't supported by any data whatever. Nor does he offer any possible mechanism by which a deity could have influenced the evolution of life. Finally, nothing in this book offers anything useful in the way of prediction -- so there is no useful information here."
1,Most Definitely Not Science,"I read this book on recommendation by an ""opponent"" in a theological debate that claimed it had many important discoveries. This is hardly the case. It was a painful read. While Mr. Schroeder can bandy scientific terms about that will impress the average reader, it takes an astute reader to recognize that, nearly from the first sentence, he puts out his core premise which is completely unsupported.As is far too common with these sorts of tomes, the author makes great, unsupported leaps of logic, thereby invalidating their argument (as least from a scientific perspective). Add to that the citing of scripture as support for his ""findings"" and you have a book that feels good to those already in the choir. Others will look at it with a puzzled expression.This book may be whimsy or wishful thinking, but it is most assuredly not science."
3,"The creator is dead, or this is all an illusion","A couple of ways to explain this thing called life:one, the original creator--the scientist--died giving birth to life--think about it--an explosion at the lab (the ""big bang"") that kills the scientist, but that somehow preserves the chemicals he was working with--what survived the explosion mutated into this thing we call life.two, what we see, feel, touch, sense is all an illusion--reality is an illusion--the keyboard i am typing on is an illusion--this planet doesn't really exist except in our minds--we don't really create anything, touch anything, destroy anything--but we've been programmed to see these phenomena unfold. is there a logic to this--to why we are being subject to this illusion? perhaps. i find the second theory more intriguing than the first."
2,Bad judgment!,"I enjoy this band tremendously live, but they made an EXTREMELY poor decision to use keyboards on their album instead of a piano. The very cheap synthesizer sound drags everything down with it and gives every song a feeling of modern poverty row. Guys, re-record this with a genuine piano!"
1,Dumb as dirt...,"Saw this film after great anticipation, due to the recommendations of others. Unfortunately, the film's content is really aimed at 7th or 8th grade general biology or life science. Feel good stories emphasize the universality of protecting soil, nurturing it for our own survival, and ways in which soil is celebrated by people around the world. Hard science this is not."
2,Boring,I purchased this DVD (with my own money) to use for my 6th grade science classes. I was disappointed because it was boring. A waste of money!
1,gross generalization and inaccuracies,Let me start by tell you that I am a Soil Scientist. I have a B.S. in Plant and Soil Science and an M.S. in Soil and Environmental Chemistry. This is a horrible movie. It is plagued with gross generalization and inaccurate statements that border on being criminal. The movies is portrayed and a documentary on soil. It does not cover the basic components that make up soil or the factors in it creation. What this movie really is is a cinematic scare tactic on the socio-economic impacts of soil degradation.If you are looking for a documentary on what (soil) dirt is I highly recommend that you look elsewhere. This movie might be considered as a good primer on the socio-economic impacts of soil degradation. However I strongly suggest that you further research the issues so that you discover the gross generalization and inaccuracies.
4,Dirt! Review,"Dirt! The movie takes a look at the importance of dirt in sustaining human life. In this era where we think a lot about water, it is good to also be looking at our impact on dirt."
5,great movie,"I really liked this movie,after all it should be all about the dirt, it is very important to our life on this planet."
5,Dirt - The Documentary About Dirt,"Sweet documentary filled with happy earth people. Rented this from Netflix and bought it for my sister for Christmas, who is a gardener. She will love it!"
5,Do what you can do with what you have,"It is so true that all the issues of the day are overwheming. However, everyone can do something with what they have. They need to be happy with that and know it impacts the collective consciousness of our world."
4,"And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.","Based on the first part of the Divine Comedy (with nothing funny about it, at all).The story is centered around an unnerving journey through the 9 rings of Hell Dante travels to free the soul of his beloved Beatrice, damned because he broke his vow to her. In each ring of Hell he comes face to face with all of his past sins and his quest to free Beatrice also turns into a quest for personal redemption.It's horrifying, gory, tragic, and uncomfortable to watch at moments. Everything it needs to be, as Hell lives up to it's name.DO NOT LET CHILDREN SEE THIS! I can't stress enough the need to drop our bigot views on animation, just because it is not live action does not mean it is meant for children!!!"
3,Dantes Inferno,Anime was done well. Didn't get to into the story though. Def would recommend watching once.
1,che disgazia questo mi fa malata e stanza asai!!!!!!!!,"This is a travesty. I am infuriated and appalled. How can it have the same title as Dante's masterpiece?? The title is false advertising. I want my 2.99 back. This is not The Inferno,animated; this is as my title says: Una Bruta Disgrazia!!!!"
1,Terrible as the game,"how about 20 years after Dragon ball and Vampire hunter D these guys think they can just put some crappy animation to some voice overs. Its true all that matters is sales, there is no satisfaction in entertainment anymore. This cartoon is another nail in the coffin for animation and cartoons. Its boring, gory, and not every boss is shown."
1,Does Not Follow Dante's Inferno Correctly,"As a fan of Dante I excitedly ordered this film and was sorely disappointed when I began to view it. It shows Dante in a relationship with Beatrice, when that was not how the real Dante wrote this poem. Too many liberties taken to keep my interest, so I stopped it after about 10 minutes of viewing. Sorry folks, but this isn't Dante!"
3,Not Epic at All,"This is a cheesy anime type movie that I had to force myself to sit all the way through. I would say it's target audience is 11 to 15 year olds. I bought it for $5 and feel a bit cheated. I won't spoil it for you, but I will say this movie is more about showing blood and guts than telling a good story. It also is very different in a much worse way than the book Dante's Inferno which is an epic."
5,Awesome film...,I'm a fan of animated films and I also own the game and this was great to watch. As an artist myslef i loved the way the story was protrayed by different artists but kept the main storyline intact. The item arrived on time and was packaged great. If your into animated films and great stoylines i recommend you watch this.
5,"Gory, gross, horrid, but amazing.","I know some people do not like this movie. But unless they have a weak stomach, I don't understand why. The story is amazing, keeps you going the whole entire movie, AND the battle scenes are amazing. I love this movie, and for the cheap price on blue ray? Yeah, buy it."
2,Dante is rolling in his grave.,"I saw that both Mark Hamill and the animators of Ghost in the Shell were involved in this project, and so curiosity won over good sense.I should have listened to good sense.The story is stereotypical, poorly-done and shallow. The changes in animation continuity weren't really a problem, but I was not thrilled with the bastardization of one of the greatest works of our history. Unbaptized babies with knives for hands, wandering around like mindless demons? Come on! Even the medieval Catholic Church was more forgiving than that! The animation wasn't even that impressive, or eye catching. The story, if you would call it that, was more about gore and violence and beefy guys running around killing things than any kind of real nod to the classically harrowing tale of ""The Inferno"".You'd be better off actually reading ""The Inferno"", especially paired with the works of Gustave Dore."
2,poor movie,"was quite a disapointed with this movie, turn off after 25mins. think it will stay that way, generall its quite a boring show."
5,"Ambitious, but successful! Good stuff!","While at first I was skeptical about the ambitious concept of the album (setting the evolution of earth to music), after hearing the album all the way through I have to admit that Berkley does a superb job of encapsulating all 4.6 billion years of earth history in a single, hour long CD. This is not to mention that the actual music is very powerful and moving."
1,To bad it of such poor quality,"Not very high quality. You'll find that the base is made of cheap plastic and mine has a broken gear gog after four months of once a day use. Several other reviews on the web confirm the same problem. IMO another poorly designed throwaway item. Very unfortunate since my mothers loves it and has been having healthy smoothies for breakfast for the last four months, untill it broke."
4,Great little blender,"I've used mine almost daily for well over a year. The cups can be a pain to clean unless you have very small hands, and the blades are starting to dull--- but its been a good little workhorse on all the frozen smoothies, etc I've made. Also makes pretty good tapenade and nut butter spread in a useful quantity. I never get out my giant blender anymore because this is so much easier and more convenient. I feel like this thing is more well made than cheaper competitors--- who's motors would have crapped out by now."
4,Good so far,"I haven't had a chance to use very much, but so far I LOVE IT!! Will be grinding grains soon and can't wait to see how it works. So far I have done blueberries and strawberries to mix in my son's yogurt. It purees them in what seems like a millisecond!"
2,Not what I expected!,"I was very dissappointed in this product. When making salad dressings, which I make every day, large chunks of garlic remain in the container. When making smoothies pieces of ice remain in the blender. This happens regardless of how long I keep the blender on. Clean up is another issue. The container is too narrow for me to fit my hand in with a sponge to clean the edges. A bottle brush is needed. I'm going to give this away to anyone who wants it and continue my search for a better personal blender."
5,(two doors down) there' s a twangy sensation,"Since The Great Nashville Fuckup from Dwight Yoakam in 1986 (Guitars, Cadillacs Etc.Etc.) I' ve been waiting for a man & a band like Cisco. I thought The Derailers was the thougest, but I know I' ve said the same about them all... This everyday life poetry mixed with the most delicious twang guitars and the soundsof a brokenhearted broken voice, makes this album as the one I would serach for if a fire should come to my flat."
1,Young Indie.. needs lots of maturing,"Cisco's debut record seems to be just that and nothing more. An introduction. Nothing new here, or innovative for that matter. The general feeling I got while listening to this record was "" Music to snore by"". Perhaps with more years of dedicated effort Cisco may be able please a select few listeners, but for now he should stay secluded in the barn until he matures."
1,Save your money,"I have little use for buying a hard back book that is little more then an adventure module with different stories to run.I just can't see the justification in this. I never bought this book, but I looked through it at the store. It doesn't offer anything.I'd sooner buy the SAS pdf files that White Wolf offers for adventures if I have to buy a module.Not this. Go spend your money else where."
1,Bland and Dull,"I am not quite sure why one would buy this. I know this is a textbook used for university, but I would not recommend this book if you are serious about learning the discipline of business statistics.First of all, the most important reason: some of the answers in the back of the book are wrong. Have they heard of proofing? Shouldn't authors of textbooks be sending these things around for people to look at them? I mean, seriously? Didn't you guys write the questions? If you can't answer your own questions, you shouldn't write a book on math...Second, some of the book is laid out funny. I guess that is fine?If you MUST get this book. Buy the 2nd edition so you can at least have the right answers."
1,Not a Helpful Textbook,I had to buy this book for an entry-level Stats class. I had a bad teacher and looked to the book to be able to explain things. Its all gibberish! I had an A average in math for a lifetime before taking this class with this idiotic book.
5,very prompt!,"This book for my Stats class was retailed at over a hundred dollars. I got it from Red_Intl for forty bucks, and it arrived in only a few days and in great condition (the CD hadn't even been opened)!"
2,Dreadful,"This book is so terrible I cannot even begin to describe it.The format is unnatural and hard to get used to, especially if you're used to normal textbooks.It introduces a few facts, but the examples are just not very good and then it gives you problems to try out and then that format continues througout the whole chapter, making the whole learning experince very odd and uneven. I found it very hard to focus on the material because of that problem.The material is not hard to learn, if presented the right way, which this book does not do. I can't wait to sell it back.If you want to get a real understanding of statistics and actually remember some of it, I would advise you to try another book."
1,Shipping and quality are good but the book's content sucks,"I received my book in perfect condition and on time. In class, however, I found this book was difficult to use. some questions refer to examples 100 pages back an frequently have questions that you have to constantly flip back and fourth between pages. It is poorly laid out. They failed at designing this book. It barely has any examples for you to relate your question to, to have a better understanding. If your prof requests this book you should change classes immediately. The authors and publishers fail at designing this book. Other than that amazon does a great job processing your order and getting it to you on time."
2,It's plastic.,"That isn't what bothered me, though. Because the item is clearly labled as 'acrylic'. What really bothered me was the '18 gauge' label; this is not an 18 gauge. I couldn't even get it inside my piercing hole; and believe me, I tried. Hard. So hard I bled. I'd say it was a 16 gauge, at least.Body Candy Body Jewlery is usually quite decent, which is why I'm puzzled. The package arrived quickly at least."
5,Our kind of Jive,I found their music very refreshing and their presentation on a video would want to make you pay to see them....
3,an ok book,There are better vegetarian thai books out there (I also bought the one put out by the vegetarian table - liked it better). The recipes in this book just aren't that inspiring. I've recently turned vegetarian and was looking to replace old favorite cookbooks that use meats. The recipes in here seem to have just taken the old meat recipes and deleted the line that calls for meat. Well I could have done that! Other cookbooks get a bit more interesting by putting in new things like vegetables instead of the meat. This is an ok book but I'd use it more as one to augment others rather than a stand alone. One recipe that is interesting is the yellow curry with carrot. I liked that one a lot.
2,windchaser,"I received this item and three weeks later it did not work. The reset button kept going off. I contacted Amazon.com they put me in contact with the seller, I returned the item per their request. I am still waiting for a replacement which they tell me is out of stock.When the fan worked, it did a nice job."
1,Cheap piece of junk!,"Looks cheap; experienced excessive vibration when first turned on, but seemed to work OK. Next time I turned it on, it WOULD NOT operate at all. Looks like a total waste of $120.48."
1,Not well designed and I could not find a place for parts (but found many similar complaints).,"Length:: 0:51 MinsThis fan pretty much broke upon first assembly, I just didn't know it and it wasn't until recently that I looked into why. The mounting bracket attached to the rotating rod completely sheared off, disengaging the fan-head not only from the rotating shaft, but essentially leaving the entire fan-head supported on a small and bendable swing arm. I've never used the misting feature, but given that I'm lucky to get the fan-head in a position that doesn't cause the stand to fall over, I doubt I ever will."
1,dont buy,"This product is made out of cheap plastic, and the fan is made to slope down at a 30 degree angle making it only useful if u are sitting right next to it but useless from 8 feet"
1,Very poor quality.,"This fan is very poor quality. I bought it last year and the part that rotates the fan broke the second use. So the fan just droops without moving. So we used it very little. Now the electric plug makes a loud loise and the fan will only operate on low speed. No idea what caused that. I'm now afraid to use it, even if I could stand the noise, so it is garbage."
3,Biography falls short,"This biography adequately outlines the bishop's life, but has too much about it that smacks of uncritical praise. The author is insistent that almost every chapter end with the phrase ""Archbishop for the People."" It's also clear that the writer made almost no attempt to speak with those who knew the future Archbishop Hanna when he was a young man, growing up in Rochester, New York, although members of his family were still living."
4,"Fun, but all that useful?","I bought this last year as a gift, and it is very cool and high tech. It does what it says it's going to and is pretty cool to play with. However, I don't see how it is that useful, as most phones now have adequate keyboards anyway. If you needed a regular-sized keyboard for your phone, this would be fine."
5,Double bonus,"For this purchase not only do you get all the hits from an awesome band collaberated in the early 80's, but you get a handful of videos on a dvd from them also, a must have! Bill Whitt"
1,These matches are wrong on this vhs that is in another review........,These matches are not what another review said its matches from different parts the world. My friend ordered this tape and it had only about 4 matches on it and a 40 man battle royal but condenced down to 16 man battle royal its just the ending of the battle royal. Hope this helps.
2,So so...,"This WWF video release wasn't too long, nor did it have any real memorable matches on it. Sean Mooney and Lord Alfred Hayes do a horrible skit the entire video too where on other videos they are usually a great duo to laugh at."
5,Jungian and Archeological fiction,"This is an excellent and highly complex book. Anyone familiar with Jungian Psychology, Paganism and ancient mediterranean archaeology and history, will find this a fascinating read! Once again Holdstock weaves Psychology and history into a marvelous tapestry. However - if you have no knowledge of Jungian Psychology and know nothing about the ancient mediterranean or Paganism, you just might not ""get"" this book."
2,Rather boring and tedious.,"Ancient Echoes tells the story of Jack Chatwin, an Englishman from Exburgh.Jack has been having strange recurring dream-like visions, during which his body shimmers, since his teens, a phenomenon that fascinates his friend Angela. They later marry and have a daughter, Nathalie.In his visions, Jack dreams of a parallel world where two hunters, a woman and a man, are running from a deathly danger. When these ask Jack for help, Greyface threatening to harm Nathalie, Jack decides to enter a computer-monitored trance, under the supervison of Angela and her ex boy-friend Steve.Although Ancient Echoes isn't part of the series, it is nonetheless very similar in style and theme to the latest Mythago books. That is, except for a couple of passages in the middle, where Jack spends time with a prehistoric tribe and gets to meet one or two interesting characters, rather boring and tedious as a whole."
1,A disappointing read,"Ancient Echoes is one of the worst Sci Fi books that I tried to read. After 160 pages, I was absolutely bored. Earlier action had fizzled out and it was becoming clear that Jack was just dreaming the whole thing. So, I skipped ahead to page 373 and read the last 50 pages of the book. The ending was weird (as if we were exploring a mind tripping on LSD) and unsatisfying. This is my first experiance reading works by Robert Holdstock. Maybe if I had been a fan of Jungian Psychology and Paganism, then I would have enjoyed the book for its deeper meaning. But, I'm not and I didn't."
1,useless,"PC Telephony is the ""manual"" of Parity Software's VOS program and is targeted at novice PC telephony programmers. The book describe briefly several Dialogic boards that and the way VOS override C Programming. The book is interesting for those wishing to test or adopt Parity's VOS for programming their Dialogic Boards... BUT recently Parity released its new version of VOS. Spend your money on another book !"
2,A labor of love,"St. Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman was obviously a labor of love by Walter Miller. It is so densely written and so intricately plotted that it should be read with a notebook and pencil in hand along with a map of the the various locations he he describes. Although some of his characters have charm this book is not about charming people; it is about the internal politics and warmongering of a fictional future Catholic church. Although it is set in a post apocolyptic future it might just as well be set in Italy in the middle ages. Nowhere near the originality and tongue in cheeck humor of A Canticle for Leibowitz. I don't usually give up without finishing a book, but finally decided that it wasn't worth staying the course on this one. All brain and no heart."
2,Disappointing :(,"I consider A Canticle for Leibowitz the best book I've ever read. So maybe it's not surprising that the sequel was disappointing. The plot moves very slowly and often seems to go nowhere. There are detailed descriptions of events that don't seem to be of any importance. I was thoroughly confused between which warlord belonged to which clan, right up to the end. The map was helpful but insufficient. Some of the frequent references to the original seemed forced. I had to force myself to finish it. It certainly had very little of the brilliance of the original."
1,A terrible disappointment,"I hate to just sort of chime in to say I agree with the previous reviews, but, well, I agree with the previous reviews. I've read and reread CANTICLE since I was in my teens, I was thrilled to see this book at Borders, I snatched it up and, almost from the first page, realized what a terrible let-down it was going to be. Overlong, confusing, and, worst, just not very interesting. Oddly, this is the third long-delayed sequel to terrific books which I've read in the last year, all of which have proven to be disastrous: the others were Jack Finney's FROM TIME TO TIME and Carl Reiner's CONTINUE LAUGHING. I think these books are a lesson to all writers-- learn to leave well enough alone."
3,A tiresome trek through a fascinating world,"This book slowly and carefully builds up a fascinating socio-political structure for post-armageddon North America, and it's unusual and convincing in that respect. The role of organized religion portrayed in this world is the most authentic I have ever seen in SF, perhaps even more so than in the original ""Canticle for Leibowitz"" story. However, despite intelligent writing and occasional sparks of high humor, the poor plotting and characterization ultimately make it an intolerable read. I kept on through about three quarters of the book, waiting for something, anything, to make the story come together, but it remained an incoherent ramble. I would love to see a collection of short stories by other writers, using this story's setting."
2,Off track?,"This book doesn't seem to have much to do with the previous one. Yes, the monks are still there, and a Hannegan is off in the distance, but where are the philosophical bits? Why spend hundreds of pages describing the customs and mannerisms of various nomad tribes when they could be filled with the sort of writing that made Canticle famous? This work is more interesting as an insight into the author's life than as a novel, and better as a novel if one has not previously read the far better ""A Canticle for Leibowitz""."
2,Pointless and disappointing sequel to a really great book.,"I managed to wade through this sequel to ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" in the hope that the story was leading up to something that would come close to the mood and mystery of the original. However, all I got was an endlessly boring battlefield drama, with an abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion. If Mr. Miller was planning a sequel to his most excellent book, he should have written it forty years ago, when his talent was still fresh. Unfortunately, this sequel serves to diminish rather than complement his earlier work."
5,A brilliant follow up to Canticle.,"I read Canticle 30 years ago and found it one of the most provocative science fiction novels published at that time. I recommended it to like-minded enthusiasts in the UK, and generally got a positive response from them. Recently, I understood that Miller had written a sort of sequel to Canticle and eagerly awaited the publication of Wild Horse Woman in the UK. I was not at all disappointed. Whilst this cannot be considered as a true sequel to Canticle, the re-use of location, characters, and concept is truly inspiring. The convoluted yet focussed plot of this novel, together with the ""off-the-wall"" directions with which the author channels the reader produces a another masterpiece of late twentieth century science fiction writing."
1,There is no pleasure in reading this book,"I bought this book from the $5 sale table, knowing nothing of the author. It invokes confusion through increasing convolution of names, plot, characters and places, and through minutiae of description. Several times I asked myself if I could be reading something better, but doggedly pushed on to the end. Disappointingly the purpose and payoff of all the confusion and detail comes to naught. In fact the last few chapters appear to be of a different style, and while limply tying up the loose ends of the main plot simply fail to capture any spirit or tension from the prior convolution and confusion. This a 100-page idea laboured into a 400-page disappointment. As a reading experience it is a huge effort for no reward."
2,Disappointing sequel to an sf classic,"A Canticle for Leibowitz is a major classic of science fiction, one of the true must-reads of the genre. Therefore I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I found it confusing and unengaging. I had a hard time figuring out who was who (since every character seems to have two or three names) and why they were doing what they were doing. Sometimes a chapter would flash-forward to a couple of characters a few weeks later, with no explanation of the meantime. I don't know-perhaps it's just me, but I never got into it and ended up finishing it more out of duty than pleasure."
1,Bad,"This book was a poorly written sequel to Canticle, if you want something worthwhile read that. I borrowed this from a friend knowing about the first book, both he and I thought it was about Leibowitz's search for Emmma, whcih would have been more worth while"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A sequel of sorts to A Canticle for Leibowitz, but definitely not in the same class. This book is more concerned with the conflicst within the church of the time, and the conflicts in the greater political arena of what was the USA at one time.It follows one particular lower order monk who proves influential because of what he knows, and can see."
1,Terrible. A shame.,"I don't understand how the family (or the co-writer) could have allowed this book to ever come out. It shouldn't even be put at the same shelf as the ""Canticle"", one of the 10 best science-fiction books of all times. I should have believed my instinct and stopped at the first 10 pages..."
2,Many readers won't finish it is right,"Not anywhere near as good as A Canticle for Lebowitz. (Now THAT was a classic!) And why all the sexual and homosexual references? Any kid could have read Miller's first book, but this one is very much Adults Only. In addition, the 400+ pages amount to a pointlessly confusing future time. I did like the inclusion of a map, however."
2,A definite Can't Read,Impenetrable. Unconvincing. And Thoroughly misrepresented in the mainstream media by reviewers who have no appreciation for speculative fiction. Nuts.
2,what the heck?,"Well, I didn't throw this book in the trash because of what the pope called jesus{another reviewer did), frankly I don't care. I did, however, stop reading after page 30 something. This book is boring and meanders in weird directions. Also, when I picked it up I thought it would be a real sequel to Canticle(a fabulous book). I wanted to know what happened to the space faring clergy."
3,"decent for the price, but don't expect too much","This is a typical inexpensive, lightweight camera tripod. Decent for the money and serves its purpose. It is good if you're not looking to spend a lot of money and only use a tripod on an intermittent basis. I don't think it would hold up with frequent use. And do not use this when it is windy or even a slight breeze, because it will fall over every time."
3,"Pictures are old, but I still like","I thought it should of had better pictures and stuff, some of the pictures like majandras was pretty old, but anyway I liked it cause I love roswell. So if you like roswell, of course your gonna want it. ( Max and Michaels pictures are the best!)"
3,Book for beginners,"When I ordered this book I was thinking to find something that you are not able to find in PDF software manual or online help.FORGET IT! This is a good quick guide for beginners, if you are an advance users save your money..."
2,"Grainy graphics, uninspiring play","This game just wasn't very fun. It also is not much to look at. 'Iggy' is this small blob that can shoot out this 'grabber' to do stuff (kind of like Yoshi's tongue.) It's not exciting, as you rarely see any of your opponents. You move around these vaguely circular tracks by rolling Iggy - it's hard to tell he's really rolling, though. You can grab a variety of things on the track with the 'tongue', but doing so seemed pointless. This could have been a much better game than it is - but its carried out so poorly that I just couldn't get into it."
1,What?,How can people like this dumb usles wast of time game. i didn't like it very much but i guss it's entertaining to some people.
3,The Scarlet Thread,"This book was okay. Definitely not my favorite Francine Rivers book, but still a good read. It is about a woman who has to uproot herself and move away from her family because of her husband. The book talks about her struggles and inner feelings while layered with many side stories."
4,Great Book- but it didn't have the right ending!,"I love Francine River's writing style, she is a great author! I would recommend this book, but, personally, I would have written a different ending. But, this story is realistic and the characters have a fantastic depth to them. Sierra was a lovable character, and her husband made me want to wring his cheating neck! Also, Mary Kathryn was a nice addition to this book, but I found myself looking forward to going back to Sierra's side of the story. A fantastic read, my compliments to Ms. Rivers for being able to write such good Christian fiction!"
4,worth reading,"This book has a few structural problems, such as not quite enough continuity between the two parts, and a main character who is at times hard to identify with. But it was still a touching story, exploring marriage problems and the source of true fulfillment. The part about Mary Kathryn McMurray seems the best. Despite a few unrealistic idyllic pioneer scenes, Mary Kathryn's journal was a captivating read."
4,The intriguing story of two lives -- a hundred years apart.,"Rivers has penned an engaging tale of love put to the ultimate test -- and not found wanting. This was the first ""romance"" this man has read, yet both my attention and my emotions were held to the end. The Oregon Trail ""thread"" is a nice touch and vividly illustrates the ""timelessness"" of the human condition in all its beauty and ugliness. It was satisfying to see both the women of then and now grow in strength the more they leaned on God. I'm definitely going to give this one to the woman in my life."
3,"Good, not great, but good",I was kind of disappointed with this book because when I read Rivers' other books(Mark of the Lion series) I was so involved in all of the characters. In The Scarlet Thread I couldn't seem to get into it...I couldn't see eye to eye with all the characters like Rivers' other books. But if I hadn't expected something better I would definitely have enjoyed it more.
4,Loved it!,"I thank God for Francine Rivers. Her's is the best writing I have found in the Christian Fiction circuit. She has the perfect balance of romance/ suspense and drama. I really enjoyed this book and I have re-read 3 times. I liked Siera and found her to be a very ""real"" person, none of that phony, pseudo-christianity here. I liked Alex too. Flawed human bring, like the rest of us, who struggles to find his way back. These two entertained me and I laughed and I cried. Thanks Francine for creating such interesting characters. The only thing I didn't like were the journal entries, so I gave the book 4 stars."
4,Absolutely Loved it,This was one of those books that you just didn't want to put down by the time you were 75 pages into it!There was such a compassion level in the book and the characters were all very identifiable.I love a book that can make you cry with the joy of identifying with those in the book
4,A Very Good Book,"I enjoyed this book, as I have all of the other books I've read by Francine Rivers. At first I had a hard time getting involved with reading it, but once I got into the story, I ended up reading until 2 a.m. to finish it...I kept saying ""one more chapter"" until before I knew it I was finished with it. Francine has a remarkeable writing style that I truly enjoy."
3,An ok book,"The first half of the book was really good, I really liked both of the stories, but the end was pretty cheesey and I didn't love it. Worth reading, but not on my favorites list. (Mark of the Lion and Redeeming Love are much better)"
4,Hard To Put Down...,"I have read three of Francine River's books. I liked each one more than the one before. I consider myself a fan of her writing. I enjoyed the story that she told in Scarlet Thread. It was a hard book to put down because there were 2 stories entwined in one book, I had trouble deciding which story I enjoyed the most; the diary entries or the present day. I like how she deals with real problems and real pain. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and have already passed my copy on to a friend!"
3,I expected better out of Francine Rivers,I have read many of Francine Rivers books and they have been phenomenal and couldn't put them down. But this one was difficult to get through
3,Not as good as others,"Francine Rivers' other books have been much better than this one. I couldn't really identify with the main character in the beginning, and overall just wasn't really into it, while her others, like Redeeming Love and the Mark of the Lion series, I could not put down, not even to do my work!"
4,"Engrossing, real life situations - I'd recommend.","The heroine did make me want to shake her sometimes and yes, it was hard to see her forgive her far from perfect husband. Powerful forgiveness message - that no matter what - deserving or undeserving, right or wrong, we need to forgive. For ourselves first. If you didn't get it the first time, read it again."
3,Absolutely only ok,"Whie this book was not thoroughly riveting, it was also good enough to keep reading and not relegate to the bin. I found the Oregon Trail part of the story rather uninteresting and often thought of just skipping it but I was glad that I didn't as it tied in so well at the end. What can I say about Sierra? I just wanted to slap her. I felt very sorry for her husband to have such a whining wife who was never content with anything he did and only thought of her own happiness. Overall the book was a nice easy read but I don't think I'd rush out and recommend it to anyone."
4,She keeps me coming back,"This is my fourth book by Francine Rivers and as usual, it was not what I expected. I really enjoyed this story, though I thought that the journal entries would be more intertwined with the action in the present, I really enjoyed them. I did feel that the husband got off a little easy and perhaps didn't grow as much as he could have, but it was true to his personality. For him, he'd gone a long way. I would have liked to know more about some of the ladies and the club and what happened to them and if they were impacted by the main character's growing faith. All in all, it was an engaging read and kept me thinking long afterwards. That is what I love about Mrs. Rivers' books--that they draw me to pray and think."
3,Not as good as The Last Sin Eater or Voice in the Wind.,"The first book that I read by this author was Voice in the Wind. I read the whole series. I also really enjoyed The Last Sin Eater. But I didn't find this book to be as good as those, mostly because I couldn't connect with the main character (Sierra). She was so selfish it was hard to see her being the devoted mother that she was portrayed as. Then she finds God (as all main characters do in Francine Rivers books so I am not giving anything away here) and does a complete 180 becoming this unbelievably selfless person that I still couldn't relate to.I did really like the ""story within story"" that followed Mary Katherine McMurrays journey. If the whole book was about her, it would have been much better."
5,Great book,This book was fantastic. It was very captivating to have a historical life intertwined with a modern day life. The life lessons in this book make it a must read!
3,Good read,I enjoyed the interweaving of the stories of the two women. Particularly was interested in the historical details of traveling the Oregon trail and of the Indian culture. Did not think the scarlet thread of the title was played up enough though. Some might completely miss the first reference to it early in the story.
5,Excellent Christian author!,"Francine Rivers is an excellent christian author, her stories are very relatable and enlightening. Purchasing the e-book from Amazon was a very easy and smooth purchase. I will be ordering more from Amazon for this author. Thank you!"
4,good read,An excellent tale about the ins and outs of married life and how God can make a marriage what it should be. You can really relate to the characters as you see different aspects of your own life in them.
3,This book is ok....,"This book is alright. I have read all of Francine Rivers Christian fiction, and this one is not one of my favorites. I did enjoy it, but probably would not reread it, as I have so many of her other books."
5,Great author,"I have just become aware of Francine Rivers' books. Oh my, what a great author. Now I want to read them all."
3,Good Read.,"The Scarlet Thread by Francine Rivers is the story of Sierra Madrid in present day California and her ancestor Mary Kathryn McMurray during their journey across the Oregon Trail.When I first began reading this book, I really didn't like the character Sierra. I felt that she was a whiny, ungrateful, mean-spirited, selfish person. It was actually very difficult for me to get into the book because of those feelings. I am happy to say that she goes through life-changing circumstances and by the end of the book I liked the character.This book is a very good read. I especially enjoyed the excerpts from Mary Kathryn's journal on their Oregon Trail journey. I recommend reading this book. I can't say that I would read it again, but I did enjoy it and am happy to have read it."
4,Definitely recommended reading,"This novel by Francine Rivers explores the relationship between Alex and Sierra Madrid. After ten years of marriage in the small town where they both grew up, their marriage is put to the test when Alex accepts a new job in Los Angeles. Rivers does not shrink from exploring the difficult issues that face the Madrids as a result of their own choices. But she is very clear on how God redeems those choices and brings beauty from the ashes.Intertwined with the story of the Madrids is the story of Sierra's ancestor, Mary Kathryn McMurray. Mary Kathryn faced similar experiences and trials, and through reading her journal, Sierra is able to experience the love of God in a much deeper way.Overall, this was a great read with a lot of depth to the story and the characters. Definitely recommend!"
4,The Scarlet Thread Book Review,"The Scarlet Thread by Francine Rivers was a book I picked simply because of the author, Rivers never disappoints. This book is not my favorite of hers, but it has a very good story and is well written as it's about two different women's stories weaved together.The main story is about Sierra Madrid who's life changes suddenly with a move and a cheating husband while her own emotions and loss overwhelm her. This story is hard to read because it is so real and it is how life is for many people. She finds a diary by a young woman who traveled the Oregon Trail and had many trials herself with her own family. It's neat to read how the past and present can be so similar. This book is great about forgiveness.I recommend this book but if you haven't read Francine Rivers I wouldn't read this one first."
1,How disappointed was I? Let me count the ways...,"I expected a story about a woman and her grandmother, and I found instead a story about a couple who BOTH needed help. It was wonderful that Sierra found her faith, but taking back her cheating husband is absurd. He wasn't worth it!! Don't read this book if you want something touching; do read it if you like mindless drivel."
1,Disappointing to say the least,"In the beginning the story unfolds rather nicely - both of them. Until both women find God. It is very annoying to read everytime: "" Oh Lord, what should I do?"" etc.. Sierra makes stupid decisions based on forgiveness. I knew this book was going to be a romance type story but the overly christian tone towards the end got on my nerves. I finished the book just because I wanted to know how it ended but will NOT recommend it to anyone. I will never read another book by this author. Christians and believers might find it cute though..... Not for me...."
1,No depth to characters,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. There is no depth to any of the characters, it's predictable and unrealistic, it is so preachy. If you want to read the Bible but are bored by it - maybe you read this book as a modern 'storyline' but there must be better books than this out there."
4,Good book,"With the usual Rivers' style, the story becomes involved from the first page and keeps you going. Always a ""redeeming"" thread throughout."
4,Good book,"I would recommend this book to anyone. It was a little drawn out in parts, but overall it was well written and a good, encouraging read."
4,I loved this book.,"Yes, I would recommend this book. I enjoyed reading it very much. I think this book is good even if a person does not enjoy reading Christian material. I read it in one day."
5,Great Read!,I was looking for something to read that wasn't a school text book. I loved this book and the two stories that are woven together in it.
2,"Good in some ways, VERY BAD in others.","Okay, I'd like to begin by saying that I thought the story of how Sierra found her faith in God again was very touching. But, the story of she and her husband was very disappointing. I mean, sure, I believe in forgiveness, yet I also believe that repentance is equally important. Alex cheated on his wife and never really apologized or showed her that he was truly repentant for what he had done. As a matter of fact, he only went back to Sierra when he realized that Elizabeth didn't care at all about him. It didn't have to do a thing with realizing that he was really in love with his wife."
1,Junk,This product is far from OEM or even works properly. Flies off when motor is on high. I do not recommend this product
1,Below even Garfield's quality standards,"This book takes the Garfield concept out for a drive through Hollywood, and the results are mixed at best.By presenting a single continuous story, Davis has sacrificed the punchlines at the end of every few panels. The result is fewer jokes spread over more pages, and the payoff just isn't there.The entire book is in color, which was nice.The basic plot involves Jon taking Garfield and Odie to compete in a televised pet talent show, ""Pet Search."" They win a local round and travel to Hollywood to compete against the best in the nation. In the end, their act is not the best, and someone else wins. They go home. If that seems a little anticlimactic, that's because it is.Even if you love Garfield, this book is going to be a bit of a disappointment. I would buy it only after buying the other umpteen books out there."
4,Cosmically cool.,"The ""Atomic Betty"" game for the Game Boy Advance is a very nice game any way you look at it. You play as Betty and her friends from both the school and outer space. Of course, each character has his or her own special moves, so choose wisely while playing through each level. With impressive, albeit stiff, graphics and an intriguing storyline, you'll help Betty defeat the evil Maximus I.Q. and get to school on time.Not only you use impressive moves for each character you even get to play some mini games from shooting baskets to shooting asteroids and enemy spaceships. Don't forget about the final boss fight !If you are a fan of this currently unairing show, I'm sure you'll like this game. I do so, too."
4,A recommended buy,"If you are a fan of bands like Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Circus Maximus, then this is the band for you. The first few tracks are undoubtedly the best, but the rest of the album is pretty solid. It sort of trails off towards the end - 'Thriven' certainly isn't the best closer ever.Highly recommended - 'Reduced To Nothingness' is amazing."
4,A similar sound,Serenity has a sound very similar to Sonata Arctica. Any fan of Sonata Arctica will definitly appreciate the talent in this group.
2,Don't buy if you want to slice jerky.,Item works great for making cube steak. Dont waste your time and meat trying to slice jerky meat. Doesn't cut all the way through.
5,"So easy, even a child can do it!","This little package is perfect. It is so easy to use and make drab items have that sparkle you want.You set the stone where you want it on the fabric; the prongs that create the snapped in sparkle are on the wrong side of the fabric with the right side facing up. Press the handle down until you hear a click. You're done!My 9 year old pal showed me how to work it because I was busy with other things at the moment I got it out for her. The next day my costume arrived for Halloween with a loose ribbon. I connected it to the garment in seconds with a sparkling bead, added one to the other side for symmetry, and voila -- it was perfect.I have one kit and will be getting another one because it was so easy and so much fun that I'm leaving this one for my pal.Five stars -- it makes your child feel like a very successful creator."
4,Nice product.,"I love this, but with one exception. The big, black gem placer is a little flimsy. It feels like it might separate at the top of the handle when pushing down on it. It usually feels like that when placing gems through thicker fabric. All in all it is a nice product for the money, and me and my girls have been having a good time with it and doing all sorts of things."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this to make a Valentine's Day shirt for my daughter. The plunger would not spring back the way it is supposed to so each time I wanted to set another gem I had to take it apart, pull the spring apart, then put it back together and load another gem. Finally, I decided it was easier to just push the gem in by hand, and bend the prongs in with needle nose pliers. After spending two hours making the shirt, my daughter wore it once. I hand washed it, and the metal on the gems rusted onto the fabric. Ughh, nothing seems to get rust out, so it was a big waste of my time and money."
4,"Not bad, you just have to have patience and use the smaller tool!","The Gemagic machine is basically a giant stapler, with studs and fake gems as the staples. You load the machine and then press down on it.It takes patience - it works if you're willing to make sure every gem fits snugly inside the white holder (push it down ALL the way!) and then line it up with the machine's dent.I found the mini magic tool works much better than the black plunger -you can sandwich the stud better between the fabric and the plunger. Still, the prongs don't always go all the way - sometimes all except one prong sticks out, sometimes it's two, and then I manually have to press down each prong with the tool. Luckily it's fairly easy, but it's a pain.Also, I realized they can fall off if you're not careful. I bedazzled a tote bag only to find the gems near the bottom of the bag fell out after a time :(But overall it's worth it if you're willing to be patient and detailed."
1,Terrible waste of money,"Junk straight out of the box...parts break, misalign; and customer service is NO help....save yourself some time, money, and aggravation; find another suitable product."
5,Easy does it,I haven't used the GeMagic plunger yet. I've been creating my little masterpieces with the mini magic tool. This is really easy to use so far.
2,Was dissapointed,"When it holds the object to be placed it's great, but most of the time it drops out before it can be attached to material. Don't waste your money folks no need to have to get so frustrated doing a craft, it's supposed to be fun."
3,the right product poor packaging,I ordered this as a gift for the Christmas holiday. The picture showed the item and a well designed box. The item arrived in a plain brown box that was poorly taped. It looked like I was regifting!!!!
3,"manual crafts required, but end result nice","I did two items and had to flip the fabric and fold back various amounts of legs on all gems without exception. The end product was very nice though, the purse went through a wash & came out fine. The mini tool is all you really need, no worse then the big bulky thing of questionable quality."
5,REPLY TO S. Gonyo,"Seems like you are talking out of your mind because you have no clue as to what you mean.You probably purchased it from TV therefore you have had this problem. What does this have to do with purchasing from Amazon? There is no reason to trash this GREAT product because you had problem with manufacturer. Studs and rhinestones are easy to find online now. You can buy them from Amazon.com or other fine web sites. Studs were tough to find 1 month ago since they were in production at that time. This is a fairly new product and it takes time to make Rhinestones and Studs.REGARDING CREDIT CARD CHARGES: If you will order from TV, you will get trashed. All the hidden fees, Upsells etc etc. Purchase from Amazon or other fine web site which is not owned by Manufacturer and you will be in good shape and will not be surprised with hidden fees and charges."
1,This is a bunch of ...,This book is written by someone ... [who] simply makes stuff up and wants you to believe it. This author needs to get a clue. Hands down worst book about bad things on the internet.
4,A Great Eye Opener,It's about time someone prints something that provokes such thought and awareness. It has opened my eyes in the way I view things. It is obvious the author has the strong desire to reach his audience and shows no selfishness in his intent. Thank you
1,Waste of time,"If you really want to protect yourself against cybercrime, don't waste your money or time here. Get a real book that teaches you how to protect you and your family."
4,A winner from the past,This video is an outstanding value. I had forgotten shows like this existed. I watch little televison because every show is exactly alike - trash TV at its worst. This video has provided hours of family entertainment.
5,"Absolutely Wonderful, A Breath of Fresh Air","I missed the days when life was a bit easier and people were friendly and sincerely cared about each other, unlike today when most are into nothing but financial gain at any expense. These Hazel classics take me back to those days and I just love it. I agree with others that season 2 should be made available."
5,Better than I expected.,"The transfer for Hazel's first season is first rate. I have watched most of the episodes and have seen no glitches or noise spots. The audio is much better than several of the TV series of the same era that I have purchased (such as Gunsmoke, Paladin, etc). So, technically, Hazel easily gets 5 stars.This series just ordered for old time's sake. In our house in the 50s and early 60s, we watched CBS and ABC almost exclusively. I cannot recall ever watching an episode of Hazel during its first run, and I have not seen it in reruns. My first viewing of this program has been very favorable. The writing was top-notch, the adult acting was not over the top, and the plots were mostly realistic. I am pleased with season one and look forward to subsequent seasons."
4,Hazel - The Complete First Season,funny show great to see it again the kids of all age will like this
3,Hazel purchased at Amazon.com,Truly clean fun and lots of laughs. This DVD is an excellent source of a healthy dose of laughs. Buy it and you'll see!
5,Gotta Love Hazel,"I love Hazel! I was just a little kid when I watched this show in the early 70's. My mom and I would get my brother off to school and then we would sit and watch Hazel; a day could not start without our dose of this wonderful housekeeper. I wish they still made shows like this today, then maybe there wouldn't be so much violence in the world. I am glad this has been released on DVD, now I can watch it anytime I like."
5,Every home should have Hazel!,"Perfect TV viewing : HAZEL is good family values wrapped warmly in the comfort of the comedy format of sitcoms like Leave It To Beaver, Andy Griffith, and Father Knows Best. Buy it & share the fun, and the memories, with your whole family! What a treat - what a treasure - can't wait for Season 2!"
3,"Always works on one computer, but touch and go on others","This is a really good deal and I have other Kingston DataTraveler USB drives (2gb and 4gb) that always work perfectly 100%. This one (32gb) seems to be a bit less reliable. On one computer it always works. On another (identical) computer, it works 90% of the time and 10% of the time is ""unsupported."" On yet another computer, it seems to work 25% of the time.Very strange. Good deal, but not very reliable."
5,Great USB Drive,"This drive works great. It is quickly recognized by most computers I've used, is affordable, and can hold 2 GB of data."
5,excellent product,I received the product right away. I have had no problem with it at all. I works fine and very versatile if I can say that. Excellent product for a really good price. Worth it.
2,Kingston DataTraveler 2 GB,"This unit will work with XP Professional but will NOT work with XP Home Edition (XP Home does not have the driver). You can get help from Kingston, but it's so complex, it's not worth the effort. I have XP Home, so I had to give it away to someone that had XP Pro. Do NOT buy this if you have XP Home. However, the Kingston DataTraveler ONE GB unit WILL work with XP Home (I have one)."
1,"unreliable piece of crap, absolutely not for Mac","Profoundly unreliable. Sometimes is not recognized by computer, but not always. Sometimes when you plug it in, it is only read-only, and does not let you save to it. For sixty dollars, it should not work only occasionally. For the money it costs, it should be the best flash-drive ever--but it is not. (This unreliability has occurred on numerous computers, so I know the fault lies in the drive and not the assorted computers it has frustrated). If you plan to go cross-platform, and transfer back and forth from Mac to PC, this is absolutely NOT the device you want."
5,great tool,"This is my first portable driver and I am very happy. It is amazingly fast; you don't even realize how quickly files load into it.It is efficient, easy to use, it alerts you when you can remove it, and small enough to carry. It can be used so easily in other computers and files can be worked from it.If you buy one, try to get at least 2G. You can load quite a lot."
1,Too slow to be usable,"This takes forever to transfer a large number of small files. It was given as a gift but the recipient could not use it, because of this flaw. Stay away from this product!"
2,Don't Like It!,Numerous attempts to transfer media data result in system freeze-up or automatic device ejection. Probably good for simple document data.
1,copy errors,I kept getting errors when copying files from my hard drive. My other USB thumb drives work fine. I had to return this one. I lost several dollars in return penalties. I'm disappointed.
4,what a great value.,i love this one. I save what i want to save upto 2 GB. One high quality Movie also (about 1.5 GB).
3,Be Careful with the Shipping,"Guess it was my bad, but I mistakenly assumed that the $5.95 shipping applied to my entire order. I ordered two of these and was charged the ridiculous price of $11.90 for s/h. I must have been asleep when I made the commitment to buy. Obviously, the cheap price is supplemented by the outrageous shipping. Kind of like the sellers on Ebay handle it."
4,Just what I needed,"Great for our SHARED computer. I plug it in when I am on-line and files I need/want to save I save to my USB drive. Then when I'm done, simply un-plug it and I don't have to worry if someone is trying to access my files, and I don't have to worry if the files might be offensive to my roommates.Kingston Data Traveler 2 GB USB Drive (DTI/2GB)Is great for keeping my personal data safe as far as I'm concerned, plus I can take it with me and use it on any computer so visiting home, I will still have access to the files I need/want the most"
4,Review for flashdrive,"I received this product so fast...I was amazed. It is working very well for my needs, no complaints at all."
4,It works.,"First flash drive I've personally seen that allows you to stick the cap on the back while it is plugged in. I've lost several other flash drive caps, but I won't ever lose this one!"
1,"Good price, ugly and DOA","I can only comment on how this thing looks since mine never worked. The case had a bunch of scratches in it. Is this a new style, the ""used look""? I didn't particularly care for that shade of green either, but for $10 who cares right? I chucked it in the trash since it wasn't worth the effort to exchange a $10 USB flash drive.I bought a Sony MicroVault to replace this one. It works well, looks good and has a retractable USB connector so there's no cap to lose."
1,Poor quality.,Worked for about a month then it died. Wouldn't recognize in Windows. Seecond one I've had. Both poor quality. DO not buy!
4,no complaints,"pretty good flash drive, but I suggest bigger than 2 GB. 2 was large for flash drives when I bought this, but now you better go wth like a 4 or 8."
4,Excellent for storage,"Excellent for storage, just don't forget where you left the little white cap....."
5,Nice U-3,"I had just seen a few reviews of this and had never had one and thought carrying your own browser and documents and pictures in your pocket would be a good idea. I purchased this and have been using it and it works exceptionally well, plenty of storage for what I do and the price you cant beat. Very fast shipping and communication so I gave it a 5+. A satisfied customer."
2,Stopped working,"This product worked great for the first three weeks... then it wouldn't save anything. For example, I saved a few files on one computer, properly removed it, and immediately tried to open the files on another computer... but they weren't there. On the good side, the seller refunds 70% of the price."
5,As an Intel-based Macintosh boot device - fantastic!,"Works great a a normal flash device. I re-purposed it: crammed a miniaturized, bootable, version of Mac OS X Tiger ( ~= 900 MB ) on it. That leaves over 1 GB for diagnostic applications, etc. It's a R/W device too, so I can make notes, carry away logs, etc."
4,Great price,"This was a pretty good bargain lol, the price was great and works reall good. The data transfer is fast and the best is the warranty"
4,Good Product,"It provides plenty of space for my needs--documents, PDFs, slideshows, etc. It has proved to be adaptable with every computer I've tried it on so far."
5,Sweet,"Worked out of the box (Windows xp, sp2), about 8 minutes to fill it up completely, and has a flashing green light too!"
4,Excellent,"Meets my needs completely. The only snag, which may or may not be the ""fault"" of the flash drive, is that it takes some time for the computer to give the go ahead to remove it safely. I many times have had to do so before the computer did this, with no ill effects."
5,Does the Job,"I've had this jump drive for almost 2 months now, and it has worked fine. The plastic cases always concern me on these types of compenents because they are not very strong, but that is common anymore. But this drive seems to be holding up well and works flawlessly. And the price was a real bargain."
5,Aline Alves,"Fiz uma compra maravilhosa. Tudo funcionou corretamente, desde o momento da escolha (site) até a entrega. Perfeito. Eu recomendo."
4,Good buy at all standards,Great storage - plain and simple. Just plug in and store away. The price was unbelievable as looking at buying this at home is highway robbery.The only thing that would make this product perfect is some level of security to protect content.
1,SHOULD be *NO* stars,Useless product - waste of money. Does not work - causes Mac to freeze (wasn't that supposed to be a thing of the past?!?). Never was able to copy ANYTHING onto it - had to manually shut off computer. AVOID AT ALL COSTS (even this very inexpensive one)!
1,No luck on Mac,"Like another reviewer, I found the Kingston DT to be incompatible with Mac (I tried on 2 machines: a G5 and an Intel, both running 10.4.9). Out of the box, I could copy a single small file onto the USB key but when trying with larger files, it made the Finder crash (with hard-shutdown necessary). I tried to reformat but it made the Disk Utility hang during the partitioning. I know the Mac quite well and I don't give up easily but even after an hour or so of trying everything I could think of, I did not find any workaround. I shipped it back and asked Amazon to send me a new one. I just received it today: same problems. I spent more than an hour on it again and still no workaround. Maybe they had a bad batch?"
1,Frustration,"My computer gives me a prompt to reformat the drive about every other time I ""try"" to use it. I say ""try,"" because it often conks out in mid-upload, resulting in me having to start over (which of course involves reformatting the drive). What a waste of money."
3,Effective but not a daily user,"I new the issue immediately.. I could not get the plastic cap off the end of it. The end-cap, made of slick plastic, has no texture onto which to grab, so unless your fingers are wet or have other grab-enhancing attributes, pulling the end cap off is not that easy.. a no-go as a go-to-in-the-pocket drive.As others have said, its slow for small writes too.But for storing music for use in a USB enable car audio system, its just fine... small and good size. So for that, its great."
1,Dead after three months,"Everything seemed to be going fine for a while, but like others, I suddenly ended up with the dreaded request to ""format the drive,"" after which it ""failed to format,"" after which the drive was completely inaccessible -- junk. It was well taken care of, but is now completely non-functional. There are all sorts of solutions out there to manage the drive and change the drive letter; they do not work. Windows will indicate that it is plugged in, but no attempts to save it will work. Try another brand."
2,Breaks too easily.,Bought one of these in the Philippines while working there. Easily broken. I wouldn't want to rely on one of these here in the Sand Box.
1,Dead on arrival,"Ordered Jan. 15 from the Amazon merchantTadibrothers.It was dead out of the box. It lit up when inserted into the port, but Windows displayed a message that the drive was defective. I own a smaller Kingston Data Traveler and it works fine with the same computer.One further point about this merchant: the drive was advertised as new, but the plastic box came open with absolutely no effort- so I have my doubts."
5,Flash Drives are the BEST,I received the product in less than a week! the three bundle deal was a perfect choice for me and my needs!.
2,Plastic Loop Broke in 2 days,"I attached this USB drive to my company ID and lanyard. The green loop that you see on the top side (which is intended to allow you to carry the USB drive on the end of a tethering device) broke off in 2 days. It is very thin, weak plastic. Now I have to just tote the drive around in my laptop bag. Pretty low price, so I got what I paid for."
5,Kingston 2GB Pendrive,Found this product to be up to expectations. No errors to report. Great product at a reasonable price.
4,It Does Its Job,"I got This for Typing papers at my house and printing them off at school which it does what I wanted it to do, I like it"
3,kingston pen drive,"much slower than the data traveler II and even slower than the sandisk. be sure to format it if you're using a mac, it'll improve the speed, but it won't be lightning fast."
2,for about the same prices as UFD I can buy SATA II for USB,"sure HDD not pocket sized like UFD, but hitachi/seagate/wd current performance drives are about a gig for this price and are FASTER for sneakernet... and play well with my STB dvd/xvid/mp4 player.Since this was a gift.. meh. I only by lexar/corsair/OCZ high speed UFD"
1,Counterfeit memory,"I bought this memory from a vendor at Amazon. I had some issues with the memory from the beginning, but you know how it goes, I let time pass. After I finally got around contacting the vendor, they refuse to help me saying that the warranty with them had elapsed. So, I contacted Kingston. They were curious about the behavior of my memory and they asked me to sent it to them. I was counterfeit. Even the color of the stick did not match the color of their 2 GB!! (should be lime, it was purple). Kingston asked me for all the paperwork about this purchase, which I did. They in turn sent me a Real Kingston Data Traveler 2 GB USB Drive. I have not had any problems with the real flash drive."
5,"Not garbage, excellent value","I'm not sure why the one guy said his Data Taveler failed after 2 weeks (must have a virus or really crappy PC). I've had my 2 for about 2 months, and use them about everyday for MP3 storage and .NET storage. Not once have they not read or written properly. I have had no problems what so ever. These little flash drives are great, I recommend getting these versus blowing money at Walmart for the junk they sell. I may order another one very soon, to make 3."
2,Doesn't work with Portable Apps,"I bought two of these specifically to run Portable Apps, but I get errors when installing software that works on my old 64mb Lexar flash drive. The drives also locked up when I tried copying a folder with a lot of smaller files, so they apparently won't work as backup either. Reformatting didn't help, nor did trying the drives on another computer."
5,Great deal,"Fast, reliable and was definitely worth the money. I do field service computer and network support and I use this flash drive for my job everyday."
3,Questionable ReadyBoost compatibility,"I bought this DTI-2gb model for Toshiba(vista OS) laptop and it worked fine to boost the ram expansion using ReadyBoost feature from Windows Vista.So, I bought another one. This time, I ordered Kingston DTI-4gb for my other HP(Vista OS)and it did not work as ReadyBoost at all. Then I went to Kingston website only to find out that DTI models DO NOT support ReadyBoost, still misleading us with ""compatible with Vista"" print on the package. The writing speed was not as good as Memorex 4gb I already have and cheap flimsy soft plastic shell that doesn't match any of the laptop designs.If you are using it for general storage use, the other brands' products have dropped their prices to match Kingston's. Hence, it is no more bargain as the previous reviewers have mentioned.I am returning mine and will wait for Sandisk SDCZ6-4096-AC11 to come on amazon.com."
5,Great product!,I purchased this item both for easy transfer of files between computers and also for a backup of some files. It works great!
2,It's Exactly What I Bought,"It's exactly what I expected and intended on getting. But, the price was quite nice. Thanks.**** This thumb drive stopped working about a month ago - only had a one month warranty. Looks like it wasn't such as nice price after all!! ****"
5,Good flash drive,Its a flash drive drivers immediately installed on all OS had it over a year now works good no problems
4,Good but sometimes tricky,"I purchased this USB drive to replace an old, 128 MB generic one for a larger one. When I tried to copy all the files from the old USB drive to this one, I kept getting an error saying the destination drive was write-protected or full. I checked the properties of the new USB drive, and the computer would display an USB drive with zero storage capacity. I would remove it and plug it back in and problem solved until another message saying the drive was full came up. After that I had no trouble."
3,Can't work on USB hub (unless the hub is plugged to mains),"The above explains it all... Some USB hubs are not powered and this will not work when plugged-in because it draws too much power, such that devices connected to the same hub will be cut off.... USB hubs must be powered for this to work normally...It was a mistake to buy this because I needed one that will plug into an unpowered hub."
1,Stopped working after three months,I bought this flash drive to be my workhorse sneakernet device in July. It's now October and the device no longer functions at all. I cannot reliably access the drive in windows nor will it even stay registered in the drive list.What kind of flash drive fails entirely after only three months?
4,Good Pen Drive,"Well, it's a flash drive, that's it. Not the fastest, not the biggest, but it works. The price during my buying process fluctuated a lot, since they were out of stock from one store to the other, but that ok. I ended up paying 4 dollars more than the first time I saw it. I also think that this encapsulating is kind of old. It is time for something smaller and with a different design. Overall, very good."
3,It is slow,It is slow as compare to other two 32GiG USB flash I have from AData (myFlash) and Transcend (JF V60)
5,Kathy's Review,Device is doing what it's suppose to do. It's small and portable. Great product for the price.
4,"Compact, light and works fine.","Each of my two children needed a flash drive for school this year so I purchased this and the Memorex 2GB travel drive. Both are about the same price. The Kingston worked great right out of the box, is light-weight and very compact. Lanyard is not included (is with the Memorex)."
3,Not for Linux,"I've generally been wary about buying usb drives with added software - I just want a hard drive! On top of that I use Linux, so the software is even more useless.But I bought this product thinking I could wipe out all of the extra ""features"" installed with it (U3 stuff). Even though it seems to be clean, I've had nothing but problems using the drive, and I'm still unable to make it work at all with Linux, no matter how I try to format it.I guess if I didn't use Linux, it seems like it would be a nice, normal drive."
5,just what I needed,the Kingston Data Traveler is just what I was looking for... The ease by which I can have files move with me is great. mac or pc is not problem... It sure beats the days of floppy disks and burning cds!
4,"It is a USB Drive, what about it?","I guess it is an OK USB drive...I am just leaving the review so I stop receiving e-mails asking me to leave a review! It was a present for a friend so I never even saw it, I guess shipping was quick."
2,Not impressed,"I bought this to keep me from burning CD's going back and forth from work.This device is terribly slow. Compared with a Kingston 2GB CF card and a Dazzle card reader, this drive lost by 8 minutes. I also found FTP was much faster. I wanted to like it, but since my camera goes with me everywhere, the CF card is a better option. Disappointed."
4,Good Flash Drive,"The writing speed is not too fast, but the general quality is good I think. Although the price is a little bit high because a few days later I found Kingston DT 4GB only sells for 30 bucks! But anyway, it is OK.It is not small enough that I got a little trouble when I tried to plug my usb mouse in a neighboring port."
3,Need more attention,"I bought three Kinston Data Traveler 2 GB USB Drive (DTI/2GB) with the provider BlueProton..., and I received one of them damaged, up to know I dind't received help in order to solve the claim."
5,Good Flash Drive for the $$,This is a good flash drive for the price. It was perfect to take things back and forth to a class I was taking!
4,Kingston Data Travel 2 GB USB Drive,The trave data drive is great. Use it when I need to download data and take it with me. Price and shipping was great.
1,It spooks my laptop!,"This thing works fine at first. I stored a video clip, a few photos, and some MicrosoftWord documents on it. Then I started to archive my music tracks from MusicMatch program on it... Things went fine at first, then it started not really accepting the mp3 files.And then it did a really spooky thing... After I've transfered mp3 files to it and moved on to use the Internet or MicrosoftWord program with this thing still on the USB port, the cursor'd take on a life of its own. It gets draggy and seems to be stuck on left-clicking (so if I drag it across links, all the links get clicked on, opening a cascade of windows!). The only way out is to cut the power and restart the computer.... which is to say very annoying (and alarming... it's almost like being hacked in real time and the hacker hi-jacks the cursor from ya').Don't know what the heck is with it, but not using it anymore. Maybe I just got (un)lucky and drew a really rotten apple of a specimen... But then maybe not, ay?"
2,great value!,this is a great product and an excellent value. in fact my only gripe is that i put it on my keychain and it broke off. i lost it and had to buy another product specially made for keychain use to replace it.
2,A 2G USB Drive - Kingston Data Traveler is tops,"At a very competitive price, this Kingston Data Traveler USB drive comes in distinctive green and white colors that are easily recognized in a dark drawer or case. With 2G capacity it holds a lot of information, certainly enough for a whole college year. The slot at the end is for a carry string, maybe to go round your neck if you tend to lose small things. And it shows up on your computer with the word ""Kingston"" so there is instant access - no stopping to work out which drive it is using. A very useful 5 star product."
2,Inconsistent,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Let me explain the latter. It'll copy ""most"" of my files but then freeze at 10 seconds left or 5 seconds left and then error out. And then the only thing you can do is take the flash drive out and put it back in and start again. Consider that I am frustrated enough to log onto my account at Amazon and post this negative review. Stick with the Sandisk Cruzer."
5,Great Drive,"Great flash drive with a huge (for the device standard) storage size. Extremely durable and infinitely handy. If you don't have a usb flash drive, I would suggest this model for sure. I have never had a single problem with it. Perhaps the only qualm i have is that the lanyard ring is too small for key-rings. All around great purchase, though."
2,Very slow,This drive has worked perfectly (with a Mac) in every respect except that it writes and erases files extremely slowly.
4,Normal flashdrive,"for the price a great flash drive. nothing fancy about it, just does the job of a 2gig flash drive"
5,Excellent Stick Drive,"Having owned various brands of stick drives in the past, I find Kingston's longevity superior to the others and the price is decent too.Anyone using a stick drive should never put all his eggs in one basket, however---such drives CAN get lost or broken, with all your data on board. Back up its complete contents either to a folder on your desktop (which you update at least monthly), to a DVD-RW, or to another stick drive."
4,A good compromise,"Maybe it's because I'm new to kettlebell training, but I find the Kettlestack sits a bit higher, or it is ""longer"" than a standard kettlebell. When holding it in certain positions, the length of it somewhat affects the balance,or feel of it as opposed to a standard kettlebell, making it less comfortable. Also, the metal strips on the side can beat up your wristbone pretty good. That being said, the versatility of it is worth the compromise. I already had a full set of weight plates at home, so the $60 investment is worth it. Maybe not as good as the ""real thing"", but you'll still get a great workout and save a LOT of money."
5,adjustable kettlebell,Very good piece of equipment. space saving and built tough.nice addition to a home gym short on space. I will be getting another one in the future
4,Not bad at all...,"Pretty nice product. I don't have a lot of experience with ""regular"" kettlebells, so it is tough to do a direct comparison, but this set up works pretty well so far. It does seem to have the feel of regular kettlebells. I haven't gotten to really heavy weights, so can't comment on how bulky it may get with bigger weight loads. The construction is solid, but I would agree with a previous review that it seems a bit expensive for what I would think it would cost to make. It does look like it will last a while. Buying or finding standard weights is not a problem, they are fairly cheap and can be found at yard sales, craigslist, ect. Overall, as it has allowed me to start and progress through 2 levels of weights, and the money I have spent on the handle and weights is still less than what I would have spent on buying a starter bell and then having to trade up."
3,Good book for novices.,"After reading the introduction chapter, you get excited and think that this book might actually be some what different than any other hacking book on the market. It really isn't.If you have experience, the first 144 pages are a complete waste.The author provides a review of TCP/IP, Unix and NT in 144 pages.I have no doubt that the author is a seasoned professional. He even makes mention of the fact that he provides advice to the groups of authors who make the SANS security publications. Maybe he does, but this book is not written very well.If you actually read this entire book, you'll find yourselfsaying ""I've read this somewhere else"". Don't get me wrong, buy the book only if you have not read other security books. There are others that you should get before you read this one."
1,Kindle version does not have page numbers!!,I'm sure the book is good but if you are using this as a textbook it's lack of electronic page numbers is a deal breaker.
5,Very happy with this book...recommended!,"I have to give a security presentation in class soon, and this book has been a tremendous help in my studies. I didn't have any previous skill or knowledge with security/hacking. I've skimmed through a bunch of different books, but I think this book was one of the best ones that I've come across. The book seems very comprehensive, covering the whole spectrum of attacks and defenses. There's a lot of information in this book to absorb. The layout and readability were about as good as you'll find in any computer science related book.If you're just getting started like me, I think this book would be a great foundation to start with."
2,Not for Scholar or Student,"It is just a cookbook for programmer; Not a theoretical textbook for college student.If you are graduate student, please not waste your money on this book."
5,Great book overall but...,I can't argue with the fact that this is a great book to learn security. It also serves as a fantastic intro to networking with some really good insight into the interworkings of TCP/IP. One thing that is great about this book is the detail that the author goes into on each section. This should be required reading for all new security/network professionals. Its funny but the things that people take for granted that they know (foundational knowledge)are the very things that not many people in the field truly understand at a deep level. This book will help you to not be one of those people.Only one real gripe - I know typos happen and errors are common in technical books BUT... in a chapter about TCP/IP to misspell the late Jon Postel's name is just unbelievable -- Wow. (p.32)
4,Good Comic,"Great comic, very funny. If you need a comic that is funny and a good read you should check this one out. Funny characters and situations they get into."
1,Not a star!,"This book might be the first one available to deal with the (inside of the) wine business, it is definitely not a good one.Being an M.Sc. B.A. by education, a teacher of managerial accounting by profession and a wine buff, I think I am able to comment on the quality of most chapters.To begin with, there is considerable overlap between chapters when it comes to (e.g.) the discussion of the U.S. three-tier distribution system and of the financial peculiarities of the industry.More importantly, the contributing authors mostly fail to deliver new insights to the business, as you may expect from either professionals or academics in relevant fields.Somehow it gives the impression of a rush job, not well thought through and not well edited. I would not recommend it, not to interested wine enthousiasts, not to starting professionals, not to students, in short: not to any of the target groups the editors claims the book would be interesting for."
4,Lost,David was planning to just scatter his uncl's ashes (he was cramated) into the ocean but got more than that. He and the Frog get caught in an awful storm that drives them south. This was a great adventure book but was not what I expected.
1,What a load of horse manure.,"Like so many other books of its ilk, this one has less than nothing to offer. Simply looking at the flyleaf note about this new prescription for masculinity being someone who is ""skilled in the bedroom and the boardroom"" makes it clear that the 99.9% of men who will never see the inside of a boardroom will find nothing relevant to their lives between its covers. The kvetching of privileged establishment elite princesses is hardly the substance of a practical view of the difficult realities that most people face in trying to create relationships that work. The author's ""resume guys"" are the modern day prince charmings of a fairy tale being peddled as social analysis. Don't waste either your money or your time on this book. All it has to offer is stale old fantasies that have led millions to waste their lives seeking unrealistic and unworkable ideals while passing up many opportunities for realistic relationships."
1,"Same old, same old","This book has been written hundreds of times before.""Hey man, like we shouldn't get wrapped up in like whether we are MEN or WOMEN cause we are all like HUMAN BEINGS.""""So like, you know, we should like abandon all those traditional male STEREOTYPES and become more like, you know, LOVING and COMPASSIONATE.""Yes, this book has been written hundreds of times before; it has the same old recipe for total capitulation. And the fact that Michael Segall and others like him have nothing new to say shows just how UNliberating feminism really is. I don't call it very ""liberating"" that virtually everyone who has written on the subject has the same ""cookie cutter"" response to it -- it sounds more like Soviet-type journalism.Don't tell me that feminism is ""here to stay"", Mr. Segall. If you have the guts, tell me how we can triumph over it. Are you afraid of total victory? If so, WHY?"
5,Great Buy,"I bought this ""used"" book through Amazon and was very pleased with its condition. Good buy - will do it again."
2,Too difficult to read to know if any good:-(,"with all the modern fonts, the publishers chose to use a difficult to read ancient style typeface. I was intrigued by the title but couldn't get passed first few pages."
3,eh...,"All right, well I also saw the review of this CD in *Wallpaper, and was pretty impressed. So I ordered the CD here on Amazon... I listened to it really loud in my car. This music is, I suppose, technically house music, but I think its rather boring. It is good music, by all means, but its not the kind of music I would listen to just for the sake of listening. I play this CD at parties when people are talking, and if I'm driving with people in the car. It makes good, upbeat background music, but that really doesnt say a whole lot. Recapitulation: This is a good CD, but I don't think its worth the price I paid for it."
4,Jazzy fresh,To quote wallpaper ' Designed to recreate that exclusive lounge club vibe. Will delight all those who would rather commit harakiri than be seen waitin in a door queue.
2,Buy her first book instead,"Martin's first book, ""Food Pets Die For,"" is extremely useful if you really want to know what you're feeding your pet with those cheap commercial dog foods and how it may affect them negatively. (Some people may _not_ want to know, although you owe it to your companion animal(s) to find out.) This book, however, was disappointing. Much of it was common sense or, at least, common knowledge for anyone who has cared for animals and made any attempt to learn anything about their health (e.g., anti-freeze is bad, chocolate is bad, onion is bad). This book was repetitive and dull. I'd strongly recommend the first book, but skip this one unless you are just getting your first companion animal and/or don't know much about everyday dangers."
1,A poor sequel to Ann Martin's first book.,"I enjoyed Ann Martin's first book wherein she revealed the true nature of the pet food industry. More Shocking Facts rehashes some of what she wrote in her first book --- and then goes completely off track. Ms. Martin gives references to veterinarians whom she spoke to regarding the dangers of feeding a raw food diet, but doesn't let the reader know who these veterinarians are. The cat diets Ms. Martin gives in her book are way off base. I do not recommend feeding these diets to your cat. Ms. Martin should have stopped with her first book."
4,Like Wearing Cotton Candy,"After washing I was a little afraid by the amount of fuzzballs it created...laundry tip is to always zip hoodies, tie knots in hood pull-ties and wash inside out while zipped and wash in cold water. This makes fuzzball removal a breeze in the dryer and keeps the zipper from damanging other clothes. This hoodie is both light weight and fluffy. It looks much heavier than it feels, but it is perfect for cool weather. The quality is very good and it held up well to washing (following my tips). If you bought the pink like I did, you are certainly going to get noticed, so get ready. Real men wear pink!"
2,Army Veteran,I was sent the wrong color. I'm pretty sure I ordered this in black however i did receive it much sooner than anticipated but going to send it back for black.
3,melodrama,"remember when tv guide listed movies as horror, comedy, drama? this movie would be listed as etrememe melodrama roz russel and katina paxinou overact to point as comical i remember seeing the version on pbs in the 70""s with joan hackett and feeling a sense of broadway drama at its best this movie is sheer ""dynasty"" and overacted i love Roz Russell in auntie mame, his girl friday, and the trouble with angels.. my suggest is to see her in one the mentioned comedies"
1,Waste of money,"Almost 3 hours of an unintelligible dialog take all the pleasure of what appears to be an intelligent version of the theatrical piece. For this price, IMAGE should have provided at least subtitles. It has no extras, what it is not so bad after all. Don't waste your money on this issue."
2,Not For Students of the Hebrew Language,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. As I remember, it is not for in depth research. I have since given the book away, but it was useless for my purpose. Nothing like a lexicon."
3,Quite warm,These are quite warm and comfy. I got them for $3 on sale. I wouldn't pay more than that for them. They have non slip grips things on the bottom which I hate. They don't wash well (the non slip things - they always seem to stay kind of gray) They are a tad loose and do shed a bit. But they are very soft and I would buy them again for under $3 probably.
2,Never even attempted to wear.,"This nose screw needs to be sanded down. It appears it is put together from two pieces, and the junction is riddled with sharp plastic-y points. I opted not to shred my nose up in an attempt to get it in. If you have sand paper and feel like finishing the product, then it may well be worth it."
3,An odd mystery novel,"This book is sort of like a cross between a Sherlock Holmes mystery and ""Wuthering Heights"". It is told in a variety of formats (i.e. narrative, letters, diary) by different characters.The plot held my attention; however, I thought the ending was too rushed."
1,"""Make Room for Dick Van Dyke""","There is very little to criticize about any of the classic episodes of the ""Dick Van Dyke"" show, and the episodes represented here are no exception. However, out of 10 episodes on 5 tapes, only 6 are Dick Van Dyke's. The fourremaining are episodes of ""Make Room for Daddy"". This is not to say that the classic Danny Thomas shows are not enjoyable; merely that they don't belong on what is advertised as a ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" collection. In addition, the sound and picture quality of the episodes (both shows) leave much to be desired. If you're a fan of both shows and don't mind the poor quality of the recordings, then you might find this collection acceptable, but my guess is that you'd be better off taping them from conventional television reruns."
3,A Dick Van Dyke Show Fan,"This set includes some good episodes: The Night the Roof Fell In, Bank Book 6565696, Hustling the Hustler, Give Me Your Walls, A Man's Teeth are Not His Own, and Never Name A Duck. The reason I rated it as only three stars is because although there are 5 videos in this set, there are only 6 episodes of The Dick Van Dyke Show. There are also 4 episodes of a show with Danny Thomas called Life With Danny. I did not find that show very amusing, and I'm disappointed that there are almost as many of those shows as there are of The Dick Van Dyke Show, which is what I bought the set for."
1,Not what I expected either,So disappointed to find only half of the videos were devoted to the Dick Van Dyke Show and the other half to the Danny Thomas Show. The quality of the duped videos proved to be bootleg quality -- very garbled sound and blurry video. I would NOT recommend this set!
4,Four stars because this is a true classic but this set sucks,"Why can't the people responsible for putting these out put out beeter episodes, I mean the real classic ones. This show had several: the ghost in the cabin one, or the space-walnut one, or the one where Laura keeps opening Rob's mail. The one where Laura tells Alan Brady's secret on t.v. or the best, in my opinion, where Laura and Millie spend a scary night alone."
2,No illustrations,This book is for scholarly purposes only. There are no illustrations or plates of Byzantine Art within its contents.
1,"Tired, Gimmicky Building","Unusual building - yes. Good building - No. Libeskind has been something of a fad for a while now, but we've seen his stuff and it doesn't rate in the long haul. This gimmicky structure, with all its flaws and dumb theoretical ideas is really no more than a sculptural monument to Libeskind himself. I can think of no better way to dishonor the fallen Jews than this selfish and vulgar building. And when a few more years have passed, it will come to be seen as silly as a Britney Spears pop song."
1,Listed dimensions incorrect,"Generally I love Paperblank journals: the hardcover, the magnetic closure, the side pockets and the ribbon marking the page. I have tried to order this journal four times from 3 different retailers. Twice I received a Mini version, which is 3.75"" x 5.5"", and twice I received a different journal entirely - the Mozart Hunt Embellished Manuscript. The last retailer was kind enough to contact the manufacturer, which responded that this journal is only available in the mini size. Further, they're sending a Mini journal at the price of a full-sized journal. I recommend choosing a different style or format."
1,Lemon: It was pretty when I bought it....,"Bought this watch for myself 3 yr. ago for ~$75 and easily put another $120 into it in the first 9 months for repairs--because I thought it was so very pretty and needed it to work. Numbers (three of them) fell off the face, band broke, plus more. The Water Tower Clock Shop in Chi couldn't believe it either. I understand the name Gruen used to mean something good, but not anymore. I got a lemon in my opinion. Vendor was unreachable to trace any warranty--dead end. After repeated repairs in the first year it runs normally, but now the shiny gold coating is wearing off over much of the band and it just doesn't look good. This was my graduate school watch, and now I am in the market for something of higher quality. Unfortunately this was not it and isn't going much further."
5,alternador bosch,exelente yo lo recomiendo muy buena calidad es como si fuera genuino y ademas tiene un buen precio y lo envieron en tiempo y forma
4,"Rich animation, arcade gameplay lack of characters","The final wrestling game to grace the SNES took a whole different path than the previous three available. This offers arcade fighting action in and out of the ring. Arcade meaning that you press forward, forward punch to perform a move. There are only six true to life superstars, Bret Hart, the Undertaker, HBK, Razor Ramon, Doink the Clown, and Lex Luger, so you may get bored with frequent matches. There are some incredible animations though, but it does get goofy though, with hit combinations, Lex Lugers arm turning into a mace and other such odd things. There is a Road to Wrestlemania mode for single players, which pits you in singles, two on one and three on one handicap matches. It can get frustrating and tedious to go through those matches. The two player mode only has a huge battle royal mode in which a tag team together tries to defeat 12 wrestlers which come in one after another."
1,WWF Wrestlemania:The Arcade Game review,"This game is crazy. In every possible meaning of the word. I mean nothing about this game make sense. Infact I'll bet you anything,in the remotest parts of Southeast Asia,playing this game is considered the number one form of execution. The gameplay is childish & cartoony. Some of the moves in the game you can't do in real life like doing a perfect piledriver on a super-heavy-weight like Yokozuna. The game speed is so fast that you think it was high on sugar. When a wrestler punches another wrestlers,stuff comes out of that guy like when you punch Yokozuna so many times fishes fly out of his pants. All the wrestlers fly so high you think they were on speed or something like that. This makes The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon look sane by comparison. The only GOOD thing about this game is that the wreslters look like the wrestlers in real life but that's still not enough to save this game. I give this ""game"" a 1 out of 10."
3,Crayola Crayons-Oldie but Goodie,These crayons have always been great. I remember them from my childhood and it's pretty cool that I'm now buying them for my son. He of course would rather see how they taste instead of coloring with them but he does like to scribble and use a lot of different colors. He's 2 so he's learning and having fun in the process. I would say you wouldn't need more than 24 crayons to start a 2 year off on his artistic life.
5,Crayola - the BEST crayons!,"Hands down the best brand of crayons available in the market for as fr as I can remember. The quality is top notch - doesn't tear paper, doesn't flake off from the wax on paper, and colors are rich. They are cheaper here than what I paid for these at the Crayola factory."
5,Crayola Quality and Good Travel Selection,"Crayola crayons are always good ones, the sets they put together have the proper range of colors and the crayons last.This is a good travel set of crayons with 24 colors that kids can use when it is not as easy to carry the larger sets, and the associated clean-ups that are needed when getting them back into the box."
2,Broken crayons,"I just ordered the large crayons for my kindergarten class for the first time. I usually use the smaller 24 pack of crayons but find the students kept breaking them and they were too small for their hands to hold. Students had five of the large crayons roll off their tables and break the tip off in the first day of use. I was disappointed in this and now make sure they keep the crayons in the basket when not in use. Because of their weight, it must make them prone to break when dropped."
2,Motor not repairable,"If a motor part, other than switch, goes bad, you must replace complete pump unit. The motor is non-repairable.I had a motor run capacitor go bad. The part probably costs less than $5 and is simple to replace, but the capacitor is not available from the manufacturer of the pump. Their solution if one has a motor go bad-replace entire sump pump unit."
1,this game sucks,the reason this game sucks is because everybodys costumes are the same but it has CAW
1,"I would like to ""Bitch Slap"" the Author","I have read numerous books on picking up women and this one is by far the worst. At 104 pages it can only touch on subjects in a superficial manner. There is nothing about dating in it. It is about picking up and sleeping with women. If you are comfortable with lying to women to get some ""Action"" then you already know everything in this book."
1,Do not buy this book,"This book is so stupid. You wanna talk about locker room talk, well you could probably learn more in a locker room. As soon as I read the whole book (Took about 20 minutes because it's so small) I instantly threw it away. This guy is a jackass, if you buy this book I guarantee you will be disappointed. It doesn't tell you anything a normal human being doesn't already know. Basically all it says it hit on every chick you see using terrible lines that will not work. Don't waste your money. This book shouldn't even be on the market. Terrible."
3,"Could be better, but not a bad read","An entertaining read, even if the information is of limited use and really only effective on a limited audience. Utilizes well-known NLP and general influence techniques and distills the information down into an anecdotal format with the intention of making the techniques easier to absorb and understand in context. The distillation process is too thorough, however, oversimplifying and diluting what might otherwise be useful information not just for women, but for general use.The author does have an amusing sense of humor, however - the book can be read very quickly - and the basis for these techniques *is* there, you just might have to reference additional materials, or do a bit more research to get the full effect."
3,"Goofy plot, But well worth it for the Mud Wrestling action","Wild Mud Wrestling Women fight for Metal bands. The ""movie"" is dumb, but the music is OK if you are into late 80's hair bands. The best part of the video is the female mud wrestlers. The filming is good, so you get all the close up action of the beautiful Babes battling in the gooey mud! Yea baby!!!! Definately a must see for any female wrestling fan!"
3,Thunder & Mud,"If you're a fan of heavy metal music and mudwrestling, than this video is worth the price. You can see four fights and most of the girls are looking very pretty. Certainly, the fights are very short (about 2 min. each). So, most of the time you can see a few metal bands, playing and interviews with the girls. The last fight is between a very overweight woman and a small woman."
2,Not what I expected,"This film aired recently on the American Experience program on public television. Although it is listed as ""Unrated"" in Amazon's description above, it may not be appropriate for small children. There is brief nudity at about the 40 minute mark of two women gardening in the buff. It is questionable why this material was included, as it adds nothing to the film's narrative.It should also be noted that most documentaries presented on American Experience contain narration. This one is an exception and features interviews and film clips of the ""experts"" the filmmakers chose to talk to - but no narration. This film would have benefited greatly from a narrator to tie elements of the story together."
1,Don't Buy this book,"just simple fact. This book is a badly organized MFC reference.I prefer using MSDN MFC refernce to this book.If you want to learn about how MFC works try ""inside visual c++ 5.0""by David Kruglinsky ( no 6.0 version after his death) with""Programming Windows"" by Petzold ( for win 32 api and basic drawing)."
5,"For the Windows programmer, it's *the* MFC book.","Just what I was looking for. Explains the MFC concepts from the ground up in an authoritative and approachable way. The examples are perfectly pitched and bring you step-for-step through the architecture of an MFC application. What I particularly liked was how, as I was going through the examples, the book seemed to anticipate my problems and questions. You get the impression that Prosise is a Windows programmer who had to go through the process you're now going through - and he's tripped all the wires.It's not a book for programmers unfamiliar with C++, and some knowledge of how Win32 GUI programs are constructed is an advantage. However, if you're a current Windows programmer who needs to pick up MFC - it's *THE* book.(One small gripe - I would have liked more on how MFC is used with the various UDA technologies. The CRowset class for example.)"
2,NOT PRACTICAL,"Arcane and incomplete examples. A book is supposed to teach you not show you half of the solution. Definitely not for the beginner programmer. Arcaic and convulted examples. Not very realistic!!! Granted, C++ is not supposed to be easy but some of us have lifes and can't devote our life to C++..."
3,"Not Petzold, unfortunately","Unfortunately this wasn't written by the master, Petzold. However, it does an OK job, but be prepared to spend a lot of money on other books to compliment this one. I would suggest the O'reilly book Essence of C++ and the book Thinking in C++ by Bruce Eckel, plus the C++ reference from the O'Reilly series."
1,There are no legal Nude Beaches in Hawaii,"Since nude sunbathing is illegal in Hawaii, this book is a work of fiction."
2,"Fun, but one scoring piece would not work","The Pop A Shot went together well and looked great. The basketballs were of a better quality than is normally received. Unfortunately the scoring piece for one basket would not work so the ""scoring"" part of the game was not usable. Once people found out it would not keep score for both baskets they were no longer interested in playing it."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps my disappointment was my own fault for not reading the description carefully. But there's really nothing in this basket to eat other than a jar of olives and some tiny crackers.The rest of the basket is just herbs and breadmix so you can bake your own bread.It might be a nice gift for someone who likes to cook, but don't send it to anyone thinking they'd have something to nibble on."
4,Encouraging children that math can be fun!,"This is such a fantastic book that encourages children that math really can be fun! I've read it to several different classes in the past few years (K and 1st grade) and they get such a kick out of using M&M;'s as math manipulatives. They are so eager to learn, count, sort, and eat with the M&M;'s.I think it is wonderful that there are so many different skills taught within the book. Everything from counting to basic addition and subtraction. Sorting, shapes, and colors. Kids, parents and teachers can get it all in this book while learning within a fun environment!"
4,Great Addition To My Classroom,"The M&M's Counting Book is a great addition to my classroom. This book is full of color, tasty fun! I love it and so do my students. However, I will admit that I was a little disappointed that the book didn't contain the color blue; instead, it contained the M&M color tan (book was before blue became the new tan). I wasn't aware prior to the purchase that blue wasn't included therefore when the students and I were counting out the M&M's and recognizing their colors they were a little confused as to why we had blue M&M's to eat but the book said tan. Other than that, I'm very satisfied!!"
5,great book,This is a really great way to get students interested in lessons. Thanks! Book is in great shape as well.
4,M&M Math,Recieved this product in the time frame alloted. It was in good shape except for the writing on the inner cover. Very pleased with it otherwise.
2,this game is primitive at best,"I had been hunting this game down everywhere and one day I happen to find it sitting on the shelf at my favorite electronic store. I am disappointed. The game was copyrighted in 2000 and I am wondering if it's been out in Japan that long and it just took them that long to put it out in the states. The reason I say that is that it has does not meet the standards of most of todays games. It's choppy, the camera angles are all over the place and it still has to load each screen. I thought those loading days were behind us. It was very simple, more suited for younger children. I got through the first couple of stages and probably would have played through to the end but it just didn't flow well and it took too long to load. I was so anxious to get this game as I am a huge Hello Kitty collector. The graphics were pretty good and the characters were fun too. Hopefully they use her again in a better game but we'll just have to wait and see."
4,cute and fun,I love hello kitty so i bought it and i loved it. Its adorable for starters and its a lot of fun and it can be challenging at times but still a lot of fun. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves hello kitty and likes games that are not to hard and not too easy.
2,bad controls,"Wolverine's Adamantium Rage has a nice ring to it but the major problem was the controls. Worverine in this game runs around as though he is on ice, it would have been better if they set the controles to use a six button controler for all the moves wolverine has. In short the idea is great but in my opion if a game has bad controls it isn't worth playing"
5,best breakfast cookbook,I have owned this book for almost twenty years and it is a great breakfast cookbook.
5,I've worn out my first copy of cafe beaujolais,"This is my one book that i go to again, and again and again. Everything in it from Chinese Chicken Salad to Mom's Banana Cake is scrumptious. It's hard to say what is my favorite - I guess they all are. You are missing out if you don't have this book. You won't be sorry; not to mention that simple instructions, simple ingredients, wonderful for the novice cook and then some. ENJOY!"
5,A Refreshing CD In The Plague of Doom/Drone/Sludge Metal,"This CD breaks away from all the stereotypes placed by bands such as Sunn O))), Isis, Neurosis, Pelican, etc. (doom or drone). Instead of constantly being plunged into dark ambient heaviness, they lighten it up occasionally and even, OHMYGOSH, speed it up a bit. It's a refreshing change.Please note that this CD is quite different than their more metalcore mixed with screamo past releases.The lyrics are phenomenal and ridiculously intelligent. Simply amazing. The lyrics reflect the epic and intense feeling of the CD. A reflection of our society, perfect social commentary.Time As Imperialism shows their vast influences, and the beauty that they can create.An amazing CD."
3,"Pretty good, if not completely original","If you are fans of bands such as Neurosis and their offsping in Isis, Old Man Gloom and Pelican, then you can expect a very similar product from Canada's Buried Inside. The problem is wall-of-sound drone is often done better by the aforementioned bands, namely Isis. Still, Buried Inside manage to put their own spin on things and blend their droning heavy and melodic parts with faster metallic hardcore in a way that is professionally executed.Despite their woefully generic name and their slight lack of originality, Buried Inside are far superior to the current crop of irritating emo-influenced crap and wannabe Swedish metalcore."
5,Great Swing music by a master.,Gene Krupa was the star drummer of the Swing Era and led his own band.All the songs a well played.Quick delivery.
4,the handbook you cant put down,"i found this book to be helpful in understanding how the torqueflite works. from a basic rebuild to race performance upgrades this book covers it all. if you have little, or no understanding of how an automatic trans works and are looking to rebuild your trans to handle a high performance engine, you will want to re-read several chapters."
5,Chrysler books,I bought these books for my brother for Christmas and he couldn't wait to tie into them. He loved them! Thanks!
2,Basic Text,This is a reasonable introduction to the Torqueflite tranny. After reading I still wouldn't be comfortable rebuilding one.
3,Not a Rebuild Manual,"This book is OK for the info but do not confuse it with a step-by-step guide to rebuld your stock trans. It has no index and the emphasis is on racing applications ('Cuda funny cars on the cover installation). There are so many variations through the years; it can't give you much specific info (the book states this repeatedly). It is hardly the ""master reference"" it claims to be."
3,A Challenge to Read,"If you enjoy relaxing with an informative and entertaining biolography, this is not the book for you. The thematic presentation and frequent reference to other works, both recent and ancient make this a study of Alexander with the emphasis on ""study"". Almost every page required referrals to the Timeline, the Maps, the ""Dramatis Personae"", and the Glossary. I found myself having to work through parts of the book as I would a text book. In other words, its too much like schoolwork! I do have to concede that Cartledge is extremely knowledgable on the subject and, as the book jacket suggest, may well be ""our leading expert on the subject of Sparta and ancient Greece.""If you are really into the history of this era and already have a fair knowledge of Alexander and the politics of his time, you will enjoy. As for myself, I prefer the ""lay person"", chronological styles of history writers such as David McCollough and Stephen Ambrose."
1,Pale man projected,"I do know or have read a lot about Alexander and once Cartledge has decided, which he has, despite protesting in a very Phd fashion he hasn't, decided Alexander was involved in orchestrating his father's murder, it's a quick down hill run.The analysis of motivation now is totally predictable and rehashes what a handful of other authors have said without the pretence of extraordinary intro. This kind of work can be done on every extraordinary human right thru Che Guevara and MLK Jr. Seems much more a projection by an academic on a man of action. And avoids the one massive truth we do know about the man: Philip's mission was to free the Ionian coast, that was what the men signed on for. Instead they went to India. Something, someone compelled a very rough, tough single minded bunch of Macedonians to fight and to follow. As an academic involved in the endeavor of persuasion this must surely be a daunting competitor to measure against."
2,Difficult to follow and repetitive,"I was looking for a book that provided some continuity of Alexanders life and a bit of story line regarding how his life unfolded. The hype on the back cover of this book was that it was exhilarating, thrilling and invincible. This led me to believe that it was more than just a book about the events, people and places in Alexanders life. If you are looking for a book to engage you and keep your attention then I don't recommend this book. However it is chock full of information and references so if that's what you need then by all means give it a go."
5,Excellent scholarly analysis for the reader that already has a working knowledge of Alexander's life,"I should state from the outset that this book is probably not the best choice for someone who has not previously studied the life of Alexander the Great (or watched one of the better documentaries available). The book is a topic based biography and would be a bit difficult to fully appreciate without already knowing the basic biography of Alexander the Great. With that being said this is a superb in depth analysis of the life of Alexander the Great divided into a number of topical essays. Granted, the topic based biography leads to some repetition but Cartledge manages to repeat facts just enough to strengthen the readability of the book without losing the reader's interest. Cartledge succeeds in a difficult task - providing in depth scholarly analysis that is also enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a more in depth understanding of the history of Alexander the Great."
2,Not really for laypeople,"The thematic as opposed to chronological presentation makes this book of limited interest to a layperson. The average reader is probably not that interested in an entire chapter on whether Alexander thought he was a God or not.There is a tendency towards redundancy in the language used within each sentence and redundancy in the arguments used, which impedes the flow of the reading. I have a feeling the publisher asked for a larger book, and this was the result.I would have preferred deeper, even if speculative, discussion about Alexander's psychological makeup.You know a book is probably in trouble when 80% of the back-cover blurbs are about a previous book of the author's, and the one blurb about this book is from a fellow historian instead of an independent entity."
1,Fragmented read,"The book reads unorganized, missing key information I am most interested in (battles). For lack of story telling the author made up by supplementing disjointed personal opinions. Overall a poor read. There are many better alternatives on this subject."
3,A great idea but needs refinement,"Sing Japanese is a tape and small book that allows the reader/learner to sing popular Japanese pop songs inorder to learn new vocabulary, practice listening skills and a few grammer points. This is a great and new concept for learning any foreign language. One drawback would be with the tape itself. The cassete tape has been recorded (or mixed) poorly making it very hard to hear the singers voice above the music; the very reason for having the tape. In addition, the music was recorded by cover bands - it would have been nice to hear the original artist and the original recording; maybe the quality would have been improved. I would be interested in having a Sing Japanese II with additional songs."
5,Another Winner,"I purchased one of these for my 9mm and came back for another one for my .45 ACP. These do a great bore cleaning job along with some solvent, patches and a bore jag."
5,Works perfectly.,"Perfect size, exactly what I needed. Will buy again when I wear this one out (which will probably take quite a while.)."
4,A superior Lubricant,"I use this product because my diesel Jeep calls for it specifically. I run this oil 15,000km between changes and regularly have the used oil tested at a reliable lab. It always shows low engine wear and good lubricating qualities at the end of change periods. The lab usually reports that I could run it longer tan I do!The bad part - It is expensive.John@JcGilmour.ca"
5,Best Synthetic Motor Oil,This oil is simply amazing. it improves acceleration and saves gas at the same time. I am recommending it to everyone i know.
4,Great product - better prices available locally if you look,"This is great oil - there's no debating that. Compared to normal prices in auto stores, this is a good deal as it gets the oil to your door for less than retail's 7.99 or so/quart. That said, autozone and pep boys currently both have - and regularly have deals of 5 quarts plus a mobil 1 filter for $31...you do the math ;)"
5,mobil do they make royal purple???,Mobil makes many other oils but the Synthetic 0-40 covers the best specs of all engines for almost all climates.I drive a audi TT turbo high performance car I have always used Valv. and it is a good oil but this can take the punishment I give the engineand bottom line if you think it works that is all that counts.
3,Independent Lab specs would be nice,My honda has 343k miles/ Primarily have used Mobile 1... Have searched everywhere & have been unable to find independent lab analysis for various brands of synthetics. The internet is flooded with Amsoil lab specs but i do not trust the results. Anyone know of lab analysis truly independent?
4,Best for Audi,"I used this in my 2006 B7 Audi A4 instead of the 5w40 or 0w30 due to climate and mileage, but you cannot go wrong with this synthetic. The one thing I would seriously consider is checking out your local auto-store, though. I found a 5QT of this exact oil for cheaper than the 6-pack (comparatively per QT). Other than the price difference, the product itself is exactly what it claims to be. Can't go wrong with it."
1,"CAN work, if your stomach is a bottom-less pit..","I read GROW! cover to cover in less than an hour, sitting in my local bookstore. It didn't take long for me to realize that the recommended caloric intake the author recommends for this program is absurd. The workout routine seems half-way decent, but the diet? You've got to be kidding me. A 200 lb. individual, looking to pack on some size would have to eat about 6,000 calories per day on this program to follow it to the T. Anyone who is 200 lbs. and can eat 6,000 calories on a daily basis deserves a hearty handshake, pat on the pack, and a test for intestinal worms, which might be sucking the nutrients right out of you. It's not logical to follow this type of program. You will feel sluggish, bloated, and will get fat from force feeding your body in this manner.This is hands down the worst book on bodybuilding I have ever read."
1,could have more information,"This book does get straight to the piont, but it only tells you want you need to know for just that 28 days. If you plan on lifting weights for only 28 days go ahead,and buy this book. If you plan on lifting for longer that the book that I would choose if I was you would be Bodybuilding by Joe Weider."
3,Behind the Scenes at the Bush White House,"John Podhoretz has written a good account of the Bush White House, from his perspectifve as a junior level staffer. An entertaining look at the decline and fall of a one-term President."
1,Culture wars,This was supposed to be an insider's view of the Bush administration. But the only way the author could get near the White House was with a visitor's pass. So we get second-hand bile passed off as the real deal.
1,Podhoretz Jr. a chip off the old block,"His old man, Norman Podhoretz, is nothing but an intellectual thug, and his son has not strayed far from the trunk of this polluted tree. I would shun all Podhoretzes -- including the mom, Midge Decter. Perhaps we can send them back to Galicia."
5,Cruisin' 1964,"To the person who was shocked that there was a news bulletin about an armed robbery while the music played...You must be too young to remember ""real radio"". That is the beauty of the Cruisin' series - you get to hear the innocense, the newness of pop radio and rock 'n' roll. What you hear on this (and other CDs in the series) is what radio of the 50's and 60's was like. Yes, they talked over the intro but they played the entire song - they didn't cut if off 15 seconds from the end! You can't find radio like this anymore! Look at the mixture of songs on this CD - they are from many genre.If you listend to Top 40 radio in the 50's or 60's this is the series to get. You can't explain to anyone what Top 40 radio was like in those times; you have to hear it. This is great! Now my kids know what real radio sounded like. The series is all good!"
1,The Author is Dillusional,"He attempts to state, that the Quran is perfect. Then he makes the claim that there should be certain adjustments made. There are no versions of the Quran, it has remained as one book for around 1500 years! He makes adjustments in order for his mathematical calculations to work out, and so that he can prove that he is a messenger from GOD! Although I am a Muslim, I think he makes no sense what so ever, and he is only doing this to spread the incorrect notion that he is some sort of messenger from God."
1,Not even close!,"The author is counting the number of arabic letters in the expression ""in the name of God the most Gracious the Most Merciful"" that precedes most chapters in the Quran. Then he claims to be the new messenger of God! Then he turns back and says that the Quran is Corrupted! now that's a dishonest intention and some very poor logic!!."
3,Good re-creation of radio days but not good music source,"An interesting format, a slice of 1957 radio. Unfortunately, that includes some scratches/blips in the music from the old vinyl records. There is also some deejay talking into or right up to the music. These are things to consider if you want to rip the music.FYI: I've been a record collector and sometimes deejay for 50 years."
3,A vast ethno-folk-chamber-pop experiment,"A ten-year veteran of the Providence, RI scene, Redfearn uses his Eyesores as something of a vast ethno-folk-chamber-pop experiment. Sorry for all those hyphens, let me explain: ethno = unusual, vaguely eastern european melodies and chord progressions; folk = largely acoustic and folk instruments (violins, woodwinds, horns, accordions, hurdy-gurdy) tho some electronic treatments of same; chamber-pop = intimate arrangements of loosely pop song structures but definitely not rockin'. (Think Rachel's.) It's all almost as if some future ethnomusicologist came back to a time and place not unlike our own to make field recordings or, in the spirit of Can's ""Ethnomusicological Forgery Series,"" faked it. All very interesting even if it not thoroughly captivating."
4,Not Bad,"I bought this book for my nephew who has been reading this series with great delight and this time I also joined in on the reading. It wasn't bad-better then alot of the extended universe books (not that that is very hard to do). The material is reasonably appropriate for older children (i.e. violence level is about that of the films and all sexual content is kept low key except all the female characters a drwan a bit on the sleezy side).The plot is a bit lame but my hopes were not set on that anyway so I had alot of fun with it. It was good to see old faces, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Liea (who does not look much like the Liea I remember form the films) as well as the usual X Wing crowd. Another reason I liked this one is the character of Winter is more then just a useful babysitter for the Solo kids as is common in the extended universe. For the hard core Star Wars fans I am sure this one will be enjoyable and worth aquiring."
4,Eye opener,"Unlike other technical analysis books, which focus on head-and-shoulders and other patterns and simple things like moving averages, DeMark's ""New Science"" book provides the reader two valuable things: 1) ready-to-implement technical indicators that can be programmed (assuming you have access to the necessary data), and 2) ideas for further research. My personal experience is that I haven't made any money using his indicators. For example, the Sequential indicator used to work but after the Internet bubble I've lost money with this indicator. But it did give me some ideas and made me look beyond things like double bottom which are even less reliable, not to mention difficult to implement.If you are into trading system building and/or using formulas to create indicators, this is a must-read."
2,DeMark methods may not be very profitable!!,"I always want to learn new technical indicators. So I was very exciting to know DeMark created so many of them. Some of them were quite creative. But I found he did not explain his methods in detail. It seems you need to just take his words. The most important question is whether they are useful for trading. I know some people in a website created a number of trading systems based upon his methods. Most of them are not very profitable. After many tests, I think I will not use any of them in trading! Sigh!"
4,Practical Technical Analysis,"This is not easy reading, but for the person who takes the time to understand the systems DeMark introduces, it is valuable. The reader should have some knowledge of technical analysis. DeMark gives detailed instructions on how to apply systems he has spend years developing. The strength is that his system is not trend following but designed to spot tops and bottoms of markets. I am not sure this book is necessary if you plan on purchasing his subsequent book, ""New Market Timing Techniques."""
5,The writer is a market genius!,"Prior to xmas and on my birthday I received a copy of DeMark's 'New Science of Technical Analysis'. I have been a professional trader for over 20 years and currently head up the trading operation at one of the major Wall Street firms. I thought I knew how market operateed and I shared my expereince on TV, radio, and in newspapers for years. Upon reading this book and as well ass the other two in the DeMark set, I have gained a profound new awareness how markets truly behave. The author is beyoind peer in defining and describing the intricacies of price behavior. What an enlightening series of reads."
1,The new science od technical analysis,This book is written in a difficult way to understand. I have read over a 100 books on the market and this one doesn't explain how he arrives at conclusions.Roger
1,If this book helps your trading then you aren't trading properly to begin with,"1. The language doesn't match the examples.2. Trend lines aren't that big a deal to begin with; they're a tool, learn to read price instead.3. Verbose - Could have been put in five pages.4. Author appears to have ego tied to ideas. Tom Demark Trend lines? Please.5. It's just plain cumbersome (the book,) not advanced, cumbersome."
5,"Nice, comfy and excellent deal!","I love the squishiness of the microbead pillow! This is a great deal at 10$ too! I wish Amazon would write what their shipping is per item, b/c come to find out it was aroud 8$ which is a bit steep, but still will get lots of use!"
4,TRAVEL PILLOW,Very comfortable-stays cool. I sleep with it every night as well as for travel for good neck support. One problem the filling burst out and I had to sew it but I really use it a lot. I have two so I can have one for travel and one for home use.
1,Pillow Doctor Needs Stitching,We used the pillow doctor once and the seam ripped resulting in a huge mess all over the car.
4,Seattle Radio Legend Pat O'Day preserved,"Growing up in the Greater Puget Sound area in the 1960's & 1970's, Seattle Radio was at its best, and KJR was THE Number One station. I knew when I was 10 years old that I wanted to become a Disc Jockey and I wanted to work for KJR. I don't know how many people get to live their dreams, but I was just lucky I guess. Pat O'Day was one of my heroes, and I was lucky enough to work for KJR in the 1970's. After I gruadated out of broadcasting school in 1985, I was hired by Pat O'Day to work mornings at KXA... a childhood dream come true. I Thank Mr. O'Day for the opportunity I was given. Those were the best days of my life, and something I will never forget. To those of you who grew up in the Seattle area and hear Pat O'Day will appreciate and enjoy this ""Aircheck"" CD, and bring back many great memories of days gone by. Enjoy and Stay 2nd :-)"
3,Not perfect but gets the job done,"I'm late writing a review as I bought this unit over a year ago.There are other media players out there but none have the functionality of the Helios. Yes it has allot of bugs but I love this unit, once you learn to get around them it does what it was meant to do.If you want to play media in 720,1080,1080p or just about any format, this unit will do it. The video quality is superb, audio is also very good.It's too bad it was discontinued and no longer any support. Some newer video formats like Matroska (.mkv)are not supported.I'm sure that threats from the motion picture industry and potential copyright infringement lawsuits stopped them from supporting updates.It's too bad because firmware updates would have made this a superior unit."
5,Excellent advice during a crisis,I picked up a copy of this book at my local library when my Dad became suddenly ill and shortly after passed away. There is advise in this book for both dealing with the crisis of a loved one passing and the aftermath. I found the information very valuable and useful; so much so that I ordered copies from Amazon to send to other members of my family.
4,A Good Primer on the Issue of Gun Ownership,"This book is a good read, easy to follow and concise about its arguments. For someone new to the gun control debate the basics of the argument can be learned in this book. Its main flaw is that its somewhat incomplete by academic standards. For example I found some quotes attributed to founding father George Mason about the issue of firearms at the Cal State Hayward library. The quote was correct and in context, and supported LaPierre's thesis, but it was not exactly where the endnotes said it could be found. But, to be fair, the book is not intended for academics. Mr. La Pierre wrote it for the general population to convey a point of view without the usual interference from critics of gun rights. So buy the book to see what its all about; to learn something and read what you would never see in the media. Just don't take it as the final word on gun control. Its too basic. Use it as a launch point to do your own research."
5,A most wonderful surprise!,"If you want to explore the riches of the New World during the Baroque Period start here. What a marvelous Mass this is, and the performance is excellent."
3,"Overall, not bad","Overall, for the price, this product was good. The value for the price definitely is what tips the scale. It was relatively easy to mount, and it works fairly well. It's not the most stable platform I've ever seen, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone who does a tremendous amount of typing. But it's far from the most flimsy I've seen! If there was any major complaint, it would be the position of the handle used to lock it into position (or unlock it). If you plan to raise this platform above the level of its ""runner"" for use and then lower it before pushing it back under the desk, that could be an issue (which makes you have to bend and reach a little to get to the handle)."
1,Poor Choice... Keep Looking,"If you are looking for a quality keyboard tray, keep looking! Although I was pleased that the support bar and articulating arm were metal, the tray itself is plastic. Its a fairly sturdy plastic, however the tray bounces up and down when you attempt to type. DO NOT PAY more than $30 for this thing, you'd be better off making one yourself! I'm currently trying to return this item to the seller (not Amazon), and I'm having difficulty getting my money back. I certainly don't want a replacement issued, I don't want it at all! Definitely keep looking for a higher quality keyboard tray... Kensington has some nicer (more expensive) trays, but after this one, I'm leery to buy a tray from them again. My advice would be to look at the Bush articulating keyboard tray... still on the ""expensive"" side, but appears to be of better quality."
1,Bounces when you type. Quit using it almost immediately.,"Looks great. Nice & big. Bounces with each and every keystroke. Bought two--both of us quit using it within a couple of weeks. It's just not sturdy since it's only attached at one point, which is in the middle."
3,"Does what it looks like, good value","This was easy to assemble and install and the multi-axis adjustment means I have my keyboard at exactly the height and angle I like. My wrists love it. The only negative is that while it feels like a solid product, there's a bit of play in the slider so the keyboard tray can move around by about 12mm."
1,Missing pieces,"All the hardware is missing for this item. How the hell am I supposed to put it together? Now I have to go find all the differnet sized screws, spend more money and waste time."
1,Tray will not angle,"after putting the tray together, to attach to the desk, it would not angle down like the picture. It only went in straight so it did not fit what I needed. pretty flimsy if you used all three panels."
1,"Flimsy, breaks easily",I have gone through 2 plastic Kensington keyboard trays in as many months! Not only do the screws fall out (I just read that using super glue will help this) but the screw sleeves on the tray are plastic and just crumble apart. Terrible product. And what a pain to have to remount another one after already having this thing attached to the underside of the desk--- do it right the first time and buy a different brand!
3,"Fine tray, very little negative tilt","This is a nice, wide keyboard tray (30.5"" when all three panels are used). No problems with installation, although the template for drilling holes doesn't have an indication as to which direction the front of the desk should be (if you accidentally do it backwards, you can just insert the arm from the back instead of the front). I don't have problems with bouncing or flexing. (If I did, I'd just go out and get a 30"" piece of wood instead of the plastic panels and screw that on instead).However, the keyboard doesn't do negative tilt properly. You can get about two degrees negative tilt (the way trays are supposed to work, with the back of the keyboard lower than the front) and about 15 degrees positive tilt (that is, the front of the keyboard is lower than the front). I'm still debating whether to send it back or not. Three stars for inaccurate product description, otherwise a fine product."
4,Overall Good Product,"Easy installation.Plastic keyboard/mouse tray.Foam wrist pad for keyboard does not adhere to keyboard tray and is a little larger than the slot that is cut in the tray.Metal bar that is attached to bottom of tray during installation. If you are using the extra plastic tray extension for your mouse be aware that the tray can be sensitive to pressure as the metal bar does not extend across the entire length of the tray.Overall I have been pleased with this product. When using the mouse you just don't want to put much pressure on the tray. It doesn't feel like it will break, just bends down a little."
2,keyboard platform is not stable,I was expecting this keyboard tray to be more adjustable and not so flimsy. I am still getting used to it but so far I am not very pleased with its performance.
3,so-so,"The book was okay but I would have probably enjoyed some photographs or illustrations, or something to break up the writing. I just ended up giving it to a friend."
4,This is a very interesting book about the different ways to massage the muscles of your dogs,"This is a very interesting book about the different ways to massage the muscles of your dogs. Learn which muscles are connected to what and how to massage them in what direction. Excellent for the lay person to learn and do a professional type of massage on their own dogs. Just remember once you have learned, they will want you to take the time to do it every day."
3,More than you need to know,"This book could have been shortened by half and not lost a thing. The various massage techniques could use added depth, and graphics could be enhanced to assist the layman (and that's who we are) to effectively massage our dogs. If you have experienced a massage personally then you will have a better idea of what the good doctor means in his technique descriptions. If not, I think I would probably check out youtube to improve my ability to do it right. Overall, this isn't a bad book; it is just overly long winded. Start reading at page 60 and then jump back to the brief massage descriptions earlier on."
3,Good for those with no knowledge of canine massage,"I read this book through quickly. It's an easy read, but does not tell you anything new if you are familiar with massage. This is a great book for someone who wants to help and achy, or aging pet, and doesn't know where to start. Since purchasing, I have given the book to someone who was able to leran from and use the book. For the price, if you want to reinforce what you already know or just be sure you are using the right massage techniques, it's worth it."
2,did she get paid by the word?,"i've never read a book with so much banal chit-chat! the dialogue was just plain bad. the book could have been about 200 pages shorter and maybe i'd have been able to get through it. as it was, half way through , i realy didn't care who killed who!"
4,iCarly,i save your life is a good episode about how freddie saves carly from being hit by a truck and how sam and spencer are in a paintball-thing war. but carly wears an immodest dress and she and freddie kiss like threee times. but bedies that it is pretty good.
4,Contains 4 Previously Unreleased Episodes,"This DVD set is good, but you can find 2 of this DVD's 6 episodes on theiCarly: Season Two, Volume TwoDVD set.This set contains the following episodes:iSaved Your Life [Extended Director's Cut]iQuit iCarly, Parts 1 & 2iThink They KissediTwinsiMove OutOf those 6 episodes, 'iThink They Kissed' and 'iTwins' can be found on the Season 2, Volume 2 set. If you haven't already purchased this DVD, then the Season 2, Volume 2 set might be the way to go."
5,Best Way To Start,"The grammar books in the ""Teach Yourself"" series are outstanding. They start from the very basics and work through all the grammar you would learn in several years of courses. In fact, you may want to use this book before a general course, as it sets the basis for learning the language and includes a fair amount of vocabulary and such anyway."
2,Literary Device is Needlessly Confusing,"The narrator is writing to a friend, relating a story that author Joseph Conrad had related to him earlier, about an encounter at sea. Got it? Lawrence Thornton's literary device is certainly clever, but it's so complicated that the whole book collapses under its weight. The dust jacket gave the impression that this book had similarities to ""The Caine Mutiny,"" but that's not at all the case.Thornton's premise is interesting and his descriptive writing is excellent, but this was not an enjoyable read for me. A knowledge and love of Joseph Conrad's novels is practically essential, as is the patience for sorting out Thornton's narrative."
5,THANK YOU DR. DYSON!!,"Dr. Dyson is a serious intellectual, but one who is ""down-to-earth"", and who can identify and relate to everyone whether you are as highly educated, working class-- whoever. Dr. Dyson continues to give props to his race, and especially to black women who are often misunderstood, stereotyped, and unacknowledged. He no doubt loves, respects, appreciates, and worships black women. He never fails to use his intelligence and gifts to showcase the black woman. His columns and writings always bring about serious dialogue between the sexes and races. Thank you Dr. Dyson for letting black women shine!!"
5,Fantastic!,"This book was outstanding. Finally, a sensitive and thoughtful black man pays public tribute to the pain and beauty of black womanhood. In a society that is bent at all costs to defemenise and destroy black women and to see her as less then lovely and portrays her in a negative light, Dyson honors our pain and beauty. I wish that more people not just black men and women could understand the painful hole this society has dumped black women in. And, to the narrow small minded pinhead man, who wrote the no thanks review, (see above) he obviously hates black women and is insensitive to their pain and suffering. His comments deserve NO attention at all and perhaps he could use his time more wizely flipping through the cable channel and watching the O'Riley Factor. Please read this book, if you want to understand more black women."
1,"What if I put out a book called, ""Why I Hate Black Women""?","Sick of the double standard...it's okay to generalize and say ""Black women are the best!"" or ""Hispanics are such a warm, happy, productive people!"" or ""Germans are so hard working"" or ""The Italians love to laugh"" etc. etc. But it's a racist-motivated generalization to say (by way of example only--I am not driven by any of these generalizations) something like: ""Blacks are violent"" or ""Mexicans are lazy"" or ""white people can't dance"" or ""Trailer-trash"" this or that, or ""white trash"" this or that, etc. etc."
1,No thanks.,"Much is made of dyson's intellectual prowess; this just goes to show you that all things are relative. There are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson's intellect would, one assumes, seem impressive. But that don't necessarily make it so. You may, at some point, have heard the term pinhead. The term signifies that the owner of such a head has a tiny little brain, a ""peabrain"" if you will. This, in a nutshell, is dyson. He meanders around offering weak commentary and observation that appeals chiefly to the MTV and BET crowd. This is to say, he offers nothing of value other than allowing Penn to make their quota. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs."
3,"It's great he feels that way,but.......","It's great that he feels that way,but he must know,as well as others that there are alot of white males that feel the same way,too! Don't count us out either,ok???? Dyson seems to realize that every woman falls into this praise as well,just not black.If he was Jewish,he would praise Jewish women and so on,which is fine.....Every woman should be praised,too!"
4,"Good Book , but ...","Great book , but it has some bad language in it . I recomend it for people sixteen to thirty , not much of a kids book . I haven't finished it yet , on chapter 12 . Great for someone into extreme sports , like skateboarding , snowboarding , surfing , or BMX ."
5,Great for the thirsty little Spiderman fan,"I bought this for my nephew because he was going through a ""Spiderman"" phase. He LOVES it. The cup is not as big as I though it would be, but it is the perfect size for a kid (he's 4). It's been pretty durable too. He's dropped it a bunch of times and it hasn't cracked even a tiny bit."
1,Convoluted Story; unlikeable characters,"This book couldn't have had worse characters. They all did dispicable things and were so flimsy and unlikeable, that it was impossible to respect any of them. Unfortunately, the prose couldn't carry the weak storyline and poor characterization."
2,Useless,"I'm giving this 2 stars because I didn't get any untoward side effects, but I felt no different after taking this supplement for several weeks."
4,Outdated product but works great!,"Although Rayovac does not make this product anymore (not sure how long it has been off the market) I have the Rayovac 15 minute charger and wanted more of these batteries after my original set (bought 7 years ago) stopped holding a charge. The condition of the packaging was new and intact. They were delivered within the time frame promised by the distributor. The batteries charged right up and I have been using them in my digital camera and they seem to hold their charge as well as should be expected from new batteries. Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
5,Rayovac rocks!,"I've had some of these AA Ic3's for YEARS, that are still working. Sometimes I have to twist them when I load them into the charger, to get them to start charging. I've noticed other reviewers mention the same problem, but to me it's pretty minor. These are so great for my kids toys! We've used them in Leapsters, keyboards, cameras, etc. I don't understand why they aren't available in local stores anymore, they are terrific batteries that last forever. 15 minute charging systems are hard to find and expensive, so I'll be buying more of these batteries online while I still can, instead of investing in a whole new system. And yes, they do get hot when they charge, but I've never waited for them to cool down before using them. It's no worse than grabbing a mug of hot coffee and they do work right away."
2,"Not bad at first, but ...","Sure it's fast, but it's hot, really hot. Once charged you have to let the batteries cool off for a good 10 minutes. So how fast is fast if you can't use your charged batteries right away !!And then there is the shelf life issue...after 8 months of using and recharging my Rayovac I-C3 batteries, using the RadioShack 15 minute i-c3 charger, my batteries don't hold their charge for very long, not even for a month (forget about storing these batteries for emergency use) and they seem not to last as long as before.I have moved to using eneloop NiMH batteries and the La Crosse charger, hoping this will be a better solution."
4,Quality is OK for me. NOT sure I'm LOVING the Menu's,"I bought this set YEARS ago and I'm JUST NOW getting around to watching it. I haven't noticed any issues with audio quality at all and the video quality is adequate. What I can't understand is WHY (since there are several episodes on a disc) do some of the discs not have ""Play ALL Episodes"" and some disc do? Strange! Usually you have the option to play title/chapter or ALL episodes? Not on this (at least on some discs) Other discs DO have a ""play all"". It's kind of inconsistent as far as that goes. It kind of grips at me because sometimes I like putting the dvd in and choosing play all to let it play through automatically.As for the series. I remember watching this when it premiered on CBS in Sept 1985. LOVED IT! Some stories are better than others as was the case with the original version as well. I personally think any original TZ fan will want to own this."
5,Great TZ series a must have for your collection!,"What a great series this was! I wish they aired it on TV through the years but FINALLY it is worth the wait to have it on DVD. As a young boy (now 32 y/o) I remember watching this series in amazment every week and loved all the episodes. My favorite was the episode called ""WORDPLAY"" with Elliot Gould and how words were changing and he couldnt adapt to the world around him. I remember Breakfast was now Dinosaur and it really screwed with his head! Boy I loved this show...The borrom line is BUY IT you will not be disappointed!"
5,Nice for the price,"Not the original B/W series of the early sixties, but the revived series. It is still a great TV show and this includes all the episodes from 1985-86. Some really good stories."
3,"Great Episodes, Bad Viewing Quality!!!","The 1st thing I noticed when I started watching these episodes was how grainy and unsharp they look....This was very disappointing to me as part of the ""DVD experience"" is a digital quality....They charge $50.00 for this set, for a show that has been paid for since 1985, seems like they could have taken the time and expense to clean these up..Makes you feel a little cheated in that end of it...Makes me reconsider buying the rest of the seasons when they come out...At least for $50.00.....Its more of a $20-$30 set with this kind of image quality....So beware when bying this set...Great episodes, but no DVD quality here!!!!"
1,Return,"I Received The Wrong Item - Purchased Twilight Zone 1985 Season 1, - Received Twilight Zone 2002 Season 1. The Item Was Returned And I Was Issued A Full Refund, But I Had To Pay Return Postage Even Though I Did Not Receive The Item As Listed On Amazon. Thank You."
3,Night of the Meek,"I bought this for the episode that included ""Night of the Meek."" You can find the older version everywhere but I like this one better. I am not much of a SciFi fan but I found that I enjoyed most of the episodes I watched. I agree with other reviewers about the quality. If you buy this don't expect the same quality that you find in any of todays movies."
4,Twlight Zone of the 1980s,"The stories are good, a few have a weak storyline and a few are re-makes from the original series. I wanted to see all new stories with strong unpredictable plots. There were a few creative stories like that, which includes the first pilot episode, which stars Bruce Willis. I still recommend the 1980s Twilight Zone if you were a fan of the classic series."
3,"Good Start, Great Middle, Lousy Finish","The Drift started out wonderful. It has charachters you can relate to, you sympathize with, get involved with. They evolve the deeper you get into the book. I even took a liking to his stick that became his ""right hand man"" so to speak. But the ending sucked!!!To have gone all that way, risked life and limb, laid up in hospital three times, just for his friend to respond the way he did when Charlie told him his neice was dead and he killed her....I almost screamed. No wonder he lived on the rails...you'd have to be crazy to do all of that."
4,Norteño Excellente!,"This album is one of the best examples of the electronica scene that has been blossoming for some years on the Mexican side of the US-Mexican border -- especially in Tijuana.There are not a lot of groups doing this kind of music, so someone listening to this album as their very first norteco/electronica may not know what to expect. It's not typical Mexican music, and bears very little similarity to the electronica on the American side of the border. This distinction makes Nortec Collective a pleasure to listen to for those of us familiar with Mexican music and other forms electronica."
1,Very disappointed,"I realy made a mistake in purchasing this. As far as i'm concerned, it is really bad. I couldn't listen to it once."
5,BRILLIANT - an amazing album that surpasses their debut,"I picked up the first Nortec Collective album back in 2001. While ""Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 1"" had a lot of hype, it was a bit disappointing. Fast forward four years, and Nortec Collective have returned with an album that truly exhibits their potential. Nortec is a fusion of norteno music with techno/electronica, and the new disc ""Tijuana Sessions Vol. 3"" lives up to the genre's name.""Tengo La Voz"" is a stellar track, one that will no doubt get the party started. ""Tijuana Makes Me Happy"" is a hilarious and refreshing stab at a crossover. Is it mocking Americans' stereotypes of Tijuana? Is it mocking their fellow Mexican citizens? Who cares! It's the kind of song that is begging to be played by an adventurous alternative radio station.Pick this album up - you will not be disappointed."
2,Should have listened to the reviews,"This album was somewhat fun to listen to the first time, but hasn't really drawn be back to listen again. An fusion of Norteño and dance music, this had potential of being a really fun time. Unfortunately, for me it kind of fell flat. Perhaps it just wasn't my thing."
4,the best I've seen and very different!,"""Dog Works"" offers original insights. By expressing a new slant on the profound mutuality shared between we humans and our canine companions the book takes us further in the quest for understanding. You will enjoy Vicki Mathison's ""Dog Works"" again and again as you explore this charming blend of images and text. Most attractively produced in an elegant format, superb photographs complement the engagingly provocative commentary."
4,Magic and Mystery for sure,"The dogs in this book and the installations they build are far more captivating and interesting than the lame explanations and half-baked theories given by the two ""experts"" consulted in the text.Vicki Mathison gives a simple background of each dog, and a description of his/her artistic installations. Photographers Tim Dodgshun and Trudy Nicholson beautifully capture the mystery of each canine construction.The theories of origin and meaning provided by psychic Penelope Winter and Canine Cultural Heritage Researcher Dr. Raymond Blake left me cold. I'd much rather marvel at the mysteries than give much credence to their explanations. Still, a fascinating book."
2,What the hell was I thinking?,"Okay, I'll admit that I bought this game because it was rated ""M"", but come on, I was 11 at the time!But that's besides the point. The point is that this game is horrible! Confusing levels, bad graphics (for the time period), and just plain BORING. It was fun at first hitting those ass monsters with a frying pan but that got boring within five minutes or so, plus the graphics gave me a major head ache!The gameplay is like your standard old FPS game, but this time you can fly! Unfortunately, the controls for the jet pack suck major b-b-b-balls!To make this crappy reviw short: Don't waste any money on this pile of trash! Who cares if it was made in 1995? It sucks!Go play your Fallout 3, Fable 2, MW2...WoW or whatever...- Mike G"
4,Philips #PH60210 Behind The Head Headset,"This is the third Philips headset of this kind that I have purchased. It was hard to find, as no electronics retailer sells this type of headset. The sound and voice qualities are very good. It works very well with both my cordless phone and cell phone. The only thing I have to worry about, is the swivel boom mic. If I am not careful, the swivel becomes loose and won't stay stationary. I had to tape the last one to keep the mic in place. It is a very good value and the lowest priced headset that I have been able to find. I was disappointed that Philips did not have any in stock or even anything close to it. They referred me to Amazon.com."
1,Dont Believe the Hype,"Giallo my ass. Having poor production causing you to make odd editing decisions doesn't make this Giallo film. Don't waste your time or money on this. I seriously cant find anything good about it, except it was over."
2,Disappointment 1958,I received this CD as a gift because my college graduation year was 1958. I enjoyed the very few recordings that were on the CD but not the incessant radio blather. It totally detracts from the music.I believe that the information accompanying the product should indicate that there is more talking than music. It should also highlight that if you are not from St. Louis and therefore not familar with their radio stations you will find the talk patter really boring.
1,Just dropped from excellent to poor!,I received this lens from Cameta Camera and gave good feed back to the seller. The gift recipient then used the lens and found it defective. The AF motor would not function. Now I have to hassle with Cameta for the return and replacement. PITA! My mistake was not to check out the lens ASAP upon receipt from UPS.
2,Doesn't include a metal scraper,"This product is pretty straightforward and while the description does state the contents - specifically a stove scraper is included - do note that it is a plastic scraper. I have found the plastic ones to be pretty useless. For the price, I was expecting a kit with a metal scraper which was not the case. If you are looking for metal scraper to clean off your stove top, this is not the kit to get."
5,A Blockbuster in itself!,"Blockbusters brings home the key elements of bringing a true winner to the market. You will not be suprised at the elements they bring to your attention, but will be pleasantly reminded of the fundamental points that you often forget. Excellent business analogies make the reading not only informative and educational, but also enjoyable. Knowing the problems that some of these larger companies faced and overcome helps put other business problems into perspective. I have already implemented their Dirty Dozen questions into the team plan and I am building the War Room as we speak. I think they have created their own blockbuster and I look forward to further work from these authors"
5,Strong Plug cutter,"The best thing about the CMT plug cutter is the strength. It's hard to break. You can also keep drilling and either the plug will come out of the open section while the drill press is still spinning or you can knock it out. No need to stop the drill press, just keep plugging away."
3,"Very nice overview, introduction, & survey, but not enough engineering details","Yes, this book provides a fine overview. I need to get the essential information to supervise development of autonomous mobile robots by a team of engineering seniors. This book does not provide me with enough technical information to know the essential abstractions, math models, etc. to guide the project.My favorite book on the subject is still ""Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots"" by Sigward & Nourbahksh, because it meets my needs."
5,"A wonderful source of words for the ""ups and ""downs"" of life.","I received this book from a friend during my breast cancer treatments. It is filled with short, but inspiring words of faith, support, triumph, peace, disappointment, and unexpected events that everyone encounters. I have since purchased this small, but powerful book for several friends."
4,great cookbook,"I have tried some of the recipes and have been very pleased. I also enjoyed reading about her family history. Seems a lot like my family history, sort of nastalgic. I highly recommend it.JKSenter"
2,Not what we thought it would be,My son ordered it because he thought it would launch airsoft grenades... We did not think that this would just be a name and not what it would do.. He was very disappointed.. but I guess that is a chance you take when you order by pictures and names.
2,Gorgeous shoe but..,Gorgeous shoe but I guess my foot is too wide. I couldn't imagine walking long in these or for any about of distance. Difficulty staying on my foot so I'm returning. I really wished they fit properly.
4,Shoe Review--Jessica Simpson's Fran High Heel Mule,"A bit narrower than I expected, but a nice looking shoe."
4,Great Shoes,"I had a similar pair that I loved, but they are pretty worn out by now. I was excited to find these. I saw them on another website which usually has great discounts, but they were still around $79 and I got them here for $20. I can't say I've worn them yet, but they feel good when I try them on."
4,Whatever Became Of...,"These books were fun when they first started coming out in the 60's and 70's, but they are even more fun now. Interesting, sad , and sometimes unintentionally hilarious."
4,cute,my daughter loves her lamp. it took a while to get it but when it did arrive it was just as ordered.
4,Zebra Lamp,After receiving my lamp and setting it up i was quite happy with my purchase. It looked great and went wonderfully with my zebra theme.
1,40 W or smaller,"Excuse me? What's with the description on Amazon: Use 60W bulb? The instructions on both the package and the lamp say: Use 40 Wattage or smaller/Excuse me,eh, was I tricked? I need a lamp for studying, and so I need to use at least 60W bulb. Now I got this lamp, what should I do with it now?"
4,Cute Little Lite,"This light is really adorable. Quite small, but would still recommend for an animal themed room.Works great in the grandchildrens bedroom with the full wall poster of jungle animals."
2,"Sorry, my cd didn't work",It keeps skipping and I keep cleaning the disk. I don't feel like I have the time or money to return it. The music itself is great.
3,"Outdoor use ""ok""","I just purchased this table maybe a month ago. The only thing I see as a downer is that the screws that attach the seat to the table are in ""wells"" and the water collects in them. I can see the screws / bolts rusting over time from standing water. They haven't yet but this was the only dissapointment with the construction.The look and folding/storage is wonderful!"
3,Little Tykes Storing Table,"Product is ""okay"". Does not fold up easily to just throw in your car and take places. Have to loosen bolts, etc then re-tighten when you set up again. I myself, do not carry tools with me, on all of my outings with the kids. Price was good considering umbrella came with it. If you want a table to leave up for the summer and only store in winter, would be an ""okay"" investment. Also, many sharp edges that require filing down to prevent the little ones from getting scratched or cut."
5,Great picnic table for my triplet boys!!!,"My boys got this table for their 2nd birthday. They like to sit at it and under the umbrella, it looks a lot like a grown-up patio table for little kids. I think it will last a long time and we couldn't be happier with it."
4,Little tikes table,We love this table. The only issue we had was the box was very damaged when it arrived. All of the pieces were still there so this presented no problems. My husband had it put together in under an hour. Our three year old loves it and our one year old can sit down and get up by himself. The umbrella is a little hard to push into the table but this is not really an issue because you want it to be secure. We are pleased with this purchase.
4,fairly versitle,"We bought this table for my daughter to have a central place that is hers when we go camping. It is not overly heavy for its size, I can even carry it when I need to. It doesn't fold ""flat"" but the compression is okay - it is enought that we can put it in back of the motorhome on the top of the bed and it travels fine."
2,picnic table,"I always purchase little tikes products because they are durable, I bought this table and it was not quite what I expected there was not that much room between the table and seat, also there's really not much room for more than four kids at the table unless they are very petite. I also purchased the market umbrella which needs to be a little larger because on hot days it doesn't shade the table enough and the table could become to hot for little children. On a good note it does fold for easy storage an is easy to clean !"
5,grandchildren love it,We purchased this for our triplet grandchildren and their 1 year old brother. It is a perfect table for the yard or in the house. It has plenty of space for play or learning. According to their parents the children age 2 years and 11 months have plenty of space.
4,"Nice table, love the amount of seats for the kids","This table is great for those hot summer days. My husband was able to assemble it easily enough on his own. My only complaint is that the umbrella did not fit into the center hole without a whole lot of muscle. It seems when the table was molded and the top attached to the bottom, the center hole was slightly off, which makes for pushing in the umbrella very difficult. My husband was able to strong arm the umbrella in, however it sits a little crooked. I would still recommend this table because it has the greatest amount of seats when the little ones have their friends over. It was also the only table I could find that had a smooth top, which I preferred since I wanted them to be able to draw pictures, do crafts projects, etc. on it."
5,My grandkids love this table!!,My grandkids are enjoying this table. We have bought it for two of them now:) They have lots of fun having lunch on it when we are all together and when they are with their little friends. It is very sturdy and is big enough for at least 6-7 little ones. I would highly recommend this to everyone.
4,great item!,Very time consuming to put together but is very sturdy and nice. The fold up isn't as easy as it makes it seem but isn't difficult either. Just requires removing butterfly bolts. My daughter loves it a lot. Great purchase and way underpriced.
1,fold and store picnic table,I bought the fold n store picnic table for my granddaughter's birthday. No one could assemble it. There were too many pieces and it was too complicated. Plus the fact that it would have taken many hours. She was extremely disappointed. I lost the shipping charge when it had to be sent back. What a disaster.
3,The benches are weak.,"Overall the table meets it's purpose, although the benches are a little on the weak side. It states it is meant for 6 children, but if all 6 (about 35-40lbs each) are on it...the benches seem to sag in the middle. The benches are held up only on the sides. There needs to be some type of support in the middle. It is okay...not that great."
2,Poor quality - deceptive marketing,"My 6 year old son and his friends used this for the first time today - what a nightmare! Four children (ages 5 and 6, between 40 and 60 lbs each) tried to sit at the table, one on each end. Each child's seat began to sag backwards and one child even fell off because the seat sagged so much. This table is very poor quality. The marketing for it is very deceptive because it states that up to 8 children, up to the age of 8, can sit comfortably at this table. Not so! I am going to try to return it immediately."
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER A FEW MONTHS,"Despite the difficulty in assembling and the fact that it was not the best made table around, it served a great purpose. I bought two in fact, one for my grandkids at home and one for my home. Now, a few months later I noticed large ugly rust spots under the tables. It seems the plastic is not sealed, water got in, and the screws rusted out. The rusty water drips on the floor staining my patio. I have contacted Amazon about this issue. I say don't buy it if you are going to use it outdoors."
3,Good product but some minor problems..,"**I had a hard time assembling this little tikes table with umbrella, maybe because I don't have a socket wrench that would fit on the screw! so I ended up using a plies to hold the bottom screw.**Easy to understand manual/illustration instruction**It takes 2 people to assembly this table.**Found an opening/hole on the side of the chair but did not bother to return it -__-, I just push it with my thumbs and there you go no more opening *LOL* but when it shows up again, I'll apply some epoxy to seal that dang opening.**Overall it was a good product for the kids to use on the backyard and inside the house. I would recommend this product! ^^"
4,Very Pleased,"We got this for our son's 3 year old birthday party. He loved helping us put it together! (It was not hard) He immediately was excited to sit on it and he likes playing with the umbrella most. It seems very durable, but the plastic scratches easily on concrete...found out thanks to my son's ""help"". It is a great asset to our backyard and perfect for his size."
4,As Expected,"We've only had it about a month, but it seems to be working out well. Assembly was not hard to understand, but kind of cumbersome if you only have a small workspace. Ideally, you're balancing part of the table on an elevated surface while you get all the legs on, but once some of the legs are on, then those need to be able to hang off the elevated surface while you're doing the others. The umbrella seems very durable. It's been rained on quite a bit and is holding up nicely."
5,great table,"I purchased this table for my grandchildren. It is great. The triplets are 1 1/2 years old, a 4 year old and a 5 year old who use this almost everyday. There is plenty of room for all and friends. Very sturdy - just great!"
1,A big disappointment,"I was terribly disappointed in the this book and I have alreadysent it back for a refund. It is a VERY thin book with a large fontand the last third of it consists of lined sheets to use for discussion questions. I can use my own tablet, thankyouverymuch, and I don't think it's necessary to include these pages in the book - it's just padding! Not nearly enough content to justify the price. The only thing of value in the book are the definitions of literary terms, but you can look those up in any dictionary. I have seen other books that are far more valuable and I intend to pull them down off of the shelf and forget that I ever bought this one. END"
5,Very cool vintage look,I ordered this clock for my kitchen and LOVE it! It has a great vintage feel to it and is a fun addition. It looks like I bought it at a much more expensive store - Great job target!
5,Silent Case Fan,I have to be honest and tell you I have not installed this fan because I ordered the wrong size for the side of my computer case. I did install two 80mm just like this 92mm in the front of my case and it is the best thing I have ever done for myself as far as noise control. Don't believe you can go wrong on this one.!!!!!!!!!!
2,"Easy installation, didn't solve my problem.","I have a 2 year old Dell Studio XPS 435 MT - the computer with the loudest fan know to man. If I had done a better job reading reviews on the computer I would have know that the fan noise problem on these computers is widespread and Dell has done little or nothing to help customers.Shipment was relativity fast (though anything that isn't coming from Amazon directly feels like it takes ages). Packaging was simple yet appropriate.Installation was a snap. They provided rubber screw replacements - much easier than using the factory screws. I was hopeful that my problem was going to be solved easily.When I restarted my machine that turned out not to be the case. The fan made just as much noise as my previous (factory) fan. So, while my issue is not fan related I subtract 3 stars for being no more quiet than the factory option."
5,The scenes you are about to read are TRUE!,"After 17 years in the business of selling and demonstrating complex software solutions, I have never found a better, more practical book about both the art and science of the demonstration!"
2,Reviews do not hold true for my hair,"I have fine hair and was having lots of split ends and losing of hairs. I got this thinking it would just be a miracle. While it is a decent conditioner, I havent seen the results that people are raving about in these reviews. I also got the green tea reconstructor, but again, nothing to write home about in my opinion..."
1,Dissapointed with Aphogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor!,"I've researched many different products prior to my purchase of Aphogee Keratin 2 Minute Reconstructor. I decided to try this product based on the great product reviews. So far I've used this product 4 times, and my hair doesn't look healthy or shiny. I had dry brittle hair before, and now my hair is not so dry, but I've got lots of split-ends!!!"
5,It works!!!,"This past summer, I kept having a problem with my hair shedding and being dry and brittle. It didn't have the shine or the luster that I was used to having. I thought that I needed to deep condition it more often and that didn't work. Finally a friend of mine suggested trying the ApHogee protein to see if that helped. I did and it worked after the first time I used it! Immediately, I could tell a difference. I followed up with the ApHogee 2 n 1 conditioner once a week. I find it best used about 2 to 4 weeks before you are getting a relaxer but no more than once every 8 weeks."
1,Not good,"I'm not sure where all these glowing reviews are coming from, but I am not at all impressed with this reconstructor. I've used it several times and each time it leaves my hair feeling limp and tangled afterwards. I much prefer the reconstructor that comes in the Optimum Care relaxer boxes which leaves my hair feeling thicker and smooth. This stuff is going in the garbage."
2,rip off,these products didn't do anything different to my hair. I got almost all of them and none of them is good.
3,hmm,"Boy does this leave my hair feeling dry and brittle. If you are going to use it, follow it up with a GOOD GOOD moisturizing conditioner. The product is good to add some protein to the hair though."
5,Gave my hair life ^_^,"This is my no. 1 hair product. Before discovering this, my hair was so porous, meaning it's loses moisture at a fast rate resulting in really dry hair. This correct my porosity very good. It also adds softness and strength at the same time. I'm relaxed btw. I use it weekly before I deep condition or I add some to my conditioner."
3,"Average - not extremely conditioning for thick, wavy hair","I bought this after reading the good reviews and I was also looking for something to help maintain a keratin treatment (bkt). I've used this Reconstructor 4-5x now and it really hasn't proven to be conditioning for my thick, wavy (and a lot) of hair. I've used more conditioner each subsequent time just to make sure I was using enough, but the results are the same.I'm not thrilled about this product, but will keep it and use it up (as shipping it back will make this cost that much more in the end!)"
3,Reconstructs your hair strands,It was a good midprice product to help stop damage. If your hair needs protein then this is a product u might wanna buy
3,Not such a great thing for me,My hair dosent get any soft with this not even if a leave it up to 10 minutes and even masage it... what is true is that when i blow dry my hair after using it my hair looks stronger but llack of shine...
5,"Latin Music in the Percy Faith Style, Easy Listening at it's Finest..","The music we folks of the late 50's, early 60's enjoyed back then.I was in the music business for 10 years then. We always loved when Percy Faith produced a new album. Latin music has the appeal to all ages with it's great beat. Another favorite Latin style are the Prez Prado's CD's. Great music to dance to or relax after a stress filled day."
3,Decent,"I used this cord for an external WiFi antenna, and it worked for about a week. After, I could not connect to any networks."
5,Great primer on corporate finance,"Written primarily as a hornbook for law students, Business Organization and Finance is nevertheless accessible to an intelligent layperson. Especially important to me is that it gives a pretty good account of the types of securities and financial instruments used by corporations from the perspective of a corporate lawyer. The math isn't difficult, and although the subject matter can be difficult, a careful reading is well worth the labor."
5,Memorable book,"I bought this book (an autographed copy) when it was first released. I have read it several times and will no doubt read it again.Yes, I am a dog lover and breeder/exhibitor, but I don't think that that is at all necessary to love this story. It is one of the few books that I can always remember. I cannot recommendit enough and I am thrilled to see it on Amazon. A terrific gift for anyone.And no, I am no involved with the people behind this book. I know that the author is dead. That is it."
2,Disappointing Approach,"The style of the playing in this performances is very ""unique"" (read: odd). I bought it looking for a modern and historically informed performance. What I got is hard to describe but I'll give you some pointers. It is on modern instruments, with romantic sound (including ever-present vibrato) rather slow and contemplative (stiff). If you are looking for ""traditional"" performances go for I Musici, who although dated, have energy and elegant expression in their playing. The bonus on Palladian Villas is corny."
3,Missing some songs from originals,Had this entire series on tape and when discs came out I decided to upgrade.Unfortunately after receiving half this series on discs I discovered many songs were missing on these cd's that were on the tapes.Very disappointing..
3,OMIT THE NAME GAME AND WE'VE GOT A KEEPER!,"To this day I can remember seeing the orange cartoon mail carrier in my local post office, ""Mr. Zippy"" reminding folks to USE THAT ZIP CODE! I loved ""Eve of Destruction,"" the social commentary against the Vietnam War.On 2/12/2000 I heard Barry McGuire, along with John Michael Talbot sing this wonderful social classic and that was such a treat. I also loved the 1965 Studebaker commercial. (I was a child of a Ford Falcon sedan household, loved that car so much that I would, 30 years later name my dog after that very cool car).I would have given this a 4 or maybe a 5 star rating, but ""the Name Game"" cost it a star (or two). I just can't stand that idiotic piece and have found it impossible to listen to ever since I was a very young child. In adult life, I find I hate the ""Name Game"" as much now as I did as a child. It was the very first thing I hated to the point of being unable to listen to. It is sheer torture."
1,no safety cap on sensor,dont buy from amazon.com they get the anti-seize grease all over the sensitve sensor and into tiny hole- destroying the sensor. Call Bosch if you dont believe me. Bosch sends out or packages all there oxygen sensors with a clear plastic cap on sensor portion and a cap on the pigtail. I have no idea what amazon.com distribtuon/fullfillment is doing- someone is taking off the caps or they are buying in bulk and not putting them on...Happened twice... dont buy
4,Extremely Satisfied,"I purchased this sword because the one my son got from Disney World broke and he was extremely sad. After receiving this sword I noticed that it was not as shiney as I expected but that it was a lot more flexible than the Disney sword, making it less likley to break and it looked almost identical to his previous one."
3,Rosetta Stone English Explorer,Great product- but only contains 22 lessons. You must upgrade to get the rest of the level-one lessons (total of 92). It costs 140$ to upgrade. This should be mentioned up front.
1,"If you like to watch actual hunts, don't buy this!!!","I bought this for my dad and we were both 100% disappointed. They basically just film the guy talking, and maybe show 5 min of actual hunting. So if you want to see some actual hunting in a hunting video, this is not the video for you. Huge waste of money."
2,YELLOW not GREEN & HANGS CROOKED...,"I wish the item had been more like the picture. It won't hang straight & is more yellow than green. It also is covered with a faux ""rust"" that was not done well. Not very satisfied."
3,B&L magnifying glass,"It was fine. I seem to have lost it. It did what it was supposed to. Perhaps my grandsons have ""borrowed"" it?"
1,Unhappy,"I bought this product based on the name ""Bausch & Lomb"", and boy was I disappointed. The thing looks and works more like something one would purchase at ""Only a Buck"" stores. I was very disappointed in the look,feel,and performance of this product. Just another example of a good name being attached to an inferior product to make a buck."
1,adds to the great dumbing down,"Stupid, trivial and worthless toilet paper, this book takes a few basic facts and reduces what was once a position of respect into one of disrespect - it's all just some big joke about a job with perks - as opposed to public service. Don't waste your money"
1,Not worth the money,"I don't recall what possessed me to order this book, but it was a waste of money. Not much of interest that's even worth mentioning."
