3,Wears down easily over time.,"I've had this skillet for a little over a year. I have a gas stove, and I always cook on low to medium heats using a cooking spray like Pam, or olive oil. My roommate used it on high heat ONCE and it burned. Now the surface is not the same as it was when it was new, and pretty much everything sticks to it and burns, even on low heat with lots and lots of oil. So just be careful not to use high heat and you should be okay, but I think it was a little drastic for the pan to be totally ruined after one use of high heat."
3,Everything sticks to it,"This skillet's great for cooking up some veggies or beans, but I get irritated when using it for anything else. I bought this skillet to avoid non-stick material scraping off and I mostly wanted to use it for eggs. This thing cannot cook eggs - they just stick no matter how much oil or butter spray you use. I was pretty disappointed with it's capabilities, so I can't give it more than 3 stars. High quality material, though and a good size. Wish it came with a cover."
2,Disapointed,I am one of those crying about the pan sticking. I have tried all types of oils and sprays and can't do something so simple as fry an egg with this pan or any of the 3 I have. It is impossible to flip an egg without breaking the yolk because it sticks. The larger dome covered pan I have was used one time to fry burgers and now it is discolored. I would not recommend this to anyone and would love to get rid of mine. Unfortunately I threw away the boxes assuming these were quality.
5,Love this line,I have almost the whole line and have not been disappointed in a pan yet. But this is a huge pan so be sure to measure your stove eye before purchase. It was too big for my range and I reluctantly returned it.
4,Found a lid that fits,"FYI I ordered this stainless lid for $25 - great quality and fits perfectly on Cuisinart 14"" skillet:Alegacy 21SSSPL32 14 1/4"" Stainless Steel Cookware Lid (Optima II)"
4,Very good pan and great price,"We recently purchased a high power gas range that could adequately heat a pan of this size. A large skillet allows a greater quantity of food to be cooked without crowding. This one heats quickly and evenly--all you can ask for. It seems of comparable quality and weight to pans that are much more expensive. Although it is not non-stick, it has cleaned up very easily after using it to brown meats. This is an excellent pan and a great value."
4,Terrific addition to cookware.,"I purchased this skillet as a gift for my daughter, to replace one she had 'worn out'. She was quite pleased with the overall performance in cooking, but she was especially happy with the configuration of the handles on each side. So much easier, and safer when handling cooked food. I would recommend it to anyone; for price, convenience, and ease in cleaning."
4,"Large pan, even heat -","Even though this pan has the ""disc"" of aluminum in the base rather than all the way up the sides, it heats very evenly. You can't beat the price. It's big enough to be very versatile for major frying or lighter saut√©ing. It's also big enough to use a grill for small to medium items.I do miss having a lid so on those rare occasions where I needed a lid, I just covered it with some aluminum foil. Hokey, I know, but until I purchased another pan for my dishes that need simmering, that was the trick I used.As long as you watch the heat, cleanup is not too bad. I have rarely had to scrub this pan.Since it would be great with a lid, I gave it 4 stars. This pan really should not be sold without one."
5,Excellent value,"This is a great skillet for lots of dishes - from ommelet, to stir fry, to steak. I do own a couple non-stick skillets for making crepes and scrambled eggs, but this is the one I use the most. This skillet WILL NOT stick if pre-heated with low or med heat for most dishes. If I'm sauteing chicken or cooking steaks, I'd pre heat it with high heat before adding butter, then add the room temperatured meat (not frozen), then lower the heat to med-high and I'm all set for a good piece of steak. Deglazing the pan create thick, delicious sauces, something that can't be achieved with a non-stick pan. My fried eggs come out fried, and not steamed like it would with a non-stick pan. The discoloration (called heat marks) on some S/S cookware can be easily cleaned with S/S cleanser."
3,"not same quality as 12""","Like most of this line, the 12"" version of this pan is an excellent pan and value, and seldom leaves my range top. The 14"" however is a disappointment because its material/construction is not nearly as heavy-duty. Notably, unlike the 12"" pan the 14"" is NOT stamped ""18/10"". Another telltale is that the 14"" weighs only 4 oz. more than the 12"". Result: relatively lower thermal mass, less even heat distribution and retention, more hot spots and burning. In fairness, the larger diameter will put the much thinner sides farther away from most ranges flame, but I wish they'd made the base at least as heavy duty- as the 12"". Caveat emptor!"
5,"bought for mom, she loves it","We bought this for mom last Christmas, she loves it and now I benefit from the yummy food that comes from it :)"
5,8 inch skillet,"Beautiful skillet, cleans well, heats quickly and evenly. It is perfect for omelets. The surface cleans nicely. I was tired of non-stick surfaces scratching and needing to be replaced. I am going to purchase more of the Cuisinart stainless products."
5,Super little pan,"I love this pan! It cooks evenly, the handle stays cool and the cleanup isa breeze. I use it every day and am planning on getting its bigger counterparts."
4,Excellent Value,I am very pleased with this purchase. I have used it for a couple of weeks and I find it easy to use and clean. If you haven't used stainless steel before you must be careful with your heat. It doesn't take nearly as much as with aluminum. My reason for this purchase was that it was an excellent value. To get this large SS skillet for less than $40 was too good to pass up. I have since purchased a companion set.
1,Defective,"When put on heat, the pan makes popping noises. They never die down. Something is wrong with the way the metals were put together."
5,Back to pans without non stick surface,great pan cooks evenly and cleans up easily much happier with pans without non stick surface. Received a new full set for Christmas same maker.
3,wouldn't spend that much,"the stainless steel stuff I have used doesn't have a nonstick coating, but they hold up pretty good on the stove.this skillet is the right size and heavy, but food gets stuck on the bottom rather quickly.it's good to use for frying. not your under the oven, everyday skillet though."
1,exploding rivet,"I bought this skillet in 2007. Last year, part of the bottom started peeling but I was still able to cook in it. Three days ago, I was frying some turkey bacon and, luckily, not near the stove when I heard a LOUD pop (like a gunshot.) One of the rivets blew off. If I had been near it, I could have lost an eye.I called Cuisinart and they paid for me to ship it back (gave me a reference number), said they'd look into it and replace it.Since then, I've seen multiple reports of the same thing. I think this is a defective unit and they should recall it."
1,The 722 line now cheap because it's AWFUL,"Cook an egg and it sticks? Well, I've spent a week trying to clean two frying pans with every possible 'fix' I could find on the 'net. I have the full set and I don't dare use the others. Very pretty out of the box and that's all.I'm furious. RUN AWAY!"
5,Even Heating,"This pan heats up evenly, no hot or cool spots, and the handles stay cool. It's great for cooking bacon or scrambling eggs. Cuisinart recommends not turning the heat up to High, and so far, it hasn't been necessary. Very good value."
4,Good price/value ratio,"Durable stainless steel pan that retains heat well due to thick base; low energy needs. Handle is metal, but have had no trouble with heat transfer."
2,Watch out,"It's a nice looking skillet, the handle works well (staying pretty cool while using it), and it cooks with even heat distribution.However, the coating is very sensitive to heat. After a single use, the inside sides became badly stained, and there were spots on the coating on the inside wall which were marred or slightly pitted. Even after using a top quality cookware cleaner, the stains remained, and of course the blemishes in the finish remain and will only worsen with time and further use.Be very careful with the intensity of heat you use, and the size of the burner. I use a gas stove and the flames can come up the outside sides of the skillet, and even using only moderate heat the result was staining and marring."
4,Smaller than I thought.,"First, the pan is great. Cooks just as well as the other Calphalon stainless steel pans. It has a good balance and will keep in contact with the heating element (unlike other lighter pans).Since I own a pair of the 12 inch skillets, which are enormous, I thought an 8 inch would be the right size. It ends up being a little small. The cooking surface is about 6 1/4 inch across. I should have realized this when I bought it, but the product description does not include this information. Also, it has a rather shallow lip. A 9 inch pan would have been preferable."
4,large steel pan,Big enough to replace a non-stick griddle. cleans easily and cooks evenly. excellent for the price. as i never remember to use non-metal utensils.
4,Really good product,"The skillet is heavy, pretty well made, perfect for recipes that use oil and it can be use in the oven."
3,Good for the price,"It is a good pot for the price. It's not very ""non stick"" like you would think a stainless steel pot would be but it is a decent pot for the price."
4,Nice big pan,"I bought this pan a couple of weeks ago. I bought it because when I tried browning a butterflied pork tenderloin for 6 people in a 12 inch skillet, I had to do it in two batches. Kind of a pain. I have used this 14 inch pan a few times since then. It does a great job of browning chicken breasts in oil even without flour and heats fairly evenly. I agree with other reviewers that the pan does not require as much flame under it to heat it to a good browning temperature. Very satisfactory for the price of about 40 dollars. It has become a little discolored and does not heat absolutely evenly, but these are very tolerable defects."
5,14 inch skillet,purchased to match existing set i bought last year. needed a bigger pan than the 10 inch that came with the set. the 14 inch accomodates everything and has the two handles to accomodate the size. if you need a bigger pan this is it.
5,great pan,"I am a professionally trained chef for 35 years ,and found this pan to do everything it should, quallitygood , but always remember when using stainless steal cook were always get the pan HOT BEFORE USING IT AND THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM WITH STICKING"
4,Surprised....,"I like it a lot. After reading all the reviews I decided to get the pan to try out. Reading about how teflon is bad and stuff made me try it. Since it's inexpensive and so many great reviews too. I was just very worried about my food sticking to the pan since I'm not a very good cook.Surprisingly, my food doesn't get stuck and clean up is actually very easy. I guess I'm not as bad as a cook as I thought.Only thing is, it is big and heavy, but I like being able to have that extra room so I can deal with it. I just store mine in the oven. Also, I would have loved to have a lid with it."
3,good pan -too large,even though the pan seems to be of very good quality I need to return it because it is just too big
2,Food sticking to skillets,I purchased a 10-inch and a 12-inch skillet and have a real bad problem with food sticking and I have tried different amounts of oil and different temps? very unhappy with both.
3,ok,"ok item, better to go to a restaurant supply for a fry pan. S/S is not great for fry pan. would not buy again."
2,A little disappointing,"After owning and using many of this brand's products, I was a bit disappointed in the quality of this particular item."
3,Not as impressed as I had hoped . . .,"Purchased this pan a few months ago. Was really looking forward to using this high quality skillet. My husband and I enjoy cooking a large breakfast on the week-ends and the skillet we currently were using was a very worn non-stick I had purchased several years ago. It was low quality and I wanted to purchase a high end to replace it. I was so impressed with the reviews I didn't hesitate to purchase this item. Every time we have used this skillet the food sticks even though we have tried using lower temperatures and always use some oil. My husband has gone back to the pealing non-stick.I think I will have to purchase a non-stick skillet to replace this one, which is very disappointing."
3,Attractive but light,"The general construction and appear of the pan is good, and the helper-handle is a plus. However, I would have liked the heavy bottom to be, well, heavier... Heat retention suffered as a result, making it difficult to brown large amounts of meat in a single batch. For smaller amounts, though, it's fine. You'll want to keep the pan well centered, as the edges are rather thin and heat up quickly, scorching anything sticking to them. I think I'll stick with cast iron pans in the future, at least at this price point."
3,"14"" skillet","It's beautiful n made well, but was way too big for me. We made poached eggs in it n was a pain to clean. Gave it to a friend who absolutely loves it. She'll get more use from it."
2,14 Inch pan is ridiculously large - not practical,"Seems to be a nice pan, but of no use unless you are cooking a huge meal and don't need to saute anything...this is huge!"
3,Pan is REALLY big!,"I can see this pan being great for making Paella, however for just everyday things such as cooking eggs or stir fry, the pan is much too big! It's a beautiful pan and I love Cuisinart, but had I known it was so large, I would have passed."
5,Huge pan,"This pan is enormous! I needed something larger than a 10"" pan - and since the 14"" was cheaper than the 12"" (go figure!) I went ahead with this one. It is great for cooking multiple items i.e., sausage patties and hash browns all at once. Then you can do your eggs - and you only dirty one pan. It heats up nice and even (fits perfectly on my ceramic cooktop) and is easy to clean."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this as a gift for my mother. The pan is large, which is what she needed and the finish is nice. The problem is whatever the coating is sticks like velcro. Put food in and you'll be chiseling it off with a hammer later. Food even sticks through oil, it's really disappointing. The pan does NOT say it's 18/10 stainless though smaller ones do. Maybe that's the difference.My own pans are a stainless set of Sitram with thick copper bottom and they don't do this. No amount of preheating or oil prevents sticking, it's inexplicable."
5,How did I cook without it?,This is a great skillet! I don't know how I cooked for years without it.I wanted a large skillet for all around use that DID NOT have teflon. I love this skillet it is large enough for cooking everything from spaghetti sauce to a chicken stir fry and cleans up simply. The only thing that I wish it came with would be a lid.You won't be disappointed with this one!
3,"Go with the 12""","12"" is really the largest that a person can realistically use. If you use the 14"" it is unweildy and no longer heats evenly because so much of it is off the burner.My own fault for thinking bigger would be better. Good quality pan - just go with the 12"""
3,disapointment,"I wish I hadn't bought this skillet, I wish I had bought all Multi-clad instead of this. This skillet has a tendency to stick, it is very light weight"
3,Cusinart Stainless Cookware,"I expected this cookware to be pretty good... I am disappointed... The saute pans scorch, and are hard to clean. VERY unimpressed. Expected the quality of Cuisinart cookware to be much better."
2,Not For Induction,"A Google search for 'induction fry pans' took me tothe Amazon site, so I thought the pan could be usedon an induction range. Not so, a magnet would notstick to the pan and the induction range would notrecognize it. I returned the pan to Amazon.Great looking pan, though."
3,Improvements!,The skillet should come with a lid and also have a pour spout. This would make it perfect.
4,Great pan but NO LID,"I like this pan a lot, but since I don't have the set, bought it singly, there is no lid, and no apparent way to purchase one either. Very frustrating."
3,Good pan for the money,"I needed a larger skillet and boy, is this pan big! It actually covers the 11 inch burner on my new range! It gives you plenty of room to cook in. It is not as thick as some other pans and you have to watch it carefully to make sure the food doesn't burn. It is also hard to store due to its size. But the price ($39.99) on Amazon.com makes it a great value!"
3,ZAK dishes,Very cheap dishes...I had purchased other ZAK dishes from AMAZON and was pleased but these were cheap...gave them away! Would not purchase again.
1,Broke easily,"2 of the bowels arrived broken, with no external damage to the box. For plastic dinnerware, this dies not speak well."
4,Not a Youth Size,"I ordered a size large for my son since the description said youth as did the sizing chart, but received an adult large. The product was well made, but not the size I needed. At no fault, but my own, I didn't have time to return for a replacement because I ordered at the last minute to finish his halloween costume."
5,Good sweatshirt for cheap,I bought a few cheapo sweatshirts and this is the only one I still have after a year. Holds up to normal use.
3,runs small but good quality,"this hoody came before schedualed time..thank you.. it runs small on the sizes, so just be careful! the colors were great very bright, i ordered 3 of them different sizes and colors, they are pretty thick for cool summer and fall nights! id recomend them to anyone, just makesure you size one bigger."
5,Fun toy red rocket,"This rocket is durable. It is easy to ""launch"" for both my 2 and 3 year olds because of the handle on the side. The sounds are good as the rocket counts down. The people, moon, car, dog, etc. are cute."
3,nice for older kids,"We ordered this for my 6 year old space/rocket crazy son to give as a Christmas present to our 2 1/2 year old son. It turns out they both love to play with it, but the younger one is pretty hard on it - like he is with all toys - and broke off one of the doors already. It snaps back on but falls off real easily now. It is hard to believe it would be so easy to break - it isn't a cheap toy after all, but like I said he is pretty hard on things. Therefore, I would recommend this toy for an older, less destructive child. Perfect for the 6 year old!"
5,Great toy that lasts,"I got this toy for my son for his second Christmas. Now he is almost four and still enjoys this rocket every time he picks it up! It is very sturdy and easy to play with. He likes the rocket sounds and countdown. It made a great Christmas gift because it is a ""big"" toy, but not outrageously expensive. I really like toys by this company and only wish some of the others (pirate ship, castles) for pretend play were easier to find."
5,What a blast!!!,"My 3 year old son loves anything rocket ship related, so I knew he would get a ""blast"" out of this rocket ship toy. He couldn't stop saying ""wow"" and ""thanks mommy and daddy"" when he opened this gift. It's colorful, durable, and creative. He loves opening and closing the little compartments and rolling the space car off and on the ramp. The space ship has a nice sized handle that makes gripping on to it for lift off easy. Even the automated recording on the toy is not obnoxious like some kids' toys. I am so happy I got this for our son - it was a perfect birthday gift.The only thing I would change is to make the ramp door permanantly attached - it tends to pop off and it too hard for my little guy to put back on himself. A 4 or 5 year old probably could re-affix it though."
3,Fun but a little flimsy...,"My son loves this rocket. The accesories and sounds are great. However, the bottom ""hatch"" door comes off really easily and the top 2 are a little tricky to open. Otherwise, it's a colorful, fun, imaginative toy."
3,Its ok,"I read the reviews before purchasing this rocket for my 3 year old because I was afraid it would be too childish for him. It is too childish for him. He played with it for maybe 10 minutes and gave it to his little sister. She on the other hand loved it, she is 21 months old. Ramp door falls off but other than that it is pretty durable. But if you are thinking about getting this for a 3 year old and they are fairly mature think twice. Under that age Im sure they will love it."
4,Grandad's Rocket review,"There is a lot of color and noise to attract the child. There are lots of hand's on spatial intellect promoters also. It was enthusastically received by a one and a three year old alike.There's really not a lot of highlights with it. It had no instructions about how to use it, although it was simply put together and most of it was apparent. It did include batteries which was nice.If I had it to do over, I would purchase it again. Even though I'm sure neither the 1 or the 3 year old yet really knows what the ""Rocket"" represents."
3,Not Happy,"First of all, this toy according to Amazon.com is not for children under 3 years of age, so I was OK buying it for a 5 year old. However, when the toy arrives it is right on the box, toy for 18 months and up. From the looks of it, it is a ""Toddler"" toy, not a Kindergarden toy. Second, I purchased it on September 30, just 6 days ago and I paid $39.99. Today, it is being sold for $32.99 on amazon.com This is not ebay, we should not have to watch for prices to be lowered before we purchase, especially at this time of the year when this grandma is trying to purchase toys early before they run out of a toy a grandchild really wants!"
5,"5, 4,3, 2, 1 Blast Off!",My son loves this. I bought it for Christmas last year when he was 2. He plays with it everyday. He yells 5 4 3 2 1 blast off all day long! So this year I bought the space base to go along with it. He's gonna flip!
2,"Great toy, poor design","We bought this toy for our daughter about a year ago. Ever since we've had it, the doors fall off every time our children play with it. It's a great design, and the kids want to play with it, but they get very frusturated when it constantly falls apart. I would not recommend it to a friend."
1,doors fall off do not stay on,Out of the box the bottom door where the car is to drive up was off we would put it back on and it would pop right back out if opened and closed gently even once. The other doors did the same after a short time of play. Would be a nice toy otherwise but that is a big problem. I bought this toy because of the good reviews don't waste your money like I did.
4,Rocket Recommended,"bought this rocket for my 3 year old boy based on the other reviews. it turned out to be a good purchase. the doors come off a bit too easily, but i think that is due to the somewhat destructive tendances of my 3 year old. it has lots of features and accessories and appears pretty durable.i recommend it."
5,Outstanding Product!,"I teach toddlers 18-24 months and purchased this for the classroom. It has withstood 9 toddlers playing with it for a year! Very durable and the imaginitive play is unending. The children really love pushing the buttons and putting the astronauts on the potty. It has different rooms that can change by folding the bed up/down.The countdown & lights are fantastic! The dog, alien, crater & moonmobile enhance play too.I highly recommend this rocket!"
1,Door broke off within a week,"This is a beautiful and fun toy, which makes the main door (with interior bed etc.) construction all the more disappointing. It had only one tiny plastic hinge, which broke very quickly. My children are so dispappointed every time they try to play with this toy now, that I am thinking of discarding it."
3,Great concept....poor execution,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old son a year ago at Christmas. By February the doors were falling off. I contacted International Playthings several times for remedy, however, there has been no response. Considering the higher pricetag of International Playthings toys I expected higher quality in the toy and certainly some customer service.My son still plays with this toy, however, without the doors. It has proven too frustrating for him to put them on constantly."
2,Poor Construction,The small hinge for the center compartment has broken off after more than a year (of not much use) - so now that compartment falls out easily. My two year old was also greatly frustrated by the doors that (were meant?) to pop off easily - we had to constantly put the doors back on for him. The toy is also a bit too heavy. Don't like that the dog and the alien are too big to fit in the rover. I wasted over $40 on this toy - disappointed. This one is probably getting donated so it no longer frustrates my son.
3,Lots of fun but worst construction... ever!,"My kids have been playing with this toy for almost 3 years. It hasn't gotten a moments rest. When anyone comes over to the house they head straight for the rocket. We also have the moon rover and science lab thingy. The vehicles roll so nicely and it seems like it is constructed very well. Since day one, however, the doors of the rocket have been falling off. My husband tried to fix the top door - and he's a very handy guy - but nothing will keep them from popping off. Perhaps that is the point - to make it easier for kids to open the doors. It is very frustrating for the adults in our family who are constantly finding the doors lying around the house. I don't recommend this toy to anyone I know even though it is a favorite at our house."
2,"Cute, small and not worth it","We purchased this set almost one year ago. While the rest of the set is fantastic the pillow is small and continues to tear on a regular basis with very light use. The pillow rips on the fine white gauzy block which makes it hard to fix/sew. I would recommend a solid coordinating pillow!The white alphabet sheet that comes with the set is also small for our matress- which I think is standard size. We were not able to purchase additional white sheets as they do not make them but, did get the blue plaid sheets and they are fine. Overall it looks great and we have enjoyed the set over the course of this past year!"
1,Fat Camp - Not,"While in the end there was a good premise to the story, it did send the message to teenagers who are so self conscious about themselves, that even being 25 pounds overweight that they are extremely fat and that they will be made fun of and not liked it school. The book gives the impression that 25 pounds overweight is ""obese"" and almost a justification for people to be making fun of these teenagers. Take a look at our schools. Not every teenager is a toothpick and the ones that aren't, are not all being made fun of."
2,"Books need ratings like movies for Sex, language, etc.","Superficial fluff that tells girls all they need to do is exercise and eat carrots to get the best looking guy around. It puts looks foremost and disregards any building of character while it wallows in sex talk and foul language in it's dialog. This author had a good idea and could have used this opportunity to really make a difference, but instead she chose to be superficial and shallow. Amazon should really have a rating on books just like movies. I would rate this book R."
1,tastes digusting,"This is Thorne, so I thought it would be good but the taste is horrible. It turns smoothies into chalky gross thick nastiness. I was also very disappointed that I later saw smaller sizes of the product available at my Naturopath's office. If only I had tried a small amount first i would have known that the taste is not palatable. Had to return."
1,Disappointed,"I've purchased this product previously from my doctor with great satisfaction. What I bought from here though had a different taste, almost like it was past the expiration date but it wasnt past the date shown on container. Same exact kind purchased from my doctor though. Very confusing the quality just wasnt there... disappointed and wish it could be sent back. Already opened though."
2,I didn't Care For This CD,This product did not work for me at all. I felt the second part of it was a total rip off and the first part of it did not come even close to putting me to sleep. I did however like some of the imagery that he has going on but doubt I will be using this cd very much. Really a disappointment.
1,Sleepless sleep aid,"I bought this CD to help my wife go to sleep. After trying this for a week she has found that not only does it NOT help her sleep, it keeps her FROM going to sleep."
2,It works I think,"This CD features a man's voice with relaxing new age music in the background. He goes through the usual litany of instructions...stretch the arms, the toes, the fingers, and hold for 5 seconds etc. It is actually a bit difficult to understand exactly what he is saying because the sound quality is quite poor - very muffled. The soft music continues...I once began the CD before I got into bed because I wanted the music to lull me to sleep but apparently the music never makes a solo appearance. After the sleeping instructions end, it is wake-up time and the voice tells us something about getting up. I just get out of bed and off I go. But...coincidence or not, it does work."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I've had difficulty sleeping since my husband passed away and had typically used just a soothing, quiet music type cd to fall asleep to. After reading the description, and in Time Magazine no less, I felt confident that this was going to be a better option than just plain old soothing music. Boy was I wrong. The voice and words Prince uses are lame and the second cd that I choose to purchase with the first, was even more disappointing. It was suppose to be for Health and Fitness. What a ""crock"" it is identical, I mean identical to the first, only Prince may say a word or two about how you should eat healthy and exercise. Give me a break,I feel like I was totally deceived and ripped off. I will surely not recommend this to my friends! I will continue to listen to my 7 dollar soothing music cd and toss Prince's....."
1,Not relaxing,"I couldn't get past a few minutes with this tape. I was looking for something I could play and have set on 'replay' so that it would be relaxing music all night. But it starts off with a commentator speaking in a voice that wasn't relaxing at all. There was no way that was going to get me in a relaxed and sleepy mood. And if by chance I did fall asleep, then when it began to 'replay' his voice would certainly wake me up again. A soothing voice that began with a guided visualization that led into sleepy music might have worked. But this is not such."
2,nothing new,"I thought this CD would use sound/frequency technology. It instead is mostly vocal, using very old relaxation imaging techniques that I could have recorded myself. Relax your toes, relax your feet, relax your legs, etc, etc. Yeah I get it, been there, done that. Give me something new."
1,"This product is simply awful. If anything, it's kept my daughter up.","If you're thinking about making this purchase, think again. My daughter tried this and it actually kept her up. It's awful, and totally decieving. Do yourself a favor and buy a white noise cd, at least that is as it is advertised."
1,stupid purchase,It does nothing for me. A stupid purchase. Would not advise anyone to buy this CD after i listened to it
1,No sleep,It was disappointing because it was relaxing but I got no sleep. It wasn't worth the purchase of the CD.
2,Fell short of the hype,"The data provided was somewhat misleading, and the disc did not provide what was promised by the hype. Very disappointing."
3,Speed sleep CD,"I bought this CD for my wife who is having difficulty sleeping due, in part, to delayed menopause symptoms. Unfortunately, she was not helped by the program."
4,"Great system, but...","Before you buy this thing, make sure the studs in your wall are ""centered"" where you plan to hang the tv--it spans the distance between 2 studs--and for safety (and your tv's sake) make sure you're in them. There is some wiggle room, but not enough to slide the mount laterally more than a couple of inches. The tv itself will have room to move 6 inches or more, but the mount may be peeking from behind it.All that aside, the tech. support is first class--there were some issues with my tv model. An actual design engineer called me back to send the proper pieces (there's a lot of stuff in the box to fit ""any tv"", I apparently had that ONE in a million) to make it fit. Trust me when I say they stand behind this thing and are all about safety and customer satisfaction."
5,LM65T model / Easy to install,"I have a 52"" Samsung LCD and I used the Level Mount Model LM65T. What I like most is how simple it was to mount to the wall.The slots allow for being able to attach to studs easily, rather than being limited to a bolt hole. I did have to call the 24 hr help line to find out what size drill bit to use, because I didn't see it printed in the very basic instructions. I'd suggest having your own stud finder, since the one it comes with is kinda cheesy. I'm a single female & the only thing I needed help with (outside bit size) was lifting the t.v. onto the mount. Excellent product, easy install, looks good and a great price."
5,Great story!,"I received this book as a gift from friends in Chicago who know of this wonderful gentleman just before we made a trip to England. Because of this book, we changed our itinerary to visit St Catherine's Church and the 355th Memorial located in the beautiful countryside of Cambridgeshire. We can only imagine what these young men visualized when they came to these villages! This book is well written and not just another ""war story."" Bill Cullerton is definitely one of the 'greatest generation' and Chicago should be proud of his accomplishments!!"
4,excellent except it needs and ac adapter.,I started using this camera two months back and have found it to be good in all aspects of the camaera world. I use it for a hobby and am thoroughly pleased with all of the scenes i have taken some 800. The only flaw is the need for and ac adapter. Other than that it is and excellent camera.
4,A very comfortable way to get into digital photography,"Compact, flexible, easy to use and dependable, this is an unbeatable camera for the price. Image quality is very good, especially if you use the included software to enhance it. Comes with a bunch of cables, including one that lets it output to a TV, and best of all, a floppy adapter. This device (which normally sells for around $) lets a standard floppy drive read the camera's SmartMedia card, and is by far the most convenient way to upload images to your PC."
4,Great camera with one quirk,"This is a very compact camera with a high quality zoom lens and all the features you could want. It is no more battery hungry than other digicams. Its image quality is the best I have seen for its 1280x960 resolution with one caveat - many shots taken in ""auto"" (the default) or ""sunlight"" white balance mode have a bluish cast, presumably put there by overcompensating white balance circuitry. This cast unfortunatley mutes reds, greens and yellows. However, I have found that if you take all pictures in ""cloudy"" white balance mode, the cast is removed and the camera produces excellent color. Before you buy any digital camera, I recommend that you visit one or more of the digicam review sites on the web in order to examine sample images from the camera and read the reviews and especially the user comments."
4,A great choice,"I am very happy with this camera. I took the D-340R back to the store and bought this D-400Z instead. It takes way better pictures! They are so much brighter and vivid. Everyone I showed was very impressed. One friend was so impressed that he is going to buy one! I wanted it mostly for putting images on Ebay but I like to use it as a replacement for my Canon EOS camera. No film, no developing. I highly recommend this camera. I think it is a wise choice!"
5,Ease of use,I received the Olympus 400 for an anniversary gift and I find it to be alot of fun printing your own pictures and editing them to suit your own taste.
2,Tracking is a problem,"I've read that its not suppose to have a tracking problem but it does. It clings onto the bottom of the kitty's paws and in between their toes and I find pieces of this litter on the bed where kitty sleeps, on the lounge chairs and esp. right outside the cat box and the doorway leading to it.Its lightweight and very pleasing to use in many ways but finding little grains of this litter through the house makes me give it 2 stars instead of the the full 5."
2,Better than clay but...,I gave Sweat cat litter 2 stars rather than just one because it is better than normal clay litter and it doesn't have harsh chemicals. I bought this stuff because of the good reviews and the price. After about a day or two the litter smelled horrible and had a strong ammonia smell. I kept the box very clean and even added more litter and baking soda but the smell continued to linger. Once I switched the smell went away. I still have half the bag of this stuff but there is no way I will use it again. I switched back to World's Best even though it is more expensive but it's worth it!
2,Has its ups and downs...,"Pros:No strong perfumesClumps beautifullyFlushableCons:It doesn't absorb odors at all, making me almost wish I had perfumes again.It does clump, but the urine tends to settle all the way at the bottom, where it's almost impossible to get out. And since you can't get it out, it sits and rots and becomes disgusting until your cat, via leaving you little presents elsewhere in the house, informs you that it's too stinky for use (I would have realized this myself earlier if I didn't have a covered box with an odor filter).It does flush - IF you break up the clumps before you try to flush. After my first time clogging the toilet with clumps, I learned to let them sit in the bowl and then smash them up before I tried flushing. Then I just started throwing them out, defeating the purpose entirely.Moving on to World's Best next - I won't be using Swheat Scoop again."
1,My apt smells like a pet store,"I tried out Schweat Litter this week and it is the least effective litter I have ever used. There is no clumping so it's not scoopable. There is no odor control, the apartment smelled like a pet store when I got home today, I scoop daily so it's not as though the pan was filled with waste. Never again."
1,litter everywhere,I bought this cat litter at my supermarket. I thought the claims of the product to be odor free and entirely flushable were great reasons to give it a try. It does have a reduced odor - not odor free and is flushable. The material is very fine and a large quantity adheres to the cat's feet (and in the case of my very hairy cat - to the hairs on his back legs). There was litter all over my house after one cat's use of the box. Constant vacuuming - In addition - When you empty the cat box entirely you find that the litter has formed a cement like formation on the bottom of the box. It takes a lot of scraping and scrubbing to get it off. This was alarming because I had been flushing this stuff down the toilet. I only bought one box of the stuff which was good in theory but had too many negatives to continue using.
2,What good is it if the cats won't use it?,"So we originally got this stuff for our athsmatic cat, thinking it was her old clay litter & it's overpowering fragrance that was setting her off. Also because that fragrance would get in your nostrils & linger forever.The cats were okey with it at first, but the litter didn;t clup on urine & it has no deodorant, so if you didn;t change the litter daily, the cats would take to urinating & defficating on the floor instead.This stuff is pricey, we have 4 cats, so it's not cost efficiant to replace 3 litter boxes worth of this stuff a day. After we went back to their old litter, the cats stopped using our carpet as a diaper.I'd also like to recommend ""Nature's Miracle: Stain & Odor Remover,"" or at the very least pooring rubbing alcohol any plase your cat has peed after cleaning it."
4,Saves Wear and Tear on Wrists and Forearms.,"Does a far better job of removing moisture than can be done by hand! It exactly fits on an old tall kitched waste basket. I partiallyfill the basket with with water which serves multiple purposes: the weight of the water makes the basket a more stable platform for the wringer, I can rinse the towel in the water, and the basket catches the water extracted by the wringer. It can be a little aukward to use so I have to steady it with one hand while cranking the wringer with the other hank."
2,"Nide idea, poor execution","I have had this wringer for several years now. At first it worked pretty well. Then, as it got older, something in the roller rubber changed to the point where I can hardly use it. The problem is that the handle drives only the bottom roller. The top roller depends on the the pressure and friction of the item being pulled through by the bottom roller to roll at the same rate. The rollers are now either too slippery, or hard, or both so that the rollers don't move at the same rate. That causes the chamois to start to bunch up so it can't be pulled through. The bottom roller eventually slips so much that the chamois just stops dead while the bottom roller slips. This could have been avoided if the two rollers were geared together as part of the design, but they're not."
3,Good for the price,The bag is a good price from other bags I have looked at. The only thing that was not mentioned was the bag is meant to mount on their rack only. I had to make up new mounting points for it to work properly with my existing rack.
4,Nice Bike Bag,"This is a nice rear bike bag. Holds quite a bit. We had to drill holes in the bike carrier to attach bag. Once on though, it's easy to take off or put back on. Would recommend this bag."
5,This is good Baggage!,This time baggage is a good thing! All is well here - well made - tough - durable and stylish too! No probs w/ zippers ect. Plenty of room for gear of all sorts and takes a load off your back. Its not huge - not too small - just right! I say go for it.
2,Good Idea but Poor Implementation,"I was attracted to this bag because of how easily and quickly it would attach and remove from my rack and because I could carry it with the strap. I never got a chance to test it out because once I got it mounted on my Delta Megarack (which I like) there were long pieces of strap hanging both behind and in front of the rack just waiting to get caught in my wheel, brakes or whatever. I considered modifying the straps somehow but decided I shouldn't need to do that and could probably do better with another bag. I'm returning it.Another irritating thing about the bag is that when on the rack it remains partially collapsed and does not look like the picture. This is an appearance, not functional issue.I cannot recommend the bag because of the long flapping strap ends. I suppose that it might fit on other racks better but mine is a Delta Megarack and the Delta website description says it fits them all."
4,Beauty has many forms,I found this book quite by accident. The Images and the words contained in the book are fresh. Beauty has more forms than you traditionally see in the media. Pick up this book and enjoy Natural women in natural beauty. If you read Mode or are fuller in figure or have a Partner that is show them that you still find them beautiful by getting them this book -- Michael love
2,boring,I was hoping for interesting photographs of women that are not normally used in nudessadly the photographs are boring.
2,Very disappointed with this one,"Ok, I know I may incur the wrath of many here but I can't agree with the 5-star assessments of this book. I'm a photographer who shoots art nudes and I agree that large women can and are beautiful and I've seen many examples of wonderful photography depicting them as such. However, I don't believe that comes across in this book at all. In all, I found maybe two photos that I thought had some merit."
5,great psychology for the novice reader,"my favorite part was the ""personality types"" MELANCHOLY, CHOLREIC, PHLEGMATIC AND SANGUINE . this book helps you in understanding your partner, parents, children, co-workers and total strangers. dealing with people is life and this book clarifies the why, when and how people perform, react, choose or respond based on their psychological make up. you are ONE of the four it states, even though you may relate to the other descriptions. it has helped me understand why my mother is the way she is, why ""the boss"" reacts at work in the way she does, why my ex-partner did the things he did, and the situations go on. this is a book for every family wanting to learn about themselves, their kids, their parents or anyone on earth. for employers this part of the book would be good for hiring certain individuals for the job you se they are naturals at performing. an also related book is called ""the givers and the takers"" by Cris Evatt and Bruce Feld."
5,Let Me See Your Body Talk,Anyone who honestly reads this book will truly enjoy it's contents. Both sexes will benifit from reading this most heart felt book. I strongly recommend it..
1,Dumb book,"This was a dumb book, very elementary information, very generalized and inaccurate personality types, just a disappointing buy. I had seen her talk on a TV show and thought it would be better."
1,Yikes!,"You would think by version 10 Corel would be able to get it right? Wrong! This software is SLOW, buggy garbage. This program can't print anything right and will even do a number on your version 8 gems for you. Go to Illustrator or Freehand instead."
1,I wish I had not purchased this upgrade !...,"SLOW SLOW SLOW. We had been using Corel Draw 8 and purchased this upgrade. My only regret was getting busy and forgetting to return it under the 30 day return policy. 10 won't read a lot of our Draw 8 files, and it's SO SLOW.We are switching to Adobe since we feel there is no other choice from Corel."
5,Creative and well-made!,"This horse is full of detail and absolutely beautiful. My son has never had an interest in knights, but Santa brought him a castle and a few of these pieces. He LOVES them. I am impressed by the detail and the color of the horse. My son has played with them non-stop since Christmas day!"
4,Excelent product,"The p310 me is a great dlp projector. i rate this item as 4 starts because of the following: 1. in a dark room the image quality is absolutely superb for the 800x600 resolution. 2. Small size, you will not believe that the projector, adapter and cables fit in a letter size case 8x11x3 inches. 3. long lasting lamp. 4. No audible noise or heat from the fan. the only two things to complain are the low light output and connection cable that fells a little weak."
1,Thrown Together Book to Make Money,"I understand what the author was trying to do but those young people were not thinking anything about advancing black people and/or the civil rights movement. Neither was Motown. They just did it for PR. Those young people were just thinking about singing, dancing, partying, doing drugs, and sleeping around. The author used Motown to make money off the book. Notice the title 'Dancing in the Street'. I'm not convinced there is an actual tie between Motown and advancing the civil rights movement besides PR. It's definitely not worth over $10.00 dollars. Rent it from your local linrary and save your money."
3,You Know Your 510 When....,Was a cute gag gift for my mother's birthday. After reading a few realized it had more for men then women. So we will put it away for the next 50th birthday for a male. Funny stuff- if your a man.
3,Enjoyable,"Got this for my brother's birthday. He enjoyed it very much. It is a small, easy-to-read, quick book so you don't have to tax your (fading) mental capacities after 50, which I personally liked!"
2,Not so good...,"I purchased this disc looking for a recording of the J.C. Bach Cello Concerto, which I was playing at the time. The performance is alright, though I was disappointed to find that Yuli Turovsky plays part of the solo down an octave, so as to not have to switch to a higher position. Anyway, in general, it's an ok recording, but if you are a cello player, you may want to look for another recording of the piece."
2,Plastic pos,"Pnuematic driven, no electric motor. That suprised me.Will not suck down to -29 like advertised.The plastic cover did not last past the first use.Good for a shade tree mechanic but not a good product for a professional mechanic."
3,unusually odd names,"I really do reccomend this book only for people having trouble finding a name for their new addition. it is full of odd names. vey [interesting] ones like ""hecula"" and other very strange names, but if that fits your fancy, go on ahead and buy it. When we got our Devon Rex we decided to name her Aurora, one of the more normal names in the book!!!"
1,"NOT SOFT.. washed 20x, still a drop cloth","Big disappointment, expected a premium sheet (since I paid a premium price). Very stiff, even after 20+ washings. Previously had other high TC sheets, they were butter and continued to soften with time, these are not like them. You were warned. I have always liked Amazon due to this feedback feature, curious if they'll post this. Either way, these are expensive drop cloths for when I paint."
3,The Neglected and Abused: A Physician's Year in Haiti,This rating reflects the good condition of the book despite the non-returnable markings. The content as seen through the physician's eyes provides the reader with an in-depth perception of the medical difficulties Haitians faced at that period of time.
3,A reasonable performance,"I bought this CD because, as a pianist, I played parts of this ballet in the studio with some dancers. During the same rehearsal I listened to some parts of 'Raymonda' on CD and was pleased by this music, especially the Entr'acte from the first act, which was beautifully danced by a very talented young couple. In a way, to see something like that in an empty studio with harsh light is even more impressive and moving than at the colorful stage of a nice theatre.Anyway, I wanted to have the music myself. This performance is OK, though probably not the best: the recording is from 1986, the sound of the orchestra is not very warm or natural and the recording itself is too spatial, I prefer a more direct, detailed sound. The Scottish National Orchestra under J√§rvi is also OK but sometimes a bit inaccurate and dutiful. Some CD's I like because of the performance in the first place, this CD I like in particular because of the music."
5,Great series of books,"My husband and son (6years old) are reading his book at bedtime. They have read all the books in the series so far. I get to listen in and read when my husband is not home. I think he looks forward to reading these as much as my son. Here's what I'm getting as an outsider...Pros:Well written, about authors life as a boyLots of life lessons (especially about hard work)Good next step after Laura ingalls seriesEnjoyable to read out loudCons:NoneBe warned some of the issues covered in the book are deep and tough and lots over my six year olds head. But the book is wholesome and he (we) is completely enjoying it nonetheless. Start with "" Father and I Were Ranchers"" and enjoy the series all the way through."
1,quite a deception,"This book is quite a deception:* The author basically copied from other books (especially Timoshenko and Woinowsky-Krieger, Theory of plates and shells) even the errors.* There are a lot of errors in the text and equations.For the price the book is sold, one could expect a lot more."
2,Not much of a story,"After reading ""Once there was a Bull (frog)"" by Rick Walton I took a chance an ordered this one too since I like frogs and his other book was pretty enjoyable. Bullfrog Pops did have some pretty clever name calling which my husband and I found amusing. Our young granddaughter didn't understand the humor. The idea of over eating is absurd and unhealthy even for a bullfrog. So the premise for the story is unappealing to me. The name of the first person to chase the frog ""Starvin Marvin"" is so unoriginal it almost made me want to stop reading right there. The ending was even weaker than the rest of the story."
1,Does not perform as advertised !,Don't buy it. I am now on my second machine within the same year and have to return it also. The sidetone sounds like you are talking through a tin can. The second one I have includes distortion and it keeps cutting out. I suggest you look to a different manufacturer.
1,Message in bottle would be better,"This phone stinks. When someone leaves a message, they need to talk loud into the phone so the answering machine can hear. Otherwise you get messages with alot of silence and cut offs. 2nd the phone just decides after a phone call to not work when you want to make another call. I already replaced battery and thats not the problem. The best place for this phone is in the garbage. Shopping for a new one right now. I suggest you move on to another manufacturer."
1,Terible phone!,I have had this phone for about 1 year. It is the worst phone I have owned. The answering machine seems to randomly cut off parts of messages. The buttons work sometimes--if you press them hard enough! If the handset gets bumped lightly it will cause the battery to lose contact and then the phone won't work until it has been returned to the base. A BIG waste of money!!!
3,what? are you kidding?,"I've had this phone for a year and the only complaint I have isthat the battery has worn out to the point where sometimes the handsetdies during a conversation... If the phone is left out ofthe cradle, the battery dies, and then the page button to find thephone is useless. But I love the digital answering machine and therange of the handset certainly covers my whole house and my yard."
3,Sent it back,"I sent these back the day after I received them. I am sure they are great, but I realized there was soy in the ingredients and I am looking for a fish oil supplement without soy."
2,"""Symphantasy""","My purpose in purchasing this video was to find an interesting way to present the symphony orchestra to my general music classes at school. The preview of the content looked like it might be work, but alas, this video is very ordinary. The dinosaurs just walk around on the stage, the lasers aren't much (my own children said that they were hokey) and I found myself bored. There was too little variety in the production and I doubt that I will use this at school."
3,Applied Mechanics : Soviet Reviews : Stability and Analytica,Applied Mechanics : Soviet Reviews : Stability and Analytical Mechanics
2,"Not exactly what I call ""Tea for Two""","Waht I find odd for this item, is that the title is ""Tea for Two"" when it should just be ""Teapot, cup and saucer"" It woudl be even better if the option to purchase a separate set of cups and saucers that match the teapot would be available so one can really have a matching ""Tea for Two"" set."
5,"Hats off to ""To Save One""","What would you do if you saw someone abusing a child? Well here is a woman telling the world how she and her siblings were mentally, physically and sexually abused for years and no one saw a thing. Trudy has written this book full of the ""dirty little secrets"" that no one talks about to help in child abuse awareness and prevention. This is a fast paced, true and very raw book. You will find yourself filled with emotion readng this book and will not put it down. Trudy has survived and now tells her story to help show that survival is an option.Very good read!"
4,You don't become 007 with this game...but you'll have fun.,"I felt the other review for this game was a bit misleading, so here's a different take on the game.If you had fun with the spy toy feature on EYE TOY 2, then you'll be amused by this game. It's pretty hard at some points, just make sure you are lined up well in the screen and that you are sitting. (We've found it works better sitting than standing.)It's a progressive game where you have to complete ""missions"" to move on. If you have trouble with the mission you have to restart the mission. That's the only real drawback on the game. There isn't any redo's or practices.After mastering and becoming bored with EYE TOY 1 & 2, you'll enjoy this game if you give it a try.One more thing, it really isn't a game for kids 12 and under because it is harder. But if your kid is pretty good at some Wii games, then I'm sure they'll be able to figure out the hard parts.Have fun, and good luck!!"
1,Do not purchase this item,"The only way to use this item is to have perfect lighting conditions any shadow or bright spots in the room will render this item useless. We spent about two hours trying to get this item in the right light and in the correct position so that it would work at all and was at best frustrating as it would work for a minute then tell you the conditions were not right for operation. My son was soooo disappointed, and we promptly sent it back and got a refund. This technology is not perfected."
5,"Great, short bedtime book","This is a short, fun book. Not much to it but the story is fun. I like to have short books around near bedtime so my son doesn't make me read through a long one likeCars and Trucks and Things That Go. The back jacket also has a mug shot of Mo Willems, the author. The picture looks a little like me and when I first read it to my son he thought it was me."
5,I love it!,My name is Gabriel Jovet and I am 7 years old. My teacher read this book to us in class and I thought it was going to be boring but it wasn't. My favorite part was when the eye was rolling to the child. I recommend this book for my sister. I also like these books by Mo Willems Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus and The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog. I hope you like it.
5,"Another teacher, with another viewpoint...","I also teach children to write personal narrative stories, and bought this book specifically to teach the craft of writing. When Trixie is upset about losing Knuffle Bunny, her ""dialog"" is unintelligible and her facial expressions tell the story of how upset she is, over several pages. What a great way to show young writers how an author can focus in on one small moment, tell its story in depth and detail, and use sound effects in the process! Further, the fact that the reader knows how upset Trixie is, without Trixie saying any intelligible words, demonstrates the importance of how pictures enhance and tell stories. Adorable illustrations added to a story to which all children can relate has me convinced that this book is bound to be a winner in my first grade class."
3,My toddler loves it but the illustration depress me,"I should really give this book, and Knuffle Bunny Free also, 4 stars because my 2-yr-old loves these and can read them over and over. They are good stories, easy to follow, have a little lesson. They are fine. I find the black and white photos, with the less-than illustrations, depressing. Trixie has these huge, vacant eyes. The mom looks like a mom because she has a skirt, not because she looks like a woman. In Knuffle Bunny Free there is a scene where Trixie is alone in the bath feeling sorry for herself. It looks like a scene out of Psycho. I just can't get into it. Thankfully they came from the library where they are going back for good. Clearly I am in the minority not ""loving"" this book, even in my own house, but there you are."
4,A sweet read,I love the look of the photography with the illustrations drawn over it. The story is very sweet as well. Any child who has a favorite toy can definitely appreciate this book.
5,Save yourself time and order all three!,We own this entire series and read it all the time. My daughter asks for all of them but the second one is her favorite. I actually start to cry sometimes while reading the third one. We all love the illustrations and my mother who was an elementary school librarian said her younger kids always checked these out. The story lines are so well done.
5,Knuffle Bunny Lover,"This book is enjoyed by our multigenerational family. Love, suspense, humor, companionship - all are included in this tale. Illustrations enable younger kids to ""read it myself."""
5,award winner deserves a great prize,I love knuffle bunny. I love the pictures. I used to have a backpack and were ever I went I toke It.
5,Knuffle Bunny,I liked the story & pictures. Very different but really cute. I collect bunnies it was a good addition.J
5,One of my favorites!,"I only wish I had found this book when my son was younger. This is my go to first birthday gift, more for the parent than the kids. This book really resonates with me as a parent, especially since my son had a language delay. It's FRUSTRATING not to be understood! It's FRUSTRATING to be blown off by your parent when you can't communicate! My son loves this book as well, no doubt partially because until recently he struggled to communicate as well.Very cute story, and I love the graphics. I also love that Trixie's mom immediately knew what was wrong, while dad was clueless. That is certainly accurate in my household."
3,Not up to the hype,"From these earler reviews you would think this was the most amazing book ever written. It's not. After reading the book to my son, he didn't want to hear it again and was immediately bored with it. He LOVES all books and has a special lovey so I thought he would be able to relate to the book. He also told me he didn't like the pictures. It's my opinion that the most important characteristic of a child's book is that children like it, not the adult reading it. The earlier review went on for paragraphs about how wonderful the book was and in the end added ""and children like it too"". HMM? Was the earlier ""review"" written by the author's publisher or something?"
3,"EXCELLENT ILLUSTRATIONS, DERIVATIVE STORY","I'm not surprised Mo Willems received another Caldecott Honor for this book. I consider it quite innovative and hip of him using illustrations within the photographs. I applaud the artist for that. But what made me critical about the book is its story; it was derivative and unoriginal. I read the story before. I can't help to compare this book to ""Corduroy"" and the ""Velveteen Rabbit"". All in all, this is a good book. This book will be a good addition to any kid's library. Kids are dying to have this book."
1,"A Cautionary Review for this ""Cautionary Tale""","Standards for quality in America have severly diminished if this what people consider the Holy Grail of children's literature. It won't take you long to read this (or any) children's book at your local bookstore, so I suggest you do so before blindly buying this book solely based on glowing customer reviews. I would rather shoot myself than read this to my kid every night as one reviewer does. The ""art"" and writing stink stink stink. If I were the dad in this story, I would've taken the girl back to the laundromat and let her take a ride in the drying machine along with Mr. Knuffle Bunny for a few hours. The little girl is completely insufferable. And a story where the kid is having a tantrum 90% of the time can't be a good model for young children who like to imitate EVERYTHING. And why would a parent want to read this story to their kid and relive the worst part of their day?! Agh! Skip it!"
3,Teacher find problems,"Yes this is a cute book. Yes it is a kids book. However, as a teacher that teaches children to write narrative stories I have problems with this book. To solve the problem of the missing bunny the father looks for the bunny and can't find it. Then he looks agian. This would cause a child to recieve a lower grade on a writing assignment. I know books are for enjoyment but, they also help children learn to write. I would never use this as an example of how to write a good narrative."
4,"I don't love it *quite* as much as the kids do, but it's good enough :)","First, let me say that my nieces, aged 5 and 2.5, love this book. Love, love, love. We take it out often from the library.They really like playing the perennial Mo Willems game ""Find the hidden picture of the pigeon!"", and they like the story as well. It just calls to them, and when I read it they participate and everything.I find the book starts to lose its charm after a dozen dozen readings, but what do I know? I'm just an adult!"
3,School Book Review,Do you have a Knuffle Bunny? I read a book about a toddler who did. It was Knuffle Bunny by Mo Willems. This book is about Knuffle Bunny getting lost and going to thelaundry mat. I like the pictures in this book especially the one where Trixie was helping her dad. I like the way that it's funny . Will Trixie ever find Knuffle Bunny?
5,Delightful!,"I adore kid's books, especially good ones. As powerful as text is, the image is even more so. A great kids' book without engaging illustrations looses much of its steam. That's never a fear here. I love both Knuffle Bunny books (there's a Knuffle Bunny, too) for both the story and the view. The illustration are engaging, original, and alive. There's also a level of friendly realism in these that will give adults a chuckle (perhaps at their own expense). I will add frequently buy books for my (precocious, sassy, sweet, creative, PERFECT, book-loving) niece. She was four when I bought these for her, and her dad commented that these are some of the books she's enjoyed the most."
4,Knuffle Bunny,Knuffle Bunny should be the best Caldecott book ever! It is one of my favorite books! I like the part when he talked baby talk but his dad could not understand.
5,Love this book!,"Our whole family loves this book! Our youngest has a precious bunny that goes with her everywhere, so I thought this would be a good book. I was hesitant to buy it after reading some of the reviews criticizing Trixie's tantrum... so I borrowed it from the library (and then quickly bought our own copy after reading it). First, let me say this is not a preschooler having a tantrum, but a toddler not yet able to speak, so the little girl is really just trying to get her point across the only way she can... any parent who has been through this will appreciate the humor shown by the illustrations.I laugh more each time I read this book to our 22 month old and 3 1/2 year old. The expressions on the cartoon characters are priceless. My kids also LOVE this book. It quickly became a favorite for the younger one; after introducing Knuffle Bunny Too: A Case of Mistaken Identity, that became the favorite of the older one."
1,I'd LIKE TO RECIEVE IT!!,Purchased end of JULY.. STILL have yet to receive items!!! Very disapointed in service. Will not ever go through this again.
2,Worth returning?,"It just looks very raggedy in real life. Go a size smaller because its so baggy, looks maternity-like. Also it doesn't hang on the front like it does in the pic. Thinking of refunding it."
1,Under powered.,"Received a Showtime grill for a gift years ago and we loved it. It woulddo just what was advertised, sear steaks,fabulous chicken and great salmon.We finally used it up and ordered this Compact unit. It is not the same. Dryfish, overdone steaks with no browning or crust and will just barely do a4lb chicken. Cannot find the wattage ratings on the Ronco web site or I wouldorder the most powerful unit they make. This little junker is getting donatedto the local rummage sale."
5,A True Sourcebook for Information on Transplants,"There is such a scarce amount of information for families of transplant recipients. In fact, this is the only book on the subject at my local library. I found it extremely helpful and informative for many of the technical questions I had about what my father went through and would continue to endure. (He had a liver transplant 7 years ago.) I wish I had found it years ago! Thank you Robert Finn!"
3,MUSTANG CAR COVER,"THE QUALITY OF THE COVER IS GOOD AND IT FUNCTIONS WELL BUT THE ""CUSTOM"" FIT IS NOT AS TIGHT AS I WAS EXPECTING FOR MY CAR. IT DOES COMPLETELY COVER THE CAR BUT THE TWO FRONT CORNERS OF THE COVER ARE A LITTLE LOOSE AND FLOPPY."
4,Valie Export's The Practice of Love,"(from the back of the Facets Video box): ""'A dazzling cinematic tour-de-force, combining a thriller narrative with experimental images to tell the story of Judith, a journalist, whose investigation of a murder implicates her two male lovers (an arms dealer and a psychiatrist). Through these relationships, Judith discovers that in a world of male power struggles, love is complicit, marginal or impossible. The films makes a stunningly coherent indictment of male-dominated society' (National Film Theatre, London)...Valie Export is 'one of the five or six truly original filmmakers working in Europe today who have not been recognized widely and turned into classical ""auteurs"" and this is why each of her films seems initially disturbing, jarring, ""difficult""' (Gary Indiana, East Village Eye)..."""
4,Good stuff,"The Capture of Constantinople is an interesting history of the disastrous and controversial Fourth Crusade. Written by the monk Gunther of Pairis, it tells of the sacking of Greek Orthodox Constantinople by the Roman Catholic crusaders, casting the abbot Martin of Pairis as a hero. (In reality, Martin was viewed in an ambiguous light for his theft of holy relics from Orthodox churches.) Gunther serves as a kind of apologist for his abbot. The text is engaging and easy to read."
1,BEWARE: Repuation for poor reliability,"The LCD seduces you at first with a decent display, but components are cheap. The monitor died just when the one-year warranty expired. Sceptre has a growing reputation for marketing unreliable products. I would NOT recommend this product and will not buy Sceptre again."
3,Use it or lose it.,"Dr. Restak provides 28 ideas in 28 chapters for maintaining an alert mind. Many of the ideas are simply motherhood and apple pie recommendations - reduce stress, concentrate, exercise, etc. And while there are some interesting insights on how the brain works, based on PET scans and recent research, Dr. Restak's recommendations are anecdotal and based on personal experience.Dr. Restak combines brain facts with his own musings to give the illusion of a scientific basis for his recommendations. However, there are no references to studies that confirm any of Dr. Restak's mind enhancing techniques. On the other hand, playing chess, listening to Mozart and reading more books isn't going to hurt anyone either. A better title might be ""Use It or Lose It.""While you won't use this book for reference, it still rates three stars for entertainment."
4,Excercises for the brain,"Richard Restak's central message is an important one: your brain is like a putty, and its flexibility and performance is directly correlated with the amount of effort you put into exercising it - it's not the age, or some inherent 'intelligence' quotient that determines its performance.Throughout the book the author offers 28 ideas, and exercises on how to improve your brains performance. Overall, it is an interesting read, and you'll pick up a few good tips, but ultimately I felt that authors focus on the mechanics of these exercises missed the larger point: remain curious, try new things, meet new people, and you won't have to worry about dedicating time to special mental exercises."
3,I Wanted to be Wowed......,"and in this case, I wasn't. The material wasn't bad... but it was missingthat ""edge"" that sets apart exceptional books from unexceptionalbooks.What was the largest weakness for me was an inconsistency betweenthe chapters: some were filled to the brim with useful, workablesuggestions and ideas and others left me wondering, ""Wait, whatwas the intended suggestion for that chapter?""Perhaps the confusion was part of Restak's intent... to get thereader really applying our newly-stretched brainpower?*Shrug* Just not sure.... there is some decent information herewhich I will more than likely use and reuse, which is why theranking is 4 stars rather than 3."
2,Underwhelming,"Basically a book of memory and brain exercises, with a few anecdotes thrown in. I was expecting more about brain function in diverse areas of human endeavor. The title is one of the best things about the book. The exercises are probably effective, but seem so tedious I can't imagine doing them (physical activity has shown this need not be the case with exercise).Worth a magazine article, perhaps, but not an entire book. Disappointing."
2,Audio Cd is monotone,"I thought this would be a good way to start my day while walking 30 minutes. I've presented workshops on right brain/left brain integration.The monotone of the author is so boring that I never got beyond the 2nd CD. Perhaps reading the book will make this a more meaningful exercise. I bought it as an audio CD so I could ""take it with me"" and now I leave it at home!"
2,"Bogged Down, Too Brainy","Although there were some interesting parts, this book (I had the audio-book version) ultimately disappointed as it bogged down, and got downright boring."
3,Think and don't lose your mind,"Restak provides a short manual for keeping your mind as you age. The basic premise of the book is that by keeping your mind active (which causes your brain to rewire itself continually according to PET scan research) you will keep your mental sharpness as you age. He says the brain is the only organ of the body that doesn't wear out with use.The lessons, as another reviewer has said, are for the most part motherhood and apple pie. Basically, stay intellectually stimulated and participate in physical activities that require fine motor skills. The example given is tai chi. Other activities such as dance or Pilates would be just as good."
3,Plausible Ideas,"""I need a change of pace."" (We all probably say that from time to time.)This book offers an interesting explanation as to why we might feel that way: one functional part of our brain is tired and another part could use some exercise.The author elaborates on the idea: engaging in a variety of physical and mental activities is healthy for our brains and, therefore, healthy for us, overall.This seems pretty plausible to me.Easy to read and filled with interesting ideas."
3,How to help your brain function at its maximum,"This book is interesting in that it parallels brain function and brain stimulation.Simply put if you suffer from poor memory, limited comprehension, short attention span, limited analyzing and reasoning skills..to resolve these issues you must know how the brain works and what it takes to make it work better. This book gives you these tools.....while this is not a light read ... if you do read it....it will no longer be a heavy read....."
5,Beautifull!!!,Hey es la mejor tardeta por 100$ q puedes conseguir en el mercado muy sencilla pero muy buena!!!
4,"Decent, modestly priced mobo","Bought this mobo from Amazon along with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core 5000+ BE. The mobo allows me to overclock the CPU to 3GHz and remains stable running WinXP/SP3 (did not try Vista). My mobo came with a BIOS dated Dec 2007 - didn't feel a need to upgrade it since everything is working fine.If you want SLI plus some additional frills, pay a few more dollars and get the M2N-SLI Deluxe instead. I use that for a 2nd system coupled with an AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual-Core 6000+ running at 3GHz (not oc'd) with Vista/SP1.In general, I've found Asus mobos to be stable although their documentation leaves a lot to be desired, esp for people new to building PCs."
4,Great board,"I'm a novice at building computers, I've only built two before this. Everything is fairly easy to get at and well labeled. Minor issue with the IDE socket being on it's side thou. The rest is ""cake"", installation, set-up, even overclocking. If you're stuck with an AM2 socket CPU this is the board for you, runs fast, smooth, and after about the first minute really Quiet. I will be buying Asus again count on it."
1,Don't Buy,"This board has been horrible for me. Have owned it for two years, and have had replaced twice. Great board out of the box, but then as time went on just kept seeing problem after problem. Stopped keeping time, would BSOD, would only start after several tries, until finally it wouldn't start at all. THIS HAPPENED TWICE, TWO DIFFERENT BOARDS! Asked if they would let me pay the difference to get a different model, and was told they do not do that. Asked to talk to a manager and was given the run around, told he would call me back, and then never did. Google the board and you'll find page after page of forums with the same issues. I'm not buying ASUS ever again. Save your money, don't buy this board."
4,An enjoyable book for kids,"This was a cute book that my kids enjoyed. It's a good introduction to how a bill is created/passed. Contrary to what some reviewers have said, I thought it was non-partisan. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is because I didn't like the artwork. I realize that the artist is well-known and the characters show wonderful expressions, but it's just not my style."
3,He was already named Splash,"That's right - the dog was named Splash by the previous owner before Mr. Kennedy got him. So, focus on the book and not the politics. I think it's a cute book (I also own a PWD)and have given it to both of my teacher daughters for their classrooms."
3,for the dogs ?,"Probably a more interesting read for the young as to how a senator and his dog cope in D.C. While the pics helped paint the picture, I have to wonder just why Senator Kennedy lent his name to this project, which could have been done by any senator. Probably only his name warranted the effort here."
1,THE DOG'S NAME IS SPLASH!!!,"His dog's name is Splash!!!Most well-educated people should understand why that is one of the most hilarious and annoying ""coincidences"". If this was bush's book, and he named his dog, oh, i don't know, Tex? i there'd be a huge amount of people laughing. But, since the Kennedy's are royalty, they are not laughed at. SPLASH!!! THE DOGS NAME IS SPLASH!!! I CANT GET OVER IT!!"
3,"Lucien, Is That Scar Real ???","Stars : Donna Hamblin & Lucien Eisenach.Written and Directed by: Steve Sessions.Film is incredible in execution ( pun intended).Setting is mostly a haunting house,But not confined to that...Lots of car footage and a very cool grave yard scene.Donna Hamblin is perfect linchpin of a leading lady,She is a definite go-to for any film.Lucien Eisenach has a persona perfect for a witch doctor or one who dabbles in black arts,Great celebrity look this side of Criss Angel.Monster was a nice touch,Maybe alittle stiff.THE CAR,There is this Golden Hearse that Lucien drives quite an awe-worthy site up there with famous scary cars with bigger budgets.Early murders made sense and yet were senseless,Know what we mean ?"
3,I am kind of sorry I rented this,"I will finish watching the movie and edit the review if appropriate. So far I am pretty certain I wasted my money. This movie is so bad it makes sex , black magic, and death BORING! How do you manage that!"
2,Really not that great. . .,"Actors were terrible. Would like to have seen more characters, more scare, more ""action,"" more gore! I LOVE horror/thriller movies, Lord knows I've seen thousands (at my age)! The car wash scene was okay- perhaps that WAS an original thought, but still lacking. . ."
1,MOVIE REVIEW,"THIS IS BY FAR THE ABSOLUTE WORST PIECE OF TRASH I HAVE EVER LAID MY EYES ON. I HOPE IN SOME WAY THAT THOSE WHO MAY THINK IT PROMISES TO BE A SCARY, ENTERTAINING, TRADITIONAL HORROR FLICK WILL RECONSIDER BUYING THIS GOSH-AWFUL WASTE OF TIME."
4,Wonder Woman series,"Completes my set, A classic. Looking forward to the new series. I hope they don't screw it up. For it's time it was the best out."
5,Wonder Woman Season 2,I like this show and it is one of my favorites. I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of superheroes. I used to watch this show on the SCY-FY channel and now to watch it anytime I want is so cool.
5,Best of the seasons,Season two delivers what made the show great without the obsolete setting of the first and the tweaking-until-it-breaks of the third (by the end of the third season one is *glad* they didn't make a fourth).
3,"Not as good as season one, but still a keeper","the episodes get a little flaky, and I wish they had turned them into just half and hour, but its still Linda Carter, spinning and flashing and running to the great tune of ""Wonder Woman"". If you have to chose between the first and second seasons, chose the first, then when you have the dough, get the second."
3,Ms Tamma's Gift-5 star rating,This is such a big hit for birthday in November.. I got her the first season for her Christmas (2007) and she was so happy!!! She had just about given up!! Now she has 2 seasons to watch again and again..and more to build on..
5,Can't wait for the third season!,What a great DVD. Much better than the first season with lots of action pact episodes and famous stars for guests. I like how they changed the setting from the World War II to modern age. Loved the diving suit costume and the motorcycle costume. I can't wait for the third season to be released!
4,Wonder Woman Fan,I'am bias when it comes to Wonder Woman. She's like a part of my childhood. I love that the studio is producing them. I'm looking forward to more in the future. She my Shero. You truly a wonder wonder woman.
1,Very Little That's Wonderful Here,"Even as a pre-teen I felt the ABC version of this show was better than the CBS presentation. Revisiting these episodes more than 25 years later I am amazed at how poor they are. The show has one thing going for it--Lynda Carter looks fantastic as WW. Other than that, there's nothing. Though Carter's acting grew more assured on CBS, her decision to portray Diana/WW as sarcastic, flippant and bored with crime-fighting is a huge turn off. After about the first six episodes there is virtually no resemblance to the comic book character. It becomes The Diana Prince Secret Agent Show. The direction is dull. The writing strives for more sophistication than on ABC, but it doesn't deliver. Unintentional camp is the result. This is only for the most die-hard fans."
4,Second best season of the hit TV series! About ties wioth season 3!,"Season One of the comic book that set during WW2 was the best! This season Princess Diana (Carter) returns with Steve Trevor Jr to the USA circa 1977 (the time this show was made) and, as Diana Prince, she again fights evil while working for the American government! Eventually she will remove the glasses she wears as Diana Prince making it a little to hard understand why she isn't recognized as WW by those who've seen her as both (like Steve Jr)! Carter and the character of Wonder Woman was a casting marriage made in heaven---the rest of the show's cast through the three seasons is good but more expendable!"
4,Sticks and Stones,"The story is about a girl that thought about having sex and quickly changed her mind. The girl's name is Jujube and we never really get her real name. When she says ""no"" to her date, the rumors just start spreading that she is a ""slut"". Fortunately, she meets Carlos and he is nice and helps her out.I like that the girl doesn't let anything get her down. I also liked it because it is stuff that happens in real life. Lots of high school girls get pregnant and end up ruining their lives.I will recommend this book to everyone because it it is a realistic book. I especially think high school students would like this book. This could be a lifetime experience for readers."
2,Disappointed with basic navigation,"I had the opportunity to compare the Lowrance iWay 350C side-by-side with the Garmin 340C (I owned both). I found that despite having a lot of nice extra features, e.g., mp3 player, considerable configurability, the Lowrance fell short in the basics of navigation. The satellite acquisition time took much longer than the garmin, and the lowrance frequently had to update the route. Most importantly, the Lowrance offered navigation information that was incorrect, e.g., left turn where no left turn was possible. Because the Lowrance 350c failed at the basics of navigation (compared to the garmin c340) I returned it. If Lowrance can update the maps/navigation software to be comparable with the Garmin, it would be a unit worth considering."
2,Not as good as expected.,"I have had this unit for three years. When going to an address it would do a good job of giving me the best route. When entering addresses, it was not at all intuitive. It could not seem to find many of the addresses I entered. While entering addresses, I would have to press a letter more than once to get it to register. This became worse with time. The unit's power button did not always work. I would have to unplug it from it's power source to shut it down. After 3 years of use now it will only turn on in power saver mode. I have retired the unit and purchased a Magellon. Overall I would say the routing software worked well, but the unit was glitchy. I would not recomend it. If you have the money to spend Lorance makes a top notch high end GPS but you will have to spend 900.00 for it. If you want a bare bones nav unit, forget this one and go with Garmin or Magellon."
2,Not for Motorcycles,"Nice unit for a car, but it won't work on a bike. A little slow, but not bad especially for that price. I bought one for my motorcycle, but it shut itself off within 15 minutes. I called Lowrance and they thought it was a battery problem, so I sent it back (Amazon was amazingly cooperative; Great Customer service!!!). I tested the new one in my truck and it worked great, but 10 minutes in the motorcycle mount and it shut down again. I tested it in several other vehicles and it work everywhere but on a motorcycle. Lowrance and Amazon were good about taking it back, but Lowrance had no idea it wouldn't work on a bike.I just bought a Garmin Zumo 550 (made specifically for a bike) and I love it, although it's more than twice the price."
2,where is the quality?,"My iWay 350C started behaving strangely after 2 months of extensive usage. At some point during navigation mode, you could see your trail on screen out of the highway, 200 yards off somewhere in the woods. IWay was constantly navigating, calculating routes new maps and newer ending seek for position. Finally it broke! When I restart device, it shuts down immediately afterwards. I will be calling Lowrance customer service tomorrow, press 1 press 2, press 3, press 4 ....."
2,Three Units in Three Weeks!,"I bought this unit on a wim. I was leaving for a business trip and needed a GPS. I really like it and it worked well for me. Unfortunalty the unit wouldn't hold a charge on the battery. So I returned it for another one. It worked for one week and then I had the same exact problem. Which to me is not a good sign of quality when the same problem happens on multiple units. When I tried to return this unit, the unit I was given didn't work at all, it gave me an error message when the GPS booted up. Unfortunaltey the vendor I purchased it from didn't have any more units that I could exchange it for. So I called customer service and got an RAN. I am hoping when I get the next unit back in 7 to 10 days that I don't have any more problems."
2,How to get lost! Over..,"The 350C is well packaged with almost current programming. It only got me lost eleven (11) times on a 865 mile trip:All cities in Georgia - Tybee Island to Pine Mountain to Newnan to Stone Mountain and return to Tybee Island. (I packed and returned the unit the day after getting home.) It may suit others well, but I can not rely on the unit. Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences. (One wrong turn took me sixty miles out of the way.)Two were for unknown reasons. The unit seems to take forever to acquire available satellites. Instructions are clear, but preferred views automatically switch to ""Map"" even when not wanted. I need a faster reacting unit that allows programming while enroute to a destination (by a passanger, of course.)"
1,Horrible GPS will never buy from Lowrance again,I bought this GPS unit last June. My first unit I had took 2 days to try and locate a satalite and was never successful. I sent the unit back and they sent me a new one. I have had nothing with problems with the unit. It takes a long time to find your current location. My touch screen also locks up a lot. Finally the entire lower half of my screen went out after not even having it a year. HORRIBLE GPS. Would not recommend to ANYONE.
3,Lowrance iWay 350C GPS,"I had trouble programming this touch screen unit. I thought it was my inexperience with touch screens, but it must have been a defective unit because it started blowing fuses. It was returned for repair. Lowrance sent a new unit that appears to be functioning properly. My gripe is that their instruction manual is not easy to follow. You waste a lot of time going from menu to menu trying to understand their various functions."
2,Great display but poor basic navigation,"I purchased this unit less than two weeks ago and am greatly underwhelmed with its ability to navigate from point to point and its overall performance. On the pro side, the display is nice and crisp and the touch screen navigation very user friendly. On the down side, it has trouble with following a well established interstate, continually directing the driver to get off the interstate and then merge back on. It uses route numbers instead of street names and many 10+ year old pubic roads in the Washington DC area are missing. Detail of the local area is frequently marginal. WAAS works well (usually) but the system is very slow to gain its initial position location - as much as 7 minutes to initial 2D lock, even when starting from the last shutdown location.All in all - to use this GPS, you better know the roads well enough to understand when it is giving you bad directions!"
2,A bit slow and less then adequate navigation,"I used one of these on a recent trip to Indianapolis in a car other than my own. I'm comparing it to the built-in nav in two Hondas, which have a much larger screen. So, getting the obvious comparison out of the way, the screen is really small on this. My second observation is that it doesn't seem to have enough CPU speed to adequately keep up with driving. I'd say that a basic requirement of a navigation system is that it can stay ahead of your driving, but this unit was often one or two turns behind me. I think if it had an option for 2D display instead of 3D (I didn't see this anywhere in the setup), it may have been quicker."
5,Excellent photography & cute as a button subjects!,"Classic baby shots, done with flair. Colorful and bright! The perfect calendar for new parents-babies love to look at other babies! Our baby smiles and giggles at each baby in this calendar. I highly recommend!"
2,Not worth buying,"It is GI style, but the quality isn't as good as the regular issue. I deployed to Afghanistan with this and it fell apart."
5,Lets GO!,What a ruck sack! IF everything has to go then this is the bag that will just do the trick. Washable and rugged.
4,Wonderful descriptions of Nauset in a quieter time,"This is an important book because it, like Thoreau's journals, is a record of a particular place at a particular time. What did it look like then? What plants, birds, fish came and went? How did people think about the place? These questions are answered in writing that transports you back in time to an apparently quieter and more leisurely world. Yes, there's a bit too much on fishing and hunting for my taste, but I find that I just skip those chapters when I go back to this book, as I do every couple of years. A must for anyone trying to get a handle on Cape Cod."
2,Not my thing,"I'm a younger generation than the one that watched this originally on TV, so it was interesting to see what used to be the ""norm"" and ""outre"". I've never been much for spy series, though."
2,About half the episodes said they would not play on my iPad.,"Good series, but there seems to have been a format incompatibility. ""Support for iPad coming soon"" doesn't help when you're convalescing. Still, Amazon refunded the purchase."
3,Be Careful!,"I was trying to order this series as a DVD, but somehow ended up with the digital version. It is a very easy mistake to make. I wrote to Amazon and they gave me a refund. As soon as it goes through, I'll buy the DVD. So be careful! You'll save time by making sure that the movie that you are buying is the format that you really want. Incidentally, I gave it three stars because I couldn't publish my review otherwise, but I haven't watched it."
2,Not a happy book,"If you really love cats and hate to hear about them being in pain then dying..DONT READ THIS BOOK.Camuti is very preachy sounding and makes regular cat owners seem like idiots.he seems like he couldnt care less about a cat dying in pain.an example of this is when in his book he tells loving owners who have to leave their cat in camuti's care over christmas not to leave a little christmas tree in the cats cage(they just felt bad about leaving their baby over christmas)because it could possibly be bad for him they ignore him and put it in anyways(bad choice but they didnt know any better)...Camuti is a cruel,cruel man!!!"
5,"I laughed, I cried, I read it over and over again","My mom gave me this book years ago and I've re-read it several times (a rarity for me). Not only are the stories about the animals great, it's wonderful to hear about New York life in a time gone by! I definitely recommend this book and can't wait to read it again."
5,In for a treat,"Anyone who reads this book is in for a treat! And....is there another Dr. Camuti out there? House calls indeed! I laughed and cried my way through this book. And have lent it to friends, all of whom enjoyed it also. But it is possibly the amount of love and concern Dr. Camuti has for all animals that is the biggest lesson in this book; A challange for us to use our common sense in taking care of our pets. A great gift for a favored vet."
4,Charming stories,"A vet who specializes in house calls for cats from the 1940's through the 80's writes in a witting and engaging way, telling charming stories about the cats (and people) he treated over the years. A pleasant read."
5,"""Boring""? Not hardly!","I don't know how the guy from Maple Valley gets off as calling this performance ""boring"". It wasn't Mariss Jansons who was sleeping - it was that reviewer, although I don't know how anyone could snore through the supremely powerful 4th movement. The performance is excellent, with the right combination of drama and intensity, and there is a suitably dark, Byronic feeling, just like the score deserves. Same with the sound quality - the recording is masterfully engineered. Buy this now. And don't forget to read Byron's work, either."
2,Zzzzzzzz.....,"Jansons is very much a Tchaikovsky expert, and could likely conduct this work in his sleep. Unfortunately, it sounds like that's precisely what he did during this session. I always thought that, given a bad interpretation, Tchaikovsky could be made to sound overblown, cheaply sentimental, or downright tawdry. But boring? Somehow, Jansons manages to do so. The overly-distant recording doesn't help matters, either."
2,Tchaikovsky: Manfred Symphony - Jansons,"The work, as presented by the Oslo Phiharmonic Orchestra, Jansons conducting, falls far short of this listeners expectations. It hardly represents the passion one believes Tchikovsky felt and intended that makes the same work exciting and unforgetable as played by the National Symphony Orchestra of Russia. I regret that CD was not available."
1,Tons of false information,"First of all, this book is very poorly written. It reads like someone whose native language is Pakastani wrote it. Many sentences don't make sense, and many other sentences are contradicted by the following sentence. Much of the historical and musicological information is flat out wrong. The origins of Christian chant described were disproven long before this book was written. Jewish worship is especially misunderstood. There is even a remark that reminds one of the Nazi party, written of the Copts: ""Descended from the Ancient Egyptian peoples, they are considered one of the most anthropologically pure races in the world."" (p42)"
2,Looks nice but....,"It is a nice looking mug. The big problem I had with it was that I wanted a stainless mug. Unfortunately in the description it failed to mention that the entire interior is plastic. So, if you are trying to avoid drinking out of plastic this is not the mug for you. I can not rate it as to the function because mine is going back so I can get a true stainless mug. It does look like it would be a great mug if you didn't mind the interior being plastic."
3,It's OK,It is a nice mug. I like the look but it doesn't keep the temperature very long. After about an hour the coffee is -as much- slightly warm.
5,Super DVD picture!!!!!!,"When I used the composite video cables, I don't like the quality very much though still impressive. So I ordered the monster COMPONENT VIDEO CABLE FROM AMAZON and plugged it to watch a DVD--JET LI's HERO---WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! Amazing picture quality!!!! I haven't seen such a clear picture before, not even the higher resolution and more expensive LCD TVs. Totally amazing. Seriously, the TV picture is good though probably not as crytal as a tube TV but for movies, absolutely better. Everything is so easy to use. No front video or audio jacks. No panel cover. Haven't found any weaknesses so far. I think it would be a great one. I also like the Sharp Aquos B4U. I don't agree with the previous reviewer: the reviewer says the Samsung is much better than Aquos--in fact, I think they are about the same; but it is true that Aquos' speakers are a little weak and unclear. But for picture, about the same. Aquos was once my favorite."
1,"Awful writing, ridiculous characters and a moronic ending...","I bought When Harry Hit The Hamptons as a beach book for my vacation. I wasn't expecting Hemmingway, but was hoping for some light entertainment. Unfortunately, just within a few pages, I realized that this is a lost cause. Ms. Goodman-Davies's characters are absurd. No one talks the way Harry or Penny or Jessica talk, unless they are brain-damaged. And I am at a loss of words when it comes to how the character Juan speaks. I doubt that the author has ever talked to or knew a Spanish-speaking person.The character Harry uses the words ""dude"" and ""man"" excessively, because he is from Los Angeles. And the author's endless references to ""JAPs"" and ""WASPs"" were truly nauseating. Finally the sexual situations were so juvenile that they can only be written by a teenage boy whose only source for sexual knowledge is Playboy.All in all, a total waste of time and money...even for a beach book."
2,I've read better self-published books,"This author obviously knew some dirt on someone in the publishing business, otherwise it would never have been published unless she paid for it to be. And maybe she did. Horribly written, terrible editing (if any), characters I didn't give a rat about. Beach reads/escapist novels abound and I read a lot of them. They are all, without exception, by authors who know encyclopedias more about writing than does this author. AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL. I can't imagine her comedy career was anything but painful for her audiences if this novel is anything to go by."
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.I will say one thing for sure, this is a one day read. Not because it was good, but because there is a lot you can glance over and still not miss anything. Morrell seems to have become a bit subdued with this latest thriller, wich includes a few suspenseful parts and a lot of filler. With the quality of writing that Morrell has had in the past though, I'm not about to let his next novel go without reading it, hoping it's as good as his previous books."
4,A story filled with suspense!,"Brad Denning's younger brother, Petey, disappeared twenty five years ago, and Brad was one of the last people to see him. While walking down a street in Denver, a man approaches Brad claiming to be his long lost brother. At first Brad is suspicious, but the man gradually gains his trust, and Petey starts to become part of Brad's life again. However, after a few weeks, Petey disappears again...along with Brad's wife and child.This story sucked me in from the start! Once the scene is set, and Brad starts the long search for his missing wife and child, there are many suspense filled moments. There is also the question of whether or not the character claiming to be Petey, is really who he claims to be. This is one of the better thrillers that I have read this year."
2,Morrell is losing his edge,"David Morrell has long been on my ""Must Buy"" list of authors. Up until his most recent efforts, I have automatically purchased his books as they were released and waited anxiously for the next.Unfortunately Long Lost is the latest in a string of increasingly depressing novels that I have found a difficult time completing, let alone enjoying."
1,"In A Word, Awful","This was quite possibly the worst book I ever read. First Blood was, of course, a classic and The Testament great, but Morrell hasn't written anything good in years. Don't waste your time on this ridiculous story and characters, even as bathroom reading. Even his most diehard fans couldn't possibly like this book."
3,Actually 3 1/2 Stars Good Thriller,Brad's brother Petey was kidnapped when they were kids because of Brad's actions .Years later a stranger comes to Brad claiming to be his long lost brother.But Petey has been through some terrible things in his life and blames Brad for them.And so the thrill ride begins.This was an edge of your seat thriller. Yes I did figure some things out before the main character did but it still made me sit on the edge of my seat waiting for Brad to figure out the mystery.
4,Chilling,"Great read. Once I started reading it I could barely stand to put it down. It is writen in such a way that compels you to want to keep flipping the pages to find out what happens next. I also recommend reading Morrell's ""The Protector"", another fantastic read. Morrell is a fantastic author and I look forward to reading more of his novels."
4,Nice but needs improvement,"I've had this product in my car for 10 years. Although it has come in handy during many allergy seasons, I have two major complaints. The clips are too close together and prevent me from opening the mirror on my visor. And a few years ago the leather on the clips began to disintegrate and left two large black stains on my visor. If the company improved these two problems, it would be perfect."
4,Tempo Black Leather Visor Tissue Holder,"There is always a need for tissues in my vehicles, either for my wife, myself, or our grandchildren. The visor tissue holder is the most practical way to keep tissues at-the-ready and we've found that the ""Tempo Black Leather Visor Tissue Holder"" fits the bill perfectly; it's handy, durable and practical. Another reason that my wife and I always shop on Amazon."
5,really weird but cool,i had only heard of grandaddy through word of mouth. i read that they were really good and i knew people who really liked them. so i picked up the album. and i love it. it is very reminiscant of bowie's ziggy stardust and has a similar spacy sound. i really like the bizzare lyrics by jason lyte. they are fun to read and listen to cause i am always wondering where he thought of this stuff. if you enjoy bowie and radiohead by this album. it is worth the money.
3,It Strains a Bit too Hard,"This fits into a continuum of recent albums, from Sparklehorse's ""Good Morning, Spider"" to Giant Sand's ""Chore of Enchantment"" to the new melancholy releases from The Mekons, Yo La Tengo, Modest Mouse and Lambchop. If you like those, you'll probably like this, too, though it doesn't quite reach the heights of some of the others I've mentioned. It's been a stellar year for this kind of music, and this particular CD is good, but second-tier."
3,Pretty good...,"Thought it sounded like Neil Young would if Neil started writing songs in 1995 and played keyboard instead of guitar. Same sort of voice, song-writing style."
3,Leaves a stale taste.,"Usually I have no problem when bands wear their influences on their sleeves, but with this album I just can't take it. It is a decent listen, but when you do listen to it you can't help but be reminded of other bands. Then you realize that those other bands are much more enjoyable to listen to, why not just listen to them. If you are looking for an album that is close to something like the flaming lips, radiohead, or neil young this is it (as many reviews have said). It feels second rate to those bands. It is original, but at the same time it is not. But if you are fine with that it is a decent listen."
4,Tremendous listening experience,It's magical how one moment you think your listening to the likes of Radiohead with haunting vocals then be catapulted into fun driving rythym guitar lines with quirky keyboard breaks reminiscent of the Pixies (Crystal Lake). Wonderful!
4,Beautiful-,"Rock with a sense of calmness & serenity, beautiful songs(esp. crystal lake)- full of charm & atmosphere-"
1,What's all the fuss about?,This CD comes highly recommended but I can't figure out why. Jason Lytle is an average vocalist at best and the songs and instrumentation are pretty run of the mill.
3,if you like...i guess....,"if you like radiohead (hail to the thief era), then by-golly, pick this album up.the warbling vocals and convoluted, some times amusing lyrics will put you directly in that place; as will the simplistic, yet grand instrumental work.i'm just not a huge radiohead fan, so, it doesn't do it for me. however, Granddaddy does an excellent job of sounding exactly like radiohead."
2,ugh,"I read about how Grandaddy appealed to fans of Radiohead and Badly Drawn Boy (two of my favorite bands), but Grandaddy is nothing like them! This album is a terrible attempt at music. The songs are jumbled and really random, without any real continuity. The album feels like someone took some of their songs randomly and put them in not particular order. Don't buy this! Get Hour of Bewilderbeast by Badly Drawn Boy instead!"
2,misleading,"Now I bought this thinking it was ""The next O.K. computer"" how wrong. This isn't anywhere near the level of Radiohead. Don't be sucked in. Instead use your money to buy Airbag/how am I driving, which is the B-sides to O.K. computer and the only worthy album held against O.K. computer."
2,Cute Kills,"Okay, after listening to this CD in its entirety, I know the melody that was in Jason Lytle's head when he recorded this. Sometimes heavier on the Radiohead, other times more on the E.L.O. (remember them, kids?), but always more or less the same.So, consider this CD ""variations on a theme by Jason Lytle"". Well at least it's a cute, hummable tune. And it's comforting, like wearing your favorite sweater. Over and over again. Until your friends don't want to be seen with you anymore because they're tired of seeing you in that sweater. They secretly (or aloud, depending on your friends' tact) wonder if you sleep in it at night. Under the weeping willow tree. Eventually, Broken Household Appliance forest animals come to live in that sweater. Soon you won't recognize that sweater from the Dial-A-View. And you'll be sick of it. You gotta get ow-ut of heeeere, you gotta get ow-ut of heeeere..."
5,a healthy addiction,"so beautiful, it hurts...and definitely one of those cds that becomes an obsession the more you listen to it...its certainly mellow, but would NEVER put you to sleep...when you're listening to something that great, sleeping would be like a punishment"
5,some of the best contemporary music,"This is music filled with harmonies and melodies from other worlds, where dreams are king and life takes on magical proportions.Music can be fun, stimulating, amusing and moving: the evidence is happily and thoroughly provided on contemporary works like this.Grandaddy rocks with musical treasures that soothe the soul and bring bliss to hearts. Cannot wait to see them live."
4,A melancholy masterpiece,"Don't be put off by the Radiohead comparisons. The only link i can see between the two bands is the extremely tenuous one that both Sophtware Slump and OK Computer have lyrical references to technology. Radiohead, while admittedly being wonderful, often come across as being aloof, whiny and pretentious, Grandaddy never do.Software Slump is a magnificently melodic journey through a rusty wreckage of malfucntioning technology and alcohol soaked loneliness. Songs like miner at the dial a view and jed the humanoid are incredibly poignant and touching, with wistful melodies to compliment the evocative lyrics.Grandaddy are a special band and this record is a treasure. Heartily recommended."
5,The Consumer Slump,"It's so sad to think that an album of this caliber will get heard by a half dozen people. The fact of the matter is is that this will be one of, if not the best album of the year. It's an absolutely beautiful piece of work that demands repeated listenings. There really isn't much point in signalling out any tracks as they're all brilliant. It makes all that KROQ stuff look really stupid!"
1,Isn't DVD but VHS tape transferred onto DVD and selling them under DVD quality.,It isn't DVD quality. VHS tape simply transferred onto DVD and selling it as DVD. Buy tape cheaper and do the transfer by yourself!
2,Pretty silly,This is a pretty silly computer animated movie for kids. Don't expect anything too spectacular from this movie. It's fairly disjointed and jumps around a lot.
5,HP Jornada 568 - Excellent!,"After returning a Sony Clie (with Palm OS), I purchased the Jornada 568 and have not looked back. The Jornada basically fulfills the desire I've had for some kind of portable computer. I never really wanted to lug around a laptop, so the Pocket PC is just the right size. There are TONS of applications to download for it and it has some very useful features:- Removable battery. You are able to buy spare batteries and swap them at any time (a smaller backup battery saves your data while you perform the swap).- Compact Flash card slot. I already had several CF cards that I wasn't using in my Canon digital camera anymore (after buying the Microdrive), so I was able to add a significant amount of storage memory by using these cards with the 568.- Nice flip-up lid protects the screen from scratches and damage. Plus, the Jornada simply looks sleek and compact.Highly recommended."
1,DeadBook,"Sorry, Greg sold out on this book, probably his last. He uses the reader to lure us into dramatic traps that turn out to be a bad experience. No one likes to read this much negativity. The previous books of his always had a great, suspensful and enticing ending, this one will just [make you mad], in the end. It certainly has less cycling in it than the others and reads as though Moody is sick of the series and just wants to end the book."
1,Waste of Time,"What a waste of time. The ending is completely stupid--a total abdication by the author of his responisibility to the reader to bring the story to an interesting and satisfying ending. Of course that's not surprising given the complete lack of plausible connection between the hero and the villain. There are some hints as to why the bad guy is bad, but absolutely none of the detail that makes the serial killer novel an interesting gendre. I read Derailleur and really enjoyed it--stayed up until 2am to finish--but this book is not in the same class. Of course it does leave open the possibility of a sequel where all of my concerns may be addressed...."
5,The Best Real Ghost Stories Ever!,"I can't tell you how much I thoroughly enjoyed reading this collection of intriguing experiences and stories. Besides the stories the appendixes alone are quite interesting.For the reviewer who rated this 'Two Stars,' I can only say, stick with comic books so you won't have to strain your small intellect. I agree with the ""Library Journal's,"" outstanding review and that's why I purchased Real Ghosts, Restless Spirits, and Haunted Places it. I wasn't disappointed and you'll love this book also."
4,Question,I notice that the Amittyville house is on the cover. Does the author make note of the fact that the Lutz's admitted that they perpetrated a hoax and made up all of the stories about being haunted?That won't stop me from reading the book--it looks facsinating!
2,Not what I expected,"This final book of a great series was not anything like I expected. The first part of the book doesn't even take place in Appalachia, and key characters from previous books aren't even mentioned. It is still an uplifting story, but I felt that the final book could have been much better."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this sander to replace a completely worn out Porter-Cable Speedbloc Sander. While it does the job, I'm not real pleased with this unit. Although it is light and has a dust collection bag (a very nice feature), it also feels bulky and just doesn't have the same power as the Porter-Cable unit. As stated in another review, paper loading is also somewhat of a pain."
5,A cultural and social overview,"What is it about blogging that inspires millions to commit their feelings to a public place? The author of Dispatches from Blogistan : A Travel Guide for the Modern Blogger is a technology journalist and media pioneer who here surveys the culture of blogs, reviews its tools and design features, and considers related issues of privacy, trust, and safeguards on the Net. While it's a cultural and social overview, it also provides novice bloggers with plenty of facts about the online self-publishing revolution - and the hot topic will prove popular not only for computer libraries, but for general-interest holdings and college collections interested in the culture of the Internet.Diane C.

2,Horn loaded and sounds like it.,"These speakers are very efficient and can be driven with a 20 watt amp. The reason they're so efficient is the horn mid-range and tweeter. They sound like they're shouting at you. The bass is ill defined and I just could not get these speakers to sound good. I'd keep looking. Maybe it's just me, but I just do not like the sound of Klipsch speakers. From Klipschhorns to La Scallas, the horn loaded system just does nothing for me and I've been an audiophile for 35 years. If you want to use a low powered single ended class A tube amp, these may work for you. Otherwise try B&W. Even their bookshelf models will sound better."
2,INFERIOR BUILD QUALITY,"I had a pair years ago, sounded great and built like a tank with Birch Plywood, Just got a pair and they are half the speaker they used to be, i.e. they still sound great, but they are built like crap using MDF and glue guns. Save your money and buy a speaker from a company that cares about build quality as much as they do sound. Also, dont buy the excuses that they use high quality MDF and it has tighter tolerances,better resins, blah-blah, crap material is crap material."
2,Agree with others...but my daughter still loves to play with it...,"I agree with the previous reviewers about this toy falling apart ALL the time. However, I have to be honest and say, despite all it's flaws, my 4 year old still loves to play with it daily. It does come with accessories and furniture, which are cool. But the clothes that it comes with are the kind with the magnet (and we bought it post recall)...not the 'rubbery' kind that all of the other Polly Pocket Sets we have are. I say, if you're going to buy it, use the Mattel $5 off any Polly Pocket coupon (expires 12/31/07 I believe) and buy it at a store and at least save yourself some dough..."
2,Won't stay together,"The back end wouldn't stay closed, the side cover was hard to attach, the bed canopy and backdrop kept popping off! I hate it , but my 4 1/2 yr old still likes it."
2,Broke quite quickly,My daughter LOVED this gift - and played with it until the doors broke off. It is not very durable... so was a shame that it is consigned to all our other (airplane) broken polly sets. I wish they were made of stronger stuff!
1,Junk!,Save your money! This is a piece of junk! The parts do not stay together & my kids are constantly asking me to snap the plastic parts back on. Very frustrating!
2,More trouble than it's worth...,Wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this as a Hanukkah gift for my 7 year old daughter. The thing is nearly impossible to put together and it simply doesn't stay together -- pieces constantly fall off. You can imagine the frustration of a child trying to play with this. It's simply poor quality and a disappointment since Polly Pocket is such a popular toy among the elementary school crowd. My recommendation...spend your money elsewhere.
3,A better apron bib else where,I bought this apron and a couple others at Amazon and ended up returning all of them. On this model the neck is somewhat uncomfortable and the snap kind of cheap.I ended up going to Sears where they have either the waist double row apron and bib apron made out of heavy cotton canvas for $5.99.
3,"OK, not great","Pockets are adequate, but strap going over the neck is really irritating. I solved it by wrapping a rag around the strap, but if apron had wider strap, or better yet if strap didn't go over back of neck, I would like it a lot more."
4,Blue Crane's Canon 20D Video is Good Value,"If you find watching a video with clear on-screen illustrations of the camera's various features - than this is well worth the price. Having decided on Canon 20D SLR, I wanted to get quickly familiar with its many options. Thus I bought this video BEFORE I took delivery of the camera. Since then I have gone back to refresh on one or two points. It is far easier to read the manual after watching the video. If you already have extensive experience with another digital SLR (point-and-shoot does not count), than you may be able to skip this without too much loss. Otherwise - money well spent. The only reason I did not give it five stars --- I was greedy and wanted even more advanced material. But it is a very good value."
1,Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway and To The Lighthouse,"This is a guide to understanding the two books by Virginia Woolf, it does not contain Woolf's novels. This book is by Martin D. Levenson for ""Monarch Notes"". It's kind of like Cliff's notes."
1,DO NOT ORDER -- THEY WILL SEND YOU ONLY ONE BALL NOT A DOZEN!!!!,"My review is not based on the baseball itself but on the fact that I received only ONE ball, not a dozen. I contacted Amazon and they re-submitted the order and assured me that it would be a dozen balls, but again only ONE ball. I ended up returning the ball(s) for a refund -- VERY frustrating!!! Amazon's only explanation was that ""there must be an inventory issue with this item"". No kidding.I was looking for a nice dozen baseball for my son that had leather, not synthetic covers. There were many to choose from on Amazon but ALMOST ALL of the others had at least one negative review that they had received only one ball, not a dozen. I ordered this particular ball since there were no such complaints, and the fact that it is fulfilled by Amazon and not a third party vendor. My precautions did me no good.You are better off just going to Dick's or Sports Authority to buy your baseballs."
2,"Juvenile, but fast read","Fast moving, but plot is juvenile and predictive. Seems like this was thrown together quickly. Even the text had numerous typos."
3,A Brother hood of Outlaws,"This book was.......something to read. Nothing more.The number of grammar and spelling errors was enough to make your head ache. Obviously ""spell check"" was the exclusive means of editing, because a great number of words were used in improper context.The storyline is like so may others written since the resurgance of the motorcycling fenom. It's writing proclaims of the author ""look at ME, and all that I have seen and done!"" ""I've been everywhere but the electric chair, and seen everything but the wind!"" I am biker, hear me roar.....etc. etc.Not a terrible reading experience, but tiresome after having read better books on the subject such as Under and Alone, No Angel, Hell's Angel.Maybe the biker boy re-run would have earned back points if it were more carefully edited and typewritten.In the author's defense, this writing still leaves me envious of ""the life"" and those who live it.Ride hard Bob!"
1,Garbage,"Truthfully it does not use much of your resources and it tells you have an infection. Problems is you have a virus too, twice now it told me I was infected and that I had a virus. Customer service is slow and the advice has been useless. I paid to have the software block viruses not tell me I have them now.. Did as I was told and the virus was still there because of a cookie that downloaded the virus again. Downloaded Norton trail version and it's all gone as was this program off my computer.. This product was less expensive but the amount of productivity I lost was not.. That old saying applies here ""cheap is expensive"".."
4,A wonderful recording.,A really nice recording overall. Intonation is very good. One of the most overlooked Russian Violinist.
5,Soundtrack to my childhood,"Like so many others, I bought this CD because is reminded me of all the cartoons from my childhood- when cartoons were worth getting up at 7am on a Saturday morning to see. Great CD. It is unfortunate that it is OOP now, and therefore can cost a pretty penny."
1,good tape but mislead here,this album is actually very good and some great music but i am giving it one star cause no one has the audio cassette when you order it they cheat you and send you the cd instead so make sure you email people who are selling this before you order the audio cassette
1,not worth the hassle!,"We bought this one because we were over seas and accidently plugged the 64 into a 240 volt outlet (woops!) Any way this one was cheaper, but now we wished we had went ahead and paid the money! The connection to the back of the system never fit snuggley so if you moved it, it would disconnect, then you would have to mess around with it to get it to work again! Then it would heat up like crazy, i mean really hot!! And now.. it doesn't work, so we're buying the real thing this time!"
4,Delicious and Authentic,Well designed and categorized by ethnicity. Nicely illustrated with a variety of easy yet authentic recipes. I originally borrowed it from the local library and liked it so much I decided I had to have it for my own.
5,Tasty and Spicy,"There are so many amazing recipes in this book - it will keep your taste buds on a roller coaster of spice blends from around the world. I find myself not only reaching for this book for dinner parties, but adding spice blends from this book into other dishes. Pick-up a copy, it will open up the world of cuisine."
3,"nice book but tell me what is in it as well, maybe I may buy it",Nice price and cover design but it lacks one very important thing that a book write up needs to sell that particular book is more information as to the contents of the book
3,Very good! But...,"This book is wonderful. It teaches all sorts of different spiritualities, the levels of them, progression etc... though in my opinion it heavily lacks more interactive and inspiring ways to make progress spiritually. Sure there are a lot of questions offered to ask yourself but there aren't as many activities. I feel like it spent too much time explaining and analyzing the types of spirituality from a general perspective than getting right to PAGAN spirituality and ideas of how to progress your own."
5,Durable and good quality,"This bag is very durable and quality made. The compartments are very useful and the hard bottom is good for protecting the equipment in the bottom section. It isn't the biggest bag, so you will have trouble fitting bigger tools and maybe difficulty fitting in drills along with your other tools, but for hand tools, this bag works great. The inner walls of the bag are lined with small tool holders... small thin objects fit well such as screw drivers, pens, utility knives, etc. I would recommend this bag if you carry a lot of hand tools and need a smaller bag."
4,Good experience,Part was of good quality. Perfect replacement and was shipped quickly. A good experience and would use again if needed!
5,Best travel guide for Barcelona,"I've had the pleasure of spending nearly three weeks in Barcelona on three different trips now (total of 19 days). Each morning I toss this little jewel into my purse or daypack and leave any other guides I've brought with me in the hotel. The book is fabulous if you only have a couple of days to spend there, but is also very useful for repeat visits (I'm just now coming to the end of this little guide's usefulness). Don't leave home without it (or its newer replacement) if you're traveling to marvelous Barcelona."
1,Dumbest Book We've Ever Seen,"I would give this 0 stars if I could. A total waste of time, paper, ink, etc. I just completed the form to return this to Amazon.I bought this book as a Christmas present for my wife based on the 5 '5 star' reviews seen here previously. When I received it, I almost didn't give it to her because I thought it was so dumb. But I thought perhaps I just didn't 'get it' and gave it to her anyway. Turns out I should have gone with my instinct--she hated it too. Just a bunch of pages with a random picture and a random line out of context--not funny, interesting, or thought-provoking in any way."
3,I asked for and received this item as a gift. It's a very nicely presented,"Sumi-E painting set. I would call it more of a traveling kit because it is so small. I had never tried sumi-e before, and now that I have started, I realize it is easier to do with a much larger, thicker brush than the ones provided in this kit. Also, though grinding the ink is interesting in a meditative, old world sort of way, using black watercolor paint is quicker and easier. Still, I like the way this set is made, and it does make a lovely gift. As for the seller, shipping, et al, it was A+ all the way."
3,Brush caligraphy set,This item is much small than anticipated but includes everything pictured. The box is beautiful and it will make a nice gift.
2,"LOW CARB, BUT HIGH FAT!","This review is aimed toward you health-conscious vegetarians out there. This cookbook is none other than the way vegetarians USED to eat: lots of eggs, dairy, and eggplant! To sum it up, I did an approximate breakdown of the 150 recipes: 12 contain eggplant; 20 mushrooms; 25 zucchini/squash; 21 beans; 23 eggs; 90 DAIRY! (We all know that the fats in dairy products are the WORST kind.) And for you carb counters there's a whopping 62 recipes containing Idaho potatoes, rice, pasta, or bread products! (""Toast"" and tortillas are common meal accompaniments.)We also see a tremendous amount of repeated ingredients here, and recipes that have run the vegetarian gamut for years - nothing new and innovative.That said, there are a few ""tasty"" options, yet those don't justify buying this cookbook."
2,Waste of Money,The little extras - like the clouds just fall off. It's not put together well at all. The jewlery is super junky.The pony is cute. I don't even think this is worth the $7.50 it is now!
4,daughter loves My Little Pony,"My daughter loves the My Little Pony collection, so this is a nice addition to what she already has. It's very fun to open the doors with the magnet on the pony's foot. However, if you're looking at this toy as a jewelry box, there really isn't a lot of space for jewelry. Nevertheless, my daughter is happy with it."
2,Sensor?,"It's a good idea but I still haven't figure out how the sensors work. I tried moving my hands around it and it wouldn't light up but for whatever reason, it would light up when my cat is walking. The light is pretty bright but I feel that it's a bit heavy so it's now a keychain. By the way, Premier Glo kitty collar has the best glow in the dark collars! I can even see the glow in my house during daytime."
2,Quickly breaks from collar,I want to like this ID tag. Unfortunately the plastic ring which attaches to the chain is too fragile. It breaks and the tag ends up on the ground.
4,"fun item, heavy for little dog","This is a really cute product. I like being able to see where my dog is when she goes out at night. It stops blinking when she stops, so that is a bit of a negative, I wish it kept blinking. On a little dog, it needs to be attached on their back or it will hang too low to the ground and drag. It pulls my little wiener dog's harness to the side from the weight. It seems to be of good quality, not flimsy."
1,Safe t tag does not work,"Our dog is deaf so we really like having the lighted Safe t tag so we can find her at night in the back yard. We order these regularly, but for the last two times, the tags have been defective. They turn out when fresh out of the package, and then that is it. After that they neither light or blink. So, these are a big waste of money."
3,Motion Activation is Problem,"These flashing tags are great except for the motion sensor. When the dog stops, it stops flashing. Dangerous if the dog is standing in the street or driveway, etc. Sentry brand has one without the sensor and it costs less. I found them at Bed Bath and Beyond for $2.99"
1,They fall off and get lost,"I have lost four of these within a month. The clasp separates from device and once the LED falls down in the brush it stops blinking and it's lost forever. If you remove the clasp and attach the LED to the dogs collar using the plastic tab, the plastic tab breaks and the LED falls off once again. I haven't give up on these yet, I'm going try two more of these, one more time, this time I'll be using tyrap's to hold the device on. I'll use the tyrap around the body of the device and attach that too the dogs collar. When they work and don't fall off, they do work well."
3,Motion Sensor is Problem on Dog Tag,"These flashing tags are great except for the motion sensor. When the dog stops, it stops flashing. Dangerous if the dog is standing in the street or driveway, etc. Sentry brand has one without the sensor and it costs less. I found them at Bed Bath and Beyond for $2.99"
5,Elegant Little Lady...,"This is a beautiful Papo figure that is even better ""in person"" than in the image on this page. She stands very well by herself; she makes a wonderful little figure for a little girl's room. Her face is very gentle. She is appropriate for storytelling, fantasy, and medieval displays."
2,Not quite universal....,"I had to buy several extra mounting pieces to use this ""universal"" bike rack. Mybike does not have pre-drilled holes and the brackets provided for this purpose were too small.I had to get larger brackets or buy a center mount option (or so their customer service told me).I also had a problem with the bolt size not fitting the threads on my bike where thebottom mounts are. Wow...I have a run of the mill, standard bike...maybe this is morefor those dedicated cyclists with a certain type of bike. This only worked with another$12 worth of investment! Sheesh...thanks a lot!"
2,Banging my feet!,"Paid about $25 from REI and will have to return. Not easy to install on my GT mountain bike and sits so close to my tire that my feet bang into my bags constantly. There is no way to adjust it any further and took some serious rigging just to get it to attach. It does seem sturdy but if I have to return it, I think it says it all."
5,Excellent Book,"This is a wonderful book on the Gifts of the Holy Spirit. Harold Horton writes from the depths of his experiences with Howard Carter, who came out of the Pentecostal Revivals of early 1900s. Horton gives an accurate and detailed analysis of 1 Corinthians 12, 13 and 14. There are chapters on each of the gifts of chapter 12. Horton makes no apologies for returning to the true supernatural impact of the Holy Spirit. This is the power of the Spirit at work in the believer today - he gives no weight to man's attempts to make the things of the Spirit into mere human derivatives.Written in 1934 and republished continuously for 60 years, this is a modern classic. It is refreshing to go back a few generations to be reinspired by some core teaching on one of the essentials foundations of a life of faith."
5,Gifts of the Spirit by Harold Horton,An excellent resource for teaching. Current teschers have abandoned the classical Pentecostal approach to Systemaric Theology and Pneumatology. I prefer some of the older resources that have not been compromised with the trend to modernism.
3,Breeding Pedigreed Cats,"The book itself is in excellent condition with a price very reasonable. The content is professionally written, although some is outdated and I don't think that internet access was available at the time of it's publication. The principles remain the same and there is valuable, having been experienced, information."
5,"Believe me, black angels exist... They are called THE FOUR TOPS!","When I die, I hope God will be so merciful with me that if my soul gets to be accepted in Heaven, it will be received with the overwhelming sound of ""Reach Out I'll Be There"" by the Four Tops... These guys are simply, AWESOME singers!!!If you're a serious Soul/Vocal groups fan, this CD is a 'Must Have' in your collection... Play it everywhere, anytime... You'll really fall in love with the voice work of these guys!"
3,Not so hot,"To me, there is NO excuse for having these recordings in mono. While it is true that some of the Motown material did no collapse right & sounded better in mono, The Four Tops recordings always lent themselves well to the stereo recordings. Shame on Hipp-O!!!"
1,missing book,Not deliverable at this address This is the 2nd time I order to this address and it is not being delivered.
5,GREAT RESOURCE,"If you are at all concerned about toxic ingredients in your foods, this is the ingredient bible! A must have!"
1,"Too narrow, not enough health information","I was very disappointed when I received this book. I was hoping for something that would arm me with knowledge and enable me to make truly smart choices when reviewing the ingredients on packages. However, what I got was a very narrow, ""FDA approved"" listing of the uses and possible side effects of many ingredients. I have always been a label reader and I have done research on many chemicals and additives and know that there are 1000s of KNOWN carcinogens, mood destabilizers, & biological disrupters that are in our food and household products. But, when I looked them up in this book it would say something like : ""used mostly as an artificial sweetener."" Duh. Thanks. Now could you please tell me what it does to the human body?I promptly returned the book. You can find less ""censored"" info with some research on the internet."
2,MISSES THE MARK,"Like the author I am also dying and was looking for some inspiration and to what and how I should tell my ten year old daughter. I was hoping for the author to write words of guidance and inspiration to HIS daughter, as he might not be around when she had her first date, learn to drive a car, graduated high school, or college. I was hoping he would write her something for when she got married, had a baby, or even divorced. But sadly this book was all about him. Today I'm feeling fine but... Today I feel bad but... Poor poor me all the way through the book, with a very rare ""I love you daughter"" thrown in. Simply put, I feel cheated."
2,Good for Beginners,"""Marvelous Murals You can Paint"" is a good book for beginners in that it explains very basic techniques and materials. Line drawings and coloring book-type children's murals are illustrated. A very simplified way to do clouds with spray paint is demonstrated. If you're looking for realism or professional techniques, you will be disppointed with this book. The gallery is inspiring, with beautiful photos of wonderful wall treatments, none of which are explained or demonstrated. Shows a couple of basic landscape-type murals with good stone and wood effects."
2,Something's missing,"I purchased this book in the hope that it would provide instruction to create the murals illustrated on the first few pages. Unfortunately, although there are very beautiful murals pictured,instructions are included for only a few. Perhaps my tastes differ from the authors but it seems that most garish and ugly murals were the ones that included ""how to"" instructions. It leads one to wonder if perhaps they do not want any competition in producing the more tasteful murals pictured! I also purchased the companion video and was disappointed for the same reasons- the instructions were only for projects I would not want to do."
3,Amatuers beware,"I think Gary Lord does wonderful work and these murals are amazing. However, unless you are an artist or have invested in some equipment, this isn't for you. It has great ideas that one might hire done."
3,Truly okay,"The murals described here require a moderate level of artistic talent to even make a good knock off of. It is good enough, but if you are already talented enough to replicate the ideas herein, you have enough talent that you don't need the book."
3,I like gary's new books better,"this is an older book and the work simplistic I prefer his latest 3 books:The House That Faux Built,Its Faux Easy With Gary Lordand his latest mural book just coming out"
3,something better,Although this book was visually nice to look at I found it lacked in teaching me how to paint murals. I have stumbled across a great site that has free tutorials on it. The site is [...] I hope you find this helpful.
5,The Most Informative Book About Jews!,"I had received this book from two people, one from a very good friend of my father's, and once from a good friend of mine. I had used this as a resource for research projects in my middle school and in my Hebrew High School as well. This book has information about many well known, and not so well known Jewish events. It starts in 2500BCE with The Migration of The Patriarchs and goes all the way to Modern Israel in the 1990s. This book has many diagrams, photographs, and paragraphs explaining how the Jews were always everywhere in a hidden or obvious way. This would be an excellent gift for a bar mitzvah (when I had gotten it twice), bat mitzvah, birthday or any occassion for that matter. It is as well an excellent book to have as reference. I strongly suggest this book to any one wishing to find information about Jews playing an influence in the world."
2,Very non Religious views,"Though the content of this book maybe very interesting and thorough, the ideas are presented in a very non religious fashion and contain a very secular approach to Jewish history. So beware to the religious reader."
4,Great rake if installed propperly,"I've had the Delta Post Porter for 2 years and have had loaded to the max for commuting, mountain biking, and touring. I have never had a problem with the rack not staying put. But the trick is to take an old inner tube and cut a piece off to use as a shim. Then tighten the screws down in opposite sides. I haven't used large size panniers yet, but my large trunk back with drop down panniers works great on the rack.My only complaint is that the rack sits higher than standard racks which causes the weight to sit higher which effects stability. However, if a stem mounted rack is only option, it's something to keep in mind.I prefer this rack to the quick release rack because the screw mount is more of a deterrent to theft than a quick release. But I still loop my cable lock through the pannier supports, tire, seat hole, and frame."
3,Good For the Money But Can't Carry Much,"This is a decent rack for the price and would serve lightweight use on a mountain bike that has no supports for a normal rack...BUT...be advised that two things will happen, one probably correctable and one not.1. The rack may shift around with weight on it, no matter how tight you dare to make it. Some kind of non-slip material needs to go inside the clamp (I don't have the quick release type, but the bolt-on type)2. If you use panniers large enough to accept a grocery bag, the bag *will* slam against your tires and spokes, because the pannier supports are too flexible (you get what you pay for). But if you are just stuffing panniers with clothing or other light items, no problems.I ended up putting this one up for sale and bought a ""mountain man"" rack, which is 3X the price and 3X stronger, and does not flex because it can mount to the axle, with extensions."
3,Couple of Design Flaws,"I found it very important to cut up an old inner tube to use as a sleeve to keep the rack in place. The manufacturer should have included a rubber spacer. Also the bolts screw into the aluminum rack and are therefore prone to stripping. They should have seated a nut to prevent this issue. I have to set the grocery panniers as far forward on the rack as possible to keep them from rubbing the wheels as the rack sways. If you have a bike with rear suspension, either get a new bike or this rack. If you have a hardtail bike, go with a conventional rack."
3,Didn't hold the weight it was said to hold,It kept sliding down the post and banging on parts of the bike. My son was so discouraged he didn't even want to try the rubber wrap under the grip I have read is necessary. If it is necessary why don't they provide one instead of making you cut up a tire or something? We sold it on ebay at a loss.
4,"Whatever you look like, you're still you....","Whatever you look like, you're still you.... In a world which has less and less time for those of us who are not 'perfect', this book reminds us in trenchant and pared english that we are still what we are, however much we change ourselves...It's also funny and informative about the world of the body builder and a really involving story. I wanted to know what was going to happen next and kept turning the pages."
4,Bizarre World of Body Building,"This is an interesting novel about bizarre people who are into body building. Ultimately, it is a novel of hope not yet realized, goals not yet achieved, cruelty and despair.Many of the characters are caricatures which seemed racist to me. I wasn't sure if this was intentional for shock value or if their was an underlying racism inherent in the writing."
4,Entertaining..,"Our three year old is really inrigued by this Winnie The Pooh ""Laptop"". We laugh as he totes it EVERYWHERE we go. It is something he will be able to use for a couple of years with the different skill levels that came with it.Overall it is a nice product that entertains the curious mind of our three year old."
4,Good fun!,I purchased this for my neice and she hasn't put it down since! She loves the voices and the stories that it tells while she's learning.
5,One of the Best Books I've Ever Read,"I read this book last year, and it was outstanding. This book is about Anna O'Dell and her two younger siblings, Mandy and Casey who are abandoned by their alcoholic mother. Since her father is dead, Anna soon assumes the role of a mother and finds out how hard it really is to be a parent, especially at the age of 15.I highly recommend this book to anyone. When I read it, I couldn't put it down. I read this book in school with some of my friends as a group, and we all loved it. Some of them even cried. It is touching and very realistic, and you will be sad when it ends, because you won't want it to end."
5,Fun loving music,This CD shows the best of Brazillina music. Cool rithm with well done harmony along with nice melodies. Everything well executed and played by Brazil's best musicians..
2,Very ordinary advice on business management,"I was looking for a book that describes how Chinese culture and government cause business in China to work differently from U.S. business. This book fails to provide any insights of this nature.It is merely a standard set of plausible but not very original sounding recommendations for how to run a business. It happens to use Chinese businesses to illustrate its points, but it would sound virtually the same if it used U.S. businesses as examples instead."
3,Reads like Bobbie Kristina....,"I would highly recommend this for teens, it's a very good read! Ms. Thomas did an amazing job with ""Simply Divine""!In my personal opinion, it sounds like a calmer version of what I would imagin Bobbie Kristina's life to be like! Take a little bit off her, add a little bit there, and WOW! Being Bobbie Kris...I have to say that I did enjoy it though! Great job Ms. Thomas!"
5,Drama,"So many things happen in this book. Babies, arrest, death, drugs, new lives, old lives, music, movies, love, kissing, church, savior... murder. You won't guess what happens next."
4,"An excellent book, a complete look at loyalty marketing.","The one thing this book cannot do for you is make top management, from the CEO to the regional and divisional managers, get on board your program. Unless someone lays down the line, and goes with the book's recommendation to transform the company to work along loyalty marketing lines, the only thing that will come out of such a hobbled frequent shopper program is an expensive toy.Been there, done that.You need three things to make your FSP system work, total management dedication, the people who can put together a hardware/software combination that is actually functional enough to do the job, and the recommendations of this book."
2,Not for everyone,"Neither me or my wife liked this on anything we tried it on. I do have many of Steven's items, and i do like the steak rub though."
4,Eros mejora su calidad,"Est disco es fant√°stico, sobre todo para los fieles seguidores del cantante, que en su √∫ltimo trabajo discogr√°fico en espa√±ol nos muestra su ascenso. Con letras m√°s elaboradas y una m√∫sica de mucha mayor calidad que en sus trabajos anteriores, ""Estilo libre"" es uno de los mejores discos de Eros, solo superable por aquellas canciones de principio de su carrera que hicieron historia en la m√∫sica hispana."
4,Over-The-Head Headphones,"Wearing ear buds for an extended length of time causes my ears to ache. I selected these headphones for use where great audio performance isn't a necessity - primarily for watching movies and television programs on my laptop. I don't disturb those near me and the cushy ear pad keeps my outer ear pain-free.Because of the low price I wasn't expecting much but the sound quality is quite good - not great - tonally muddy in places - but dialog is quite clear. I wouldn't listen to music with this pair and expect great performance. But, they are great to throw in my bag with the laptop and tote them around without concern. Not as compact as ear buds, but also not as fragile.I've been using them for a few months, and am pleasantly surprised. They do the job better than expected and are holding-up well to my less than careful handling and are comfortable on my very average-sized head."
2,Too large,Although it is adjustable at its smallest it is still too large for my head. As a consequence the on-ear part only comes half way my ear. Surprised to read other reviewers say it fits well since my head is not particularly small. Also the padding is thin so this headphone started to hurt my ears rather quickly.
1,"Well, they USED to be funny","These two used to be funny. What happened?I picked up On the Rocks, and Back With a Vengeance, and watched them back to back. Now, I wish I hadn't. The girls simply aren't funny anymore. It was painful watching them try to relive their glory years. Sorry, they've passed.There is only one funny moment on the whole dvd, and that doesn't happen until the ""bonus features"" (naturally, the bonus is longer than the feature), and it's not worth the retail price of this.Even hard-core F&S; addicts (raising hand) will regret these lame dvds.Stick with the Vic or AbFab dvds instead."
3,One of Their Best,"F&S; seem to appeal to a specific audience. There's some British comedy that just doesn't translate well for Americans. A lot of this has to do with the fact that we in America just aren't aware of many of the things they're parodying. That French & Saunders manage to make these things funny anyway is rather amazing.I must disagree that this series isn't as good as the previous ones. Frankly, I thought their earlier series were absolutely unfunny and I couldn't fathom how one could find them so. This and On the Rocks are hilarious and I would recommend them over all their other series. Especially worth watching would be the Titanic parody (Saunders's AbFab co-star Joanna Lumley guests on that) in On the Rocks, and the Cold Mountain ""DVD commentary"" in Back With a Vengeance. Oh, and Dawn French's Catherine Zeta-Jones impression is wickedly funny.French and Saunders are some of the funniest women in Britain! Watch their shows!"
5,Are You Ready To Laugh?,"First of all, only purchase this DVD if you're prepared to laugh until it hurts! This duo compliment one another so well and each scene is acted with such ease. This fun, fake behind-the-scenes look at the making of their show will is a new style for the pair. There are also numerous other skits along with this. Of those I've picked the top 3 (drum roll please!):1. The Cold Turky skit (a play on 'Cold Mountain')2. The Two Retirees In Florida skit3. The Visit To The Doctor's OfficeLike I said, this is an excellent DVD, worthy of every penny!!!"
2,Too close to the topic ...,"I am a huge fan of these guys but this DVD is just not up to par with their others. Much of this video is not comedy at all. It is French and Saunders hanging around the BBC office trying to come up with a skit that will work for their new producer. The majority of the film occurs there and they don't ever come up with the comedy routine. I love their work and have howled at all the others in this series, but this one misses the mark. I think part of the problem might be that it relies on humor best understood by people who are actually involved in network comedy. Their experiences with and knowledge of the industry allows them to see humor where the average person does not. Buy ON THE ROCKS instead...you won't regret it!"
5,"Jane Olivor, Love Decides","She's Back! Received my new Jane Olivor CD, Love Decides, yesterday. It has played continuously ever since! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jane... We have so missed you! Her voice is richer, if that is possible, and has the same emotional quality that drew me to her so many years ago. You can feel every emotion in each note. That's what has been missing for so long...true emotion in music. I play the earlier cds all the time...I also have the albums and tapes. You know I'm a fan if I watch Same Time Next Year to hear the long version of the theme song! Now I have 11 new favorite songs! If you think you might want this cd...don't hesitate..buy two today and send one to a friend! I hope to see Jane in Concert here in Atlanta....soon!"
5,Welcome Back,"Jane Olivor has been sorely missed. It is a thrill to have her recording again. This come back CD does not disappoint at all. In fact if anything her voice is richer and the songs here are so well done. It gave me goosebumps to listen to it. I was very surprised to find that she chose the song Half Heaven, Half Heartache - previously recorded by Gene Pitney - and to also notice that he sang harmony on this version with her. What a thrill to know that he is also still around and recording."
5,Love Decided! Finally!,"O.K., I may not be the most objective reviewer when it comes to Jane Olivor, I think she could sing the phone book and I'd be happy! I am so excited about this new CD. After 18 years her voice is still like crystal,the arrangements are lovely and no one chooses songs the way Jane does. I was especially touched by ""I Had This Man"" because it is such a personal story. All of Jane's songs feel personal, however. She sings with such tenderness and intimacy. If you've never heard her, do yourself a favor and listen. There is nothing out there that can compare to her music. Thank you for this wonderful gift Jane, I have missed you terribly."
4,Great singer; good songs,"One of the most beautiful lines in pop music is Jane Olivor's rendering of ""ragged men in ragged clothes, a silver thorn, a bloody rose"" from ""Vincent"" on her first recording. She has a way of saying words and lines which make them memorable.After a long absence from recording, Jane's voice is as good as ever. She doesn't shriek or shout, she just sings. And nobody sounds better. She is at her best accompanied by a strong piano and a hint of other instruments in the background. You don't want to drown her out with a lot of superfluous noise.The only reason she doesn't get 5 stars is that, in my view, none of the songs on this CD is truly outstanding. There's no song here up to ""Chasing Rainbows"" or ""Some Enchanted Evening"" or ""Chariots of Fire"" on her early CDs. But I'd still much rather listen to Jane that the so-called divas such as Barbra Steisand, Whitney Houston, and Celine Dion."
4,Not what I was hoping for.,"This is a book full of interesting information-- no question there. However, it's not super reader-friendly and I just couldn't get into it. I wanted a random-information book I could read straight through-- this isn't it. However, it is a pretty cool book-- maybe a nice coffee table book addition."
2,Washington State Wine Propaganda,"Kind of a rip off. Washington state should just provide this for free because of the degree of hyping up the state and wine region. It leaves me with the taste that if WA wants to sell a travel brochure, I wonder what kind of commercialism is in their wine."
4,An intriguing read on iPod and its impact,"Why do people ask for an iPod when they want an MP3 player? Other players hold as many or more songs, and play them just as well. Owning an iPod is more about music than about keeping up with the latest trends. That is why the iPod still holds the top spot in MP3 player sales. Author Steven Levy explores how the iPod came to be and how it earned its status as a cultural icon. Even the book's iPod-looking cover could evoke emotion from an iPod fan. We recommend this book to iPod lovers who will relish its story. Businesspeople, trend spotters and marketers also will gain insight into the way Apple made millions from selling music, machines and coolness."
5,I bought a box of copies and sent 'em to my clients!,"And how's THIS for timing? I read Levy's book on the plane, en route to the massive, mind-boggling, 2007 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.But before I'd even read this book -- and strictly based on its Wall Street Journal review -- I ordered a box of copies and sent 'em to my clients, which are mostly radio stations...because radio stations are in iPod's cross-hairs.If you read Levy's stuff in Newsweek, you already know that THIS GUY CAN WRITE. And he's done something downright poetic, by offering the chapters ""on shuffle."" They're in different order in different copies of the book...and can be read in any order.My two favorite chapters are the one ABOUT shuffle (which, if you own an iPod, WILL deliver you an ""oh wow"" moment); and the chapter recalling how Walkman was received in its day.HIGHLY recommended reading.Holland CookeNews/Talk SpecialistMcVay Media"
2,Boring,"The book boils down to this: Apple is great, Steve Jobs is really great, and the iPod is really really great. The author takes breaks from telling you how awesome the ipod is to kiss Steve Jobs' butt for long periods, digressing at one point into the launch of the iMac and complaining that other books about Jobs aren't complimentary enough. What does this have to do with the iPod? Disappointing."
4,Celestron 100mm 52252,"The optics are very good, with an extremely wide field of view. This is a large scope and has some weight to it - we use it on our deck overlooking our pond. The scope because of it's size and weight requires a ""beefy"" tripod. The zoom is easy to use, find your subject while zoomed out and turn the eyepiece to zoom in. Focus is almost as easy. We have a small problem with the rubber texture at the zoom control it has cracked and will eventually fall off. I am sure that Celestron will supply us with the replacement."
3,You have to want to read it...,"If you are of a scholarly mind, and are willing to invest the brain power necessary to digest this tome, it is a good book. What we have here is a discussion on how being Jewish has affected the artist's, critic's and art historian's perception of Art. My complaint is that it was just too hard to read and understand. I realize that this was intended to be a scholarly dissertation, I felt it would be helpful to my fellow readers to be prepared beforehand for that difficulty"
4,good information,"This was originally available for free on thunderwizard.com. but is now in DVD format. You can buy the DVD from the website or get the electronic version here. It appears to be a bunch of podcasts compiled together.There is some interesting and good information in it. I enjoyed it, and although I thought it was a little pricy, did not regret my purchase. This is a series, and I intend to explore the other titles at a later date."
5,It's good!,I ordered this for my husband and he loves it. It works so much better than a lot of other products we've tried.
4,seedling heat mats,This is my second pruchase of the heat mats. Last season I had very good luck with them and decided to purchase more to be able to start more seedlings this year. The order was placed and shipped within the time frame stated very happy with the purchase.
4,Great for germinating seeds,"I only wish I had ordered more than one of these. One gets you going, but you should have more to keep soil warm after germination if you plant a lot."
5,Works as it States,Helped my seedlings pop up about 7 days ealier than expected. maintains a constant temp.
2,Seedling Heat Mat,"Heat mat puts out a little heat. When they say it raises the temp 10 degreees above ambient temp, that seems to be a max. Would have been better to make a double mat that was one tray wide and 2 long so that you could put two trays under one 4 foot light. Ended up 'wasting' half the mat and would have eeb better off to have bought a single tray mat or even better none at all. Heat from the flourscent light was better that the heat mat."
2,Not up to much,"This heating pad heated the seed bed to about 4 degrees F above the 65 degree room temp, the heat pattern is irregular, even after covering the tray. I sent it back."
5,Great little mats well worth the money,I purchased two of these mats and they fit the normal Jiffy starter sets nicely. A little heat under the warm weather plants really give the seedlings a boost. I noticed a huge difference in size/quality of plants with and without the mat.
5,My Broccoli Plants are Already 2 inches High!,"I planted my Spring seed collection on Sunday morning using the Heat Mat sitting on a layer of foam insulation. I planted tomato's and Broccoli. Well, 2 1/2 days later I took a look under the plastic cover and discovered my broccoli seedlings are already about two inches high!! A few heirloom tomato seeds have popped up as well. I took a temperature reading and the top of the soil is at 80 degrees. Considering the plants are sitting in a 55 degree basement, I'm very impressed."
5,Perfect adjunt to an automatic sprouter,I use this under my automatic sprouter and it makes all the difference. I hook it up to the thermostat and turns my sprouter's environment from wet to steamy. The sprouts didn't grow until I put the heat under them. Now it's like they're in the ideal primeval garden and they grow willy-nilly.
2,worked for two seasons and now dead,"really thought that due to overall time this product was used would last much longer -- I am thinking, 2 years time 90 days times 24 hours, that this product only lasted for 4320 hours or 180 days. This is just 6 months operating time. Are you kidding? I got punked."
5,Works as advertised,"This item is very easy to use,the instructions are part of the mat so there is no fear of losing them. Last winter was so cold, I had difficulty getting vegetable seeds to sprout. Not so this spring.I purchased a thermostat to use with the mat and love it, too."
2,10-20 degrees increase from ambient temperature?,Mine struggles to raise it 5 degrees. . find a better product. . . . . . . . .
4,Works as advertised,"For those who need it, the mat has detailed instructions printed on it.I have noted that some reviews indicated that a bad smell was given off when the pad was heated, ( new), I dont find this to be the case.This product is new to me, but works fine, so far.I use the Hydrofarm MTPRTC Digital Thermostat with this mat."
4,"I works, but it's a pain to unroll","My seed trays stay warm, and I get plenty of germination. The only down side is this goofy thing comes rolled up and just doesn't like to stay flat. I have to use duct tape to keep the corner's down."
5,Brrrr....but that was before...,"I have used this for a season and it worked like a charm. Before the mat: I would set the house to 64 degrees when I wasn't home and at night when I was sleeping. Once I realized at day 8 that my tomato and pepper seeds were not coming up, I figured out why...too cold....duh! I started keeping the house warm and up came the seeds, but oh so late. Anyway, using the mat has allowed the seeds to come up when they should without the rest of the house having to compensate."
5,Works like a charm,I bought this heat mat to get my seeds started inside. Since my apartment is cold and seeds like heat I thought i'd give it a try. Three days after I planted my seeds I had a ton of sprouts. Nearly every seed germinated. If you need some extra warmth to get your seeds going definitly get one of these heat mats.It didn't get too hot and I was able to keep it right on my countertop. My only problem was I should have had a light to put over my seedlings once they sprouted. It's very easy to use as you just plug it in and put your tray on top. The instructions are even written right on the mat itself.
2,not too great,THe mat has uneven heating and doesn't work too well. may be better to just use a hot water bottle to make a warm environment. I got this thing to germinate some tomatoes but it took just as long for them to sprout thatn if i had used nothing.
3,Little disappointed,"It was great to get all three items for a reasonable price, but the thermostat does not work right. You can raise the temperature, but you cannot lower it past a certain point that I want the temperature set."
4,Enhances Any Germination Or Cloning Situation You May Have,"I have a large bay window with a window seat in my kitchen that gets natural light from three sides. In the spring the seat pads get stashed and out comes and insulated mat that covers the surface, this heat mat, and plant tray with fortified planting material for seedlings or plant cuttings. This mat keeps the plant tray warm and encourages rapid growth without doing much more than keeping the plants warm and fed. In a matter of 3-4 days, the plants sprout and show root growth.I like this mat because I get fast and effective results with this every time I use it. It's a good product that pays for itself with its success rate and the fact that it makes me feel like a gardening pro."
5,Just what you wanted.,"The seedling grow mat we had bit the dust. I wanted another, but was concerned that the mat could get too warm if it was as thick as the one we had. I was so pleasantly surprised that the Hydrofarm was so thin! Technology can be so great. The Hydrofarm is like an eighth of an inch thick. We set it up on top of an inverted cardboard box with some rose slips in 4"" pots we wanted to grow. It was in our carport, which is somewhat protected. Even though it got down to 42 degrees one night, the slips were fine--not too hot and not too cold, but just right. I decided that if it got colder than that I would put the mat with the slips IN the box. I may need another mat."
4,seeding Heat Mat,"Really works, but I find it gets to hot if trays are set directly on it. I placed a rack on it and then placed my trays on the racks . I also purchased a thermostat to regulate the heat but, have not tried it yet"
4,Hydrofarm Seedling Heat Mat 9x19,"The mat works great. I planted 10 basil seeds Thursday Oct 18, and 6 sprouted in 4 days. Make sure you use something to insulate the mat from whatever surface you place it on."
5,Heat Mat,"Good Service, Great Product, Did the Job That I was looking for. Would recommend this to anyone brewing or planting."
5,Definitely makes a difference with getting seeds started,"As I have been researching how to improve my seed's germination, I kept finding ""seedling heat mats"" being mentioned. So I started looking at what I would specifically need and bought the Hydrofarm Seedling Heat Mat in the 20 by 20 inch size. It can hold two 10 by 20 inch flats, side by side. You just take it out of the package (it is rolled up), unroll it and roll it back the other way to flatten. place on your shelf (I have a wire shelf), plug in and you are ready to go. You can lay your hand right on the mat without burning yourself. It gives just the right amount of heat to warm up the soil for germination and then keeps the roots warm while your seedlings are growing. I am very pleased with the results."
4,"Hydrofarm 48"" Seedling Heat Mat","So far so good with the mat. Love the length and width. Perfect for my heating stand. I would have given a 5 star but will have to wait to see the length of time I get out of this mat. 1yr, 2yr, 3yr, + who knows at this point. Fingers are crossed.Price of each mat, bought 2, was not cheap so I'm hoping for a nice long life to the mat."
3,A biography with some interesting observations for those already familiar with Davis' career,"Brian Morton's 2005 biography MILES DAVIS is a brief (150 page) overview of the life and work of the great jazz innovator. Morton's book cannot compete with Ian Carr's biography in its breadth of detail, and as Morton's book seems to already assume some knowledge of the Miles canon, it isn't the ideal introduction to the musician. Nonetheless, for fans of Davis the biography is interesting for its critical remarks. While I am not in agreement with all of Morton's points, observations such as that the SORCERER and NEFERTITI albums marked a creative low point are thought provoking. The volume also includes a great many photographs I had never seen before."
4,Award Winning Book,"""Ye Heart of a Man: The Domestic Life of Men in colonial New England"" by Lisa Wilson is the winner of the 2000 Homer D. Babbidge Jr. Award, recognizing outstanding scholarship and is given by the Association for the Study of Connecticut History."
3,Jury did okay,"The jury did all right in the OJ Simpson case because there was no murder weapon, no confession and no eyewitness. How coincidental that Furman found both gloves. The DNA data was impossible to understand.Why was a detective walking around with a vial of blood so long after he should have turned it in as evidence? How sloppy could a blood taker (Paratis) be in determining how many cc's he'd drawn? How strange that blacks and whites seemed to be overseeing two different trials. I paid too much attention to the talking heads at the time of the trial, but now I understand that most of the jury did not trust the police with good reason."
2,Ok....but rather dissapointing,"This book is part biography, part critique, and partly the story of a trial. Dershowitz writes a good book, but it seems to be somewhat flawed. Since he is writing to justify his defense of OJ Simpson; as is obvious when you read it; he is unfair to the prosecution. Admittedly, I did not watch the trial, but he excoriates the prosecuting team; and Marcia Clark in particular; while lionizing the defense. The only time he ever critiques the defense is on Cochran's use of bodyguards from the Nation of Islam; and even then he defends it.Dershowitz also seems to see himself as a person who must single-handedly take on the ""powers that be"". He only uses information that bolsters his position without looking at both sides; as any truly fair book would do.As I said, the book is good, but suffers from several flaws."
1,"Deaf, Dumb and Blind","Alan Dershowitz is deaf, dumb and blind and anyone who doesn't realize this needs help quickly. He has twisted and turned facts so that he can justify his stance with the OJ deal. OJ murdered Nichole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. Anyone who can have their brain muddeled by the ravings of this Dershowitz lunatic, needs a dose of reality. OJ was found not guilty in the criminal trial because of, 1.The shenanigans by Johnny Cochroach, Flea Bailey, Carl Douglas, Barry Sheick (spelled wrong) and most importantly Judge Ito, 2. The ignorant, and uneducated jurors who couldn't find their way out of a brown paper sack. Folks, I hate to break the news to you, but there is no ""Tooth Fairy""...."
4,NeonDragon knows what she's doing,"NeonDragon's beautiful creatures have had my attention for a few years now, and I am proud of how well she did on her ""How to"" book. I've been drawing for several years, but could never manage dragons quite as well as I wished. NeonDragon's book was very helpful; it broke down the complex and ununiform dragon into simple steps with plenty of colorful visuals. NeonDragon even made it simple to personalize my drawings by giving examples of different horns, body and leg shapes, wings, and all other things that make dragons unique. The parts on other mythical creatures wasn't as in depth, but still held my attention and gave me some ideas. It is filled with NeonDragon's humor and spirit and is a wonderful book for one struggling to make thier dragons look good and believable."
4,DRAGONART BOOK,I got this for my nephew 2006. He likes it and has been drawing pictures of Dragons. He is thirteen.
3,creative basics for beginners,"This is a nice book on the basics of drawing cartoon style dragon characters and other mythic creatures. Basic dragon anatomy, color, facial features, poses, and creative ways to draw them once you master the basics are all covered along with a bit of personification, wit and humor. While it is mostly for young adults, more accomplished artists might also gain some inspiration and ideas or at the least get some laughs from Neondragon's colorful creatures."
4,"A Great Addition to my ""Drawing Books"" Collection","Jessica's book is the only other dragon drawing book I would recommend other than my own:Drawing Dragons: Learn How to Create Fantastic Fire-Breathing DragonsAlthough I do find her artwork very cartoony, some of it is undeniably striking and she obviously is a very talented artist. The instructions are easy to follow and she has a fun and homourous tone to the way she writes. I have purchased pretty much every dragon drawing book out there to see how it compares to mine and this is the only purchase I am actually happy with.If you like this book, you should definitely check out her newest one on Fantasy Characters as well."
4,Healthy and tasty,"I've enjoyed this product for several years, and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from Amazon. Thank you."
4,Crunchy,These bars are good. Always nice to have few in the car.Fair value (found better deal on these later).
2,Misleading information,"The package is 12 packages of 6 Pouches. In each pouch, there is two bars. But who cares how many bars in each pouch? The weigh of each pocuch matters, but not how manufacturer package the each pouch. If manufaturer decides to package each pouch with 8 small tiny bars, it does not make the package more valuable. In short, I thought it is 12 x 12 snacks for me, which is good price. It ended up 12 X 6 snacks for me, which is not so good price. I can buy the same product at local stores cheaper and at smaller quarntity. Why shall I order online and buy large quantity if there is no saving? Disappointed."
2,Stale and crumbled,"Had this on automatic order. 3 orders ago most bars crumbly, 2 orders ago most bars crumbly, last order stale and crumbly. Reported this but no response. Unfortunate since when previously ordered most bars intact and fresh. Must be a shipper problem? No longer on automatic reorder. Will purchase elsewhere."
5,We love them...,These granola bars are the best. My three kids love them and that's enough for me! The 2 bars in each package are enough to satisfy them after school or after playing in a game. Not too sweet and they're easy to break apart to eat.
5,I should have looked more carefully!,"Here is the important information on the product page:Safety InformationContains soy, peanut, almond, hazelnut, walnut and pecan ingredients.IngredientsWhole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Canola Oil, Crisp Rice With Soy Protein (Rice Flour, Soy Protein Concentrate, Sugar, Malt, Salt), Honey, Brown Sugar Syrup, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt, Soy Lecithin, Baking Soda, Natural Flavor, Peanut Flour, Almond Flour, Hazelnut Flour, Walnut Flour, Pecan Flour.---Although I am allergic to peanuts and almonds, I ordered the delicious crunch granola bars, oats and honey flavor. When they arrived in their inviting ""100 percent natural, excellent source of whole grain"" I could not wait to crunch down on one of these golden delicacies.I quickly discovered that for me these bars are real wheezers. The taste committee living in my house confiscated them. The report is that they are 100 percent delicious."
1,NOT Bronze and a poorly written manual.,Its advertised as Bronze but its actually grey in color. Not happy there. The worst part is the manual for settings has EXTREMELY small print and you need a magnifying glass to read it and its confusing. The color you see here is NOT what you will get and the description reads to me the bulbs are included but they are not. Wished I had just gone to Lowes and been able to look at one before buying.
4,Jump starting Boats,I Repair Boats for A living . I can carry this pack to the dock and jump start most Dead boat batteries. this pack seems to have plenty of power.
2,Crapped out after 2 years: roughly $6 per jump,"I bought the Booster PAC ES5000 exactly 2 years ago. It worked for the first year and a half. While trying to jump start a pickup in tall grass, a plastic clamp became unhinged, broke apart and, in the process, ejected the clamp spring into the tall grass never to be seen again. You cannot buy a spring from Clore. Have to buy the whole clamp plus shipping so roughly $30 for a spring that self ejected. Then 2 months later the BoostervPAC just stopped starting cars. It had 13v but cranking amps @ 65 degrees were down to 107, not enough to turn a starter motor and well below specs for this product. The warranty is1 year After that you are on your own. So for 2 years of use, maybe 20 starts, and a purchase price of $124.00, each start cost me ca. $6. You be the judge of whether at 2 stars, I gave it one too many"
5,First-rate product,Recommended by my mechanic as one of the best; have used it and works fine. Carry in 4 wheel drive vehicle. Convenient and powerful.
5,phenominal,"so much power in such a small box, its blows away my diehard, same price half the size love it."
4,PAC ES5000 evaluation,"So far, this product performed as expected to start my boat. In the back of our minds, being stuck in the middle of the lake has always troubled my wife and I when fishing. We are not true fishermen/women but love to past the time in retirement doing it and playing some good jazz with a glass of wine? What a way to enjoy life and assure all is well!"
2,WORKED FOR A WHILE BUT NOT REALLY WORTH THE MONEY,"OK, SO WE ORDERED THIS AND IT CAME QUICKLY, WORKED FOR A WHILE, BUT THE PERFORMANCE WENT DOWN HILL AS THE MONTHS WENT BY. THIS WOULD BE OK FOR SOMEONE WHO ONLY HAS TO JUMP THEIR CAR ONCE IN A WHILE. BUT WE USE IT TO JUMP START CARS DAILY. ITS TOO WEAK FOR THAT, AND IT SLOWLY GOT WEAKER AND WEAKER DESPITE CHARGING IT BETWEEN USES. MY RECOMMENDATION, IF YOU ARE A SHOP LIKE WE ARE - BY YOURSELF A LARGE BATTERY - A MARINE BATTERY OR SOMETHING REALLY POWERFUL, BUY JUMPER CABLES AND CUT OFF ONE END, BUY BATTERY CABLES AND CONNECT THEM TO THE JUMPER CABLE. THEN BUY YOURSELF AN OVERNIGHT BATTERY CHARGER. STRAP THE BATTERY TO A DOLLEY, THEN MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOMETHING INSULATED TO CLAMP YOUR JUMPER ENDS TO SAFELY STORE THEM. THIS SOLUTION WORKS SO MUCH BETTER. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH BOOSTER PAC AFTER BOOSTER PAC, WASTING LITERALLY OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH A DIY SOLUTION IF YOU ARE A SHOP LIKE WE ARE."
2,Internal Battery doesn't hold charge,I finally had a chance to use this product to Charge a car battery that was in need of a boost to be started only to learn when I unplugged the Booster Pac from the wall and brought it to the Car that needed to be charged it didn't do anything becuase the internal battery in the Booster Pac was dead . I'm thinking it never really held a charge while being plugged into the 120 volt outlet in my home . I plan on calling today to file a complaint .
4,No compressor!,"This booster pack works very well for what it was designed to do. That said, and it's my fault for being ignorant and not catching this fact, is that it has no compressor onboard. I had become used to my past boosters; they all had air compressors and some a work light, but this is a one purpose machine. If that is not a requirement for you, buy this booster."
1,Don't bother.,"I bought this product, followed all the instructions re: charging etc. I used it once after about 9 months and it was fine - tried to use it again after 2 years and it's completely dead - called the manufacturer and they couldn't be less interested - changing the battery is not financially viable so I guess I just wasted $130.00.I explained this to their tech dept. and there attitude was pretty much ""well you live and learn"" - not a good product and the manufacturer couldn't give a damn - they've got our money and are just hoping that people don't write reviews like this one."
3,"Handy, but they don't make them like they used to.","I bought one of these in 1997. It's really beat up, but it still works. It has a Panasonic battery in it.I bought one of these in 2008. It's cosmetically nice, but it will not hold a charge any more. It has a Clore battery in it.As the title says, they don't make them like they used to"
1,Imperial Defect,"I didn't get far in trying out this game: the drag and drop function simply didn't work, making it impossible to commplete the tutorial. An e-mail I sent to Feral Interactive about this problem got no response. Save your money!"
1,Not for me.,I like to play Civ IV. I wanted something in the same line but a little different so I tried Imperial Glory. Don't like it at all. It's in the box sitting on the shelf.
4,Fun product,I installed this with the led light strips I bought from amazon as well for my boat. Very cool effect at night I love the option of leaving the lights on or blinking to the music.
5,Pimping good times,Product is awesome. Lights beat perfectly under my own control to the music. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
1,Not a good investment,"As a paramedic and Spec Ops medic, this book was a total waste. Anyone who doesn't have a far better understanding of tactical medicine (military or law enforcemennt) shouldn't be even thinking about operating in those venues.The book is written unevenly, has poor quality photos, virtually no suggestions on techniques and very uneven coverage of equipment. There must be a better tactical medical book out there, for a start ""Ditch Medicine"" by Coffee is at least helpful, if somewhat dated."
1,Anecdotal Tactical Medicine,"Mr. McDevitt's treatise on Tactical Medicine is just that - a treatise. Although he covered many areas of tactical EMS, most were just touched upon and certainly not enough information was supplied to educate uneducated or to inform the active practitioner. The book has no scientific references. It appears to be purely anecdotal. Any firm fact to be found there is interspersed with unfounded opinion. To the uninformed, the difference between fact and opinion would be difficult to sort out, to say the least."
2,Very Basic and Bare Bones Book,This truly is just an introduction to Tactical medicine and I would only recommend this book to someone who has zero idea about what entails tactical medicine. This would be a good book for someone who is maybe interested in what a tactical medic does and what equipment they should carry. The book was very short and basic almost to the point of elementary.
5,Learn from the best,"As a paramedic, I found this book to be a valuable resource. The book was written in an easy to understand format, without bogging the reader down with multiple scientific references and incomprehensible rhetoric. While some other reviewers may have forgotten the importance of on the job and in the field training, I haven't. If you want cut and dried science, read the journals. If you want the first-hand account of a seasoned paramedic, read this book!"
5,a masterpiece,"This book was awesome! I picked it up and read it straight through, not being able to put it down. The book was straight-forward and to the point. Other reviews knock this book down for not backing up claims with scientific evidence, but I found the material in this book to be factual. While I was reading this book I had in the back of my mind that some things may be controversial, other reviewers saying the author's opinions arent accepted by the EMS community, but I found none of that. Mr McDevitt had very creative and innovative ideas, especially with improvisation. I have seen him use these tactics in the field, and everything he recomends in the book live up to the true test- if it works in the field. I would recomend this book to anybody in the EMS community."
2,Not durable enough,"First off: this rack eventually broke. It lasted about 11 months. The bottom weld on the drive side failed.Also, it shook out SEVEN of the bolts on the adjustable legs. SEVEN!! If laden, this would cause the rack, and by extension my bike, to lean while riding. I tightened it very hard (almost fearing thread damage), and STILL it spat them out. At the very least these two bolts, being load-bearing and very important, ought to have come with a mfgr torque spec. I *HAVE* a torque wrench! And all the bike's other parts, even non-critical ones, have torque ratings printed right on them! Delta needs to lock it up.I replaced this rack withTopeak Explorer Bike Rack with Springand I haven't looked back."
4,"Alot to like, one concern","Very nice finish, mine has a light mount on the rear, and extra hardware and hex key is a nice touch. Mounted on a rack friendly 90's hardtail Trek MTB with 1.9 rear tire in about ten minutes - simple. Although accurately described, the top platform is just about 12"" long, and a little on a narrow side. It looks undersized on my MTB. In comparison, my Jandd Expedition measures 15"" on the top platform and is wider, a pretty big difference. Not necessarily a negative, it's light and hardly bulky, and it does the job. I guess if you were putting this on a sleeker road bike this size would be actually be a plus. Universal? I think it will fit the majority of bikes that are rack friendly, i.e. have mounting bosses and a fairly conventional chainstay distance. I suspect the largest frames will have fit problems."
2,Not impressed,"Eh h, it fit alright, tuff to get even. Didn't realize it wouldn't work with bikes that are disc brake ready,, even though the bike doesn't have disc brakes it still has the connector for it. Rack was kinda frustrating to get on and the instructions were not very clear at all. A lot of bending of metal to get it to work. Wouldn't get another."
3,Not entirely universal!!,"The ""universal"" mega rack was purchased for my husband to use on a bicycle he purchased from Walmart. It was not very universal to this bike. My husband ended up having to drill additional holes onto the bike as well as onto the rack in order to fit. Eventually the rack was mounted, but I was somewhat disappointed that he had to do so much to fit a rack that is supposedly universal. Maybe it had to do with the bicycle having been purchased from Walmart but I can't imagine that bicycles made for Walmart are manufactured all that differently."
5,Perfect Rack!,"Make sure you measure the dimensions of your bike before buying any rack. What was important to me was to have a height that would make the rack perfectly level, and because the universal was adjustable, it worked perfectly. Again, I used its measurements to determine how exactly it would fit on my bike. Don't just take for granted that ""universal"" will fit your bike. The rack itself is a work of art; the design is great and it comes with enough hardware to mount on a bicycle with and without frame mounts. The very back has a metal flap with holes to allow you to mount a taillight. AWESOME. I couldn't be more happy."
3,R. Olsen,"The instructions for this rack left much to be desired. Also, the hardware was incorrect. I had two extra screws and was short two nuts. I finally got it mounted after going to the hardware store."
5,"solid rack. easy to install, light and durable",use this rack for commuting. fits both my mt and road bike. also comes with nice mounting kit if your frame doesn't have the necessary holes up under the seat.
4,Again with the lousy directions,"So much of what I've bought for my bike lately is ridiculously difficult to put together. (And I can assemble Ikea furniture like nobody's business.) Though this came with directions, it was just beyond me. I ended up paying my local bike shop $10 to do it for me. That said, it's a good, sturdy rack."
4,Religion in traditional societies,"This is a good summary of religion in traditional societies. The authors use examples around the world of various religious practices that occur in traditional societies such as festivals, rites of passages well as religious practioners. They also discuss the use of plants an animals as well as religious topics such as sickness and healing and death and the afterlife. Eventhough the book is small it does asume some knowledge about Anthropology so the text can be fairly cumbersome. In general it is a good resource for those who wish a general overview of traditional religious practices and concepts around the world."
2,Fans of Lethem's fiction should give this a miss.,"This collection of essays is interesting in a pretentious and foppish way; perfect for the boheme grad student haunting the halls of the English dept. These essays are, with some exceptions, stream of conscious meanderings, that become tiresome.For those who really enjoy Lethem's fiction and might be interested in a glimpse at his creative process, I recommend ""Men and Cartoons."""
2,The Disappointed Reader,"Like others have said, these essays just miss the target and at the moment I've given up after reading about half and skipping a section or two. Fairly dry anecdotes with no resonance. It reads as though you are listening to someone speak for hours about their not-all-that-interesting family who you have never met. This can be done quite well obviously but that's not the case here."
4,Amazing writing,"The reason to read this collection of personal essays, is not their subjects, but the thoughfulness of the author and his simply amazing writing skill. Regardless of my interest in the topics, if found them all captivating -- from the consistence of his brilliant writing and the deeply personal cast he lent to each of them. The essay about his father, the painter, is deeply affecting. Lethem's insights into what shaped him as an author and as a person are so candid and meaningful. Now I feel I will be able to read his novels next with a broader perspective into what went into them."
2,Disappointing . . .,"In a nutshell, this book is too erudite and detailed to be worth spending your time on. There are moments of honest confession and insight that are really, really good . . . unfortunately the rest was too detailed to get there. It is only a 130 page book, but it is extremely dense.If you are looking for essays on pop culture, life, or insight into the everyday, pick up Pulphead or any of Chuck Klosterman's non-fiction books. This book was written with a lot of care, but I cannot think of anyone I would recommend it to. (Although the chapter on Phillip K. Dick does make me want to pick up more of his books, so there is that . . .)"
2,Meh...,"Purchased this for my horse-loving girls, ages 3, 5 and 7. It is definitely not as well-made as the Schleich horses and they don't play with it as much as their Schleich horses."
2,"Not what it's ""cracked up"" to be!","I am super surprised. Usually I can get a good idea of a product by the reviews on Amazon. That was not the case here. For one, when I typed in clean comedy this product came up. Not something I can watch with my kids, so to me, not so clean. Another thing is the talking to himself he does. It's a little funny here and there, but drove me a bit batty after a while. I am a christian, but don't hold that against me here. I only audibly giggled when he actually talked about Jesus. For instance, Jesus getting socks as a gift or when Moses may have said ""tada"" after parting the Red Sea. If you want some great laughs, check out Tim Hawkins. His latest ""insanitized"" is awesome and can literaly be watched by anyone. Tim does not use language or innapropriate innuendoes, like Jim here. Doesn't have to."
3,Wonderful Comedian,"Jim Gaffigan has a ""schtick"" that is different from most comedians. His jokes aren't necessarily funny, but the ""person from the audience"" that he portrays, is. It does get old after awhile, but his audience ""character"" does come up with some witty remarks about ""his"" jokes. Great to see a couple of times and then lend to your friends to watch. Nothing really offensive here."
3,Lots of new material doesn't = better,"I thoroughly enjoyed both the DVD and CD for Jim Gaffigan's ""Doin' My Time."" His pieces on both Hot Pockets and manatees are not to be missed. About 50% of ""Beyond the Pale"" is about food, which could be very funny, but he transistions from appetizers to entres to desserts (cake... then muffins... then pie.) He doesn't address nearly as many issues as in ""Doin' My Time,"" as with 50% of the DVD collectively about food, about 25% is old material, which is fine, but that's a large amount to include in a new album. His manatee piece is noticeably absent. Overall, get the ""Doin' My Time"" DVD/CD combo pack. You can catch a rerun of ""Beyone the Pale"" on Comedy Central."
4,"Good , Clean, Funny","Pleasantly surprised with this DVD. It's one even Grandma can enjoy. He sure talks about food a lot. -Hot Pockets- His little audience voice is what makes this sketch really stand out. Good stuff and worth the discounted price you can get it at here on Amazon. He's a bit awkward at times, but that just really adds to his deadpan humor and delivery."
5,Hilarious!,"This was a great DVD, Jim is really funny and will keep you laughing through the whole act! Also great bonus features."
4,Hot Pocket!,"Delightful! Anybody who really appreciates and can understand the driving force behind ""not realizing something tasted like crap until you are done eating the whole thing because you are such a pig"", will love this DVD. Jim Gaffigan is delightful, simply delightful."
5,HYSTERICAL!!,"My husband and I saw Beyond the Pale on Comedy Central and laughed our butts off!! The minute the show ended- my husband got on Amazon and ordered a copy for us and for his brother. Jim Gaffigan is absolutely fantastic! You will be laughing, crying and snorting like a madman! The DVD is even better than the show on Comedy Central because there is no editing! Lots of extras at the end, too. ENJOY!!"
5,The man's a genius,"I highly recommend Beyond the Pale. Jim Gaffigan is one of the funniest comics I've ever seen. I watched this with some friends the first night I got it and I don't think we stopped laughing once. Some of the material from ""Doing My Time"" was repeated on BTP but it's still well worth the money for the new stuff."
5,down to earth funny,"this is one you might have to see. Jim Gaffigan is a surveyist(however you spell it). he takes ordinary topics from food packaging to waiters, and tells how it is. im a simple man. i dont enjoy much comedy nowadays do to the fact that most comedians are nasty and perverted. he is as clean as a fresh towel falling on the floor. most of his material relates to what people are thinking. all in all, a funny white guy for the good in me"
2,He tries,You really have to be in the mood for this one. He's like an old car - it runs ...but no ooompf. Not for the people who need a big belly laugh
2,Slooow....,"Slow moving and dull, and the comic looked like he was going through an uninspired routine. Kept waiting for it to get funny (given the reviews), but it never did."
1,"Lame, unfunny, unoriginal","I didn't really want to write a review. I just wanted to give this one star and vote against it. He starts off with a bit, talking in a hushed squeaky voice, acting like he's speaking for supposed members of the audience. Much of the phrases he speaks aren't funny in the least and make no sense whatsoever. He continues to do stuff like that off and on through the entire show. If this is his gimmick, I do not understand his popularity. It's lame and not funny. Finally he gets into making comments about life, but they are not original, they are not funny; it's just dull observations with no wit. I guess that's a better term than ""lame."" This guy is dull. Yawn. Did not watch the whole thing. Could not endure it."
1,Not Funny,"One of the worst comedian's I've seen.I watched this since it was under ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"" section.I watched Louis CK and Bill Burr.This talentless comedian showed up.I suffered through the entire thing. Not once did I laugh, I didn't even crack a smile.I don't understand how people find him funny.His side voice thing is stupid/annoying/not funny.I don't recommend it."
5,Hot Pockets..,Purchased this for a Christmas gift for my wife. We did not stop laughing for the entire hour. Worth every penny.
4,An amusing hour +,"Entertaining stand up, although not his very best. Perhaps I've heard him frequently enough in the past that it's just not fresh material. He has a style that is quite unique. An amusing diversion!!"
4,Very Funny,"Jim Gaffigan is a great comic. His material is clean, but still hilarious. He is observant of everyday things, and can make a long stint about hot pockets funny. His use of a ""little audience voice"" is also very unique and brings even more humor to his set. It's a great way to spend an hour, and it also makes a great gift for anyone-- it won't offend!"
5,Beyaon The Pale Jim Gaffiagan,I don't laugh at MOST comics. I and my whole family found Jim Gaffigan hysterical.Sent a copy to my best friend too.
3,"Funny, but not super funny","This DVD had some funny stuff and was pretty clean, but it wasn't as funny as the stand-up we saw of him on Comedy Central Presents."
3,ok,"Gave this as a gift, my boyfriend likes it, but we have found that most of this video is on Comedy Central. Overall good movie, lots of laughs and prompt shipping."
5,Jim Gaffigan is Hilarious,"For the first couple of weeks after watching his stand up routine, I couldn't get some of the bits out of my head. Not that I minded. Anything that can make you laugh weeks after seeing, is well worth watching."
5,This guy is GREAT!!!!,You want to laugh and laugh and laugh and laugh? Watch this video! He's on tour and hopefully coming to a town near you. He'll be here in Denver this Friday the 10th. Can't wait!!!
1,not as funny as some of his other shows,"I bought this because I saw a review or mention of Beyond the Pale at the NYTimes website and they seemed to like it.I have also seen some of his other performances on the comedy cable channel that were really funny, so I thought that this new DVD would be full of new and funnier material.But this Gaffigan DVD is not that funny and if you are lucky enough to catch this same performance on cable then save your money and just record it."
1,Not worth it .,"Wasn't impressed. I turned off the DVD after 5 minutes. He was actually annoying to listen to, not funny."
1,"Inner voice, go away","I heard Jim's comedy on a local radio station and thought he was VERY funny. I bought the cd and stopped listening after about 5 minutes. That inner voice or ""audience member"" thing he does is so stinking annoying! If he was to drop that from his act, it would be worth spending money to hear."
1,this book is not correct......,the man that is in prison for these crimes is not the one that commited them. it was the starved rock managers kid that did it. there was so much that was not entered into evidence. this book that steve stout wrote has a lot of missed information. he ended up confessing due to the claims that the individuals made to him that they would hurt his family if he didn't and that is why he confessed. he still claims his innocence today. there are people that testified against him today asking to help him clear his name because they didn't tell the truth.hope you enjoy a book that put a innocent man away.....
4,Setup not a breeze... but a good unit,"We purchased this receiver and it's great when you finally get it set up. I see other reviews saying it had easy setup, but wow now I feel like an idiot because we didn't find it to be so. Of course, we are replacing an old amazingly fine Phase Linear amp that finally gave up the ghost after many years of excellent service. Ah, those were the days of simplicity... it was all about sound quality. But I digress. It took two of us a bit of study to get everything functioning correctly. After successfully connecting components, we proceeded to set stations on the tuner - that could be a lot simpler as well. I consider myself an intelligent person with some computer savvy and I found myself frustrated/impatient with setup. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we are happy with the sound quality. So my opinion is that this unit is great, but be patient and give yourself time for setup. Or call in a friend who has better geek skills."
4,Nice powerful Amp,"This is being used in a dance studio driving two big speakers and a subwoofer. The sound is clean, and undistorted at loud levels. It also provides front panel inputs for an iPod, which most of the dance instructors use. You can select various DSP algorithms, for example, concert hall, jazz club, or theater. I run it ""straight"" since the sound is quite good directly from CD's or the iPod. The price is excellent!!!"
1,A bad book about a sad time,"While the born again crowd will no doubt love this book, those who respect cultural and religious diversity will be appalled."
4,The Author's Perspective,"Being one of the book's authors, I can hardly claim a detached perspective (grin), but I did want to say a few words about Skeleton Key so amazon.com readers could get a clearer picture of the book.Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads is the first in-depth map of the Deadhead subculture, the global community of folks who love the music of the Dead and the experience of Dead shows, and build community with others who feel the same way.I am very grateful that my co-author and I got to record so much of the humor, lore, depth, and passion of our community before the Grateful Dead ceased to exist. In writing this book, we interviewed hundreds of Heads - at shows and online - and we tried to undo a lot of the shallow stereotyping of Deadheads promulgated by lazy journalists by depicting as broad a spectrum of Heads as possible.You're welcome to read excerpts from Skeleton Key by following the link from my home page at http://www.levity.com/digaland/Take care!"
2,Bad steering wheel!,"Never worked correctly right out of the box. The accelerator pedal has intermittent problem and will ""stick"" in full throttle. I had to rip the pedal assembly apart and resolder the connector pins to get it to work right. The R1 and R2 buttons on the wheel will activate at random sometimes which is very annoying. There is no neutral wheel setting, so cars in GT3 always drift - extremely annoying. Overall, a poorly designed and badly assembled set up."
2,Pretty lame,"I found this book a shallow look at issues of big women and relationships. The author made broad generalizations about what big women are like and why some men find us attractive. I found her arguments weak and her conclusions iffy. That said, a woman who walks into a room with confidence is an attractive woman, meaning she will attract those around her in a positive way. And if Ms. Arons somehow instills that confidence in any reader, then this book is worth its money and time."
4,"Pretty good book, offered some new advice","I have been overweight since age 6, and currently wear 16-20 at age 21 (depending on manufacturers sometimes I can get into a 14) Before reading this book, I was completely obsessed with weight and losing it to get a man. I have been up and down the yo-yo the past 2 years, losing 80 pounds, gaining 50 of those back, losing 20 of those, gaining 30, losing 10...you get the idea. I am at a lower weight today because I finally embraced the idea that emotions, not food or weight is the problem.Katie's book showed me what B.S. it is to use weight as an excuse for not having a man. And how having one is not gonna make life perfect. I think this is a wonderful book and wish it had been around when I was younger because it would've spared me a lot of pain. I recommend it and only give it 4 stars because I felt it slighted women who are above size 20, which I was once a 28 and only recently stopped needing 22s and 24s."
4,A Nice Read,"I will be the first to admit that this book was not meant for rocket scientists to ponder over, but the reason for the book can not be dismissed. Plus-sized women have issues with self-esteem and this is reinforced by society's ""size 8 or less is beautiful"" viewpoint. So, if reading a book makes you smile by simply pointing out why big women are beautiful, what is the harm? I enjoyed the book because it demonstrated how wonderful it is to be full-figured. It won't be a classic novel, but it is a POSITIVE affirmation for full-figured women. Thanks Katie."
2,Some misrepresentations,"Unfortunately, the author's belief in Spain, among other countries, as paradise of Romance for the plus-sized is completely unfounded. Spain is even more weight-conscious than the US (if it is indeed possible). And I was a bit miffed to find my country associated with the third world,also.She should have done some research to at least back up her claims."
3,Needs modification to work properly,"I purchased this item for my 2000 audi A6 with bose stereo so i could install a pioneer head unit. when installed as directed, the speakers all emitted a high pitched alternator whine whether i was listening to the stereo or a cd. i knew the HU worked properly, and so did the factory stereo, so i checked the harness for possible fixes. i found no unwanted noises came through the speaker when, instead of hooking the rca adapters (on the harness) up to the preamp outputs (on the HU), i hooked the speaker level outputs (on the stereo) to the rca adapters (on the harness). so to fix the problem, i cut the RCA adapters off the harness, and soldered those wires directly to the speaker level outputs from the HU. now everything works and sounds great. I must admit, i expected more from metra. also - if you upgrade stereos, remember to get an antenna amplifier - audi doesn't use whip antenna's,and chances are your radio won't amplify the signal enough (even in the city)."
3,Very easy to install not a good quality.,"Bought it and installed it on my audi tt 01, the installation was very easy and it took just 20 min, but the quality of the sound obtained was awful, My stereo caught a hight pitch when driving... weird."
1,junk,i got this in the mail today an went to wire my new stereo the wires for the rear speakers were completely missing never had that happen to me with other harnesses its garbage an they need to stop making junk.
1,dissapointed,Extremely dissapointed. I was under the impression that this movie was on dvd. I did not see anything stating that the movie was on vhs. Now I am stuck with a vhs movie and i do not have a vhs player. Sure learned a lesson this time.
1,Wheels by Annie Cobb,"This was a terrible purchase from Woodysbooks...the book came rate ""Good"" but whomever rated it must have had his/her good eye closed. The book rates a ""poor"" at least..the book was intended as a Christmas gift for my grandson, however,in light of the poor condition of the book I cannot in good conscious give such a piece of junk to him. BUYER BE WEAR!!!"
3,"good, but ...","not a great blueberry flavor, and the lemon flavor is FAR superior. Get the lemon. Really. Lemon. Do it right now."
1,WASTED MONEY,"I can't review this cd - it's not playable. I decided not to return it,I won't spend more money than I already did (19.97) - will be cheaper not to buy more cds on Amazon. Kind regards,Ada."
1,crummy little adjment caps,"crummy litle adjustment caps . have rubber cover but no steel cap just a liitle rubber circle that pops over the steel ring surrounding the adjustment screw.easy to loose. the scop is fine ,but the rubber coating allows movement and you loose the zero . buy the less expeive non rubber one and you will be happier."
3,kickerbox1389,"Nice product. No ring mounts..... so need to look for them to mount on my rifle. Only bad thing on this item I can see, when you dial in the distance the rubber boot covering the dial slips, so numbers are not centered. Guess some bonding glue would take care of that. Who knows!"
2,deceiving!,"looks and feels nice, but slips hold and crosshairs rotate constantly due to the mount not tightening enough. i would not recomend this for any rifle greater than a .22 long rifle. our .308 seems to throw it off EVERY shot!"
1,junk,the scope will not sight in would not recommd this product cheap junk. guess you get what you pay for
1,Very poor quality,I bought a 3-9X40 rubber scope/Ruby lens/Ring (SFR3940R) and it is a waste of money. The scope has a rubber cover applied over the scope. It is practically impossible to get the rings hold the scope without the rubber twisting since it is not actually attached to the scope. The cover was actually loose at some of the seams. I am wondering why I didn't just go to Wal-Mart and buy something that I could examine before purchasing. My advice is not to buy NcStar. The quality is extremely poor.
5,"Excellent Price, Excellent Quality,No Issues","I was not expecting anything great from this scope, but when I opened the box and put it on my winchester 94 I was very happy with it. It is crystal clear, the variable zoom works great, the reticle is good, rings are good quality,very solid as a whole piece."
5,"If you like David Kirk, you'll love this!",This book is incredible! A fabulous read-aloud. Buy it! Buy it now! What are you waiting for?
5,Astounding playing,"I cannot recommend this recording highly enough. The first time I heard it (I had tuned to a classical FM station to help me sleep) I sat up in bed and had to wait until it was over to find out what it is. The combination of Hough and Hummel is a brilliant one. Truly an outstanding performance and recording. If you are not familiar with Hummel this will certainly convert you to a collector of all of his music, but especially the fantastic piano music. Preferaby with Mr. Hough."
5,Great CD!!,"I bought this CD a few months ago and I love it.The performance by Stephen Hough is perfect and the recording is very good.I definitely place this album among my favorite piano concertos, especially the Concerto in B minor."
4,Excelent,I have had dry hand for many years and nothing worked until I triedthis cream at the insistance of my boss. Thank you.
3,Way smaller than I imagined.,pay attention to the dimensions. I imagined each toy to be 4-5 inches in diameter. Its much smaller. Good for an infant tho.
5,I LOVE IT!!!!,THIS IS SUPER-DUPER CUTE AND NICE AND SOFT FOR LITTLE ONES TO PLAY WITH. WHAT A GREAT WAY TO INTRODUCE YOUR INFANT/TODDLER TO THE WORLD OF SPORTS! I AM ADDING IT TO MY WISH LIST. (I LIKE TO HAVE COOL TOYS ON-HAND. I HAVE 4 NEPHEWS NOW AND 2 SISTERS AND A BROTHER WHO ARE STILL YOUNG ENOUGH TO HAVE MORE. SO I LIKE TO BE PREPARED!) IT'S ALSO NICE TO HAVE TOYS ON-HAND IN CASE YOUR FRIENDS (OR OTHER RELATIVES) STOP BY WITH THEIR LITTLE ONES. I GIVE THIS SET 5 BIG STARS. IT'S GOOD FOR GIRLS AS WELL AS BOYS.
2,too tiny,For some reason when I bought this I thought it would be bigger. It is tiny. Each ball is really small - too small for a young child to try to catch. They do better with bigger balls that they can throw and catch. Not sure what the point of this is.
1,DO NOT BUY - WASTE OF MONEY,This sports bag is TINY! I have bought pull toys for a Chihuahua bigger than this bag. Would be a great product if it were two or three times larger!
3,Order cancelled,Order was cancelled due to supplier stating that it was no longer available. However I was able to purchase it at my local store.
3,Much smaller than I expected,"These really are meant to be the baby's first sports bag. Like popped the kid right out and can play with these toys. The idea is cute and each ball makes a different noise, but I was very disappointed with its size. I would not buy this again."
4,Wolfcraft router table,"I purchased this router table to work with my Craftsman router. I really like the fact that it mounted up with no adapter plates at all. Smooth, continuous tabletop, metal legs, and metal supports under the table to keep it from sagging due to the weight of the router. Dust collection works well after cutting the little bars out of the port as one reviewer noted already, no idea why they are there. My switch didn't work right out of the box is the big reason it didn't get 5 stars. All in all a good product for the price."
1,No Customer Support,"Paid extra for overnight. While assembling found a defective part. Tried to call Wolfcraft as the manual said. Phone number doesn't work. Sent email,the response was call the store I bought it from. Have you ever tried to call Amazon. To get a small part replaced, I'll have to send the unit back. Don't deal with Wolfcraft, you get ZERO customer service."
4,Gets the job done,"This isn't a tool that gets a whole lot of use, but sure is useful when doing renovations. Good tool. The quick disconnect is a must, especially when handling hot blades. Lots of power. It is also great for cutting PVC pipe."
5,Like new,worked great at cutting metal pipe once I got some blades. Nice case to carry the unit and spare blades
5,awesome saw!!,"this DeWalt saw is awesome, used it for demo in a bathroom, was a breeze, really good product and would recommend to anyone."
3,Worth it for the 1988 Christmas Special,"This DVD features 15 sketches from French & Saunders, and the 1988 and 2002 Christmas specials.The sketches are OK, but do not represent the best of French & Saunders.The 2002 Christmas special will probably not appeal to those who are not familiar with British TV. The opening scene is a parody of BBC One's on-sceen identity and the special continues with lots of references to British TV.The real highlight of this DVD is the 1988 Christmas special. This was French & Saunders at their best and this DVD is worth purchasing for this alone."
2,Awful!,"Again, I love both Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders and am a fan of British comedies, but this was terrible. I am glad it wasn't very much money, but wouldn't buy anything they do together again."
1,Where's the action?,"The book's cover is deceptive. You see a picture of Saya, the ""Immortal Vampire Slayer."" In the nearly 300 pages of text, you see Saya 3 total times. She gets 5 total pages of time in the lime light. The rest of the book is spent following a 15 year old Japanese high school student who is protesting the oppressive conservative Japanese government. There's a lot of filler in here. In fact, the entire book seems like a bunch of random research papers put together (inaccurately) on how to dispose of a body, the evolution of the species, and how protest and anti-establishment organizations work. I kept reading, hoping that something would come of it, but in the end I should have just stopped and saved myself the random philosopical musings of an anime director trying his hand as a writer."
2,Where is Saya?,"Slow-paced. Political rhetoric. Where's the action? Where are the vampires? For that matter, where is Saya? Don't be fooled... it was nothing like the movie."
1,This book is a waste of life,The book is poorly written with almost non-existant characterizations. The writer actually tries to introduce a group of about 8 boys (i lost count-they're all the same anyway) at one go and doesn't use dialogue tags as often as he needs. He throws in a chunk of pseudo-history and there is very little escalation of action. I would have stopped after the first ten pages if I wasn't forced to read this thing for a book club.
3,If you have to cheap out this is the way to go!,"I got this because, I just can't have everything in life, and it is obviously the most affordable out there. I found so many bad reviews but took the chance and am GLAD I DID. You will find complaints about the price of cartridges, but you will also find there are more and more (professional) ink refill stores popping up everywhere. I pay $14.99 for a black ink refill and $16.99 for color. The ink is not ""universal"" junk and the service takes just 10 minutes, is guaranteed and is just as good as the real thing. The printer is compatible with most computers/operating systems (just make sure). The photo quality is not the best but good for the money, you do have to specify what you are printing and what type of paper and use the best quality print job to get good results. I am picky but frugal and I think for the price, you will be satisfied. FOUR STARS FOR THE PRICE!"
4,Nice little printer,"I got this new with a new Dell PC and it served me well. The black ink cartridge holds quite a bit of ink so it doesn't rip you off like some of them. It prints black text very well, which is mostly what I use it for. I found it very reliable. I have no complaints with it."
3,"OK, but not supported by Windows 7","I've had mine for five years. It's fine for an inexpensive printer, though, after replacing the Dell color cartridge with a knock-off, it will basically not print color any more. I use it to print black text, which is OK in ""Quick Print"" mode and much better though much slower in higher-quality modes. IMPORTANT, you can't migrate it to a Windows 7 computer. Win 7 won't take the driver and, I checked, but Dell does not offer an updated driver to support Win 7. So, this printer is on its way to being obsolete."
2,Skip this Product,"While this printer does a fine job printing, replacing the ink cartridge is costly. The only place to get the ink (that I've been able to find)is through the Dell website. Including shipping, one cartridge is over $30. Dell does ship their ink quickly, but it's still much quicker (and cheaper) if you're able to get something at a local store."
3,Not bad for free,"I got this printer free with the purchase of a laptop. I already have a really nice all-in-one photo printer, as well as a Kodak Easy Share Photo Printer dock, so I didn't really need this printer. It does come in handy, though, when I'm downstairs, away from my other printer. I do most of my laptop computer work in the kitchen, so I plugged this in down there so I wouldn't have to run upstairs to retrieve a printed copy. It does a fine job on documents.. black and white. It is horrible with graphics though. It's a fine freebie, but I wouldn't pay for it."
1,"Please God, make it stop",This printer is useful if you're trying to recreate a very specific scene from Office Space. It also makes for a great gag gift.
3,Slow but works good,I bought this printer along with another printer and a keyboard at a garage sale for a total of $5. It works well even on photos but it is slow!
2,720 printer,"disappointed. knew it was used but to use it you have to tape a piece together to have it work. although it does print, it makes a fairly poor copy, is very noisy and moves a lot with printing."
1,worst printer ever,"Doesn't print black, only color- and it's not that old. Have tried three black toner cartridges and none work. This was the backup to my Dell 920- all-in-one printer that has the same problem!!"
3,Outdated printer,I knew the printer is a very old model when I purchased it. I have an identical model which the cartridge feeder broke. I was able to purchase this replacement very reasonably so I did. It lacked a power cord but thankfully I retreived the old one. I wouldn't recommned this printer because of it's age and lack of features. It satisfies my immediate need and was worth the purchase at the very low cost. My PC needs replacing and when I replace it I will upgrade to a new three in one printer.
1,It sucks,"I do not like this printer , doesnt work and I do not like to return my items .. Very Disappointed !"
1,THIS PRINTER ONLY PRINTS PICTURES,Not made at all clear in the description of this product is the fact that it only prints pictures. It will not print text. This limitation should have been posted right from the top. This is a photo printer.
2,Wrong info.......,The item was described as black but arrived tan. The dimensions were only for the base itself not including hardware so it did not fit... I am now trying to make it work with another base as we painted the item black before noticing that it would not fit with the new dimension. Talk about a waste of time and money.....
2,Heavy Duty?,"If you only need to punch a few pages, this will do it. I'm not sure what exactly is ""heavy duty"" about it - it punches no more sheets, nor any better, than your standard walmart 3 hole punch. Your only advantage with this piece is that it will do the 2 hole punch as well. If you are looking for ""heavy duty"" keep looking. And if you print on paper thicker than tissue paper - you're not going to get 20 pages into thse little slots."
4,Just as advertised!,"I use 3-hole and 2-hole punches a lot (far more than the average Joe). When I saw this product, it was like a dream...and for the most part, it works as advertised. The ""locks"" are a pit cumbersome to work at the moment, but I'm sure they'll smooth out over time.For those who look at the picture and say to themselves ""that would be nice"" I strongly recommend the purchase."
3,Too Long,I only like Roberto Devereux. The other two operas are too dark. I love Sills in lighter operas. Maybe if they break this set into three. IT's too long.
1,"Too expensive, and boring, and overpriced","I don't recommend. It's too long. The operas are boring. Sill's voice is way past it's prime. It is terrible. The sound is not bad though. But the Sills voice never sounds so effortful and just thin. Her high notes are pathetic. I think she is a light coloratura, and should stay with singing Fledermous's maid. Sorry, that's my opinion. But although her coloratura is excellent. Her voice is too thin and has too much air and cutting edge. She is only good before she was famous. Her ""Baby Doe"" is superb. But otherwise, her voice is just too shrill.Why do you think she's call Beverly Shrill?"
4,"Happy to buy these little liner cups at a 'reasonable""price","I found these little cups to compliment my mini-muffin pan and I have used them when I have taken mini-muffins on the go to make it easier for me!These same things at Williams-Sonoma were pricy but,I got them here on Amazon for a song! Yippee!"
1,filmsy and overpriced,"This window screen is very poorly constructed, even considering that it supposed to be an inexpensive product. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND of adjustable window screen. I have a couple other, slightly larger, screens from other manufacturers and they are of markedly superior construction and they cost about half as much money. I only wish I could have found this size in another make."
2,InterAct Light Blaster,"I have recently bought an InterAct Light Blaster only to find that it is not compatible with Namco games, which, in my opinion is a severe shortfall."
4,GREAT!,This Gun is a good starter for beginners at Shooter Games. I recommend it to young kids ages 8-12. It is light weight and very comfortable.
5,Great gun,"this i the perfect gun for Area 51. I can't say much but its light wieght easy to get to the buttons and pretty acurate, I suggest a 19 inch tv for this gun"
4,Good deal,"It's a good deal if you dont plan to put a lot inside.It would fit a gun, some cash and passports. I like it for now but I will probably get a bigger one."
3,To small,"I like the safe, it's just to small. I can't fit must of the items that I purchased it for."
5,Good value for the money - does what it is supposed to do,"The safe provides basic security for household valuables and papers. We anchored it to an ""out of sight"" wall in our home. Programming the combination is easy. An important feature is the key over-ride in case of a battery failure. Excellent value for the money."
3,NOT AS BIG AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!!,THIS SAFE LOOKS BIGGER THAN IT IS. SO CHECK THE DIAMENTIONS. IT'S OK FOR SMALL STUFF
5,A BEAUTIFUL PICTORIAL CELEBRATION,"Even if you're not a Pennsylvanian you'll enjoy leafing through this pictorial celebration of the Keystone State. Enriched with 150 color photos by ace photographer Jerry Irwin this landmark volume offers glimpses of every nook and cranny of a beautiful state.There are breathtaking views of Pennsylvania Dutch country in autumn with towering trees lit by brilliant oranges and reds. Who would want to miss the battlefields of Gettysburg, an integral part of our nation's history? Picturesque covered bridges in Lehigh County merit attention as do the majestic Poconos and the Appalachian Mountains.Mr. Irwin's unerring eye captures familiar scenes as well as little known treasures found in historic buildings and landmarks.In addition, photos are accompanied by succinct captions which enhance the viewers experience. ""Our Pennsylvania"" is a volume to treasure and return to again and again.- Gail Cooke"
5,Great!!!!,"This is a great CD. The sound of the clarinet is somewhat different than I would usually prefer, but I seem to like it. Everything sounds great. The only thing is in the Arnold 2 mvt. I here a wrong note in the first two bars of the piece. Maybe it is a different version. Other than that very good!!! Strongly recommended!!! Great work!!"
3,"Not exactly ""gourmet""","I purchased this book in hopes of more exciting flavor combinations, but was disappointed in that regard. The upside, however, is that the majority of the recipes do not use commercial pectin. Still, with the words 'elegant' and 'gourmet' featured prominently in the title, I expected more from this book than the rather predicable combinations. I would consider this a basic jam and jelly book."
2,"Poorly written, for an ""Author""!","I can understand Scott Young's failure as a writer having read the opening pages of this biography.Not only does this seem to be much more a biography of Scott Young, rather than Neil Young, the writing is awkward and the editing is poor.Not worth spending my money on....."
5,Chester,Raccoon puppet was very cute and perfect to use with my first day of school and the Kissing Hand. Arrived very fast.
4,"TITLE SHOULD INCLUDE ""PUPPET""",This critter is adorable but I didn't realize (because I only read the title) that this is a puppet. So tonight I will be sewing up Chester's cavity since my son really just wanted a raccoon. Very cute item though - perfect for The Kissing Hand.
1,Not the best book I picked up on health care for horses.,"I have read several books on health care for horses and find that this book is way below par on all of the health problems that a horse can have. Like take for example, laminitis, this is a killer of horses and yet there is not a full page dedicated to this hoof problem, like how to notice the slightest sign of laminitis. The only other book I recommand from this author is A-Z of Horse Diseases and Health Problems: Signs, Diagnoses, Causes, Treatment. That one is the best as it shows what you need to really look for. He did a really good job on that one. This one just pass up as it's not the best."
5,A well written and informative book,"I found this book to be extremely informitive and well written. It has expanded my knowledge of the equine considerably and would make a great gift for any horse lover. I congradulate the auther on a job very well done, and look forward to seeing his books in the future."
4,"Love the color, proportion is a bit tippy","The color is beautiful and the tumblers are a good size and fit to your hand, light enough for children, but the base is just a bit too small, it makes them much easier to tip over."
3,Leather is too thin,"The purse has lots of convenient pockets and holds an amazing amount of stuff. Unfortunately the leather is so thin that it no longer looks very nice. I have been using it constantly for about a year and while I appreciate the organization it offers, I do wish it was more attractive."
3,"500 crystals.. some look fake, some look ok.","These are some super tiny beads. 20 per color won't let me make a single color bracelet..or anything for that matter. The colors ( each containing 20 beads) I received were 3 shades of light pink. 3 shades of green. 1 black, 1 white. 5 of champagne/beige. 3 shades of blue. 4 shades of purple. 2 of red. 2 of orange. The different shades are not really complimentary to each other.I just wish there were more of the same colors so I could make better use of the crystals."
2,Nice collection but questionable quality,"The order arrived quicker than expected and the detailed packing impressed me. Though the colors were repeated and some were short in count and some looked really fake. Over all, good quantity but not quality. Would think twice if I had to buy it next time."
5,WOW!!!,"My girlfriend is totally into beads. She makes her own homemade jewelry and I bought this assortment for a Christmas gift to help her create her next batch. Since there was no box, I checked out the beads. Oh my gosh, the pictures really do not do these justice! I know she will love them.I ordered these on a Thursday, and they arrived on Saturday. 2 days. The return address says IN, and I'm in NJ for anyone who wonders."
5,A generous treat:)!,"I placed an order for this pack based on the reviews and also because it seemed wonderful to be able get so many crystals in one collection.When the packet arrived,I was in for a treat because the colors offered are beautiful and with a mix-n-match combination,one can create something lavish and beautiful and some more:)!Each color sent is neatly packaged in a baggie of its own,with its own personal label and all the little baggies are packaged neatly in a bigger baggie.To me this has been a value for money package because so far,I haven't been able source these crystals in such a quantity at this price.I might be back to order some more:)!"
5,500 Bicone 4mm Swarovski Crystal beads 25 colors,"These crystals were in excellent condition, great brilliancy and colors. They were separated by color,labeled and I could add them to my jewelry supplies easily for quick reference. I would make my next purchasethrough here again!"
5,Soooo many beads!,"I love that there is such a big variety in colors here. The crystals are of really great quality and sparkle wonderfully! They are small enought for bead-weaving, which is what I bought them for. But, I also bought the 6mm set by the same seller for more of an accent or focal point of bead stitching projects. Either way, I am happy with these beads and would buy more from this seller!"
4,A wonderful job of combining historical fact with fiction.,"Mr. Cooper has done a wonderful job, combining historical facts with fiction, producing a very good book with great promise. The book shows wonderful talent, as it relates a very interesting and accurate prediction of events, if history had turned out differently."
4,RECOMMENDED (with reservation),"This book is a very interesting alternative history ""fast read"", but it could definitely have used better editing. Several typos and run on sentences. Also, not very detailed in comparison to works by Turtledove and others, but this can be good and bad. Doesn't give one all of the explanations (who does?), but this very fact allows one to cruise through the book. Overall, recommended by this reader."
4,"Plausible scenario, accurate historical details.","""The Triumph of the Third Reich"" will appeal to WW II afficionados as well as alternative history fans. Mr. Cooper has done his homework and it shows in the accurate historical details about the participants, tactics, weapons, policies, and economics presented in the story. In fact, it's often hard to know when truth ends and fiction begins. The minor shifts he introduces in the timing of certain key events are quite plausible and could easily have happened, perhaps leading to the alternative scenario he envisions. I found the book to be a very enjoyable read."
1,An...excuse for an alternate history,"Mr. Cooper makes many dozens of historical errors in every chapter. The dialogue is stilted and childish. the flow of the narative is choppy. The premise is so wholy absurd as to be totaly unbleievable. In short I wonder if the author is a Jr. High School student. If I could give negative stars, I would"
2,Good attempt could have been so much better though,"I'll have to start out by agreeing with the other reviewer who noted that the research on this book was lacking. There are parts in this book where it appears the author just randomly grabbed names from history books. As to the proofreading, when using a foreign language in a book learn at least the phrase you're going to use. His German looked like he used literal translation for everything (ex noone would ever say ""kommen und sehen"").The story itself was okay from the pure fiction standpoint (it bombs as an attempt at alternate historical fiction). And in no way approaches the calliber of say Turtledove."
2,bad phone,This phone is a bad product. We have had this phone for 3 months and the light on the phone doesn't work now. You can't even hear the person on the other line. This phone is garbage for 40.00.joan smithchicago
2,Cordless telephones,"We were not pleased with our purchase. It was the phone we were looking for, but the phones appear to have been refurbished. They were not the quality we were expecting."
1,Horrible,Worst phone ever. I kept it for 2 weeks before i threw it away. i didnt return it because i couldnt bare the thought of another person having to use this phone. Stay Away!!!!!!
5,Word,If you like lizzie Mcguire then your should get this little book of Isms! It has words that you can tease people with and use these words when talking to people
3,It dragged awhoooole lot!,This is an okay but it drags a little bit. It isn't suspenseful at all but it is pretty romantic (in Judith's point of view).For some reason it is very tragic.Tybalt seems to not care for her at all.Your best bet is to not read it at all.Because this is probably one of the most unromantic and unsuspenseful VH book you'll read or will ever read!
4,"Informative, enlightening, well-written","Elinor DeWire's book is a page turner, and that's saying something for non-fiction! As an author researching lighthouses for my next novel, I found this work to be a pot of gold. It got the creative juices flowing. Elinor's writing style is very readable and fast paced. She doesn't bog you down with gory, technical details you'd just rather not read about. It is the first work I've read so far in my research, and certainly not the last thanks to the interest this book sparked. I was sucked headfirst into the waters of the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Gulf, the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay, and Guardians of the Lights never failed to illumine my mind with fascinating facts and tenderhearted tales of real people that took their jobs seriously. It's obvious Elinor does the same. You won't be disappointed with this one."
5,Well organized lighthouse keeper facts,While this book may remove the romantic notions we have of lighthouse living it will educate and entertain and make you much more appreciative of the keepers of lights. You may even wish to dig in your pockets to help save and restore some of the remaining lights.The book is very well organized and an easy enjoyable read. It includes useful resources as well. A must buy for lighthouse lovers.
5,Amazing speakers,"I'm probably wasting my time by giving yet another positive reply, but MY GOD these speakers are great. All these people saying they've never heard a better sounding speaker are absolutely correct.I've had my set for about 2 years without a single problem. They sound amazing.Altec Lansing has decided to stop manufacturing the speakers, however. It's really a pitty and I truly hope they bring them back. I'm willing and anxious to buy a second set, despite my first set working perfectly (just as a backup, you know?)."
4,Incredible sound from a small package,"I saw those other sexy little Altec Lansing speakers in the store, but they really sounded poor. I also listened to these and was sold. The sound on this system is unbelievable - comparable with any decent stereo speaker set, great low end base, high end tweeter, and they have mid range cones in them to cover the in between. I still don't get the remote, at least make it wireless, I would rather just not have a remote. Anyway, music and sound from DVDs comes out fantastic, just as good as my stereo. It looses one star because of the subwoofer problem that I know of, and the annoying pop if the speakers are not turned on in the proper order. I still consider these about the best multimedia speakers you can buy."
5,A Great Set Of Speakers!!!,"It's hard to imagine a better set of speakers, The satellites are so crisp and clear they sound more like a high end stereo speaker than a computer speaker, The subwoofer delivers bass that you can not only hear but you can feel, It's hard to describe the sound of these speakers without hearing them for yourself, If your looking for some high quality sound the Altec Lansing 621's are the only way to go!!!"
5,Best Sound System You Can Have For Your PC,I was thinking of either buying a sound system (stereo) or buying this product. I think i made the best choice by buying these speakers. They truely are ground shakers with clear sound. It is really an amazing product and i highly recommend it for those who wants to have a blast sound system in their home. This product is really a good deal. I think it is cheap for the capabilties of these speakers. I love it.
5,Not at all what I expected,"I am a pretty picky person when it comes to my sound equipment. The last theater system was the ""bose acoutimass"" so my expectations are a little high. I read the reviews on these speakers so I decided to try them. First of I didnt think the box would be so huge. The subwoofers enclosure is huge. And the satellites had a good weight to them. But when I hooked it up I was shocked. These things sounded perfect. They have very strong bass. And the satellites are crystal clear. And playing my xbox on it is unreal. This system actually sounds better than my bose. So anyone who is looking get these. for the price it almost seems like a missprint."
3,GREAT SOUND!!! Questionable build quality!,"They sounded absolutely fantastic for the first 2 months.. .but after that.. the internal amp fizzled out. I have the unit on a surge suppressor... and I never over-played the unit or got the volume to high. I am very dissappointed. The good news is, I contacted Altec and they said they are going to put in a RMA to get them replaced. Maybe I'll have them again by March..."
4,Excellent Speakers!,"The sole reason for the four stars is the remote. It is the only ""annoying"" feature, especially since it would only cost Altec Lansing a few more dollars to change the remote to a wireless one. Otherwise, these speakers represent an excellent value. I used the suggestion of one of the spotlight reviewers and connected the speaker system to my DVD player, set at virtual surround sound. In my sister's words, ""It sounds just like a movie theater!"" Good job, Altec. My suggestion: buy them immediately as soon as they come out with a wireless remote, or otherwise they will be sold out."
5,sonic bliss,"first off, let me say that the listed ""features"" of this product are a bit misleading. it says it comes with wall brackets to mount the speakers on the walls, and i took that to mean ALL 4 speakers, but i was mistaken. they only give you 2 little plastic ""brackets"" that allow you to hang 2 speakers FLAT against a wall. so don't expect to mount these on your walls without buying additional hardware. (and you'll need some extra speaker wire too, but you knew that already didn't you?)and that's it! that is my only gripe, these speakers are amazing, and the price is even more amazing. songs i've listened to a million times before now come alive in beautiful, deep, colorful sound. every dimension, every layer comes out clear in your face.an incredible value at (i would say) an affordable price. you can't go wrong with these speakers, you will not be disappointed i guarantee! just remember, lift with the KNEES"
4,A lot of fun and then it died,"This speaker system sounded so good I coudn't believe how at such a low price. Not only that, the name Altec Lansing goes way back, at least 20 years when I was a young one. But one night, after a few, I was ready for great toons and the speakers left me crying. For the price, I am willing to buy two, except they are out of stock. It seems you can no longer count on Altec, it makes me cry, look else where."
5,AWESOME SPEAKERS,These speakers rock; they're awesome. And the design is fantastic and very classy; not cheaply made for the price. They match my HP 754N desktop and MX75 monitor. The sound is really great; I'm very happy. And buy these speakers at Amazon.com....Buy these; I'm sure you'll be delighted as I am.
5,Excellent Value For Money,"This piece is cool. Caution: Not for the weak hearted. The music simply blow ur brains out. I think this is the best buy in its class. I have been using it for some time now, and am highly satisfied by it."
5,Almost the best I have heard...,"I was extremely impressed with these speakers from the first time I heard them on display. Very full sound with good highs (without being ""tinny"" as many computer speakers are). These speakers also have very good low end, while not sacrificing mid voices.The only speakers I have found that out-do these Altec Lansings are the Klipsch ProMedias. I would say that these Altec Lansing speakers are the better value."
3,Just okay,"This started out strong, but then burned out rather quickly. Still, it is a good light read for a holiday evening."
1,"Sweet hell, what happened!?!?","OK, I loved APB's early work all the way up to Welcome To Earth, then Harmonizer came out. It was a big dissapointment, but I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt (even the best bands put crap out sometimes). Well, it seems that's what APB has become now. With their new CD they took everything that made them creative and unique and flushed it straight to China. I can't even call this industrial or EBM, not even synthpop, it's just generic pop now. Avoid this one at all costs, what a piece!"
4,A most interesting life.,"""From Rock to Jock,"" the autobiography of Johnny Holliday, is the remarkable telling a most interesting life in radio.Johnny was at Cleveland's WHK at the inception of the ""rock and roll"" format; at WINS in NYC with Murray the K when the Beatles broke; and in San Francisco at KYA during the Summer of Love.At the right place at the right time. Many a familiar name turns up---movers, shakers, characters and bit players.The second half tells of his Washington journey from WWDC to voice of Maryland basketball and football (over twenty years and counting).It is a truly remarkable story, interestingly written, that will keeping you smiling and bring on a lot of good memories."
4,Delta Seat Post Rack,"I have a carbon frame road bike without eyelets for a regular rack. I was looking for something light that would not harm my carbon seat post. This is the best I could find. Weighs 540g with bolts- a few less grams than the quick-release version. Be careful not to strip the soft-metal bolts which require an english allen wrench? 5mm allen is close but over time will strip socket. I like that this system allows me to keep stuff off my back in the heat of summer, AND it does not drastically alter the balance of the bike like panniers do. It also doubles as a fender on wet roads. Better bolts and this would get 5 stars."
1,Jammed Bolt,"The item arrives with the attaching bracket bolted in place, Upon attempting to install this item I found one of the 4 bolts for attaching the bracket to the seat post was so thoroughly jammed in place I could not remove it. Even though they are Allen wrench cap head type bolts I stripped out the insert point for the Allen wrench as the bolts are also aluminum. The other 3 bolts removed easily. I am returning this item and will probably replace it with something different as I have always had problems with aluminum bolts."
1,"DEFECTIVE, DO NOT BUY!","This rack was originally rated for 25lbs, but at some point customers must have complained about it breaking because the manufacturer stuck a sticker over that rating saying 20lbs. I mounted a total of 13.5lbs. to the rack including a battery, mounting plate and LED light. I went of a curb at walking speed (because there was a crowd) and the weld to the bracket which attaches to the seat post completely failed. I ended up carrying the battery pack on my ride home. Do not buy this product, it cannot even handle 13lbs. Go with a traditional carrying rack."
4,Great quality,"It is a great bike rack. Great quality and works with bike trunks that are not Delta. I just didn't realize how much higher I would have to raise my bike seat. Even though the picture shows the rack angling up, make sure you have enough room."
4,Good buy,Good seat post rack. It mounted fine to my giant yukon. Be advised that the amazon picture shows a 4 bolt mount however the item description was still stating it was a quick release. It is not a quick release. Other than that no problems. Amazon was offering a delta rack/bag combo at a very reasonable price you may want to look for it. june 2007
3,OK for light loads,"I had this seat-post rack for about a year before it gave out on me. It is convenient and pretty easy to attach, but beware of putting too much weight on it. Mine snapped clean through the metal support tube on my way back from the grocery store and that was the end of that. I was carrying one gallon of milk and some other, smaller, items. I do admit that I was probably pushing the weight limits a bit. I have moved on to the ""Delta Mega Rack Universal Rear Bike Rack"" and it seems to be much sturdier so far."
3,Ok bike rack,"I commute everywhere on my bike. Initially, I was wearing a backpack, however my back would always get really sweaty so I purchased this rack to get it off my back. For the price i don't think I can really complain, it works out well enough for me (at least so far).Pros:1. I don't like the look of the full bike racks that attach near the hubs (I know they function better but they just look kinda goofy to me).2. As far as bike racks that attachs soley to the seatpost, it holds a decent amount of weight.3. It isn't terribly difficult to remove/install, just 4 allen head bolts. But with no quick release, I'm less worries about it getting stolen.Cons:1. The rack is too high. The ""platform"" that you strap objects to, is too close to the saddle, and therefore I really can't use the whole surface because it sits just under the saddle and things will not fit.3 stars because I have been limited not by weight, but by surface area to carry things on."
3,not too shabby,"nice product. Fits tight, and you don't need the mounting points just a seat post. Make sure you have everything tied down. Will eject anything on or in (springboard style) if it is not very well contained even on the softest/slowest curb descent/ascent."
5,EYE OPENER,FANTASTIC BOOK. A LOT IN THE BOOK IS STUFF YOU AUTOMATICALLYTAKE FOR GRANTED BUT DO NOT REALLY ABSORB TO MAKE YOUR LIFERICHER. THIS BOOK DOES IT IN SPADES.
5,"Beautiful recording of a great, underated symphony","This is the first review that I have written, but I noticed that there isn't a review for this exceptionally fine recording of Dvorak's underated 3rd symphony. I have 5 recordings of this symphony, and this is definitely my favorite. This recording has depth and richness and a wonderful feeling for this sweet symphony. Last summer I listened to this recording over and over again while I was painting indoors. I have an extensive collection of classical music, and it's rare that I listen so much to a particular recording. So, if you appreciate Dvorak's symphonies, give this one a try."
4,welldone,everything it should of been annoyimg sticker on inside back caver should of been declared that would of been appreciated
2,Not quite what i expected........,"After spending time online looking at different bulletin boards similar to this one that I could hang all of my students name from and create a cute little display, I was sadly disappointed when this came in the mail. The picture makes it look a lot larger than it really is, and when it said it included 20 miniature stockings I assumed that it would fit all of them. It doesn't. It fit maybe half of them along the top of the hearth."
5,Superior product,"Yes, our local Walmart carries algae wafers BUT not this brand. And the last ones we bought would not even sink. Nevertheless, our plecos, clown loaches, cory cats, tetras, barbs and rainbow fish all show a definite preference for these wafers. While they ignored the other brands we've tried, they attack these as soon as they hit the tank. We have to allow a couple extra each feeding to make sure the bottom feeders get any, as the larger fish grab the first ones in and the rest play chase with it!"
4,All my fishes like it! But it makes the water dirty,"I was surprised to see my gold fish first spot this wafer and started to feed on it instantly. My baby pleco was not that interested at first, but figured it out now. However it tends to make the water a little dirty after each feed(I only feed 1-2 wafer per day). That's the only negative I can say."
4,a must have for any freshwater aquarist,"I have a fish room consisting 14 medium size tanks ranging from tiny shrimps to large catfish/pleco types. The hakari algae wafers is by far the most favorite and useful to all live stock. In fact, the guppies, mollies, platies, swordtails, and even neon tetras like them and provides the essential vitamins and algae for proper growth and coloring.Due to the stocking levels in a fish room setup, I buy several of these bags at a time and sometimes I do notice a bag to be of inconsistency (off-color, or hardness)A suggestion for smaller stocked tank is to break the wafers into smaller chunks and spread them. That will minimize any one fish from being territorial of the food.For prolonged use, store in a lock&lock; air tight container in a cool place away from light.Basically, this is a must-feed for healthy livestock in your freshwater tank."
5,My animals love 'em,"The first time I bought these, my dog somehow got the bag and ate them all.I again purchased these algae wafers for the amano shrimp in my aquarium.Puggles and Amano Shrimps both seem to like them :)"
2,More Like Wheat Wafers...,"I do my best to give my fish a diet that's similar to mine, which is full of protein and all natural. My Angels and Blue Rams get brine shrimp and blood worms a couple times a day and live brine shrimp as a special treat once in a while. I feed them flake food and shrimp pellets as a last resort. Because of this I have some seriously gorgeous fish that are happy, healthy, and constantly laying eggs (diet is important for libido). I was a little disappointed to see the first 13 ingredients in these pellets had no sign of ""algae"" whatsoever and included things like ""wheat flour, wheat germ meal, starch, dried bakery product,"" etc. I gave it 2 stars because they do seem to like them... but I figure it's the same sort of enjoyment that comes from eating a twinkie or big mac. Yeah, it tastes good, but it's crap. I'll be searching for a more natural algae wafer for my Pleco's and will relegate these to the bottom shelf with the flake food."
5,tropical alage,love it and so did the alge fish that cleaned my tank thanks it was very useful for them too.
3,The fish like them so what can I say?,"I was happy to purchase this product from Amazon.com! I saved so much money, and my fish like them, so what can I really say about them? I only wish they came in a smaller size b/c the fish never finish them, and breaking them up gets messy."
5,He was my Private Eye...,"Even before I read this book, I hired John Landreth to help me in a very personal matter. After reaping the rewards of his investigation, I read this book and I was captivated by every page. I could never do what Mr. Landreth does, but Thank God he is very good at what he does and he's also very good at writing about it. This is a great collection of entertaining short stories, and I highly recommend reading this book."
5,Great Book!,This book was given to me by John himself as a thank you and several years later I have finally read it. I loved it! Thank you John if you read this.
3,valve lights,the lights are not motion started but you have to manually turn tem on and off which is a nuisance. the yellow ones are not real bright either but the blue stand out better.
1,The Soul Of Your Pet,"I recently lost my Beloved Blue Tick, Chester. I bought this book and several others on loss of a pet. I did not find any comfort or meaning to this book. In fact, it was a waste of money. It is print after print of animal ghost stories. Very disappointed."
2,not ready to hear this,"I ordered this thinking it would deal with animals in heaven. I was not ready to think about the ""ghost"" type stories in this book. I did not even finish reading it. However, it is nice to know that these things are written about."
2,Mixed Emotions,"I really have mixed emotions, not about the book, but about what to write in this review. I appreciate good writing and Mr. Smith does a good job of presenting the material. However, I really did not like the material. I realize a lot of what Mr. Smith said was not his and he was just quoting and/or relaying the thoughts of others, but because he did, I can conclude he believes what those others believe. Quite frankly, I do not agree with any of what he wrote, but I believe he has the right to write it and he does a good job of presenting it. I give him 2 stars for that. I do not mean to be cruel, I really don't, but I feel when you present a subject as ""spiritual"", that is synonomous with ""biblical"" and this book surely isn't."
2,Glimpses and Ghosts and Visions Oh My!,"Unfortunately, this book was not at all what I had expected. While hoping to read comfort about God's will for His animals, 90% of the book was ancedotal concerning visions, messages and contacts from beyond.While for some this may be very soothing and hopeful, I felt misled a bit by the descriptions presented. I probably would not have purchased this book had I been able to skim through it at a bookstore.On the other hand! It was very interesting reading, carefully thought out and presented. I strongly believe that each of us, after the death of our pet, must find peace for ourselves and not everyone holds to the same belief system. So if hearing the evidence of what others have experienced gives you peace, this book hits the nail on the head."
1,Waste of money! Be Warned!,I thought that this would work since it had the trusted name COLEMAN on it. HA! I have had this crappy trap running in my backyard for 2 weeks now and not one mosquito has stuck to the fly paper.Sure the mosquitoes swarm around it. Just before they come over to the deck to bite me!This garbage does not work. Shame on Coleman!
4,Medieval Mayhem,The knight Galerean is travelling through Chartres when he becomes embroiled in the mystery of a man who has been found drowned. The death seems in some way to be entwined with a fire that took place in the town 10 years earlier.To try to get to the bottom of the mystery Galeran stays in the town and mingles with the artisans who are rebuilding the catherdral there.While trying to unravel the mystery he has a dalliance with Dame Ausanne a young physician.The plot is well thought out and keeps you interested throughout the book.Interestingly the author has included some medieval recipes for the reader to try and they look very appetising.
1,Make sure you test this grinder,"I purchased this factory reconditioned grinder and of course plugged it in and ran it when I received it. I loaded it up to take it to my project in another state and of course it was dormant during this time, and by the way the warranty clock was ticking.I got to the job, the first time I went to use the grinder it lasted about 2 minutes. The first indication was it slowed down, but the lights weren't dimmed so it wasn't a voltage problem. Next I noticed substantial arcing from the commutator, and then it stopped. Remember I've only used it for two minutes.So, back through the gauntlet for returning defective tools. Today I received ""my tool"" which was shipped back to me. It was not repaired, it was not replaced, but they paid for the shipping to send it back with a tag that said ""out of warranty"". I guess that it was cheaper to send it to me than to throw it away at the warranty depot.Anyway, I won't buy another Skil tool."
1,Poor design,"Beware of any grinder which exhausts the motor cooling air out the side.This grinder will throw crap in your face all day long due to its poor design and obvious lack of pre-production testing.Ive wrapped duct tape round the grinder body to cover the exhaust ports and now find it acceptable, but anxiously await the day this grinder bites the dust."
3,It's a bootleg!,"I have this very same bootleg, and and it's available elsewhere for $12. It's your money, do with it as you like..."
5,Excellent College Guide,"This is one of the best college guides I have ever read. It's very informative and it's ratings of the academic, social etc. aspects of the colleges give a very nice scope. What I like most about it is that it lists the strongest majors in each college, not just the most popular ones...the first book I have seen with this.I've heard that the essays aren't entirely updated each year, like advertised, but I haven't bought any of the previous versions, and the essays are still very helpful.One of the BEST"
4,Everything cast in a positive light,"Although my high school senior daughter and I are finding this book to have good information, we both noted that every review tells you how great the school is. You can still distinguish the differences between schools based on your own filters, but after you have read two or three reviews, it starts to feel more like marketing material than like ""tell it like it is"" analysis."
1,colleges?,"300 colleges reviewed by tri-delts, ""oh our school is so cool"", some real info would be nice."
5,An authentic Titanic presentation,Unlike the Cameron's love story this is an history buff's film. It seems honest and pure to its time. It's closer to the feel of A Night to Remember than Cameron's last film. The accompanied documentary was a very nice surprise. I found it very informative and well worth the watch but I also had fun hearing each actor playing different parts than I have seen them in the other Titanic programs.
2,Disappointing !,"Titanic Disaster in the Atlantic, had nothing whatsoever to do with the TITANIC. It bore a minute resemblance to the story in the sense that a passenger liner sank in the Atlantic, there the similarity ends. David McCallum looked decidedly uncomfortable introducing this, which I can only describe as drivel. The TITANIC Chronicles however was mildly entertaining in the sense that it contained eye witness accounts of the disaster. In my opinion the saving grace of this DVD."
2,Big Waste of Money!,"I know that since the movie is over 75 years old, it wouldn't be the best. But little to nothing has been retouched and you can tell it is 75 years old. Some scenes such as the sinking scence are so dark, all you see is a black screen. It was a total waste of money. I think it would have been much better if they would have spent the time to clean up the frames of the movie. I'd like to know what they mean by ""digitally mastered"". If you want a good viewable version of the disaster, buy A Night To Remember!!!"
5,One of those 'must read' books!,"A remarkable story! In 1916 a group of extraordinary Yale class leaders, who happened also to be millionaire athletes, organized an aviation unit. These were heroic, very patriotic young men. Wortman makes you feel as if you're in the air flying with them. It's a great read. Don't miss it."
5,Makes a great gift!,I purchased this book as a gift for my husband for Christmas. He is interested in Military History from the French and Indian Wars down to the present. He is also a military collector. He has read it and enjoyed it! For those who are interested in Military History - this book will make a nice addition to your collection.
4,"Great stuff, wrong label","I've been using Super Lube for years, and it's great for clean, permanent lubrication, so I avoid everything else.But although this product is titled ""grease"", it's clearly an oil, and that means it'll migrate much farther and provide a much thinner lubricating film."
3,Tip isn't metal,"I'm sure it will work for what I need it for. I'm also sure the oil is high quality. However, the tip isn't metal, but plastic. Not that it matters in the long run, but keep that in mind if you're ordering this product. The plastic tip has a larger diameter than what a metal one would have."
2,NOT A GOOD PURCHASE,I would not recommend this product to anybody. I've been using a generic brand with the same active ingridient(Tolnaftate 1 %)and it was nore effective than Tinactin. The container was not factory sealed; so I don't know if it's the real medication or not!
3,Playing the human body...,"...Didn't Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd) do something similar in the early 1970s? ""The Body"" soundtrack, from 1970? I feel a segue coming on... :-)"
3,Works great except when not working!,"I purchased this product based on the reviews of this product and others. The unit seemed to work great - at first. However, the battery seems to lose connection with the contacts. This occurred everytime I used the remote. In order to get the remote working again, you have to pull out the little battery tray and re-insert it. I returned the item and purchased a LogiTech Cordless Presenter. It uses AAA batteries which are much easier to come by. The LogiTech remote works great. I've used it several times without any difficulty."
2,Battery connection,"The connection to battery is lost so very often without any apparent reason, bringing the presentation to a complete halt. I fiddle with the battery compartment, occasionally succeeding in bringing the remote back to life. More often, however, I have to go back to the keyborad. When the connection is okay, the remote works fine. These episodes are not many, though!"
4,"Awesome, owned for several years and still works !","Awesome, owned for several years and still works !Only thing keeping from a 5 is that the laser pointer seems to only work while the battery is ""fully"" changed.able to control laptop from 30 feet."
2,"OK for Slides, Bad for Mouse","The mouse movement button is set below the level of the slide-show buttons, making it inconvenient to operate. Mouse movement is both slow and inprecise, regardless of how I adjust the computer's mouse settings. The device does not fit well in the hand, and becomes uncomfortable with long-term use. I have an older Interlink Remote Point that I really like and was hoping to get something similar. This device it not it. (My employer bought it through another vendor, not Amazon.)"
1,Not a good book...Hard to read,"I didnt like this book at all.First the authors just waste too much space using too many words and phrases to describe something.Second, the authors dwell too much in describing everything in a political context which is not a bad idea but in their case they just stumble too much without really given a concise and direct approach to whatever they are describing.Sometimes it took me several times to read a paragraph to try to understand what the authors were trying to say.I just cant recommend this book for a subject so difficult."
2,Yahama is better,"I broke the volume control on my inexpensive 5 watt speakers and was looking to replace them. I purchased the ASC22's with a rebate so it was an excellent price but they are not nearly as good as the Yahama's were. No tone control so these sound very bassy (but not a good bass) and I can't increase the treble. The yamahas at least had a tone control. I'm going to look for the yahama YSTM40's which have 24 watts power, seperate bass and treble controls, comes in black, and doesn't have a subwoofer which I don't need. The Altecs go back. (...)"
2,You can do better,"At first I was okay with these speakers. They were ... and weak of course, but I wasn't expecting much for the price. Then I started having constant crackling and popping noises whenever there was any bass whatsoever(at any volume). I guess if you don't care about sound AT ALL, these will work fine. They won't even replace a basic CD-player for music purposes though. If you want to play games or listen to music ever, but don't have much to spend, splurge just a tad and for $... you can pick up the Labtec Pulse-424 3 piece setup. Those are an amazing steal. Normally I think Altec-Lansing makes good stuff. Who knows maybe I got a bad set? But they were unbearable."
5,Great Speakers...,This is a very good 2-speaker system.Surprises sometimes come in small packages and this is a good example.Recommended...
5,Great Eps!,I really liked this collection of classic eps. The cloud of uncaring was my favorite one but I really enjoyed the others. Anxious for the new ones to come out.
2,Somewhat Confusing Symphony,No problem with the performace or the recording. It's just that the symphony does not seem to work. It never seems to find its rhythm like the Bax No. 3 and No. 4. The movements all seem like separate pieces. I could not figure out what the composer was doing. I would avoid this one unless you really like Bax.
2,Triton GPS software,Works with the triton gps.... maps are ok. They are also not up to date like msn or google maps are. Also it doesn't look as anything like what they want to you to believe. It seems like that only option for triton users....
1,Bad product to use in Garmin GPS,"I bought this product from AMAZON to use during a trip to Hanover, as it was my first trip to it and I have a Garmin Colorado400i with 3d.I looked a map that could show me routes and montains in 3D, instaled in my computer and tried for three days to load my GPS.Just today after more than 24 hours I received an email from Topo saying that this map can not be used in GPS (ONLY in COMPUTER).So my money does not has value for this company because it is not clear that this is only for computer.BAD PRODUCT, especial if you want to have it in your Garmin."
1,Semi-precious stones,"Have not read, but not what I wanted or needed-very disappointed, as this was added to other books of totally unrealated subject"
5,"Good for law students, and addition to any bookshelf","As you may read from the many reviews, this book is a solid, well researched and filled with rich information.It's out of edition now, but still new enough that you'll still get a lo of this book. It's very cheap used now, so it's a great addition to a bookshelf.Buy with confidence!"
5,Perfect,I was very impressed with the service I received. The book was in better condition that I was expecting and it arrived promptly after I ordered it.
4,Belongs on Every Real Estate Agents Desk!,"This book has an abundance of information and should be on every Real Estate Agents desk. Not only is it good for reference, but makes a good read for the NEW or Experienced agent. It's a definate resource of useable information.My only concern is that the book says it is updated every year. The current 33rd edition is copyrighted in 2003. There is a web site you can go to which has a download page of ""updates"", but looking over the updates, I am not certain that they cover every year from 2003 thru 2009.This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars."
4,Little Girls favorite,"I got this set for my daughter for Christmas. She's 2 years old and watches the PBS airing of the same series. I'm not thrilled with Martin Short's Cat, but she's a big fan. The picture quality and product are very good to excellent."
1,BLECH: SUCRALOSE! gross,"I was stoked to pop up a bag for an office snack...and first bite: ""Ieww, what's that chemically enhanced, saccharine taste on my tongue??"" Ingredient label confirms: SUCRALOSE.If you want an authentic tasting kettle corn, TRY ANOTHER BRAND cause this just didn't cut it.""OLD FASHIONED KETTLE CORN""--no way. They didn't have artificial sweetener back in the old-fashioned days.Super disappointed.Made a suggestion to Diamond Snacks that they should label the front of the box more clearly."
5,"Great system, although different model than claimed on the box","System looks and sounds great. Features I really like:(i) Appreciate that bass & treble are adjustable,(ii) Individual CDs can be loaded into the system while one is playing,(iii) for mp3 CDs, the song title and artist name is displayed,(iV) FM Radio reception is good - in fact, much better than much more expensive systems I tried & returned (Cambridge Soundworks, Bose),(V) Looks nice on the shelf - not overly aggressive looking,(vi) Remote control layout is well thought and remote range is good, and(vii) great value - for the price, this is unbeatable.Quibble: I ordered an SC-PM31 from Amazon, the box says SC-PM31 on the outside, but the system inside is labeled SA-PM31. Not sure what, if any, difference there is between the ""SC"" and ""SA"" - I haven't found any as yet. However, I usually expect the box to contain what it claims is inside."
5,A grand system!,"I love this Panasonic microsystem! 160-watts, that's a lot of power! The sound quality is fanatasic, especially on MP3 files with Panasonic's Digital Re-Master. The 5-CD changer is pop out, so it looks cool when you open it. It's looks and feels durable. There is an EQ, which is awesome, and makes sound even better! You can play MP3 files. Best of all, it shows MP3 ID3 tags!!! Awesome! The price is right. Go for this system!"
2,Tinny and Cheap Sounding,"Sorry, People, but you get what you pay for. The speakers come connected to the wires so you don't have much leeway in terms of placement...you can only stretch them ""so far"" from the receiver. Tinny sound, especially when you click to Surround Sound (adds too much treble). Cheap looking, way too deep (wouldn't fit on my stereo shelf). Too bad I didn't get a chance to listen in a store before buying."
3,poor sound,"Very cute system, but the sound quality is not all that great. I tested it against my other mini system, and the sound doesn't even come close to my old one. It doesn't have the ability to hook up other(better) speakers, which is a big deterrant."
5,The preeminent and peerless introduction to poetry,"A classic for Classics. Perrine's books have been, for over 25 years, every student's skeleton key to poetry and every instructor's godsend. As I re-enter college and the teaching field Mr.Perrine's works make reacquaintance with the Greats like meeting your best friend's family for the first time. SOUND AND SENSE leaves no stone unturned. Metrics, rhyme, imagery, metaphor or simile, they're all here. The examples are relevant and comprehensive. The explications are clear and concise with a minimum of academic folderol. You will be hard pressed to find an instructor critical of this anthology."
5,"""Sound and Sense"" for good cents",This is a terrific book for anyone writing poetry. Amazon made it available at a incredibly low price and it was delivered quickly and in good condition.
4,Sound and Sense,"I read this book in 1961-2 and enjoyed it ( earlier edition). This one seems more modern, but enjoyable. There was a lot more scribbled notes in the margin than I expcted ( 2nd hand book)."
3,Haikus for Enjoyment,"Sound and Sense give way / You broaden my horizons / Now please go away /An excellent text / Written with much great gusto / No longer perplexed /Chapter by chapter / Defintions presented / 'mid students laughter /Annoying questions / Given each and ev'ry day / I must thank DH /These reviews appear / sarcastic to the masses / As well they should, dear /P.S.Apologies take / For the erroneous lines / Amazon wraps words /"
1,Brown Students are Correct in All Things,"Since a Brown student believes Sound and Sense to be an inferior book, I will follow suit. Considering how Yale merely pretends to be the superior school, when deep down we envy Brunonians. They deserve the Ivy League Championship in football this year. Even though Brown is filled with post-modernist liberals, it is still the majestic jewel of the Ivy League. God save the Queen, and God save Brown!"
3,Sits outside the window...returned,"I don't have a negative opinion of the product beyond the fact that it's not what I wanted.I hadn't realized that the adhesive for the visor sits outside the window. It's just stuck on with tape above the window itself, so if the adhesive fails in any way, water would just leak inside of it and the visor wouldn't do much good.I have no idea how likely such an adhesive failure would be. Regardless, I didn't like how it would've looked affixed to the outside of the car.I thought that this was the type of product that fit into the top of the window itself, so any adhesives would be inside the car and effectively covered by the top of the door. I would think those products would work much better, as well as looking better.I didn't attach them and returned as-is. If you're looking for a product that sits outside the window and affixes to the outside of your car, this may be fine for you."
4,Great Book,"This book is very thorough and I have to say...I cannot read more than 4 or 5 pages without taking a break because it's so much information!Nevertheless, this is one of the best resources about vikings I've ever come across."
1,HUH?,"Ok... I didn't read the entire book. I couldn't. If you are a viking scholar with a good idea of Scandinavian geology,, you MIGHT be able to follow this book. I could not follow it at all. ""Dorchenstuffer from Smidindunker in the providence of Climinhuesen was at war with Durkinshmesir Orgulhussien of the Rodgerstifinlugar""........ That's not an actual quote.. but it might as well be. I think you get the picture. This book is way over my head. After about 90 pages of this I had to quit... I absorbed NO information about Vikings at all."
5,Great Value for the Quantity offered!,Needed to get small money envelops for a project and was unable to find the quantiy needed anywhere else. Just what I needed!
3,Nice,"Great RO unit for the price.BUT...I almost thought I would have to return it because I could not for the life of me find a way to attach it to a sink without a MASSIVE amount of leakage... Finally I found that it fit on the garden hose faucet.I really wish I could attach this to one of my sinks inside, its gets really annoying to attach and un-attach the unit every time I need to make RO water.Maybe one day I'll be able to find a piece to attach this unit to my sink without a problem. For now I'll just have to deal with trudging this thing once a week indoors and out. Good thing I don't live in a snowy place lol.***If anyone reading this review HAS found such a piece please send an email my way :) ***"
1,Does not fit,Contacted seller asking about a kit as it didn't fit my faucet. Response useless.Went to Lowes and took manuel and fittings taled to two sales people without success.Went to Home Depot with manuel and fittings taled to four sales people without success.Went to largest local plumbing supply.... No fitting..Unable to use this product....
3,"Bahian pop, with a slight artsy edge","The solo debut of Bahian guitarist/singer Vincente Barreto, longtime collaborator of tropicalia weirdo-elder Tom Ze. This is a pretty poppy album, influenced by the ""axe"" sound of the 1980s and '90s, as well as the Brazilian pop style of Gilberto Gil. Barreto's later albums had a more acoustic feel; this one is more synthy. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
2,Simply Just Terrible!,"It was such a good deal, that i don't mind taking a risk of purchasing this 14 k white gold 3 stone princess cut diamond pendant (1/2cttw, I-J color, I1-I2 clarity) for my mom; However, i regretted after seeing how crappy the diamonds are, i am so embarrasses to even think about giving it to my mom. The diamond doesn't sparkle at all, I have purchased a 1/2cttw diamond necklace (about the same specification) for about the same price as this one, and it was so much better than this! Please don't give this product to someone you love, because that's just rude and cruel. This item is definitely going back to Amazon, in fact, i can't wait to ship it back tomorrow! Seriously, i wouldn't pay more than a $100 for this necklace!"
4,Curtain tie backs,I bought them so I can open the sheers to have a quick view of the tree with wildlife. Even my Son said they are great cause the sheers can be opened when the windows are open. So quick and easy.
4,Sci-Fi with a classic look-and-feel,"Those who enjoy 1950s sci-fi classic movies will enjoy this -- there are many nods to the original ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space,"" and other movies from that era. The cast is very good, especially Burgi as the monster-in-human-clothing, and the effects are nicely done. If you're looking for another ""Alien,"" skip this movie. But if you enjoyed ""Them,"" or ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" it's right up your alley."
4,Lots of clear examples,"The book's greatest aspect is its thorough grammar explanations and follow-up examples. All grammar points provided are backed up by understandable sentences that you could imagine using in daily conversation. Furthermore, its beginning chapter dialogues are interesting and all different."
1,Not good for people who want to learn Japanese on their own,"This is a great book to learn Japanese... But only if you're a part of Hasegawa's class. I bought this book hoping to learn Japanese on my own. And while it offers some good insights, I can tell that there are many holes in this textbook. These holes are where the professor teaches you a particular skill and then utilizes the problems in the book to practice those skills."
5,"""Simply Wonderful, Darling""!","I loved it, but also would like to know how to obtain the audio commentary. Please someone let me/us know! Thanks and happy viewing!"
5,Essential,"A must have for any fans of great performers. Judy is better than we remember. Over the years everyone has dismissed the series as a disaster. This collection proves the opposite.Yes, there are moments when things go wrong and there are moments when the support players are simply awful. Through all of this Miss Garland triumphs and is completely mesmerizing.A wonderful way to relive the season of 1963-64 when these shows were originally broadcast. They truly don't make them like this anymore and we are all the sadder that they don't.The set is exemplary, especially if you read the book while watching hte programs. This is particularly illuminating.The set advertises a commmentary by George Schlatter (originaly producer). I could not find it anywhere. Ok Pioneer, own up is this a boo boo in an otherwise perfect set?"
5,We have Lift Off,Just wait until you see Judy sing The Battle Hymn of the Republic for the first time in the show. Her talent is supernatural. What else can I say. I have so far only bought the first box set and will soon buy the next. I wish that the shows could be packaged in complete running order. I would be prepared to buy the ones that I have already purchased again. Pure Heaven.
5,That's Entertainment!,"Okay...so first I bought this set and THEN I bought a DVD player. What does that tell you. This set, in one word: WOW! You could put all today's divas with their pyrotechnics and monster bands and, were she alive, Ms Garland would still blow them all away."
4,Interesting for Advanced Mexican Cooks,"If you're already aware that Mexican food is as close to divine as food gets, you'll enjoy this book, but most likely be a little frustrated by the lack of specific ingredients available stateside. Ms Kennedy rambles a bit, but it's all enjoyable. If you're a novice, I'd suggest her Cuisines of Mexico."
3,"The recipes themselves are great, but......","I've always enjoyed DK's books enormously, but this one was a disappointment. It reads like a very boring travelog, so I was glad to find it in my local library instead of paying [item price]!I yawned through the first part.... and finally managed to read the entire text, but it was all so dull...and pointless. I hope she sticks to brief background notes and more great recipes in her new book due out soon. The recipes, as always, though, are really good!"
2,LOUD,"Pump is extremely strong as advertised but if you value ""quiet"", do yourself a favor and run 2 smaller pumps like the Rio 17HF's. Rio pumps are a good bang for the buck in most cases."
4,My Son Loves This Swing Set,"We purchased this swing set for our 2 year old son who just loves to go to the park and play on the slide. As soon as we brought it home my husband just had to put it together - very simple (if you follow the instructions). Just a few simple steps and your child is on their way to play. I do recommend cementing the poles into the ground as stated in the instructions. Price was reasonable on sale [...]. My only regret is not shelling out some more money to get a bigger set. All in all it was a pure joy to see my sons eyes light up when he saw his very own ""park"" right in his own backyard."
2,Missing parts...,"My husband and I were very excited to get this set up for our two small children. Unfortunately, the set was missing about a dozen pieces. We had to box it up and take it back to the store after already assembling most of it. What a waste of time."
3,Outdated,This is an interesting view of this madman although the material is getting dated. There are not a lot of other detailed works of his life so this may be your best bet. The book moves ok with some interesting facts but I doubt it will keep you up at night.
4,Tom Jones: A long read!,Whilst this is a long read - a very long read! - it is well worthwhile persevering. Fielding has a delightful sense of humour which can range from the subtle to the rumbustious. The plot develops slowly and Fielding himself tells you to skip some chapters if you just want to follow the story and not go down one of his side excursions.Only given four stars because of its length. The perfect book for long cold wet winter days sitting by a fire with a glass of port to keep you company.
5,A classic read,"if you've never read it, please do! Take your time and enjoy a fun story, classic literature and timeless humour!"
1,couldn't get through it,I'm ashamed to say I simply couldn't maintain my interest in the story because of the constant digression of the author.
1,Don't believe the hype,"A lot of reviews on here rate this DVD highly because the kids like it. Some kids would like ice cream and gummy bears for every meal but that doesn't mean parents should provide them. This DVD is really, really disturbing. The plot is strange and dark and made me (as an adult) uncomfortable. Many videos have some sort of fantasy/mysticism but this one was closer to the dark side of things. (Side note--it's not even rated.) The female characters are dressed inappropriately (very short skirts, midriffs) and some of the dialogue and visuals are sexually suggestive. Yes, your kids will probably like it. Don't buy it."
2,Not what I expected,This was the first Bratz movie I have seen. My daughter wanted to watch it. I thought the graphics were poorly done and the story was strange. My daughter does like it which is why I gave this two stars.
3,If you love the Bratz you will love this one too!,"My daughter loves all the Bratz movies and this one was no exception. It was fun, great graphics and color. As usually new characters were introduced some fun and some mysterious. They make the boys Dillion and Cameron do funny things, which is typical of boys in love or struck by beauty and mystery. As usual it comes down to friendship, understanding of one another and helping when you can!"
4,great,I gave this movie to my 4yr old niece and she loved it. she was so spyched she did not wanted to let it go. We watched it right away. she broughted to the sleep-over and the girls love it. my niece has a bratz fever.
4,My daughter loves this DVD,My seven year old daughter has all the bratz dvd so she was excited to get this one..
2,Mediocre light output,"We have one of these lanterns and find that it doesn't put out enough light to be very useful, especially on the low setting. Even at the high setting it puts out just enough light so you can see to not trip over things in the dark.We like the fact that it's rechargeable by either 12V or 110V so that we don't have to keep supplying it with batteries."
2,Cheaply made,"I've owned two of these things and, in my experience, these didn't live up to Coleman's usual high quality. If you drop this thing on the ground from picnic-table height, kiss it good-bye. The plastic holding the batteries in on the bottom of the lantern is hard and is easily cracked.Additionally the fluorescent light just isn't aesthetically pleasing if you're camping. If you're using it out back by the pool, maybe, but not by the fire in Yellow Stone.Go with the gas lanterns, better quality and better light."
4,Good for most applications,"I use this all the time, indoors and out. The only thing this wouldn't work for is lighting up a campsite. You'd be able to see at a campsite, but not too well. If you are on top of the lantern you can read by it, but it is mostly for general use."
3,Corriher lite,"I really enjoy Shirley Corriher's cookbooks as she does an outstanding job with getting at the root problem of why food fails. And she is one of the few cookbook authors (not recipe book compilers - and there is a difference) who makes an engaging guest on cooking talk shows.So I was really disappointed with this DVD because it contained so little.The basics are there - how different foods react with different cooking times and other ingredients. But the examples are so few and so limited!I would recommend this DVD for people who want to introduce themselves (or a friend) to Corriher's terrific personality and cooking tips. If you are a fan of Corrihers however, this DVD may disappoint."
3,"Hooray, we got one","The game boy was a specific request from a grandchild who is not demanding as many youth are today, and at a time when everyone wanted it. We found it listed on Amazon, ordered it, and it came in less time than advertised, was charged and fired up and did everything desired. We old folks don't play with this kind of gadget, but we surely enjoyed watching the concentration and determined action of the younger set!"
5,This is Awsome!,"This is the best! I have One. Don't get the nintendo ds. Get this they sell way better games on it anyway. The ds just looks good.My friend has one and regreats getting it. He says""It was a waste of money."" This is also less money. These are rare too!"
3,Whoah!,"Simply put the sp is SWEET!but,The nintendo ds is apon us nov 21, a brand new sestem. IT has two screens, touch screen,microphone, close range wifi(throug away your multi tap!)And long range wifi.If you dont belive me,check out nintendo.comnevertheless, ive had the sp for many a year,and it is a verry reliable sestem.I do reccomend waiting though."
2,the best gba ever,once i heard that they were bringing out a new gba i asked my mom how much it was and it was very expensive and asked for it for my birthday and i got it i love the GBA sp.great for young kids.
2,VERBless,Gameboys are just another way to stop kids from getting outside and playing real sports. Instead of playing a soccer vidio game you should go outside and play soccer and that way it is a heck of a lot funner! TTFN.
1,Buggy and dull.,"Game tended to crash every few minutes. The graphics where nice, but the game play in very linear, and your movement is restricted by stuff that a real tank would roll over (picket fences are not tank barriers).If you want to play a tank FPS, try Panzer Elite."
1,Don't Bother,"I agree completely with the first reviewer. If we would have had Sherman tanks like those in the game back in WWII, we would have been in Berlin three weeks after Normandy! The two worst things about this game are that I won't get my money back & I won't get back the hour of wasted time it took me to finish the game.That's right... it only took me roughly one hour from loading the software to completing the last stage. Stay away from this one!"
1,WWII TANK COMMANDER - RIDICULOUS,I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME FIGURE OUT WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO GIVE OVER $400.00 FOR A VIDEO GAME. IF YOU REALLY HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY TO WASTE TRY FEEDING A HUNGRY CHILD OR TAKING IN A STRAY ANIMAL.
3,COME ON!!!! Have to buy maintence parts ALREADY!,"Printer is priced well. HOWEVER, if you're going to ship me a refurbished printer, it should at the very least have a new transfer roller and other replaced consumables."
5,The Prisoner is an excellent series,"The Prisoner is an excellent series. While only 17 episodes of the show were made, debate on the show still continues today, nearly 30 yrs after the final episode aired. It is a deep and meaningful analysis of the Individual struggling to survive against the Collective, set in a surreal and mindboggling setting. I highly recommend for any fan of interesting and intriguing suspense, drama, and action!"
2,good reasons they're outtakes,"It's easy to see and hear and think about why this version is inferior to the original broadcast. Man, does this need editing! Rent it maybe, to satisfy your idle curiosity, but it's definitely not a keeper. Unless you have your own studio and want to make your own edition of this tape, with boundless energy, free time and imagination, and plenty of friends to inflict it on, forget it."
3,"not the best, but worth watching for Jason Brooks!","I am a fan of Jason, what can I say? Have you seen him in 'Days'? He's awesome, and while in this movie he doesn't get to exercise his acting skills too much, I think you will still find it entertaining. The actor who played his brother was a joy to watch...he almost stole the show...I was quite impressed! The plot is imperfect but what plot isn't. Screenplay writers have so many people to answer to. The special effects were completely low-tech but fun. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I wasn't expecting much seeing that this is Sci-fi. I give it 3 stars because with a little more work, it could have been great."
1,worst movie i've ever seen,without a doubt one of the dumbest pieces of junk i've ever seen. but almost entertaining because of how bad everything in the movie is. not a bad compilation pseudoscience and theres a delightfully insensitive portrayal of a dna scientist's mentally disabled kid brother in there. terrible terrible terrible. the guy who gave this a good review mustve had some relationship with the son-of-a-producer who had the means and gumption to put together this junk. reminded me of some equally silly 50s B- movies that also had labcoat dudes calling chimps 'monkeys'...
4,An Above Average Movie,"""The Darwin Conspiracy,"" is a good film which deserves recongnition. I was expecting a ""B"" grade movie, but was surprised with its fairly good acting, nice plot twists, and decent musical score. It was good, clean entertainment with a facinating storyline concept (which could have been developed a little more however). Despite some slight flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and was left wanting more at its conclusion."
2,redneck,I happen to know Dick Cote and just wanted to see what kind of books he is writing. Just is not my kind of read
1,Never Judge A Book By Its Cover!,"Nice big bright box that gave the impression I was getting a thorough guide for my DBA exams. $150.00 CDN later, I find this package to be a total waste of money! 1 poorly written book full of spelling errors with 2 cheap CD's is all this package contains. 1 CD does not even install properly! PASS ON THIS ONE!"
1,"DOES NOT COVER TEST 5, ORACLE8 NETWORK ADMINISTRATION.","Very flimsy, lightweight treatment that is NOT geared toward passing the Oracle DBA Certification exams. DOES NOT COVER TEST 5, ORACLE8 NETWORK ADMINISTRATION. CD course is a toy. If you are looking for a good study guide to pass the DBA certification exams, keep looking."
1,Stay Away From This Book At All Costs!,"The book and the CD's with it are a waste of money! I received two of these books (one I ordered and an extra one sent to me). I sent the other one back but so far I haven't received a pre-paid mailing label to send the other back. I guess they don't even want it! I'd give it zero stars, if the rating would allow me."
1,THE ONLY GOOD THING WAS THE PACKAGE(BOX),TOTAL AND COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY NOT EVEN WORTH A DOLLAR.(AS FAR AS IT'S USE AS AN OCP CERTFICATION STUDY MATERIAL IS CONCERNED).
4,The Complete Oracle8 DBA Certification Training Course,I do not agree with other reviews. This book has been the backbone of my success to OCP. I have learned a great deal and without it i would not have pass the exams. For the basic hard working begginer. strongly recommended.
1,May be a good introduction to Oracle but no help for OCP,This is a very 'Incomplete' training course. May be good for a rudimentary introduction to Oracle but is of no help for certification.
3,Hands on was good!,I actually enjoyed the hands on and visual cues given on the CD. The information was good but the format of the program was very confusing. Better books/course need to be written.
4,No One can Characterize like Patricia Wentworth!,"We already know that Patricia Wentworth has the ""murder in the country manor"" genre down pat, and this book does not disappoint in that fact either. But I feel that Ms. Wentworth can draw characters very well indeed as well. Her characters are so real that as I read, they bring to mind actual people that I know that ""were just like that"". Her character of Mrs. Latter in this book is a fine example of this talent. She is exceptionally well-drawn, and appears so realistic. This book has a very limited number of suspects when Mrs. Latter dies from morphia poisoning, and it just doesn't seem that any of them could have possibly done it. Or could they have? Miss Silver is brought in to get to the truth of the matter, and you can bet she does."
4,War or Peace?,"Bernard Wiesberger shows the world an interesting view of the Cold War. Beginning with the History that started it and following through to most of Reagans Presidency. His view were unbiased and showed both sides as fairly as possibe. He tells how this 40 odd years of ""war"" changed the world. From the presidency of America to the government of Iran. This book is an interesting book if you would like to learn about the Cold War. I would reccommend it to any one above 10th or 11th grade."
4,Good survey of New Deal in West,"Lowitt's book is a survey of New Deal legislation and how it pertains to the seventeen states comprising the American West. The book is arranged topically, rather than chronologically, which keeps specific subjects contained for easier study. By concentrating on the effects of legislation, Lowitt easily demonstrates how the New Deal changed the West, both immediately and long term (dammed rivers or farm subsidies, anyone?). He supplies the reader with enough information about the problems that plagued the region, so his explanations of how New Deal programs tackled those problems are quite clear. Lowitt's style is flowing, and this makes for an easy and engaging read. Although there are a few shortcomings, this book is a good survey, and is a valuable departure point for those interested in delving into the New Deal and its impact on the American West."
4,Heads up is what it is all about.,This book is the best book for mental preperation on baseball. It gives it to you straight out and does not make it confusing. It is a must for any baseball players looking for an edge.
5,great read,"very usefull for coaches. Had many good ideas, which were easy to put into use. Also had written exercises for players to use."
5,beautifully written,"This is a wonderful book, a collection of short stories with inter-relating characters and story lines that weave in and out and tie the stories together. Hauntingly written, there were times that I was just stunned by the talent of Menendez.I could not give it a higher recommendation. Magnificently done."
3,Touching but ...,"This book was of interest to me mainly because of the subject matter. The experience of the characters helped me to think of those of my own family. The book is a series of short stories and the author gives us the best in the beginning. Ana Menendez has a wonderfully descriptive way of writing and that helps as you try to understand the feelings of her characters. Unfortunately, the last four stories were confusing and not entirely easy to comprehend. I felt as if she kept forgeting to give us valuable pieces of information which in turn made for frustrating reading!"
1,Not my kind of book,"I can definitely see how some people would enjoy this book, but it didn't do much for me. I felt some stories were too long winded, especially the one where the husband is having a sleepless night and keeps worrying about his wife's faithfulness to him. It was torture trying to get through that and other stories. Sure, the author could write beautifully, but I didn't feel like I learned anything from the stories or the novel as a whole. A disappointing read."
3,In Cuba I was a German Shepherd,I walked through a bookstore years ago and a yellow cover with the title In Cuba I was a German Shepherd stared me in the eye and I stopped to read a few pages. Some days ago I rediscovered it in one of my bookshelves and decided to look it over. It is diverse collection of easy to read short stories about Cuban immigrants. From the first one where Maximo tells jokes to hide his emotional pain while playing dominoes in Miami's Calle Ocho to tasting the guavas in the last story during Lisette's visit to Her Mother's House in Cuba. Some of the stories are better written than others. But they provide a good understanding of the nostagia and emotional pain felt by a Cuban American community that has been estranged from their homeland by the Castro dictatorship.
1,Misleading ad...arrived damaged and didn't work,"I ordered this light because it advertised that it came with ""growth bulbs"" (T8's florescents). This is true--but misleading, too. The ""growth bulbs"" are regular old florescent lights that I can buy at the local big box store (set of two) for around $7.00.Another issue was that the product was sent to me via a long shipping route and was damaged during its time on the road. So, when I got it the shipping box was partially open and the item did not work. I contacted both Amazon and the vendor and the vendor never got back to me."
5,Light fixture,A great light fixture. It's compact in size compared to other light fixtures. Price was good and I do recommend them. I have two of them mounted above my window seat. It's nice to have blooming plants inside my house.BJ
4,works fine,"I bought this to hold one of those plant growing bulbs for a hydroponic garden. It works fine, it's a light fixture, I fail to see anything amazing about it, but there is nothing bad about it either. It's what you would expect."
1,Beware!,"In short, this memory card is a peice of crap. I tried to save something on it, in a week my game was gone. I tried selling it to Funcoland they'd only take it for six bucks because they said it was crap also. you can save yourself some time and trouble by either getting a regular memory card or dex drive instead."
1,It killed My Playstation,"When I got my Playstation, I got this memory card. After 2 Weeks it killed my playstation. and I had to get it exchanged. P.S. I couden use more than Fifteen of the blocks."
4,Massive Memory Rules!,"I currently don't own one of these memory cards. I used to until there was a breakin at my house. The card got stolen. I've read other peoples reviews of this product. Most of them thought it was junk. I too had a problem figuring out how to work the thing. But once that was mastered, I thought it was great. Yes, I too lost some games saves with this product. However, I discovered that if you plug your Playstation into a surge protector, that problem disappears. I'm telling you the truth. I never had another problem with the card after that. Seriously! 4 stars for this thing because of the learning curve involved; instead of 5."
1,The Worst Product Ever,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas (he would rather have gotten coal) and he made backups of all our games on it. We moved hours of RPGs, several Monster Rancher saves (the really good monsters we didn't want to lose), we even copied stuff for other people, and deleted them from our other cards. We had tons of data for ourselves and others, and by New Years Eve it was all gone, every last bit of it. This has to be the worst product ever, I don't know how all these people saved their games for 6 months! We couldn't even save for 6 days! ..don't waste your money on this piece of garbage."
1,I am very angered,"I bought this card ... and thought I had a really great deal for so much memory. I used it for a good 8 monthes then suddenly everything disappeared out of the blue. I was in the middle of xenogears and when I turned on my playstation the next day everything had disappeared. Definately not a good product. I should have listened and bought a Sony one, one of these will eventually break down on you."
1,This Memory Card killed my games!!,"I have had this card for a long time, when it was called MEGA MEMORY CARD. It looks the same and it sure acts the same. After entering Temple Of The Ancients in FF7, I decided to take a break. After saving and removing, I return 45 minutes later, to the oh-so-familiar screen of ""MEMORY CARD NOT FORMATTED"". Talk about pain. Today, after reaching Disc 2 of FF8, the card deletes.I have become dependant on my friends to allow me to copy their files. This thing is HORRIBLE, especially for RPG gamers. DONT BUY IT. It will ruin your RPGing experience."
1,This is a horrible product,This memory card is a pipe dream. You can not use it for very long before it gets corrupted and fails. Do not rely on this piece of junk. My advice is to not buy this thing. I thought it was great but it _WILL_ corrupt all your data and everything will be lost. Companies should pay you to take it.
2,"Yeah... start, L1, and R1 doesn't work.","I assume it's because I use this on a PS2, but I can't scroll pages at all. It hasn't erased any memory so far, but because I can only use the one page it's more like just a Massively Expensive Memory Card.Does anybody know WHEN you're supposed to press start, L1, and R1? Is it at the loading screen, the browser, when the game's already loaded...?"
1,Abysmal. Don't touch with a 10-foot pole.,"I bought this card a long time ago and have not used it since it erased every save I had ever made. A warning to anyone who might think of picking this up because of its large storage capacity: this card is the bane of every gamer's existence. It is completely unreliable. One day your data will be there, the next day it could all be gone. Mine progressed from normal function, to allowing me to use only some of the channels, to allowing me to use only one channel, to displaying an ""E"". Gee, that's helpful. Even if you did everything properly and inserted and removed it when necessary, why take the risk? It's just not worth it for an item that is evidently extremely sensitive. You can get 3 very reliable Sony cards for the [money] this costs. Do yourself a favor and don't store your games on any third-party product."
1,1440 Blocks?...They mean 0,"I saw their review ...and I was just like, WOW! 1440 BLOCKS! So, I bought it, and it won't even save. I thought mabey it was a problem in it, my friend had the same problem. DON""T BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,massive memory card 1440,I bought a massive memory card 1440 and I can't get the card to work like it should .It will not save games past the 1st 15 blocks. What am I doing wrong????????
2,Looks cool but is it really?,"This memory card may look cool but underneath that technical look it's just your average memory card. And cost more than what it's worth. You see my dad bought one acouple years ago and you still have to delete your saved games every couple of months, how bad is that. The only reason I even gave this thing a two is because it looks neat."
1,Poor Product,"When we got a Playstation two years ago, we just wanted a simple Memory Card. We couldn't understand at the time why anyone would buy one of the Sony cards. Not only did they cost more per block, but they didn't have the same storage capacity. So we bought this. What a mistake!This card is completely unreliable. It corrupted an entire season of NFL Gameday '98. The other files on it are shaky at best. Buyer beware of this garbage. It's just another example of some corporation trying to cash in with an inferior and defective product. Don't fall for it!"
1,Waste of money,"Like the other reviewer, I had one of these cards. It seemed to work fine for a while, then all of a sudden erased over a hundred hours of saved data. This happened with two cards of this type. I finally bought a Playstation memory card and have had no problems since. Save your money and just buy a real card."
1,[InterAct Massive Memory Card 1440-Jewel Case],"This is the biggest waste of money. I bought one, and every time you change ""pages"" it drops all games previously saved. I lost several games 3/4 of the way through. If Amazon would let me put 0 stars I would. Don't waste your money on this garbage"
4,Simple,"Basic, but shows you that Freehand is almost as good as Illustrator without the cool filters, but with direct Flash support (just copy your Freehand work and paste it in flash and bling bling). Some nice features with text and some good masking tips, but for someone who doesn't know much, and is looking for a no-nonsense book at a nice price."
3,Triple Game,"Game freezes up on its own from time to time. Other than that, not a bad product. The games are all classics."
2,Not bad,"I love these games, espcially 'Game of Life', but there is a problem with 'Pay Day'. At times the game just freezes and I have not idea why. I tried playing the other games first and that seemed to solve the problem, well at first it did, but it did freeze on when once and it also went a bit strange when it changed the amount for one of the players to a enormous amount so that there was no way that any other player could win. The other two games appear to be fine which is good as I love them. It's just frustrating when 'Pay Day' freezes up on you. Besides that I do love playing the other games."
2,Not too much here...,"I bought this game in order to play LIFE and Yahtzee. I've never played Payday, but there is no instruction with these games, so I don't know how to play it. Therefore, if you aren't already familiar with these games in their board game state, don't expect to learn how to play them here. Yahtzee is Yahtzee, and if you like to play it, here's a nice way to sit with your GAMEBOY ADVANCE and pass the time. As for LIFE...UGH!!! It could have been so cute and fun IF there was any detail to it at all. There's not. No mini games, no extra choices, nothing. You could just sit and keep pressing the ""A"" button, and the game would play itself. Bottom line, I've spent a few evenings on the couch in front of the television with this in my hand, but it got very boring very quickly. How disappointing! I KNOW Nintendo is capable of better."
1,terrible,well this is the game i ordered and this wasnt the game i received in the mail instead they sent me chutes and ladders candyland and memory. it was for my moms birthday and she didnt want a game for such young children she wanted the payday life yahtzee. i will probably not shop here again
4,Watch it,"I had one for about two years, and it completely messed up. I was almost done with FF7 so this stank. It worked fine until then though."
1,DO NOT BUY IT!!!,"I bought this card and it worked fine for me for a while. I saved alot of games on it. THen one day - PS just wouldn't recognize it! Like I would put the card in - and it would tell me that nothing is there!!!!! I thought may be its just my PS - so I tried my friend's, and when I got PSII - I tried that also. But No it doesn't work.All of my saves are LOST and a lot of games I have I never finished.I tried to get support from Interact - but there is none. If your card dies - its your problem, they wont help you. And ... when u r about to complete the game with everything unlocked and the best ending awaiting you - and suddenly you card is unreadable."
1,Very disappointing...,"I lost my old playstation memory card & this was about the time when they stopped selling playstation memory cards; they only sold ps2 mem. cards. So my friend sold me his old one, this InterAct Memory Card. I barely used it until recently. I've been playing my game & I got really far & then today, I tried to load my game & it said that it's ""unusable"". soooo... I pretty much spent all those hours for nothing. What a waste.I do not recommend this item."
4,OVATION,"I have had this guitar for about two months now. My first Ovation! I love the sound. It is clear, bright and when amplified totally blows away my Washburn. The thin neck took a bit of getting used to but now I am quite comfortable.As for the ""round back"" complaint (guitar slips while seated), I hardly pay attention. I don't use a strap and now I naturally just slipe the guitar back into position while I play. I don't even notice anymore!Great guitar. I am very satified."
4,"Dreamy, intense music from the future","It's a pure music, one that has long since developed a comfort level existing outside genres. There's a fluidity and grace to the music and playing here, a smoothness to the instrumental tones that constrasts interestingly with the sometimes winding paths the tunes take. Listening to this record is a refreshing, invigorating challenge. More grounded and strident than their last one, ""Zen House"", but smoother and calmer than some of their previous electric projects. A cool, confident album."
2,Good Times,"I don't really like this CD, except for the first track, the rest is boring. Too much Selvaganesh for me...over-indulgent; sounds like Shawn Lane was an afterthought."
1,To lightweight,"Used for 40 inch TV. Will not stay level, need to brace TV. Not enough vertical adjustment."
2,Poor timing for Physical Intimacy,"THis book is a pure cookie cutter novel. You've read one Historical Romance with a scoundrel/would-be governess, you've read this book. I miss the originality of Julie Garwood and Mary Jo Putney. I will say that Ms Carlyle did a great job characterizing a little girl going through her terrible twos.However the moment she chose to increase the physical intimacy was poorly chosen. The fact that the man was somewhat of a gentleman helped build his character a bit, but I totally lost interest in Esm√©e. Over all the characters weren't that engaging. I found it passable."
5,Sinfully Delightful!,1880's Great BrittanONE LITTLE SIN is a very enjoyable tale of tempting desire and finding love. You can't help but love the characters! The storyline is simple and engaging. Be sure to follow with TWO LITTLE LIES and THREE LITTLE SECRETS.
2,Flat read,"I'm disappointed with this book as well. I have loved Carlyle's past books because they were dark, sensual, humorous, and manned by vivid,unforgettable characters. Not to mention that she put her own stamp upon the Regency Historical sub-genre by exploring things that most RH authors don't. But One Little Sin is very conventional. Carlyle's stunning prose is evident, but her beautiful characterizations and use of setting flicker on and off throughout the book, leaving me unsatisfied and confused as to whom I was reading. From the beginning of book, I found myself impatient to finish it, and highly anticipating the next two books of the trilogy. Like another reviewer said; One Little Sin is merely your typical rake/governess+cute baby historical romance."
2,Didn't like the characters at all,"I agree with the other reviews that the hero seemed so gullible despite his experience at being a rake. Yet he lets this woman waltz in with a baby claiming it's his. Even though at the end it's just a ""big misunderstanding,"" I didn't like he heroine's self-righteousness. At time her Scottish accent was suppose to be a burr. Then miraculously near the end she speaks perfect English. Just did not like this book. Not believeable at all. Glad I checked it out of the library."
3,Strong heroine!,"Great beginning! The first few pages really draw the reader in. Heroine was a little too strong at times, but in the end, she won me over. Have enjoyed other books by this author more."
3,"An Adorable ""Little Sin""","Everytime I read the back cover of a romance novel, I roll my eyes - then usually buy it as I have to board a plane.It turned out to be an amusing little book. Esmee was certainly a spunky little gambler in that her ruse worked perfectly! I was particularly taken with Sir Alasdair MacLachlan! Usually I dont like charming rakes but his treatment of his supposed 'Little Sin' was rather captivating.I find men treating small children with care and angst to be very appealing. In itself, I find it very manly, and it can be learned if it is not innate. I find this very satisfying in my abuse counselling - when it works!!Nice little book. Quickly read. If I come upon the next in the trilogy, I just may give it a look see."
4,First novel of Series,'One Little Sin' by Liz Carlyle is a historian romance based around Sir Alasdair who bounces from one bed or hayloft to another with no plan for his life. Miss Esmee Hamilton arrives at his door with Alasdair daughter from an interesting curtain affair. The heartache of this story engages you to the last page. I am look forward to her next books in the series Two little Lies and Three little Secrets
3,One Little Sin,"Although I didn't like this book as well as some others of hers, I did get a kick out of parts of it. I want Miss Carlyle to know that when I was in England this past summer I wasn't invited to a ball or rout either, but I have a ball reading her books. Marilyn, Squaw Valley, CA"
3,Not as educational as I thought...,"It's cool that they got all these guys in one spot to showcase, but I thought it would explain more things. It doesn't. It's just a big showcase of everyone's most popular routines we've seen over and over. The best parts were the Beat Junkie segments (only 2), the educational break-down of the DJ by Rhettmatic (Beat Junkies), Q-Bert explaining the origins of certain scratches, Alladin being drunk and acting a fool and finally the routine Cash Money did at the end. Other than that... it isn't worth it."
4,Nice earrings,"These are nice simple earrings. My girlfriend likes them, so it was a good purchase.My only issue is that shipping them through US mail, there is no way to track the progress, but a simple e-mail to the seller, and she promptly gave me a status of the delivery."
3,Super Reader,"An elite soldier is asked to take part in problem researching sophisticated physical and mental testing, and to take university coursework as their computers direct.He finds out that more is going on than this, the creation of a mental and physical elite, going way beyond supergenius IQ into physical abilities and even immortality."
4,'The Seasons' is well worth hearing.,"Unlike the reviewer above, I think the Glazunov violin concerto is very beautiful.The performance on this issue, however, isn't memorable. Listen to Heifetz's recording or one by one of the other great soloists and you'll see what I mean. The Seasons is a varied, interesting and beautiful work, strangely absent from concert halls. There are a couple of recordings by Russian conductors/orchestras (Svetlanov, Mravinsky) which are more exciting, but the sound quality and orchestral balances are MUCH better here. I originally owned the LP and purchased the cd much later. Like me, you will likely listen to this recording and continue to enjoy it over a period of many years."
4,"Yellow, meaning american traditional :)","I used mustard for pickling the cabbage back in Russia. Was hoping to repeat same style here. I must say that it is not exactly what I expected. Powder must be mixed very well with liquid to avoid clusters of dry powder (Clusters taste sweet and like standard yellow american mustard, I hate it!!!).But final result after thorough mixing was quite decent. Next time I will try different mustard style, not yellow."
3,"not the best, but could have been worse","It looked like a Captain's hat for sure, but just cheaply made. I don't think it will stand up to much real wear outside. I was pretty disappointed."
5,Captains Hat Purchase,I am amazed and thrilled there are companies still working hard to satisfy their customers! The shipment was faster than anticipated. And the quality was better than what I expected. 5 Stars!
2,poor quality,"I purchased this as a gag gift for my brother, even though I didnt need this item to be ""top shelf"" I was not expecting it to be of such poor quality."
5,Very pleased customer!,"Absolutely loved the Captain's Hat! Arrived in a timely manner, fits great and not only do I adore it, my friends try to take it from me and want to wear it. Your service is the best!"
2,Cheap/ Bad Quality Hat,"We purchased this as a gift and should have known better by the pricing. You get what you pay for.this is more of a costume..throw-away hat. the brim was crooked and cheap cardboard like material..and the cotton is VERY cheap.If you're looking for a throw-away...or costume hat, then this is fine. If you are looking for a decent quality captain's hat, then keep looking."
1,Looks like crap,For the packaged wrinkled up No way to get the wrinkles out Looks like crap Not even close to the photo
5,this is for beginner to study semiconductor,"I'm a graduate student majoring in solid state physics in south korea. Although I bought this book to study solid state physics, materials about solid state physics are poor for me to understand the basic concept of solid state physics. This is good for undergraduate students of semiconductor beginner but poor for students to study solid state physics. This book is dealt with quantum theory and energy bands in the point of view to beginner. This book does not cover with many mathematical expressions.This book is good for you to read without stress. if you study with background about the semiconductor, then you will increase your knowledge related to the semiconductor."
4,A Little Book with a Punch,"The follow up to ""Zulu Beaded Chain Techniques"", this is a lovely book. There is a brief history of native Zulu beadwork with black and white photos. Followed by a quick ""Getting Started"" section for new beaders.Then we get to the stitches: double weave, wrapped rope, square stitch base, swag and triangle bracelet, switchback chain, and hexagon netting. The diagrams and instructions are clear and concise. A bibliography is also provided if you wish to learn more about Zulu beadwork.This book is good for beginners and up."
2,Aggravated my rosacea,Got this at the reccommendation of my esthetician because I have sensitive skin and rosacea. This product made a mess out of my face.
5,Best face sunscreen I have ever used.,I am buying my 3rd bottle of this product. It goes on very light and adds just enough color for me not to need any makeup. I do not find it greasy like other sunscreens; all it does is add a soft light to my skin.
2,inconsistent,"bought a pack of two. it was a product I am quite familiar withfirst bottle was finesecond was runny/oily (not outdated, just left in my home no temperature extremes)I did not open the second tube until I was done with the first one so it was past the return periodThe company offered me a ""discount"" of 20 a tube!it's 30 on Amazon for two.The nerve."
5,Fabulous set - but shame on Decca,"Burrows was one of the finest tenors of the second half of the 20th century - a highly versatile singer, comfortable on the operatic stage, the concert hall, recital platform, and the recording studio. All of that repertoire is represented on this set, although there is certainly an emphasis on lighter fare (so-called ""drawing room ballads""). But no one (except perhaps John McCormack) sang this material as well as Burrows. Six very well-filled discs, including a great deal of material that has been otherwise unavailable on CD or very, very hard to find.But the folks at Decca ought to be flogged for allowing this set to go out of print so quickly. I suspect that it was unavailable before most people even knew of its existence."
4,Fun with one exception,"Bought one of these to play with around my 3 year old. She loved it immediately but it drove me nuts that half the face seemed to be mal-formed causing one of the eyes to stare way off into space instead of making eye contact. I ordered another to see if it was corrected but it's was exactly the same. Could be just a flaw in the design of this model. Ah well, she still likes it all the same."
5,Great plush coyote!,"We have two of these coyote puppets in our house, as each child had to have one! It's a fun toy, really cute, and well made. I would highly recommend this plush for any animal lover!"
3,"Not for a novice, good general purpose applications",It's layout makes it hard to find what you need when you need it. It does contain a lot of information and touchs on most everything. it doesn't go as deep as I would like. It is a good referance book if you have time surf thru it's confusing index.
1,"Should be called, ""HOW TO USE WIN95""","This book focuses far too much on how to use the basic aspects of the Win95 enviroment, instead of cutting to the basics of how to use Access 97 and create anything.This is the WORST Sybex book I have ever bought."
2,Bundled software didn't work so well,"My home PC refused to read the CD ROM, my office PC read the CD ROM, but the free check book writer appears to have bugs (type mismatch errors everytime you try to print). The book is too much fluff and white space. Better off buying a empty soda bottle (for a lot of air)."
2,superficial overview of Access 97,"This book covers alot of territory with respect to Access 97. However, if you are new to relational databases and Access specifically, this book does not provide simple and coherent steps in creating databases using Access.This book was used by a university database class of which I was a part and very few students actually found the book of much help. The index is confusing and has the reader jumping from chapter 1 to 25. I wish I had read a review of this work before dropping $65.00."
1,Doesn't work?,"Plugged in the headphones, the only thing that works is the microphone... and that BARELY picks up sound, even when I increase the sensitivity via Devices options in Windows. These are also pretty uncomfortable.Cool looking, that's about it. The microphone design is nifty but its usability completely undermines this aspect."
2,Proverbs 31,"After reading 31, I get the feeling that the woman does it all, what good is a man if the woman is controlling the household? She receives verbal praises, that's not enough, why not help???????"
4,Great Book,"My small group women's Bible study went through this book together. McKinney-Hammond was funny, to the point, and had several ""ah ha"" moments. The questions at the end of the chapter for men, women, and couples were thought provoking and practical, as well. This was a great read and I'd definitely recommend it to others if they're wanting to become a better man or woman of God."
4,History,"Great history of mans attempt to tame nature. First attempts to controll the swmp, and then efforts to save the area. Good read for those who live in he area and want to understand the current situation."
1,This product sucks,"Purchased this product and had it installed. Two months later, this product has failed, and my window for returning this piece of junk has expired. Very disppleased"
5,Dona,"As a freshman in high school I was priviledged to perform with the CSUF University Singers and the Pacific Chorale, myself being a member of the Pacific Youth Chorale. We performed Dona Nobis Pacem and it was one of the most moving pieces ever performed. From the sadness of the Dirge for two veterans, to the uplifting ending of the final movment. This piece is one of the most beautiful out there."
5,Excellent glass cleaner,"This glass cleaner can be used on cars, trucks, vans, windows, and china cabinet glass. What ever the purpose to use glass cleaner this is the product."
2,Too Convoluted for the author to handle,"I read one of the author's other works, ""The Miracle Game"" and enjoyed it. This book, however, is inferior to it in every way. The author is not able to handle length of this project. Characters enter and leave the narrative without much explanation, and it becomes almost impossible to keep track of them. Stylistically, this is not his best work. The writing is not as tight (this could be the fault of the translation, I'm not sure).He has an interesting idea: structure the narrative around famous American writers. Its not entirely original but could be very fun and revealing. He fails with this idea. He hardly works these writers into the narrative, and it becomes hardly more than a prop.If you want to read his work, I'd recommend ""The Miracle Game."""
2,alien cargo?????,"when i picked up this movie to rent,I thought it would be a cheap ripoff of Aliens,but when I watched it I was very dissapointed. First of all there are no aliens in the entire movie and the cargo was not even alien. the ending was sad,because the only characters you care about have a very short life span. the few redeeming qualities were the special effects and many times throughout the movie,the characters were extremely good. If you are a sci-fi fan ,you should see this movie sometime. i recommend you rent this one before you buy it."
5,superb arrangements of beautiful music,This CD is a must for all lovers of music. The arrangements by Rechtman are superbly performed by the greatest instrumentalists. There is a surprise for everyone in each of the 4 unique CDs.The recorded sound is clear and gives one the feeling of being in attendance at a live performance.I am looking forward to hearing more from these distinguished Israeli artists and friends - all members of the Israeli Philharmonic and Chamber Orchestras.The booklet notes are informative and educational and are a source of the insight into the composers' working mind.
3,good enough,"although its not your typical dark and catchy dance rift apop, it is a good lead into the new era of rock/dance.it is good enough to buy."
2,rack is a beast..............,"BUT THE BAG SUCKS..BIG TIME WHAT A FLIMSY PEICE O CRAP, AND THERES NO ""QUICK RELEASE"" AT ALL 4 ALLEN HEAD SCREWS IS NOT QUICK, IM WICKED DISSAPOINTED TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. ILL BE BUYING A TOPEAK BAG TOMMOROW, IF YOU CANT MAKE A BAG, ID SUGGEST YOU DONT SELL BAGS. SEEMS EASY ENUFF."
2,Delta bicycle seat post rack,tThe quickbag easily doubles as carry on for air lines. However I think it put my center of gravity too high and was the cause of a recent bicycle crash when I hit a slight deviation in the road. The crash caused a broken pelvis. I have traveled many thousands of miles around the world by bike and have never had a crash. Until I bought the Delta Maga Rack Post and Quickbag I had used panniers which are much lower. However the bicycle I was using was not equiped for a rack and panniers.
3,"Great tech blog, poor Kindle read","I like TechCrunch. Their articles are accurate, timely, and relevant. They are also simply blurbs with a link (or many) to their source. While that's awesome for a web-based platform, following those links on the Kindle is an exercise in pain.If you're looking for a tech blog to read on the Kindle, try Ars Technica. They cover a lot of the same topics as TechCrunch (and their articles are often linked to by TC), but the articles are self-contained and complete even without following the links sprinkled throughout.TC does tend to be more timely than Ars, but Ars is the better Kindle read."
1,Bad reading experience,"For reading on a Kindle is great, but reading TechCrunch on a Kindle is more and more terrible. Reasons:1, When reading a blog post, you will sometime read the ""read more..."" link, forcing you to open the web browser to read the next part, which will make you crazy for opening browser on Kindle and opening a webpage is painfully slow.2, Recently I found to clip an article of TechCrunch is disabled, for every time I clip an article, I'm prompted that reaching the clip limit. SighAs I pay $1.99/mon for reading the blog while the web readers pay nothing, I could not do the same things as the others. While Tech world always talk about openness, TEchCrunch set so many limitation for their Kindle fans.Maybe I should give up reading TechCrunch on Kindle. Very bad experience."
3,Quick Review of TechCrunch,"Blog contains articles on various topics relating to internet technology with focus on social networking sites. Blogs included product releases, industry news and website recommendations during the two week trial. Decided to not renew this subscription since I seek articles on corporate IT issues."
4,STILL THE BEST,I have tried most of the Tech Blogs and I still find this one the best. They always have the most current issues and I like how it is presented.
2,"not for the casual tech nerd, this is serious...","Not what I expected, This Way too serious, very bussiness orientated, (aka...for me ...Boring) I like Gizmodo better, Gizmodo has got good info on alot of personal tech news."
5,"Funny, funny and bipartisan","Funny, funny little book! Some real laugh out loud jabs at both Republicans and Democrats.Perfect for your political friends as a gift."
5,political humor,This was a gift for my impossible to buy for older brother. It was great esp since i'm a republican and he is a democrat.
2,Wasn't funny-found offensive.,Was not funny to me - I found it offensive. I did not find it accurate to either party's true values or views.
1,Beware! Copyright disc!,"Great disk, but completely useless. This disk is copyrighted and I cannot put it on my IPOD. Just be warned..."
3,Juliet can really belt it out,"More of a dance maven than a rock chick, Juliet still manages to hypnotize you with electronic beats, repetitive vocal hooks, and hints of guitar fuzz. Unlike her some of her dance house peers, Juliet can really belt it out when she wants to."
3,Poor Navigation,"I found this DVD hard to navigate. The links were difficult to spot and not labeled well. At first I thought it was mostly a perfomance DVD and gave it a poor review for it's instructional qualities. After a couple more viewings, I was able to locate the links to the instructions and did find it useful."
2,Not for beginners.,The DVD is definitely not for those who are just starting out. It's not what I expected.
4,Fantastic,With 36 pages (like having 36 memory cards) of memory it is the best thing I bought for my playstation. You never need to worry about running out of memory again. Well worth the price.
4,Very useful item that will not be replaced!,"This is a great item if you have many games. It will hold a lot of memory for every game. It will cause little hassle and is cheap for its usage. It is a good bargain and I would recommend getting this. For anyone who is into Playstation games, this is a mut have for saving data!"
1,Not worth your money,"There is too many requirements to work ONE card.I saved a Gran Turimo 2 game on it, and the next day, it wasn't there. It erased it. :o( Don't waste your money this card."
4,Dont buy,"I believed that this memory card would be a good deal because of the amount of memory, and it is good until it just decides to erase everything and really piss you off. All I have to say is DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
2,"Don't buy, this card is unreliable","I had this card for a year or two (I lost track) then suddenly, it deleted itself. One year's worth of saves, gone like that. I thought that maybe it was some sort of fluke, so I reformatted it and started over. Well, a month later the memory card deleted itself again. All right, maybe this was some freak occurrence. I tried again, more cautious now. Then, before my eyes, the memory card wiped itself again. I paid [alot of money] for this thing, and it isn't even a good paperweight anymore. I expected better.I gave it 2 stars based on the fact it held up for a year."
1,Annoying,"In order to use this card, you have to insert the included CD to make the PS2 recognize it. Once the software's menu pops up you must hit the START button, eject the CD, put in your game, and hit X. This is a rather annoying requirement, and one that's a showstopper for me. I'd much rather have a card that's compatible with Sony's own that I don't have to play tricks with to work.Unfortunately, the packaging doesn't tell you this on the outside -- it's only after you open it up that you realize it!"
2,I also have had problems,"I have had this card for about 2 years now. In that time, it has totally crashed twice. For the most part, it works well with a lot of space. I just don't think I can handle going through all of Final Fantasy VII again with this card."
3,"This is okay, if you really need it...","I think that this is a good product to buy if your game takes up a lot of space on your card. The major problem I had with it, though, was that if I overwrote files too many times, I wouldn't be able to accessany of the other cards unless I deleted everything on the card and reformatted it. This is why I suggest that if you get this memory card, you have a regular 15 block memory card that is blank. (This card is NOT compatible with PS2 games, just like any other PS1 memory card, but it can still be used to save and load your old PS1 games on PS2, just like any other cards) I just needed to clear that up."
1,The Agony of Lost Games.......,"I owned this card for my Playstation and completed 70% of Spyro the Dragon to find out the card FAILED. One day all my saves are there, the next everything has vanished, wiped out to gaming oblivion. Plus it would never accept another save ever again. Very CHEAPLY made product, save your money and spend a little extra on the good stuff."
1,"It has it's merits, but...",It was perfect for the first few months. Then one day it was blank. No explanation to be found. It's done this to me a few times. Since then I've stopped using it unless I don't have any other free memory cards.
1,anybody have the instruction booklet for this memorycard??,"well it has done it again, the memory card crashed for the eighth time this week. I threw away the instruction booklet accidentally, now it has a w on top of the number, and i can't save anything in it anymore. if you have the instruction booklet, please email me at libra10m@hotmail.com... i'm stuck with this no good product. i do not recommend anybody buying this product, especially if you are a gamer...."
1,Unreliable product,"I thought this was the perfect card, but after a few months, it got stuck and I could only access one of the 24 compressed cards. Gone were all my beloved GT1 and GT2 cars, gone was half of Tomb Raider Chronicles. I had to do it all again. I tried again and again for weeks, then gave up, and then suddenly, after 3 months, it worked again. Let's just say that I quickly bought two new, uncompressed cards, and I transferred all my stuff in them. Don't make the same mistake I made! Don't buy this card!"
4,Must Have,"This is a great memory card. 360 block for only the price of two 15 block memery cards. If you play alot of games this is for you. Just don't go looking for more blocks, the higher you go, the greater the risk of losing your saves. If you protect you cards it will last you a long time. Mine lasted a year, but it wasn't child proof : ( So treat you cards right and it will treat you the same : )"
4,bunch o' memory,"This thing might take you a little while to figure out (minecame without instructions) but it's a good tool if you save alot. Youjust have to remember to switch between blocks, and which block you saved a game on when trying to load. All and all a good bye for the money, because it just got [lots of] memory."
1,Be careful...,It seems quite a few of these have problems. I have followed all the instructions and mine still deletes games. It's great there's lots of memory but keep one empty block for when its time to reformat. Reformatting on a block with saved games will erase those games so be careful
4,A bridge between his stories for children and adults,"Preface: I love almost everything by Dahl.This collection is a nice bridge between his stories for children, and his stories for adults. For example, in his story ""The Ratcatcher"", Dahl's use of language and detail is more similar to his children's stories. However, the story is more grown-up, and told at a pace more similar to the stories in, say, _Switch, Bitch_.It is an enjoyable collection. More consistently strong than his _Tales of the Unexpected_, some of which are quite weak."
3,Enjoyable read but reference book it is not.,"I found the Illustrated Directory of Harley-Davidson Motorcycles a very informative and enjoyable read, but field guide or reference book it is not- less a reference book/ field guide and more of a non-fiction novel about Harley Davidson.It required you to read it chronologically and is not very handy as an identification guide (there is no more than one picture per model listed). You have to read several pages before the page you are reading to really get what the author is talking about."
5,awesome!,i love happy harcore! anabolic frolic! scott brown! hixxy! this is a great compilation for the price and a must have for any lover of the genre!
2,fascinating material marred by slapdash editing,"Kessler seems to have known everyone in the Weimar who's who, and then some. Against the pleasure of seeing Kessler's rather elevated world through his eyes one must weigh the failure of the editor, whether by whimsy, laziness, or poor judgment, to explain the persons and events the author mentions or to provide any narrative arc. The editor feels obliged to tell us who Johann Strauss was but fails to document important participants like the politicians Walter Rathenau and Viscount d'Abernon. I recommend this book to those with an interest in the period but lament the lack of amenities for the reader."
5,Good product at a cheap price,Not sure what these other reviewers are smoking but i have over 40 of these and i never had to remove the disk to format it and none have failed.
5,Built like a tank.,"Purchased this after reading all the positive reviews and glad I did. All the good things said about this sub are true. Hard to believe it sounds as good as it does for only a 6 inch sub. I have had sub enclosures before with 2 tens and this sounds as good if not better. This sub will not rattle the hinges on your trunk loose but it does provide a solid, tight, clean sounding bass. One attribute that I have not seen others comment on is how well built this is. Its very durable. You could stand on this thing and not damage it! Well done Bazooka."
5,Bazooka BTA6100 BT Series 6-Inch 100-Watt Amplified Tube Subwoofer,"94' Chevy x-tra cab. With only the 4x6 plate speakers, (upgraded with amp) still needed to fill the lows. Awsome! Easy hook-up though wires seem smaller than gauge? 6"" w/100amp really rounds out the sound, as loud as you'll want."
5,Booming Bass Sound,"Size doesn't matter with the Bazooka. Compact, 100 watt unit BOOMS, it will make your rearview mirror vibrate/shake if you want it to. The tube plastic housing seems very durable and also gives off bass sound. Built in amp is a plus, installation is straight forward and simple. The rear sound/volume level control is a snap to adjust to taste, the all in-one quick disconnect cable makes it super easy to unplug and move the tube if you need the cargo space. I shopped around, nobody beats the AMAZON price."
4,Nice sound and price!,"For being a small all in one unit, it works very well. It is well designed and the attachments made the install very easy! Longest time was hiding the wires. Has nice bass and can be adjusted. Price was very affordable."
3,"Relatively small, tight bases","I spend quite some time trying to imagine the size of the woofer (as I am originally from Europe and am still struggling with the inch to cm conversion. I have Chrysler Crossfire, so wanted to be 'savy' with the space in the trunk, so I've opted at the end for the smaller 6 1/2' one. Well that was probably not the best choice. I have replaced my factory radio (Infinity) with the Alpine IDA-X305 iPod player, and the car has 6 good speakers, so to my surprise, adding the smaller woofer didn't made too much difference to the sound. Yes there are little bit deeper and stronger bases, but unfortunately for me the difference was probably not worth the money. I even went few times to check whether the woofer is playing - and yes it is, btu as I said it is almost hard to say the difference. So if you find yourself with making same decision - go with the bigger one. Btw - it would fit into my car's trunk at the end as well. :-(("
1,Not another page. PLEASE!,"This book had a great title and came recommended to me by a professor at Utah State University. I whish I could say how educational it was or how it held my attention, but I had a hard time getting through just about ever page I read. You would need a list a mile long to keep up with the abbriviations used by the author. I know there are a lot of abbreviations used in the government and private sectors of natural resource managment, but having a degree in Natural Resources didn't prepare me to keep up with this one. Usually no matter how uninteresting a book is you can get by if you have to. I just couldn't keep going with it through the end."
3,a little flimsy,"The whole fixture is a little flimsy, and flexes very easily, making the lights flicker or go out. The included hooks are too short, and I had to adapt them to ensure it hangs stable, and the power cable is quite short. Overall, while this does what it has to do, it isn't a very effective grow-light, and I would rather spend more and get something better next time."
2,Cheap light,Light worked for about 8 months and then one side stopped working. I picked up another one @ wally world for eight bucks and it came with the thinner flourescent bulbs. This one does not come with bulbs. I would not recommend this if you have it always on. Shop around there are better deals out there.
1,Read it if you like crazy books,"I don't remember how it was that I first heard about this book, but when I read all the reviews, I knew I _had_ to have it, just to see how bad it really was.Between mandatory virginity loss, sex at every ritual and male sponsors making wooden dildos for their neophytes, ""The Good Witch's Bible"" HAS to be the most screwed up Wicca/Witchcraft book out there. And that just _scratches_ the surface of the nutty beliefs outlined in this book!I don't care HOW brilliant you think the Frosts are...this book is WRONG!"
1,"Filth, Garbage and sexual perversion.","True Witchs would NEVER practice any of the degeneracy in this outhouse standby.This filth is not Witchcraft or Wicca but alot closer to devil worship.People who rape or molest children in any way shape or form should be stripped, beaten and then burned alive, not true Witchs.These twisted sick perverts should be punished with extreme prejudice for advocating this swill.Buy the Farrars Witchs Bible, or Bucklands complete Book Of WitchCraft or anything by Scott Cunningham but dont ever by anything which promotes more pain and anguish in poor little childrens lives, namely this book and anything by the frost's."
1,This book should be added to the adult fiction section if sold at all!,"This is Book (I use the word 'book' lightly) is not somthing I would hope that anyone looking for info on Wicca or Witchcraft would read. It gives us a bad name. I HAVE NEVER FOUND INFO LIKE THIS BEFOR. And I hope I never do agen. Shure all religons have there bad seeds but these people...They go beyond, I dont know how this book could be out there w/ out sending the wrighters to jail."
1,This book advocates child molestation,"I'm all for free speech but this book contains material that is beyond comprehension including a ritual where the Frosts advise a father of a 12 year old girl to help create a wooden phallus, show her how to use it then offer his 12 year old child to the High Priest of the coven for sexual intercourse. There is no DEFENSE to sick, twisted material such as this. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! These people should be locked up."
1,An Unfortunate Mistake,"When this book came out in the early 70s, it was considered abject nonsense by the few folks who had any actual knowledge of Wicca in those days. The Frosts came out of nowhere, appropriating the term 'Wicca' for their own version of what religious witchcraft might be. Their synthesis bore almost no resemblance to the traditions of Wicca, either in ritual or theology, and certainly not in the grotesque suggestions about the sexual upbringing of children. It was a different age in those days, as 'swinging' emerged as a lifestyle and many folks hoped for a real revolution in sexual mores - too bad the Frosts chose to add their wacky ideas to something that they chose to call 'Wicca'.This book was an embarrasment in 1972, and it's an embarrasment now. It should be ignored by anyone interested in learning witchcraft or wicca."
1,Aberration,"Rarely does one book spark such violent opposition. This is one of the most misguided works I have come across. It has nothing to do with any form of Wicca I have come across, and serves only to malign serious followers of the religion. From blatantly incorrect to sick and twisted, the Frosts seem to have created a work of fiction here."
1,"Not just disturbing, despicable!","If I could give this book less than one star I would, if I could give it negative stars I would. I had heard about the controversy surrounding this text and not being a mindless drone I decided to read for myself and come to my own conclusions. All I can say is that these people are sick and they have no place representing the pagan community. They advocate child molestation and incest. I cringe when I think of what may have already been carried out under their tutelage since this book has been in publication so long. I am so upset I don't know what else to say. Except that I will not be buying any books by them or published by their publishers until their books are removed from publication."
1,Burn this piece of crap,"I have read bits and pieces of this book and it horrified me. Yes, there is a little bit of decent information, but that same information can be found in other books that do not advocate child molestation.As for Baloney Buster's claims, no the Frosts were not the pioneers of Wicca in America. That distinction belongs to Raymond Buckland who brought it over from England LONG before the Frosts published this piece of tripe.THIS IS NOT REAL WICCA! THIS IS A PERVERSION OF A BEAUTIFUL RELIGION THAT DOES NOT ADVOCATE HARMING CHILDREN OR ANY OTHER INNOCENT CREATURE!"
2,Deceptive Advertising,"The shirt I received was tissue-thin and the graphic is much smaller than the one the photo above (and looks like a third generation xerox copy). Plus the fit was very weird (tight in the arms and upper torso). The large was more like a medium. In short, this is a very low quality shirt at a very high price. Shame, because the Evel design is awesome. I expect this piece of junk to fall apart after two or three washings. I feel ripped off big time."
1,it is not a shirt a propose its a thing for my wife for sleeping,I order this shirt for me also it fits not it is to big and the arms are to short.
3,"second review is correct,","the book has little for inspiration, and some chapters have items that are really dated and silly looking ( ex: accessories )BUT, the rug ideas are solid ( there are five ) you can see the possibilities in them, and the directions are clear and easy to follow. there is no information here, though, that you cant find online."
4,"Review of Teach Us, Amelia Bedelia",I remember this book from when I was young and I remember thinking how fun it would be if there was a teacher like Amelia Bedelia. This book is fun for kids in first grade to read since that's the grade Amelia Bedelia is teaching. Everything she does throughout the day makes you laugh and wonder how anyone could do that. Throughout the story she follows the instructions left for her but her common sense is lacking which makes the story so fun. Her innocence wins you over. Amelia Bedelia will make you feel better if you have ever done something mindless likes she does over and over.
5,Why pay that much???,"I LOVE THIS GAME!! It was one of the best games I have ever played as a otaku(anime freak) It is really nice to pick the guy that you ""want"":P!This game is a reverse harem (meaning that it is one girl surrounded with HOT guys:P) I LOVE this games but it is WAY TO MUCH MONEY!! I don't know if amazon will let me post this link but here is the full game for FREE!!!! [...] (BEST SITE EVER:D)"
4,"Agreement, corrections","Musically, this one is just fine.I agree about the annoying voice-overs. They would be more appropriate if we were listening to country music.The Mendelssohns were born in this order: Fanny, Felix, Rebekka, and then Paul."
4,"Not exactly glamorous, does what it needs to do","Computer folks love to talk about the latest, greatest hard drives, flat-panel monitors, video cards and the like. Little mention is made of basic utilitarian components such as this.That said, the Adaptec DuoConnect AUA-3020 provides solid performance and system expansion and does it well, while calling no particular attention to itself. With its own power connector, this card allows a practically unlimited number of USB/FireWire devices to be connected to a computer.I've connected a printer, a scanner, and two external hard drives to this device and download digital camcorder DV via FireWire. All connected devices communicate stably, quickly, and reliably, freeing up my front-panel USB ports for other devices such as digital cameras and flash drives.If you need additional USB or FireWire ports, this Adaptec device is the answer."
2,Not for speed freaks,"I have the AUA 3020A which is different from the picture. There's 1 firewire, 3 USB and a smaller square USB port. I bought this to upgrade to the faster USB 2.0 for my Mac Quicksilver 2002. However, you will only get the USB 1.1 speed as noted at the Adaptec website. The Mac hardwired Firewire is considerable faster than the PCI based Firewire. Great if you need more ports but not faster speed. I rated this a 2 star because the label is somewhat misleading for Mac users looking for USB 2.0."
5,great for moose collectors,I have a moose bedroom and he looks great sitting on the bed. I haven't had a chance to use him in a puppet play but I think he will be very expressive. Very nice quality.
3,"Lights work great, but come with some bad batteries","These lights are basically toys; don't expect any real durability here; the shell is plastic. That being said, when they have good batteries there are surprisingly bright!Unfortunately mine came with a bunch of bad batteries -- what a waste! Once I put good batteries in, they worked well.Keep in mind you need to manually turn these on and off; there are other kinds that will automatically turn on when you start biking. It's up to you which you would prefer."
2,hardened up on me,"I bought a big box of this that would last me several months. Before I got through it all, it hardened up like a rock. If I tried to break it up and use it anyway, I would find pieces left over after the wash that didn't even dissolve and were like little rocks. I don't know if the humidity would do this to any powdered detergent, but I'd never seen it happen. Had to throw about 1/3 of the box out. So I recommend the liquid version."
2,Doesn't dissolve,"Like others, I really wanted this to work out. I love SG's diapers and many other products. But the powder cakes up, and just does not dissolve in our hard water. I have to crumble it up in my hands to an almost talc-like consistency and mix it into the water, which has to be at least warm, then add clothes - THEN it does a good job and does not leave detergent ""rocks"" or white stains on the clothes. Unfortunately that's a little too much effort. It cleans well when it dissolves, so maybe it's fine for soft-water areas."
3,"Great, but they just changed the formula","I'm now on my third case of this detergent from Amazon. When this case arrived I noticed it had a strong mildew smell to it. I called the company this morning about it and they said they've recently added an anti-sudsing ingredient that causes the mildewy smelly. Gross! Now the product is good for regular and high efficiency machines, but it comes with a stinky smell. Good news is the clothes don't end up smelling like it, but my laundry room does. I have four boxes to get through, but after that might have to start looking for another product."
5,"Dissolves and cleans even in cold, hard water","The title pretty much says it. I can't imagine using a non-environmentally friendly detergent when an alternative like this is available. Our water is hard, and this detergent dissolves and works well even for cold water wash. Kudos to 7th Gen also for disclosing all ingredients in their products."
1,seventh generation laundry detergent,"I have tried both the powder and liquid Seventh Generation Laundry detergents. Both have bleached color out of clothing items. The first time the company reimbursed me for the cost of the clothes, and told me they were removing the words ""color fast"" from the product labels (they did). Now that it has happened again I will not be using this product in the future."
5,Works for me,"I have been using this laundry detergent for a while now and have not had any problems. Some detergents would make me itch, others did not work to well. This one does not bother my skin at all and cleans as good or better than most others. I like being able to buy it in bulk as well. Shipped just fine."
4,Laundry detergent,I found 7th Generation laundry detergent to be great. It go our clothes clean and makes me feel good that I'm not hurting us or our environment.
4,Good,"This is a good detergent. But since I prefer natural soaps, I am looking for ""fragrance-free laundry soap"". They are out there on Google."
5,A touts les glories de la France,"Most American designers who would persuade that they present us with so called 'French' design, actually show us American interiors with a few traditional French furniture pieces thrown in the loupe - but this doesn't make them French. (Generally they come across more English country house, really; chintz et al.) Jacques Garcia is very different! He knows the traditional interiors of France as if they are tattooed blueprints on his mind; the panelling, floors, carvings, mantles, proportions, the furniture and accessories, fabrics, architecture and art - but most importantly he has that extremely rare ability to know those idiosyncratic and intangible differences, those transcendent and ethereal distinctions of the French intellect regarding aesthetics. He has found the French soul and is sharing it with you. It is not even slightly American! If you wish to know what France IS see Garcia's book!"
5,"book, 'Snow Day' review",The book was purchased for a mentally handicapped adult who is intrigued by large construction equipment. He is thoroughly enjoying his new book. It also encourages verbal responses which are normally hard to get from him. I have a 4 year old 'grandcousin' who also enjoys the book immensely!
5,Every night before bed,"This is the only book my 2 year old son wants to do anymore. The story we don't even read...BORING story. Great things to do in it. HE LOVES, LOVES this book. Fun for momma and baby boy!"
5,Vespro Della Beata Vergine by Musica Fiata,"Roland Wilson is American born cornett player and conductor now lives in Germany where he conducts his own orchestra Musica Fiata. He has made quite a name for himself in the field of large scale Baroque music. Here he turns to little known Vespers music of Biber. Compositions are variously scored for voices,brass and strings and here he adds a few Biber's compositions for strings and brass. The result is simply breathtaking"
2,Mediocre at best,"Although we loved civilization, we found this add-on difficult to work with. The scenarios weren't clearly layout out. We tried all of the scenarios and didn't find a single one we enjoyed. We've since returned to the original game but never to this supplement. Definitely not worth the money."
3,"Long, Strategic, and Involved","This review focuses mainly on the game, not the add-on. This game has room for many strategies, but takes at bare minimum 10 hours to complete. Essentialy, you control a world power in a randomly generated planet. You control diplomacy, city management, government, and much more. There are so many things that must be controlled, and it takes a while to get the hang of it. Each unit, quite unrealistically, takes at least 10 one-year turns to encircle the globe. It's mainly a game of military dominance. The add-on includes several scenarios, with different units, technologies, etc., and a scenario builder. The scenario builder takes a long time and never seems to work. I recommend Civilization 2: Fantastic Worlds for people who enjoy strategy and have a LOT of free time on their hands."
2,Would not recommend for a 6.5 speaker.,"Ordered these to help with replacing the 6.5 inch speakers in my 1997 Dakota extended cab. The adapters lined up perfectly with my vehicle, but I had two brands of a standard 6.5 speaker and neither would fit in this adapter. I was only able to get them to work by using a drill and hacking something together. A 5.25 speaker looks like it would easily fit. I would not recommend these for a 6.5 speaker."
5,fantastic!,"this shuttle is just fantastic! the external pockets really come in handy for other stuff that i need to bring with me [i.e. cd's, charger, cables] without having to use a separate bag. it fits my hp pavilion tx1000 perfectly. when not in use, it's thin enough to roll or fold to be kept compactly. i'd definitely recommend this product!"
4,Great sleeve great price,"Fits new Aluminum 13.3"" MB. Not perfect but pretty close. I like the outer sleeve to hold the MagSafe adapter, a small pair of in-ear headphones, and the cloth that comes with the computer. I feel more secure when I have my computer in my backpack."
2,does not fit snuggly indeed!,"This product DID NOT fit my laptop (13.3"" mac) snuggly enough. It moves around a lot, thus lowering its purpose to PROTECT my laptop. I just kept it because I did not want to go through the trouble of shipping it back and researching for another 4 hours on a good laptop case. The only pro about this is that it can fit a LOT of stuff in its pocket. Be careful though, b/c since you're putting stuff in the pocket (top), the top of your laptop faces the bottom of the case... thus reducing the protection of the laptop case yet again. I suggest for customers to just buy one in-store."
4,Great for the Mac Air user!,"This is a great way to prevent scratches, etc. on the Mac Air if you prefer to keep it in a backpack, etc. Easy zipper opening and I like the outside pocket to hold the adapter, etc. It does not fit snug but serves the purpose of protecting your investment."
2,So much for that......,"Here is the good:I recieved my darts in the mail before the estimated ship date. Packaging contained everything I ordered. Darts look great just like the picture.Now for the bad:The very first time I threw the dart at the board I had a bounce out. No bigdeal, I threw my next 2 darts and went to pick up the first dart. This is where the trouble started. The steel tip (point) of the dart was completely broken off! Not just a portion of the point, the whole thing was broken. It looks like the break occured inside the barrel. I dont know if it was just bad luck on my part or faulty product. My game was haulted after LITERALLY the very first throw of these new darts. I think these darts are an ok product, attractive design and decent shipping time. I just hope your product does not break like mine did."
4,Oh Mamma,"An interesting debut from this young Swedish quartet, pouring out instrumental progressive rock that reminds quite a bit of Samla Mammas Manna (which is a GOOD thing, believe me). Keyboardist David Lundberg (Rhodes, Mellotron, synthesizers) is quite a dynamic player and Mathias Danielsson plays some great slide guitar a la Coste Apetrea. They could use a few more time signature changes for my taste, sometimes slowing down to the point of belaboring the music (whereas SMM often plays so fast that you can barely follow them) - but there's enough really great stuff here to want to keep an eye on them for sure."
5,a great gift,"I gave this as a gift to a friend of mine who not only has a new baby, but just passed the bar exam. I also included a onesie with a neck-tie sewn on (like father like son). Very cute gift and a big crowd pleaser."
1,Not what you got on TV,"Just record the 2-hour biography episode off the TV because this is a MUCH abbreviated 50-minute version not worth looking at. All the really thoughtful, insightful interviews were cut and all the tabloid junk we've heard a million times left in. Hopefully a better version will be released."
1,Biography Johnny Depp,"I cancelled this order since I already had this DVD with a different front cover so I did not receive this product. Please check your records. Thanks, Mitzi Heim"
2,False Advertising,"If you read Robert's other book, The Power of Strategic Thinking, there is absolutely no reason to read this one. He (and McGraw Hill) put out the same book under two separate titles. Based upon its title, I was expecting the book to focus entirely on e-strategy and provide some innovative, insightful and applicable information. Instead, there was little or nothing ""new under the sun"" imparted in this book that he didn't already tell us in The Power of Strategic Thinking - which by the way is the much better book of the two. If you want information on e-strategy, save your money and look elsewhere. Jim Altfeld, Altfeld, Inc. Strategic Corporate, Marketing & Sales Planning."
1,Information Dated,"I purchased this for my son and his wife for their new baby. Both said I should have saved my money as there was no ""new"" information they could use. Other parents might find it more helpful. They said the program had a total 80's feel with old information. The program showed babies being put to sleep face-down on a fluffy bed surrounded with toys."
4,Terrific performance of underrated symphony,"Everyone knows Dvorak's 8th and 9th symphonies, and probably the 7th too. But his First Sym. is a pure delight and deserving of much greater fame. Colorful, passionate, inventive--promising great things to come. Jarvi's performance does it complete justice--red-blooded and headlong. Just a lovely, lovely disk. One of my very most fave Dvorak recordings."
2,An Eastern Western,"This is a shoot-up in the old Zane Grey style......lots of swash and buckle. The setting may be the rugged outback of Anatolia in the 1920's but the plot is pure horse-opera. Scarcely worth the time of day for a grownup, alas.John Truman NYC"
3,"oh, well...","This particular one is a good book, but be warned about the sequels (of which there are three): Kemal's tendency to describe the countryside, the flowers, grass, horses, whatever, in excruciating detail increases as the series progresses. Since (as far as I understand) the same plot is recycled in all four books, it may be a good idea to stop at number one."
2,OK product,"I'm familiar with Peltor products. This headset has great hearing protection, one of the best I've used. But the ""listen only"" part leaves something to be desired. I bought these to use in my woodshop. There are times when I have repetitive work and like to listen to my mp3 player. I found 2 problems with these using for that purpose.1. The cord is too short. When I plug them into my ipod and put the player in my back pocket, i'm constantly pulling the plug out2. The volume is too low. I know, I know, you're supposed to keep the volume low, but when the ipod is on full volume, you can barely hear it in the headphones, regardless of whether the machinery is running or not.Result, I bought a different pair of headphones for that purpose. I'll probably keep these around for hearing protection, but don't buy them if you intend to use them with an MP3 player. I even tried using them with an amplifier made for headphones, to no avail."
1,Missed opportunity for functional product,"I purchased these so I can listen to my iPod while riding the bus to work. I already own a pelter noise-blocking headset that I am very happy with, so I thought this headset would have the same noise blocking quality but with the added function of headphones. This headset sound is so poor that listening to music or audio is as dull as possible. My existing $10 headphones sound so much better that there is no comparison. The volume is very low when using this headset with an iPod or android phone that you will hardly be able to listen at a normal volume level even at full volume.As for the sound blocking, not as effective on the bus, instead of the expected silence, I hear the drone of the bus engine."
3,Impedance,"I have used Peltor headsets for over 15 tears and love the quality on the item. Unfortunately as others have stated the cord is too short, so I replaced it with a longer coiled cord and a 1/4"" jack.The second and more difficult issue was the headset has an impedance of 230 ohms (usually is 32 ohms), which is why they don't work on small players, cellphones or MP3 players with less power and seem to be low on volume. peltor confirmed this. Unfortunately Amazon didn't list the impedance in the ad and so I will be selling them."
1,I used to highly recommend...,"This used to be the staple food for my bettas, and i wholeheartedly recommended it to any betta keepers- the only problem is in the last year or so they've changed the recipe. The main ingredient is wheat flour, and even MSG, yes the stuff in chinese food! Shame on you Hikari. If you want the best for your fish, its best to feed a variety, and frozen food is great. As far as a prepared dry food goes, I'd say Atisons Betta food is the best thing on the market these days."
3,Not sure I notice a difference..,"I use to use wardley betta food which also came in pellets but were larger and a darker brown color. Hikari pellets are slightly smaller and are more red, so its different in content compared to wardley. I do not notice any particular difference in behavior, color, etc. when I made the switch over. My fish gobbled the other ones the same way, not sure if they have a preference since they eat flakes, pellets, bloodworms without discerning tastes. I take off stars because of the awful packaging. I don't understand why make it like that and not a tube or canister. what if you get too much? put them back into the package, as you can see, is quite difficult. they just roll out, too difficult to control. it folds up into a little stand so its upright, but i knock it over by accident and pellets fall out everywhere. there is no lid or anything. trust me, it may be clever, just not practical."
2,Zoe doesn't seem to like them,"My betta isn't a fan. She'll eventually eat them, but only after spitting them back a couple of times. Although Zoe also doesn't like bloodworms so maybe she's just picky. I'm going to go with a different brand next time. I'm sure the nutrition is fine, but I want her to like her food more!"
3,Hikari Betta Bio Gold 0.07,"They sent two of the same items. I was going to return one as it also double billed me however they said to keep the item and they would only charge for one item. However, I have not yet seen a credit on my statement, so am kinda left hanging. Not sure what to do. (shrug)"
4,Hikari Betta Bio-Gold Baby Pellets--the only food my beta will eat,"My betta loves these pellets. I haven't been able to get him to anything else, but he gobbles these up quickly."
3,Decent Food,"Decent food, but pretty expensive.Wouldn't really recommend unless you have a fussy eater. If you don't, you can buy a better food that's cheaper like Omega One. More bettas like this kind because it tastes better, but it is lower in protein, fats, etc.."
3,You can get better for the same price,You don't get a lot of food and it wont last long at all. I would recommend Aqueon pellets which are basically the same thing except you get more for around the same price. Good thing is that these pellets are slightly smaller than other pellets which is good if you have a baby betta fish.
2,Giant Deadly Insect Invasion,"If you shivered at H.G. Wells' WAR OF THE WORLDS and quaked at John Wyndham's DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS, and if you can't resist those 1950s B movies about giant ants and tarantulas and critters, then you'll love THE FURIES."
5,One of the best comedy duo's ever!,"Hoody~Hoo! Im a new listener to the Mark and Brian radio Program, and not a day goes by where I don't tune in and listen in the morrning. On my way home from school, i remembered that the CD came out today. So I decided to stop and buy it. Knowing that most comedy CD's you listen to once, then you loose it in the back of your CD case never to be heard of again. But this one ladies and Gents, is a definate keeper. On my way home from purchasing ""Little Drummer Boys"" I first popped in the Comedy CD. I couldn't believe how funny this thing was! Elfis will go down in history as one of the greatest comedic moments of all time! After listening to disk number two a few times, i popped in the music CD. The songs on that are wonderful, sung and performed by many great performers. I truly cant wait for the next CD my boys! Cudos to you both if your reading this. I'll be listening! 5 stars our of 5!"
3,did we read the same book?,"While I enjoyed this book, as well as others by this author,I am confused. The description and most reviewers talk about Nicola and her story-but she was nowhere to be found on my kindle copy. The description also talks about Marc-but he is Matt on my kindle. A good book- but not exactly as described."
5,What she wants - Cathy Kelly,"Yet another great read by this author, she never fails to deliver a really enjoyable read you want to keep reading yet you dont want to get to the end. Thank you."
5,What she wants,This is the first book of Cathy Kelly's I read a while back. I have read every word that I can find she has written since then. I just love her work. Believable people in believable plots. A great way to spend some time away. Hope she continues to write her books for a long long time.
3,What She Wants,"Story was okay, but the setup for an ebook was the worst I've seen so far. The font kept changing to different sizes, and 90% of the time the font was was too large, I could not adjust the font size. Many misspellings of words, very disappointed."
5,A pleasure to read...,Cathy Kelly's book's are always a pleasure to read. You can relate to the characters and their situations and can't wait to see how it all plays out.
3,"sony's DVDs ""created for film"" concerts","had it not been for sony's ""created for film"" DVD this could have been a five star rateing. however, because of the ""created for film"" three stars may be over rateing the DVD. i would as soon have it on a CD. Have i made my point that i do not like sony's ""created for film"" ?"
1,Just imagine...,"...a truck driver at the wheel of an F1. H. von Karajan should never have been allowed to conduct anything except from Berlioz or Wagner, where he was perfectly suited. Before I knew that, what I first got from him (Beethoven's 3rd and Dvorak's 9th) ended in garbage-bin."
3,Not impressed with the design,"My sister bought this one for me and I should have made her get her money back. If I knew she spent this much I would have insisted! I hate plastic hose carts of any type. Plastic may not rust but it does not hold up well in heavy use. The hose that hooks to the faucet is cheap and kinks up. The wheels are pneumatic, they dont hold air sometimes and worse, the axles are way too close together which makes it unstable to roll on uneven ground. The big tray is nice, I would want that on any hose reel, but on the bottom with the reel on top. The tray is helpfull for holding sprinklers and nozzles and gardening gear. This one could be used for potting plants since it is easy to clean, the tray has lots of holes to drain water. Since the hose is under the tray you have to bend down further to crank it and it is harder to handle the hose because the reel is so enclosed by the unit."
1,HORRIBLE,"I bought one of these carts from Costco in early summer 2005. By early summer 2007, I was shopping for a replacement because the Suncast model was no longer useful. I was using it to hold 200' of hose, so you'd think it would hold up. It didn't. The core of the thing may be metal, but the hinges that keep it elevated are plastic. Once those go, all you're left with is a cart.Don't buy this."
2,Missing parts,"When my hose reel arrived, it was missing 50% of the parts. Suncast was very nice and sent them to me no charge. The reel works fine. For what you pay the hose guide should move by it self. And I wish the tires would lock.And they keep going flat. Not sure I would pay that much again."
2,Nice Looking.,It is not very easy to role the hose up...it needs something that you could put your foot on to hold it as you reel the hose. We are going to give it to my daughter as she has a smaller yard and does not need to use a large part of the hose on an almost daily basis as my household.
1,Do Not Order This Hose Cart,Do not order this hose cart. The tires on it will not stay inflated resulting in the need to struggle to move it around on very difficult to roll flat tires that will not stay on their rims. In addition one of the four tires on the cart I received does not match the other three.
4,"No Koganian Virtuoso, but a decent presentation",The interpretation is an honest one. Intonation is good. Sounds are not unpleasant like some modern prodigies in their recordings. Overall it is a decent presentation of extremely difficult and hard to please violin solo peices
3,"interesting, but...","...as far as a good read goes, not great. Characters are not interesting, the ending does not work, the storyline is b-movie material."
2,Underdeveloped characters - boring.,I thought there was very poor character development - hard to identify with any of them. I struggeled to finish this book. I kept hoping something would happen in the story to make me feel better about the time I invested. The only good thing about it was the learning a bit more about the cultural issues in China.
1,Save your money!,"I hate to say that I feel this video was a complete waste of my money--the poor quality of the photography and editing, not to mention the almost unintelligible narration in Spanish, just make it a waste of time to watch. As a Spanish teacher I have seen many videos about Spain and I have to say that this is, by far, the WORST I've ever watched!"
1,They should rename this craptastic christmas,"What is with all these mainstream garbage bands, on a x-mas album, are they trying to be bad. I mean you can only have so many crappy bands on one disc. This is too many. Backside boys are they even popular anymore and out of sync ewe. this album smells so rotten, rotting egg nog.pwned."
5,The Best CD?,"YES!!! This is the best CD to have for the holidays. I listen to it in the car while Christmas shopping and everything. The CD itself is great looking, a great looking platinum snowflake. I have owned it in the past and just ordered another. NEVER keep it out of the original cover. Its worth guarding. It is a MUST BUY!!!"
2,Platinum?...Not In A Perfect World...,"Platinum Christmas is the most terrible holiday album I have ever purchased. You would think with big names like Santana, Joe, Britney, Christina, *NSYNC, and BSB, you would be in store for a great album that would last for many years as a holiday favorite? No way. This CD features dynamite artists doing their worst performances ever. Britney Spears does a good track, Christina Aguilera's track is fair, and everything is pretty much downhill from there. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the album."
3,DAVE MATTHEWS BAND IS THE ONLY REASON I BOUGHT THIS!,"If I were going to describe this album, I would call it a ""turd"". The only way it got 3 stars from me is because of the exceptional version of ""The Christmas Song"" by Dave Matthews Band. Everything else is just a combination of the pop crap that rules shows like TRL. If I were you, just download Dave's song off Napster or something. Peace."
3,Forgettable Pop Junk... but Dido saves it.,"Dave Mathews and Dido are the only things this collection of lowest common denominator songs has going for it. None of the songs are really horrible... just boring except Dido's Christmas Day. I just listened to a friends copy, and thankfully it kept me from buying it. I went instead with Christmas Songs: A Nettwerk Christmas (a far superior compilation that also includes Dido's Christmas Day)"
2,only 2 songs on the whole thing I remotely like.,"I ordered it for a Carlos Santana song I couldn't get anywhere else. Basically, not one I'd recommend to anyone I know."
3,Some good tracks,"The best tracks in my opinion were from Dido, Spears, Houston, and Braxton. For Spears fans and non-fans: her track is one of the best. Excellent: in the same tradition of Dolly Parton and that other female singer who did ""Jingle Bell Rocks"". With that sound plus some of Spears experienced vocal techniques from her first CD. I think Christina fans will like her addition but I felt it was lacking and agree that what was missing in her song can be found on Braxton's song. Whitney Houston proves again that she has some of the most experienced vocal talent and technique (well deserved for being awarded a life time achievement award). Other good additons were by Joe, Jars of Clay, and a catchy song by TLC (of No Scrubs fame). Santana's addition was nice. I admit I was disappointed with N'Sync, BSB, and Christina'a: not as good as I'm used to."
5,"A great pick for beginners, experts, and everyone in between!","I borrowed Katrina Fitness Ease Into Pilates DVD from my local library, and I LOVED it! It had been a while since I had done Pilates, but this was the perfect segue for more for me. Katrina has a very soothing voice, and her instructions are very detailed. The video was quick, and you can complete all 5 segments in a little over half and hour, or if you want to pick one segment for a quick go, you can do that too. I'm looking on here to see if I can make it a permanent part of my exercise DVD library!"
3,Perk it up,"Nice item, a bit pricey. Especially when it was sent in aplastic bag torn open before I received it."
5,I LOVE it,"This is my sons FAVORITE blanket/ toy. I have twins, 9 month old B/G and this is deffinatly Jamies favorite. I love this toy because its safe to keep in the crib, and I dont worry about my son chocking or sufficating from this puppy. It can be used as a blanket for a short while, but he really is a great snuggle toy. He goes great with the my First Puppy Blue, because they look so simillar and my son loves em' both, but the My First Puppy is easier to take around with us. This blanket (blue, how original?) has been thrown up on, sneezed on, drooled on, bitten, cryed on, ""made"" on, and dragged all over riverhead and he always comes out just as plush as he has always looked, I actually only have one ""blue"" but about 4-5 babies first puppies!! Blue is soo safe and is absoulutly my sons favorite ""security blanket"". I loved Blue so much that I bought the pink elephant for my daughter too, the dolls and puppies are no longer the favorites for the twins, the animal blankets are!!!"
2,"music 4, sound quality 1 (at best!)","we all know bird was one of the best.but...the SQ of these recordings is revolting. constant hiss on 90% of the tracks makes headphone listening imposible(only on ""just friends is it realy clear). were the masters destroyed?, these songs sound like they were taped off the radio!listen in store if possible...than get something else (by parker, of course:-)"
2,"Great music, horrible sound","This disc has the worst sound quality of any that I have listened to, including blues recordings from the 20s, 10th generation Grateful Dead bootlegs, etc. The music is *almost* lost in what sound like easy-to-filter-out hisses, pops, and crackles. It sounds like there were no efforts at remastering; indeed, it sounds as though someone were playing an old single into a microphone to produce the CD.Do the rest of the Ken Burns discs sound this bad? (I will never know first-hand.)"
1,"good godfrey, clean this up!","I don't know much about how they remaster and transfer music to CD's, but it sounds as if the originals were used to sweep up the studio floor and then transferred to CD. Horrible, horrible quality made me eject this CD four songs in, I just can't listen to it, so now it sits on my shelf collecting dust. It's a great collection from a true genious, but Ken Burns should be ashamed to put his name on this disc sounding the way it does. I've heard hisses and pops, but my old records sound way better than this :-("
2,He is OK,"I do not like Parker's style at all. I can't really say anything else. It is all in the way you format a song, and I just don't like parker."
3,"Great Music, Terrible Quality","Being a huge Charlie Parker fan, I was excited to find a CD with such a diverse cross-section of his excellent work. Although it is very difficult to distill Parker's music to fit onto a single CD, Ken Burns managed to capture the essence of his music better than any of the other ""greatest hits"" that I have heard. Unfortunately, the sound quality is dismal. If you want something to listen to in your car, this would be a worthwhile purchase. If you are going to be listening on a decent sound system, I'd recommend something with better remastering ( like ""the Essential Charlie Parker."" )"
4,Best tool for relaxing and meditating ever!,"Unfortunately while I was at the office these were amazing, but when I took them to my home, the cable is too short - way, way, way too short."
3,Good but not as good as could be,"it's OK, but it doesn't take full advantage of your surround sound equipment. Don't get me wrong, Willie does a nice job and if you're a Willie Nelson fan, you'll probably like it.Also, some of the songs are cut short, which I personally don't care for. If you compare the production and Surround quality to the John Fogerty DVD.....you'll get my drift...Now that's a DVD!"
2,Sooo sorry. I like Bette Davis & Erroll Flynn &,"Elizabethan period pieces. Most of all I love all those great movies from 1939. However, I could not stand this boring mellow-drama. It went on & on. I really feel bad about this when I see how much everybody else liked it."
3,Geared towards children but a informative for all ages,"The ""Headliners"" series was geared towards children ranging from the early elementary to the ""tween"" years, but this particular work contains information pertinent to all ages.Recounting the tumultuous 1992 election through charts, photographs, and simple text, this work shows readers exactly why the election that year was followed so intently by all Americans. A sentence like ""Delegates make a lot of noise and wear funny hats"" is a good example of how this book is geared towards youngsters, but I have no doubt that parents who purchase this book for their children will find themselves equally interested in the retelling of the recent election."
3,Naval Ship History,A nifty little catlog of naval ships spanning about 140 years of naval warfare.Each page is a short history and stat's on a given ship or a class of ships.For first timers wanting alot of information at once it is a great book.
5,Fantastic book for the size and price,"Fantastic directory! I have many naval books (about 200) and this is the first one that covers 141 years and I can take with me where ever I go! Imagine doing this with Conway's All the Worlds Fighting Ships (this is a 4 book series covering the same period, and big books at that).It doesn't cover every ship of the period but for its size and price its superb! As for the missing classes Mr. Corwin notes, I agree but its O.K., except for one, the Talwar class entered service in 2003, the book was published in 2001. In mine oppinion there is only one serious mistake: the Hydra class where battleships not cruisers, I know I am Greek!"
5,English in America,"Another gourmet winner for Delia!Here is the second in a series of three cook books where you can't go wrong, and you do not have to slave over a hot stove all day to present a wonderful meal.Informative: so you have background knowledge on the whys and wherefores of why you are using this, and how to do that.Standardised proceedures: ingredients are clearly listed and subdivided where necessary.Brilliantly simple recipes such as Roasted Fish with a Parmesan Crust or Oven Fried Onions - why hadn't I thought of that!Delicious standards, Salade Nicoise, Shepherds Pie - note it's made with minced lamb, hence the name. A chicken stir-fry made different by the addition of coconut.Exquisite, so simple deserts, in Eton Mess or Toffee-Fudge Bananas with Toasted Nuts. You can even present the good and the bad together in Chocolate and Prune Brownies!Whether you are inexperienced or a pro these recipes work and the bonus is they are delightfully delectable."
5,1930s Harlem Musical,"I first viewed Moon Over Harlem when I was a kid with my dad in the early 1960s. This is a great film for anyone who wants a better understanding of African American music, dress and culture of the 1920s and 1930s. The film is fast paced and has a great music score."
1,I gave it one star because NO STARS was not an option.,"After hearing many good things about this book, I decided to see for myself...Way disappointing. I couldnt get into the characters, it just felt like I was reading one long, boring newspaper article. Afterwards, I was angry that I had spent not only money on this book, but also time."
3,"Bridget, you ignorant slut","OK, I admit this book was entertaining. However, Bridget needs to learn not to give it up quite so easily! My goodness. She should be ashamed of herself. Having said that, the book is a bit of a guilty pleasure."
4,Entertaining insight into the life of a tabloid journalist,"True-life story of a British journalist who crossed the Atlantic to work for the New York Post. She ended up writing a column about her love life. One critic gushed: ""A real-life Bridget Jones meet Sex and the City."" I've never seen either of those, so I can't say. On the plus side, she includes her experiences writing and reporting for the Post on matters other than her love life, such as her interview with a man who just lost his wife during a Christmas hit-and-run accident, which made her feel ghoulish. I'd have preferred more of the latter, and less personal love life stuff. Worth a look for some insight into the inner workings of New York tabloid journalism."
1,pathetic,"I felt sorry for Bridget, because she is so pathetic. She seems to lack both brains and integrity. Don't waste your time or your money on this book!"
3,The Genius of Brando deserves Better,while this Book has some good intentions it doesn't reach the true Depth of the Genius that Marlon Brando was.the Book never fully reaches where it attempts to go.
2,Filled with Buzzwords and Acronyms,"I'm the architect working on a corporate portal for a sector of my company for close to a year. I thought this book would give me some insight on our situation and maybe some steps to take for the future. I found that the first couple chapters give a very good general overview of the e-business landscape. The later chapters are filled with every buzzword you've ever heard. There's An Acronym For Everything (TAAFE)! Small sample from pages 100-103: IPDM, PCSB, CRM, BPI, EAI, SOI, API, ERP, EDI, TCI, BCI, BAI. Some of which are covered in the five page list of abbreviations at the back of the book. I thought I was looking at stock quotes for a while. Overall, chapters 1, 2 & 7 were worth reading."
4,"A compilation, but a good one!","While this is, in fact, a compilation book, the framing elements around her stories always shed more light on the personality of Miles and the people around him. I enjoyed it tremendously."
1,A Reprinted Collection,Nothing wrong with the book if you have not previously read the three works contained in it. Its not a new novel.
3,This is NOT a new book; it's a compilation,"This is an anthology - one of the series of Vorkosigan anthologies Baen is releasing. It contains Borders of Infinity (the short story), Brothers in Arms, and Mirror Dance. Don't buy this thinking it's a new book!"
5,Miles Errant,While all of these three stories have been in print before it was nice to see them together. Lois is one of the best writers out there.
2,"Great Music, Horrid Sound","I really loved the song selection for this album. It had a nice mix of classics.Sadly, it seems they found the most horrid copies of these songs on the face of the planet to master from.Half of the songs are barely listenable the noise levels are so bad. This is quite a shame. I know better copies exist for some of these songs. Perhaps even a run through an electronic noise filter would of helped a lot with these recordings.If you are a music historian or researcher (or perhaps a recording ""purist""), this may be a good CD for you because the performances are brilliant. For the other 99.9% of the people out there, look elsewhere for recordings from one of the most legendary female vocalists of all time. You can find great performances from her that you will fine more sonically enjoyable elsewhere."
4,Billie Holiday - Jazz,Great album! The song selection gives a great introduction to those of us who are not fully familiar with the brilliance of Billie Holiday.
2,Unbelievable bad cd quality. DONT WASTE YOUR CASH,Billie Holiday is great. this cd however is not.The terrible sound quality on the first 2 tracks dissapointed me so much that it ruined this album & what it could have been to me.I'm extremley dissapointed in Ken Burns' decision for the lack of quality in this cd & wouldnt have to think twice from purchasing another cd put out by him.i hope he reads this and refunds my money.I've very disapointed.
5,PARADIGM-SHIFITING/LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE!,"I love this book so much that I have already bought 3 and still planning to buy more to give out to my friends. This book combines science and spirituality so beautifully. What he describes in this book make logical sense. I have never been a believer of ""God"" in a form of superior being. And I have never been comfortable with organized religion. This book really confirmed and went further into the world of ""consciousness."" HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
1,Junk,"Disappointing - Just alot of standard footage pasted together with loud music in the background. Like one long 30 minute commercial, half of it wasn't even about the Blue Angels."
4,Greengage Jam,I bought two jars of this and have used sparingly. It's been over a year now and I am just now ready to open the second jar. I have tasted greengage jam made by an English friend of mine and both delicious. I am glad I ordered two jars as I see this is out of stock right now and I have been on a waiting list for it to return.
5,Keeps doors where you want them.,"This door older/stop does a great job of holding doors and a decent job of stopping doors. The stopping mechanism is solid, but really slamming the door open doesn't seem painless to the door or the stop. Where this device shines is as a door holder. It confidently holds my spring assisted door even on a breezy day. This is a great tool for keeping the door open when I want it open."
4,Great solution,This is the fix I needed for a door that drifted half way shut. Also would be a great way to secure against a strong breeze.
1,Do not work as expected !,The Doctor recomended this item for my Husband who has a spur in his heel. The problem is he couldn't put his shoes on without the heel cup moving where he didn't need it.
4,"Tuli's Double-Ribbed PRO Hell Cups, Regular Size",I like the Tuli's double-ribbed PRO heel cups. I purchased a pair in regular but I really need a smaller size to fit more snugly since my heels are small. Do they make them in small? Otherwise they are okay.
3,"Great jeans for the money, but have cut back on quality","I have been wearing these jeans for several years. The first batch just wore out and I ordered several more. The fabric is lighter weight and the belt loops tear off.They are still great jeans, but the decrease in quality is aggravating. I would rather spend a couple of bucks more for the original quality."
3,OK pants but...,"One of the belt loops broke first time they were worn, not a huge issue as I'm handy with a needle and thread, just something you don't expect out of a new pair of jeans."
5,Wonderful Jeans,"I happen to be wearing a pair of these jeans today. They are the most comfortable jeans I have ever had. I ride a Harley and they give me the relaxed fit that you need on a bike.Thanks, Joe"
5,Outstanding Value,"Having saved $100 over pricing anywhere else, I was very excited when I was able to buy this NWT combo here on Amazon at this exceptionally low price. Both products work perfectly at antisipated high quality Suunto standards...very pleased."
2,"Might be just the thing, might not.","This fuse block tap (it fits into a cavity in a fuse block, it is not a ""cavity"") is exactly the right thing and solves the tap problem in the right manner. Or it would have been the right thing if it were possible to identify which of many variations on the tap body shape one is buying. In fact I bought three of them having this part number, and two were one shape, and one was another, and none actually fit the opening in the fuse block. In short, there is no organized way of identifying exactly what is the right part, and apparently whoever it was who packaged these didn't even know there were different kinds. With an accurate means of choosing the right part, and accurate packaging, this would be a golden find for anyone who really needs it."
4,A.Quincy Jones,"It is easy to dismiss the work of Quincy Jones (1913-79) as modernism lite. His long association with Joseph Eichler and other suburban builders prevented him from being taken as seriously as more rigorous and rebellious peers. Modern architecture is supposed to be challenging; Jones made it look easy. However, a drive around Crestwood Hills in West LA, and a close examination of the model houses he and others designed for that enlightened housing association, engender a new respect. Pragmatic, inventive, and humane, Jones bridged the chasm between high art and popular taste, emphasizing practicality over ideology. Buckner has hands-on experience, having restored four Jones houses, and one wishes she had expanded her brief introduction to the architect's career to communicate her personal enthusiasm for his unshowy brilliance. In every other way, this is an admirable survey of 65 key projects, illustrated with vintage black and white photos, drawings and plans."
5,A. Quincy Jones Architecture,great product and great service.very helpful information for our home owners associationalso a good historical perspective on mid century modern homes
2,Atomic Ranch House story bombed,Living in an Atomic Ranch designed by A. Quincy Jones I wanted to learn more about this man and his design style. While this book has a lot of wonderful pictures of many of his houses it did not tell much about the man and his design style. I will leave the book for the next owner of the house.
1,Conversation with the Devil,Will Shad's book had me hooked in the beginning and then I had to stop reading. His reflections on God's plan for the world started to take an evil facist twist towards women being less smart than men and Aids being created by God because he thinks homosexuals should be exterminated. His word play(a direct imitation of Walsh's books)were so annoying after a while that any depth was lost. What a ripoff of Neale Donald Walsch's books. This book should be taken off your list that even associates with Walsh's books. Its the first book I have ever burned.
1,Will Shad is out of control,"I recently read this book, and was AMAZED at what this kook get's away with. It's painfully obvious that Will was dumped by a girl as he absolutely berates the female gender. This book is nothing more that an attempt at ""getting back"" at women for all they've done to him.I want my money back."
4,Good but,"I love Sister, Sister and I love Lisa she is so funny. The thing that brothers me the most is that they cut some stuff from some of the episodes. Like in Operation Deja Vu they cut off at least a minutes worth. I can tell because I had it on tape. Without that stuff it really does not make sense. Everything else is great. I just hope season 3 comes out before 2010.Oh by the way I can not believe that I have been writing reviews for a whole year. I hope to last longer."
4,3.5/5 Stars,"This is a fairly good album. There are no songs on the disc that I dislike. However, on a whole, There Will Be Blood Tonight is more exciting, and thus Gifted Program pales by comparison."
1,Virtual Training does not work right,I have used cisco routers for years.This simulator does not behave like a cisco router.The simulator look like it was written using Macromedia products and does not even have appropriate context sensitive help.Stear clear.
4,memories....,"man, I remember having a sega saturn back in 2000, after finding it at a yard sale. it came with one three games, virtua fighter, bug! and three dirty dwarves. I had fun playing three dirty dwarves the most because of it's gameplay. the only reason why I'm giving it four stars is that the game can be beaten before an hour. but overall, I'm glad that it's also a pc game. can't wait to ask my mom to get it for me."
4,wonderful tales from She Ate My Bait,"I have been reading about the Monterey Bay all my life, and i wanted to read stories that reflected some of the local life around the Monterey area. This book exceeded my expectations, delighted my senses & stirred my soul to dream of the foggy nights on the beach watching the hobo fire. Amanda Wong"
5,the platinum collection,"This is a great compliation! I bought this over two years ago, and I still listen to it all the time. I highly recommend it.:)"
3,"Some good songs, and some not so good","Not a bad cd, at least after the first 3 tracks are done with. Those I am not crazy about. But the Toni Braxton, Az Yet, Tony Rich and Whitney Houston songs more than compensate. The remaining songs and artists are ok, ""Waterfalls"" is a good song. Usher's ""Nice and Slow"" would be a lot better without that annoying 'female' voice in the background, asking what he wants to do to her. Actually, it doesn't really sound very female...more like a guy putting on a female voice than anything. This album is good to have on random with other dance/r&b albums for when you are having a party."
1,Moosewood MINI edition,"This book is so tiny the pages are so small that its difficult to read the print. I never would have bothered with this purchase if I knew it measures 2"" X 3""."
2,Mini edition? try micro...,"This book is not just ""mini"" but really really tiny. it will easily fit into your jeans pocket."
2,Mini-Moosewood very mini,"Had no idea this was really a tiny book -- and the list price was what I paid, so there was no savings. Either I read the description wrong or it was misleading - not sure which. But the service was good and delivery was prompt. My problem was with the book, not the sender."
5,Good value,"I bought this from a major online vendor for a very looooow price.When mixed 4:1, this product is extremely cheap to use.Cleans my MPV, Impreza and G35 wheels really well, since I clean my wheels soo often, I am thinking of mixing wheel brightener 10:1. This would further increase the value of this product.I would suggest users exercise caution as this is an acid based product, I usually clean ONE wheel at a time. Spray on for 45 seconds and hose off immediately.I also recommend users USE eye protection and a mask as you do NOT want to breath in this stuff.For the price of a gallon, this stuff cannot be beat."
5,Easily The Next Literary Star!,"I was so impressed by the way this book is put together. It's a quick read, but full of substance and style. His beginning is sensual with a flavor that outclasses some of the so-called ""best"" of the day. The character development, the use of language, outstanding!Marvin Reid is easily one of the very best writers of the day; I'm anxious to see what his second work will be like.Spectacular!"
3,all things are possible,i brought this book after reading one of the authors other book(steven)and this may have been his first but i wasnt all that impressed with this one i was reading to find out what the secret was and it was revealed early so i was a little disappointed but if you are looking for a book to help you to believe that anything is possible this is it
5,Marvin Marvin Marvin!!!,"The author himself actually handed me a bookmark on the Metro and the first thing I remembered was his handsome face, then I went to work, checked out and purchased his book. All I can say is that he's as good, if not better than those who are touted as the best. I say that because the story he writes is one that uplifts a woman and shows her man to be a helpmate, a REAL man. While there's drama, it's really just a backdrop to an interesting story. The first thirty or so had me squirming and I had to excuse myself from the room I was in so I could calm down. He's certainly an excellent writer and shows his intelligence by not using the main character's circumstance for some perverse pleasure. I've recommended it to everyone."
4,Satisfied Customer,"The product was easy to set up. Works well, and thus far has had no problems. The main attached device is a Linksys PoE WAP and the PoE seems to be working very well using this Netgear switch."
5,Wonderful fresh scent,Love the fragrance! It's light and fresh. The soap cleans well and rinses easily. Refill pack is a great value.
1,Huge Disappointment,"I spent a whole year preparing for a summer in PAris with my daughter. I wanted our summer to be perfect, so I bought absolutely every book on the subject. Some were great, some not so much; but this one was by far the worst guide I bought! It says absolutely nothing!! It is 149 pages long, but in reality one could compress the contents into about 40 or 50 pages (the rest are non-informative pictures and blank spaces...).I really regret having paid almost twenty dollars for a book that wasn't helpful at all and which I didn't even bother taking along. Yes, it was THAT bad."
4,Alfetta 159 Historical Overview,"A true Alfa Romeo affectionado I have 2 GTV6's. While in name only, they share many Alfetta 159 features.This book shares the history of the cars and men that designed, built and raced them. A gem that should be required reading of any Alfa fan.Not many auto makers can claim such a heritage."
2,Pour sound,"Great artist and the selection of songs is good, but the quality of recording is very bad. Choose something else from this artist"
5,"Great songs, bad sound","It is the music that deserves the 5 stars here, which is what I am rating it. But the sound quality on some of the tracks is terrible. And seeing as the same problem exists on a lot of the Ken Burns series, while the same songs on other cd releases have been fine in the sound quality, I have come up with the only answer possible. That those songs have been transferred straight from the original 78 rpm records. It certainly sounds that way, but I don't understand why they should do that. Surely these great jazz artists deserve the best sound possible for their masterpieces. But, all that aside, this is still a good collection to have, especially for someone unfamiliar with Hawkins, as it covers most of his career and different record labels. The booklet contains a couple of photos and an interesting essay on Hawkins. If only the sound were better!"
3,Bad quality on some tracks,"Unfortunately 5 tracks have terrible quality, you hear a loud sizzling on these tracks. You would have thought that for this special projection they could have come up with cleaner tracks. How can a producer permitted those tracks to have been printed? The noise takes away from the enjoyment of those tracks. The rest of the tracks are great and you can enjoy the beautiful playing of Hawkins. I have the Blakey, Bechet, Davis and the best of and have not experienced the same problem."
5,I just love it!,"I got Wakko's wish from a while and Ive just watchet it a billion time! I love that story so differnt from a normal cartoon show and that's because some people shouldn't like it, but Wakko's wish is different cause it showh a hide side of the Warner that I love I love that the sibs aren't just a crazy trio of little nuts but they can also show the love that wthey feel each others All the cast of voice actor is great, first Rob Paulsen and Tress MacNeille I think they gave the best! I can't don't love all the songs! They're just great! Especially the one where they sing about their own wish! Thanks Randy Rogel! And thanks Tom Ruegger to made a such wonderful story! Now we just need more Animaniacs show!"
4,Wakko's Wish,This movie is not what I expected. The content is a little advanced for 4-5 year olds. But the characters are really cute.
2,Eh.,"I'm a huge Animaniacs fan, and I'm surprised that so many people are giving this full-length movie positive reviews. It's ok, but it's not nearly as sharp as the cartoon. Granted, I'm an adult, and it is definitely a kids movie, but that was always the case with the 'toon, as well. The jokes just aren't as funny, and the songs are nothing like the 3 CDs full of Animaniacs songs I own. They're boring and repetitive. I bought this video, watched it once, and gave it to a friend with kids. The VCR ate the tape as soon as they got it, and I didn't even feel bad."
3,Expected this to be funnier,"Was good, but expected more.... worth watching, but not one of my favorite roasts. Did not like the format of this one either. Liked the old format with all the chairs to the side so you could see ALL the stars reactions to the jokes."
1,Really not great.,"I had high expectations for this one, being a fan of The Domestic Goddess. Sadly, this was a big disappointment. It felt as if most of the Roasters were ill-prepared and not one of them was laughable. It felt uncomfortable at times and seemed as if the guests were called last minute to fill a spot deserted by someone else."
3,Stories and Legends,"Carcassonne was the favorite stop in my visit to France and Spain and I ordered this book with the thought of getting more info/history. It was not quite what I had expected, being mostly a travelogue of another tourist albeit in the 1930's. Nevertheless, there were some interesting stories about many of the places I visited. I just had hoped for something more recent or historical."
3,Corningware Baking Dishes Bake and Serve,It was okay but I was not satisfied and one of the dishes were broken. I thought the Baking Dishes were larger.I would not recommend it for anyone baking and having guests. The dishes are too small.
3,It is heavy and smaller than it actually looks in the picture,"CorningWare French White 12-Piece Pop-Ins Bake and Serve SetOk product. If you like lighter Bakeware set, then don't go for it. If you don't care for the weight, then it is reasonable. Also, the original piece is a little smaller than the one you see in the picture on the website. Be carefull."
3,Argh!,"The dang lids don't fit! Not only do they rattle like all get out when I carry them from one place to another, but when they're in the fridge at eye level, I can peek right in at my food thanks to the fairly large gaps between the dish and the lid. Otherwise perfectly nice, but seeing as how both the lids and the dishes are made by the same company you'd like they could coordinate to make the pieces fit together."
3,good item but not really on sale at amazon,I bought this item when it was on sale at amazon but when i received the items i realised that they are manufacturing defective items. lids do not fit exactly on the bows and bowl has some black small dust like spot in it.I am sure we can find better deal at LNT or rossas a item this are real good.
1,POOR PACKAGING,I placed two separate orders for this product and each order was received with one broken dish. The set s not packaged correctly by the manufacture. Ended by buying a different produce else where.
4,useful,Someone told me its in the Talmud that food left uncovered for twenty minutes must be thrown away because of the BELIEF that there are invisibly tiny insects in the air that will poison the food (BACTERIA!)The heavy glass lids are reportedly a rarity nowadays and other bake and serve sets are offering ceramic lids. These lids are heavier and thicker than my corning casserole from the 1970s. I ordered them because I need them for company dinner but I don't actively like them.I've already found them useful so I should appreciate them. I usually need two per meal.I'm ordering a second set because the replacement lids cost as much as a new set and I want back up because these pieces are working out very well and the price is good.
1,BROKEN PIECES,"I was VERY dissatisfied when I receive this product in the mail. It's a 12-piece set and 3 of the dishes were broken upon arrival. I'm sorry, but if you cannot package a breakable set well enough to ship, then DON'T offer it for sale as an online product.Second Attempt:Amazon was great in sending a replacement set, but I STILL received a broken piece. Same issue applies - if you cannot package it well enough to ship, then don't do it. This is SO frustrating, because it's wasting everyone's time and money. Just do the job right the first time!"
4,Product still gets 5 stars!,"I also received my set with a broken piece, but Amazon was more than gracious in replacing it with no cost to me. There is definitely a packaging problem, but I cannot say the same for the actual product. The Corningware is multi-functional and in french white, very stylish. This stuff lasts forever and takes quite a bit of abuse!"
3,good value,"very good value on this item, however, the large casserole was broken and they could not replace the set because there were ""issues"" with the product. Sounded like others were having difficulty with broken items. I chose not to send it back for a refund because I could use all the other pieces. Customer Service was excellent, trying to help me."
3,Lids don't fit well,"The baking pieces themselves are good, but the glass covers are loose with gaps all around. They rattle and tend to fall off easily. Definitely not the same quality Corningware my mother used to have."
4,Doctor's advice,"St. Augustine's position as a Doctor of the Church is understandable, even after only reading parts of this terrific book! He really comes at a discussion of the Trinity in a logical fashion that appeals to hearts and experiences, not just minds!I'd definitely recommend it to anyone of a particularly cerebral bent looking to learn more about their faith from a Doctor of the Church! This isn't light bedside reading, and it won't seem as simple as, say, the wisdom shared by Therese of Lisieux. But for those looking to read and learn about the Trinity, this book offers a deep and rich look at a mystery of the faith that many of us today take for granted, from a time when many people didn't take it for granted!"
5,A classic treatise by a key patristic source,"Along with ""The Confessions"" and ""The City of God,"" St Augustine's work on the Trinity is one of his important works, covering his major concerns in the middle portion of his career. In addition the translation is reliable throughout. I keep it on my kindle for constant reference and notations."
5,Great english translation,"It may be that had I waited to complete this book before reviewing it, I would never get around to it. It is a rich theological work, with some profound insights that have shaped all of Western Christianity.The introductory commentary is incredibly helpful. I find that certain sections of the book shine above others, and I probably cannot read it from front to back. It does have a lot of gems, and it is easy to find them.For fans of Augustine, for students of theology, and any other serious thinker interested in the Christian tradition, I highly recommend."
4,A different kind of reference,"Olsen writes two or three paragraphs of factual, but sometimes slightly opinionated biography on each woman. There are photos or illustrations on most pages, but unfortunately not for every woman. Along with ""the usuals"" (Abigail Adams, Jane Addams, Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Earhart, Babe Didrickson Zaharias, etc.) are some very unusuals (Amina, Boudica, Juana Inez de la Cruz, Sarojini Naidu, Hanna Reitsch, Al-Khansa, etc.). The index of women's names makes it easy to use as a reference, but it would be even better if an index by country and time period was added. Since I am reviewing the hardcover, maybe it has been added."
2,"Sorry, no theory, just a catalogue.","The introductory chapters promise a methodological approach on intructional design. Forget it. There are hardly any research findings in the book, and of those, none come from the author. The book keeps repeating itself by saying that we deal with all kinds of instructions on a daily basis, up to the point where you start skipping the text. In the end, all that's left is the catalogue of an exhibit of instructional design examples. There's even a hint that this is what the book was made out of..."
3,How To Do It...Including Pictures!,"No, you perverts, not that...this book tells you everything you always wanted to know about instructional design. You know, those little picture stories that tell you how to thread a bobbin, put on a life vest, open a can of sardines, or change the battery in your camera.The book itself is not well put together -- it could have included more information about where the informational comics came from -- but the cartoons are a hoot! Ingenious, some of them, totally incomprehensible some others.Look at this book - you will learn something, but look at it at the library. Have some fun looking at the directional comics from other countries. Just don't buy it...I don't think it is worth the money."
3,design ideas,"a student of industrial design and looking for information on UI and instructions, this book is great in that it shows a variety of examples of instructions that are good/bad. very colorful and interesting pictures, not alot of specific information though; alot of good quotes and perspectives on instruction information."
4,A visual feast,Really nice book with beautiful images! If you don't know how to open a can or what to do in a plane crash - buy this book!
1,"Oh God, help us...","This is the most annoying toy I have ever experienced on G-d's green earth. It seems as if it were made as a gag gift to irritate parents. My son loves phones, but even he leaves this one (with its horrendous soundtrack) alone. Sometimes you just have to wonder about the people that make decisions over there... don't they do focus groups and stuff? SAVE YOURSELVES. Ours is going to Goodwill immediately, and I even feel a little guilty about that..."
1,Purple Turned Out Pink,"We are first-time dyers, but I expected this to turn out a much deeper purple than the medium pink that came out. Even after two dyes (and using the entire container) on a single white scarf, we were unsuccessful. The goal was to make the scarf Ravens purple not an odd pinkish color my husband won't wear."
5,I'm stunned,"In the dreary era of Wynton Marsallis and all of thoseuntalented, politically correct (...), thus CD is unbelievable! It's physically amazing, intelligent, hip...this has to be just about the best piano player in the world...Period! Even Keith Jarrett seems tired lately, and don't even mention hacks like Kenny Barron! This is like one of those dreams you have about hearing an imaginary, perfect concert...it's fun and accessabile and I don't know why this guy is not world famous. It's got a blues tinge to it so it's not too European...it also puts to shame all those Herbie/McCoy/Bill Evans (...) that infest the NPR white collar Muzak stations.I'd recommend this to anyone."
2,A beginner's guide for sure,"Very short and one of the better beginner's guides to Tolkien around, though that doesn't make it very good. It's written in such an elementary and stiff manner that one wonders if the beginner of the title is the author. The organization is good, and the plot summaries are not over-detailed. But though the prose is competent, it's horribly dull, and slides clumsily over Tolkien's themes. A full chapter details arguments against Tolkien without allowing a real defense of his principles. Bullet-point summaries, and definitions of a few tough words (like ""philology"" and ""feudalism"") are provided."
4,Good Oil For Small Engines,"This is a good quality oil for small engines like push mowers and single cylinder engines. I bought this case of oil to service my lawn equipment. Was cheaper then what the local store had. I do not recommend this thick of an oil (30HD) in motorcycles, car or truck engines unless the manufacturer says its ok. When this case runs out I would consider purchasing another from the same vendor."
3,"Good, but to repetitive","""DJ Culture"" is a great CD the first time you listen to it, by the second listen you find yourself a little tired of it, and by the third time around you'll be skipping to only the tracks you like. This is not a CD you can listen all the way through, take it from me, I've heard much better efforts from Blank & Jones. ""Nightfly"" ""La Luna"" & ""Cream"" are great progressive trance tracks, but the rest sound too much alike. Sorry guys, I have to say I really hated giving this album 3 stars but like I said in my review for Kardinal Offishall, maybe next time..."
5,A secuence for the mind flow............,"Excellent, didactic work on a connecting way to practice YOGA a balance of timing and holding ASANAS to create a state of mind !!!"
5,Very please :-),"I was very pleased with the filter and the customer service from the seller. The filter arrived before it was scheduled, and I was very happy!"
5,Easy to use.,Once you get the hang of it you will love it. Take your time using it. Don't forget to loosen the screw a bit after it expands. A slow drip it's right enough. Little bit of trial and error at first. Great price I love it
3,Perfect for diner cups,"If you just want a small cup of joe in the morning, then this is perfect. It's easy to use but can be a pain if you screw the filter in to hard, and now you have to unscrew it while it's hot. My suggestion is to practice with it a few timesbefore making coffee. Otherwise it is quite good at what it does, and also very cheap."
4,Good Stainless Steel coffe item,I had never had veitnamese style coffee before purchasing this item. It was wonderful the item works great clean easy and was shipped fast. Would recommend to friends and other coffee lovers.
2,Doesnt work that well,"I bought a better one at the local Asian market for half the price and it works better.This one has too large holes on the bottom, the screw doesnt work that well, and it doesnt hold as much coffee."
3,Missing a big piece,"The only thing I see missing is a little screw-top-like thing for the filter. Once I add the hot water in, I am unable to turn the filter to make it lose. I have to use my fingers and it burns... ;\ Then again, I think that was a big issue for me so I hardly use this filter set..."
3,Ouch!,"It makes great coffee, but using this filter can burn you.The directions tell you to pour hot water in the top, then reach in with your fingers and unscrew the (now) boiling hot metal plate. Other models have a slot so you can use a screwdriver. The best don't use screws at all. Try finding one of them before you buy this one."
