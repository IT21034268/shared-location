3,Disappointing,"After reading a few reviews I expected more from this book. Embrionary plot and superficial contents make it only an average SF book. Entertaining, but nothing more."
2,"Three stars entertainment, one star story","If you believe in god, transcendence or merely that something happens after you pop out of existence... still won't find in this book much enlightment. Furthermore, if you are one of the non-believers, or even just an agnostic, then this electric souls thing will definitely not be a WOW! type of an idea.Still, the book entertains. Too bad I didn't like the concept."
2,nothing special,"I got bored with this book to the point that Istarted skimming through it. However, Robert Sawyer'sbook 'The End Of An Era' was great and I couldnt putit down.Avid Science Fiction Reader"
1,Ugh.,"Ten reasons to avoid this book:1) Clumsy, insipid prose.2) Rubber science.3) The world's most obvious murder mystery.4) A whiny and dull protagonist. You'd want to smack him if you only gave a damn what happened to him.5) Rob's Remedial Plotting 101: ""Hmm. My opening is rather slow. I know! I'll take a random scene from the end of the book and tack it to the beginning. Yeah! Then three hundred pages of flashback. That oughta juice 'er up.""6) Simplistic plotting. The author has either not properly thought through all of the consequences, or is deliberately avoiding difficult issues.7) Even more simplistic solutions...8) ...which lead to sophmoric philosophy...9) ...which leads to laughable ""transcendent"" ending.10) Man. Must've have been a slow year at the Nebula awards."
2,A terrible disappointment.,"I have a habit of purchasing SF books that won the Nebula or Hugo award, and so far I have been pretty pleased with the selection except when it came to this one. It must be a slow year for awards. This book is poorly written, no characterizations, no plots, no reasons for being. If I had bought the book from a local store that accepts return, it would have been back on their shelf after a couple of chapters"
1,Garbage,"Came to my house already smelling of burnt electronics. I hooked it up knowing that something unfortunate would probably occur. And, alas, it died almost within seconds sending plume of smoke into the cab of my truck. Don't buy pyle, nothing but problems from what i've read. I went with a walmart amp and bought the 6.99 replacement for a year for half the price. Can't beat that and my system still bumps."
3,IT'S GREEK TO ME...,"This reference book is a handy guide to more than fifteen thousand foreign terms. One occasionally comes across such when reading, but it may be a term with which the reader may be unfamiliar. These terms, drawn from various disciplines, are found in this one handy little tome along with their meanings which are clear and concise. With this source, one may avoid having to sort through a variety of reference materials in order to come up with the needed meaning or definition."
5,foreign terms,"This book is a must for anyone who reads Maureen Dowd, etc. It is a fantastic reference book."
5,Unknown classic for the darwave crowd,"I'm listening to this CD for the first time, and it's blowing my mind.New Order, meets Cocteau Twins, meets The Smiths... beautiful, just beautiful"
3,Bowls,Not like the old fashioned ones that I still have. They do not seem to be as sturdy. I would recommend them to someone who does not have an older set to compare them to.
2,Poorly fitting lids,"Convenient size but the lids don't really fit without a struggle. In addition, the plastic material is relatively thin. When hot it becomes very flexible and poses a risk of spilling the contents when removing from microwave. Be careful !"
3,This is a mildly interesting book.,"It might prove to be interesting to someone who has lived in Alaska, but for those of us who have only visited there once it was a little tedious.I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for a humorous reading experience. There were a few smiles, but that's all."
3,Informative but with one caveat,"This book contains updated information on the disposition and fates of many Shay locomotives. Unfortunately, it is almost nonsensical without a copy of Michael Koch's book, Shay Locomotive: Titan of the Timber. (Try finding a copy of that title, and if you do, get a second mortgage) I'm not trying to demean Mr Lawson's work, what text there is is well written and informative, and the accompaning pictures are of good quality. It must be emphasized however, that this is truly a supplement, and does not read well on it's own."
3,No bargain,"These are a bit pricey to me, and quite stiff to open and close. Would have been a better bargain if the price were maybe $15 or $20."
1,disappointed,"I was expecting to see pictures of old things collected, loved, and admired. That was not the case. It was my error, and I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this book to anyone that is looking for the same thing."
4,A great resource,"I have used this book as a resource for ideas for assignments, in the community college class which I teach. I have found it very useful."
4,Still the definitive Battleship reference work,"I've had my edition for 30 years, and although it has a certain bias towards German vessels (the ones with unseaworthy freeboard, inadequate crew space, unreliable engines, vulnerable comms systems and no radar) and was denied access to Soviet sources (a problem largely resolved in the companion volume ""Battleships of the World"") it remains the best single volume with almost all one would wish to know about dreadnoughts. There are small errors, but for most readers they are immaterial."
3,Dated data,"Siegfried Breyer's volume on the world's battleships and battlecruisers from 1905-1970 is dated because it does not include the last commissioning of the US Iowa class battleships from 1980 to 1992. Much of his data and technical drawings are just plain inaccurate. His drawings of the Russian Sovietskii Soyuz class battleships are extremely poor and he includes data on a Russian battlecruiser named Tretl Internationale with 8-15inch guns which never existed. I originally bought this book in German and then acquired it in English. As time has passed and more accurated information published, this book although a massive effort has become as obsolete as the ships it describes."
1,This color should have a new name. It's NOT plum,"This ""plum"" bread tray from Amazon came in the mail yesterday and I am VERY disappointed. I have a Fiestaware set of plum dinner plate, small plate and bowl, and mug. I wanted this bread tray to match what I already have. It doesn't, not even close. I would rate this as a zero star if that were available. At the same time I bought the small fruit bowl. It's this new color also and doesn't match anything I already have either.Edit: I came up with a new name. It is the deep purple color of a dark purple eggplant."
3,Small bread tray.,What I was hoping for was a tray that would hold enough bread to pass at the table. These look about the size to serve about two to three people only. The finish and dept of color are good.BP
5,Gorgeous Plum color!,"This bread tray is perfect plum!! The color is amazing, and the tray is so useful for so many things!! Get several of these!"
5,Dynamite is Right!,This is a wonderful release. The quailty of the sound is outstanding. The added bonus of the hard cover book abounds with rare photos of Brenda that I'm sure most fans have not seen and would love to see. I'm looking forward to a next boxed set by this wonderful gifted entertaining lady...Brenda Lee!!!
3,Beautiful Voice,"There are two songs on this CD that capure the pure essence of Patti's beautiful voice. The songs are, ""Love Letters"", and ""Smokes Get In Your Eyes"". I love the sound of the tone in her voice. Those are the types of songs I love to hear from Patti. She sang duets with James Ingram and I loved every last one of them. I feel those types of songs are for Patti, lovely ballads.She has to show off her voice. There are a few other songs on this CD that I enjoy, but the fast songs have to go. At times, it doesn't sound like Patti. One reason I think she hasn't gotten the recognitions she deserves is because of the types of song she has elected to sing. Stay with the ""Easy Listening"" songs, Patti!!Please take a chance with this CD. You will enjoy it if you are a Patti fan!!"
4,Moving collection of old romantic standards.,"This CD provides mellow, romantic standards covered by Patti Austin. It has a jazz influence--good instrumental backround in addition to her melodic voice. I've never purchased another CD by this artist but her voice has a familiar, soothing sound. Really, to take the title of one of the songs, it is appropriate for a Lazy Afternoon or a romantic evening. You will find yourself singing along rather quickly--you have heard most of these songs somewhere else before. It is a good addition to anyone's musical library."
1,A Ripoff,"I suppose if you're going to use a stylus to write or tap on the screen of the Vaio, you're going to need something. But 16 bucks for two pieces of plastic that cost 2 to produce! Further, placing the sheet directly over the screen without getting bubbles or dust trapped probably has to be done in a ""clean room."" And, last, it's almost impossible to get it off without scratching the screen. I'd think twice before I use these."
1,A Huge Waste of Money,"I hate these things. They are difficult to apply, and when you do, it is even harder to see the screen. Buy a simple sheet of clear vinyl and save yourself the money, time, and trouble of these sheets.I bought a package, and expected them to work as well as the much smaller sheets for my cell phone. These are too thick and difficult to apply to make them worth the effort. Ask Sony to get their stuff straight and make something usefull!Ken"
3,Good but wrong size,This product is good but it has a small problem that it is smaller than the screen size with 2 to 3 mm which is not nice when you are working with it
2,"Hard to see, hard to type","Good equipment, but very difficult to read anything on the screen and worse to type. Windows Vista is too heavy for its processor."
2,All hat and no cowboy,Once again a Peachpit/Adobe Press book has convinced me that no one involved in the production of their books ever reads and goes through the book (either before or after it's printed) to either proofread it or otherwise look for errors. Nor do many of Peachpit's authors acknowledge there inevitably will be errors and setup and publicize a web page for the book's errata. Straub keeps up this fine Peachpit/Adobe Press tradition by not providing one either. This book is certainly not for anyone with experience with the individual apps in the Creative Suite but because of so many errors and omisions it's not for beginners either. Don't waste your money on this book unless you're buying it for the many nice illustrations!
1,Missing some of the bells and whistles,"Although this program functions fairly well as a photo editor, there IS NOT a cutout function anywhere on here. Also the free photo paper was no where to be found. The box the program came in is smaller than a standard sheet of paper so I don't know how they intended to get it to you. Also after 10 days I've received no answer to my emails to Data Becker about this problem."
1,Not a good photo editor,"Don't buy this one. Its price is nice, but you are getting what you pay for here. It is just not performing for me. Its red-eye fix is ridiculous."
3,Great if you don't have a sensitive nose,"This product is exactly what I was looking for. It is wider than most wrist rests, which provides just the right amount of room for me. The only draw back is the odor. It almost smells like mildew. I tried everything I could think of to neutralize it, but nothing worked. The company even tried sending me another, thinking it might be just that one. But the second one smells just as bad as the first. If you don't have a sensitive nose, this is a great product."
1,3 month life- then gel comes out,"Unless you want this product to last longer than 3 months, I would not recommend you order it. Even tho' I read the review, I still thought I'd give it a try for the price. I should have listened to the reviewer. It is comfortable and I like it BUT it just doesn't hold up to daily use in the office. The gel has been oozing out after 3 months use and I have tried to figure out how to fix it to no avail. Very disappointing!!!"
5,A must-read!,"This is one of the best books that I have ever read (and I've read it over and over again). After reading Lettice's story, I've been searching everywhere for more books on her. I think Lettice is far more fascinating than Queen What's-her-name."
2,The story without an ending,"I have read several of this author's books, but I didn't like this one. The story goes on and on and on about Lettice wanting to marry Robert. It never really has an ending."
1,Horrible headset,Does not work. Person on other end cannot hear you but static. I ordered 3 of these and they all were faulted.Awful awful headset. Do not buy.
1,Worst $250 ever spent,"What do YOU expect when you hear the words ""day care durable""? Well, I imagine a product that can ""take a lick'n and keep on tick'n"". I must be living in la la land because this piano doesn't even come close to being durable. I gave this piano to my little girl on her second birthday and after three weeks of intermittent play, 13 of the 22 keys have stopped working. The 13 keys are all in a row in the middle of the keyboard, rendering this piece of overhyped junk virtually unplayable. Once again, this was one girl, not a bevy of brawny daycare kids banging the heck out of it. The other day, I saw a vintage Jaymar piano at a local antique store and what do you know, it still worked, had a sophisticated sound and it was priced at only $50. On it's best day the Schoenhut sounded like a sick duck. I just feel ripped off by Schoenhut and will never purchase another one of their products."
3,Piano Keys,I purchased this product for my grandchild. She's only used it 4-5 times for less than 5 minutes each time. Some of the keys are hard to press and difficult to play because you have to hit the keys really hard several times to get anything. I would never purchase another one. It is also smaller than it appears.
4,Great addition to a musical household.,"This was a gift for my son's first birthday. You should have seen his excitement when we gave it to him at his party. We have a full size piano that he's been reaching up to bang on, now he has one his size. It'll be fun to teach him how to play the piano on this toy size. Plus, the sound is quite different from a traditional piano, which gives some variety to my piano playing:) The mahogany color is really more red than mahogany, but that was fine with us and a support piece in the back came ungluded when we removed it from the box, but a little wood glue has fixed that. This is a fun product and great to have in the house."
4,"Fun, sturdy little piano","My grandson absolutely loves this piano. He is twenty months old and sits on the little bench and plays away! The sound is definitely a ""toy"" piano, so please be aware of that before purchasing."
3,it's a toy,"The over all is ok. I do not like the keys you have to hit them hard so they make a sound. If you hit them like a normal keyboard or piano it will not work. good for kids that like to pound on them. Also the bench the only thing you have to assemble the holes for the bolts are to small and you cant get the bolts in, i am going to have to redrill the holes bigger. NO QUALITY CONTROL.The finish is nice."
2,"A Movie,not an Opera","Although Angela Gheorghiu has a marvelous voice and although the other voices are adequate, the lipsinking in this movie really damages the experience of an opera.Also, as noted in another review the orchestration overpowers the singers. The flashbacks,the black and white sequences,the spoken parts and the cutaways to the orchestra,chorus and singers are so distracting as to make this almost unwatchable. I think I'll give my copy to the library."
3,surgilube,"Item was shipped in a few days. The ad said 4 1/2 OZ tube surgical lubricant with the flip top, When it arrived it has the screw top and when I opened the shipping box the box inside that the 12 tubes of lube come in had greasy finger prints all over, but I guess this is the quality we can expect in America these days."
1,Item not as advertised,Ordered this desk tray because of the picture and description. I was looking for a dark stained oak to match my desk. What arrived didn't look anything like the picture. It was unstained oak with a poly coating. Very light in color. Item was labeled as the correct part number.
3,It's OK. Nothing great.,"No one loves Hedwig more than I do. I'm seeing the show for the seventh time in a few weeks. Naturally I had to get this CD, but I was a little disappointed. The dance mixes of ""Angry Inch"" would probably be great to dance to, and I'll dance to them as soon as I get the opportunity. However, unlike many dance songs, the song had little merit when I just sat there and listened to it. In fact, they were annoying. I'd much rather sit and listen to the regular version on the cast album. (I still listen to the wonderful cast album almost every day.) The video clip was also something of a downer. It would have been superb if it had been Hedwig performing a song, but instead, all we get are a few short miscellaneous clips and some voice overs. (Still, it was nice to see JCM as Hedwig again.)"
1,Bears no resemblance to the album,"Being a rabid Hedwig fan (I saw the show more than ten times in six different cities), I quickly snapped this up when it was released. I was beyond disappointed; these ""remixes"" have basically nothing to do with the original hard rocking song, nor do they resemble the sound of the Angry Inch band in any aspect. This is pointless, repetitive electronic noodling and it's nothing short of a disgrace that this dreck was marketed under the Hedwig banner. Some folks have suggested that this is ""club"" music - if so, then I sure wouldn't be a patron at that club. I loved Hedwig because at his/her heart, Hedwig was about rock and roll. This CD single has absolutely nothing to do with rock and roll at all."
2,not worth it,"I have seen one of these in action but let me tell you, the graphics are hard too see and the keys are small and hard to punch and its just a fad after a while you will start using ur pc again and not this. just n=buy a sony mylo for ultra portability"
2,Love it or hate it... Not too impressed at all...,After using this laptop i found that the wireless card has issues... my cellphone gets better reception than my over priced laptop... the data plan is not all that either... everything about it is just overpriced... And why would Sony put out another UX series better than the one they just put out??? Can anyone from Sony explain that or should I just forget it... Sony should think about what pisses people off...But I must say there are some good things about this product... Unique look and has everything in the palm of your hands...
5,The Books continue to be amazing,"From the first time I picked up the first book in the series, I can not wait for the next one to come out. This is truly a wonderfully written series and I enjoy every minute I am reading them."
2,Boring - But give his other books a chance!,"I've read several of these Cape Light books. Most of the others are very good. This one, however, is just plain boring! My goodness I'm almost done the book, and the main characters aren't even dating yet! I have a few more pages and can't wait to finish it. I do like the wholesomeness of the books. You can read these books separate of the others and still follow along very easily. Pass on this one, but try one of the more recent ones in the series. I feel I need a much more juicy story at this point, and I don't mean that in a raunchy way, just something with some kind of plot!"
2,forgettable,"This is the 4th book in the series about the town of Cape Light (geddit? Cape Light?), so I was missing some things about what had happened in previous books.This one--I haven't read the others, nor will I, so I don't know if they have similar themes--is About Second Chances.Two main story threads--a bitter divorced mom and the new doctor in town (who's moved, by the way, to give his daughter a second chance--she has a ""horrible"" stuttering problem which seems to be nonexistent except in his mind), and a long-lost black-sheep brother who comes home. And there was a man who dies and his widow wants to keep their orchard.The stories were uninspired, the characters cardboard cut-outs, and the resolutions of the problems too easy and sugar-sweet--all it takes is a little chat with saintly Reverend Ben. *gag*"
1,more treacle,"Can Molly overcome the misery of her divorce and get her catering business going? Can Matthew overcome his guilt about his wife's death? Can they renew each other in idyllic Cape Light, a Thomas Kinkade village full of purple flowering trees, preternaturally glowing sunsets, cozy cottages, and inhumanely decent people?If you actually have any doubt as to the answers (yes, yes, and yes), go ahead and buy this schmaltzy testament to P.T. Barnam's adage. If you really are one of the ""millions"" who get ""hope and joy"" from plastic ""painter of light"" lighthouses, coffee mugs, and wind chimes, go ahead and get another infusion of rose-tinted happy juice from reading this! Otherwise, maybe you would be better off spending your time and money elsewhere.I would give this exploitative, sickly-sweet book negative stars, if I could."
5,A New Leaf,Great service. I was very satisfied with the book and the timely matter that it got here.
3,Good Story,"The story line in all of the Cape Light Series are sweet, but predictable. Which is okay; sometimes, sweet is nice.The basic problem with these books is the editing. There are numerous typos. There is also an instance of the wrong name being inserted. It is very unprofessional as well as distracting. Contacting the editor did not even elicit a response."
4,Dad Liked It,"I honestly know nothing about the wilds, but my father was pleased with this book when I gave it to him as a gift. He wanted to know more about what trees grow in certain areas of California, and though this is not specifically what this book is about, it is highly informative and it satisfied some of his questions. It also has beautiful pictures and...well..other stuff he liked that I really don't know about...lol. I only don't give it 5 stars because I'm ignorant about the topic."
1,Very poor DVD...Avoid at all costs!,"The quality of this DVD is horrible. In the bottom right of the picture throughout the film there is a logo that says ""RE"", which stands for Reel Enterprises. Hopefully a ""real"" company will release this film with a decent transfer, not one that's been transferred from a VHS tape."
2,One of the best TV movies of all time but....,"This is without a doubt one of the best TV movies ever. The acting by Powers Boothe alone is worth seeing. However, this version is not remastered & quite frankly looked much better on TV in 1978!Buy another version. The clarity & the sound are awful!"
1,I Can't Even Find Words!,"I am a serial-killer buff (maybe I should more accurately say a serial-killer-STORY buff!) and I LOVED this movie when it first came out on TV. When I saw that I could get it on DVD I was thrilled. I shouldn't have been. Both the picture and the sound seem to be a copy (excuse me, a POOR copy) of a poor copy (excuse me again, a BAD copy) of a really AWFUL TV copy somebody made on their VHS hooked up to their TV with rabbit ears . . . (I think you probably get the picture by now ~ which is something you WON'T get on this disk!) 'nuff said???If you buy this ~ don't say I didn't warn you!"
3,Not the greatest quality,"These are sufficient, but not the greatest of quality. I do have to mention that my cat doesn't even care much for them which was surprising."
5,My cats love it,Bought this at the pet store and paid much more for it. Tt was called cat caviar. I sprinkle the flakes on my cats food or just feed for a treat by itself. They love it! Its simple and easy to store in the fridge after I open it or put in a air tight container.
1,This book is terrible,"This is the worst book I have bought on weight loss surgery. It is so bad. It has the most basic information. I flipped through it for 4 minutes and it is now going in the trashcan. There is no substance. I thought there would be a lot more about how to live once you get the surgery, and there is a tiny chapter in the back. The rest is the most common information you can find on the internet. And some really annoying obvious information. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Emotionally Moving,"This has to be one of my all time favorite classics. For those of you who have never seen, then this is absolutely a must! Not that the acting is the best ever, but because it is a classic...and the acting bears witness to the films unusual content. Well, unusual for me to comprehend as the love story is boarderline eccentric, shadow boxing with reality.Story content was believable, clarity of color amazed me...one can plug into the scenery, never wanting to return to reality...How did those older movie producers do that?Keeps your adrenaline flowing, amidst a sweet, adventurous, inspiring, poignant story about tolerance, friendship and yes, eventually trust & love.Crisp emotions frozen in time...some parts were jaw dropping yet, believable...and trust, I'm not alone in remembering this long ago sundry approach in time, when life seemed far less complicated...in some long forgotten era that seemed almost magic, & far far away...you shouldn't miss this one."
4,"Caught in ""The Trap""","I saw this movie one late night on TV in the early 70's while living in NYC. The image of Eve and Jean La Bete discovering themselves set against the Northwest wilderness never left me. Over the years this movie kept creeping back into my head like few other movies have. It is not the best produced movie ever made, but it tells a story that is unique, simple and compelling. Reed brings a ""bull in the chinashop"" masculinity to the character Jean La Bete that at first conflicts with, but then blends with the very subtle beauty and inner strength of Eve, played perfectly and silently by Rita Tushingham. (Tushingham also plays the adult daughter of Laura and Dr. Zhivago in Dr. Zhivago.)I didn't see ""The Trap"" again until a few years ago when I came across a cheap used copy online. This is a very unusual love story. ""The Trap"" might catch you like it did me years ago."
4,Hoping for DVD Release,"""The Trap"" is a movie I used to catch on A & E once in a while. It's an unconventional romance with plenty of action, set in late nineteenth century British Columbia. The mute female character, Eve, is unwillingly purchased by her brutish trapper husband in an unromantic business transaction. She was traumatized by the slaughter of her family during her childhood, and fears this rough man. What follows are the trials of surviving in the unforgiving, frigid wilderness. Will they be able to forge a partnership in survival? Or an even deeper bond? The tale has a haunting quality which revisits your mind periodically, even years after you've watched it."
2,Lousy copy on VHS,"I normaly love this Movie but the one I got was a terrible copy from a VHS tape the quality was terrilbe and I am not happy, it was also prised way to high for that."
5,The Trap,"Watched The Trap thirty yrs ago, enjoyed it. Able to google it came across Amazon only had it available. Thanks"
4,Cute Durable Doll,"I bought this doll for my daughter over 3 years ago because it was from her favorite tv show. She loved it & played with it alot at first. She has since lost interest & doesn't remember the show anymore because she's only 4. We still have the doll & it has held up very well, never developing any holes at all unlike some of the other ones she has."
4,Music that influenced many,"Bonnie Bramlett: the original Delta lady; female Joe Cocker. Her voice is the centrepiece of the album. Her song, Groupie (Superstar) has been covered by Rita Coolidge (on Mad Dogs and Englishmen) and others. But if you've not heard Bonnie sing it, you've never heard it. If you like Lucinda Williams or Sheryl Crow, appreciate the unique twists that Janis, Stevie Nicks and Melissa Etheridge bring to music, you'll love this CD. Bluesy, folksy, rocking gospel. Delaney was the guy who encouraged Eric Clapton to sing. Their love song duets are full and heartfelt (at the time, anyway!) ""Move 'Em Out"" is one of my favourites: the grass ain't always greener. ""Country Life"" sweetly captures that back-to-the-land fantasy that turned into modern-day cocooning and seems to be Delaney's homage to his house full of women.It is my humble opinion that Groupie is about Eric Clapton - either that, or it inspired Clapton's guitarwork!"
4,great book with many applications,"I found this book to be excellent in its detail, instructions are very clear and although the book gives designs for Celtic quilting, it is also adaptable for Celtic knot Applique using bias tubes and also Trapunto or shadow work.there is in excess of 15 pages of a pattern library and the book gives details of various projects including a wedding ring cushion, a cot quilt, a wallhanging, several cushion covers, small cards, pincushions,evening bag, pram quilt etc.projects vary in size and difficulty It is an ideal book for both the beginner and experienced quilter, diagrams have full instructions, many full size and others which need to be photocopied at the suggested magnification. the book gives a list of mateirals required and includes practical tips relative to each project. Colour photography is really excellent and shows some close ups as well. I have now become hooked on Celtic Knot Designs."
1,Battery Dead on arrival,"I really did not get a chance to fully evaluate this product. Thefirst watch arrived with a dead battery. The replacement watchwas running, but broke within a week of using it. The base broke and was not fixable. I returned the watch and asked for my money back.I would not recommend the watch."
4,Metal Rules...Again!,Nice compilation of States bands doing 80's hard rock/heavy metal. Cage's Priest is only a sampling of their roots of their original material; Premonition's Ozzy vocals are uncanny; and Black Widow's Dokken is a refreshing twist to a favorite tune. Buyer beware - you may just let your hair grow again!
5,Fantastic!,"Having grown up in the south and with my family having had domestic help, I could relate to the book. I did truly loved the people that helped raise me and tend to me growing up. I am so glad to have read the book and I hope that others will do the same.....life was so different back in the 40's and 50's. I hope that others will read this book too!"
4,Good book,This book couples gripping interviews with the players and a researcher's overview of the changing relationships between domestic workers and their employers in the South.
2,"Preachy, not scary","The first part of this novel clips along in the style of the Outer Limits. It does a good job of warning about the perils of a Big Brother society.Part 2 is where Bar Code Tattoo completely and utterly crashes in on itself. The pacing is terrible, plotting poor, and the writing weak. Ms. Weyn gets pushy with her message. Characters that weren't terribly fleshed out become cardboard versions of themselves.Unfortunately, this turned out to be a poor read."
4,Good Book,"This book is soooooo good!!!!! I know a lot of people who hate it. But I think it's really good! It really shows us what and\or what could happen to our world. If everyone started caring only about people look like ( which is unfortunately already happening) and what their health records were and etc.. our world would basically fall apart, cause scientists would be looking for the ""perfect person"" and there is NO such thing as a perfect person, unless you like change a human soo much by artificially means, so it's your idea of perfect it really wouldn't be a human anymore it be a artifical person with a little human in then not the other way around. I must admit some of the characters are dull, perdictable and boring. All in all it's a pretty good book."
2,"good premise, not so good writing","After reading the back of the book, I decided to read this. The premise was unique and interesting, and it sounded good. However, after reading it I regret ever having done so. The writing was poor, and the author seemed to flit from one thing to another without a thought of consistency or plot development. One moment she meets new people, then she flees again, then she suddenly develops an aptitude for telepathy. Its hard to figure out where the author is trying to go with anything, and the book as a whole was just a mess. I definitely do not recommend this."
1,Just Awful,"This is easily one of the worst books I've ever read. The plot is poorly thought out, with new plot points springing from the pages without warning and without just consideration. Rather than flowing seamlessly from one event to the next, it seems as though the author added in random ideas whenever she got bored. Every time the scene becomes too static, she introduces a betrayal or kills someone off.And because of the poor planning of this novel, the story begins a million miles away from where it ends, leaving many of the plot points unresolved or only hastily, untidily wrapped up."
4,The Bar Code Tattoo,"Suzanne Weyn created a story that a much deeper meaning than what the title suggests in The Bar Code tattoo. The story is a battle between conformity and individuality that pits a girl who stands for what she beleives in against society. The story takes place in a futeristic era where money is pretty much useless because the bar code tattoo can be used as a substitute for money. The holder of the tattoo can include any information that the holder wants. After somebody gets the tattoo, the tattoo becomes their identity. Kayla doesn't want to become just another code in society, so she refuses the tattoo. This dicision outcasts her and bad things happen. The story was really intruiging and can be read by anyone."
3,Not a bad book...,"Overall, I thought this book was good. I liked the characters and I liked the plot. The major downfall I found with this book is that the author didn't elaborate on certain details that needed elaboration. Because it's a book, I expect for the author to help me get into the characters heads, tell me what they feel like, about their thought process, but in this book, certain events were quickly mentioned and done with that quickly. I would definitely recommend this book, it was a nice read and quite enjoyable as well."
2,"Interesting premise, poor execution","I decided to read this book because I thought it had an interesting premise. The author could have gone in so many directions. She chose...telepathy? Honestly, I don't get it."
3,The Bar Code Tattoo,"The Bar Code Tattoo takes place in the not so distant future, which is corrupt and frightening. The premise is intriguing and exciting, but the book quickly goes downhill. Kayla's character is barely developed, and neither are many of the other characters. The 'Twilight' scenario quickly develops: familiar, kind boy, mysterious, fiery stranger. This problem is solved in record time to make way for the real fireworks. When she flees the city, the narration goes down the drain. Action scenes fade to jumbled peace, with little to no emotional significance. She finds love, loses it, finds more love, loses it AGAIN, and still seems remarkably calm. Characters appear and disappear out of nowhere, with no explanation. The mysterious woman and Kayla's visions turn out to have remarkably simple, cookie cutter answers. If you skim over the (many) discrepancies, this is an entertaining, if strange and confusing, read."
2,"If given the choice, I would have put it down after the first page.","I put this book on a list for my Young Adult Literature class, but now I wish I had of saved the space...for something better. Too much is covered in this book. Trying to make me believe we're in the future fighting against the evil Global corporation that controls everything blah blah blah over does the whole book for me. Could someone please refer me to a good Science Fiction novel...for Young Adults!"
4,Decent EARLY dystopian YA fiction,"Debut near-future dystopian novel. Interesting premise, not so awesome writing. It's most certainly not Weyn's best work, but it is what got her some attention. There really wasn't a huge amount in this genre at the time (2004) and she did well breaking in with something different.I've read reviews that tell you the story is predictable. It's not. Well, it wasn't for when it was first published. Sure...it is now, when dystopian YA fiction is all the rage. The characters are all a little weak, and yes, Weyn has some disjointed connections here and there. But the book isn't a lost cause.The story doesn't wrap up neatly, which is a plus. You want some closure for Kayla and the love triangle she finds herself in while running from the government. So...you pick up the second book."
5,Best Book Ever Writen,"This was probobly the best book that I have ever read As soon as I started it, I had to keep reading until the end! I recommend this book to anybody who likes adventerous books."
4,Good book but...,The author author bases her book off the bible but then throws in evolution didn't really think the two could co - exist together. I think she should of pick one and stayed with it.
2,Poorly written,Idea was interesting but it's incredibly poorly written and the plot is so predictable. Wish I hadn't bought it. Not worth buying - you're better off purchasing any number of other - better-written - dystopias.
3,Entertaining book but I didn't like the style,"I have enjoyed reading this book as a new associate in a mid-sized regional law firm. I find it entertaining because I recognize just about everything he talks about in my own firm.However, the writing style was difficult to read. It was too conversational for my taste. I also found that the footnotes were not funny and evidenced a very ""nerdy"" sense of humor that I couldn't bear after a while. Finally, his use of italics is overboard. I understand that he thinks that a lot of things are important, but I would limit the italics to once a paragraph, not every sentence! It's overkill!"
1,Save your money for another book,"This book is nothing more than the author's attempt to act smarter, and more well educated, than he actually is. From his blatant use of a thesaurus on every other word, to his analogies with Confucius, the Hitler Jugend, the Soviet Komsomol, and hundreds of others; the author tries to sound like a genius.Although there is some useful information, I urge you to save your money for other law books. In this one, you won't find more than two informative sentences before the author deviates to three paragraphs of useless cliches, quotes in foreign languages, and endless rigmarole. The author has desperately tried to make this book much more than it actually is. As a result, the 225 pages actually contain only 20-25 pages of useful information."
4,"Good message, but the messenger needs some work","I think this is a very useful book with some good advice, especially on dealing with the ""types"" you're going to encounter in biglaw and expectations regarding work product, conduct, etc., when you first start. But, it's a bit hard to take advice about being a good lawyer and submitting your best work product when the advice comes from a book riddled with typos and in need of editing. If the author decides to update the book, which I hope he does for future biglaw associates, I hope these mistakes are corrected."
1,Advice that demeans,"Eager as I was to get advice, being a first year associate myself, I was disappointed. The book is, at times, demeaning, offensive, and out dated. Foolishly, instead of correcting grammatical or worse mistakes in his book, the author makes fun of the editors' (reasonable) comments for revisions in footnotes. Also, he distractingly uses made up words like ""and're"", supposedly for ""and you're""."
1,terrible and strangely written,"this was the absolute worst book on being a lawyer I have read, and I read quite a few when starting off law school. The book is strangely written, often incomprehensible, and overall awful. The writer is either completely self-involved to the point where he does not realize that he is incomprehensible, or has some fairly severe mental illness. It is organized in such a way that makes reading it a pain and is extremely dated, to boot. In short, stay away."
2,"Astonishingly sloppy, but replete with decent advice","The author's advice is mostly sound, but the book is so poorly written and, it would seem, unedited that it is hard to take him seriously."
5,Excellent Information and an Entertianing Read,"I am currently a sophomore in college and I picked up this book over the summer. It is full of useful information that will help me plan the next couple years of my life in preparing to be a lawyer. It gives examples of what sorts of thing a young lawyer will encounter. It is extremely informative, very funny, and straightforward. I recommend anyone considering the field of law read this book for a lawyers perspective on the years of law school and beyond."
5,Excellent law practice book!,"Even as a second-year law school student, I can appreciate the insights and invaluable advice throughout The Young Lawyer's Jungle Book."
2,Not as good as Cambridge Int Dictionary of English,"I liked CIDE a lot, so I looked forward to the American version with CD-Rom. More than half of CIDE was removed, though. The definitions and usages are clear, so I would recommend this book for anyone seeking a small dictionary. For those searching for more, either get CIDE (Cambridge Int Dict of English) or Merriam Webster Tenth Collegiate. The CD-Rom is a simple compilation of the text, with a word lookup. No frills at all. The Random House 2nd CD is much superior, as is the MW 10C CD."
1,It's a sad dictionary that doesn't have *any* unknown words.,"This may be a good dictionary for folks learning English. If you love words, however, there just aren't enough here to bother with. Useless for dictionary diving, or a 2nd opinion when the OED doesn't quite nail an Americanism. It *is* well laid out and very clear and might qualify as an accessable juvenile dictionary."
1,not purple,"I received the two I ordered today from Fed-Ex only to find they are red. I called to inquire about my order being wrong and was told it was a misspelling. How do you misspell R-E-D and put in P-U-R-P-L-E??? That's a heck of a misspelling. They only have red and green so they sent me red instead of the purple I ordered. Well, thanks for nothing."
2,stars on 45 .,"i want the rolling stones and stevie wonder (12"" inch mix) here. that was the best stars on 45 album. this is not remastered. as the new ones should. (aad) recording. this is. i hope this helps."
3,Astoundingly good... and bad.,"I remember this Beatles medley from what? the 80s? And it's really clever. The CD is worth it for the Beatles medley and, to a lesser extent, the Stevie Wonder medley. They nailed the Beatle sound absolutely, mixing an incredible variety of songs with a consistent disco beat. Wow! My wife finds the disco beat tiresome but it's somewhat endearing and rather cool. And I hate disco. But as clever as the Beatles medley is, the remaining tracks are just a mess. Songs are randomly put together without rhyme or reason. Yeesh. Buy the CD for the Beatles and don't listen to the rest."
4,Intensity and Inspiration,"Vasks writes music that is at once both accessible and challenging, both minimalist and expansive. Not quite as pure as Pärt, not quite as dynamic as Kancheli, but rewarding and enjoyable in its own right, Vasks's music should strike a deeply responsive chord among those who enjoy the spiritually oriented music of the aforementioned composers. This CD contains five pieces in varying styles, each piece a remarkable composition exhibiting intensity and inspiration, culminating in Lauda, the final piece on the disk, a tour de force for full orchestra and a remarkable 20 minutes of compelling musical expression."
3,"Good,but not more","""Where there is no emotion,there is no art"",writes P.Vasks on his CD.Really,there is an abundance of emotions - sometimes naive,sometimes too pathetic,sometimes over-dramatic or kitchy,like in Cor Anglais.Nevertheles ,""Cantabile"",""Musica Dolorosa"" and ""Lauda"" are worth your attention.I would call Peteris Vasks the most important composer to emerge from the former Soviet Union AFTER Arvo Part,Alfred Schnittke,Valentin Silvestrov,Sofia Gubaidulina , Edison Denisov and even Giya Kancheli."
4,"You Won't Find This in the ""Self Help"" Section!","It all started when I lost my job a few years back. I received ""The Joys..."" as a gift and I have to admit it did lighten my mood and help me take stock of the situation in a light-hearted way. It is now my standard gift to anyone I know who finds himself in the unfortunate position of being unemployed. It's hard to find the humor in anything while unemployed ... every little bit helps!"
5,An Up And Coming Legend,"Deitrick is definitely ""The Stuff Legends Are Made Of"". Each CD he puts out just keeps getting HOTTER! I recomend every title he has released."
1,Oh The Lamb,"I ordered 3 CD's. One of them skip, and I just read your return policies,and because a CD is downloadable, I cannot return it. I have ordered several CD's and books from you, and have always been satisfied. But this time one of the CD's is damaged. Of course it's opened, how else would I listen to it? I am very dissapointed, and will not make any more purchases. The CD is awesome. I would reccomend it to everyone. I just wouldn't recomment ordering it. Pay the extra $2.00 bucks and pick it upfrom your local store."
5,"Absolutely Fantastic Disc: for those who love ""unusual"" music","WOW!!! I discovered Baka Beyond about 10 years ago by accident when I picked up one of their discs (Spirit of the Forest) for a buck at a local used music store. I recently discovered Outback when searching Amazon for more Baka Beyond music. This CD instantly became one of my top 20 favorite CDs (and I currently own roughly 8500 discs). This CD is unique in its approach to the didgeridoo, pairing it almost exclusively with the acoustic guitar. I have since picked up Outback's only other recordingDance the Devil Awayand have been equally impressed with that disc, although it is definitely a very different offering by this creative duo, incorporating roughly a dozen other instruments in their approach to the songs. Highly highly recommended, assuming you appreciate the didgeridoo, and an instrumental world music approach."
2,Overly-dominated by digereedoo,"I really like Baka Beyond, so I got this disk to add to my collection. Sadly, *every* *single* song has a didge droning on in the background. (or the foreground!) OK if you looooove didge, but so many of these songs would have stood so well on their own with out it!"
4,Great CD,"I didn't like this one as much as ""Dance the Devil Away"", but it is still a very good CD. I just liked the spirit in ""Dance the Devil Away"" more than this one. The didg and guitar work are outstanding on both albums-the later ""solo"" material by these two wasn't nearly as good as the magic Outback captured."
5,Excellent way to teach Spanish phonics,Our 6 year old and our 3 year old play with this radio constantly. Has an amazingly thorough catalog of sounds.
4,Brilliant Recording,"This is partly based on a Columbia LP from the 50s--a TV documentary WW II [Air Power] soundtrack. The digital transfer is flawless; remarkably good sound quality, given its age. Excellent soundtrack--highly recommended. One of Ormandy's finest."
4,Fun Film with Great Action Scenes,"Michele Yeoh stars as a confident, self-reliant bush pilot who is cashing in on the resistence to the Japanese invaders in 1930s China. The plot really gets going when she is recruited to assist a spy deep within Japanese held land and ends up becoming embroiled in the resistance efforts whole-hog.The film features excellent cinematography, fine performances by all actors, and well-choreographed martial arts sequences. There were some silly sound effects related to those fight scenes, but that's to be expected in an older film like this one.The only dissapointment I felt was that I would have liked to see some of the plot and characterzation touches. (For example, was the drifter related to our heroine or not?)All in all, though, this is a very enjoyable flick which I highly recommend.)"
2,Great movie !! Pity about the quality of the DVD,"All in the subject. One of the worse DVD coding i have ever seen. A real pity, because this movie is excellent."
3,Generation Gap?,"I really expected to love this book. The material is super interesting, but I just couldn't relate to the author. I'm not sure why. I have struggled just to get through half of it. I'm not sure what it is, but maybe it's a generation gap (I was born in 1970)? I kind of feel like I'm reading something written by my grandmother. I don't want to be mean because I suspect that if I met Meg in real life, we would probably have a very interesting conversation. I think maybe her personality just doesn't come through in the writing..."
4,"Clean, Bright Journalism","This little book is a sleeper, it got me back into real fishing again after an on-and-off few years of chasing bluegill in neighborhood creeks. The best thing is the author's genuine enthusiasm for the rivers of the West & the natural history around them. The only drawback may be that a few of the pieces are a little too journalistic, but most have an aura of wonder almost as if written on a gravelbar or nearby tavern."
4,7200 is OK!!!,"So far - so good. I've hooked it up to the Aux input to my car, so the XM comes in nicely. Haven't used the Nav that much - but works (receives) well with suction cup windshield mount.Recommended."
4,Gets you were you have to go,Its ok but does not store its own power must be pluged in at all times. I had a problem with device and they fixed it first and then sealed very carefully to appear it was never opened and returned to sender to avoid post office fees. fast service
4,Garmin 7200,Very good unit. Only problem is the owners manual leave a LOT to desire. Also there is nothing additional on line.
5,7200WOW,"We received the unit in good shape. READ the directions and set the unit up. Stayed with Garmin's ""Jill"" for the voice, she does the best at pronouncing the street names. Also set up the keyboard like a typewriter instead of ABC etc. It's easier for me. I used to be in tha automotive industry and our products had GPS. NAVTEC supplys most of the OEMs they are the best and I'M sure that's why Garmin uses them. I did blow the power fuse in the plug, but a trip the the hardware store for some 3AG 2.5 fast blow amp fuses took care of the issue. 1.5 amp work fine also if 2.5s are hard to find. NEVER overfuse (Greater the recommended) One last thing I feel real good that Garmin is here in the midwest and their service is outstanding. 5 stars all the way. 7200WOW"
3,Notoour favorite,I am a huge fan of Garmin products but this one is just okay. Recommend investing a little extra to get one with a larger screen and lifetime map updates.
2,not happy,not very happy i paid almost 300.00 for it it should have the most recent map they gave me 2008 mapalso i have at times when i am driving and the map is blank like if it would not have this location in the unit so what i did was i went to address lookup and gave my current location as a location and it showed me where i amso now what do i do
1,Garmin,I purchased this product in January 2009. The maps were outdated and I was unable to download new. I found the screen to be too large for my Honda.
3,Price Wrong,"Why does Amazon show this with a list price of $1599? The manufacturer's suggested retail is $1,071.41."
1,Five Stars - Great Unit,"I had some trouble with my first unit, but Garmin replaced it and I really depend on it. Not just for GPS, but also weather, traffic reports. Get the mount from Ram Mounts so that you can put it on your windshield."
5,"Garmin, Make it truly portable","This unit is great: It is intuitive and easy to program and the big screen is just what is called for when you get my age. The only draw-back is it won't fit on a bean bag and what's portable about something you have to sticky tape on your dash or screw into the dash?? The Garmin tech guy steered me to Ram Mount which makes a heavy duty dash device that acts like a bean bag and a suction cup mount. I tried them both and like the suction cup (it's really industrial grade) better. Garmin- we want to take it for rent-a-cars when we travel. Another screen that they ought to have is total miles to destination and not just to the next fork-in-the-road. Both ought to be displayed. That said, it still is terrific."
5,Garmin 7200,"After having owned several other Garmin GPS's, this by far is the best one. It has many other features that really make using it a pleasure. The extra expense is well worth it if your rely on your GPS while travelling."
4,poor connector,"The connector cord male tip blew a fuse and when my wife tried to replace the fuse the connector end disintegrated. Garmin replaced it and so far no more problem. My wife, a busy real estate agent finds the unit very helpful in her work. There is no adequate mount for use in her Escalade and something had to be jury rigged."
3,Nice but could be better,"I have had this unit for a while. The screen is awesome. I attach it to my vent to keep it near eye-level in my Acura TSX, and it works very well to get me where I'm going. BUT -- it lacks a lot in the usability department. If you want to insert a point in the middle of another route, it takes like 7 or 8 clicks. Then once you do it, you have to hit the Back button about 6 times to back out of every last little choice you made. Literally every last choice. There is no ""just get back to it"" button. Once you get over the crappy UI, though, the unit is very usable. The mapping works fine, the routes are pretty reliable, the screen is large and it does what it needs to. I'd just test the unit before you buy it to make sure you can stand all the damn menus."
3,Not what I expected,"When I opened the box, I was really surprised at how bulky and heavy this unit is. Look at the picture in the 7500 description for a better idea. I don't have a place to mount this monster. Windshield mount isn't an option and dashmount doesn't allow enough height. The size of the part you will permanently glue to your dash is quite large.I wouldn't consider this portable - by the time you connect this to the XM antenna (which isn't portable either), and your radio, you won't be casually moving it.The features, functions and effectiveness may be wonderful, particularly if you have a truck and you aren't concerned about theft. I wish there were better pictures showing the mount and explaining the connections required to make it work correctly.I returned it unused and am considering my alternatives."
5,RVer Review for the Street Pilot,We love our new Garmin street pilot. It is invaluable for RVer's especially if you have a big rig like we do. Our biggest plus is knowing whether our next turn will be right or left and if totally eases our mind that we are going the right way. It's visibility is great and it is easy and FUN to use. We easily transfer it to our tow vehicle and find it invaluable there as well. Hubby keeps saying its the best birthday present he ever got and I think so too.
5,fantastic,"I absolutely love the Garmin 7200 . It is so easy to use ,especially with the remote control. I am sharing it with my brothers who are equally impressed and plan to purchase their own."
4,Garmin Street Pilot 7200 GPS,"This is the best I've seen/used so far. We've had three other units prior to this one. It is still not perfect. We have entered a few known destinations and businesses in the NW USA and SW Canada and searched, and the 7200 was unable to find them. This has only happened a few times though, and as I said this is the best so far. The price was good, and the vendor was really good at getting the product to us in a timely manner."
3,CLAIMS,"THIS WORKS AS WELL AS ANY OTHER GPS BUT DOES NOT KEEP YOU OFF PARKWAYS AS ADVERTISED FOR BIG TRUCKS ,BUSES OR RV'S AS PARKWAYS HAVE LOW BRIDGES."
3,Garmin GPS,This is a nice unit. However it is too large for a standard vehichle. It blocks your view. Also it does NOT have the elevaton as the older smaller version had. Very easy to see the screen.This unit should only be used for motor homes.
4,minor flaws,I love this product with the exception of low resolution screen and why on earth is the keyboard abcdefg... instead of qwerty? This is very strange and uncomfortable. This was a blunder by Garmin which I hope will be corrected. The screen size is awesome and the response time is fast except in cloudy weather and downtown around tall buildings.UPDATE: Garmin issued an update with the qwerty keyboard option. AWSOME! I have had some delays finding satellites even on clear days so my rating stays at 4 stars.
3,available elsewhere,"The two movies collected on this CD are also available on the excellent Chanson Cinema series of Ginger & Fred, Vols 1-3, along with Carefree, The Gay Divorcee, Swing Time, and Follow the Fleet.I can't speak to the quality of this CD, but it would be hard to surpass that of the Chanson Cinema discs, which are superb, and a must for any fan of Fred Astaire."
4,An Exciting Book -- A review by Pedro Cabrera,"This biography about Jim Thorpe, a young man in the Olympic games who won several gold metals, but were taken away from him later on. He also was a professional baseball player, and football player. He was born in Oklahoma, and his parents died of a desise.Jim Thorpe had exciting but painful life. His parents both died when he was young, he got married three times. But the good part was that he was a successful professional baseball and football player. His major goal was to recover his gold metals that were taken away from him.Jim Thorpe was a man with many talents. He played baseball, football, and he competed in several different events in the Olympic games.This is a very good book because it's a biography on an extraordinary man with many talents. And this book is a book full of facts."
5,"with all the trouble in the balkans,this cd is the good side","this absolutely fantastic cd covers music not only from bulgaria but turkey, romanian (rom/gypsy), macedonian, serbian and greek. its a wonderfully arranged compilation of the best rythmic, jazz and soul music to ever come out of the balkans, ivo papasov is up there with the kings of balkan music such as Tode Ognenovski, Ferus Mustafov, and Dragan Alifermovic...absolutley sensational for all jazz and soul lovers."
4,"Long, but worth it","On a lark and with a few minutes to spare, I picked this book up and started reading. The first 20 pages were etnertaining enough for me to check it out and give it a whirl.This was a book that tested the limits of ""do I not finish what I started?"" While entertaining throughout, the first 150 pages or so were annoying in that every story and charecter led to a tangent of another. Get to the point, I wanted to scream.However, it finally picked up, and 630 pages and 5 weeks later, I completed it. Quite a great book, if you can make the commitment. Not surprisingly, many LOL passage, and plenty of the standard Irving perversity: dildos, sex change operations, dwarfs, explicit murders and graphic sex. It wasn't the John Irving book I was expecting to read next, but I'm not sorry I did.Now, where is that new Stephen King book, that I can knock off in three sittings?"
4,Worth a second start,"When I purchased A Son of the Circus 4 years ago, I didn't make it past the first 50 pages. I found it to be a bit slow. Now, 4 years later I (as a John Irving fan) am glad I gave it a second go. If one is discouraged upon starting A Son of the Circus they need only get past the first 80 pages or so and they are in for a treat. By no means is this a typical Irving novel. Yet it echoes his constant and wonderful talent and gift for storytelling. Circus's characters take a while to get to know, but once you know them it's hard to say goodbye. Vinod (the sensitive thug dwarf) brought a tear to my eye near the end. Be patient Irving fans, this book is worth the effort."
3,the longest book about nothing,"This is a very strange book. On over 800 pages J. Irvingmanages to say absolutely nothing. The book isn't boring.It's well written and easy to read, I just couldn'tunderstand why it wasn't squeezed into 200 pages. Not asingle character in the book is in the least sympathetic.I personally couldn't care less if the leading characterswill live or get murdered in the end. Only in two goalsthe book acheaved it's aim: it portrayed the most convinsinggallery of uprooted characters I ever encounteredin literature and during it's unending pages it gives aconvinsing example of the indian pace of life, butit doesn't worth the time it takes to go truogh all thispages."
3,Editor wanted?,"I typically find Irving's books to be good, and swift, reads, but this book was an exception--it took me over a month to get through A Son of the Circus. The first half of the book takes its sweet time setting up probably dozens of subplots; the second half goes faster, as various loose ends are tied up.It was very enjoyable in spite of the slowness, with wonderful characters and great settings. The depiction of Bombay was fabulous; I don't know if Bombay is anything like that, but certainly the picture was imaginatively complete.So I think it's worth reading, as long as you're not expecting a page-turner."
3,Good read for existing Irving fans,"The New York Times review nails the strengths and weaknesses of this book. It is an enjoyable read, with the typical abundance of action and subplots in a John Irving (surprisingly, nobody ever dressed up in a bear suit!). However, the ""issues"" it attempts to address are not handled adeptly as in Garp or Owen Meany. Also, the book took some time to capture my interest--the first 150 to 200 pages (paperback) were slow going with too many characters being introduced. Once past that mark, though, things improved.Definitely worth reading for those who are John Irving fans, but not to be read before his more famous works. One key indication that Son of the Circus was not as well-executed as his others is the fact that about half of the characters whose fates were addressed in the epilogue were people who I had to be reminded of in order to care what eneed up happening to them."
1,"Trivial, with a capital ""T"".","This book is to literature what candy floss is to food.. a whole lot of nothing. I felt totally ambivalent towards the characters, the plot was superficial, the humour puerile. I learned next to nothing about India. Hotel New Hampshire (which I know is highly regarded) lies in wait on my shelf but after this I just can't bring myself to pick it up."
1,horrible!,"this is the second book of John Irving's that I have read, with Cider House Rules being the first. This book was so terrible that I could not even get past the first 100 pages. This is utter nonsense, and I regret even picking this book up from the library"
2,"Excellent Story, Terrible Ebook.",This was easily the worst ebook I've purchased. The punctuation was terrible and there were consistent typos throughout the entire book. It was frustrating and distracting to read such a fantastic story rewritten in such a slipshod manner. Do not waste you time and money on this edition; do youself a favor and savor this enjoyable novel in hard copy.
2,leaden comedy,"This is a huge, hugely self-important comedy that has all the heart and buoyancy of a shard of flint. Irving's quirkiness, which serves him so well in Garp and elsewhere, here just feels neurotic and obsessive. The book is vastly overwritten, charmless in its characterizations and story, and its heart is deader than a stone. It makes me think it's time for Irving to retire."
1,An Irving dud,"I just didn't like this book. I loved so many of Irving's earlier books, but I never believed this story nor cared for any of the characters. If you want to read a great book set in India, try Mistry's A Fine Balance. Infinitely better."
3,"Yeah, what the last reviewer said . . .","I like what the previous reviewer said (the one titled ""Overlong and rambling--but John Irving""). To tell the truth, I can't add anything to that review. So ditto what that one said! And be sure to cast a helpful vote for that review . . ."
2,"Oh, Mr. Irving","Derivative, derivative, derivative. Son of the Circus is John Irving stealing from John Irving. Yes, he pulls out all his best tricks, but that's what they feel like here. In A Prayer for Owen Meany, Mr. Irving goes into your very soul and holds it up before you. It is the most beautiful thing you have ever seen. Here, he manipulates your soul all throughout a great big fat book. Shame on you, Mr. Irving. I trusted you with my soul. I expect great things of you. In the end, one can't help but feel they had read or dreamed this book before."
4,Perfect Road Trip Companion,"A 13-hour drive from Tacoma to Salt Lake City for a funeral was made infinitely more entertaining by the companionship of this book-on-tape. Yeah, it probably could have been wrapped up a little faster, but I was frankly sorry to hear it end. I totally enjoyed the characters, situations, and exotic locations. There was humor, mystery, murder, sex, drugs, religion, transexual prostitutes, circus dwarves...what a ride! I'd highly recommend it for any road trip."
4,Just a very funny read,"Have read plenty by John Irving. This book is untypical of him in the way that it isn't serious at its heart. It's just a fun read, written in the well-known, bizzare Irving-style but without the heaviness. If you want a fun read delivered by a master, read it."
2,"Bombay, Dearest","Some of my most favorite books of all times are by John Irving. Usually when I pick one up, I can't put it down. After reading 100 pages of A Son of the Circus, I can't seem to pick it back up. This novel got away from him."
2,Not Irving At His Best,"John Irving's 1989 novel ""A Prayer For Owen Meany"" is perhaps my favorite book of all time so I had hopes for this one, his first full novel since that triumph. But for some reason, Irving chose to write a lurid, trashy ""Silence of the Lambs"" style murder mystery involving a transsexual-prostitute serial killer and, to make it worse, pads his story out with enough extraneous details to stretch the book out to a ridiculously overlong 633 pages. Saying that this book requires patience on the part of the reader is being kind; it requires endurance. One big problem is that the main character, Dr. Daruwalla, is mostly just an observer and never really develops as a compelling character, probably because he gets lost in the convoluted narrative. To Irving's credit, there are a few interesting characters and subplots scattered throughout but its hardly worth the effort of plowing through this tiresome and at times impenetrable novel to get to them."
2,Typos!,"A Son of the Circus is one of my favorite novels, so I was very excited to get the Kindle Edition for easy reading. I was very disappointed in the amazing number of typos that pepper this edition. The letters r and t when placed close together have become the letter n so instead of tropical shirts you get tropical shins, and this happens in many instances.Read the paper back and spare yourself from having to guess which is the correct word."
5,One of the best John Irving books!,"My first exposure to John Irving was predictably, The World According to Garp (read out loud with a dear friend as we traveled up the Pacific coast. Garp was a complex story, and I still think I should read it again.But I haven't.I went on to other books by Irving, such as The Hotel New Hampshire and A Prayer for Owen Meany. Winners, all. I even read Until I Find You and finished it, even though this was painful to finish.And then there was A Son of the Circus. I'm finishing it for the third time.This book is worth it.There is Indian culture (India), mystery, intrigue, and more in A Son of the Circus. If you've never read a book by John Irving, avoid Until I Find You and find The World According to Garp and A Son of the Circus.And prepare yourself for an adventure!"
2,Tough to get through,"This was one of my least favorite of Irving's novels. I found it kind of hard to read, but I can't put my finger on why- it just felt clunky and I wasn't drawn into the story like I normally am. I had no problems putting this book down and it took me a long time to get through. Normally I have to read Irving's books straight through because I can't put them down! Maybe I just didn't ""get it""."
1,"Tedious, dreary, ugh.","a visit to the dentist for a root canal would be more interesting.I'm so sorry I spent money in this awful, awful book, had I bought a paper version I could have donated it to someone who needs a doorstop or goat food,"
3,not Irving's finest,"John Irving is perhaps one of the greatest writers of this generation. Many of his previous works have been and continue to be used in college literature classes. This is not one of them. While the prose is, as always, exemplary, the story is lacking and disengaging. I found it difficult to connect with the characters and the plot lacked a strong moral element that characterizes his other books such as Cider House Rules."
2,Lifeless. A let-down...,Owen Meany is one of my all-time favorite books with Garp definitely another strong contender. Circus had no energy and was a sheer struggle to finish. The typos in the Kindle version are absolutely ridiculous and I may contact customer service for a refund. Don't bother with the Kindle version. Maybe don`t bother at all unless you`re a diehard Irving fan.
4,Mystery may not be his strong point.,"Now, this was a great novel with a minor flaw. The great character relations are all intact, and the plot is awesome, but the whole epilogue thing was pointless. It killed the story. It could have lingered with me for quite a while if it hadn't been so neatly wrapped up. I mean, it would have been fine if it ended with the last chapter, but the characters could really stick, you would really still feel close to them atthe ed, if we didn't know what the rest of thgeir lives were like."
1,"If you like Irving, go back to Garp or Cider House Rules","I have read most of his books, and enjoyed them immensely. This book, however, was awful. I found it hard to believe that the author of Garp and The Cider House Rules, both excellent books, could write this drivel."
2,Not even close to earlier works,"I am a big Irving fan, but this novel disappointed me. It was confusing...not Irving at his best."
2,A Disappointment,"A Son Of The Circus pales in comparison to Irving's other works. It is a Mystery without the mystery, a Suspense Novel without the suspense, and a Thriller without the thrills. Read this novel only if you don't mind being let down."
1,A Wasted Idea,"I looked forward with great anticipation to this book. Koolhaas' ""Delirious New York"" was a fascinating work, and ""S,M,L,XL"" was both interesting and a great argument against hard drives. This book was a major disappointment. It doesn't delve very deeply at all into it's subject matter (the Pearl River Delta area of China) and most of it's ""important ideas"" are sophomoric. I would say the most irritating thing about this book (other than the totally artless and pointless photographs that litter the book) are the code phrases (highlighted in red) that read like a grad student's compendium of inanities. Don't waste your money."
2,Cliche,"It's great that people are starting to look at this topic, but this book reeks of a quick-hit, let's-publish-a-book-after-a-seminar job. The title itself says it all: the Great Leap Forward was a Maoist economic project in the late 50s that left up to 30 million people dead. How can one use this term, which refers to one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century, as a cute title for a book? The GLF wasn't cute. It has nothing to do with architecture or urban planning. Using it in this cavalier way belies a complete ignorance of the past 50 years of Chinese history. Sorry if this seems like nitpicking, but I can't take a book seriously that doesn't take its topic seriously."
5,Brazilian Gem,"To all of you who know and love Milton Nascimento's work and don't own this album, you're missing a lot! This album brings some of the best Nascimento's songs ever: Teia de Renda. Its heavenly melody is simply astonishing! Also,Certas Cancoes, which is one of the best melodies ever written! I know I sound like a die hard fan, but I can assure you can trust me in this one! Anima is a great, delicious and wonderful album, and it proves that Milton Nascimento is a real genius. Just listen to it. You won't regret!"
3,Good Book,"This was a very interesting book. The translation was a little rough which made it a bit difficult to read, but all in all it was interesting."
5,Great response to the Postmodern movement in the church,"This is an excellent and fair response to the movement that is taking over in many Christian circles. R. Scott Smith has well articulated his analysis and some correctives that he believes need to take place. This could be read by those are familiar with the Emerging Church, and I think even those who belong to this movement would have to conclude that Smith was really fair in his assessment. I really liked his last chapter, ""Objective truth,"" where he really nailed it on the head regarding Postmodernism. Several times I found myself saying ""Yes"" because he said exactly what I've been thinking. Two books that I would recommend in conjunction with this are DA Carson's Becoming Conversant with the Emerging Church as well as Greg Koukl/Francis Beckwith's book on Relativism. Put all three of these together and the Christian has plenty of information to think through the Emerging Church issues."
1,Fake Reviews,"These positive reviews were clearly written by the same person - most likely the author himself. The syntax is nearly identical, the language similarly hackneyed, and all the users share this book as their first review. Coincidences? Nope.Simply put, this book is sensationalist and the content is boisterously exaggerated."
1,waste of paper and my time,"Even as I write this, I am wasting my time on a book that matters not at all. What matters is the fact that its author indulges in shameless self-promotion by spamming Brown students' inboxes. Is it really so bad that he has to spend the time looking up every single Brown student's email address in order to promote it? Apparently so."
2,Interesting Read Yet Extremely Biased,"Out of Ivy is not an especially well written or enlightening read, though the stories of the author's experience at Brown are interesting at times. However, as a non-leftist student of Brown myself, I find the book overtly biased in its gross over-simplification of politics on campus and the type of atmosphere that has been created. Brown is a remarkable institution with a student body that is by and large very intelligent and open-minded; the author unfortunately seems to target specific examples of sheer absurdity which are generally not indicative of overall life here and which do not reflect in the least the sort of experience I or my other non-leftist friends have had. There *is* an over politicization on elite campuses throughout the country, to be sure--and Brown is hardly alone in this--yet an overarchingly insightful and eloquent exploration of such issues this book is not."
1,Very poor,"A repetitive, often trite and condesending look and why he did not like his college experience. The language and repeated views over and over again made it a true pain to read."
1,rambles,"I am a successful stock trader and have been for over 5 years.I also trade ETF's.I have been searching for a good futures book to get a good understanding of the rules of the game.This book is poorly organized.It rambles from commodity to order fillings to exchange to nothing.If you are wanting to learn the basics of the exchanges,what is traded on what and the nuances of deliveries and all the questions a beginner has,do not buy this book.I have stopped reading the book after chapter 8.I can not waste anymore of my time.Any book on the subject is better than this one."
2,Really basic stuff so do not expect much,The book is really basic in nature and tries to cover what the title conveys. I am disappointed that the math involved in most futures and options is not even touched upon (it could have been even without calculus). There are plenty of other books out there that do a much better job in introducing futures with math.
5,"Beautiful, fun, energizing, & powerful",This is incredible music. Every music collection should include this CD. If you like to dance this will move you! Thank you to everyone who worked on this amazing work and gift to us all.
5,Ooo. . .I got the Feelin'!,"Another great Barry CD! This is early-Barry, from 1976, but re-mastered to accomodate today's Fanilows. 13 tracks, a wee bit over 47 minutes total. Old favorites/Manilownian classics are: ""New York City Rhythm, Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again, I Write the Songs, Bandstand Boogie"", and ""Beautiful Music."" Some other popular Barry tunes heard less often are: Why Don't We Live Together,"" ""As Sure As I'm Standin' Here,"" ""Lay Me Down,"" and ""You're Leavin' Too Soon"". A few that I had not heard before are: ""She's A Star, A Nice Boy Like Me, I'll Make You Music, and Marry Me A Little"".A great collection, it includes an 8-page booklet with a couple of young Barry photos and the words to all the songs, so you can sing along. There is also a photo of young Barry with his beagle Bagel. Barry's Bagel-Beagle, I mean, Barry's Beagle Bagel. In the booklet, Barry tells us he got to use his own band on this CD, augmented by by New York studio musicians. It was a dream come true for him."
5,A wonderful read,"Agate Nesaule has captured the horror of war and its aftermath on the life of a young woman who was there.She writes with the authority of one who has experienced the horrible effects of war on the psyche of one who is young and impressionable. Her realism is so that we feel the suffering that she experiences.Although a story of trauma and sadness it does have a hopeful conclusion.A fine story, well written, and intriguing."
4,Maramures,"I can't comment on the jewish music origins, but the local influences are definitely from romanian folk music, not hungarian/magyar.By the way, Transylvania is in Romania, and ""Maramaros"" should be spelled ""Maramures"", which is the name of an actual region in nothern Transilvania. Nobody speaks or ever spoke magyar/hungarian there, although there was a temporary jewish minority before World War II.If you know nothing about the music played by the gypsy musicians don't bother telling other people about it. Gypsy musicians play music for a living, learning songs from the local folklore. Most of the music played by them has nothing to do with their culture; if you listened to a real gypsy song, you would know it."
5,Haunting Yiddish / Hungarian music,"I can't add much to the foregoing review, in which I concur. I was much moved by this music from a world that died half a century ago. Bitter-sweet, joyous and sad. I commend it to you. Buy it."
3,Well worth what you're paying here.,"I purchased this set at Big Lots for $6.00, but wish now that I had bought it here.Big Fat Liar features two of the most fun actors in Hollywood (Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes), who were both likely young teenagers in this movie. Having the two popular young actors makes for one really fun movie. Thunderbirds seems a bit lame at first, but starts to grow on you. The scenes are bright and colorful, and make for an enjoyable, adventurous family film. Vanessa Hudgens is cute and interesting.Johnny English can be either funny or tastelessly bad, depending on your personal taste in comedy (it's definitely not a film for the kids). I thought it was crap.Rocky and Bullwinkle is interesting to a point, though it is not a really great movie. It has a tendency to drag at times. But for what you will pay on Amazon at its lowest price, the set is worth some good weekend fun. Get some friends to9gether, have a party and enjoy yourself!"
3,Not Sure....,"I love all of these movies, and having a set of dvds with four movies is a good idea, but they really should've had the movie been related in some way. Like four movies in a series or movie with the same actor or actors. That aside, this set is great. And it IS the only way to get Big Fat Liar in it's proper widescreen picture. True, you don't get all the same extras as on the single disc releases, but these aren't really the kind of movies that cry out for extensive documentaries or commentaries."
1,Wonderful voice but only average songs,"I have to say I was very excited about ordering Lory's CD. First, I have to say that she has my total respect for releasing her CD independently. Her voice is still strong and undeniably one of the best. The songs however lack of good hooklines and charismatic songs that her producers prepared for her in Europe in the late 80's. She had strong material to go with an extra-ordinary voice. Now Lory's voice can't conceal the lack of good hit potential that is surely missing on the album."
4,Must have for Johnny Rivers fans,I own the vinyl of Slim Slo Slider which I love ! When I discovered the CD with Home Grown I bought it without listening first - Home Grown is not as good as Slim Slo. If I was reviewing only Slim Slo it would be 5 stars.Still a good listen though ...
3,Newer version available,"Slackware 8.1 is a well respected i386 oriented distribution of Linux; however, as of May 2003, Slackware 9.0 was released and 9.1 is under development. There may be more current releases by the time you read this."
3,Taj struggles to keep up with Ali Farka Toure,"Given the success of Talking Timbuktu, it seemed a good choice to team Ali Farka Toure with Taj Mahal, but unfortunately there is very little spark in this recording, with Ali Farka Toure left to carry the load as Taj Mahal seems hopelessly out of step with the music. It was the last album Ali Farka Toure did with American musicians. I suppose it was more a studio choice than it was a personal choice, as Ali Farka Toure long dreamed of playing with John Lee Hooker, which would have been an ideal pairing, but such opportunities are often missed. One is much better served getting Talking Timbuktu or Ali Farka Toure's earlier recordings before he became an international figure."
3,This is just OK,"I like A.F.T. but this one let me down. Not as good as Talking Timbukti, in my opinion.Aside from that, this business of being the 'source of the blues' is a lie perpetrated by over-marketed shills.. For those of you who entertain such notions, take a trip to the library and read some book by some good ethnomusicoligists. Heavy forbid they have to back their statements up with research and evidence.Toure learned the blues the way Eric Clapton did. By listening to records. That will be obvious to anybody who listens to traditional Malian music."
5,Great Product,"These are a bit pricey, but you can refresh them by soaking the sachet with linen spray or fragrance and it last longer. Makes your clothes smell fresh without dryer sheets (which can stain some fabric)."
2,Overpriced,"A fine atlas of sweden, but at $2,350, it's rather overpriced. You should never pay more than $2,195 for any atlas."
2,Potty protagonist,"I could barely finish this book and I am only giving it two stars because it is well written. Macolm Bride is an annoying, prissy fellow and probably drives his students crazy. If the character ages, he will become the perfect dottering old academic. And not to slam silly women, but I kept expecting him to don a tweed suit, pearls, sensible pumps, and a page boy wig. I mean can you really see a man rushing off the the records office after hours and convincing a guard to let him in."
4,A thoroughly enjoyable novel!,Sentimental Music is a thoroughly enjoyable novel combining humor and sensitivity. Everyone I've recommended it to has shared the same opinion.
5,l think this is a great book,"l liked the book alot, l have read it many times, l even remember my teacher reading it to me when l was in grade school. l wish there were more copies of it, because l would love to have a copy of it for myself."
5,EXCELLENT CUBAN,This is a great album. Jesus Alemany is intoxicating. There are seven songs here that are excellent and unforgettable.
5,"This music is energetic, emotional, and professional!","As a Florida International University student, my assighnment was to review a CD I had never heard before. I casually ran into this one. Thank God that I did! What beautiful music! I was never aware of how much energy, sesuality, and eomotion traditional Cuban music contained. The performances by Jesus Alemany and Alfredo Rodriguez are outstanding. Because the music on this album is danceble, I would recommend it to both jazz lovers and Latin dancers. For my assignment I have listened to the album many times. As a result, I have been able to enjoy all of the musical details found in this album. I am greatful to have had the chance to increase my knowledge and appreciation for Cuban music so early in my life."
4,"Accessible, good spirit, not very ""tight"" horn sections","This recording is similar to seeing the group live. Album is more ""rootsy"" than the first. I like it, just had to listen a little more than the first album to get it's ""it"". Compare Cubanismo with Arturo Sandoval's Hot House album. Hot House has got to be one of the all time great big band latin jazz albums. When you compare Jesus' group to Sandoval's incredible horn section re-dubs . . . you will be amazed by the difference. Both very good. On the other hand, it may not be fair to compare these very capable Cuban trumpet players. Actually, Jesus' albums are more focused so far (and in the same general groove) than Arturo's. Out of 6 or more albums, I have found each of Arturo's albums to be so different as to render me confussed as to what he really wants in the way of an audience. Jesus, on the other hand, offers a relatively similar musical offering. So far I like his stuff. Here's hoping he continues to develop this format."
3,ok,"I agree with the previous comment but rate it a little higher if for nothing more than musicianship. Do not regret buying it though, the musicians are great."
2,A collection of afrocuban rythms with no soul.,"The cd is a compilation of new rythms and songs which tags the artists as risk takers. They are not looking to speed up or slow down the classics of the cuban music. The performance is technically correct. The notes and arrangements are synchronous in every detail and this produces, eventually, a monotonous sound. The cd lacks, in great amounts, soul. The first cut ""Descarga de Hoy"" is an example of this. It simply fails to deliver in its performance. Descarga, cuban slang for a jam session, cannot be ""boxed"" in."
5,this book is one of the best of XXth century,"The perspective of mankind that Sabato shows in this book is one of the most talented of XXth century. It is a magnificient narrative body, you will never forget"
4,"What a dump, and I still enjoyed it!","This is a truly unique movie. The leads can't act, the sets look rediculous, the plot is so thin, you hardly know it is there, but it is still wonderfully entertaining. Flash Gordon makes one big joke out of every other science-fiction movie ever made. The supporting cast, led by Max von Sydow and Timophy Dalton gives their best possible performance, even if Dalton has trouble at times to keep a straight face. The sets are so crummy, that they only add to the entertainment, von Sydow has a great time being evil. An excellent movie for the whole family. The children will take it seriously and love it (there is even enough sex to make them think their almost grown-up) and adults will have a good laugh. Either way, nobody is going to be bored."
5,"Interceptor says: If you like sci-fi, you'll like this.","I first saw this movie when I was about three years old. Even then I was already nuts about sci-fi movies. What I liked about it then is what I like about it now. The action and the music. Over all it is a great movie. My favorite part is when Flash and the Hawkmen are attacking the War Rocket ""Ajax"". That I feel is where the music was best of all. As far as the characters in that sceen, I really got a kick out of Vultan. You can't watch him in that scean and not get the impression that he had just been so anxious for that moment that he could taste it. That's all for now but, keep a sharp lookout. You don't know where The Interceptor will turn up next."
4,Flash Gordon (Saviour of The Universe Edition),"Ahhh Ahhhh Flash! My wife and I love these great 80's cult classics. The music by Queen is awesome! The special effects were respectable for the day but it was the mix of romance and humor that is the most entertaining part of this movie. The packaging leaves a little to be desired, we were hoping for a glossy color information pull out cover with juicy information about the movie, maybe words to the songs and some fun pictures, but it is fairly plain, just a 5""x7"" card with a black and white comic book sketch. If you enjoy music by Queen or the semi-cheesy 80's cult classic style movies I would say Flash Gordon (Saviour of The Universe) is a big thimbs up."
4,Wonderful fun,"it cost $22 million dollars to make and every penny was well spent on fantastic sets, a super-camp script and some ridiculously over the top acting. FANTASTIC STUFF!"
3,"Cheesy, but 80's classic...","I'm stretching it by giving it 3 stars :)... I think I was seven when I saw it, and I probably shocked my little mind from the violence, occasional gore, and sexual scenes and ideas presented in this movie, but I must say, it's very nostalgic. Sexy females, strange costumes and equipment, interesting races, and occasionally good acting... haha! All I can say right now is, where is PART TWO??!! They should seriously consider making it with better acting, of course greater special effects with the technology now, and a good story..."
5,Hail Ming!,"Growing up, I thought this was the greatest movie next to Star Wars. As a kid I never realized how cheesy it was, but who cares. I love this movie as much as I did 17 years ago.While the the special effects may seem primitive, they have a unique and entertaining quality about them, I especially like the clouds. This movie provides many entertaining and memorable scenes that fans of cult classic movies will love.Did I mention the super hot Aura or the rocking Queen soundtrack. Hawkmen Diiiieee!"
4,This cheesy movie is so much fun and so hilarious!,"Flash Gordon, came out back when special effects pretty much still used crayolas! ;) But, this movie is really a lot of fun, and it is the good kind of cheesy, the acting is actually good by some decent actors and actresses, the costumes are to bad, bad in a bad way, but along with the cheesiness, they are great! The music by Queen is very cool, especially the Flash Gordon song they did for the movie!If you want a cheesy and very fun sci-fi movie, with some cool actors, so cool music, and some really bad (but fun and funny) costumes, this movie will give you a smile and crack you up, and kids will likely enjoy it!Great job to Sam Jones, as this is his best acting job ever! ;) and Max Von Sydow is always very cool!!"
2,"Unfortunately tacky, degrading tribute to a space hero","Generation X keeps forgetting that Flash Gordon was once the king of Sci-Fi, having bumped Buck Rogers out of that title. It's serials used to have only the highest production values at a time when landing on the moon was, indeed, wishful thinking.Unfortunately, this is all that's left of the Flash Gordon legacy - A tacky, campy film that, barring some unforeseen miracle, nails the coffin shut on a franchise that may forever be known as the story that George Lucas might have revived in 1977 if he had been given the rights.Can it be viewed as goofy fun? Sure, it can. But viewed in the context of what it once was, one can not help but shudder and think of how a great sci-fi franchise has fallen into such disarray. Who knows...maybe it'll be revived, but, then again, probably not. Oh well."
1,DVD Is Scratched,"I recieved the item fast, while opening the item I noticed I could hear the DVD moving around. Sure enough when I opened the Case, the DVD was not clipped into its holder and now the DVD has scratches all around it and is not viewable. Extremely Disappointed. I will be returning this item."
1,"Great Cover, but...","Why do the (traced) drawing of Flash Gordon look suspiciously like Aquaman, Prince Namor, Green Arrow, Shazam...and the Ming Merciless for that matter?"
1,You mean people actually LIKE this???,"I was floored to see so many good reviews for this trashy movie!I saw it when I was thirteen in 1980 for no other reason than I was a STAR WARS addict and would have seen ANYTHING that was sci-fi! But even at that young, inexperienced age I could see this movie was over-the-top-campy, badly acted with bad dialogue.Flash Gordon is probably one of those rare comic book characters that deserves a fresh new perspective; to be remade into a darker, more serious type of film with good dialogue and action, as in the spirit of BATMAN BEGINS or X-MEN."
1,TOO LATE!!! (auwe on you!),"Sorry, you goobs, but I wanted this movie on DVD when I wanted it... many years ago right after it went out-of-print!! So just like what happened with the sizable handful of other movies that I was VERY interested in back then, the same holds true here -- TOO MUCH TIME has passed prior to DVD release (or in this case, re-release) that I have effectively LOST ALL INTEREST in this title, despite the fact that it is now being made available! You keep wasting my time, and I don't waste any money on you! (The ''ONLY'' movie out of the whole group of DVD titles I have thus put a hex on which I am ""still"" making a patient exception for is ""NIGHT OF THE CREEPS."")So suck on it, UNIVERSAL... YOU LOST OUT!"
3,I laghed so hard,"After watching ""Ted"" I couldn't resist buying this DVD to catch up on the joke. As a product of the 80's, I enjoy some 80's acting with a heavy side of cheese. This film did not dissapoint me; I laughed out loud at the quarterback turned intergalactic superhero as he fumbled and stumbled his way through his adventure before stiff-arming his oppenents into submission. The love story seemed underdeveloped and disconnected at times. I give this film a 3 out of 5 stars."
3,Flash review,"Very camp. Music by Queen. Mr. Laurentiis tried to capitalize on the success of Star Wars with this 1980 sci fi epic. Falls short on that account. However, it's fun to watch. Don't take it too serious. A bit dated."
5,Wonderfully entertaining...,"To be honest, I hedge at telling friends I actually like this movie sometimes. However, I just cannot hide my fancy for this totally fun loving movie.If you are a total fussbudget about special effects, you will not appreciate the creativity involved in the old school (non computer generated)type special effects in this movie.It will never be an Oscar winner in any sense of the word. But it brings it's own sense of yesteryear serial that is just too much fun. It's actually silly in some instances. I truly think that sense of not taking itself so seriously is one of the most hypnotic wonders of this movie. It will actually draw you in and capture your imagination.I would love to see a special edition that would have some interviews with Flash, Ming, Voltan, Baron, Dale and especially Princess Aura.Long live Flash..!"
3,"Sure, why not","Why are nostalgia movies such crap? Cool party would be to hand out the popcorn and slide this dvd in. Give it about 15 minutes and you are tired of the movie and Queen. Slide in Avatar and then listen to the conversations RE: boy they've gotten better eh....lively huh. Queen gets 5 stars, the movie one and the ensuing conversation 3 stars."
2,Argggh!,Not sure why I bought this movie sight unseen. I did not even bother to read reviews. I guess I like sci-fi and enjoyed the old flash gordon cartoons as a kid.This movie is incredibly corny and flamboyant. I like it to the old batman and robin tv show. The musical score is pretty darned irritating. The only thing I can say is that the story has a happy ending and the transfer quality of the movie is great.
3,A great B movie with a super score,"Taken as what it is, a B movie, it's thoroughly enjoyable. Adding on a first-rate score made it that much better."
4,What's the matter with these people???,"I love this movie but really.....what is the persentage of people who own huge projection TVs compared to the number of these ""widescreen only"" video releases (particularly on DVD). I watch the thing on my 27"" normal size set and I can't even see the action. Release more movies that have both versions on the disk, please."
2,Flash Gordon,I had to see this movie after it was referenced in the Ted movie. Movie is fun to watch if you have never seen it.
5,Flash Gorden (1980),"I have seen the seriels from the 1930's and 1940's As well as this Movie They are all Great!!!!!!five stars YES!!!! They should rerelease this Movie from 1980 With Sam J.Jones,MelodyAnderson,Jacqulyn Perce(For thoes of you who have seen Blake-7 she played Servolan)in this she's the other Mad scientest the evial one. When and I hope soon!they put this out on DVD again relise it in FULL SCREEN and Wide screen sideA(FULL SCREEN)and sideB(Wide Screen) Put in Both!!!! and as they say LONG LIVE FLASH,DR.WHO,THE SHADOW and HARRY POTTER this fun never,never land!!!!IN THIS DAY AND AGE YOU NEED THESE FUN TV SHOWS AND FILMS LONG LIVE THEM ALL!!!!!!!"
4,A classic movie..,"I got my DVD today and I must say I am really happy with it. I felt like a kid again watching this movie and even watching the theatrical trailer. I loved the interview With Alex Ross, I myself am an artist so I appreciated it. I noticed half the people on here whining about the audio and this and that...and really..It doesn't even matter...this is a great classic film! And if you appreciate the genre then you will love this movie! The people who complained need to learn they shouldn't always sweat the small stuff. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD IT WAS MADE IN THE 80'S What do you expect? Great film..and lots of fun."
4,"""You pitiful fool""","Why, Universal ... WHY? Granted, this isn't a cinematic classic but it's a good time! I've loved this movie ever since I was a little kid and was hoping for so much more out of a special edition. I'm undecided as to whether or not I'll actually purchase this. I'm fortunate to own one of the OOP copies (stumbled across it in a used CD store for $5 no less) and it seems like Universal isn't giving me a really good reason why I should buy this particular edition.I gave it four stars simply because I love the movie."
2,It was a lot better in my memory,"This movie was one of my favorites when i was a child, and i thought it would be awesome watch it again in Blu -Ray. But I was wrong. The acting is so bad that you can't watch all the movie without expressing a laugh for how bad that it is. I believe that some old movies are better to be remind as part of a nice childhood and not as a bad adult experience."
3,"Fun Movie, Bad DVD transfer","Flash Gordon is a wonderfully campy, visually inventive and playful film. Fun for kids and adults alike. Max Von Sidow is terrific as Ming. The DVD transfer is lousy. One of the worst I've seen. Taken off of a bad master no doubt. Full of scratches and quite grainy at times. Audio is fairly decent stereo. Queen soundtrack is just as campy as the film. Color is good. Really no DVD extras. Too bad. 4 star movie gets 3 stars for poor DVD quality."
4,Great Cult Movie,"Not for everyone's taste, this B movie is geared to those of us who are into cult flicks. It is a surreal, disconnected, series of events with great eye candy, really bad acting (so bad it's funny), all blanketed in Queen. Being the Queen fan I am, it added nicely to this bizzare movie and the main reason I bought it. With the exception of the Queen connection which brought me to the movie (I was unsure about this film as I never heard of it and did not want to spend a lot) so I bought this in vcr tape format. It was fine, satisfying my Queen addiction and cult movie taste, especially for the price and shipping costs that still kept it under $5. I liked it enough to consider some day plunking down more serious cash to get the DVD version."
3,SIXTY BUCKS?!?!,"YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! this was a fun flick, but damn. you're outta yer friggin mind."
1,"Sam and Melody recorded a commentary, where is it?","At a comic convention last year they [Sam J Jones and Melody Anderson] were talking about the commentary they recorded for the release, and instead we get this no-frills edition. No sale."
1,Try Again...,"The movie itself is pure fun. The video transfer is great. The audio is not so great. What happened to the bass? I though the woofers in my speakers were not working. The original vhs version of the movie sounds better.The extras are a joke. The cover art was not impressive. The packaging design seems to indicate that there are some cool stuff included the casing. There is one pencil sketch which to me looks very amatureistic...that's it.Everything else about this ""Saviour Of The Universe Edition"" has been mentioned before so I'll stop right here.My copy is going into my ""sell"" drawer, while I wait for some company who has enough interest in the project to remaster it the RIGHT way.I'm very dissapointed."
3,"3 1/2 stars,actually","Campy fun.Loud boisterous,the kind of silly fun that sci-fi movies can be if people stop taking themselves SO seriously[earth to George Lucas}. I tokk three mentally handicapped friends I was living with at the time to see this movie.The soundtrack by Queen was loud and good fun, my friends and I had a hoot. What better compliment can you give this movie?"
1,The only good thing about this release...,"{Flash! Ah-ah...}How many years have we been waiting?{He'll save everyone of us!}How long have we heard about that ""awesome UK release"" with all the cool extras?{Flash! Ah-ah...}And what do we finally get?{Savior of the Universe!}The Savior of the Universe release with crappy cover art (give me the original poster art any day), a featurette about the artist who made the crappy cover art (doesn't Flash look wicked and more like Ming in it?), and a featurette about the screenwriter who also wrote the 60's camp classic Batman, as well as Never Say Never Again.Worth the money? No.Now that this is out, the people who have been selling the original DVD release for ridiculous amounts of money on eBay will have to settle for much less, and those who want to replace their old ones thinking this one will be a great buy will probably be selling their old ones for pennies. And that's the only thing good about this release!"
3,I really don't understand,"I saw Sam Jones at a convention and he said he recorded commentary for a future region 1 release. And from what I understand, The ""Savior Of The Universe Edition"" doesn't have it. So I say, WTF?I could care less about the artist who drew the new cover and how the movie inspired him. He has nothing to do with this movie.How about an interview with the surviving members of Queen about the making of the soundtrack? How about including the commentary from Sam Jones and Melody Anderson. Or Max Von Sydow, who is still alive. And the writer and director. Who cares about a guy that had nothing to do with the film?I am happy that it is remastered. But that should be a given. I own the original region DVD and would really only buy this one if it had good extras. Part of me is still hoping that might happen one day."
4,Dated but AWESOME Science Fiction Classic treatment!,"Sam Jones IS Flash Gordon!This movie is one of the earliest theatrical release super hero flicks. Was it in response to Superman in the mid-70's? Maybe, but I'll tell you this film is fun - and Superman wasn't (have any of them been fun?).The sets are great, the acting is appropriately delivered with intentional tongue in cheek work done as an homage to the serials and radio programs this film follows.Sam Jones is appropriately hunky and handsome as well as athletic and debonaire as Flash. Max Von Sydow plays Ming the Merciless with such devilish fun that you at once hate him and love him.The sets are dynamite and the film does not involve a cheese factor. This is a big budget film with Queen doing the soundtrack and special effects as current as possible (which are great given that this film pre-dates CGI).Pick this film up for your collection. I did!"
5,Voice track,I'm glad this edition is being put out because I had the OOP version and the voice track was off which was annoying to watch the mouths open but the words were off. So I'm happy to get an edition of this movie that is watchable and enjoyable! Plus Sam was one of my crushes in middle school!
4,"What do you mean ""Flash Gordon approaching?""",Enjoyable live action comic book fare with rousing soundtrack by Queen. Don't expect anything too serious and you're in for a great time.
4,A hoot!,"Imagine if Fellini had directed Star Trek- go with it.... And ONLY Queen could do a Wedding March this much fun...Visually a treat- so many great wierd costumes, cheese abounds! A treat for the eyes, ears and....."
5,Great Purchase~!,Received as described and in great time! My 6 yr old watched the movie and LOVES it! I remember watching this movie when I was his age way back when! Such a pleasure to share this cheesy classic with him!
4,Cheezy but entertaining,It's a fun movie with a great soundtrack! Includes a couple good actors to balance out the pretty ones who aren't so great.
4,"Good movie, poor bonuses","This DVD may be a good present for all people who likes this movie, or science fantastic, or comixes, or for Queen fans.But for collectors who previously bought this movie in different editions may be not satisfied about bonuses. 2 interviews, one of it with the artist who painted a cover for this DVD, 1936 serial episode, 1 art work - and it's all? Some customers who wrote review before me said the same - why collectors edition was reliased with so poor bonuses? British Silver Anniversary edition and French collectors edition is much better.And also what is strange for me - the most part of the success of this version of Flash Gordon adventures was because the sountrack of Queen. Many Queen fans bought this film only for it. Why nobody can place some bonuses with Queen - interviews, Flash promo videos, studio works? Very strange marketing politic"
3,Better Extras Might Make You Feel Less Guilty,"This garish Star Wars cash-in takes time getting going, but it provides good 70s fun. It's both ambitious and unpretentious. The picture on the DVD is sharp and colorful, but how about slapping on some extras? A commentary track or a history of the character might have been nice."
3,Such a cheesy version but a great soundtrack!,"After watching Ted, it reminded me of this movie and I just had to watch it again. I'm surprised that Max Van Sydow would have played in such a campy version of Flash Gordon, even produced by Dino DeLaurentis. By today's standards I would expect a lot more from the special effects but even for the time it was pretty bad backgrounds."
3,Not Thrilled With This Release,"I am not going to comment on the film itself-either you love it or hate it. My gripe is with the lack of extras and the packaging. I read an interview with Sam Jones after he and Melody Anderson finished their commentary track for this release-guess what? It's not on the DVD. Also the European version has deleted scenes. This one doesn't. I am very happy that the sound is in 5.1 and the picture is now remastered in 16X9, however Universal went from the original despised ""crapper"" snapper packaging to another crappy cardboard flip box packaging. Even Warner woke up and is now releasing everything in a plastic Keepcase."
4,Unintentionally hilarious!,"I give this 4 stars because of the laughs my family got from this unintentionally funny movie. It must have been filmed with the lowest budget of most any other film. The acting, scenery, dialog, etc. are so hilarious you won't be able to keep a straight face. I recommend buying this if you want a darn good laugh, not if you're looking for drama.It's best if watched with a group - the laughs will just keep on coming!"
3,What can I say that hasn't already been said?,"Well, shoot. Here I was, just itchin' to write a review about the Flash Gordon movie. I was gonna let you know about it being the kind of cheeseball film that shouldn't be taken seriously at all, but is still fun to watch. I was going to go into the so-bad-it's-good acting performances by most of the cast. Throw in my fond childhood memories of this celluloid silliness, and my outlook on the whole shebang would've been complete.The only problem is, it would've looked pretty much the same as all the other customer reviews for this flick! I wouldn't exactly come off looking very original. So if you really want to get the gist of what this film's all about, just read some of the other customer reviews, and ignore mine completely. They'd be no more or less accurate... or different... from what I'd have written.Thank you for your attention......'Late!"
4,Charming,"My daughters, ages 3 & 2 just adore this book - I'm not sure why! Maybe it's because they love to sing ""ring around the rosy"" along with me as I read, maybe because it's such a sweet, charming story, or because the illustrations are so colorful (in a pastel sort of way) and so child-like. I love the illustrations, by Hiroe Nakata who also illustrated one of my all-tiem favorites ""Tell Me My Story, Mama"". Anyway, it's a charming story and is sure to be a hit with any little girl."
3,"Informative at Points, but Ultimately a Disappointment","This book is ultimately a very mixed bag. As a contribution to serious Heidegger scholarship, it certainly provides a good deal of biographical information that has been unavailable up until this point, particularly regarding Heidegger's connection with Japanese and Chinese philosophers in the 1940s and 1950s. At the same time, the underlying thesis, which is occasionally explicit, is that Heidegger stole everything from Taoism. As an interpretive thesis, this offers little that could help someone understand Heidegger in even the slightest degree. While this short book definately kept my interest, it turned out to ultimately leave me wondering whether or not is was really a book about Heidegger at all."
2,Not up to par.,"Some very good songs but the production is so muddy that it is often impossible to understand the lyrics without the liner notes. (A trend in modern folk music I'm afraid and unacceptable from singer songwriters who by definition are trying to communicate something. ""Heartbeats Accelerating"" is still the McGarrigles best CD to date."
4,"Good popcorn, low price.",This is my second purchase of this popcorn. It's buttery and tastes pretty good. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes buttery popcorn.
2,I don't what's happened with this popcorn,"This was one of my ""Subscribe and Same"" items -- but now it's... euuuuuuyuck. The oil is often on the outside of the bag and it's gotten a bitter artificial taste."
1,Have not received merchandise,I soldered this merchandise as a Christmas gift and was informed I would receive it about 12/24/12. Today is 1/4/13 and I have NOT RECEIVED THIS MERCHANDISE.
3,great popcorn,I bought this to hsnd out to anybody who popped in for the holidays that I was not expecting..a group from my church showed up to sing Christmas songs...and I handed them a each a bag...also handed a bag to my neighbors in the apt.complex where I live..everyine seemed to enjoy it and seemed surprised..
1,Contains cancer causing artificial butter flavor,"I love this popcorn, until I researched on artificial butter flavor which is based on diacetyl which can cause lung cancer.I would not give this to my family or to anyone else with such harmful chemicals. You could google for this chemical and find additional information on this.Shame on companies like Conagra which makes products like this. I have fed this popcorn to my daughter several times and feel guilty that I should have checked on the ingredients before.The 'diacetyl' is neatly concealed, look out for a label which says 'Naturally and Artificially flavored' - if it contains artificially flavored - just throw the box away."
2,"Sadly, this book did not live up to my expectations of it.","She is so poetic in her lyrics, but when trying to write for a teen audience (It was a Young Adult book) she dumbed down everything a little too much. And the ending was too ""Gee whiz, everything in life will magically fix itself if you just believe."" But then, most kids books are like that, I suppose."
3,small,"The apron is OK, a bit small, so it won't work for a tall or large man. Came quickly and except for the size is fine."
5,For all Notre Dame Fans Kitchen's,The apron and mitt were a special gift for an 89 year old Irish fan. She's doesn't cook without the apron on now!
1,"Wait For A Proper CD Reissue, Folks!","Alas, what a disappointment. After 20 years' familiarity with my increasingly scratched antique vinyl version of this Brit jazz-rock classic, I was looking forward to having a pristine and cleaned-up version on CD. But goodness knows in which river the master tapes have been lying for the last 30 years - the sound warbles almost completely throughout the CD, and there is wow and flutter with pitch variation. Apparently Beat Goes On Records have promised to try to find a better source to master this album from in future. It's a pity, because in its proper form this is a masterpiece of jazz-rock fusion - or, more accurately, collision! - everything that ""Septober Energy"" attempted to be but didn't quite succeed (even though many of the same musicians play on it), and would without question have received 5 stars from me under any other circumstances. Try to hunt out the original RCA Neon vinyl if you can."
5,"Find a repair sealer that works and now, they've DISCONTINUED it????????","This works like a charm on Coleman air mattresses, so the question is now, WHY CAN'T I BUY IT ANYMORE? WHY IS IT DISCONTINUED???"
5,GOOD NEWS:,"Great news for the fans of Gloria Loring. This CD, ""Turn The Page"" is one of the best she has recorded, but soon another one will be added to the long list. I recieved a letter from Gloria Loring herself and she is anticipating that her new album ""By Request"" will be available in the first part of December 2000 and avaible for shipping by Christmas. To all out there, if you do not have this CD ""Turn The Page"", I do suggest that you add it to your collection. Gloria Loring is a great singer and a wonderful person."
2,From her heart!,"I have seen Gloria Loring perform live and I saw her last week on ""The View"" speaking about her son's battle with Diabetes. She sang ""I Always Will"" and blew me away with her beautiful voice and genuine spirit. This song is the most precious gift a mother could give her child. The entire CD is wonderful. Gloria always sings from the bottom of her heart with every intention to please us all.I also read her new book ""Moving Past The Fear: Living With Type 2 Diabetes"" What a resource for anyone dealing with the disease!!!"
4,A Great Bargain!,"I purchased this kit because it was on sale. I was very surprised when I received the kit and it had more in it than I expected! I use 12 X 12 albums, everything in this kit can be adapted to work in my albums. The colors are great as well. Very bright and modern."
5,I'M A FLURSCHEIM,"I DONT HAVE READ THIS BOOK YET, BUT IN CAPTER 11 MY GRAND GRAND FATHER BROTE SOME INTERESTING THINGS. I'LL TRY TO BUY IT SOON, I ONLY NEED TO KNOW HOW BY THIS WAY."
4,Kind Of Weird & Short!,Here are the CORRECT track listings:1. Solid Rock - featuring Russ Taff2. I Am A Pilgrim - featuring Johnny Cash3. Thank You - featuring Vestal Goodman4. Mercy Seat - featuring Mike Rowe5. Cry - unfinished version...only 5 songs!
4,excellent,"My first sample of John Cale left me very impressed. I particularly like the first 6 or 7 songs, like guts,cordoba,paris 1919. It is Just john on his piano, it's all very natural sounding that's what i like about it. The songs have great energy in these versions and i prefer them to the original versions that i've heard. A great live album."
2,Too hyped,"I listened to the high hype here, and thought wow I will get this item over the cheaper buffers. I do get pedicures, but for those periods of missed appointments, I thought I would do my own maintenance. The item is expensive, but its suppose to be good so I purchased the extra strength #11 and when I got it it reads medium #11. I emailed the seller and asked about why there is this discrepancy and was told the #20 is the tougher but when I read the reviews on that one the feedback scores are low, I really did my research for the first time and veered away from that one to listen to the raves here. But sorry, No, not all that, too much money, and its not living up. Stuck with it, and now when I listen to the reviews here which I tend to do, this is impacting on the credibibity. So I lend my voice to those potential buyers to rethink this."
3,Go with a Microplane if you have seriously dry heels,"I have a fetish for foot files. I have a chronic dry skin condition (itchyosis vulgaris) which makes my heels rock hard, super-dry and prone to cracking (sexy, I know). I used to go to a podiatrist to have the skin razored off, until better foot files started coming out. I've tried many. The worst to date is the Pedi Egg, and the best is the xl Microplane. This is in the middle. It does do something, but for folks with seriously dry heels it doesn't get the job done. I find it's useful after I used the microplane to get the excess skin off, because it's good at softening the skin, but I wouldn't use it alone."
5,One of the most talented artists i have ever heard,"Though ""Way to Blue"" is an Introduction to Nick Drake, it is actually the third LP of his that I have bought. I would recommend this album to anybody. Nick Drake is not an artist you listen to, rather he is an artist that you experience. While listening to his songs you feel what he was feeling and understand what he was thinking. His voice will keep you under his spell until the end of the album, and leave you wanting more. His music, words, and voice become a hypnotic combination as you get swept away in a flood of thoughts and emotions. The talent seen on this album is a perfect preview of what talent the world is missing due to Drake's tragic death. This album is also a well organized compilation, something not often seen nowadays.""Way to Blue"" is not only a great choice for one's first Nick Drake album, but is a wonderful addition to an existing collection of his music."
2,Dont believe the hype!,"Ok- i really like the singer/songwriters of the 70's, and after hearing all the hype regarding the relative unknown Nick Drake, i decided to go ahead and buy this cd (by the way, people recommendation to go buy the box set straight away is ridiculous- who would make a box set the first item to buy of an unknown artist? ). since this cd is the closest there is to a best of compiliation, i listened to it a few times. its dull, melancholic and uninspired. i think drake was a talented dude, dont get me wrong, but he didnt live to see his best work recorded. the only song here i really liked was ""Cello Song""- drake's voice accompanies the cello beautifully. if you want to hear great english folk- listen to cat stevens. if you want to hear great melancholy, give eric andersen a chance. this material by drake is just not interesting."
2,Nick Drake is overrated...,"Nick Drake was supposedly a 'tortured genius' and while some of his songs are 'good' like Pink Moon, when I listened to 'Way To Blue' I found his songs lacking in melodic structure and hardly very enjoyable to listen to. 'Pink Moon' was the only real song I liked. Perhaps I know little about Drake's music, but while he was undoubtedly a fascinating a person, I don't think the myth of his life and premature death should in any way make his music any 'better' than it is."
4,immortalized by VW,"Another Cabrio convert here. I first saw the commercial and said that it sounded like Belle and Sebastian. My husband commented on my young age (26) and how the song ""Pink Moon"" was nearly 30 years old. I was stunned. Truly B&S owe alot to Nick Drake. It took me a while to purchase the album. It was suggested to start with WAY TO BLUE and I am quite happy with it. Some of the material sounds dated like ""Poor Boy"" but reminds me of Patsy and Edina's hippie fantasies on ""Absolutely Fabulous"" and other songs are timeless. I bought it on the strength of ""Pink Moon"" but find that ""Way to Blue"" the most beautiful track on here. It brings tears to my eyes. Worth it. Just buy it. Who cares if it is folk music from the late 60's. This is wonderful music any way you look at it."
5,"A wonderful, wonderful CD","I, as most people seem to, did not find out about Nick Drake from the VW commercial, but from a friend, who in an attempt to cure one of my bad cases of insomnia suggested I try listening to Nick Drake. It didn't put me to sleep at first, but I was instantly captivated by his well-crafted and beautiful songs. My favorites are Pink Moon and Way to Blue. If you want to find a CD that is magically cathartic and wonderfully composed, buy this! but I am left with one question, dude, what happened to Nick Drake? Everyone said he is a tragic figure, but nobody ever says what happened! I am just a very curious soul."
3,Trippy,"Nick Drake has been dead for over 20 years so that may providesome much needed insight as to what you'll be getting (some of thematerial is dated and fits that period of time). Bought it for the 2 minute Pink Moon song from the VW Cabrio advert and don't regret it. The disc as a whole is trippy but gets rather dark in places. Kinda repetitive, too. He was a talented writer and a masterful musician. This recording was produced and recorded to a very high standard. (That's why Ryko is marketing it). If you're into new and different (well, not new), try it!"
5,The most played CD that I own,"As I sat working at my desk on a rainy day listening to a member supported radio station, I suddenly heard this voice and was immediatly entranced. I turned it up as loud as possible, taking it in, not wanting it to end, yet excited to find out who it was. I immediatly knew that The Cello Song was a song that I could not go through life without ever hearing agian. I bought Way To Blue without even realizing that this man has been gone for a long time, and amazed that no one had told me about him before. Since then I have bought the Box Set, the book and wish that this man was still around to enchant me. Way To Blue is the perfect CD for first time Nick Drake listeners. And just when you think it can't get any better, purchase the Box Set, it does."
5,The album I discovered Nick Drake through,"I had read about this CD , was intrigued by it and wasn't prepared for the music - got it and heard it through headphones , which really gives Nick's voice greater potency .I now own everything by Nick .Yes , there is a 'mystique' that probably helps to sell his records , but that wouldn't be much use if the music was terrible .A haunting performer and one of the most influential .Highly recommended ."
3,SHAPE SHIFTING MADE SEXY,"CHIRALITY Book 2 doesn't exactly possess what I'd call straight-forward storytelling, but the art and characterizations more than make up for the narrative vagueness.Urishihara's women are buxom and soft, and so emotionally vulnerable that you're instantly drawn to them. The art is strangely reminiscent of Kia Asamiya at points, particularly the very detailed renderings of technology.Well worth checking out, most especially for the art."
4,Repetition pt. 2,"the music of The Fall is both engaging and off-putting...equal parts clever and brilliant mixed with the confounding and annoying. the casual fan of punk or post rock will probably be confused. and that my friends, may be the point. or maybe not. you decide. take a listen. Dragnet is a close second or third to being my favorite record by this band."
3,Not All That,"I waited some 15 years myself before I heard this, during which time frame I became familiar with most of the Fall's catalogue and came to think of them as one of the great bands of our time.I don't think this LP works well. It lacks the tight musicianship and sonic clarity of ""Live at the Witch Trials"", and lacks the cohesion of the next album ""Grotesque"". Some of Smith's lyrics here are completely self-referential and childish (""Choc-Stock"" for example). Several seem inspired by comic books. The music is amateurish in large part - they sound like a mediocre punk rock band in places (""Print Head"" for example). Three of the tracks hereon are contained in live form on ""Totale's Turns"", and sound much better there.I think of this as an experiment that failed - and fail it did (it wasn't even released in the US, and broke up the band's momentum in England). I hear no must-hear tracks on here. But they did refine and reuse many of the ideas on here in later LPs."
5,The first Fall album I bought,"I bought this when it came out in 1979 and it remains possibly my favorite Fall album, maybe Hex Enduction Hour is better, but I have a sentimental attachment to this one. This is the Fall at their best I think, the album is worth buying just for Specter vs Rector which is a truly astonishing track. The Fall were one of the most important bands of the 70's/80's and of my life."
4,Tales of a Sea Gypsy,"Tales of a Sea Gypsy was an enjoyable book to read and as a cruising sailor it was refreshing to read great stories and not the ""how too"" or ""what I did on my summer vacation"" usual. Ray Jason's writing style keeps you interested, is easy to read and very, very funny. I recommend a cruise through these mini adventures for any diehard cruiser and the many ""I wish I was doing that"" sailors everywhere.Chris on SV Rapture"
1,Tales of a sea gypsy,"After reading the other reviews, including three by the same person, I came to the conclusion that maybe it was just Canadians that didn't like his book. So I ordered the book and started to read and got to page 22 and gave up. If Mr. Jason had left his continuous attempts at humor out, I'm sure it would have been a good book as I'm sure he has very good stories to tell. When I bought the book I felt I could overlook the humor and grasp the story, no way. The attemp at humor is on every line of the book and the key word here is attempt. I am sorry I didn't take the advice of the Canadian reviewers. Shortly after you start the book, your saying, ""Just quit trying to be funny and finish the story"" The author loses credibility by trying to make everything funny and you then wonder if the truth is really being told or if the stories are being made up."
4,Warning you need a sense of humor,If you do have a sense of humor you may find youself laughing out loud like I was during the reading of this book.It left me wanting more. I had read some of the content in a different form via the Latitude 38 Magazine but still thought I got more than my money's worth in this book.A former cruising sailor.
4,For Sailors and Dreamers,"Ray Jason is a natural born story teller with a true talent for writing. His 'Tales of a Sea Gypsy' are a delightful compilation of his own experiences and other fellow sailors tales. Highly entertaining, a witty, charming and poetic chronical. Encounter pea soup fogs, an earthquake, hurricanes, heavy seas and a giant wave. Experience the agony of equipment failure to magical dolphin encounters, and a passage through the Panama Canal. A perfect read for any adventurer who has been or dreams about of going to sea.Erika B.former co-owner of 3 sailing boats (one was also called 'Sea Gypsy')"
1,WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!,"I would strongly recommend to ignore all the positive comments about the book. It is not funny, does not make you want to go around the world sailing. Ray was trying too hard to be witty, he failed. I lent the book to some of my friends, they felt the same way. Plus, the book is a 3 hour read - hardly worth your money."
2,a lot cheaper at toysrus,I bought this for only $34 at toysrus. I don't know why here it is sold for almost twice as much...!?my kids love it but only the older ones (7 and older). The five year old can't build anything with it on his own - he needs help.
4,Cheaper at Toys r Us,$37 at Toys R US......What rip here. I'm losing faith in this site as my means of Christmas shopping. The mark-up is becoming ridiculous.
2,Hard to fit pieces together,"Purchased this after my daughter created several ""inventions"" with her brother's set. We wanted more pieces for her. This set is plastic, the other is wood. I am not impressed at all with the plastic pieces. Many of them were hard for me to fit together and I am quite strong. The plastic pieces also bend--their wooden counterparts do not. The pictures of things to build that come with the kit are in color--but the pieces do not necessarily match the picture..i.e the pink rod in the picture may be the blue rod in the kit that is the same size. Made building the ferris wheel extremely annoying. Will likely return this kit and get more wooden sets."
5,Review for Tinker Toys,This merchant was very prompt in shipping the merchandise. This was a special gift for a young boy and he is very much enjoying this item.
1,Cheap plastic,"I have owned these for about 5 years. Very disappointed in the quality. My child didn't play a ton with them or abuse them but I just had to chuck them in the garbage because the pieces continuously break off into each other & you can't get them out which renders them useless. Plus, it creates very sharp edges when they break. I don't know if the plastic just weakens over the years or what,but unless they have improved the quality over the past years, I would not recommend these. I am going to buy the wooden ones."
2,No instructions?,Very disappointed that there no building instructions. Hasbro says the pictures on the can and the printed insert are all the instructions included. Well I might be a little satisfied with that if the colors of our parts matched the photo's colored parts. Very aggrivating having to decern what colors of our parts match those on the pictures cause the part's colors are not consistant from photo to photo on the printed insert. Legos does it right with step by step instructions. My kid loses interest fast when even his parents are having to decrypt the instructions to build the simple windmill. It's still a decent toy but be warned that these aren't your old favorite wooden parts and you're pretty much on your own to figure out how to build stuff by the included instructions.
2,What does this thing ??,"WHOOOOOOOOOWW! This thing is really expensive. 12000$!!!!??? Damn!!I dont care what this thing does, with that price you could buy yourself like 3 Vsr snipers, and a Vsr shoots at the same velocity than that this gun. The only reason this gun should cost that is that the motor is made from gold and the piston head from diamond, but i doubt that. After all, it only shoots at 320, so i dont know why this gun costs so much. I think someone who wrote the price on the sellers page of this gun fell asleep on top of the ""0"" button, lol!! No way this gun should cost that much."
5,THIS GUN SUCKS FROM THE MOMENT I GOT IT,THIS GUNS SUCKS.IT HAS NO AIM.SUPER HARD TO CHARGE. SUPER HEAVY! THE BATTERY ONLY LASTS ME 1 HOUR! THIS GUNS SUCKS! DONT NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Early Chris Rea,"This CD gives you an idea of where Chris Rea went after his 1970s pop success (""Fool If You Think It's Over"") and before he started writing longer, Dire Straits-type guitar-based tunes. Worth it if you are a fan."
3,syndrom mix,"This book is a pretty good first read for anyone suspecting if their child has a Disorder. It covers all the symptoms that go under the category of ""syndrome mix"", so it gives the reader a start in talking with their doctor about concerns they may have about their child. It was a little vague for me on some issues, which is why I give it 3 stars. I came up with more questions than answers on some topics"
1,"Hardly a ""one stop guide""",Looked into this at Barnes and Noble yesterday for dealing with my daughter's Tourette Syndrome. This topic was discussed for less than 2 pages out of the whole book and gives very little info on what to do about it. Basically it says the child will require medications. Don't waste your money on this book. Find a book more geared toward the exact condition you're looking to research.
2,Kids in the Syndrone Mix,"It was a quick read, but I didn't find it very helpful. Nothing I hadn't already read. Was disappointed I had spent that much money on it. Would not recommend it to anyone."
3,Good for parents not professsionals,A good resource for parents that need some understaning and explanation.It is too basic for professioanls.
4,Worth Your Time,"""Kids in the Syndrome Mix..."" covers a lot of ground on 200 pages of clearly presented, interesting text. As an orientation guide, it is an excellent book that provides insights into various syndromes, as well as tips for dealing with resulting behavioral and educational problems. However, I do not believe reading this book will give you a deeper understanding of what you need and can do to help children in the syndrome mix. But because I realize this may be beyond the scope of the book, and because I am sure it will help you understand children better, I am giving it a high grade. It is worth your time."
4,Great book,This is a nice book if you have a child that is a mixture of diagnosis. I recommend this book. Easy read and load of information.
3,"Helpful, but general","""Kids in the Syndrome Mix"" is helpful and covers the common diagnoses we encounter in the classroom. I would couple this purchase with another title to gain insight into the families involved in these personal struggles, to add a level of intimacy and personalization, and to learn of symptoms first hand. I recommend buying this book along with ""Mommy I'm Still in Here"" by Kate McLaughlin. With both books, you begin to see the whole picture."
5,State of the Art,"This is a groundbreaking, terrific, thoroughly researched and brilliantly written, interpretive treatise of oft misunderstood, frequently diagnosed disorders with numerous interventions, provided by a literary genius.-Gayle M. Bell, EdS, Educational Specialist, Coeur d'Alene, ID"
3,Interesting but not indicative of real life,"I read this book a month before starting law school. I'm now almost done with my first year and can honestly say that it does not really resemble the institution described in this book. PLS made me scared and pessimistic. Maybe I just got lucky with my choice of schools or something, but I have found my classmates to be the friendliest, most down to earth, cooperative people I've ever met, and the faculty has been amazing, too. This book is interesting and may have some relevance, but it seems like it's written by someone with a big, fat chip on their shoulder who went to a bad school. Good luck!"
2,Recipe for scaring you away from the profession,"While the book starts out with some interesting quotes and the author is very well read, the book smacks of conspiracy theory and paranoia.I percieve that the author did not do well OR fit in to his ""top 20 school,"" and as a result, saw this project as a way to make up for a negative experience.The last third of the book is dedicated to making sure you ""really want to do this."" However, it is incredibly one-sided. He presents the negative side of becoming an attorney and leaves out the positive side of legal practice.I found ""Law School Confidential"" to be a much better read. At least the author of that book tells you where he went to school and how well he did.The reading he suggests you read before law school is worth looking at. Don't purchase the book. Borrow it from a library."
5,Are these reviews for real?,"I don't get this. I think whoever wrote the bad reviews read a different book, or perhaps they just don't want to do the work required to follow the advice in the book. Planet Law School is a Godsend. I checked with someone who'd been to law school two decades ago, and another who'd been a few years ago. After reading only a few pages, they both agreed that PLS is right on the money. Dead square. If you don't read this book, or if your do read it but don't want to go to the trouble to follow its prescriptions, you're playing a risky game. Cynically, that's more slots on the law review for people like me. (PS: I made it!!!, thanks to Atticus.)"
2,Thought it was good until I went to law school,"I bought this before I began law school and thought it was fabulous. Then I started following its advice. First of all, the LEEWS program it recommends is a huge waste of money. I went. I learned nothing. The guy spends all day telling you that he's going to teach you something fabulous, but he never actually does. I did very well first semester, but my grades were in NO part due to anything I learned in this course. So take the advice in the book lightly. It sounds good, but some of it is completely wrong. Also, I see the comments above that the books that are out of print aren't - the ones I tried to get that weren't out of print were all backordered 4-6 weeks. I'd really like to know what sort of affiliation the author of this book has with other programs."
3,disappointed,"Received the book in a timely manner. Was very disappointed due to markings, underlining, and circling in book. The book has been very helpful, and gaining additional information."
2,Planet Law School,"There is some useful information in this book. Primarily the sections which refer you to other pre-law-school books and study aids. That information buys it two stars.Unfortunately the rest of the book is not as helpful. There is far too much space devoted to (1) how smart the author is (2) how much he dislikes his life as a lawyer and (3) how you can become just like him.I felt that Law School Confidential was much better, it contains more useful information and less depressingly cynical commentary."
1,TERRIBLE ACCURACY AND WRITING,"I have a unique perspective on this book because the author, Atticus sent me a copy. He sent me a copy because he wrote about my case. Not only did he get the facts completely wrong, he used facts from a poorly written story in a sports magazine about the case. Law students should be given accurate examples and discussions of FACT and LAW. THAT is what the legal profession is about. Mr. Falcon (Mrs.? _ Atticus is a pen name...) owes a responsiblity to his readers to spend time getting the facts and the law right. I was amazed at the innacuracies and the bias demonstrated by Atticus. If the fact finding and legal innacruacies stated in my story is ANY indication of how Atticus handled the other cases mentioned this book is misleading, and arguably harmful, to law students. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,GREAT BOOK! Will help ensure your success in law school. Buy this 12 months out to start working on the suggested readings - You'll be glad you did!
1,Not Helpful,"This book is just a bunch of lurid gossip. It will not help you in law school, and you should save your money for tuition."
1,A professor's point of view,"I have been a law professor for a long time. In addition to thinking about what makes students successful, I have read various studies on the subject. I have read both PLS and the new edition of PLS. Apart from inviting students to take a self defeating attitude towards law school (e.g., his open hostility and demeaning comments about law professors will surely discourage readers from using an invaluable resources), much of his advice will reduce a student's likelihood of success. I was initially amused and then distressed to think how a student following his advice would do on one of my exams: I certainly hope that my 1Ls are not reading this stuff."
1,focus on the lesson,"I actually rate this five stars but nobody will read another five star review. I am applying for Fall 2000 and I am reading all the primers now. I think the point of the author is that Law School is a different animal and he suggests how to approach it successfully. We must do the work. This is not a magic pill. The book is a Godsend because I know that I need to prepare ahead of time. I would be foolish, however to believe that I am garaunteed success simply because I am preparing by the author's formula. My recommendation is to focus on the process of understanding the basics as many one star reviews say and pay less attention to the negative reviews about the author's personal feelings and experiences. Maybe the author needed to take a shot to feel better but the advice in this book is not to be found anywhere else! Good luck."
2,Not necessary,"Law school is difficult, but you can't prepare for it like you did the LSAT.Take extensive notes, ask questions, study hard. Really, it's that simple. You will be reading so much once you get to law school- don't burn yourself out before classes start.Take the money you would have spent on this book and buy yourself some bubble bath."
3,Needlessly Arrogant,"The author does offer a lot of in depth, seemingly useful advice ( I haven't gone to law school yet so I can't know how actually useful it is yet). The tone with which he presents it is, however, flawed. His implied assertion that those who follow the rules of PLS are bound for greatness, while those who don't are doomed to failure is obviously untrue. To assume that I'll be able to effortlessly stomp out all my classmates at a T14 school is ridiculous, the idea that with a few months of study I'll know more than all my professors, doubly so.Additionally, his long rants against the law school system at large, and his ""testimonials"" cause him to come across as one of those free energy guys ranting against the conspiracies of ""the man"" to keep us down.Some editing, some humility, and some Haldol for the author would make this book much better."
3,Hindsight,"I am getting ready to start my second year of law school. Iread Planet Law School prior to my first year. I thought I hadstumbled upon the greatest secret to law school success. I did very well my first year; I even made Law Review. I do not, however, give credit to Mr. Falcon for my success. If I were to have heeded his advice I never would have made any friends or gotten to know my professors. Take the whole thing with a grain of salt. That goes for all of those books that are supposed to prepare you for law school success. If you were smart enough to get into law school you are probably smart enough to figure out how to do well. Some folks just don't try."
5,"SIMPLY, THE BEST","Words can't adequately explain how valuable this book is to the prospective law student. The return on investment for this books is better than you'll ever hope to achieve playing the stock market. I just finished my 1st semester of law school and am in the top 5% of my class thanks to PLS. If there is a secret, PLS - without question - is that secret."
2,this book only recommends other books,This book's only seems to serve as a guide to read other books about 'succeeding in law school'. On almost every other page the author is recommending you buy yet another book or tape or manuel to help you in law school. I stopped counting after 20. The book is only slightly uselful and offers only minimal specific advice on how to succeed in law school other than buying more pre-law self-help books.
1,A lot of hype and paranoia mixed in with some advice,"I'm rather disappointed that I wasted my money on this book. It's got some good advice but not really any different from any other shorter book. The author wastes page space and the reader's time cracking jokes and detailing the so-called conspiracy against the students. Frankly, it's all seems like some sort of attack on law schools rather than a book to help students. Despite an occasional tidbit of advice (which, as I said before, isn't really anything original), you would do better purchasing the other books which are more to the point by cutting out all the useless information this author presents."
1,not really necessary,"My thoughts on this book can be summed up with a quote from ""Law School Confidential"" that starts their chapter on the summer before law school:""A man who suffers before it is necessary suffers more than is necessary"" - Lucius SenecaBasically, he just freaks people out and makes them think that they need to buy all this stuff to do well in law school. And that is the good part of the book. The rest is taken up with rants against the ""law school establishement."" Just relax and enjoy your summer!"
3,"Four star advice, three star package","This book is great and you should buy it. But if you're going to read it from cover to cover, you're going to need a significant amount of time and patience. Between bits of very useful advice, the author rambles ON AND ON about different topics, reprinting emails he's received to illustrate his point or present competing arguments. He also spends entirely too much time being critical of law school professors. I found myself constantly paging ahead to get through pages and pages of material that I really don't need to read. Don't get me wrong, there are some very solid pieces of advice in this book. But at 850 pages you're going to have a hell of a time FINDING the good advice through the long-winded passages. This book should be edited down to a concise 400-450 page version."
4,Knowledge is power,"For all the reviewers who thought that this book was a waste of time, I shudder to think of the intellectual capacity that is floating around law schools right now.This book has excellent advice for gaining knowledge about the material before being broadsided by it completely unprepared upon starting classes. If even 2 percent of those enrolled in law school now took the time to broaden their knowledge of anything the profession would be the better for it.This book has excellent reading suggestions for pre-laws and current students, and the author points out how applicable they are once practicing, as well. Despite his obvious disillusionment with the law, he paints a clear and accurate picture that allows those considering law school to do so with both feet on the ground, adequately prepared for what lies ahead."
3,Nothing Spectacular...,"This book doesn't say anything that other books don't say in a more clear, concise, reader friendly manner. It's poorly written and edited, unnecessarily lengthy, and extremely negative. The author rambles on and on, there is random bold printing throughout the text, and it's extremely repetitive. There is nothing useful in this book you won't find in1L of a Ride: A Well-Traveled Professor's Roadmap to Success in the First Year of Law School (Student Guides), which offers more useful advice than Planet Law, and is a much more pleasant read."
2,Pointlessly Verbose,"The ""PLS Approach"" is terrific, and is one you should follow. However, the ""PLS Approach"" occupies about 10 pages within this 858 page book. The rest is pointless digressions that fail to add anything necessary to your success in law school. I read so many chapters looking for a useful takeaway, only to discover, time and time again, that ""Atticus Falcon"" really just loves the sound of his own (written) voice. Ask someone what the PLS approach is - it can be summed up in two sentences. Skip the book. *Edit* Can't believe I gave this two stars. Tried to lower it to one, but Amazon won't let me. Book is a STEAMING pile."
3,Best at first glance,"After having read this book I would have given it a higher rating. However, when I went to locate some of the books that are recommended reading, I found that more than half of them were out of print! What help is that?!"
3,"Felt like I was in a ""7-up"" commercial","I found this book in my law school--doesn't the author say that your law school doesn't want you to read this book? All of the references to the fact that you're not supposed to tell anyone you read this book reminds me of those annoying 7-up commercials that ask if you are an ""un?"" I find it hard to believe that if you put on your law school application that you read PLS that they would even know what you are talking about. This book is a good resource if you want to know what you need to read before you go to law school; otherwise, it's just some anonymous author trying to impress you with the three years of supposed torture he went through."
3,Enjoyable insight into postwar subcultures,"From mods to rastafarians this books covers the history and social significance of them all. Although heavy at the start the book levels out at a nice factual tempo providing meaning to every subculture youth movent interlinking them and weaving them with the music scene. There are a few gaps, perhaps due to lack of knowledge, which I believe are significant but have been left out. Worth a read if you are intrested in fasion, youth, sociological research or music."
3,book,"Good for what I expected, long postage time but understandable around christmas, also not the cover I expected for the book as the publisher in the image shown was a desirable publishing company, However I dont care I just want the book and Im not anal. Got the book thats all I want."
2,Not my cup of tea...,Not sure if it was me or the book. But something didn't fit.I found a bunch of really neat movies pertaining to this topic instead.
4,A Must Read for Law Students,"An extremely helpful book, no matter whether you're just starting law school or on law review. Includes many small, helpful hints that one wouldn't normally think of when performing a job search. I especially enjoyed the chapters on interviewing--many helpful hints for those difficult questions asked in the interview. The book also contains very good models of resumes and correspondence."
3,Weigh your options first before buying,"Whether you like the author's style or not, you can find the answer to about any question you have in this book. For that reason, it is probably the best buy on the market. A practical note: the large, bold headings provide a good skim if you don't feel like reading everything (or in other words, when time is short). On the other hand, your law school's career services office probably has a handout listing all of these handy tips. Check that out first because reading this book takes time, which is precious, and those short handouts could be just as effective, not to mention free. Also, your career services staff is paid to help you."
2,"Overhyped, warmed over and tired advice","Hey Kimm,The 1980's called and they want their Parachute back.Let me give all potential readers of this book some REAL advice. DO NOT, under any circumstances, answer ANY of the interview questions as advised in this book. I interview law students and applicants to our firm every week. Upon hearing one of these ""cooked"" responses, I immediately put that person's resume/application in the ""No"" file.Do yourself a favor and answer job interview questions frankly, honestly and with originality. Your sincerity will play far better than the insulting routine this author -- and almost every other career counselor -- proposes.I don't know what's more pathetic: the fact that people like this are still making money encouraging applicants to ""sell themselves like an infomercial"" or the fact that other people actually give them money for the drivel they're shoveling."
1,Useless advice,"The advice offered is something anyone who has graduated from high school would know. The author sounds like a cheerleader, constantly reminding you of how well you can do. Her conversational tone annoyed me from the beginning. It makes me glad I got this book off bookmooch, if I had paid for it I'd be upset."
2,"Decent book, but not worth purchasing...","Although the book includes some useful advice, I didn't like the tone of the writing (other reviewers have called it ""cutesy""). I wouldn't recommend buying a new copy of ""Guerrilla Tactics""; however, if you can find a used or borrowed copy, by all means skim through the book for information/advice that can be applied to you."
4,Good Reading for All Soon To Be Law Grads,"Walton gives great tips on how to be a better networker. The book itself is an enjoyable read and definitely SHOULD be read by those who think that only working at those large law firms is the be all and end all of your legal career. I worked as a paralegal for one of those really big firms in Manhattan before going to law school--I now am entering by 3rd year as an evening law student. A lot of law students have NO IDEA what large law firm practice is really like, and Walton really tells it like it is."
4,Outstanding resource,"After the ""Vault Reports Guide to America's Top 50 Law Firms,"" which I got from VaultReports.com, ""Guerrila Tactics"" is one of the best guides I've read for a law job search. Great job!"
5,A must read for every law student,"The books is well worth the price and provides extremely useful, practical, and insightful advice for getting the job that's right for you. A terrific book."
5,DON;T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO REVIEWS BEFORE APRIL2008,"This is the author, Kimm Walton, speaking. ALL REVIEWS BEFORE APRIL 2008 ARE FOR THE FIRST EDITION OF GUERRILLA TACTICS! Amazon just won't remove them no matter how nisleading they are. I spent ten years traveling to law schools and law firms around the country interviewing lawyers, students and career counselors for the second edition, which was completely rewritten from cover to cover. It's much longer because the second half of the book is devoted to ""special situations"" - bad grades, night students, no summer offer, second careerists. I included them in the same volume to save you from having to buy two books. I promise you, no matter how crappy the job market is, your job is in this book!"
4,"The ""Guerrilla Tactics"" may get you interviews, but jobs???","As a recent law graduate, I have tried ""Kimmbo's"" suggestions for networking, resume, cover letters, and interviews. So far, no job, but it hasn't been 12 months yet, so I won't ask for my promised refund at this time. I would say that this book can definitely help a law grad get many more interviews than he or she would otherwise get, but so far, the response I hear from employers is, ""You interviewed well, and I'm sure you have a great career ahead of you, but there was a more qualified applicant who we have hired."" So, as far as making up for poor credentials goes, Kimmbo gives good advice, but don't rely on it as a panacea for your legal career difficulties."
1,Save your money on this one.,"Network, network, network. We've heard it before, and it is this author's ""magic"" tip. The cutesy writing style was also annoying. Don't bother - there are better books out there."
3,Great music - bad recording,Excellent music - Zamfir is the king of the pan flute. Unfortunately the quality of this CD is very very poor - too bad because the performance is exquisite.
5,Better than heavy metal,"Before hearing the Zamfir, I was getting kind of deep into heavy metal. I found the pan flute to be quite the bad... instrument, and one that I can relate to much more than the ordinary/dull sound of an electric guitar."
5,Appealing to both young readers and adults,"Houdini is a gripping story of unconditional love that young readers and adults alike will enjoy. Lots of writers attempt to appeal to both groups, but few strike the perfect balance like T. J. Banks. Having been owned by two siamese cats myself, I almost felt as though I knew Banks' character Jill personally."
5,Love it!,"I love this book as it has great pictures and shows cultural diversity! Also, check outMommy's High Heel Shoes- sweet story about all the shoes Moms wear!"
5,Shoes are the Best!,My son is 18 months and he loves this book. He loves the variety of shoes and the diversity in the book. It's an excellent book!
2,Okay cd...,"This cd is good, but certainly not one of my favorites of Kenny's. I could have done without owning this one."
2,Road and Radio Tour,Here today im witing about kenny chesney Road and Radio Tour CD.I like listing to his music because his music is just so good to hear his good voice sing all his good songs. Last year i went to Freedom Hall and seen his Road and Radio Tour it was an awesome concert. He brings so much enery to the crouds at the concert. That's why he's my favorite counrty music singer.
4,Good. But Not As Good as the Past,"This is a really good album but it is not quite as good as his previous 3 Albums. If you are a die hard Kenny fan you should go buy the album but if just like the singles, download them from itunes for .99 cents. For someone who is not a Kenny fan go buy the Quadruple Platinum ""No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problems"" and you soon will be."
5,Far and Away his best yet.,"After his last few CD's, I had fallen off the KC bandwagon. The Be As You Are Album did finally grow on me however. But getting back to his country story telling roots, Kenny has delivered his best album to date. I'm a big Country music listener and this CD is one ballad short of being on one of the best albums in years. Sounds a little over the top I know, but front to back, this albums is wonderful. Good stories, heartfelt songs and fun tunes all the while staying with his ""remember the good ole days"" feel that he puts into every album. I thought When the Sun Goes down was too much FUN and not enough DEPTH, this album is much better. I only wish he had thrown a good ballad on there to crown the disc."
4,The Road and the Radio,"Kenny Chesney is fun and feels a lot. I love relating to his music! No matter what kind of music you like, you'll like this CD."
5,incredible album,as always...kenny chesney has put out yet another outstanding album. Out of all of his cds no think this one is my favorite.and for anybody who goes to concerts.........the road and the radio tour was the best country concert i have ever been to. GO SEE IT!!!
2,MEDIOCRE EFFORT,"The latest Chesney album, The Road and the Radio is decent. Just decent. Average. Nothing too spectacular. Another word I would use is mediocre. This album is not what should be considered a country album. It has more of a rock type feel to it. Kind of like John Mellencamp meets Jimmy Buffet. After his previous albums with the exception of Be as You Are, I expected a little bit more from Kenny on this album. His other albums had at least a country feel to them. Not so for this one. The top songs are the title track, 'Who You'd Be Today', 'In a Small Town', 'Beer in Mexico' 'Tequila Loves Me' and 'Freedom'. Overall, this one is not up to snuff with ""When the Sun Goes Down"" or ""No Shoes No Shirt No Problems"" but if this is the first Kenny Chesney album you buy, you shouldn't be that disappointed. A word of advice though to Chesney from his more hard core country base is to make the next album a little more on the country side like some of his previous efforts."
5,AWESOME CD,I bought this CD for the bonus tracks and so glad I did they are so great to listen too. Thank You!
5,Kenny plus,I Bought this CD for the extra bonus tracks. I Love it Love it Love it. Especially Brandy
2,Not the best Kenny,I was disappointed in this CD. The songs all sound the same. I'm a huge Kenny fan and own all of his other CD's--this is not like the Kenny Chesney I listen to almost every day. They only good song is Living in Fast Forward--but that is still a pretty typical Kenny Chesney sounding song. After listening to the CD three times I found myself skipping through tracks!
3,Fair sample of his talent,"A relatively good CD. Classics like ""Summertime"" and ""Another Beer in Mexico"" are on this album, and help to make this purchase worth it. If it did not contain those, as well as ""You Save Me"" I would not have bought thsi product."
2,I like Kenny Chesney...,"...but what the hell is the point of putting out an album when you didn't even write the songs? It's a ridiculous concept. This is someone else's heart and soul, not Kenny Chesney's. The only one he wrote has the word ""beer"" in the title. What an artist!"
1,Not Country at all,"Kenny Chensey is a Pop Tart with a Cowboy hat.He needs to listen to George Strait to find out what real country is.Chesney does not rely on steel guitars and fiddles but rather rock guitars and drums.Hip Hop overtook pop radio so pop rock artist like Chesney, Keith Urban and Sugarland had to go somewhere else."
5,Some of his best yet,"This is classic kenny with some of his best work yet. Its perfect for any Kenny fan. ""You save me"" is my personal favorite on the CD."
3,some cds lack bonus tracks,"Im no big fan, but someone had me hear this whole entire thing. I like some of his other discs better, and thought getting ditched by renee z would make for better songwriting/selection.Beware. There are some unlisted tracks on the version I have verses the version I see 'online'. I think these longer versions are on a limited edition. Some said you get these at retail Targets."
3,kenny buffet or kenny chesney,"This cd isn't really all that bad, problem is, the songs all sound the same. There are a couple that are fairly catchy but nothing really that jumps out in terms of music or lyrical content. Basically it seems like Kenny has begun a recycling operation so we will see what he puts out on the next album."
5,Love it!!!!,This CD has a different sound from Sun goes down CD. Its a great road trip disc. I love it.
3,"Not the Same Kenny, But Getting Closer","Many say this is old style Kenny, I disagree. This CD seems to leave off where When The Sun Goes Down, yet seems less personal in many ways. If anyone knows the original style Kenny, they remember I Will Stand and Me and You. Starting at No Shoes No Shirt No Problems, that style began to drift away. We say bits and pieces of more country sounds with island tunes sounding like Jimmy Buffet style. Be As You Are was criticized, but accepted by us fans since it was personal, but definetly not country in a traditional sense. This album is definetly not island, but also definetly not personal. We all want to hear more self-written songs especially in Kenny's situation at the present, but instead we get heavy rock tunes that seem to be obsessive with drinking and Mexico? Im not impressed, Kenny is worthier of better material."
5,Another wonderful CD from that East Tennessee Boy!,"While lacking the truly personal feel of ""Be As You Are,"" ""The Road and the Radio"" still captures Kenny well. Some of the best tracks on the CD are the title track, ""Like Me,"" and ""Small Town."" I personally liked that Kenny addressed each song in the liner notes--giving a little bit of insight into why he chose to record that particular song. I greatly appreciate that little bit of extra information! It makes the CD truly reflect the artist, even though he only wrote/co-wrote two of the eleven songs on the CD. Definitely a plus to the MP3 player and car collection of CDs!!! Great job Kenny!"
1,Disappointment from Chesney,"I have purchased all off Kenny Chesney's cds, and this one is by far the worst. He sings like he is completely comatose. The songs lack inspiration. Maybe he should stick to singing about what he loves, tropical paradise. A friend let me borrow this cd while mine is being shipped; glad I listened to it first, because this one is being returned"
4,Pretty Good Scrapbook-Fun to Record Messages!,"This is a great starter scrapbook!It is very fun to record messages in it.I don't think it is educational at all.The only reason I gave the ''fun scale'' a 4 is because you can't record anything very long,which is very frustrating because you have to talk fast.But this is a very good scrapbook for begginers.OH,and it is very durable!!!!!!"
5,The best magazine about today's wars,"I'm a Brazilian, single and I was born in 1970. I never left my country, except for some weeks. I read just a few issues of this amazing American magazine. Please, I read many other American magazines, also about weapons and wars, but Soldier of Fortune is the best of them. If you want to read what is really happening in places such as Iraq or wants to know what really are Iran, Somalia, Venezeula or even Argentina and Brazil, this is a great choice.For any war happening today, this is the best magazine to read. It seems that it doesn't sells good, but this is the best magazine in its area."
1,Not Conductive,"Not conductive at all. More than 30 meg ohms resistance with electrodes 2mm apart. Conducts NOTHING. Decorative, not functional. I have a masters in electrical engineering, worked in testing for years. I am going to purchase a stainless steel sheet for the desktop and ground it myself with a cord to the wall ground."
2,Kid n' Play - Face The Nation,"This album is horrible. The only reason it got two stars is because ""Ain't Gonna Hurt Nobody"" is worth one star in itself."
4,Gasset wins Again,"For anyone with an interest in the purpose and objectives of higher education, read some pages from the Spanish Philosopher of the early 1900s.Accessible and highly intellectual (at the same time) this book is great for the philosophy student, or any grad student/future professor in any field.It should be part of the modern debate over the purpose of the university: Should learning train the mind to think or act as mere training for the ""real world?"""
1,face plant,"Save your money. I can't say anything good about it. I have a used copy for sale, ..anyone?....anyone?..."
3,very much electronic for my taste,"Very energetic... thought it was more about traditional entonation for indian mantras. However, maybe it will grow on me. I would recommend to listen a bit before buy it, which i didn't do."
2,bad selection,"The Small Face was a band who's strengh mainly came from their psychedelic side. This compilation album, however, mainly features their rock 'n roll material. Only their plain rock 'n roll is too ordinary, even noisy and obnoxious at times. Still there are a couple of truly psychedelic songs. The dreamy ""(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me,"" and more rough stuff like ""Plum Nellie"" and ""My minds Eye."" These tracks instantly brings back the magic and mystery which are far better represented on their albums ""There are but four Small Faces"" and especially ""Odgen's Nut Gone Flake.""Alltogether, in my humble opinion, ""From the Beginning"" has too little of their spicy stuff to make it a good compilation."
4,Weird Fusion by good musicians,"A Balafon playing in a middle of a Flamenco track? Oh yes.Super Fast guitars that jump 3 minutes into a Malian Kora based track? They are here also.My point is that there is no book, list of albums, etc. that the musicians on this album had as reference to make it. They had to use their musical experience to try to figure out exactly what would work. The good news is that they did put a pretty good job. But still sometimes the contrast between the Spanish and the Malian is impossible to hide.While it is true that the Malians on their own often use Latin music to augment their traditions, their use is, like many other Africans, dominated by the sounds of Salsa, not Flamenco. While Rumba Flamenco also uses some sounds from Salsa, those shared sounds from Salsa specifically are not emphasized in this production."
3,Nothing Special,"This product is much more expensive than similar products sold in drugstores, but it does not seem to be more effective. The packaging is also not that great. It's hard to control the amount of fluid that comes out of the container."
1,NOT a standard cable!,"I have no idea what this cable is, but ends do NOT look like the picture and they do NOT fit any standard cable connector. This is useless; I will be returning it."
2,MOTOROLA RAZOR UNL. CELL PH W/CAMRA-RED,"I purchased a (RED) Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Quad phone and paid SEVENTY DOLLARS or more. This is supposed to be a NEW phone. This phone has the following problems: 1) Cannot hear person speaking, 2) When you scroll down letters A-Z in the Phonebook, and hit ex. Le, this phone goes back to the beginning of the Phonebook. You can only choose L, then you have to scroll down all the L's, to get to the right person. 3) This phone is not holding its battery. Although it is a NEW phone that is charged all night, and has a NEW battery, it loses its battery during the day hours. 4) When texting, you have to hit letter and select, which actually takes too much time.Motorola New Cell Phone thru Amazonrmmcdonald@charter.net"
5,Great Reception,This has to be one of the best mobile phones that Motorola has produced. I have owned several Motorola phones(not to mention other brands) and Motorola is my favorite. Battery life is great!
1,I will never buy Motorola any more!!!,"This is the worst cellphone I have ever used. I brought my RAZR in June/2007. The first piece of keys falls from the cellphone in the end of 2007. The second key, which is the ""OK"" key on the panal, falls from the phone about three months ago. And now, finally, the round key disintegrated. The phone itself is good, with a nice battery. However, I wonder, what can I do with a cellphone without keys??? How to dia numbers with such a stupid low quality RAZR! Within one year, this whole thing becomes a crap."
3,wrong color,the phone was supposed to be magenta pink and i got just a pink phone not magenta i ordered a magenta pink phone because it was a replacement phone for the one that was stolen from me that my kids had bought me for mothers day so im displeased with this order and dont have time to ship back and wait for another i wont be using amazon again!!!!!if you look at the add it specifies magenta pink!
3,motorola razr,"Well the product didn't work out for me it didn't recieve pics or vids even though I pay for them on my plan. The service however, was amazing they didn't hassle me at all and gave me a full refund. :)"
1,Bad,"The phone works fine but the battery is TERRIBLE!!!!!! I would have it fully charged before bed, and before the next morning it would be dead. I would have to charge it 5-6 times a day and who has time to do that. I thought it might just be the one I had so I told Amazon and they sent me another...nope, same exact thing happened, the battery wouldn't last 3 hours (and that's with me not even talking on it). I even tried my old razr battery because it works fine and it did the same thing so it was just those phones. Do not get it, it's a waste of your time!"
5,Great Phone,"I think this is a great phone! I've never had any problem with this phone; speaker is great, volumes easily adjust, picture quality is fantastic and battery lasts for a long period of time! Definitely a reliable phone!"
4,thanks,"the service of the OEM shop is wonderful they always are doing the best to please they costumer I,m very happy the way they treat me I will buy again from this company thankyou very much and god bless you all"
4,Unlocked Cell Phone,I purchased a Motorola Razr from Amazon because our cell phone carrier wanted over 200.00 for it because it has not been a year since my daughter had her phone. I got if for 140.00 and my daughter is Very happy with it!Thanks!
1,"Great phone, bad for anything else on Cingular","I just got my first picture message and it wouldn't download. A half hour with Cingular trying to update the software on the phone and another half hour with Motorola and I found out that you can't have any ""browsing"" features on the Cingular network with the phone I was sold. That means no picture messages.Voice calls and SMS work fine, however. I think for $400 the phone might do a little more."
3,Its a HOT pink phone but...,I recently got this phone for Christmas. I love the outside soo much because it is Hot pink and very versatile. The keypad is very cool seeing as it is just like a touch pad. Now the frequent problems i have had with this phone is: 1) It is unable to charge sometimes and i have to take out the battery 2)Its Memory is terrible! for the 2 weeks ive had it now its memory is full 3) its battery lasts for a very short time and you must charge it EVERY night. Now my review is not intitled to disincourage you to buy the phone but if u do you must suffer the consequences. Oh and 1 more reason EVERYONE has it.
1,DO NOT BUY UNLOCKED MOTOROLA PHONES,"I bought this phone and after a few months it went dead! Motorola would not honor the warranty because they claim these unlocked phones are not made for use in the US. I have also written to Amazon.com, but no response! DO NOT BUY THESE PHONES...NO WARRANTY!"
2,H2O,"Never allow your Razr to be near fog, light steam or anything that allows it to obtain any type of water. I do not mean, swimmng or dropping in tub. My Girl spoke on the thing for 45 seconds in a steamy bathroom out of the shower and the new thing is now junk. I buy and sell wholesale items for a living and Razr's are now off my list of items forever. Plus the price is never going to drop for unlocked basic models. Samsung & of course LG is all I will now buy and sell."
3,Pretty in pink...but,"Yes, The phone is small, adorable, rings cool tunes and we know the rest. My difficulty has been with voice mail. The phone is ""unlocked"" but is set up for T-mobile since they are the ones who actually market the pink version. My voice mail works about 50% of the time and I get a note telling me that I missed a call. I emailed Motorola and they said that the phone is ""flashed"" to T-mobile and there is actually nothing they can do and no software to fix it. So beware of ""unlocked"" phones."
3,I Goofed,"This is a really pretty, cool phone. Sadly it doesn't work with my service. But that's my fault, I didn't read all the details. Vendor was super nice."
1,terrible,"This phone was a mistake to order! It would not charge, and my phone company could not activate the internet. Bought a different charger, still would not charge. Waste of my money."
1,Why a deal looks too good to be true,"Gorgeous phone. Ordered one for my wife. After 2 weeks the display started to look ""overexposed"" until it was no longer readable. Returned it to Amazon. Super smooth customer service. But...the phone I received as a replacement (asked for one instead of refund) was clearly a refurbished one. This second phone started to create clicking sounds which came from the speaker and later, again, the display started to look washed out like the first one. This happens gradually so it is not a wrong setting.Very, very disappointed in this product. So contradictionary to the reputation of Motorola. Avoid this phone."
2,:( Worked for awhile then...,This phone was ok initially but then started going off on on. Looks good but...
1,Never again,"These phones suck! My husband and I both have one. We only got them because they were free. The battery constantly dies, you have to charge them every day. I barely use mine so I know it's not dying because of use. I take very good care of my phone and the plastic that covers the keys is peeling off and tends to catch make up and dead skin, nasty! I will never even consider getting one of these again."
1,dont buy this phone,"two weeks ago I purchased a razr which advertised ""video"" feature which it did not offer. The company I purchased from replaced it with another phone for an additional charge. This phone is also useless. If I want to take photos or utilize video I have to buy an additional ""sim"" type card and open phone up to utilize these features. I spent 2 hours at my local AT&T retailer to find out that my 5 year old razr offers more options with the sim card i have . I want to return this phone, but I'm not sure I'll get my money back so I guess I'll just hang onto this loser"
3,T-Mobile,"The phone is fine, just can't do any e-mailing because it is a T-Mobile phone and I use ATT. The color didn't mater I just covered it with a hard case the camera and every thing else works just fine, I just can't sent photos back to my computer."
1,Rzr V3,The item has never arrived and I actually had to call customer service several times to get it canceled for full refund.
3,Good Phone,"If you're looking for a quality phone to make phone calls and send text messages with the flexibility of choosing the GSM provider of your choice, this is a good phone.If you want a phone that plays music and videos, go elsewhere. The box only had the phone and a charger. There was no USB cord for connecting to a computer to transfer media. You have to buy the program Motorola Phone Tools for ~$50.00 in order to get music and other media onto the phone. And the only input is a micro USB jack. There is no 1/8"" headphone jack."
1,It's a mystery...,"When I received this phone it was obvious that it was from overseas, the wall adapter that should've allowed it to charge didn't work. For the most part the phone seemed to work but it wouldn't send pictures or receive pictures. I took it to a retailer and spoke to AT&T Customer Service who were unable to figure out what the issue could be. I ended up ditching the phone. What a waste of $$$$...."
3,"Telephone was good, but the battery was weak","The telephone was in good condition, it was suppose to be new, not sure about that, the battery was weak, and would not hold a charge for more than an hour or two, less if you used the telephone. I replaced the battery and it is working great now. The plug-in charger sent with the telphone does not work. But Because I have had a few RAXR's, in the past, I was able to loccate a plug-in that worked, still I was disapointed that the one I recieved with the telephone was defective. I was not sure who to complain to, so I left it alone, but would greatly appreciate a replacement plug-in charger."
1,Fragile Metal Phone.,"Never drop this phone, sit on it, lean on it, or put your keys in the same pocket. Seems obvious, but this phone is fragile. Ive dropped my plastic Nokia phone dozens of times in the past 3 years and never a problem. But the externeal screen on the RAZR Phone will easily crack, and may kill the phone or fry the battery. Both myself and a friends killed our phones. I broke the Razar with my keys in the same pocket. I thought the phone would be fine with just a cracked screen, however this killed the whole phone. The next day I noticed the battery would no longer hold a charge. If I remember crrectly my friend dropped his which also cracked the outer screen which also killed his phone, but via a failure of the of the internal screen which was undamaged. Other then it being so fragile, it was an Ok phone. Quite thin which is nice in your pocket and a decent touch pad too."
4,Love it!,"PROS : Sleek and trendy. Fits well into pants pockets without adding a bulge to your side. Good quality camera for a phone. All the features are easily accessible. Excellent sound quality. This is the first phone I have ever had that has an effective voice dial system and predictive text writing feature for text messages. Excellent reception (with T-Mobile). Large memory capacity. Easily attached via USB to computers (you can transfer ringtones, pictures, etc.). Lots of accessories have been made for this phone and they are easy to purchase.CONS : The screen is not easy to see when you are in the sun. My battery life seemed to get shorter quickly. The manual doesn't cover much."
1,reception sucks,"we just upgraded to 3 new razr v3 phones 2 pink and one black.the reception is awful.we always have to redial a second time before the static goes away.once it is connected none of us can hear what are callers are saying, the speaker sucks and there does't seem to be anyway to turn it up to level that one con comfortly say i hear you now.we plan to return them"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!,THESE PHONES ARE NOT BUILT IN THE US. THERFORE YOU DO NOT GET THE MANUFACTURE 1YR WARRANTY. I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AND IT QUIT WORKING 35 DAYS AFTER I GOT IT. AMAZON WILL NOT CREDIT MY MONEY OR REPLACE MY PHONE. MOTOROLA WILL DO NOTHING!!! BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MANUFACTURED IN THE US. I WAS TOLD THIS AFTER I HAD PAID FOR SHIPPING THE PHONE TO MOTOROLA FOR REPAIR. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR THE $179 PINK PAPER WEIGHT.
4,Best phone I have ever used,"I live in an area where phone reception is horrible. Although there are pros and cons with this phone, the majority are pros:Pros:1. Out of all the cell phones my family and I have used, this one takes the shortest time to connect as well2. Clarity with every conversation3. Numerous amount of features.4. aesthetics5. battery life is longCons:1. like most phones and services, accessories and fees for extra services (i.e. for verizon the V-cast feature is aprox $15)2. The camera is good for about a 1.0MP but the zoom blurs once you reach the max 4x.3. It is rumored that after a few years, the screen blinks. This is TBD and I personally have not heard of any other technical error(s).In general if you take good care of the phone, the phone should work."
1,Looks is all it has going for it,"I bought the pink motorola razor 2 months ago. About 2 weeks after I bought the phone it started locking up. The keypad would not work. Powering the phone off did not work. I took the phone back to the T-mobile store and was told I had to contact Motorola. The next day it started working again. It had intermittant lock ups, and made beeping noises on it's own. 3 days ago, it locked up and is still not working. I had to buy a new phone. Motorola nor T-Mobile would replace it. Both say it has to have been dropped or has water damage, and neither of these is the case.Lesson learned, not everything that is pretty on the outside is pretty on the inside. Save your money, get a better quality phone."
3,Great phone...as long as it works.,I got the Magenta Razr in December. It was defective. I got a big blank screen when it was opened after being closed for just minutes. If you get the phone at T-Mobile it has a 1 year warranty. I used that and my new Razr works just fine and dandy.But the phone sold here on Amazon is way too expensive and is without a warranty...so I'd be weary.
5,A Sweet Pink Razr,"The Moto Razr V3 is the best cell phone I've owned.I have the Magenta color and its a beautiful shade of pinkNone of the cell companies in my town even carry this color Razr.It's smooth, and has a nice key pad with a blue back lite.Takes pictures and video's.It has picture ID so you can see who is calling on the outter smaller screen and the inside larger screenIt also has the ringer assigning featureHas a nice feel to it.All in all this is a classy, smooth, compact phone. Does pretty much everything a phone needs to do and more..I love mine, and am glad I chose it."
3,Motorola RAZR V3,I was disappointed with this phone because it has such a short battery life. It needs to be recharged every 4 hours !!!
2,item appears to be a refurb,"The first phone I received was obviously a used or refurbished phone. The manual was dogeared and the phone had signs of wear & tear. The phone's speaker volume was poor. So I sent it back. The second phone was functional, but the manual was for another phone. The packaging was very worn and the cord had obviously been used. I kept the phone since it worked, but this product is well below the typical amazon quality that I expect."
2,The Phone had a defect with the keypad,I recieved this phone and within two days the keypad would not respond. I returned the phone. It took several weeks on some e-mails but I was issued a refund for the phone.
1,Beware Of The Dreaded Celly Phone,"I really love every razr out their, but see here's the problem. This phone does NOT WORK WITH VERIZON WIRELESS. So if you are like me and wanted it and have Verizon, just buy the phone at verizon. This phone is not compatibe with the Verizon Wirless service. You need a SIM card for this phone, and with Verizon, it is computer autherized. Don't waste your money looking for it on Amazon, or on the internet. Save your self at least 200 $ and go to the store or Verizon Online. It is NOT WORTH IT. Other Than that little factor, I totally think you should go for this phone, (if your not Verzon!) but Beware Of the Dreaded Celly Phone.Don't fool your self over the UNLOCKED thing. It really doesn't make a difference."
4,Pink Razr,"You can purchase this phone on ibuyplasma.com for $298.99 and you get the pink razr phone, HS820 Bluetooth headset, a car charger, and belt clip for that price of $298.99! Can't beat that!"
4,great phone,"was reading other reviews, and many people are idiots. most of them have a RAZR, but probably not this version. the black or silver one perhaps. the pink'ness of this phone makes is worthwhile.this is the third version, which is the best of all RAZR's. some guy said, want an mp3 player, buy an mp3 player. want a camera buy a camera...etc. well, this handy object has all, not to be the best but to be somewhat a toy. if you buy it for those features, you're stupid. buy it as a phone and see everything else as an extra. i have this pone, an iPod and a digital camera.i love this phone. it's a motorola so it's sturdy. drop it and you're ok, not like a nokia phone. i used to have a nokia phone, and i love nokia because it's so easy to use, but this pink phone was too cute to let up.this hot pink phone is of the ""bratty"" variety. that's it's unique selling point. don't get me wrong, it's a good phone too...but you can find a cheaper one out there if you don't care what your phone looks like."
4,Realistic Picture of WWI,"Started out slow, Boyd seemed caught up in using as many adjectives as a sentence could hold. Once I got past that and was able to focus on his story it flowed easily. His accurate depiction of what it was like for the average Marine was outstanding. A very good read of USMC WWI history."
3,Realistic war picture,"This is a novel about what it was lke fighting in the trenches of WW I. Edmund Wilson among others thought it one of the best war novels in our literature. Boyd is a fierce realist (he was a soldier in the war, too) and pulls no punches. Death and misery are everywhere, and no one really knows what they're doing there. But Boyd is only a mediocre writer, and the realism, though praiseworthy, is not enough. The writing is flat."
2,Knee Deep in Adjectives,"I consider the writing substandard. The overly ripe adjectives do not paint convincing pictures. Boyd is compelling when limning the tedium of the trenches or the terror of attacking over No Man's Land. He bogs down when trying for artistic embellishment. As a description by someone who was there, the book is rewarding to WWI buffs, but as literature it is as leaden as a pair of muddy boots."
3,"""Becoming Human"" by Ian Tattersall","I would give Tattersall a ""good"", but not ""excellent"" rating for this book. When he discusses fossil evidence, he is so heavily nuanced that he almost says nothing at all. When he talks in generalities, I long for him to provide some facts to substantiate the conjectures. Usually a superb illustrator, in this book he has provided virtually none. On the plus side, he took on a challenging task, and worked hard to accomplish it.I agree with him on many points that he makes.Ralph Hermansen 9/7/06"
2,a slowly presented yet fascinating tale of our evolution,"Quite slow but well written, well, that's if you don't mind being repeatedly told that more was coming and that you weren't yet prepared to understand the material until later in the book. Outside this, the book really did tell a great tale. But I was hoping for something less elementary and more on new discoveries in the on going search for our human ancestors."
2,"Lots of words, limited content.","I bought this book based on a review in Scientific American. Though Mr. Tattersall's credentials are impressive, the book was not. I had expected something that would explain new insights we have gained into human evolution based on recent archeological findings. The book seems rather to be a long, wordy speculation on humanness, citing relatively few actual facts to back up assertions and lacking information on recent discoveries. Another thoughtful colleague of mine had about the same reaction. It also included a long (again) discussion of the irrelevant topic of trying to teach primates sign language. For me, it was not worth $18.00."
2,"It fulfills this year's required ""Publish or die"" demand.","Tattersall is undoubtedly 'the authority' on human evolution. He has not,in this book, made the subject interesting. That's unfortunate. He comments on the latest findings and opinions regarding human origins and takes his own position. However, I find his juxtaposition of the limbic system and the higher cortical functions to be just another 'id vs ego'. Not very illuminating. We all know that humans differ from the apes in important ways. He takes too many words t say that. I would not buy this book again."
2,straightforward intro,"Read as part of barnes-noble online classes in human evolution. A good pick for an intro textbook on rise and evolution of us. Last chapter with required scientist speaks out on revelance of his work was the only chapter that i found myself skimming rather then reading. nothing spectacular or controversial, careful analysis with nicely written prose makes it a natural for a general text on the subject."
3,"Interesting, but too shallow and mediocre authorship","Ian Tattersall is a middle-of-the-road writer whose main fault is his failure to capture the public's imagination as Richard Leakey and Donald Johanson so skillfully accomplished. No doubt his book is geared for the beginner layman audience, with interesting and up-to-date facts, but for any individual who has prior experience concerning this topic, the book may prove a bit boring. If you're looking for a somewhat more in-depth and informative book, don't miss Tattersall's The Fossil Trail: How We Know What we Think We Know About Human Evolution. It has some very good pictures with good descriptions."
4,A great book to browse through,"It seemed to me that the authors had to strain some to make an entire book of this, but its subject certainly is a structure unbelievably rich in history. One can scarcely help but be moved to remember Byron's words in Childe Harold which end thusly:""Heroes have trod this spot--'tis on their dust we trod."""
4,An extraordinary everyday guide...,"I ordered this book because of George Zee's review, and he was right on target. I was looking for a short, concise, well written NLP book for everyday problems. Though not new to NLP, this book gave me new insight on how to apply it to my own life. This has been a problem for me in the past as I tend to view things as too much of a technical exercise at times. O'Connor's writing style is conversational, flows well and is simple to follow. I would recommend it to anyone, and will probably be ordering multiple copies for gifts this year."
5,Great Guide,"The authors have provided a wealth of information to assist the reader in experiencing the wonders of this beautiful state. Along with recommended trips for each month of the year, there is a trip locator map, state and government resources, Internet resources, recommended reading, best bets, and a terrific index. Each adventure has a wealth of information including a detailed map, food and lodging recommendations, how to have fun in that locale, things to bring with you, time you need for the adventure, and more."
5,Outstanding Reference,"I have used this book so often, that I gave copies away for Christmas presents and bought a spare for myself. The piece on HawkWatch led me to a week in the blind with the biologists that capture, record, band and release 60-90 raptors a day. It was outstanding!!!!"
3,Great formatter with poor font rendering.,"As a screenplay formatter Final Draft 7.0 works as well as its predecessors, but still has a rotten font rendering quality. I would have thought that this would the number one priority to attend to at this stage in Final Draft's development cycle.That gripe aside - and it's a really significant one - everything else works very smoothly.Because of this issue, I would recommend Screenwriter 2000, which does everything that Final Draft can do, and doesn't have any issue with its ability to render fonts cleanly. In addition, screenwriter 2000 has a more useful suite of associated products, notably: Dramatica 4 pro and Storyview 2. The tech backup is superior, too."
1,stick with version 6,"Unfortunately, in 'improving' its software, FINAL DRAFT has taken out its best features. One can no longer go from index card, or outline, directly to scene from Navigator. It has also crashed three times. Worthless, really. Bring back v.6 and dump this junk."
2,Doesn't Work Well With Vista,"I've had both Final Draft 5 & 6, but just bought a brand new laptop, so I figured I should probably upgrade. Bad idea...Long story short, I ended up uninstalling it and sending it back. For some reason, 6 works better.Oh, and forget about using Collabowriter on 7. I was told by their own tech people this is never going to work because of new security features built into the new operating systems."
4,Screenwriting mad easy,"Final Draft is a great piece of software which will make your screenwriting a lot easier. Very intuitive and straight forward. If you are serious about writing scripts, give into the industry standard and get Final Draft. The only comment I would have is that it looks a little retro for this day and age. They could work on the design a little. But this does not keep it from being a great program. You won't regret this purchase."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"This software is not worth the money you pay for it. It has a ridiculous and time consuming installation process which doesn't work on some systems and they do not bother to tell you this in advance. The company is unreliable and difficult to communicate with. They have now twice promised me update CDs to correct the problems with their software which have not arrived (the first time they promised me was about 8 months ago and the last being over 2 months ago.) Not all the features that are supposed to come with this software actually work.There are other programs for screenwriters out there. Save yourself the money, the time and the headache - try a different one."
3,"Useful, but flawed","Final Draft 7 is a nice piece of software. It is easy to use and it has a number of nice features (my favorite: assigning voices to characters and listening to the program read your script). This application really streamlines the process of writing a script, which is nice. You don't need to worry about wasting time formating. It's all automated.Now to the bad stuff. This program is riddled with bugs. It crashes very frequently. I can't tell you how annoying it is to be intensely involved with your work only to have Final Draft crash on you, destroying pages of unsaved work. If you get this program then you will find yourself in the habit of pressing ctrl+S (save) every few lines.Overall, Final Draft 7 is a useful, but flawed program. There's no denying its ease of use in crafting screenplays, but it can also be a major headache when it crashes."
2,Aren't Newer Versions Supposed To Be Better?,"I've been using Final Draft for a number of years now, back to version 4.X, and always liked it. Version 6 has been a real winner, with a few annoying quirks. When given an opportunity to upgrade to version 7, I thought, ""Great, I'll do it."" I'm sorry I did. FD7 may turn out to be a good update to a good program, but as it is now it shouldn't have been released. Just a couple examples -- when I switch to the index card view, I get a screen full of blank index cards, even though I'm many pages into my script. What gives? It's much less convenient to access Scene Navigator and Index Cards in FD7, and as another reviewer wrote, the Go To function doesn't work properly. What a disappointment. So now I'm back to using FD6, which is so much better. I'll be on the lookout for updates that might make FD7 at least usable, but until then I'll stick with FD6. You should do the same."
4,Final Draft saves time and trouble,"I am a beginning scriptwriter and I found the software easy to use, and undestandable - however, it does on occasion crash, so I put my automatic save at 3 minutes. Also, you have to think twice when saving, because the fdr files can only be edited in Final Draft, so you need to make a rich text backup as well. But, let me tell you if you are looking for a way to save time - this is the product you want to get"
2,Weird (on a PC anyway),I have a friend who uses the Mac version and swears by it. I purchased the PC version and it's certainly interesting. It behaves like no other text editor I've ever seen. Simple operations like cut and paste become strange exasperating games to see what text Final Draft will actually decide to let you cut and paste. I guess it's trying to keep script elements contiguous--but there are times when you just...want...to move...the damn...WORDS. Final Draft makes the mistake of assuming too much.Edit: I hereby redact the rest of my review. I still think the program could use some polish on a PC...but my previous ire was more from ignorance than the program itself. It ain't so bad.
4,Wish I had More Time,"From what I've seen of this product, it has everything that I need to write professional looking plays. I just need to find the time to explore all of the features...and to write in general. I've written one script, and re-formatted another using this program, and have been very impressed with how much time this program can save you once you know what you're doing."
1,A HORRID PIECE OF SOFTWARE!,"I've worked as a professional writer in Hollywood for a decade and Final Draft is the worst screenwriting program I've ever encountered. It's buggy, non-intuitive, clunky, slow, and supremely frustrating to use. I actively discourage writers I work with and hire from using it. How this became the ""industry standard"" is beyond me. Final Draft will kick-out a professional-looking script, but as far as actual ""writing"" Final Draft gets in the way of the process. If you like having to battle a program that's always trying to second guess you - then you may love it. But I certainly don't."
4,Good For What I've Done,"...and that's not saying much. This was bought under the recommendation of my brother (cinematographer) who uses it pretty regularly.I like it. It seems pretty straight forward once you use the help files for things you don't understand. But once I got past the little minor things, I was cranking out a screenplay in no time. I'm by no means a professional screen writer, but I really view this program as a means to and end; getting an idea down in a format. The rest is up to you."
1,this product is total garbage,"Final Draft is a totally inept program. Never has a product failed so completely. I have been a professional writer for eight years; I would rather use charcoal pencils and toilet paper to write my next screenplay. The mere fact that this sad joke of a product can be packaged and marketed is testament to the fact that there are so few competing screenwriting software programs out there and so they enjoy somewhat of a monopoly. I've just switched to Movie Magic and I'll report on that software shortly. If you're a self hater and like to waste countless hours trying in vain to retrieve lost writing, like a program that is counter intuitive and has none of the requisite functions that would even qualify it as a screenwriting program then this super turd is for you."
1,Seriously Buggy,"I've been using FD for years, and haven't had any serious problems, but this version is a disaster. I can only select text from bottom to top, and even that is totally unpredictable. The new version crashes endlessly if you have an older version installed, but uninstalling the previous version deletes the custom Final Draft fonts. Since the 'upgrade' to version seven I've spent more time wrestling the software than I have writing.The only new feature that interested me was the outline view, but in practise it's stupid. Most of the time it's impossible to navigate a script by sluglines alone, and the result is more wasted time.Steer clear of this product."
1,A disgrace,"As a now professional writer, Final Draft 4, 5 and 6 got me through the early screenplays, I have grown very fond of the program - my major ""work tool"".Final Draft 7 is a disgrace. Not only will you be wasting your money on an unusable product, you will spend hours of your time downloading and installing updates that fail, trying to optimise and ""learn"" a program that will let you down. I am actually amazed that a program that is so close to Version 6 (really, the only addition is the split screen thing...)is so far from that version in terms of stablity. What is up with this?We are talking about a program that is a BASIC word processor tailored to screen and stage writing - this isn't a complex 3d game!My strong advice is that if you feel you have to start with Final Draft, then purchace Version 6. (Still avalible - how many companies would keep an outdated version of their software on that market?) Otherwise look at the competitors."
3,Only TWO Computers can use it...,"This is THE SCREENWRITING program... its awesome... and Amazon is actually one of the cheapest places to find it (Retails $229) but even at Amazon's lower price its still too darn expensive... While I'm not admitting pirating software - FinalDraft as solved the problem - by charging a LARGE amount of money to get their serial code, which you MUST register online to unlock and use - and worst of all - You can only do it TWICE.So I was quite frustrated to shell out that large amount of cash - only to discover that I can't use this on my two home computers (my G4 Desktop and my MacBook Pro) in addition to my computer at work - I have to pick two computers to load it on.So bah humbug to you Final Draft 7 creators - it's a great program - but If we buy it - we should be able to load it on AT LEAST Three computers."
1,Another writer back to using V6,"The people at Final Draft really should have worked out all the bugs in Version 7.0 before releasing it to the public. I've used Final Draft for years and this new version is the first that has actually crashed my computer just trying to use it. Go To has problems, as does Index Cards, and even Spell Check doesn't perform properly for me. It doesn't even fix the spelling of the word after I've approved the change. Like the other writers here, I have returned to Version 6 until Final Draft gets the bugs out of this new version. So far, a complete waste of time and money. In this case, newer does not mean better. Stick with V6 if you want to get any work done!"
1,Second Thoughts,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I buy all of her books the second they hit the shelves but I don't think I will be doing that anymore. The book makes me have second thoughts about Nora being an ""automatic"" buy anymore. The book is mostly a prologue with only a few chapters in the here and now. The writing starts off pure Nora but by the end of the second chapter her J.D. Robb persona is front and center. If I want a violent book or a violent sexual book, I'll buy one. This books dark theme and poor interaction betweent the main characters was a huge dissapointment. From now on, I'll wait to read the review and for the paperback edition."
2,Too Graphic-Too Long to get somewhere,"This book was so different from the usual NR story. The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic. If you want romance, skip this. It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up."
2,hated it,"While the story is interesting, the hero and heroine don't meet until page 200. Also, the heroine is rather oblivious to the threat that has hung over her since age 11. A book of 400 pages with half of it the backstory, in order to get to the action, ugh! Hope her next offering is better. Even setting it in Baltimore didn't make thai a standout for me."
3,average Roberts,"This is typical fare of an author who is producing more books than she can really think through. Think Tommyknockers for Mr. King...The heroine is a good,strong character, but nothing new or intriguing that we haven't seen before. I was way disappointed that she didn't figure out the antagonist earlier than she did... and I thought so much more could have been done with that character. Instead, I found that his actions were evil for the sake of evil, without any real character development.It's a decent romance, but get it in paperback. Better yet, get it from the library next summer when you're at a loose end."
2,Blue Smoke,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, however, this book was graphicly violent and sadistic. This is not what I have come to expect from her and I was very disappointed. When I what a book like this I read Patricia Cornwell."
1,Don't read this one. There are better ones out there.,"I suppose I can't expect Roberts to blow me away with every book that she writes, especially since she is so prolific but I found this book to be such a let down that I was stunned. I have read many, many Nora Roberts books and I love her In Death series when she writes as JD Robb, but Blue Smoke just didn't work. The characters just weren't that developed or even likable and with the added cruelty and violence thrown in it just wasn't an enjoyable read. If you want to try a Nora Roberts book DO NOT BUY BLUE SMOKE. There are better ones out there."
3,My first Roberts novel,"I am a bit disappointed. My mom brought this book on a trip to Costa Rica and passed it to me after she finished it. I guess it was okay for a beach read but it was a bit thin on plot and thick on filler. I'd like to believe that all her books cannot be this thin because Roberts is such a huge author. I have one other of her books, Carolina Moon, that I will give a shot - I hope it's better. If you are a Roberts fan you might like this book. If you are like me and just starting out, I don't think this is the one to start with - I would stick with other, great romantic suspense authors like Tami Hoag, early Iris Johansen or Mary Higgins Clark."
4,Great Audio bood,I enjoyed this story very much and the convenience of listening as I went to and from work.
1,DO NOT Buy This BOOK-RAPE and SODOMY,"I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts and have read every single book that she has written. That is why I was so disturbed to read her lattest novel ""Blue Smoke"". It started out very different from her other novels and took me awaile to get into the novel. About half way through the novel things just went south and then got worse. For some reason Ms. Roberts thought it would add to the story to graphically describe a sean with rape and sodomy. Then the women is burned alive. It is just terrible and very disturbing. I actually threw the book away. DO not buy this book."
2,Blue Smoke,"I am usually sleepless in anticipation of the latest NR release, but I have to say, I wasted my nights waiting for this one. I would've enjoyed the story much more if it just dealt with a fire bug and his motivation without going into the gorey, gorey details. I wasn't sure I could finish it and had to keep putting it down for days before I could continue. If I want to be aware of senseless acts of violence, all I have to do is turn on the evening news. I read to escape hearing about all the awful things people do to each other. I don't want to have to pay for the privilege. To say I was disappointed, doesn't even come close.Shame on you, Nora! Bring back good, ol contemporary romance. I know you can do it.DA Texas"
3,Disappointed,"Not the quality writing the author has done recently. It took forever to get into the story, and the outcome was obvious from the start. While the central characters are interesting and fun, they have to be brighter than dipicted."
4,Fantastic Read!,"I picked this book up in the local library just for some fun reading and became a fan. Currently I have been in love with J.D Robb series with Eve Dallas. I figured I would give Nora a chance in winning me over with some romance. I loved this book! I loved how at the very beginning something exciting jumps out to keep you on your toes! The book follows Catarina Hale over twenty years of romance, hardship, and the love of a great family. I simply could not get away from this book for three days! Thanks Nora for keeping me entertained!"
4,Great Read,"I read this one in a day. I do agree that there were aspects of this book that were different than most of Nora Roberts' novels, but I didn't feel that it detracted from the story. Although the killer is a little bit obvious, so that was one drawback, but the sheer wit and intelligence of the characters makes this worth reading.There was voilence in this one, but the detail of the investigations and Reena's job was excellent. Unlike some writers, Nora Roberts strives to make realistic characters, whether they be a sociopath or a debutante, and continually shows that she puts plenty of research and effort into each book. For those who say there wasn't enough romance, I would say that it's just about right for a ""real life"" story. If you want more romance than anything else, pick up a Silhouette and call it a day."
2,Didn't like it much,"I agree with the other reviews about how slow the book was, how secondary the romance felt, and how annoying it was to know pretty much from page 1 who the bad guy was and then watch Reena take forever to figure it out. I read suspense thrillers pretty often and I'm not usually bothered by them. But there was one scene in this book that left me really shaken. It went on way, way, way, way too long and in too much detail. It was totally unnecessary, added nothing to the plot. And unfortunately that is what I will probably remember most about this book. :/"
2,Not a Very good COP,"The book had a good story line with good characters. A nice loud loving Italian family. The problem I had with this novel was huge neon arrows would have pointed to the suspect much earlier in the book. It was a shame to make the cops look so stupid, especially the main character."
2,Disappointed,"I am a long-time NR's fan, and I was very disappointed by this book. The ""mystery"" was a complete no-brainer, the main character is fairly fleshed out but does a few stupid things that left me shaking my head, the villain is sadistic and thoroughly unlikable so you can't even have fun rooting for him. The procedural aspects on fire investigation are somewhat interesting, and the protagonist's family members can be entertaining (if somewhat stereotypically ""Italian""), but on the whole I found this book predictable and unpleasant."
4,Crime story - romance,"Crime mystery / romance by the diva of this genre. Renna is from a close knit Italian-American family who own a pizzaria in a Baltimore neighborhood. Due to an arson fire at the restaurant when Renna was a child, she focuses her energy on studying to become an arson investigator. Through the years, there are other mysterious fires and the unsolved death of Renna's first love.Bo is a carpenter who had seen Renna several years before at a college party and considered her his ""dream girl"". Try as he may, he could never connect with her until many years later. The romance between Renna and Bo takes place during the increasingly blatant and more personal arson fires plaguing Renna.This is a pretty good and quick read that I enjoyed until the ending. After a fair amount of tension, the ending was a little rushed. The romance is a little predictable, but I would still have liked to see more of Renna and Bo."
2,Disbelief really hard to suspend!,"Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book. Believe me, it is not one of her best.I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long. It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable. How many boyfriends of one person can be killed? The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess."
4,Classic NR with a twist,"I have been a faithful NR fan for years and think I have read almost everything she has in print. Blue Smoke is consistent with previous NR books in that the characters are well developed, the dialoge is engaging and she weaves in the theme of family. The ""grisly"" details in this book is somewhat of a departure from her normal writing style, however, I did not feel it was too graphic, but rather added to the realism and depth of the book. I really enjoyed this book and it will go near the top of my all-time NR favorites."
3,Blue smoke,"I like liked this book pretty good but not as much as most of Nora Roberts other books. It wasn't as ""catching""."
5,Great book,Held my interest clear to the end. Good combination of romance and suspense. Did not want to put it down.
1,OOKKAAYY...,"Nora, Nora, Nora, what have you done!! I used to love reading your books, now I am scared to pick them up. If I wanted graphic detail I'd pick up a JD Robb book. Please keep the graphic, mystery to JD and keep the fun, light, romantic stories to Nora.If you like NORMAL NR books, do NOT read this one. If you are offended by graphic details of murder and other violent crimes, do NOT read this book. I was very disturbed after finishing this book. Plus you get 300 gabillion pages of build up for a 2 page boom...then...well that's the end of the book. All in all, don't buy this book."
4,Much Better Characters than Northern Lights,"This is the Nora we know and love. The woman was strong, smart AND feminine. The mystery was a bit predictable to the reader since the plot evolved over many years and clues discovered many years apart may not be as easy to link together for the characters as for us reading about them a few hours apart; you may, as I did, have to remind yourself of that fact a few times throughout the book. :)Overall satisfying book as it unites the things that made NR a top selling writer. Great family dynamics, a credible mystery, and a lovely romance."
1,Blue Smoke,"An avid Nora Roberts fan and devoted to J.D. Robb also, I have never been so appalled and repeled by any book! I am totally shocked that NR wrote this book!! I had to keep skipping so many passages that were nauseating with the graphic detailed acts of psyco-sadism and brutality that I (1) quit reading the book and (2) thanked God I had borrowed it from the library instead of my usual purchase of a NR book!! I had to give this book 1 star to post the review but I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy! Save your money."
2,If you can get past the contradiction...,"This book is about a very observant and perceptive child (Reena) who has a ""memory like a tape recorder"" for details and observation. She grows into an equally super-sharp adult with a passionate mission. Yet, though its blantantly obvious from the start of the book who the villain is, ""sharp-as-a-tack"" Reena never makes the connection. If you can get past this huge flaw, its not a bad story. The reason I gave this book any stars at all is because the other characters were real and endearing and the author captures the flavor of Baltimore's Little Italy beautifully. This book could have been great - I feel Nora dropped the ball on this one."
1,Blue Smoke,"I have all of Nora Roberts books and this is by far the worst of her books that I have read. It's more of a JD Robb book rather than a Nora Roberts book. We knew the bad guy from the first part of the story. There was no suspense, and the description was graphic. This is a very disappointing read for me."
4,GOOD READ!!,"Catarina Hale is living her dream. Ever since her family's restaurant was burned to the ground at the hand of an arsonist when she was a child, she has wanted to be an arson investigator. Now a well-respected member of the arson division of the Baltimore Police Department, Reena has it all but love. Every man that she has cared for has met an untimely demise.....and they have all involved fire in one way or another.Bo Goodnight has finally found his dream. Having spotted the gorgeous Catarina at a college party over a decade ago, he has been unable to get her off of his mind. But now she has moved into the house next store, and suddenly Bo is living his dream...Soon the phone calls begin...taunting, and eerie. And Reena knows without a doubt who is behind all of the fires, and all of the death...with hers being the ultimate act of revenge. But can Reena find this monster before he finds her?A true pageturner, with an unfortunately predictable bad guy.DYB"
2,Nasty,"Unnecessary gross disgusting violence, I could not bring myself to read all of it. I usually love Nora Roberts's books, but I threw this one away!"
3,Trish,"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and even her bad books are better then most but I was disappointed in Blue Smoke. I thought it started a little slow, not a lot of suspense and the ending disappointed me. Usually I can't put her books down and will read them in one or two days. Blue Smoke, five days."
3,Grisly,"If you are expecting a nice romantic suspense novel when you see Nora Roberts' name on the cover, then you are in for an unpleasant shock. This is a horror novel, and as such, it is quite well done, well written, and well plotted. Unfortunately, I don't knowingly read the horror genre, because graphic descriptions of women being tortured, raped, and burned to a crisp are simply not the way I care to spend my afternoons.If Roberts wanted to go into this genre -- and it is her prerogative to write whatever she wishes -- then it might have been better for her faithful readers if she had used a pseudonym, so that they are not misled into thinking they are buying one kind of novel, when in fact, they are buying something quite different indeed.So I averaged my rating for this book: five stars, certainly, for the quality of the writing, the characterizations, and the storytelling; but one star because as a reader, I felt a little deceived about what type of book I was getting."
3,Reviewed but not spoiled,"First, I adore Nora Roberts. Will Blue Smoke be one of my favorites? No. However, as usual with her writings, I was taken on a journey. She created a world, populated it, and told me a story. I love it when she does that for me.Now the issue of violence is discussed in many reviews. Blue Smoke did bring a level of darkness that we are more use to in the 'In Death"" series and I did finder it harder to deal with in this book.I believe that it is probably because the resolution, the justice, came so quickly at the end we didn't have many pages with the survivors to be able to close the book, walk away and know that, with time, they would be ok. I was unsettled. But I think that being unsure that things will get better is not out of place in society today.So if you love Nora Roberts, you will find many things to love in this book."
2,Can I have my money back please?,"This story earns 2 stars only because of that part that still belongs to the Nora Roberts I have always enjoyed - a warm romantic relationship with appealing secondary characters. Sadly what remains stuck in my head are the repeated graphic and gratuitous violence that is *not* what I bought NR for! In my view there was no reason for the detail; the pyro's character had already been effectively brought to life for me long before. Shame on you, Ms R, for disappointing so many fans. I don't buy your books for that sort of experience.A secondary criticism (though I can appreciate an author trying out new techniques) is the long stretch before we get to have Beau and Reina meet. What causes so many NR stories to sparkle is the interaction between the main characters, and in this case the story was treading water for a very long time before it got really interesting.As another reviewer has stated, this is a NR book that I will never read again."
2,Fire Novel Not So Hot,"With apologies to Nora Roberts, normally one of my favorite authors, this was not a great book by any means. Long, over-written and pedantic, I just couldn't enjoy it. I kept waiting for the book to get started, move along, or just get out of the way. Please don't judge the author by this book. Pick another one and just pretend this one didn't ever go to press."
2,Why so violent?,"I usually love Nora Roberts and wait impatiently for her new arrivals but this books was a major disappointment. It is strangely violent - violence that seems unnecessary to the plot and takes the reader too much away from the story. I truthfully don't have a problem with murder, mayhem, etc. but it has to fit the tone of the book and this story tries to be two different things - a shocking, slasher style book and a warm, once-in-a-lifetime romance that don't fit well together...at all. I got the book from the library and am glad that I did not pay for it. I do not recommend this book to Nora Roberts fans - it may be more for her J.D. Robb following."
2,"Wrong ""author""","Like other reviewers of this title, I try to read all of Nora Robert's books, including the J.D. Robb series. I have certain expectations for books written under the very different styles of each of these ""authors"" and this book was too much of one and not enough of the other. The graphic detail and disturbing window into the evil mind of the villain is expected from ""J.D.""; warm families, sexy romance, gentle humor, and strong secondary characters---trademarks of ""Nora's"" books---are welcomed as comfortable contrasts to the horrifying suspense of Eve Dallas's future world. I enjoy both styles, but I am more prepared for the lingering darkness created by exposure to the evil mind of a socio-path if I know that's I'm getting. It was hard to finish the book, and after reading the graphically violent scenarios crammed into the last 20-30 pages, I am almost sorry I did."
2,I agree with some of the other reviewers,"I'm a Roberts fan, I've read/and own almost all of her books. This was a serious disappointment. Too slow, too obvious and too annoying. There wasn't one character I was interested in,(except Gina). NOt one of her best."
2,Suspense? Not in this book........,"This could possibly be the most predictable book I have ever read. Upon finishing the novel I'm left wondering if Roberts expected us to know who the arsonist was from the first chapter. You have to be brain-dead not to. Which leads me to another complaint ~ why didn't Reena pick up on the obvious clues? She was supposedly gifted in her abilities as a fire investigator.The romance aspect of the novel was luke-warm at best, but the only thing that kept me turning the pages.This was my first Nora Roberts novel and I was not impressed."
2,Dont Get Me Wrong,"Dont get me wrong, i like nora roberts. I just hate the fact that her female protaganists turn from smart independent women into blubbering idiots, who cant think of anything but sex and the man they ""love"" and cant make any decisions for themselves.This book is the same thing. Its a good book, but the female turns into an idiot when she meets the guy.so yeah read the book, but bewarned..."
3,BLUE SMOKE,"FIRST OF ALL, I ADORE NORA ROBERTS, BUT THERE IS NO SUSPENSE IN THIS BOOK. YOU KNOW GOING IN WHO THE ANTAGONIST IS- I EVEN SKIPPED TO THE END HOPING THERE WAS A TWIST- BUT NO, ITS SO OBVIOUS. THAT SPOILED THE SUSPENSE FOR ME, AND I DIDNT LIKE HER SNOOTY SISTER, BUT STILL ANY NORA BOOK IS A GOOD BOOK. MY OTHER GRIPE IS, WHY MUST EVERYONE BE SO BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND FILTHY RICH? DONT POOR NOT-SO ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE FALL MADLY IN LOVE TOO?"
4,Narrator needs to bone up on her Baltimore pronunciation...,"Great story!! Excellent in fact. My beef is with the narrator and editor:As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references. However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards. For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g! It is Boo-g... Do better research!!!"
5,Not to mislead others,"I began reading Nora Roberts when I was 16. I love her. This book was no more graphic then Brazen Virtue (1988). The book kept you guessing, because this is the first book I've read by her that was excatly who you thought it was. But I ended talking myself out of believing who it was. SO I am sorry a few may think this book was too graphic, but go back a read a few of her other books like Sacred Sins (1987)and Brazen Virtue (1988). Then compare it it this. It is about the same amount of graphic content. Just read the book. It's great, and you fall in love with Renna and Bo and the array of characters."
4,Blue Smoke by Nora Roberts,Great who doneit.Keeps you guessing till the end.Did not want to put it down
5,Another Great One!,"I found this story riveting. Not to go into any detail - plenty of other reviews - You definitely find nothing to like about the bad guys. I found the research on arson very informative without being boring. Face it - Nora knows how to tell a story and keep you page turning. The family interaction is wonderful, I love close knit families. Not every story has to follow a formula. If that's what you are looking for (a formula romance) stick to the 124 page novellas available in every grocery store check out lane."
2,Oops my bad,"Really thought this was going to be enjoyable since I have read previous titles by this author and loved them. I just didn't get this one. It seemed to me as though the main character might be just about as deranged as the killer and I just didn't get that happy feeling of wanting to root for the success of anyone in this book. I almost think in some way I liked the killer better than the hero and heroine because at least that character was designed to make the reader feel revolted and actually completed the mission. I didn't absolutely hate it, but I found it kind of long winded and disappointing. Not the best Nora Roberts out there. I wouldn't recommend making this the first Nora Roberts title you read if you are new to her work."
1,Disappointed,"I unfortunately ordered this DVD without reading the write-up on it thoroughly. I was unable to play it on our US DVD player and ended up sending it back. I would have loved to have seen the movie. My husband is Greek and is actually IN the movie as a little boy! His Mom served Sophia Loren coffee in the taverna while the actress was on the island of Hydra to film the movie. Oh, well."
2,squishy,"I bought these today at a local outdoor store because I needed some new water shoes for paddleboarding. They looked good,appeared well made, but not too fancy, and the price was right. After wearing them today while paddleboarding I think they mis-named the shoes, a more fitting name would be NRS ""water balloons"" because thats what it feels like your wearing on your feet once they get wet. The drainage is very poor due to the high wall construction around most of the shoe and to make matters worse, for some reason a thick innersole was used as you might find in a regular tennis shoe, which contributes to the waterlogged squishy feel. Not recommended"
5,Finally: Strange Affair on c.d.!,"As is the case with the twofer containing Beware of the Shadow and their first album, you get a lot of excellent music in this neatly packaged two disc set. Musically reminiscent of a blend of the acoustic parts of Led Zep's third album and the Grateful Dead style on American Beauty and Workingman's Dead. Strange Affair is one of the greatest recordings of the early 70's. Unfortunately few heard the band or the lp. This album was played quite bit on the great old FM100 in Memphis which at the time was still ""underground"".The second cd (Return of Ken Whaley lp plus the Happy Days ep) is good but it's the Strange Affair album that's stayed with me for over 30 years. I would go so far as to say that the instrumental called ""The All Electric Fur Trapper"" ranks up there with Pink Floyd's ""Great Gig in the Sky"" for best rock instrumental of all time. Excellent liner notes too--"
1,Avoid unless you have nothing better to do...,"What crap!!! I am not a hyper-critical person so when I tell you this is worthless I'm not feeding my ego. What is deemed to be a ""Label Assistant"" is useless - if I can't figure out how to print out a simple page of labels immediately - the full page, not just the ""active"" label (in my case Avery 5164), then how am I being ""assisted"". Granted, this is a very low price item, but in this case you do indeed get what you pay for. Unfortunately, it seems all label software is this clueless - at least this crap was cheap."
4,moto krzr extended battery.,"my brothers old battery sucked bad it would only last for 2 mins and cut off the only way he could use his phone pulled up to the charger so i ordered him this one. I have to say shipping was fast, the battery also comes with a back, with the extended battery it does make the back a little bit thicker but it doesn't look bad as most of the phone.. his battery lasts maybe 2 days. usually they surposed to last longer but for the moneys worth it's still a good battery, so i would recommend you this product if your looking for a motor krzr battery :)."
1,caveat emptor,"I purchased this product in april 2012,here it is august 2012.This battery has completely stopped charging,so much for this being a new item.Buyer beware...."
1,Motorola Li-Ion Extended Battery and Door for Motorola KRZR (Dark Pearl Gray),I ordered this product from OEM. I never recieved the product I ordered. OEM did try and make this right by convincing me to take my review down and sending me out another back to the battery. But they sent me out the exact same back that went to a NEXTEL phone not a KRZR. I still have not recieved the correct back and have no way to use a battery with no back that fits. I have no idea how the battery works or doesn't work. I would NEVER order from OEM and if you do and they screw up your order don't take down your review until you actually have the correct item in hand. In my opinion OEM is a joke.
2,6 months later - it doesn't hold a charge,"I bought two of these batteries - one for me; one for my wife. Six months later my wife's is working well and holding a charge. Mine is not. New, the charge would last 2-3 days w/o requiring a recharge. Now, i'm forced to charge it daily."
4,As advertised,"Holds a charge for a little more than 2x as long in my KRZR, as compared to the standard battery. The KRZR is still a battery pig, so that's only 3-4 days, but that's not the battery's fault. Yes, it's a little thicker, but it still fits easily in my pocket."
2,Motorola Battery,"FALSE ADVERTISING. I should have known the price was too good to be true. The add stated this was a NEW oem replacement battery. It is an oem replacement, but this battery is NOT NEW. It last half as long as it should and you can see the wear marks on the battery."
2,"One worked well, the other as ran-down as my old battery.",We ordered two of these batteries. One is working very well & apparently must have been new. The other is as weak as my old battery & dies within a day or two when I don't even talk on the phone. So really a mixed bag.
4,Extra long life,"Lasts so much longer than the original. I have been charging this battery like once every week. Hopefully it lasts longer than the 7-months my original ""skinny"" battery did."
4,The Unwritten Rule of Highly Effective Job Search,A good source to use along with an accountability group. Both are important tools to minimize your job search time.
3,Worth the read,"I will be honest, this book has inspired me to get take some initiative in my job search! If you are looking to take that extra step into the job market, this book is a great starting place! It provides real world examples that any individual can use to improve his likeliness of finding a jobIn a struggling economy like this one, finding a job can be a daunting task. As an IT professional, I have had recent success and would highly recommend using http://www.hound.com to search for jobs. Hound lists its jobs strictly from employer websites, and has FAR more jobs than many other job boards. Hound is a great resource to get your feet back into the working world!"
5,The system in this book really works!,"I bought this book in May as I was finishing up the coursework towards my MA. I knew I would need to find a new job, but since I was changing career fields, I realized that I might need a different approach than before to find one.I read the book and the system outlined made intuitive sense to me. I also really identified with the emotional quality of the book. Although the system in this book is not easy, it is very effective. I have found the job I was searching for and it is a perfect match for my skills and education. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for not just their next job, but for the job of their dreams."
5,Great coaching for job seekers!,"Orville's work is straightforward, full of wisdom and good information for those who need to network but are unsure about what the process is and how to conduct themselves. The book demystifies networking, makes it real and very doable. I highly recommend his work; Orville is expert in the career field and he reaches a broad audience effectively."
5,A must read for all job hunters,"With so many job hunting books focused on things that don't matter like Resume writing and Cover letting writing. It was nice to read a book that was focused on what really matters, getting to the hiring manager before he needs to hire somebody. If you follow the process in this book you will find a job.Chris Pires - Author of ""Shred Your Resume and Find a job""Shred Your Resume and Find a Job"
5,Great Job Search Book,"I have to tell you this book is outstanding. It was both very informative and entertaining. Searching for a job is never fun. And if you're fortunate, you'll never have to search for many jobs in your life. If you're not experienced at looking for work, the search process can be arduous at best. This book provides a structure/methodology by which to conduct a highly effective job search and helps ease the ""pain"" of looking for work. I would recommend it to anyone from a new college grad to an experienced executive."
4,BEST,The best eyemakeup remover ever. I no longer use another product. However it is expensive and you can't reach the bottom %15 of it. I tried to break the pump the use what is left in the bottle but no way to break the bottle and reach it.
4,Contemporary horror/supernatural thriller set at U. of Wash.,"University of Washington Professor Veronica Glass takes in a troubled renter and a mixed up teenage girl. What results surprises everyone, as secrets and histories collide."
2,Nothing for Condos,"Although I knew this book was written for rental property management and not condos, I hoped it would have at least a couple chapters of overlap that condo property managers could use. Even though I have not been a condo property manager (I rented property in the past), I got nothing out of this book. The author of this book took the title too seriously. It seems written for people who have no understanding of rental property management in this country. Take a close look at the table of contents before getting this book. I just ordered Be A Successful Property Manager by Woodson, Roger."
3,"Read it, didn't do it","We were looking at the possibility of purchasing a rental home for the first time. I felt this gave us quite a bit of very useful information & was easy to understand. However, we did not end up with the rental home we thought. We did not realize that an insurance coverage on a rental property built in 1950 would be so much! However, we fould out the hard way that the plumbing & electricity must have documentation saying they have been updated & when. It also helps to have a brick home over a woodframe. There were only 2 companies out of about 20 that we called who would even consider insuring the home & at that they wanted about twice as much as I pay on my homestead. The book didn't warn us about that, but was pretty good in describing the laws & procedures involved in purchasing, maintaining, and renting a property."
3,MERSEY beat???,"A brief note to Jay Kuczma: Please don't call the Moodies ""Merseybeat""! They (like me) are proud Brummies - i.e. natives of Birmingham, NOT Liverpool! That's like calling the Velvet Underground a ""West Coast"" band! That aside, I agree with the comments on the CD."
4,Early Denny Laine!,"The early Moody Blues, with Denny Laine (of WINGS) were an R&B group whose sound was vastly different to what they became after he departed. This CD contains their only album, THE MAGNIFICENT MOODIES, in its entirety, plus the ""A"" & ""B"" sides of their first 4 singles. The mono mix here is a VAST improvement over the previous ""electronic stereo"" LP where I first heard some of these songs! (Early US Rolling Stones albums had the same problem.) Only ""Go Now"" sounds ""off""-- ironic, as out of the 25 songs they recorded together, it was the ONLY ""hit"". THIS new reissue (on Repertoire) is strangely missing their last 3 singles... WHY? (I'd have given this 5 stars if it was complete like the earlier London CD.) My faves include ""Something You Got"", ""I've Got A Dream"", ""It Ain't Necessarily So"", ""It's Easy Child"", ""From The Bottom Of My Heart"", and especially ""Steal Your Heart Away""-- their very first single, and one of my all-time favorite Denny Laine songs!"
1,Horrible,"I quess this is great for historic significance but the sound quality and music, for that matter, is horrible."
2,Who were the Moody Blues?,"Just as there were two Small Faces. Marriot v Stewert, there were two Moody Blues, pre and post Laine.For me, Go Now remains one of the most enduring songs from the 1960s. The rest of the songs more or less can be found on any eary Stone,Beatles, Kinks,Who, Rolling Stones album.I would have loved to see the early Moody Blues evolve as the above mentioned bands did. But it did'nt happen.The second Moody Blues were the pot smoking LSD type songs Nights in White Satin, Timothy Leary's Dead. Brilliant? Personally I could tell them where they could ride their seewaw!Unless you are a big fan of early English R&B; or this is the only way to get your hands on Go Now, I would pass."
5,a different Moody Blues,"This is the first music from The Moody Blues, and although the more known version of the Moody Blues with Justin Heyward & Co were big, when you listen to this CD you'd have hoped they had more material with this lineup. Denny Laine, the original Moody's lead singer lead this early phase of the Moody's, and it's no wonder Paul McCartney grabbed him later when he formed his post Beatles band, Wings. Denny had 10 great years with Paul & Wings, and this set is filled with great songs, and a great sound that was the mid 60's. The classic, Go Now, andI'll Go Craazy set you off into a world of great songs that the early Moody's always had."
3,A Different Moody,"To start with, ""Go Now"" is one of my favorite songs of all time by the Moody Blues or anybody. The rest of this album is pretty much a mixed bag & there really is nothing to recommend it to fans of the later mk 2 Moodies other than to complete your collection. None of the songs have the power of ""Go Now"" with most of them slipping into the standard white boys try to play soul. Not that they are bad but none of them are anywhere near as good as the real american black soul records of the time. In England most of soul was unknown but in the USA we heard daily on the radio Aretha, Wilson Picket, Otis Redding, Sam Cooke etc & this music is weak by comparison. Still all in all I do like this album but I don't know how I'd feek about it if I hadn't already head this before ""Days Of Future Passed""."
2,Encyclopedia,"This book has two major flaws:1. Far too many low-quality pictures are crammed into the pages2. The history is biased toward the success of the IH brand, and the story conveniently ends in 1980. Because of the encyclopedic nature, the history is linear at the beginning, and then all over the place as it gets into products.Would have been better served to eliminate tons of the photos and utilize that space for the development of unbiased historical explanation of the development of the company."
3,"Very ""heady"" addition to ACIM","For our study group this book ended up being too ""heady"" or almost professorial. Ken Wapnick has an amazing grasp of ACIM, but we found this book to be, well, too complicated and confusing. We thought we might find some clearer explanations like others we've seen or heard from Wapnick."
1,Bad Book,"I was required to read this book for my history class. It was probably the most boring book that I have ever read. Every time I started to read it I would fall asleep. I tried to read a chapter each day, but I ended up reading a page or two then passing out. The book goes too far into specifics and numbers in certain areas of his life which takes away from the story. This made the book almost unbearable to read. If you are having trouble sleeping at night then you should go out and buy this book, but if you are looking for a good read, think again."
1,boring book,"Andrew Carnegie was such a boring book, especially if you hate history. I couldn't get interested in it. It went too much in depth with numbers and statistics. Those things took away from what,I think, the author was trying to get the readers to understand.Every time I read it I would lose interest right away!! One paragraph and I was gone. I would even fall asleep when reading it!!! I had to re-read sections multiple times because I couldn't even tell you what I was reading. It went in one ear and out the other. I had to make sure I understood it though because I had to write a 5 page paper on it for my history class."
1,BORING,"I too had to read this horrible waste of a tree for my history class - i thought it was and intresting story the whole rags to riches thing but i never finished a single chapter because i didnt have the will power to push through the dryness of this book, most often i even fell asleep. livesay may have acuratley described the rise of andrew carnegie but this book is crap - only a true history nut would find any enjoyment in the book, and thats pushing it"
3,"Had to read for a class, but could've been worse","Normally, I don't really get into reading books for classes, I just get on with them and that's that. I'd like to say this book was different, but I can't go that far. It was slow in the start from his beginnings, but towards the end it offers some good business advice and some of the strategies he used to make it big during his time period of an evolving society and America. Not a bad read if you care about other people's entire life story, but since I can say that I don't, it was just OK. I wouldn't have picked up the book if I didn't HAVE to, and I'll leave it at that. Not a bad read, but not great either."
5,strong women and hot love,"these women are strong and powerful and the love is pure and wonderful, you can't beat it"
5,Great service!,"Not only came super fast, it also was in perfect condition, and the best part was the super bargain price!Thanks"
2,good potential,"This is my first review on amazon and my first book by Ms. Jones. I found the Sun Witch to be well written, and the idea of the three sister witches under a family curse very intriguing and plan on reading the rest of the series to see how it plays out. My reason for giving this book only 2 stars is because I just could not like Sophie and Kane. I just did not believe them to be realistic characters and found her transformation from doubting-witch to all-powerful witch to be rushed and rather unbelieveable, and the love between Kane and Sophie to be much to superficial and unrealistic. I'm going to get these books from the library rather than buy the rest of the series."
4,"Loved the Main Characters, But ...","I just finished all 3 book in this series (with this being the first). The stories were well-written and hard to put down. The main characters -- all very interesting. My objection is to the secondary characters which had a tragic plotline running through all three books. The ending was so sad - do not think of this as a typical happy ending type book for the secondary characters, anyway."
4,Very Fun,"If you don't mind Spongebob then you'll like this product. I thought it was fun, and there were different typing games that were easy to figure out and I thought it was a little entertaining too as long as Spongebob doesn't annoy you it's the funnest way I have found to practice typing."
3,Entertaining but not for kids...,"Ordered this for my 8 year old twins and it was a little too difficult. I had no problem with it and it has helped my speed, but it was very frustrating for them. I will give it another try in a year or so, maybe they'll be ready then."
1,Imposible to install on my windows xp,dido title - perhaps we will try on a macintosh and see if it works there
3,JUST AMAZING,This book was simply superb I must admit in the begining it was a bit duzzy but when one little juicy paragraph came up the whole book was just amazing. I defantly recamend this book to readers to teens such as myself...
4,Cute boots tad uncomfortable,I like these boots a lot. I have a high arch and usually wear flats so I would expect any shoes with a heel would be uncomfortable. They are exactly what I hoped they would be when I ordered them.
1,SMALLER SIZES,"When will there be smaller sizes of these shoes available? i need 8.5 :( i've been looking for them all over and there's no sizes :( somebody can please help me telling me where can i get these shoes but 8.5 size?? i will apreciate it very much, thx =)"
1,The Italia was a Training Flat (3 stars),"Description correction: it was not specifically for indoor.Before it became a casual favorite, the original Italia was the state-of-the-art Training (outdoor distance running) shoe in the sixties, before Onitsuka Tiger and Nike shoes challenged it.This was when there were only 3 categories of running shoes: Training - Racing - Spikes.The outsole of the Italia was thick green crepe.White upper with green stripes.It resembled the Country II, but lower to the ground.Kihachiro Onitsuka died on Saturday September 29 2007. He was 89."
4,comfortable shoe mainly for walking,I like the design simplicity of this shoe but don't use it for jogging or running as you will feel uncomfortable. I guess it is made for walking.
5,"Good book, confused about the price.","Great book - lots of wonderful ideas for working with 2 year olds and even developing a classroom/daycare if that's what you'd like to do. As a stay at home mother we will be using this as a way to incorporate learning experiences that my son would otherwise miss out on as he's not at preschool or daycare. My only complaint is with Amazon - I purchased the book for just over $18 brand new FROM Amazon and within three days they nearly doubled the price, which to me is simply obnoxious price-gouging."
4,Very happy with this book.,This book has been very helpful to me as a daycare teacher and director. I have been looking for it for many years and am happy to have found it at Amazon.com.
2,'Twas only a payday for Widmark.,"In this work filmed entirely in Israel, Richard Widmark gamely portrays Sam Lucas, a ""retired"" CIA operative who discovers that he is involuntarily back in action due to the sudden urging of his former initiate Gabriel Lee (Oliver Reed) who has been turned by the Soviet Union and now wants to come back into the American fold, not realizing that both players in the game have sent assassins to Israel to eliminate him, and Lucas as well. The direction is flabby with undue emphasis being placed upon silly and, naturally, superfluous stunts and car chases, with an inappropriate free hand being given to Gayle Hunnicut, playing the wife of Lucas and former lover of Lee, whose melodramatism proves distortive for what should be the critical scenes in this leaden affair, while the pudgy Englishman Reed, ill-advised to strip to the waist, has his lines dubbed in order to present an acceptable American accent."
4,"PETER COLLINSON, OPUS 14","***1/2 1976. Israeli co-production directed by Peter Collinson. The CIA and the KGB decide to eliminate Gabriel Lee, a spy currently working for the Russians. Lee finds refuge at Sam Lucas's home. Sam is a former CIA agent who retired a few years before. If you like spy thrillers on location, check this one. The film is not a masterpiece but is still watchable although the copy presented by Westgate is far from being perfect (VHS quality, no more). In fact, I really appreciate the mood of the American spy thrillers of the late 60's and the 70's. There are always car chases and explosions with a cool jazz-pop musical score easily recognizable. I also liked, in the SELL OUT, the streets of the old Jerusalem (empty most of the time because of the shooting) and the performance of Oliver Reed. Recommended."
3,Poor Worked Out Examples,"I am using Tipler's Physics for Scientists and Engineers in my AP Physics class this year. It is, in my view, a good book for the introductory physics course. However, it is definitely not a good book for people who wishes to have an in-depth understanding of the physical principles and to improve their problem-solving skills. Examples are not typical, questions at the end of the chapters always involve information not provided in the chapters."
5,I LOVE this record!,"Okay, so I'm listening to the mp3 version of ""Little Bit of Emotion"" as I write this... I never had the vinyl record, but I did own the 8-track tape when it first came out. I was familiar with some of The Kinks' work such as ""You Really Got Me,"" but not a huge fan. However, I absolutely LOVED this album! One reviewer wrote a thorough review, so anything I write would absolutely pale in comparison; I'm just sharing my enthusiasm for this gem, one of the most important records of my youth and now, rediscovered and cherished all over again."
4,Best of their arena rock albums...,"This was The Kinks best selling album in America and I think this is the best of their arena rock albums. Released in 1978, this was eaten up by the audience that wasn't rebellious enough for punk or trendy enough for disco. It sounded great at the time and still sounds pretty good but the production, power chords and lyrics are very dated. This is a perfect time capsule of it's time with numerous references to gas lines and double-digit inflation.Just like The Stones and Rod Stewart, The Kinks hit the discos with ""Superman"". And the next time you listen to ""Pressure"" think The Fools. You can't tell them apart on this song. The only two songs that are not very dated are the bluesy ""Gallon of Gas"" and the acoustic ""Little Bit of Emotion"". This CD has been digitally remastered with 3 alternative versions and informative liner notes. 5 stars in its day but it's lucky to get 4 today."
1,Why didn't they break up first?,"Terrible, just terrible. This is where they went from mediocre to embarrassing. Despite a handful of good songs in the '80s, this is where the whole Kinks thing ends. They could have saved face by disbanding after ""Misfits,"" but instead they had to make this audience-pandering, heavy metal-courting LP instead. Sure, they won a new audience of pot-smoking, cigarette lighter-waving teenagers with this album, but chased off the rest of us. A shame..."
3,Not What I Expected,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. It arrived on time and in great condition, however the product is not what I expected. It is just described as a pool rack sign and when I got it it is described as a table sign. We don't have any tables in our game room (right now anyway). I would have never ordered it if I had known that. Also, I thought that the balls lit up, but it is just a cardboard cutout with pictures of the balls with the neon light around it. My husband did decide to keep it, for when we do get a table. I would have rather gotten a sign to hang on the wall (which I thought this was)."
2,Does not fit 2000 Subaru Impreza Wagon,"Don't let Amazon's part finder fool you. This product will not fit into a stock 2000 Subaru Impreza wagon. It is way too small. I had to walk a ways to the auto parts store to replace this as I had my car apart when I was installing this filter. Really disappointed with Amazon for car part purchases. 2 out of 3 things did not fit when their part finder said it did.This 2 star review is not an indicator of the quality of the product. Product appeared to be of high quality. Make sure you read up on how to properly clean and oil the filters. You can gum up your mass airflow sensor if you screw it up, which is not a cheap fix (buy some $5-7 MAF safe cleaner just to be on the safe side...it is cheaper than paying someone $200 to ""fix"" it)."
1,misleading price,"the illustration and description state ""24 oz"" yet they shipped a 13oz can about half of what was advertised - very dishonnest and misleading"
5,"Wildly original music, wildly virtuosic performance","There are at least two other recordings of 'The People United', one by the composer, one by the treasurable Ursula Oppens. Hamelin has his own thoughts on this breathtaking set of variations and is at the very least competitive with the others. In some respects it outshines them because of his superior technique. Rzewsi's version is a bit grungier; Oppens is a bit more cautious. Hamelin's brings out all the elements in his typical clean but singing manner. These are also the best recordings of the other two pieces."
2,"""Frippertronics"" doesn't make it as a stand-alone music!","Call me narrow-minded--hell, I don't like Ornette Coleman's ""free jazz"" either. But I think the best place for Fripp's tape loop droning is as part of a structure involving a broader layout of instrumentation (as he himself does on ""God Save The King""). To give you an idea what it sounds like, it's used as a prelude and postlude to Peter Gabriel's ""Here Comes the Flood"" on his first solo album, under the rather descriptive title ""Water Music"". The best presentation of it, though, is in David Sylvian's ""River Man"" from his ""Gone To Earth"" album. This album, though, is for the serious fan of ambient music."
4,Misleading,"I bought this book for a Christmas gift for a 2 year old. I am sure he will love it, but I was a bit disappointed. Maybe I am naive, but I thought there was actually felt in the book. It is simply pictures of felt designs. It is a nice sturdy board book with a laminate coating, so I am sure it will last for a long time."
2,Thought this was DVD,"Unfortunately, I believed I was buying the DVD in which the actual performance was filmed. I was very disappointed to see that I got a CD. I purchased it at the same time I got approximately 8 other DVDs. The music is fine, but I wanted the music and the performance. So it did not meet my expectations."
4,Almost perfect,"Great ring, looks great and my girlfriend loves it, the only problem is with the 14K gold, it's a little bit weak and has caused the band to bend a little bit in a location, maybe try switching to 10k gold for a little more strength. Other than that, it's perfect."
5,good,"i bought this dog sign last year, and the color has not faded or started to crack. it with held some intense heat and cold. great, easy to see sign!"
1,Can't get it to work,I can't get this product to install on my 5 month old computerIt wants me to unstall my quicktime 6.3 and let it install quicktime 5 or 4 or something. I thought I did but maybe my computer has quicktime somewhere where I can't get rid of it even though it said it was uninstalled. I still get the same message and I never get to even see this Data becker program.I really hate products that ask you to get rid of a higher version of the program to let them install a lower one. Whatabout my other applications?I wrote customer service tech support on this just now and am waiting for an answer. I didn't see anything about needing a particular version of quicktime on the outside of the box or I wouldn't have bought it. Obviously this is a concern since this problem is on their FAQ as number 2. There is money down the drain.
5,Great!,"I love The 69 Eyes, they are one of my favorite bands.Savage Garden would have to in my opinion be their best album, Great for fans of Glam & Old School Rock.I was incredibly happy with my purchase :)"
1,DO NOT BUY!!! STAY AWAY!!!,I was surprised by this album. If you enjoy the gothic atmosphere that the 69 eyes brings then this album isn't for you. It was heavily rock blues influenced like a bad 80's tribute. It was too bright. I didn't even recognize that band members and the song titles hinted at the music genre. I hesitated buying this album but I put my faith in it. Faith never works for me.
5,Relaxing & stimulating;simple & complex;4 novices & experts,"Outback's first CD Baka was pretty good, but Dance the Devil Away outshines it brilliantly. There is a lot of variety on this one, from melancholy melodies to buoyant rhythms. Cradick is truly a skilled guitarist and musician (even if he does play an Ovation), as is Graham on the didgeridoo and LeMercier on the violin. The great mixture of instruments works very well, creating an original sound. Definitely a great investment. If it was a choice between Baka and Dance the Devil Away, I'd get Dance the Devil Away."
3,Average debut,"We must all start at the bottom. This phrase holds true for this debut album from Def Leppard. Though there are a few hard rockin' tracks, altogether the album's sound and make are totally...not too good. But if you're a true fan, you better have this one."
5,Excellent debut,"This is a great debut from one of the 80's best bands and one the best hard rock bands ever and still going. This is full of fist pumping, foot stomping good tunes. ""Overture, Hello America, Rock Brigade..."" are all very good rock tunes. Good transition from the 70's into the 80's. Great debut, classic rock album. Give it a listen."
3,Raw Leppard,"A much rawer Def Leppard than found on later albums, though it suffers somewhat from poor production and vocals that generally miss the mark."
3,A Good Start,"This has never been one of my top favorites, but it was a good start for Def Leppard. A good album for 1980. It got them off the ground and quality songs like ""Rock Brigade"", ""Hello America"" and ""Wasted"" demonstrated the bands potential and hinted of great things to come in the future. Recommended for diehard fans."
3,Very early leppard,This is a great debut for the band. Quite different from today's standards. A bit more on the NWOBHM like Iron Maiden. Check out This Leppard Classic before they made millions
5,Def Leppard's Hardest Rocking Album Ever,"ON THROUGH THE NIGHT captures Def Leppard at a time when all they wanted to do was rock, rock, rock. Just because their trademark big production is absent doesn't stop it from being a great recording of a hot young band really giving it all they've got. This is easily as good as any of their next four albums."
5,Leppard FOREVER,"Let's get serious. If Def Leppard sounded the same on the first album and their latest, that would be like saying that after 20 years U2 or Metallica should have the same sound. Artists CHANGE with time. Def Leppard is no different. I almost threw up the first time I heard the song 'Love Bites' off Hysteria, then I realized that the mighty Lepps were changing with the times. 'Lemon' by U2 was a [dumb]song the first time I heard it too, as well as 'Unforgiven' by Metallica. I have a new respect for bands like Def Leppard, U2, and Metallica for having the balls to change their sound. Good job and forever live Def Leppard!!"
3,A taste of what was to come,"Def Leppard's debut (God, twenty years ago!) will immediately bring to mind a very rough AC/DC or Thin Lizzy. Those who fell in love with the polish of ""Hysteria"" will cringe at the rawness of ""On Through The Night,"" but it's interesting to hear little forewarnings of what would become Leppard's great strengths--tight harmonies, hooky riffs, and those sneaky melodies. This album was recorded extremely quickly, and it shows in muddy mixes. Singer Joe Elliott sounds quite different as well--different enough so people familiar with the later Leppard stuff may not think it's him! ""On Through The Night"" has its fans, and for an album that was recorded by a bunch of teenagers it's pretty good, but what they would become would not be properly introduced until ""High 'N' Dry,"" so I wouldn't recommend it to the casual Lep fan."
1,Better things to come!,"Def Leppard's first album! Not much to listen to on this album. The band themself have said they don't like this album. The song writing is the worst. The songs have little to offer the fans. I would say buy everything else from these guys, but save your money on this one."
4,Axeman from Chicago,"The 1st time I heard the main riff to Wasted (from the VH1 Storytellers show) I thought it was one of THE coolest riffs. This album is different from later albums b/c the band hadn't found their sound yet. But that doesn't stop it from being a great album. Other songs like Rock Brigade & It Could Be You are really good too, AND there are a couple of others as well (Rock Brigade & Wasted are probably the best songs on here). The album has a great classic (and punk) rock feel to it. It actually sounds like it came from the early 80s. Joe Elliot's voice is different but it rocks just the same, and the rest of the band also kicks a**! Another reviewer commented that this album is very riff-oriented and I would have to definitely agree there. I love pretty much all of Def Lep's stuff but being a hard rock fan I would have to say that this one's definitely a favorite. I think it's a shame that the band doesn't perform any of these songs live anymore..........."
3,I wanted to complete my collection,"The songs are raw and unpolished but sometimes, you just want to hear the band before Mutt Lange sanded off the edges. I prefer the band once Phil Collen and Steve Clark began dueling their guitars but the oldies are still good to hear."
3,No as good as I remember,This is yet another replacement for a cassette from the past. I quite simply remember this as better than it is. I still like it but has more songs I don't like than songs I do. Just average.
4,Pure Raw Talent Ready to Explode,"On Through The Night..the debut album by Def Leppard had a sound that was a combination of AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. The producers were definitely looking at the boys from Sheffield as the replacement to England's most famous rock group, and it was reflected in Joe Elliott's singing on this CD. On Through The Night is more hard driving than the 'mainstream' Def Leppard that most fans are used to. And personally I think their best track is on this CD..a track called Wasted. It has in my opinion one of the best opening guitar riffs in rock music, but yet this CD is highly overlooked because it was so early. This CD is a great effort by what was at the time a band full of teenagers. If you are any sort of Def Leppard fan, you need this CD to get an idea of what the beginning was for these guys. From this CD onward, you can tell that they were going to be something big."
4,"Back before they were ""chick rock""...","This is a hot record! One of the first albums I ever bought. The production is not up to the Pyromania standards, but there's more variety. As short as Pete Willis was, he sure could rock. Also, you can actually hear Rick Savage's bass playing... Produced by Tom Allom in the Priest tradition. Too bad they got so weak later on..."
4,Listening to this album makes me wanna cry....,"This is Def Leppard's debut, produced by Tom Allom, of Judas Priest's fame. And what a debut. The band really rocks here. There are glimpses already of the kind of pop-metal they would perform later, but this album here is the real thing. The band sounds fresh, passionate, not overproduced, metal and rock blended together in perfect harmony. Rick Allen still did decent drumming (I'm not talking about his terrible accident, because in PYROMANIA - still before the accident - he quit ""playing"", changing it for the awful kind of ""electronic"" drum machine sound, that wnet on and on through HYSTERIA, etc, etc. You can't argue against numbers We all know that with PYROMANIA and HYSTERIA Leppard sold more than ten million albuns. But they also transformed themselves in hair-metal, a thing I despise and really hate. The fact is: if I could pick only one Leppard album, would be this one and HIGH 'N DRY. Never it would be PYROMANIA or HYSTERIA or any other album."
3,NWOBH,"When the NWOBH came to the United States everyone was excited. I mean, the NWOBH swept America with it's raw, unpolised, NWOBH sound. The NWOBH bands included Iron Maiden, Saxxon and Def Leppard. When you listen to NWOBH you can understand the new wave from Britain that changed the Heavy Metal Scene. With Def Leppard, and the unique metal-ness they bring to NWOBH, it's definitely British and Heavy, possibly new. If you're a huge of NWOBH, or just new to the whole NWOBH scene, then you should definitely pick this up. It's a perfect example of the new metal that was from Britain in the new wave era. NWBOH forever!!!"
4,You'd never guess it was Leppard if you only know their newer stuff,"Over the years I've had it on 8-track, LP and CD. It's straight-forward old school metal that bears no resemblance to the radio friendly stuff that would emerge starting with Pyromania. Be sure to check out their sophomore release, ""High 'n' Dry"". It rocks even harder and has much better production.Oh... ""Darth Kommissar"" mentioned in his review that Pete Willis and Steve Clark got kicked out of the band... Get a clue! Pete Willis WAS kicked out, but Steve Clark DIED, he did not get forced out."
4,The Best Work,"I am not a big fan of this band but the NWOBHM, especially Saxon! Anyhow, a lot of leppard fans would rate this album low because the majority of the leppard fans are not really H.M./H.R. fans. I wish the band kept the same direction as this album for the later albums. Any metal/H.R. fans should try this album for the crunchy guitar rills and solos as well as slamming base that you don't hear from the later works of them.Does anyone know what Pete Willis is doing now?P.S. I couldn't believe the fact Vivian Campbell is with this band. He should be playing for a band who plays harder materials."
1,BEWARE! Watermarks throughout the movie!,"The film transfer is very good. However, Reel Enterprises has placed an RE watermark in the lower right hand corner. That is so distracting I can't watch the movie. I bought this DVD as a test of Reel Enterprises' products. I will not buy another RE product until the watermarks are removed."
3,"Nice print, but not complete","I have reviewed this movie in DVD and VHS formats. The VCI VHS tape is 53 minutes long - cut for television without Republic logo and several of the original songs not included. There were three songs and Roy sang on two of these. It was a good print, but the content is standard for all movies of this title. This is not an uncut version."
1,Sad Doggy Tale,"I agree, I bought this for my nieces and nephews ages 3,6,8 and 10. They were so upset when the german shepard dog, see dvd cover upper right side. He was shot dead in the movie by the Sheriff. After he became rabid protecting the characters from the coyotees. Very sad. I would have never bought this if I had known that horrible story line was in there...."
3,For white rice only!,"This product arrived very quickly and tried to cook up some brown rice and found that it was tough. So I tried again with the same results ! Made a call to NORPRO and they were super nice and said that it was intended for white rice only. So if you cook white rice only, this could be the product for you. The chickens didn't seem to mind and ate the rice & produced eggs for us!"
2,Adequate But Flimsy,"We bought this rice cooker to replace one that we had used for more than a decade. While this item works, it is flimsy. I would be tempted to buy a more substantial one."
2,Rice Snooker,"Product nowhere near the quality of the product that it replaced (No longer available) Water sprays out of it, does not produce quality of rice desired."
1,"Junk, don't buy","This worked about 15 times, now it leaks and only shuts off 50% of the time. Look for something else."
2,Fails to shut off,"Purchased this timer two years ago and have used it for one and a half seasons. When it works, it's fine, but about 40% of the time it doesn't shut off. That's sort of the whole point of a mechanical timer; so, I'm now shopping Amazon for a new timer."
3,"It does the job, Conserned about the plastic parts.","I know people have been hit and miss on this product.We have used several times with no problem. It shuts off fine, minimum time is 15 minutes. I am not sure what you are supposed to do if you want to turn it off early. I just leave it and shut off the water manually.I wish I could find a metal version of these type of products, because the plastic just seems too fragile. I have had no problems yet."
2,Not worth it.,"This product is not so great. I bought it for my mom for Christmas since she had been wanting one and it worked, but you have to do a lot of cranking to get it to hold a charge for even just 20 seconds. The little adaptor things for phones are really confusing, even for someone who is good with electronics. There are much better products out there that hold a better charge and are less of a pain to figure out. I got myself the two pack of ""Duracell Crank Light 3 in 1, 3 LED Flashlight, Radio, Charger"" from Costco and it is awesome. If you only want this for the crank feature, it's an ok product (if you're okay with also using it for your daily workout), but if you want to use the other features (which you probably do if you're looking at a combo one) then you should get a different one. This one is lame."
4,Pretty good,"For what I paid for it, this was a good self-powered flashlight. The light is bright and the radio is clear and easy to use. The alarm is kind of lame...it is one of those self-defense alarms and it is not a very good one. Also, I'm pretty sure the cell phone charger is not compatible with either my phone or my husbands (I have a Motorola Razor, he has a blackberry of some sort). Overall, I would say that for between $10 and $20, this is a good choice for a self-powered flashlight/radio. If you are looking for the cell phone charger or alarm, look somewhere else."
1,Crank youself to dead to get some light,"This is a piece of junk. I bought a few crank flash light as xmas gifts for families -- these are the worst of the worst. The first two came broken completely and the company offer to send me replacements. The replacements does not work as it said. It last less than 5 minutes instead of 30 minutes for cranking like more than 1 minutes. If this is an emergency, I think I would need to crank myself to dead to keep the lights up.With shipping added to this, you are paying the same price as this this ""Duracell Crank Light 3 in 1, 3 LED Flashlight, Radio, Charger"". The Duracell works great!! Cranking for 10 seconds you get your lights 10 plus minutes. The radio is fantastic also."
2,it is lie,"the duration of the load is a sweepings, does not last nor five minutes. although you pass ten minute giving him to knob of load, the lantern will go out soon. The radio has very bad signal and consumes fast the load still more.if you are in problems really will save to you, but you will have to be loaded at any moment."
2,battery didn't last long,After a few charges it doesn't hold onto the charge well at all. I would hate to have to depend on it in an emergency
1,Pretty cheap,"It wasn't expensive, and I got what I paid for.I purchased tow of these for emergency flashlights/radios etc... But the quality isn't the best. I would recommend a more well know manufacturer for hardware."
4,Great Idea,The only thing is that the adapters that come with the pack don't fix any smart phones of today. The light is bright and works good.
2,Not what I was expecting,I bought 4 for gifts and the 30 year old gift receivers did not like them. I loved the cell phone charge capability as listed but it turns out the the hookup does not work for smart phones with the larger plugs. I guess they can still be used as an emergency light in the car when traveling but yesterday I saw that everyone left them in a pile at the home where we exchanged gifts--they didn't want them at all and the packages weren't even opened.
1,This item is crap - stay away,"I purchased this last year and used it twice - even then it did not hold a charge for long - after about a 6 month storage of not using it - I pulled it out for Hurricane Sandy. 10 mins of cranking and guess what NO POWER - No Light, no radio no nothing! What good is a crank radio that doesn;t charge? total crap - do not buy this product."
2,Good idea but not bright enough,"The flashlight/radio/alarm is a good idea but there are a few things that this one lacks. The light is not very bright and the flashlight control does not lock into the off/one light/three light positions very efficiently. I found that I thought the light was off but it was still on. Also, the cell phone charging feature which could be very helpful, does not work with usb connectors."
3,Not the best quality,"This flashlight works ok, but there are better ones out there for about the same price. After cranking for a minute you'll get some light, but the battery doesn't hold a charge very long. Good enough to store away for an emergency but I wouldn't want to have to rely on it very often."
5,Great value!,"Works Great! Good reception, better than I expected. Just hit the scan button to search for the next available station. Decent flashlight strength as well. Delivery was very fast. Battery life is a little short. Is it a five star product, well, it is considering the price."
2,Shrugs,I started this book and then put it aside while I read another. Then I got back to it and then aside again while I did another book. For some reason I can't get into it; it fails to hold my interest for long. I'm using it as something to read while I wait for another book to come; therefore only two stars.
2,this should be used only as fossel fuel,this should be used only as fossel fuelOH WHAT A WASTE OF MY $$$$$
5,Bach's Greatest Predecessors,"This CD has been reissued asGerman 17th Century Church Music. It contains Buxtehude's ""Jesu, Meine Freud und Lust"" (BuxWV 59) and ""Jubilate Domino"" (BuxWV 64), the apocryphal Bach cantata ""Schlage doch"" (BWV 53), now attributed to Melchior Hoffmann, and other wonderful solo cantatas by the great Bach's predecessors. Very highly recommended."
5,Fun for the family,Great fun--amazing graphics--easy to play.Family safe.The music isn't annoying!Have Fun!
5,One Great Game,This game is one of the most fun games that I have ever played. You have to work your way through ten challenging levels attempting to rescue the ladybugs that the ants have imprisoned. With a new enemy on each level this game is a real challenge. Hint: don't use cheat codes
1,I never received it,I never received the product and when I contacted the seller he never replied. i loved playing the game when i was younger and was so excited to find it here. I'm very disappointed that never received it.
1,Felt Duped,"I remember this game from the old days. My eldest grandson loved it. I hoped to purchase it for the younger grandson when he got to the age where he liked such stuff. UNFORTUNATELY the seller didn't tell me that I needed an ancient platform to access the game. Money down the drain, too bad."
1,Doesn't print in W2K. Lousy tech support,"I bought it for win2000. Their print driver doesn't work - doesn't print at all. The company acknowledges the problem on the their web site and gives a ""wonderful"" recommendation: ""Cancel all printing jobs and try again""!...? Their live tech support is [expensive] plus per minute charges. Email support answered in 24 hours and even offered call me. The guy was nice but his advise absolutely useless. After going through the routine of checking my printer's settings he sent a word file with 18 steps instructions. ... The file tells you how to uninstall and, then, reinstall the software. What a brilliant solution!... When I told them that it still didn't work, they sent an email saying, basically, that they know about the problem and have no idea what the hell is going on. Would never buy anything from this company and, hope, neither will you."
1,Don't try to use this product with a 300 dpi laser printer..,It won't support lasers less than 600 dpi. No were is this disclosed. Didn't find out until I purchased an $80 MICR toner for my printer. Wow! I could have bought 6 boxs of check for the price of the MICR toner alone. Waste of money!
3,Opening is kinda small and chiller is kinda pointless but solid pitcher.,"I make orange juice from concentrate almost daily and this is great for that, nice light but solid pictcher. The chiller, the plastic part you put ice in before putting it in the liquid makes it so not a lot of drink can be made in it though. The spoon is warped though, permanently bent, so I don't even use it.So, the pitcher is great but all the 'accessories' are junk. Also, my hand is too big to fit through the opening, I have to be 'lubed up' with dish soap to get my hand in there to wash it out. Not a big deal but I have medium hands so those with large might not be able to clean it by hand."
5,Perfect!,"I bought these to replace my current bronze hinges. The swap went smooth and easy. Also, I had a question before ordering and Woodworkers Hardware answered quickest; so they got the order. Thanks!!!"
2,"Terrible picture,great soap!","I was glad to finally get my hands on this long awaited season of Knots Landing but i was quickly dismayed at the very poor quality of the picture and sound. I mean it's like watching and old VHS tape!I think Warner Bros should take a look at the pristine transfers of Dynasty or The Love Boat from CBS studios,they're a pleasure to watch. There's just no comparison.The show itself is quite good although dated in parts but the main actors are all topnotch, i hope more are released soon but i might be tempted to try ordering the complete series from other sources;who knows the quality of their transfers couldn't possibly get any worst?"
4,Bring back Knots Landing!,"I do not understand why the 'powers that be'would not listen to the public and put out all the Knots Landing series.The so -called poor sales from the first dvd were probably because there was no 'Abby Ewing' in it!A major Knots Landing fan,please reconsider releasing the rest of the series.Taz in Brooklyn,NY"
3,"Knots still tops, packaging sucks!","I agree with what the previous post stated: The packaging and recording quality were sub-par, while the show itself and the story lines were all still strong. As far as marketing goes, someone should realize all of the guest stars on that show, that got their break on Knots Landing. Helen Hunt and Eric Stoltz are two that I have noticed, and then later Alec Baldwin, Halle Berry, and others."
5,"Thank You Warner Bros. for this release, I have been waiting a long time!!! WHERE IS FALCON CREST?","I am so glad after waiting more than three years that this is getting a second release on dvd. I have been buying all of the DALLAS dvds, and I am hoping that Warner Bros. will release this title twice or three times a year to get this show out on dvd. DALLAS has only about two more seasons to be released before it is done. So there is major work that needs to be done to get the entire series of KNOTS LANDING!!! And when is FALCON CREST GOING TO BE RELEASED IN THE U.S.? I recently read that the first season is getting a European release, what about the U.S? Come on Warner Brothers please pick up the slack!!!"
4,HURRY UP AND RELEASE 2ND SEASON!!!!,I've waited a long time for 1st season and now am waiting for the 2nd season to be released....I heard it would be April 23rd; now we are in May and still waiting. I check my email everyday. Come on. Hurry up!!! Ive been a avid watcher since Abbey came in and her brother left the show(I won't tell how).
5,It'll take 40 YEARS to buy the Entire Series at this Pace!,"OK, a new release after THREE years?? People, Lets all PRAY we don't have to wait 3 years for the next release. I'll never be able to collect ALL 14 seasons of this excellent show at this release rate. By then I'll either be dead or shoved into a nursing home without enough social security benefits to afford a DVD. Or food.It's been a long wait and I hope people buy up this collection so we can get faster releases of KL, the best prime time soap.So when this is released, PLEASE BUY IT!!Thanks."
4,"When, when, when will the remaining seasons be available??","Love, love, love this show! My favorite nighttime soap ever. It really picked up after the first 2 seasons. When will the remaining seasons be available?"
5,COME ON ALREADY,"GEEZ, it's almost 2012 and we have yet to see the new DVD's of Knot's Landing's Seasons 3 & 4 and beyond. I have 1 foot in the grave already and would love to see them before I kick the bucket. I would also love for my children to have them in my collection. There are many things they will discover about me after I leave this earth and this is one of them. It's funny what a TV show can do for a person. The show was one of a kind! Get the DVD's to the fans please. What is Warner Bros. waiting for?"
5,It is so much fun going back in time,"We are really enjoying going back to the days that Knots Landing spun off of Dallas. It was watching the revival of Dallas that peaked our interest, and we are truly enjoying doing Knots for a second time. We had forgotten how episodic it was the first couple of years. And some of the severly tailored clothes are often comment worthy too."
4,If you want them to release the remaining seasons....,"You have to buy this the 1st week it's released. I hear that's how the studio gauges sales success. So order now! Season 2 is an excellent building season. If we can make it to Season 3 when the show really takes off, everyone will go crazy for Seasons 4, 5, 6, 7...like the good ole days when we used to jump off the couch and yell ""You Go Valene!"""
5,k,"it taste good, and I like it. I dont like that # of words are requuired here though. that is dumb."
4,I Loved Season Two,"As many of you have already said: I sure hope they don't wait a long time to bring out Season Three!Donna Mills adds so much to the shenanigans on Seaview Circle, and it would drive me nuts to have people in and out of my house like they do all the time! But it's very entertaining, and it made me remember how much I loved this show.P.S. As my husband and I watched, one thing we both commented on was how the actors and actresses looked: all were thin, and the women had natural breasts. Such a different look from what's on TV today."
5,WHERE'S SEASON TWO???,"I can't help but wonder why Warner didn't release Seasons 1 and 2 together? I wouldn't have minded that; I'd buy all season sets of it anyway. Season 1 is a (comparatively) different, simpler show than what Knots Landing would eventually mature into. I for one remember, as an early teen, sneaking into the lounge room of a Saturday night (I think it screened here, Down Under, at something like 11.30 pm which is ungodly programming by Oz standards!) to get my Knots Landing fix. Pure trashy and flashy, Knots Landing was and still is great TV! So hurry up WB and get the rest of the series on DVD!"
3,Wake Up Warner Bros!!,"We all know that Knots Landing was one of the most popular shows in the 1980's (and STILL one of my favorite shows of all time). In case the owners of the show don't remember, the best and most interesting Knots episodes came much later in the series - Abby's scheming and confrotations with everyone, Jill Bennett and her brother Peter, Ciji, Chip, Joshua, the twins, Lotus Point, Empire Valley, Olivia's problems, and all the other most interesting episodes happen well after the first season (which was pretty dull compared to the later seasons). Release the really great seasons (3-9 in my opinion) and just see how fast we will buy them!!!"
2,Nice volume but print is really small,What I had hoped for was to get an easily readable copy of this book. The print is just too small for us.
3,"Great book, spotty printing","Ordered a new copy of book I've had for over 20 years. The print quality in this version is poor in some places, with type too dark and heavy to read easily. It's a great book in that it was first written when many of the poets included were still alive (Ezra Pound, even) so it's neat to read about them in the present tense. I just wish the print looked as good as the words are to read."
5,Very Good Resource,I recommend this book to anyone who has a loved one on hospice care or just to learn about the process should the event arise. Very helpful in answering your questions about hospice care and who is involved in the caregiving.
2,Disappointed with Dummies,"I bought this book and The New Marine Aquarium: Step-By-Step Setup & Stocking Guide by Michael S. Paletta in order to plan my new saltwater aquarium. The Paletta book is fantastic, up to date and is everything a beginner could want. The dummies book still pushes the undergravel filter as the best method for filtration. About a dozen websites that I checked dissagree. That's my major problem with this book. Having read both books over the course of two nights, I was astounded by how little information you actually get from this book. No subject is given in enough detail, even for a beginner's book. You will see my copy on ebay soon."
2,Out of Date and sometimes misleading information,"I was very excited to start my aquarium and used this book to start, within a few weeks I found out by visiting stores that I was basically doing everything wrong. I went to buy an underwater filter and they laughed at me and told me that they haven't sold any since the 70's. They also fail to mention how important and easy to maintain live rock is. I didn't even get any until a very knowledgeable sales person mentioned it. This book mentions very little about it and even less of it's importance. Overall the book is terrible, I am shopping for something new."
1,Bad Book. Period.,"I'll keep this short. This book is not worth buying. At all. Half the book is descriptions of different fish and aquarium fauna. Most of the rest is information on equipment. And tacked on at the end, almost as an afterthought, are TEN pages of information on setting up and maintaining a saltwater aquarium. I'm not saying that this book doesn't have a plethora of information. But for someone like me, someone setting up their first saltwater aquarium and looking for beginner information, this book is seriously lacking."
3,Good Information... But,"This book contains the no nonsense approach typical of the Dummy series of books; and contains good basic information on marine aquariums. It is geared for those new to marine environments, and as such is simple to understand.The main issues I have with this book begin with a very limited discussion about diseases, parasites and health issues that ALL new aquarists will run into (Sooner or later). Secondly, all the pictures are B&W; which really takes away from the book.Fair book, but if you want comprehensive details and color pictures; keep looking."
3,"Great information, great sedative","This book is filled with lots of wonderful information for starting your first saltwater aquarium. However, it reads like a dictionary. It's simply need-to-know information without much rhythm. I found myself actually nodding off while trying to read this book at 5 p.m. More pictures would probably have helped keep my interest, but I can't say for sure. Otherwise, Saltwater Aquariums for Dummies had useful information that I was able to apply to my aquarium hobby."
5,Great for the novice Marine Aquarist,"This is a great book if you want to know everything about getting into saltwater fishes and tanks. ... It is very interesting and keeps you turning the pages. If you want to know everything about marine aquatics, get this book and you won't be disappointed."
4,Good information,The book is of course an easy read. Very helpful but a bit dated. There are so many advances if lighting for example that are not in the book. But then again there are other sources for that.
4,Saltwater Aquariums For Dummies,"I am about half way through this book and so far it is a very easy read for a novice like myself. I have no experience with Salt Water (anything) so it would be unfair to criticize anything that this author says, as everything I am reading is for the first time. However, it seems... like this fellow's approach is perfect for the beginner."
4,Really good for beginners..that's me!,"I like this book. It is written in plain English, so you can understand it and has a step by step type format. The author makes things interesting, and reminds you of things that are important to remember. A very good beginners book!"
4,a little dated,"While a few of the references were a little dated, i still think this is a good solid reference. Ignore the references to the under gravel filter and you will be fine."
3,Not for the serious hobbyist,"I bought this book about half a year ago in hopes of using it to set up my first salt water fish tank. This book overall provides a good amount of average information but seems outdated and like other users have pointed out, focuses on under-gravel filter too much. Filter options, lights and other essentials are too briefly discussed and the author fails to provide enough detail to make the reader feel comfortable with having saltwater fish. It also fails to help choose what fish to get as it doesn't mention enough detail about how you should combine different types of which to form a healthy community in your tank. For anyone serious with saltwater aquariums I recommend The Consciencious Marine Aquarist, 2nd edition.The Conscientious Marine Aquarist: A Commonsense Handbook for Successful Saltwater Hobbyists (Microcosm/T.F.H. Professional)"
2,Just the basics - no free tech support,"I purchased this program instead of the more complex Quickbooks to bill on a hourly basis and to provide estimates. Although most of the features I used so far worked fine, I was disapointed with the options for printing a statement. I could only print open invoices instead of the customer's invoices and payment history. Seeking technical assistance, I discovered that www.elibrium.com offers no free techical support whatsoever, not even free web-based support.MyDeluxe Invoices & Estimates is good enough for the beginner with limited needs, but not recommended for more complex tasks.P.S.: The name of this software package may also be ""MyInvoices & Estimates Deluxe."" This review is based on version 5.5 of ""MyInvoices & Estimates Deluxe."""
3,It works so so,"You run out of the gel pretty quickly.... I didn't see results greater than any other whitening product. The light seemed to work better when I used it with Rembrandt's gel.Also, you can buy this in pharmacies for $10"
4,Use with caution,"This product works specially if you are young and your teeth are not terrible stained by age, coffee, tea and other agents.The only problem I have experienced with this product is that if you use it in a regular basis like once a week or so, your gums can get irritated and even they might bleed.I use this product only before special occasions when I want my teeth to look extra white.If you can afford it, I would suggest to use the ones recommended and prescribed by your personal dentist, rather than this product."
1,Product does not whiten teeth effectively,"I have yellow teeth currently, drank sodas such as coke for years and years, have not smoked, tried the product for a week, and have seen no difference in the whitening of my teeth. I'm a teenager as well and I was disappointed this product hasn't worked at all. The rubber trays provided also do not fit my teeth and saliva easily can ruin the process. Not to mention it's uncomfortable to put the tray plus the light transmitter in your mouth for 10-30 minutes."
1,Disapointed,Have gotten this from the White light company before. Worked great and loved what it did for my teeth. This one seemed runny and watered down. Did not work!
1,"Great Show, But Semi-False Advertizing...","When I bought this 3 DVD set, I was under the impression that ENGLISH SUBTITLES were included. And they were, but they were horrible! The subtitles first look horrible and cheap in some odd COLOR on the screen! Then, they are incorrect and even hard to understand! When you read it, you still can't understand what it going on.Because, I had already seen the show, I was able to tell what was being said most of the time, but in the end, I ended up throwing it out in disgust....So, if you are not fluent in Japanese, don't bother buying this DVD set. Save your money for something else."
1,I guess I have no love for Hank Williams.,"Sorry but this stuff sucks. I love country per said but this old style old sounding material leaves me with a cold cold heart. If you're pushin' 70 this might bring back fond memories, for the rest of us, keep walkin'.I like George Jones but here singing straight Hank Williams Sr, he begins to sound like Hank.Only 10 tracks at a total running of a mere 24 minutes. This is either a negative or a thank god its over moment.Nothing positive to say so I guess I should shut-up. George Jones Salutes Hank Williams should be forgotten but thank all who pushed country music forward and away from this stuff. Ugh!Save your money or buy this one from me. (Please)"
1,pw100 hose reel,"I thought this would be good for me, I am handicapped and have a hard time rewinding my hose. It not avery good product, it is very hard to unwind and very slow to rewind I think this product needs more research. I would not buy another one."
5,Automatic Hose Reel that Works!,"I previously owned 2 water driven auto hoes reels, which both ended up in the garbage after two seasons of use. Wasted my money. Read reviews on the Suncast PW100 and bought two of them. So far they are great. I've only been able to use them for two month before season ended. The battery operation is much stronger and quicker than what I had before and that is reeling 100 foot of hose. Not sure how long the battery charge will last, but so far so good. I would highly recommend this product."
3,"Good product, but not completely what I expected","I purchased this hose reel to replace one from the same company that I had purchased at Walmart 3 years ago. After much use the old one broke at the hub in the center that reels up the hose. Considering the climate here in MN thats not bad!I was disappointed however that the reel didn't come with wheels and a handle like previous models. I also noticed that the reel, while it states that it holds 100ft of hose as did the old one, it really holds 75ft well, and seems over loaded when reeling in that last 25ft.Over all I got what I orded. Just not everything that was expected."
1,bad product,"What's the use of a hose rewinder that rewinds okay, but fights you to unwind the hose. Do not even think about this product. Kudos to Amazon for making this return painless and cost-free."
5,The easy way to wind up your garden hose,"This really is a great product. It truly is the ""lazy"" man's way to wind up your garden hose. It can handle hoses up to 150 feet in length. If I only had a little hose to wind up (say 25 or 50 feet), it really wouldn't be neccesary to have the powerwind hose reel, but for those of you who have at least a 100 ft. hose, it really is tough to wind up your hose with those hand cranks. With the powerwind hose reel, all you do is step on the lever, & it winds it up for you. I use my hose quite frequently, & it definately helps out my back from having to bend & crank. I just purchased another one as a gift for my wife's father. I know that he will truly enjoy it. I highly rate this product & definately recommend it to those interested in purchasing one."
3,Powered hose reel,"I had an older version of this product which lasted for 5 years. This newer model is not as sturdy as was the previous one. Also, it only holds 100 feet of hose versus the older model which held 150 feet. In addition the older version had wheels on it to made it easy to move. This unit must be picked up and/or dragged from place to place. I would say that the new model is a result of cost cutting by the manufacturer."
1,Hosereel,"Very disappointed in this unit. While it is easy reel in the hose, it takes a tractor to pull it out. We had to pull so hard, it caused the hose to clamp on itself, and I had to open the top and pull the house out by hand. I think the problem is you are rotating the motor backwards. They should have made it so it would free wheel when going out (like a bike coasting). We returned the unit."
1,Junk!,"Virtually impossible to reel out the hose when it is stored because the container cannot be secured to the ground firmly enough to prevent the entire container from moving and tumbling over. The rewinder works GREAT, however. If they should include a powder UNwinder, buy that unit!"
1,chinzy,The concept is probably pretty good but the construction is the chinzyest (my own word but you get the idea) I ever saw. Extremly difficult to unwind. The traverse shaft is positioned too far to the left causing the hose to overlap. I hope it lasts thru thos year. A poor product.Charles TinkerColumbiaville MI
2,What they don't tell you,I really liked the idea of this product. I'm returning it for 3Suncast PW100 Powerwind 100-Foot Capacity Automatic Rewind Garden Hose Reelreasons. The instructions suggest you have to remove the water from the hose before winding it up. This is to reduce the weight so the motor and handle it. They also suggest removing any attachments. To me that's too much trouble. The final negative is that it cold areas it must be stored out of the freezing weather. I do not have room to store this. Too bad seemed like a good idea.Suncast PW100 Powerwind 100-Foot Capacity Automatic Rewind Garden Hose Reel
3,Problem when located on a cement patio,"I received this for Christmas and being a 75 year old female had trouble pulling the hose out. I ran the motor 40 minutes and used silicon spray on the back of the belt which helps. My problem so far (and I haven't even tried using it for watering yet) is that I have a cement patio where my faucet is. Needless to say it won't stay put when pulling out the hose. If I have it bolted into the cement, I won't be able to take it inside for the winter. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this?"
1,"Defective on arrival, poor design, poor customer service","The concept sounds great, but the motor would not turn. It took 1 hours to troubleshoot per the manual but that did not help. Took over 1 hour to contact the company who emailed more troubleshooting tips. That did not solve the problem. Took another hours to contact the company again, and they suggested that I return it to the store.Following their troubleshooting advice, I discovered that the design of the foot electrical-switch mounting and the motor axle bushing are prone to cause problems. And the handle for manual rewounding will be broken when someone (like the wife or kids) does not know to push down on the lock for the handle. Must read the manual in detail to know that the lock exist. Manual also suggest the the hose nozzle be removed and the hose be dragged back to the powerwinder before using the electrial winder. Hoping for a no-cost refund."
1,JUNK,"Bought this about 3 or 4 years ago. My brother-in-law did too. Had nothing but trouble with the foot pedal that activates the rewind.He had the same problem. Tried looking for parts at Suncast, they don't even have them, Isn't that convenient. No way to replace the switch.It was terrific when it was working right,now it's a yard ornament. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM.."
2,Can't attach hose-stripped threads right away,"Hi,The cheapest part is the plastic hose male threads. I tried 3 hoses and stripped it eventually. I am in my 60's and do know how to attach a hose and this part is really bad. I like the concept though and will make an attempt to get new threads before I return it."
2,"As rating goes down, this gets cheaper and cheaper","yeah, it doesnt unwindyeah, you can't leave it out in the rainyeah, you can't use it on your own when unwinding ityeah, you need to guide it when winding or it tangles upbut it does do its job... kindatwo stars!!"
4,Small hoses only,"Works fine, but if you are going to use a larger hose with this item, don't do it!! It works great for a small, light hose, but anything other than that it will not pull it back in. Also, the battery is constantly going dead, so that becomes a hassel. Overall it works really well for a small hose and that is well described in the product description. Should be used in a small yard or garden."
5,Works great. Buying another one.,"Mine works great. I saw alot of reviews complaining about how hard it is to un-reel and some saying the problem was resolved. Mine un-reels with no problems and reels back in great. After using a water powered unit I find this one to be far superior. The only complaint I have is that the 100' capacity is questionable. I use 75' of 5/8 hose and it works fine. I feel 100' is pushing the limit. I guess it depends on what quality of hose you use. Some hoses are thicker than others. Anyway, I'm ordering another one today to extend the reach since I have a large yard. I've only used it for 2 months but, it's for sure better than my water powered reel which will soon find it's demise in the scrap heap. Maybe I'll set the old one out front with a ""FREE"" sign for someone else to deal with."
2,"Impossible to pull out hose, part not available","I loved my 2-year old powerwind reel (same model), worked perfectly, and ordered a second last summer. It was impossible to pull out the hose. I compared the belts on the older and newer reels, and discovered the interior measurement of the new belt was 1"" smaller than that of the belt in my first reel (17"" instead of 18""). Customer service acknowledged a change in manufacturer had resulted in problems, and sent me a new belt. Still 17"" and too tight. Customer service has not returned my call asking for an 18"" belt replacement. The reel is useless without it."
1,Worst Automatic Hose Winder I ever bought,"You cannot unwind the hose - it is virtually impossible. We have tried everything and still no luck.Last year we bought a different brand and absolutely loved it, this one is TERRIBLE.Would give it NO stars if that was even possible."
1,HORRIBLE TO GET HOSE OUT!!!!,"This is a horrible hose reel. I bought for my elderly mother thinking what a great invention.... step on the peddle and the hose rewinds.... the problem is you can't get the hose out! Even my son and husband tried and unless 2 people are holding the reel down and a VERY strong person is pulling the hose out, it's next to impossible to get the hose out. I tried 3 different styles of hoses thinking it would help. Nothing worked. I'm shipping back today and paying the cost, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
5,Great product,"This hose reel makes gardening a breeze. I used to dread my daily watering because of fighting with the hose, pulling it out, getting all the kinks out, then expending a great deal of energy reeling the hose back in. With this product, all it takes is putting your foot on a pedal to reel it back in. You do not even have to guide it in, it reels it in uniformly. It does take some power to pull the hose out initially, but that is its only downfall. I love my new hose reel and will probably buy another for the back of the house!"
1,Wrong Content!,"Although this book is allegedly a novel by Anatole France, the content is a novel by a Russian author! Someone did not proofread his work."
5,Gangsta,"Putco 480132 Element Chrome Window Visor - Set of 4This dressed up my 300C so well that I get nothing but compliments wherever I go. Starting with the Car Wash, I get rave reviews on how nice my ride looks. Going down the highway, people stare and point to my ride (makes me feel great). I even get compliments from other 300C's and questions of where to buy these cool eyebrow visors. Just what I wanted!"
2,Disappointing. Get the new Cult of Luna instead!,"""Oceanic"" is a masterpiece. Panopticon is nothing more than a buckshot. Production is awfully condensed, of the cheap metalcore style (the new Mastodon album has the same problem). The addition of clean vocals doesn't work as the singing is flat (reference: new Mastodon again) and there aren't any memorable riffs to hook you."
1,Yuck.,"Contrary to what several reviewers would have you believe, Isis always has, and always will continue to rip off Neurosis. Isis doesn't write ugly music like Neurosis' mid-career material? Mosquito Control all the way up through Celestial and SGNL>05 were in the same vein as Through Silver in Blood and Enemy of the Sun, if you ask me. Then Neurosis started putting out pseudo-post rock albums, and Isis followed suit with Oceanic and Panopticon. Yuck."
3,Valuable information on reconstruction choice,"I read this book cover to cover. It is very worth reading for anyone facing mastectomy and a choice of breast reconstruction methods. The author had a terrible time recovering from breast cancer surgery, but it is very important to distinguish between the physical difficulties caused by the surgery itself (relatively minor) and the physical difficulties caused by the choice of reconstruction (major). The large abdominal scar mentioned in another review is a feature of her ""free TRAM flap"" reconstruction, a reconstruction choice that can have excellent cosmetic effects when it works but is very physically costly otherwise. I recommend instead the books on breast cancer by Musa Mayer, who is more thoughtful (and also a survivor) and much more medically informative."
5,A touching account that anyone can relate to...,"My mother had breast cancer while I was in high school. I read this book recently, now 10 years later, after a friends mother was diagnosed. It help me console my friend and her family by helping me remember the real realities of the disease and treatment. Even if you don't have cancer or know anyone that does the touching account in this book make it well worth the read."
5,drifting to glory,"well written book about a civil war expirence! Excellent use of a family history in a fictional type setting, but with enough true history to make the story that much more interesting. A very different way of looking at the war through one man's perspective, his thoughts and the way it really must have been."
1,Run Away!!!,"I cannot warn someone enough against this book that compares singleness to cancer and repeatedly uses the word ""spinster"" to refer to single females. This audio book left me incredibly discouraged and feeling almost like a leper. It wasn't until the 4th or 5th CD(out of 5)that I learned the author was Indian and suggested the route of tradition match-making. I was also blown away when she suggested moving back in with one's parents as a way to expedite the marriage process. I have and will continue to warn singles and even married people to not read this book or anyting written by this author."
1,There are serious problems with this book.,"I am surprised at the positive reviews this book has received from some religious commentators. This book is NOT a good defense of the position that most people should get married. Especially disappointing is the exegesis of key passages in the Bible. As has been stated at scripturallysingle.blogspot.com: ""All in all, whether it be Bible passages or commentaries, I again note with irony how the very sources Mrs. Maken uses to support her position actually devastate it."""
5,Father of 9,"I hear a lot of complaining about this book, but with anything that carries a strong Biblical exortation to right living in a culture that has ran a muck, it is expected. Men, sadly there is little room to be and act as a noble man anymore, but with that said keep trying. Read the book if you want challenged."
1,A Victorian Gossip Mag,I'm sure that some people may like this book but I only got through the first quarter . Gossip magazines and prying into people's private lives has never been my style which is exactly the subject matter of this book; the romantic lives of U.S. Presidents. I would not reccommend this book.
4,Preedential Marriages,"This book concentrates on the Presidential Marriages in the 20th century, and how they impacted the shaping of decisions made in the White House by the Presidents. It has been said thatthe White House made some marriages and destroyed others. This is amply illustrated in this carefully researched book. The analysis of the Wilson marriages, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt, as well as those who followed them, is very illuminating, and clarifies many of the events that occurred during the administrations"
3,Hidden Power: Presidential Marriages,"I liked it and found it informative but a little formulaic and perhaps a bit superficial. However, I learned many surprising things about presidential wives and marriages."
4,Engaging and insightful,"This is a book by a woman, about women, for women, mostly. It describes through these specific grand experiences the frustration and uncertainty that American women have felt for decades...the cultural restrictions, the political awkwardness, the personal adjustments, the pressure to be something other than what one might in other circumstances choose to be. The roles these first ladies chose made the men around them for one reason or another sit up and take notice. And yet the first ladies all had to change themselves, adapt their behavior, manipulate those around them, in ways that men do not have to. I found the author's analyses insightful and clever. I've no idea if they're correct or not, but they did help me to better appreciate women's position in a more generalized way. It's not a matter of sharing or not the political beliefs of the first ladies or the author--this is not relevant to the point. I recommend the book."
2,Long Delivery Time,"Received notice the book shipped on July 22, 2010. Sent follow-up email on 8/11,2010 asking for status. Receives the book a week later. "" Book seller claims it was the Postal Service that caused the delay. Checking other reviews the book seller has given excellent service. I just want to register my situation."
4,"Fascinating and informational, but quite biased by author","The book covers several presidential marriages of the 20th century. I knew very little about the presidents of the early 1900's, so it was fascinating reading about the marriages and issues of the times. It was clearly written by a writer who is not a historian. As evidenced by her footnotes, her research was based on other peoples books, newspapers and magazines such as Newsweek. She also interviewed a number of presidential spouses herself. The result is an intriguing blend of little-known facts and interesting quotes.However, the author clearly formed personal opinions about each and every spouse in the book. Unfortunately her bias became stronger as the book progressed. By the time I reached the most recent presidential marriages, the book had turned into personal commentary of each presidency rather than the informational book it had been at the start."
4,Engaging Overview,I picked this book up at the airport and was pleasantly surprised. It covers a selection of presidential marriages and presents a balanced overview of each. I enjoyed reading each chapter and it made me more interested in a couple of our past presidents that I didn't know much about. I highly recommend it if your interested in presidental history or how the partner of a person in power plays a large influence.
4,Happy Scientific Thoughts,"Beauty is beheld in the art of science. This group has crossed the boundaries between the sub-culture of thinking to reality in its self. Their mix of simple guitars, typical techno beats, and engrossing views makes this a worth while album. I listened to it, and then some more. Socialism will abound throughout this world"
2,Dumb CD,"This CD has NOTHING to do with communism. The music doesn't even sound very good. None of the lyrics even come close to having a communist message. I gave it 2 stars because some of the techno beats were relatively ok. In my opinion, techno/electronica/house is the perfect music for a communist society... it's modern, progressive, intense, and a lot of fun, but it's not subversive or nasty like heavy metal or rap. Music should fulfill people's 'fun' need without making them want to hurt someone.Mike (mlferrini@sbcglobal.net)"
3,Great Book,I bought this book for reference. It is very well written and the info is a great source to refer back to.
1,Idiotic Title: Nothing Secret in the Talmud: Anyone Can Read It,"What a stupid title for a hatred filled book. There is nothing secretive about Judaism or the Talmud. Anyone can become a jew, anyone can learn all they want to learn about Judaism, and anyone can read the Talmud, just learn aramaic and hebrew just as you would need aramaic and greek to learn the Chrisitian Bible. Or read it in English translation. Where's the secret? Where's the ""conspiracy"" Get over it."
1,Antisemitic garbage,"Pranaitis was a Russian priest, universally unrespected within the church. He claimed to be learned in Talmud and kabbalah; his cross-examination at the Mendel Beilis blood libel trial in 1912, however, showed his ignorance of even the most basic Aramaic and Hebrew legal terms. This book is a translation of a Russian tractate containing falsified quotes from the Talmud ""proving"" that Jews have an violent anti-Christian agenda. Even if you are interested in the history of antisemitism, or Russian antisemitism in particular, this book is not worth your money. To see an accurate representation of Pranaitis's ""knowledge,"" consult the autobiography of Mendel Beilis or the transcript of his trial."
3,what would you expect?,What I found in this book did not suprise me very much. Pretty much what you will find in any group about another; especially considering how old this stuff is. Compare with whites and blacks in America.
1,I. B. Pranaitis is a liar. Worthless book,"The Talmud Unmasked: The Secret Rabbinical Teachings Concerning Christians is pure garbage.There are no secret teachings, and his understanding of talmudic Aramaic and Hebrew is so poor, it is embarrasing.this is a worthless book."
1,The Real Question,"The Talmud is not a ""book"" in the normal sense, that it can be just picked up and ""read"" like a novel or a history. Its language and vocabulary can be very technical and specialized; its meaning never clear on the surface. If you think you can understand what's going on on any particular page simply by reading it and taking it on its face value, you are wrong. Not that it is a secret code. Rather it is a complex and extremely sophisticated text that needs to be ""learned"", not merely ""read.""That said, the real question isn't so much the truth value of this book (yes, many of the quotes are real; what the author implies they mean is highly misguided) as it is why has it been republished and why does Amazon feel the need to market and sell it, especially under the ""Judaism"" category rather than the ""Anti-semitism"" or ""Prejudice"" category?"
1,The Fruit of Un-crucified Flesh,"The Talmud, an intentially cryptic work in written form, is not for Christians, nor is it about them in any way. One can not understand Talmud via written form soley, as this is only half of the equation. Eager Christians willing to suck in and spew out poison with regard to Jews -- well, the poison resides with the viewer. Christians will not understand the Talmud as it is; they are intentionally kept ""in the dark"" as the hostile outsiders they are, and if they think they know something about the work, they are deeply mistaken. What Christian reviewers do with what they do see proves that point. They have no idea what they are really talking about. The only thing they are talking about is themselves, and what they bring with their percerptions."
2,Rather Immature for Her Age,"Vampires Fon't Exist is a well written and composed story- for a thirteen year old. Anyone older should be put to shame for ever writing such immature rubbish. Don't get me wrong- the characters are enticing and the plot is well done, but the writing is lacking. If you like great characters and storylines but couldn't care less about literature, or regard for the English language, this book is for you!"
1,Did not enjoy,I have to say that I did not enjoy this book at all. I had read the reviews for this book and had such good hopes for it and was so excited to finally read it and I believe it just did not deliver. I was truly disapointed in this book.
2,Not worth twenty.,"I may be a little biased, but I originally read this work on Quizilla when I was fifteen, and I knew the language was bad then. This girl has good ideas and writes good porn, but her grasp on the English language is painful at best. I'd be willing to give her work another look after she took a few more English classes and got a decent editor. The only reason I looked the book up here was because of the sex scenes (which I remember being hot at the time that I read them), but I don't find the language in the excerpt worth slogging through. If you're looking for an amusing thrill, find it for under five bucks. If you can write better than she can, don't bother. You'll go mad with a highlighter and forget the story completely."
5,dope !,"ill record no doubt, the production is tight and godfather don is an ill mc no question about it buy it if u are into kool keit and sir menelik"
3,It's OK ...,I am a big fan of Albert King because he is a great blues man and this collaboration with Steve Ray seems to be working but not in a wonderful way. Albert King is an old school bluesman and Steve Ray is more rock-blues in his style of playing guitar ...If you are looking for a real Blues music it is not what you get ...
1,"If you love Blues, grab this one!","This one is so wonderful. You can hear the two artists talking together between numbers. So real, so intimate. Wonderful."
4,Legend's,"Stevie Ray & Albert King were a breed of musicians, that the world may never see again, & this recording is a little bit of history that no music connoisseur should miss hearing."
5,My Goodness!,"Dear God,When I die, please send me to the same place as these two. Albert King...in my opinion the greatest bluesman (combination of voice and guitar) in the past 50 years, is at or near his best in this collaborative effort. Stevie Ray, as always, is simply flawless. Some folks complained about the chitchat between tracks, but I thought that it was a nice addition.We might as well have deleted the E and S from the blues with the passing of these two. If you don't have this CD, your blues collection isn't complete."
3,Sorry -- but this recording is not THAT good,"I have read all the glowing reviews. I respectfully dissent. Does no one hear that Albert King is out of tune and his abilities have slipped, and that the chit chat between songs is boneheaded? History is history -- I recognize the awe-inspiring contributions made by both players over the years, but this is not particularly meaningful work by either man. Band is slick but readings of these songs are rather glib. All in all, a great photo, a great idea, but not executed with any coherence. Brilliant moments here and there, but I think Stevie Ray and Albert would cringe at most of the recording. Listen to their best work -- this piece is just a footnote."
3,Better as a historical document.,"If nothing else,this was a very interesting collaboration from two blues greats,paying respects to one another.However,it suffers from a sort of overkill:these two musicians shine better separately."
4,Guitar Gods,"It is very interesting to listen to the banter between songs from the mentor and his pupil. SRV's reverance for Albert is obvious. The production values are a little choppy, but always entertaining. Makes this fan of the blues grateful someone had the good sense to keep the tape rolling when these two strapped-on and cut loose."
5,If you don't buy this CD you are missing out!,"How can you go wrong buying this CD. These two gentlemen are quite possibly the two best blues guitarists in history. The CD is electric, and there isn't a bad track on the entire recording. The session is 16 years old, but it sounds like it was made yesterday. SRV would be proud!"
4,Albert and Stevie burn it up,A very good archival gem from the past. Great Blues guitar playing. I wish that Albert would have shut up and just played. His remarks and asides are irritating and you can see that he had a big fat ego. Stevie just laughs it off and plays.
2,Blues or Blahs,It didn't take off for me until the last two songs except for Pride and Joy. Great musicians but not so great album.
5,A Real Gem,"I've been ramping up my blues collection lately, buying BB King, Albert King, Luther Alison, Melvin Taylor and many others, and for my money this is the best. If you like Chicago electric blues/rock, you can't lose with this one."
4,Two giants on one recording,"Stevie Ray Vaughn often cited Albert King as one of his primary influences. King's tone, passion, and fleet-fingered style all wove their way into Stevie's approach to guitar, but ""In Session"" shows that there was much MUTUAL admiration between these two guitar heroes. King generously allows Stevie to take the majority of the solos, and one can picture him standing back in the studio, watching Stevie in awe. While this recording is neither man's best work, it's a vital document because it captures them together just JAMMING for fun. It's the blues equivalent of Jerry Garcia's and David Grisman's ""Shady Grove"" release -- conversations, missteps, bum notes, and a raw underproduced sound are just as entertaining and inspired as the searing guitar work and soulful vocals. A must for any fan. This might be my favorite posthumous Stevie release."
5,Double Awesome!!,"Albert and Stevie Ray...Two guitar Legends, on One CD. We are BLESSED with this one. Great sound mix, great Bass player, great keyboards. I have the video of this session, but the CD is TEN STARS!!!"
4,Just what I expected.,I liked this stain. It was easy to apply and the results were very good.I would recommend this product.
3,within expectation,"the product is easy to use, although it's not exactly match my existing color, but it's close. will buy next time if I need."
3,Espresso WD Stain,This product proforms the same as any off the shelf stain. Very thin. The wood and grain of the wood control the color of the stain.
3,Saw On TV,"I remember when I saw this on TV years ago. But $349.00 is just ""slightly"" more then I think its worth."
1,Disappointed,"I read two excellent books on this infamous and historically significant tragedy. I then noticed this movie. I was sadly disappointed (so much so that I returned 4 copies I had purchased as gifts). The movie was not true to the facts. Besides taking ""creative license"", the movie lacks good effects and dramatization. For instance, when the many people jumped off the building, the movie fails to include any sound effect of them hitting the ground (that sound was one of the most widely reported aspects to the news articles written by reporters on the scene). Overall, the movie was contrived, corny, and poorly made."
1,Triangle factory soap opera,Not a video worthy of watching. It's more of a soap opera than a historical recreation.
1,Monotony Of Pathos,"If you enjoy pathos in its simple and variant hues you should enjoy this movie; other wise, not much of historical reality into it nor dynamics in emotions or visual scenes."
5,Excellent Pans,"These are great pans. They clean up easy, sit nice and flat on my glass-top cook surface, and I love the color. They are great quality pans at a great price!"
5,excellent work and Great,"Yes. This is the deal. Linda Rosenthal, ! The most delicate, silky sound of the Stradivarius violin, Linda's captivating mastery of the instrument, the most articulate cymbals, brushes, double bass with the richness of the Steinway piano .Simply extraordinary.Those who love classical music and violin."
1,"If you have Lacy/Cherry CD, early Ornette CDs BE CAREFUL","This package is very misleading. There are no cuts of Lacy, Coleman, and Cherry playing TOGETHER. Many of the cuts can be found on Ornette's TOMORROW IS THE QUESTION or Steve Lacy's EVIDENCE (with Don Cherry). Guess I should have read the fine print about this ""compilation"" from the Czech Republic. I admire these musicians but am giving it one star to cause would-be buyers to take a closerlook before ordering this CD."
2,May have no fragrance added but it is not fragrance free,"There are ingredients in this lotion that have some kind of scent so it is not fragrance free - it was very aggravating - I had to hop in the shower and wash it off immediately. If you have sensitive skin, I doubt this is a good choice for you."
3,Van Damme Quadruple Feature,It was pretty good for a Van Damme video. I have only seen 2 of the 4 on this DVD and am looking forward to seeing the other 2.
3,Just Okay,"Time Cop is the best of the four, Hard Target is next. The other two are mediocre.Not Van Damme's best collection.Buy used at the lowest price."
4,Long on Shorty,"If you like Shorty Rogers, and like what he was doing in the 50's to blend his big band swing background (Woody Herman) with the laid back west coast sounds that were coming out of groups like the Mulligan/Baker quartet, here's some more. This is a good collection of early Shorty collaborations including some original compositions, blues and standards. While the personnel is varied, Shorty always played with the best and this collection includes a roster of first-rate sidemen including Harry ""Sweets"" Edison. Highly recommended but not Shorty's best (see ""Courts the Count"")."
3,not that great....average at best,Saw a much better one at walmart. The fish are not that intriguing and do not carry the aura of peacefulness that I had hoped to find in the dvd.
3,Not bad,Happy with DVD only small dislike and that was the sound of the pump running from the fish tank. If you lower the volume on your TV. it minimizes the humming sound.
3,Relaxing but Repetitive,I bought this DVD for a friend with panic disorder. She found this DVD to be less interesting and enjoyable than the one with butterflies - she found the fish harder to enjoy.
5,I LOVE this idea!,"This completely blew my expectations away when I put it in my DVD player and let it play during a cocktail party that I had. Everyone was asking me where I found something so cool and realistic. The fact that it is in HD makes all the difference and it created the perfect party ambiance without the hassels of actually taking care of a fish tank. The colors are bright and vivid, it was like a spectrum exposion in your face! Thanks and keep me posted when you come out with more!"
3,This really is pictures of an aquarium....,HD or not this is pictures of an aquarium. Thought it would be a bit more.
1,Horrible Quality,This video is shot in horrible quality. The colors are all off and it looks like some dude just plunked down a cheap camera in front of his personal aquarium. If you have a 12 in screen or smaller I'm sure you won't notice.
1,the DVDs are defective,"DO NOT BUY THIS! The content is fine. I have nothing against what was intended for this product.What is terrible is that an entire batch of these DVDs have a defect in them. The last one or two fresh water scenes will not be watchable depending on the DVD (and player). I know this because I returned the product for another, only to get the same problem... BUT WORSE.This came straight from Amazon, and judging from another comment, this is a manufacture problem. You can even see it by tilting the disc in the light on the underside. A bubble, or slightly raised section showed up on both discs I have received. Not worth buying, not worth trying to replace. Stay away."
3,Not full 1080 resolution :(,"This is a pretty good DVD for the price. The lighting, colors, variety of fish, and fish action are excellent in my opinion. It's truly a lot like like having a real aquarium. Unfortunately, the footage appears to have been shot at a resolution of 720, which is technically considered high definition. It's acceptable, but you'll be disappointed if you are expecting full 1080 resolution, just as I was. In fact, there's no noticeable difference between playing this DVD through an HDMI cable or a 480 analog component cable. Until I find an aquarium DVD shot in full 1080HD, I'll use this one to entertain my cat (who loves it, by the way. He'd give it six stars if he could.)"
3,Fish Aquarium DVD,"The loop feature is great. Good choice of scenes, very pretty and relaxing. My only complaint is the resolution...it's NOT high definition on my HD TV. I gave the DVD to a family member who does not own a high def television."
2,Nice but flat,I grew up with various aquariums and so expected something else. The colors and scenery in this DVD are great but the constant droning of the pump becomes irritating quickly. What surprised me was dullness of the visual...almost canned. I know it's filmed from a real tank per se but I can't help but wonder if...Would I recommend this to another? Not easily.
3,OK for the price,"Turns your TV into an aquarium. The bubbling sounds will put you to sleep. If you are expecting an action video, this is not it."
4,The Aquqrium DVD,This DVD is an excellent DVD to add to my collection in my office.. My clients enjoy and the children really watch.
4,Soothing in a hectic workplace,"I work as business manager in a very large physical therapy clinic. My office is small and painted dark burgundy with no windows, kind of a dark cave. I decided to set up my portable DVD player and play either fireplace or aquarium DVDs for the soothing effect and something visual besides the walls. This DVD has done the job. The scenes are colorful and a nice diversion to look at while I'm endlessly on hold at insurance companies. The water/bubble sounds are soothing in the background. The scenes authomatically replay so you don't have to keep hitting ""play"" when the scene is done. I'd love to see fewer scene choices with longer run times before it replays but all in all a good choice."
2,Another Repeat,"Just like his ""4 Powerful Rules"" DVD, 95% of this DVDis a repeat of the material on his ""Volatility Primer""DVD. These three DVDs are marketed as being differentmaterial but they're all pretty much the same. I'mvery disappointed that someone with the stature ofLarry McMillan would seek to make money off of aspiringtraders this way."
3,Had Great Potential,"This Stooge documentary had really great potential. It contained very fascinating home movies of the Stooges, and some rare photos. Yet it has really bad narration, goes out of its way to incorporate stock footage from the public domain Stooge shorts, and while it is mentioned that Emil Sitka was going to become ""The Last Stooge,"" it fails to mention that the idea was aborted."
5,Power in a small package,"Love this thing, sounds great - nice, crisp and ""Live"", though it can be a real pain to program in a whole song. Easy to use is an understatement in terms of just creating a loop or playing it in real time. Touch sensitive pads provide at least a small amount of realism to the sound. Great for practicing against as a guitar/bass player!"
4,Simple and functional beyond expectations,"This drum module is the best value out there. It's intuitive and easy to use after a breif parusal of the manual. I was suprised that the unit's housing was as durable as it was when I opened the packaging. I use it as a *much better* substitue for a metronome when practicing as well as helping me during the songwriting phase. Decent selection of samples with more than acceptable quality given the price point.Combined with a Pocket POD, it's great for portable practice with an electric guitar as well. Any changes I would recommend would affect the price point so they're not worth mentioning."
4,Good Blues,Unique album; songs interspersed with dialogue recorded when artist was a taxi cab driver. Some of the dialogue is r rated. Great blues songs
4,Mem's Most Memorable Album,"This was a real surprise when I first heard it. In between some great gutiar riffs and new songs,not retreads, are some ""Taxi Cab Confessions"" which are quite amusing. The sound is a bit raw but certainly works with the over all feel of the album. Mem's songs have a gritty feel to them and its a great cruising album. But what would you expect from a former cab driver. This album is good but his second album is even better."
2,False advertisement,"Picture gave me the false assumption that they were in official Duracell packaging, but the batteries came in an unofficial, non-sealed box. I do not know the quality of the batteries in said packaging, so for all I know some of the batteries could have been previously used."
5,Needed them,Needed batteries for smoke detectors and many other items. The price was incredible and the product arrived quickly. I recommend them.
4,It's Excellent except..........,It's excellent except that the clasp has already changed color a little bit. Can't really believe that such quality item can actually do that.
5,Memorable,"A proud but impoverished Alaskan Indian family struggling to move into modern white society from its ancient culture filled with spirits -- deeply moving, humorous, tragic, yet inspirational."
5,Jan's writing is direct and unflinching.,"Jan's writing takes us deep into the complex human and spiritual relationships between the members of her scattered family. I wanted to know more about them as I was reading it, and I want to know more now.As a 24 year resident, and occasional traveler through Alaska's interior bush I can testify to its terrors and rigors, to its magic and spirituality, and to the gritty intelligence of the people who make their lives there. It is like no other place in the human imagination.Jan uses her Athabaskan heritage, and her Athabaskan style of talking to illuminate the bonds of intimacy between men and women thrown together there by family and circumstance.I like this book."
5,Read this book,"The other reviewers who also gave it 5 stars said it the best. I'm just adding my emphasis that you should read this book. It was inspiring and just a very memorable and eye-opening story of native people growing up in the ""white man's"" world. I enjoyed it thoroughly."
3,Trivial,"This is a light collection of some of the foibles of the English language. Not very deep or instructive, more along the lines of ""why do Canadians say 'eh?'"" Fun to read, but trivial."
3,Pleasant but FAR from compelling collaboration,"This meeting of Malian guitarist Ali Farka Toure and American Ry Cooder is a pleasant listen, but is far from a ""must-have"", unless you are already a big fan of Toure or Cooder. It's pretty meager, considering the rave critical reviews when the album first came out. The music is VERY laid-back, with a couple of slow blues tunes, a couple of instrumentals featuring Toure on a njarka violin, two tracks with Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, and a lot of forgettable tunes. The highlights are ""Soukora"" and the closing ""Diaraby"". Toure sings in four African languages, if that interests you. While I like world music, in eight years I have never once NEEDED to hear this album RIGHT NOW, a basic trait of any really good album. It's nice while you're listening to it, but it evaporates instantly from memory when the CD ends.(1=poor 2=mediocre 3=pretty good 4=very good 5=phenomenal)"
4,"Once again, Ry spreads the music...","Ali Farka Toure was one of the greatest guitarists to come out of Africa, which is quite an achievement, given all of the talent there. His Mali blues sound was as soulful as any of the American blues masters.I would disagree with other reviewers who insist that Cooder has somehow watered down the music - there's great interplay between these two, and having seen Toure on a few occasions in the 90s, I'd have to say that the album did capture his sound at that point in time.Sadly, Ali Farka Toure passed away a few months ago (March 2006). His presence will be missed."
4,dragonfly,"I love this cd. It is rich and sensual. I first heard part of it on the film ""Unfaithful."" I will definitely be buying more of this artist."
4,Talking Timbuktu,I bought this after seeing the film (Unfaithful) in which it figured....an excellent album of african/blues music...very happy with my choice
5,Blues at an African BEST!,"I initially purchased this CD for the song 'Ai Du"" from the movie ""Unfaithful""...As luck would have it, if you like that song, the rest of the CD is even better. Catchy blues tunes such as that on track 5, that remind you of Chicago R&B, mixed with a New Orleans southern blues style of sound and vocals. This CD is an enjoyable, relaxing mix of sound and takes the listener into the souls of the musicians. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to have a little change of pace in sound from the norm of every day radio with it's top 40 pounding out the same sound over and over."
5,If you like different music then THIS is a must,I saw the movie UNFAITHFUL with Diane Lane and Richard Gere and from the moment I heard a couple of notes of this music I HAD TO FIND OUT who this was!!!!! Beautiful music! Love it!
5,Universal Sounds,A stunning collaboration hihglighting Ali Farka Toure's uncanny ability to evoke deep southern blues and Ry Cooder's equallly uncanny ability to blend traditional music with his own jazz and blues sensibilty (as well as that of guests such as bassist John Patatucci and Clarence Gatemouth Brown)in a respectful and successful way. This album will appeal to many people including fans of Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder as well as anyone who appreciates blues. This is contemplative music that can really set a mood; gentle and deeply funky all at the same time.
2,What Do You Expect?,"You know what you're getting going into this just by looking at the cover artwork. If only Vanessa Johansson had been eaten during the opening credits, the rest of this insipid tale might have been sufferable. Despite this being a shark movie, her acting was truly the most horrifying thing on the screen. The rest of the wooden acting, totally implausible story and CG effects are no worse than the majority of the other recent shark movies out there."
3,The guys have done better,"The Statler Brothers are as squeaky clean as any group can get. The guys are apple pie, motherhood, Ozzie and Harriet, pure Americana country. They will not be everyone's cup of tea but one can see why they became so popular. They feature crisp lyrics, clear diction and tight harmony. The 11 tracks here are all by the original 4 guys from Staunton, VA-Harold, Phil, Don and the late Lew. None of them were named Statler! High points are subjective but this reviewer liked the wistful ""Class of '57"" and ""Carry Me Back"". If you think they don't make movies like they used to, then ""Whatever Happened to Randolph Scott"" will strike a positive chord. (It helps to have actually seen a Scott movie!). A snide ""New York City"" was the low point of the album and comes across as elitist-especially for those of us that LIVE THERE! This album may be for established fans. General country listeners may better enjoy the ""Rides Again"" album."
4,Good place to begin Handicapping,"The authors share a point system they devised using the Daily Racing Form. Covers the basics of handicapping. Great for beginners who really don't know where to start with the DRF, but would like to do their own handicapping. Their system was developed around west coast tracks, a nice bonus for those of us tired of the ""East Coast Bias.""Usefull information for beginners and intermediate players and written in a clear and easy to read style."
3,Nothing New,Unless your a novice this book will give you little. It is one of the few books on handicapping harness races that is readilly available but this is a weak work. Ms. Kulleck consistently contradicts herself and she seems to only skim the surface on most topics. Also it seems most of her research with her husband were done years ago and have probably become irrelevant over time.
1,A lot of work for little return,"The book describes a method for rating horses that is very time consuming, with results that do not justify all the work. I did a dry run, handicapping several race cards, and had I bet real money, I would have been very upset with the results. Although I am not an expert, I hold my own when I study the past performances in the track program or The Daily Racing Form. By following the book's method, I did significantly worse than I would have on my own. Not recommended."
1,Run away!,I installed this and used it for a little while thinking it was OK. It is easy but it's also really limited. Then just this evening I realized that it contains copious amounts of Spyware. I ran adaware (a untility that removes Spyware) and it found over 30 items. I'm ticked to say the least.
3,JL Stiles was my math teacher,"Haha I remember when he was my algebra teacher at Skyline Community College, and he had just received the copies of this debut album. He even played some songs for us in class!Needless to say, he was very enthusiastic about this cd when it came out. Much more enthusiastic about it than teaching algebra thats for sure!A nice cd with good music. He was nice enough to give me a copy as he had brought some to school that day to hand out to some of his students who had expressed an interest in his music."
5,Stiles kicks a..(can I say that here?),"Completely original stuff. This guy can hammer out the chords, and he throws in a tasty harmonica - simultaneously I might add to boot."
5,La Scorta: An Un-Hollywood Thriller,"Because Ricky Tognazzi didn't have a Hollywood budget to make this true-crime story work, he relied on the basics: fast action, interesting characters, and genuine tension. Based on the true story of a government prosecutor who stood up to the Mafia in Sicily, ""La Scorta"" is a good buddy movie and great action movie rolled into one. With little special effects at his disposal, Tognazzi creates tension the old fashioned way: skill. He makes even the most simple moments seem dangerous, as they must have seemed for the real-life escorts whose job it was to protect the prosecutor from assasination. ""La Scorta"" is vivid proof of great action movies outside of Hollywood."
5,One of the all time great undiscovered vocalists,"This long overdue CD issue devoted to the magnificent Linda Thompson is a must for anyone remotely interested in the genre of British folk/rock.As the former wife of Richard Thompson, Linda recorded six album with him. Four of these albums were merely brilliant and astonishing, while two, ""I Want To See The Bright Lights Tonight"" (their first) and ""Shoot Out The Lights"" (their last) rank as two of the greatest albums EVER.This compilation includes lots of out takes and alternate takes of songs from that period, as well as cuts for Linda's all too brief (and now sadly abandoned) solo career. It is all extraordinary and sung with her ever glorious vocals.If you are reading this review you must have some interest in ""Dreams Fly Away."" So buy it already."
4,Sweet voices,"This is a great CD for putting kids to sleep. The children's voices are sweet and the selection of songs is good. The instrument solos in the songs, particularly the violin and oboe are done with virtuoso quality.The only thing making it short of five stars is the second half of the CD. The second half repeats all of the 12 songs replacing the sweet melodious children's voices with a glockenspiel. With the possible exception of a bagpipe, one could scarcely think of a worse instrument to use than a glockenspiel when trying to lull kids to sleep. Usually our kids are already asleep after the first half, but if they're not the glockenspiel tends to wake them. Why they didn't repeat the songs replacing the voice with the excellently rendered violin or oboe one can only wonder. An easy solution is to use an Mp3 capable player and use only the first half."
1,the same old stuff,"This would have been cute except that the voices (of the child or children singing) were annoying. The second part is all instrumental, which is nice I guess but the songs are not original or interesting. I was very disappointed in it."
4,Pretty fabulous...,"A nice understated singer who doesn't have to caterwaul or stray outside the boundaries of the tune to be hip. With each disc Ms. Butler gets better and better. In my opinion, she's the best vocalist on MaxJazz -- and really gorgeous a la Horne. I hate to use the overused word, but ""cool"" suits her.Good songwriter, too."
1,Slight confusion here,"The CD and cover are clearly labelled Laverne Baker Blues in the City, but the CD turned out to be one by Phyllis Hyman."
3,Tunnel vision,"It is too bad Miller seems to lack a general knowledge of the human body as it relates to cause and effect. His myoptic view has allowed patients to go untreated in pain as he focuses on a limited area for a cure, perhaps because that suits his student's studies. If you have numbness, even a ignorant person would suggest the spinal column. Not Miller though! Experts are great but they have their limits and should not pretend as peopel live in pain."
3,I have read better accounts.,"During May 1943 no fewer than 41 U Boats were lost to allied forces. From one of these (in a sinking condition) a British serviceman retrieved valuable papers and what he thought was a small wireless set. That item turned out to be one of the latest versions of an enigma machine which allowed U Boat commanders all over the world to decipher their orders. From that moment on, the war against the U Boat was turned in favour of the Allies.In this uninspired account by a former sailor, we have stories of boats being shelled, bombed, rammed and depth-charged into submission. Some were on their very first voyage with a brand new vessel, other were experienced commanders. A brief account of the loss of HMS Edinburgh is also included.With 38 black and white photographs and 3 maps found at intervals throughout the book, this is an interesting subject although not very well written.NM"
4,Well Researched U Boat Stories,"This is a very well researched account of the month of May 1943, when the German Navy suffered their greatest loss of U Boats during the Battle of the Atlantic. It is very interesting how the U Boats came to be sunk. The reading is not always easy because of the detail but well worth reading."
2,Quality control?,I was very happy to find an 18' LCD from NEC. After all I thought NEC is a good name.I was a little bit disappointed during the setup. I only got a decent picture adjusting it manually. I never had to do that with other brands.But in summary the picture was good for the price.But the problems started after around 6 months. The backlight went out. Called tech support. They sent me out a replacement (refurbished unit). TO my surprise it was a defective unit. I had to repeat this 2 more times and still don't have a working unit. I'm waiting for the 4th.
5,A Good Hsing Yi book,"This book and ""Hsing Yi Chuan"" by Master Liang Shou-Yu and Dr. Yang Jwing Ming are probably the best English books on Hsing Yi."
2,NOT UP TO SNUFF,"In a rare performance as the heavy, funnyman Robin Williams disguises himself as an old Scottish bitty to throw fruit at James Bond. Meandering ""high-concept"" picture goes on too long, but nonetheless thrilled 007 fans from Seattle to Shang-hai."
1,"Very overrated, predictable",Why all of the hoopla over this film? The comedy bits were all stolen from other films. How many times have you seen the changing costumes back and forth between two dinners at the same time bit? The writers must take us for idiots. This film didn't have even a speck of originality.
1,Mrs. doudtfire,"not openedBut seen this movie enough timesIts a wonderful family movie, to be watched over and over.Will never get bored with it.Robin Williams is a great actor, who maked the film and Sally Fields is an exceptional actress.The two makes this a great movie."
4,Is it Wide Screen or Full Screen--That's the question!,"This is a delightful movie, one of Robin Williams's best. The concern I have, since the widescreen version has been out of print for some time now and the full screen version was only available as part of a set of comedy movies, none of which I wanted, is this version Widescreen or Full Screen? Neither the photo of the packaging, nor the technical information provided, give any indication of which version this is, and I won't waste my money on the full screen version of any movie that was presented in widescreen in the theaters."
1,It's not widescreen,I ordered this thinking it's widescreen. Just got it. It's not widescreen. It's 1:33: 1 (fullscreen).It's going back.
3,Get your Robin Williams fix somewhere else,"Okay, I think we can all agree: Robin Williams is a brilliant actor and comedian. However, the message behind this movie is a bit immature; this tries to put a positive spin on divorce, which maybe just can't have a decent positive spin at all. If you actually follow the story, yes, the wife should be able to get a divorce; the husband's attempts to thwart their divorce would have been much better spent trying to win back the favor of the wife. And it's not that funny. If anyone could make it work, it would be Robin Williams, but not even he can make divorce funny. If you're trying to help a kid through their parents' divorce, maybe watch this one. Otherwise, look for Robin Williams as the Genie in Disney's Aladdin or as Batty in Fern Gully, for something fun that all ages enjoy."
4,She's in charge.,"Mrs. Doubtfire starring Robin Williams is pretty hilarious. This is an oldie but goodie, Williams is nearly flawless in this dual role. Not sure who cast Sally Field but she seems out of place in this comedy. Pierce Brosnan is easy on the eyes, he's still gorgeous to this day! I like this film but I've watched so much I got kind of sick of it. Good movie to watch with family and friends, enjoy!"
5,"THE BEST COMEDY EVER AFTER ""TOOTSIE""",ALL THE GOOD INGREDIENTS TO MAKE YOU LAUGH : THE ACTORS ARE GREAT (THAT INCLUDES THE CHILDREN!) ; THE JOKES ARE SO FUNNY & THERE IS JUST ENOUGH EMOTION TO SPICE THE WHOLE THING.VERY GOOD MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
4,For my grands,"I've always enjoyed this movie. If I'm channel surfing and run into it, I always stay and watch it again. My grandchildren had never saw it so I ordered it for them. They thought it was very funny and clever."
4,Good movie,"I don't have this movie on video but we rented Mrs. Doubtfire and it was good and I enjoyed watching it and I really liked Robin Williams, Sally Field and Pierce Brosnin and I thought the kids were good especially Mara Wilson. Well really everyone in the movie was good but especially Robin Williams who was hilarious."
4,Mrs. Doubtfire,"This movie is really good and funny. The actors did a great job. If you like comedies, you should definately check this movie out."
1,"Robin Williams take some valium, please","I give 1 star for this movie and it goes to the rubber woman suit Robin Williams wore. It was like most of Robin Williams movies, formula filled, spastic and predictable. One thing that was a mystery was how or why a good looking hunk like Pierce Brosnan would want to marry Sally Field with her three brats in tow? That would have made a more interesting movie plot."
4,Good belly laughs,"I loved this movie,and have seen it several times. It's silly, but sweet, there are some really good visual jokes in this movie.I recommend it."
4,Mrs. Doubtfire,"Well this movie is a classic in my opinion. What a great family fun movie. Robin Williams is such a great actor, he does everything with such passion, and this movie just showed all of that. Buy it you will not regret it."
5,Mrs. Doubtfire,"I would have to rate this movie one of the best I have ever seen, I watch it all the time, Robin Williams is outstanding in his role as well as Sally Fields. Good all around fun, as movies should be."
4,fantastic movie,"Bought this on DVD because the VHS tape was wearing out. Amazon does such a great job of getting your order to you quickly, correctly and most of the time free shipping."
2,Mrs. Doubtfire,"My husband and I enjoyed this movie. It is a comedy and has a lot of funny happenings; shows you can get a job if you really want to. This is a movie we will watch over and over and find new happenings each time, wondering how we missed it the first time we saw it."
5,Wonderful!,"What a wonderful movie this is. I have been waiting for this to come onto DVD in widescreen. I am pleased to see it is getting a 2 disc edition. This was Robin Williams in his prime. Great fun for the family and everyone else who enjoys a nice, fun, feel good movie.I remember seeing this in the theater in Milwaukee when visiting friends for Thanksgiving. It brings back great memories and I can't wait to see it again on DVD."
4,very funny!,this movie was hilarious! and really touching at the end too.robin williams does really good acting too
3,Entertaining if over-cutesy comedy,"Mrs Doubtfire is a sickly sweet crowd-pleaser that gushes sentimentality and features a five-year-old girl so unbearably cute you just want to punch her in the nose.What saves the film is that it is genuinely funny, in both the physical comedy and the dialogue. Robin Williams is on top, laugh-out-loud form. There's no doubt it entertains, even if you have to endure the manipulative, trite and saccharine Hollywoodishness of it all.By the way, any Brit would have seen through Mrs Doubtfire in a second: She claims to be English, but her accent is clearly Scottish; and she seems to think England is an island."
5,"Love this movie, great buy","Hilarious, even today. Robin Williams in one of his best movies in my opinion, great price for a great movie!"
4,Good.,"This is a good movie but it reminds me a lot of Tootsie(1982). it is aboout two parents who get divorced played by Sally Field and Robin Williams and she will only let him see the kids on Saturdays. So to see the kids everyday he disguises himself as a nanny. It has some good tag lines but some just fall flat. The funniest part is when he puts the cake on his face and says ""Hello!"". This movie is funny but if she just let him see the children after school for a few hours at the beggining of the movie It would have been over but I recommend it."
4,"Anthony Michaels review of ""Mrs. Doubtfire""","Mrs. Doubtfire, while it's not the best movie I've ever seen, is a well done movie, with an original story and fantastic acting. Robin Williams could be at one of his best edges in this film. It is worth the time to see, if you enjoy comedy and some drama. This movie is worth the time.ALSO STARRING ROBIN WILLIAMS-Aladdin-Flubber"
1,Mrs. Doubtfire's re-issue is falsely advertised as ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN!,"MRS. DOUBTFIRE (Widescreen), is NOT an ANAMORPHIC re-issue. It has the same LETTERBOXED substandard transfer from the 2003 release, plus the added features. The outside sleeve states ANAMPORHIC 2:35, which is a LIE and FALSE advertising. This is NOT the first time FOX HOME VIDEO does this. They also pulled this scheme with THE ABYSS!!!. You should complain to FOX and clarify this in your information for this item in your web site.the quality of this DVD is NOT up to 2006 standards, and FOX should replace ALL these discs with a quality new ANAMORPHIC transfer as advertised, or better yet, release it in High Definition. Shame on you again FOX HOME VIDEO!!"
5,Mrs. Doubtfire,This is Robin Williams best movie ever. this movie is so funny it will make you laugh from begining to end. and it has a lot of heart. this movie is awesome. Robin Williams is at his best in this film. if you have not seen this movie then you should.
5,Mrs. Doubtfire,"An out of work voice-over actor and his wife get divorced, with the wife gaining custody of the three children. Unhappy with the alotted time given him to spend with the kids, the father dresses up as an old lady and gets a job as the kids' nanny. Anyone who doesn't laugh while watching this movie should check into a morgue."
4,Nice quality pants for training or the gym,"Got these on sale a few weeks back and they are stellar. They're very comfortable and fit nicely, though the inseam is slightly long for me. I think it's about a 32"" and I'm normally a 30"", but it's not that big a deal. These are perfect for the gym, running, and what have you. Will probably pick up another in the near future."
4,A fun game about celebrities,"I wrote a review about this game in the other Marry Date or Dump section. Basically, there's three names on a card, like Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks and Tom Selleck. On your turn, depeding on the roll of the special die, you decide who you would marry date or dump, or who you would want for a doctor, lawyer or pool cleaning boy. Other choices are parent, sibling or cousin, and party with, live with and wrestle with. Other players try to guess your answers. They score one point for each one they get right. When it's your turn, you get two points for every person who voted for all your choices correctly.A fun game that's now out of print, but Amazon.com has it. It's from 2004, so most of the current big names are included here, including fictional characters, politicians and Biblical names. The box is divided into men and women, so gay or straight people can play this game. If you're bisexual, you can alternate between the two boxes."
4,A Very In Depth Read,A very comprehensive review of current and historical events that have shaped the people of Appalachia. The events and history that have molded the people through their thought processes.
5,Great for those looking to start with martial arts...,"This book is great if you're looking to start training in martial arts. It gives very useful tips for determining the right school and right instructor. It gives summaries of several different martial arts styles and even explains what skills, such as flexibility and endurance, are needed for a few of the styles covered."
4,A Good General Introduction to Martial Arts,"This book provides a good overview of martial arts. It is a particularly good book for someone who is just thinking about getting involved in martial arts training. The author gives a brief introduction to a wide variety of styles and what to expect from each.Ms. Lawler also gives very helpful information to a prospective or new martial artist on ranking systems, training routines, competition, and even some self defense basics.I think that this book is even good for more experienced practitioners of the martial arts. It covers a lot of interesting information on history and various tidbits on the martial arts culture and different styles. It is definitely a worthwhile purchase."
5,My most questioned shirt.,"I've had this shirt for a few years along with many other quizzical ones and this by far gets the most comments by people. I've had people shout from across the street ""no it doesn't!"" Be prepared to explain why because people will want to know. If you prefer to avoid human contact don't buy."
2,What could have been....,"One of the greatest keyboard players of the past century, playing over-produced, tarted-up 60's shag-a-delic go-go music. The horns, strings and aaah-ing chorus are painful, in and of themselves. But the fact that they are drowning out Nicky Hopkins' piano playing is a crime against art and nature. For solo Nicky, get Tin Man instead, and look for No More Changes, which NEEDS TO GET RELEASED ON CD or MP3!!!! And don't forget all his incredible playing on albums from the Stones, John Lennon, The Who, The Kinks, the Jerry Garcia Band, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver, etc, etc. The guy is amazing."
2,Interesting,"Interesting early material from this great piano player. What ever happened to his great solo album ""The Tin Man Was A drummer""? I've never seen it on CD."
5,Curious about Ayurveda,"Being in the Spa/Beauty industry Ayurveda is a word being used more frequently. I was unable to answer ques. about it when people would call the Spa I worked in and it was quite embarrassing. I bought this book, and it has helped me gain the knowledge to answer the ques. intelligently and sparked an interest to futher my education. It is a very interesting and educational read that I recommend to anyone who is new to Ayurveda."
5,Impressive Quality and Performance,"After long research felt skeptical about the quality at F2.8 but decided to get it. I am amazed with the pictures that I took with this lens at all apertures. When compare to the kit lens even at F2.8 the pictures taken using Sigma are way sharper, few reviewers mention about soft image at F2.8 but perhaps my results are different as maybe the kit Olympus lens which is made in China failed quality control and as a result I end up with bad lens. I accepted the quality as standard and would probably never know. I'm very happy with this lens and highly recommend them to anyone."
3,laptop,"Like the screen and keyboard layout but processor is slow. The laptop is somewhat large to carry with you and is heaavy. Have had diffulty finding replacement battery. Best used atationary. Battery life is somewhat short, large 17"" screen uses alot of battery power."
3,"I, Monster",This is a classic Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. It is very different from the movies that I am used to see Lee and Cushing in.
3,Jekyll and Hyde revisited...but very slow and boring,"The movie is just another remake of Jekyll and Hyde. Lee injects himself with an experimental drug that destroys the superego and eventually his alter ego starts taking over. It was OK but nothing noteworthy. I normally enjoy Lee/Cushing films but this one was painfully slow and the actors seemed bored with their roles. About half way into the film I started picking up the family room which was a tad more exciting than the movie.The 3 star rating is from Lee/Cushing acting through the painfully slow pacing, the settings and costumes. I am partial to movies from the time period."
4,Just like the movie,"I wanted to read the novel soul food to see if it included anything that was left out on the movie, I was surprised to see that the book, and movie was pretty much the same with only a few small differences. I didn't realize Terri was so jealous of Maxine. I liked knowing what the characthers were thinking."
5,Great follow up,An added bonus if you already have the Statlers first Christmas album. Little Toy Trains is now one of my favorites.......brings back great memories.
5,Christmas joy,I had this cassette many years ago and it was always a favorite. I was so glad to find this music again. The songs warm my heart with good memories.
3,Not as good as the first.,"The strength of the first Mambo Inn project was the pairing of great dance DJ's with phenomenal artists from around the world that you may never have heard of. This cd drops the remix emphasis in favor of the artist's standard recordings and, I feel, drops the allure that made the first Mambo Inn so unique. I still think it is worthwhile for those who like world music, especially latin music."
5,I am dancing in my kitchen!,"Been in love with tom-toms and bongos etc. all of my life. So glad to have been walking through an outdoor shop in San Diego, California USA, on a trip and heard this music playing, asked about it, bouhgt it, pretty much shelved it once I got home. Five yrs. later I am thinking this would have helped me keep my girlish figure! For one thing, it is happy music! Another thing, it makes you want to move your body!Love it, just ordered the first Mambo Inn, and from the reviews, the first is even better than the second!I say buy it, it is wonderful."
4,WOW,This was one the best books I've ever read. It has everything from drama to comedy to life advice. Some of the events in the book made me cry and others helped me get through similar situations. I highly recommend this book to any and everyone who has ever had problems.To the author: Keep doing yo thang girl!!!
4,A heartfelt and amazing fusion of two disparate musics...,"Steve Tibbetts goes to Nepal and records the chanting of a Buddhist nunnery and takes the tapes back to St. Paul, where he overdubs his trademark blend of ethereal electronics and acoustic guitar. Some people might view this as sacrilege, but the results are anything but. Cho is a deep, meditative excursion into another culture. It lacks the firestorm of savage electric guitars that one would usually find on a Tibbetts album, but they would be glaringly out of place here anyway. Strongly recommended, especially to fans of Tibbetts's quietest album, Northern Song."
5,Beautiful!,"This CD is by far, one of the best examples of Asian music. I really enjoyed how Steve Tibbets combined Drolma with modern instrumentation, without losing the distinctly Asian flavor of the singing style. If you like Ibuki, you will LOVE ""Cho""..."
2,Not his best - for completists only or those interested in Buddhist chants,"I agree with Colin R. Glassey. This is only 10% Steve Tibbetts. I'm a huge fan but I would not recommend this as an introduction. Tibbetts is of course respectful and thoughtful and although this is a brave and adventurous attempt, for me it just doesn't work all that well.In Hollywood they say ""god made it sing"", but here god seemed more indifferent. Steve is way smarter than me so someday I may see the light and change my opinion but so far no."
4,THIS IS NOT A REMASTERED VERSION!!,"First CircleThis is NOT a remastered version of the Pat Metheny Group's 1984 masterpiece. I have been eagerly waiting for a digitally remastered reissue of First Circle, one of the greatest jazz records of all time, and I thought this was it. But this is just a Japanese reissue (or reprint) of the AAD 1984 disc. There is nothing in the liner notes that mentions a new master; also the copyright notice has the date 1984 and the disc has the tag AAD. It was not printed from a new master. The description that Amazon gives for this item is **misleading** and should be revised. I bought the CD for a steep USD 28.29 (+S&H; to Europe) and I will keep it though, as a collectible item. See http://speakeasy.jazzcorner.com/speakeasy/showthread.php?t=20661 for a discussion of Japanese ECM reissues. If you're looking for a true remastered edition of First Circle do NOT buy this item. Be patient..."
4,first circle,"pat metheny group;first circle cd is mellow and smooth,and it got his distintive sound like his other albums it,s a good album i enjoy it very much."
2,Is Renee Russo supposed to be Emilo's mother?,"Because she sure looks like it. Emilo didn't get the good looks of his brother Charlie Sheen, or the talent. But he's cute in a little boy way. I thought Mick Jagger was pretty good in his role, he underplayed his part and it worked for me. The vehicles look cheesey now but the premise of the story was new. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as always but his part was very small. If you can over look some of the cheezieness it wasen't a bad movie."
1,The worst film I've ever seen.,"I really cannot stress how bad this drivel is.I cannot think of one redeeming feature about it,except maybe Anthony Hopkins,and I really cannot figure how he got caught up in this unspeakable mess."
5,awesome,"This one of the coolest sci-fi movies you will ever see, the whole concept of this movie is so fantastic, that who knows if it was ever possible. Life might be just like it was portrayed in the movie. great acting, by a whole bunch of great actors even Mr.Rolling stone himself wasn't bad in this movie. Although the the music of the Stones is what he will be remembered by not his acting. You won't be dissappointed even if you buy this movie un-seen, because when you do see it you'll agree with me I am sure."
3,Interesting Story Line!,"Thought provoking action/adventure.Emilio Estevez make a believeable hero.. Mick Jagger plays a very good ""Bad Guy"" (Didn't think Mick had it in him!!)"
5,Original and intirguing,"Well casted, great performances from everyone. Totally original concept, I've never seen another film like it, or with Mick Jagger! He can actually act. After all these years since I first saw this film, there are still many scenes that stick in my head."
4,The fifth revelation,"I really enjoyed the book by Kelly Elstrott. I listened to Kelly on a talk show one night and his insights inspired me to read the book and I'm glad I did. The book is a nice primer for the Urantia Book and I plan on abtaining a copy asap. My definition of a good book is one that inspires thought, reflection and the thirst for more. The fifth revelation falls into this category nicely."
5,Simple and brilliant,"This brilliant little book shows that it is possible to overcome morbid obesity (and many other health problems, I might add from personal experience), by doing something as simple as turning off the stove and eating a vegan diet as it was meant to be eaten...raw, fresh, and delicious.Angela Stokes is an inspiration. If only everyone could have a copy of this book."
4,"Keaton, as usual, turns in a brilliant performance","I acclaim Diane Keaton highly for her expectional work in this movie. Had she not been picked to act Amelia Earhart, the movie would have been a dud. The movie was not a great hit, but it was well-directed. I learned so much about the real aviatrix through this movie. Rutger Hauer was very good as a alcoholic navigator who goes with Earhart on the final flight. Both of them steal the floor. But it is Keaton who makes this movie worth watching. The final scene left me in tears- it was very poignant. The sky, the sun, and the subtle dialogue was blended very well. This movie is suggested for those who are interested in learning more about Earhart or just want to enjoy more of Keaton's expectional talent."
5,An incredible woman and teacher,"Stella Adler was possibly the last of the great ""master teachers"" of acting. A student of Stanislavski himself (as opposed to Lee Strassberg, who took everything second hand and made himself more important than the part), she is everything you could wish for in a teacher. Her passion for the theater and all it touches is incredible; and since, in her view, theater touched on everything from the classics to the drunk asleep on the Bowery sidewalk, she encompasses the world.Any artist should see this film. Any writer, any actor, director, dancer, teacher. In fact, now that I think of it, everyone should see this film. She was that rarity among rarities; a teacher who imparted life with every breath.Janis Ian"
4,gansta rap at a new level,"the album has a strong tupac/gansta rap feel,the album definitely rides.might be a little to rough for the younger listeners."
2,A Simple CAD program,"I'm not sure why this is called ""Instant Deck Design"". There are a few canned deck designs in here. If you want to make your own deck design, you are basically given a standard CAD package that allows you to do 2D or 3D packages - there aren't even any canned deck accessories.I did find the program useful, and I did draw my deck using their 2D tool. I was hoping it would help with structural calculations, etc., but it doesn't. So don't expect any help in pier locations, beam sizes, lumber selection, etc. If you select a canned deck it does provide a material list, but not if you draw your own.Summary: Inexpensive, allows you to draw your deck, but really not much help other then a drawing tool."
1,"Waste of Time & Money, even with the rebate","If you want to design a deck and get all the stuff this software claims, go elsewhere.I spent several hours with it and could not find help on posts, joists, beams, or materials. It's not even a good CAD package. For material lists, you'll do better with a spreadsheet.There are much better packages available a builder's stores; or, be old fashioned, by a book!It's cheap, and not even worth that!"
1,Don't waste your money,"As others here have already pointed out, this product is pretty worthless. I wish I would have read them myself before I wasted my money. I originally thought I couldn't go wrong for only $5, but I should have seen the red flags when they charged me another $10 for shipping and handling!Again, as others have said, the design options in this software are very limited. And don't even try to design a deck with dimensions less than ten feet -- it won't let you do it."
1,Most worthless software I've ever bought,"I bought this software because I was building a deck, and I need a print out of what it would look like.This software would not let me input My Data, it would only allow me to use there designs.So save your money, lookup free deck designs online"
3,Not his best,"Uris was still an awesome author, and I can't believe I hadn't read this one. Not bad, not great, certainly not on par with most of his classics...."
2,An inferior Uris work,"First off . . . I love Uris' work. I was enthralled by both Battle Cry and Exodus. I am eager to read The Haj, Trinity, and QB VII, et al. But -- I had a bad experience with The Angry Hills, and was affirmed by reading that other reviewers also said.For the locale of this WWII cloak & dagger book, Uris chose Greece. (Uris clearly likes Greece). Plot: Visiting American author is trapped by the German takeover, and secret British information falls into his hands. He MUST get it to the proper authorities, blah, blah, blah. A Colonel Klink-like character is hot on his trail. He deals with a couple of Greek hotties along the way.This is a boring book. It was a labor to finish it, and I shouldn't have (but I'm like that). I suggest pass on this one."
3,An entertaining war read but disapointing by Uris standards,"While the book is an entertaining war novel it is dispointing by Uris standards and does not compare to such greats as Exodus,Mila 18,Trinity,the Haj and Armageddon Mike Morisson is similar to Uris' other American heroes -Gideon Zadok in Mitla Pass and Sean O Sullivan in Armageddon.Spoiled men used to the good life who show great courage in battle but lack any moral courage.They take love for granted and cruelly hurt the women who love them.They are highly egocentric and unlike Ari Ben Cannan in Exodus,Andre in Mila 18 and Connor in Trinity,the American heroes have little real commitment to any cause If you looking for an entertaining war read go for it but dont expect profound literature"
2,Dull and cliched,"While conducting business in Greece during WWII, American writer Mike Morrison is trapped by the German advance. When he comes into possession of a secret list of Greek patriots who are pretending to be collaborators, he must go on the run to escape the enemy forces that have been assigned to retrieve the information. This is the only book by Leon Uris that I have read. I was under the impression that he was a writer who researched his subjects meticulously. Perhaps this was one of his first books, because there is very little local color here, nothing that one couldn't glean from watching movies and skimming a few travel books. Worse than that, the characters and situations are cliché from start to finish, and the prose is dull. It reads like a treatment for a typical 50s WWII flick."
4,Very Good - But Not GREAT!,"Plenty of power to drive the six speakers and ample volume level. Speakers not as robust as originally led to beleive...however, for $500 it's hard to beat the good sound quality generated by this system...given the size of our room and general listening preferences. If your listening preferences don't demand the loudest volume level you can except good sound quality, (but is less quality/purity than what you would get from much more expensive speakers), then this system is very good! Can't really complian and would recommend anyone wanting a 1st time HTS to investigage this unit before making your buying decision...it can rock and maintain fairly pure sound reproduction at moderate volume levels...but have noticed some distortion and less than 100% clarity at upper end levels!"
4,An Unknown Gem,"I had heard the opening number ""Walk Him Up the Stairs"" and one other song ""I Got Love"" and wanted to get more familiar with this score. I'm glad I did. Each song is great and helps propel the plot along as it should. ""Walk Him Up the Stairs"" is incredible in it's enthusiasm, all-out singing,and infectiousness. Likewise, Melba Moore (a Tony winner for this show) delivers an incredible rendition of ""I Got Love"". The rest of the cast are very good performers and the score does not suffer ever in their and the fine chorus' hands. The engineering is a bit crude but I'm willing to forgive that given the recording's age. The liner notes are of a fold-out nature and really offer no insight into the making of the show or its life on Broadway but the synopsis is good. It's sold at a good price, fun, and a good investment. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
3,"A good addtion to my Broadway collection, but.......","Just hearing Melba Moore sing ""I Got Love"" is worth the price of the CD. And Linda Hopkins blows me away every time I hear her sing ""Walk Him Up the Stairs"". I was somewhat disappointed with parts of the score, but I'm still glad to finally have the CD in my collection. Love the cover art."
3,Not what I expected,"Although I also like the music in the musical I thought I was ordering the actual play on a DVD, so I was disappointed to find out I hadn,t."
3,At least a few good songs,"I guess it's a bit to heavy for me, I'm more into thrash metal as far as metal in general goes. I only payed like $3 for it so it was worth it anyway."
1,ONE NOTE MOVIE.,"I'm gonna keep this shorter than my usual movie review. That's because there really isn't much of anything going on in ""Coach"". The basketball coach of a high school boys basketball team is fired and the school then looks for a replacement. They accidentally hire a woman (gasp!) to coach their team. Yup...that's it. There isn't much more to the story...It's difficult to watch because it is so uninspired."
3,Don't use this book for the new 2002 test,"I do not recommend this book for those who wish to pass the 2002 version of the Network+ test. The technologies covered on the new exam are not covered in this book (because this book was printed last year and the latest version of the Network + test was released this year). This book does not cover things like wireless networks, gigabit ethernet, fiber cabling, etc,--all required knowledge for the new exam. Do yourself a favor--if you want to pass, find a book that actually covers the new exam objectives."
3,"OK, but with significant gaps","I'm about 40% through this book in my preparation, and it is giving me lots of useful material for the exam, especially in details on TCP and consistent references back to the OSI model. Clear gaps, however, include no coverage of the 2002 Network+ updates and a complete absence of discussion on AppleTalk. It was worth the price paid for a ""used"" copy, but clearly not sufficient as a sole study book."
2,If you like Cuban music maybe you should go for a Cuban band...,"If you like Cuban music maybe you should go for a Cuban band...Not much else to say about it; most of this guys have visited Cuba only after years and years of playing Cuban music. Isn't that a bit silly? Good musicians, well played music... in other words - a very average experience"
2,Buy Cubanismo!!!,"Do not mistake this band for Cubanismo, because that's what they aren't... This is certainly an interesting band, but only because they come from Croatia, which is an interesting place to start a Cuban music band. However, if you like Cuban music and must have yet another Cuban album, buy Cubanismo rather than these guys since they are boring, boring, boring, boring, etc..."
5,Superb -- and Disturbing,"For the classical enthusiast, this is a must read. It puts into great perspective the problems currently facing us -- and frankly leaves me despondent about the future of live, symphonic music. Everyone involved gets blamed: conductors, soloists, union members, orchestra managers, audiences, composers, music schools...The book is nicely divided into historical periods, and all the big (and not so big) names are here. Horowitz obviously knows his subject, writes about it passionately and communicates to the reader well. He also likes obscure words: more than once I had to grab a dictionary.There's a nice Naxos web page that offers up substantial samples of much of the music mentioned in the book.My only complaint is that I wish he had added a last chapter: What We Need to Do! There are plenty of people who need to read this book, but I fear that it's length will prevent wide readership."
5,its all true,"Believe everything these people say......they are not just orbital fanatics. They describe this album perfectly. I originally bought this album in a store because it was in a bargain bin (the case was VERY damaged) and I had heard ""the box"" before. This was easily the best 5 bucks I ever spent. I feel bad for ripping them off like that, because it is priceless. I hate to sound like Stuart Smalley, but ""Somewhere Out there"" is, well,...........life affirming."
4,almost too quirky,"This album was one of my earlier techno purchases and it was great at the time. The more I listen to it the more I find to like. Although I was originally most intrigued by the second album the first one is far more challenging and has more to explore over time. Now that I have listened to more electronic music and am harder to impress, I would like to say Snivilization is actually more to my liking."
5,Absolutely Superb,"I could spend all day trying to think of something bad to say about this CD, but it's impossible. Every song is awesome. It is Orbital's greatest achievement, much better than Orbital 2 or even Snivilization! ""Out There Somewhere?"" is the best song I have ever heard, mark my words. If you would have gotten this CD before 1997 you even could have gotten the Times Fly bonus disc, with ""Tranquilizer"" and a 30-minute version of ""The Box""! If you pass up this CD, you will never have really lived."
5,Orbital best of the innovators,"I was shocked when I picked up URB no.62...The Innovators issue, for they left out one of the greatest influences of my life, Orbital. If it wasn't for Orbital's ""Chime"" or ""Halycon+on+on"" I would still be listening to Blind Mellon or Aerosmith and not slicin' up my own grooves. This CD packages the best of orbitals vision in one handy two cd set and only 14.99! Amazing! This is one of my most spinned album when I'm mixing a party, nobody can resist Orbital!"
5,Nothing less than Orbital's defining moment.,"Where to start? As an Orbital fan, I have carefully listened to each album, from the early promise of 'Belfast' on Orbtials first cd, through to the oddities collection that is 'Altogether'. But this is it, the moment they reached the top of thier form, producing music , that in my opinion, has not been recreated before or after. 'The Box' alone is a work of art, chilled and distant, and utterly amazing for 1996.""dwr budr' is sci-fi bliss, soundscapes that move and twist over etherial vocals and broken beats, beautiful and mysterious, this may be one of my favorite Orbital tracks ever,and its influence can still be heard even in Trance dj's like Sasha and Digweed. Other tracks like 'Adnan's' are more of a wandering take on break, melodic and drifting, while 'P.e.t.r.o.l.' is much more agressive and impacting. This album sweeps you away and never lets go, and sounds just as good, if not better, 6 years later. Buy it."
4,silk four grasp paint echo,"orbital has quite a distinctive sound, so i can't really recommend it generally. although i like it in an ambient sort of way.electronicaish, soft breakbeaty, ambienty, a touch of the concept of trance but not the accompanying techno beat.similar? hrm, if you cross Jean Michel Jarre with the Future Sound of London and Aphex Twin, perhaps.it can be quite repetitive and the electronicness of it gets to me at times. but i'm glad i have this cd for ""The Girl With The Sun In Her Head"" and ""Out There Somewhere?"" (fond of the stereo-sound ambient tranceyness of part two). maybe just try those on for size if you're curious.good ambient/background music."
5,Layered ecstacy,"Usually I review the works I have bought that have brought me great pleasure. It is a rare treat to review an album that changed the way I think about music. The way these Hartnoll brothers construct a song- with layer upon layer of offbeat synchronicity- will make the listener think. It will draw you in. It will console and teach you. I wish I could hear the 30-minute version of ""Box."" I like ""Out There Somewhere"" less than some of the reviewers here, but there is no weak song on the album and worthy of note are the aggressive stress noise of ""P.E.T.R.O.L."" and the pure aural enlightenment of ""The Girl With the Sun in Her Head."" Please listen to this album once. You will be ready to buy it. And you will be glad."
5,"Everyone talks about The Box, but for my money...","'Adnan's' alone is worth more than whatever this CD is selling for. Of course as a bonus you can have The Box, and the 2nd/bonus disc too! Pure hypnotic genius. A must have!"
4,Find the Other 2nd Disc,"In Sides is a good Orbital album -- but there's a different release (note the ""U.S. Release #2""?) that has a 28-minute, 4-block mix of ""The Box"" on it that is utterly stellar, featuring clocks and creaking boards (gallows?) and even lyrics before it's all done. The two shorter versions of it on the first disc are just the teaser-trailers for the real feature.From this set, ""The Sinner"" is a good industrial remix of ""The Saint"", but it can't compare with the demented poetry laced in from minute 22-27 of ""The Box""."
3,When techno was all the rave,"3 1/2Undoubtedly a high mark of mid 90's overground electronica, IS contained all the synthesized loops to ensure glowstick coverage for years to come, but has, in its old technological age, begun to show its standardized mechanizations behind bubbly production, even as aspects of the work transcend what is typically found in the genre."
3,It's OK,"This is the best Orbital album. I used to like them, but now realize I don't really like them anymore. Good everyso often, but my tastes have changed."
3,I expected more,"Everyone had such GREAT things to say about this album yet I found it almost mediocre electronica. With the likes of fluke and underworld and the prodigy out there, I really dont think Underworld can compare, at least, not this album. A friend says he loves Underworld but not this album and was not surprised at my review. Nothing really catchy on this. Not even one exceptional track to hook me to the album. Let's hope I do a little better with my next Underworld choice."
2,wrong movie,this wasn't the correct movie but no fault to the seller it was a mistake on my part and my husband
3,Orfeo Has a Mullet,Very good singing and a terrific countertenor but the staging is poor. It makes such beautiful music unpleasant to watch. I own it and just watched it again.
2,ouch!,"The music is beautiful, the singing is very good but the staging is an arrogant mess. Close your eyes and enjoy it but why not get a cd?"
2,a little outdated?,"The singing is quite good. But the costumes, in my opinion, are outdated to the point that they become distracted. I was not aware that it was a modern version until I watched it. (Modern meaning the early nineties--think acid watched jeans and leather jacket for Orfeo)."
3,kowalski disappointed me,"I neither was thrilled by nor disliked most of the staging. I did like the use of the small television Orfeo carries as he tries to lead Eurydice up from the underworld. I also enjoyed the voices and most of the performances. I thought Webster was excellent, and I was impressed with Kowalski until he wrecked ""Che faro senza Eurydice?"" with excessive ornamentation. This is the crucial aria of the opera and, when sung well, one of the most beautiful arias in all of opera. Kowalski's flourishes ruin the line of the melody and detract from its intensity and grace. Because the opera hinges on this aria, the poor performance of it severely weakens the whole production."
3,Not Worth a Second Look,"The author takes us through several real-life mysteries, and weaves Sherlock Holmes into their resolutions. The stories are not page turners, and there is little action. The mysteries solve themselves- there is no great battle of the mind between Holmes and his enemies. The book is not a slow read- but it is definately not a page turner."
3,Minimal Help,I didn't really find the FelPro Steel Wire Extractor to be of much help in removing blackheads and it seemed to cut down into the skin painfully because of the thin wire frame. I'd give it no more than three stars.
2,World's deadliest snakes review,"Ok sort of video, but I personally believe he has focused too much on the Australian snakes, especially when one considers the African 'bities'(snakes) in the form of the boomslang and the mamba, whose bite are deadly to the human."
2,Good in a pinch,"If you don't have peppers in the frig and don't have time to run to the store, these will do. Expensive thou with shipping cost. Plan ahead and go to the store."
5,"Simply put: The ""BEST"" of Marta's CDs","This is Transylvanian (Erdelyi) music at it's BEST!!! Muzsikas *never* disappoints one and Marta Sebestyen has proven herself to be a ""world-acclaimed"" songstress: with a voice beyond comparison. I love the trills and half-step note variations which is the hallmark of Mezosegi violin playing ... most of this CD originates from this region. There is a slight off key note variation which becomes addictive ... the more you listen the more you love it. If traditional Hungarian folk music appeals to you - this CD is quite the best that Marta Sebestyen has yet produced (unless you love Balkan or Croatian, she is *very* versatile in style and nationality but 100% Hungarian in birth)!!! Erika Borsos (erikab93)"
2,not that good,"This is more the opinions of the movie critics. They spend all this time talking with the movie critics and these people who are influential in the movie industry.They should not have put that one lady critic in this because she hates his movies, especially his westerns, so that was out of place. She is totally anti-Eastwood, and she wrote these nasty reviews of his westerns when they came out!Also, they didn't even show Two Mules for Sister Sara! They spent way too much time on Bird and Bridges of Madison County. In Bridges he's a wimpy reporter.They did do an okay job of providing some rare stills of his early days in movies, though. One thing they said about Rawhide needs correcting. they said ' seven years of frustration'. that's not true! He loved Rawhide! It was only after the fourth year that he wanted to land other roles, but he always enjoyed that series, so that statement by itself is misleading."
3,nice book,"skinny,very skinny,not a lot color pictures,but for price I paid...no complaints...it came very fast,nice box.thank you,i just wish to have more color pix and more pages.you get what you pay."
5,Exactly what it says,"I ordered this hoping it'd work to replace my lost power cable for my old hitachi projector and it did the trick! Came pretty quickly, and I can enjoy my projector again."
4,The Knights of Dark Renown,"Graham Shelby has become one of my favorite authors. This book takes you into the world of the Crusades. The Knights of Dark Renown not only gives you a clear and specific view of one of the most crucial times in the history of the Crusades, but it brings the actual people involved to life. In reading this book, you will feel like you have known the characters for years and will feel both their joys and sorrows.I heartily recommend this book to both history enthusiasts and those who just like a good story."
1,Pseudoscientific musings on half-verified anecdotes,"Linden does a stellar job of demolishing the scientific process in this loosely-linked collection of anecdotes, speculation, and outright making stuff up. He goes so far as to present a version of Occam's Razor called Morgan's Canon that states that ""In no case is an animal activity to be interpreted in terms of higher psychological processes, if it can be fairly interpreted in terms of processes which stand lower in the scale of psychological evolution and development,"" then completely ignores this in favor of touchy-feely anthropomorphizing.A telling example: after credulously recounting a tiger keeper's stories of telepathic ""imaging"" from the big cats warning the keeper of danger, Linden says, ""Any empiricist gets understandably nervous when such stories are raised, but, discounting the possibility that they are the product of an overheated imagination, they are worth considering.""Not worth reading."
4,good and bad,"I am currently in the middle of this book. While reading this book, I have noticed that the author sometimes talks to you as though you are sitting in college and should understand everything hes saying... maybe its just me, but I wish that he would speak to us like human beings and not to try to sound so intelligent. I hope that makes sense. On the other hand, most parts of the books so far, I am unable to put the book down. A chapter or two has actually had me in tears, especially when he talks about how chimps use sticks as weapons towards eachother in the wild to beat on eachother which can sometimes lead to death of female chimps. Even though it has its sad points, overall I feel this book will be amazing and I will look forward to future books this author will write"
4,Intriguing animal tales,"What an entertaining and interesting read. I totally adored his ""The Parrot's Lament"" and was really excited to learn he had a new book. Eugene Linden presents some well studied proposals, with lots of information, in a clear format, and he is always careful to point out where the ""scientific community"" currently stands on each issue discussed. The dialogue surrounding animal intelligence is an intriguing one, and it's nice to see things from a non-scientist position...it is still well-informed, but he feels more free to use anecdotes. Still, each anecdote is presented on its own, not as supporting data, but as themselves...interesting moments that perhaps offer a glimpse not seen in many science journals. Plus, Orangutans are totally awesome."
4,Transends True Tales,"I grabbed this book looking for a light, entertaining read based on the cute cover and the phrase ""true tales."" And it was. However, I was delighted to discover the author transcends cute-animal-story mode to craft a lively discussion for rethinking how we judge intelligence. Of particular delight, to me, was the author's obvious joyful and touching regard for animals, while at the same time maintaining judicious restraint in validating stories and their meanings. This book reminds me of Thai food: A complex dance of flavors that somehow fuse into a satisfying meal. Savor."
1,Pretty thin!,"I thought this was a pamphlet disguised as a book. I also felt preached to, as though I didn't have enough intelligence to make up my mind, given the facts. All that he had to say could have been done in 10 pages. I was very disappointed!"
2,Winter fun for the Great Lakes sailor,"Haunted Lake Superior: Ghostly Tales and Legends from the Mystical Inland SeaI sail in the Great Lakes and was looking for a fun little read during this past long, cold winter. I found the book interesting, but it seemed as if the author strayed from the main topic somewhat inorder to provide sufficient material. I enjoyed the first part of the book that discribed Indian legends and their source. This provided the background for other tales that followed. Those readers that seek Great Lakes material should enjoy the read."
4,More than I wanted,"... in a good way. My 15.4"" laptop fits perfectly and there's still room to carry my battery, power adapter, small electronics, personal items and a magazine or two. The load is not too heavy for me, and the straps are quite comfortable over the shoulder. Nonetheless, it is not meant to be a substitute for a bookbag so don't abuse it with heavy items. I love the color: It's not screaming bright blue; it's more like traditional denim blue. The small version is by no means small. My only complaints are that it doesn't stand up on its own if you load it unevenly, and ironically it almost borders on being too big since I am petite. But overall, I'm happy with the bag."
3,Weird Color,"I wish the description was a better representation of the color! It's an odd metallic medium blue. It has a silver sheen to it that I just wasn't expecting. Honestly, it's hideous. the bag itself seems nice enough, with a good strap shape and big laptop compartment for the bag's size. The little cosmetics bag it comes with looks very very cheap, like it might tear if I look at it funny."
2,get ARhT instead,"I don't know why, but this volume of Giger's paintings presents them in a really shoddy appearance. The book itself is patterned a lot like a smaller book of his called ""ARhT"". If you compare the paintings that appeare in both of these books, you'll find that the retrospective pictures look less colorful and lacking in detail (some are actually just black and white photos) maybe it has something to do with it being an older publication. I dunno. Get ARhT instead. the paintings look better and Giger tells some really cool stories and maxims on life."
2,"Pallid documentation of ""fast-lane"" gay 1970s","James Melson's memoir provides an insider view of the legendary-to-some, shocking-to-others sex-drug-disco scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In contrast to the novels produced at the time, _Golden Boy _has a protagonist who exists by day as well as by night, and even tries to establish a career. The book provides insight into the little-understood phenomenon of sponsoring the young and pretty, even when they refuse to put out. The ugly duckling boy from Dubuque, Iowa becomes first a Minneapolis model and then is passed on to well-connected New Yorkers who help him become an investment banker, the prorotypical occupation of the greedy Reagan era. Didn't he almost have it all? Alas, the author died of AIDS before the book appears. The posthumous memoir comes framed by substantial analyses by Larry Mass and Arnie Kantrowitz that I find more interesting (and markedly better-written) than the narrative they frame."
5,inspirational,"I loved this book and I am saddened and surprised by the negative comments by some of the others who have posted a review... One was so ignorant as to say ""wasted time & wasted life""Melson certainly made mistakes (like the rest of us) but he left us a gift - his story. Each of us has a story and I found his to be quite interesting and very well written. His life was not all rosy. His book did a great job in transporting me to that time, allowing me to submerge my thoughts to the excitement that comes with new adventures, new love and new friendships. The book reminds me a bit of Queer as Folk in that the clubland has always been a place to feel a sense of belonging. At least for me it does."
5,out of this world!,"Neil de Grasse Tyson's writing style is unpretentious and reads like a letter from a good friend. It reaches a wide audience from the high school student interested in astronomy to the astrophysist. It is easy to understand and appreciate, even if you don't have a degree in astrophysics. Upon completion of this book you will have gained a wealth of knowledge and a basic understanding of astronomy. This book is a great find for anyone intersted in learning about the how's and why's of the stars, solar system and the universe. The book is jam packed with interesting information presented to you as an autobiography rather than a text book, which makes it very easy to read and very enjoyable. I would give it more stars if I could."
4,Getting to Know Dr. Tyson,"Having recently attended a lecture by Dr. Tyson, I was curious to know how the passion he possesses for his field of study was nurtured in its inception and developed through training and experience. This book went a long way in satisfying my curiosity as Dr. Tyson described childhood experiences, parental encouragement, and chance encounters that he seized to advance his knowledge and opportunities. It provided an interesting read and conveyed a sense of the exuberant personality of the author. This is a book that parents, mentors, and budding astrophysicists should enjoy, more because of the inspiration it offers than for scientific information. All of us need to be reminded occasionally how much simple words of encouragement and unselfish guidance can mean to a younger person. Dr. Tyson reminds us of how important that can be by sharing stories of the generosity of many people who took the time to help him along his path to success."
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I enjoyed this book very much. In addition, I was pleasantly surprised that it was signed by Dr. Tyson. I can see his exercise in calligraphy translated to his signature. I bought another for a gift, but this one was not signed. I guess I was very lucky. Thanks, Dr. Tyson."
4,American Buddhist Trip to Mount Kailash,This book is an entertaining self revealing account by one of Robert Thurman's young associates with Buddhist dharma talks by Thurman on their trip to Mount Kailash in Tibet. Americans visit Tibet.
2,"Boring,lightened only by Wises' gentle humanity","When I purchased this book, i was trepiditious about Mr wises particpation. After all.Mr thurman is an acknowledged authority on tibetan buddhism,a friend of hh dalai lama,and wise is a alcoholic,trying to come to grips with his life. well, thank God for mr wises input in this Book1 It made it readable, and somewaht enjoyable.Mr Thurman comes off as a bullying professor,another self important gasbag who has spent too much time in academia.I have no doubt that he is a sincere buddhist,though what comes off here is a longwinded,pedantic bore.The cloak and dagger bit is a little much,though I am sure his fans will eat it up[will the chinese catch me at the border,etc.]The chinese come off rather brutally ,especially in regard to the compassion esposed throughout this book. For the truest of true believers,though Mr wises is entertaining, engaging and I'd travel with him anytime. Just leave Mr thurman home with a mirror and tape recorder.please."
2,Cheap knock off product,This is a really BAD home made cheapo reproduction.The disk arrived loose in case with scratches on it caused during shipment. Put it in new JVC dvd player to see what it would look like anyway.It is almost unviewable & the sound is terrible. There are very bright white highlights around the images which are common with home made unsophisticated copy attempts. I do not recommend this particular copy of The Sword & the Dragon to anyone. This review is no reflection on Amazon as they are not responsible for the poor quality of this product. I have bought many products from Amazon & all have been excellent. Unfortunately this product is not up to par & whoever made it should be ashamed. I do not recommend Mad Phat videos to anyone.
5,TOUCHBACK,"A good story....it reminded me of ""Its a Wonderful LIfe"". I found it amazing how (just like Friday Night Lights) the directors can take actors that are obviously much older than High School Kids...but when you put them all together it doesn't seem to come across that way. Good family film...I happened to see it in the theatres about a year ago in Texas but it never came into the midwest as far as I know. I would highly recommend this film to anyone."
3,An Okay movie,Kurt Russell was solid as the coach/mentor but the rest of the movie was flat and predictable.Wait until it comes out on a premium channel rather than renting @ $4.99 for HD version.
3,Family movie,"This move is a good clean movie for the entire family, but has story elements similar to Back to the Future."
2,Touchback very poor movie!,"I read reviews on this movie claiming it to be a Christian movie, but it had nothing to do with the Christian faith. There was no mention of God, the Bible, or faith. It had a great deal of profanity and a skinny dipping scene that was totally unnecessary.This movie was about a young football star who gets seriously hurt and can't play football anymore. Of course, this ends all of his dreams for the future. He ends up staying in the same small town, marrying,and having a couple kids . He supports his family on a struggling farm. He is very unhappy about his current life situation. He tries to commit suicide and ends up having a dream that lets him go back and relive the past and learn that what he has in life now is not so bad after all.I would not recommend this movie to others."
4,Great sports movie,Good movie that is uplifting a bit on the more aspects of the regrets than game play. Would recommend this for any younger kids aspiring to play the game.
5,Excellent movie,Our son has watched it a minimum of five times. He really likes the lessons it teaches. We recommend this movie.
2,lefty,"This is a right hand glove. When we tried to exchange it for a left hand glove, the company happy stated that they would exchange without penalty (a return charges 15% restocking fee plus your shipping). We followed their instructions to reorder the proper glove with Amazon only to discover that this company had NO left handed gloves with Amazon. No wonder they were so ""helpful""...."
4,Creative Guitar 2: Guthrie Govan,Extensive picking exercises really get your fingers doing the stuff that's tough to do. Lot's of insight from the master. Really a large number of variations on each topic so there is bound to be something that will highlight a weakness of yours. Then it's up to you to spend the time practicing them. The CD is great for improving over as well. A steal when you consider what lessons covering this material would cost.
1,What's the story with the CD?,"I gave this one star just to try to catch someone's atention who was involve in the production of this book as neither the publisher or Govan seem reachable. First of all, this is a five star book and I'd agree with all the other positive reviews here. BUT: The track numbers in the book bear no relationship to the ""CD Contents"" in the index, making it virtually impossible to find a played example on the CD of the various exercises in the book. I'm hoping the publisher may have corrected this weird error and somewhere out there in hyperspace there might be a corrected index. Anyone seen this?"
4,Decent book for some fresh ideas,"Most of the things covered in this book aren't new to many advanced players. However, there are some interesting nuggets that can help lift a player out of a rut, and re-energize their playing.Intermediate players will find this book very useful. It will be great for building the technique needed to become an advanced player."
1,This is a demo version only,"I purchased the software and tried to do the upgrade but it didn't work. When I reached the final screen that has the button ""proceed"" which must be clicked. This button was shaded so clicking on it does not work. I contacted the company ""Acronis"" by email and they said that I bought a ""demo"" copy and that is why the ""proceed"" button was shaded. My only interpretation is that shoppers will pay full price for a demo software that doesn't work instead of an official one. If you cannot buy the official copy on Amazon then where in the world will you be able to buy it? Is there an official copy anyway?Save your money and sanity, look for other packages. I intend to return the software and explain what happened to Amazon customer support."
1,Not worth the paper its printed on.,"I'd rate this a zero except that the system won't allow it.""Strange and Fascinating Facts"" - my wife gave it to me for my birthday since I'm a WWII historian and the title sounds good.It's laid out alphabetically like a dictionary. As such when they got to the V's it appears the authors needed filler; so we have ""Van Dyke, Dick"" a comedian actor who spent two years in the ""Army Air Force"" (sic) in WWII. This is an example of their idea of a ""strange"" and/or ""fascinating"" fact. Doesn't even say where he was or what he did. Now if it said something like he was a waist gunner on a B-17 and flew 23 missions over Germany then maybe (?) it could qualify for being fascinating.Please don't waste your money; I'm sorry my wife wasted ours."
1,Terrible!,There were so many errors. The facts were lame. I almost fell asleep reading the first page! Write a good book next time. If I could I would mark this a 0!
4,NOT AN ORDINARY BOOK!,"This book is an auxillary-dictionary for World War II researchers. Although it is not sufficient alone, it supports researchers' fast-reading demands about the Second World War entries. Entries in the book were selected prior to less known facts. All facts have short and brief descriptions. Subjects are consist of biography (military, political, scientific, etc.), technology, abbreviations, operations, weapons, basic command structures, intelligence services and more... Authors had also added movies about the Second World War in which you can find according to the name of the movie as well as who played whom related to the biographic subject. On the other hand, there are few weapons that used in the war. There are not enough details of weapons either. Also addition of political biographies from the independent countries could be better."
5,Who Reviews Maps?,"Question: Who reviews maps?Answer: Those that use and enjoy maps.I like maps. I just enjoy sitting on the living room floor and pouring over them either imaging where I've been or anticipating where I'm going.I use them in the field for getting from where I am to where I want to be.That said, all maps are not equal. Harrison's map of Yosemite I found to be useful for both the work of traveling within the Park and the fun of reviewing past and future trips there.I like the size; it easy to handle in the field. I like that is easy to read and visualize locations. I like that it is compatible with my GPS and I can plug in way points using this map.If you were going to Yosemite this is the one map I would recommend getting. It is worth the investment."
4,map review,map was helpful and accurate - park maps at the park were just as good given out at entry points
2,Dinky...,"I love just about everything Scandinavian... design, music, Art... and I have enjoyed the Iittala Ego Coffee Cup & Saucers for years. Thought I might splurge and get the matching espresso cups & saucers. I did get them and am rather disappointed. They seem really dinky, not solid, and less precise. I wondered if they were knock offs. Just didn't feel like the quality of design, fit & finish that I am used to receiving from Iittala. I want to recommend these BUT can't."
4,Works for me,"This comes in a sizable box. Don't need any tools to put it together...just follow: A to B, B to C, etc. I have it on my patio & it handles all the small yard tools that get lost in the back of the shed. Good for extra seating on the patio. Glad I bought it."
3,Suncast Patio Bench,"It was a little cumbersone for one person to put together and I am not sure if it is together properly right now. I would use it for storage but not to sit on, seat is quite short & uncomfortable."
4,Good product,great product but poor packaging. Parts rub together causing damage to one.Manufacturer had to replace the seat. Good Quality. Good delivery
2,Sitters Beware! Not for 2 people!,"Although the bench is wide enough for 2 people, the bench doesn't support 2 people! The quality of plastic is thin & bows easily. I began to worry as I assembled the bench because in sliding the pieces together, the plastic was not rigid and was difficult to fit together- the pieces kept flexing.We bought this bench to use on our pontoon boat. Whenever 2 people sit on it, the plastic bends & the seat falls in! We end up sitting on the edge just to make sure the seat doesn't fall in again. And it doesn't matter if it's 2 adults or 2 children- the seat still falls in! Embarrassing for our guests, as well as for us. Very disappointed."
2,save your money,not the best buy i have donesave your moneyvery cheaply madebought all 3 pcsall made the same way
2,my stuff got all wet,We bought this item to use for storage(as it was intended). Whenever it rains everything inside gets wet. We thought the purpose was to keep things stored and dry. The water just sits in container until we empty it. Would not recommend it for outdoor use.
1,sad but true,"This is the worst rip off I have ever purchased. It is flimsy, and it was embarrasing when my NOT OVERWEIGHT niece sat on it and the seat collapsed and she fell into the bench. The pegs on the side bend, the bench does not keep water away from the inside. Overall this is the worst product I've purchased online, and I purchase many items on line."
4,Excellent Storage Bench,"As far as longevity, I bought this Suncast bench about 6 years ago, but not through Amazon. It has been outdoors on my deck the whole time and has stood up well. It hasn't leaked inside even with big storms - I do keep some storage weight in it so it doesn't move in the high wind. As others have said, it is a little flimsy with two people sitting on it, so it isn't used a lot for seating. I think it has held up well and would recommend this for outdoor storage and occasional seating."
3,Finished product OK - The assembly was terrible!,"We received this yesterday and almost sent it back during the assembly. The plastic pieces were pretty cheap looking and nothing snapped into place like it should. We had to use a hammer and ended up putting marks in it that way. The final result is satisfactory. It will def. provide the extra storage and seating that we sought. However, I do not believe this is worth the 98.00 price tag. It will be interesting to see how long this lasts before any malfunction."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!!,"My father-in-law purchased this product for storage at his in-law apartment at my residence. Naturally, my hubbie and I had the lack of pleasure assembling this cheap piece of garbage. It's been an hour and the pieces do not go together smoothly! I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Too Difficult to Put Together- Not well designed or manufactured,"this was a terrible product to put together: the snap in place proposition was a no-go.. My pieces did not snap into place and I had to really force and maneuver the pieces together resulting in one crack and the pieces not totally in place. The main problem was the bottom and sides did not snap together, they seemed to ""rest in place"" but did not hold making it nearly impossible to snap the other pieces on. I also tried a rubber mallet, as recommended by another reviewer but that did not work at all and i wouldn't suggest it. I would recommend another product. For this to be a truly useful and excellent product it needs to truly ""snap"" in place and assemble with ease."
5,Suncast Patio Bench,This bench works very well for storage for our preschool toys. It also looks nice.
3,Average,"The bench was easy to put together, but the seat did not fit well. And if we adjusted one side the other side would come loose. Flimsy but it also costs less than the other benches of its type. If you don't care about quality but just want something to stow toys, etc. in, it will do."
3,not worth the effort?,"finished product is attractive but the included instructions are bare-bones at best and therefore very confusing. i assembled two of these and the second one was just as difficult as the first. in sum, it was a very frustrating project. as for quality, we'll have to ""wait and see"" how it stands up to use as a bench over time."
2,Not impressed,"The parts are rather ill fitting and warped. The illustrations in the directions could be better. Finally got it together and it'll work, I guess. I don't expect it to last long, we'll see. Not as durable as I expected, not likely to buy another product from this company."
4,Suncast Patio Bench,"This is a perfect, easy to assemble,durable storage patio seating bench for your patio cushions or pool and patio supplies. It takes well to the heat and severe sun.It is washable and seats 2 adults very comfortably. I ordered a seat cushion elsewhere to spiff it up a bit."
1,What a Rip. Poor Quality for the money,"I paid 91.74 each . I bought 2. Very very disappointed, Very flimsy, If a adult sat on this I think it would collaspe. Chair cushions are way to big to fit. Small storage. I buy a lot on Amazon and this is the first time I regret my purchase. These should sell for no more than 39.99 tops."
4,Suncast PB6700 Patio Bench,"snaps together easily.... size fit our desired location perfectly. Base dims are approx 2"" smaller than dims listed as the back is flaired width wise exactly as we'd hoped."
3,Difficult to assemble,"I am very good at putting things together, but this baby was a nightmare. I got part of it assembled and tried to attach the sides and then the whole thing fell apart over and over again. I did have to get a rubber mallet and pound some of the parts so they would stay put. After about an hour I was ready to destroy the whole thing with the mallet. I took a deep breath and gave it one more try. Finally success! The bench is nice but definitely not waterproof. Had I known what it was like to put together, I would have passed on the purchase."
3,Storage Bench,"While I did find the best price on-line, I was not impressed with the quality of this product. The components went together easily, but pull apart if anyone leans back in the seat. After reassembly several times because of this, I assembled with adhesive. This seems to have helped.It is a good thing I purchased the unit for garden storage because it really is not a comfortable bench."
4,Not weather proof,This bench is more sturdy than I thought after reading reviews. Hubby weights 250lb and it holds him. Does not fit tightly. Not weather proof. Good for under covered porches or patios. Easy to put together.
2,not for sitting,"having purchased the suncast patio benchbecause it was long enough to store our camp chairsand assembling a snap together bench made of plasticI placed it on our deck and placed the fold up campchairs inside, then came the rain about 2 inches per hourthe next day I went out and sat on the bench and fell throughnot only was I a little upset at the seat/lid caving inthere was water inside the storage space and the fold up chairs were wet.if you buy this product remember it is not water tight and you betterbe careful sitting down you might end up in the storage area."
4,storage & style,"This Suncast bench was easy to assemble, sturdy and looks good on our porch. Nice hideaway for Summer outdoor stuff, plus a little extra seating. The price, of course, is always right through Amazon."
5,"Satisfactory, Delivered Early, Looks Nice","1. Came 3 days early, I was so impressed.2. Packaging is good, no damage or scratch.3. I assembled it alone without tools, it took me only 30 minutes to finish it (because I was watching TV at the same time).4. Sturdy enoght that my husband (220 lbs) and I (115 lbs) both sitting on it.5. Good also indoor, but we will place it at the backyard overlooking the lake.6. Overall, I am satisfied and maybe I will buy another one. I recommend this product based on good experience with it."
5,Grat bench of pretty decent quality,"I purchased these for our patio to store the grand kids toys and items out of the weather. My husband was able to assemble both pieces, as we bought the matching chair, without any tools and in less than 15 minutes each. Everything fit in the seat nicely with room to spare. We had a significant amount of rain the following week, and everything stayed dry in the storage parts. Overall very pleased with both the chair and bench."
3,"Looks great, functional but doesn't snap together as easy as it says.","I recently purchased this and as my husband and I were putting it together, we had trouble because the bottom and side pieces would just not stay together. It also broke in four different places while putting together. I don't think the parts are fitted correctly for each other.The box says easy assemble in five minutes. It actually took the both of us 30 minutes simply because the parts would not fit into each other and we had to take it apart twice. We finally decided that we were just going to snap it together and sit on it ourselves at the same time to check out how sturdy it is until we let someone else sit on it. Surprisingly, it is pretty sturdy as it supported both of our weight together. We only sat on it for about a minute.Rain finds it's way in so unless you store it under a covered area, I don't recommend storing something you don't want exposed to rain."
5,Bench,"I bought this for my covered porch. Sit down and take my boots off and put them inside the bench before I go into the house. We keep shoes, gloves, and yard tools inside out of the way. Affordably priced and very simple to put together. Sturdier than I thought it would be. Better than a wooden bench that would warp in all types of weather. Great product for the money."
1,Don't buy this,This product is flimsy and not water tight. The first one I got was warped and missing a major piece (returned it). The next one I sat on after putting it together and it almost fell into itself (returned it and gave up).
2,suncast bench seat,"while it was easy to put together, it is alraady warped in less than one month! I wanted this item for 5 years and it wasn'f what I thought!"
1,Not a very good box,This is not a very good product. They are a lot of ones on the Market that are bigger and a lot more durable than this for less money. Do not waste your money on this...
3,SUNCAST PATIO BENCH (PB6700),"SINCE PURCHASING THE SUNCAST PB6700 PATIO BENCH ON APRIL 27TH THROUGH AMAZON, I HAVE FINALLY PUT THE BENCH TOGETHER, WAITING OUT THE SEVERAL WEEKS OF RAIN BEFORE DOING SO. THE BENCH CAME WELL PACKAGED AND DIRECT IN A SHORTPERIOD OF TIME.PUTTING TOGETHER THE FIRST THREE SECTIONS OF THE BENCH WOULD MAKE A PREACHER SWEAR, AS MY MOTHER WOULD SAY. IT WASDIFFICULT GETTING IT TO SNAP IN PLACE. I ALMOST GAVE UP TWICE BUT PERSEVERED. TRUE, I AM 75 YEARS OLD BUT CAN WIELD A RUBBER HAMMER WELL! ONCE GETTING A SIDE OF THE BENCH ON, IT SORT OF CAME IN PLACE AND THE REST WAS A SNAP!IT WILL BE TESTED IN THE FIRST STRONG WINDSTORM ON MY DECK. MORE REVIEWS MAY COME.GRANNY R"
4,very good,It does what it's supposed to do. It solved my pool side storage problems and gave me seating too.They are sturdy too. Me and another 200 pounder sat on it and itheld up just fine. Thats 400 lbs! I just wish there were more colors
2,"Great idea, poor execution","This sounds like a perfect product, however in function, there are several serious short comings. First and foremost, this has a very poor bass heavy sound. With no tone control, there's no way to compensate. Second, the radio reception with the included AM and FM antenna is very poor. Third, the Bluetooth adapter included with the radio does not work with most Bluetooth phones (including Verizon Motorola KRZR)."
4,"great sound, great features, poor radio reception","great sound, amazing sound quality from a compact devics . Could probably use a base & treble function but great out of the boxgreat features,USB, ipod, CD & remote work greatpoor radio reception- my last kmart boombox had much better FM reception . You would think that a company that has the capibility to put out such a high quality device could do better in the radio reception area. I'm experimenting with a dipole external anntennaoverall excellent buy for the $$"
2,Pretty good Player,This Player worked pretty well. The sound was great for my room. Its a little larger than I thought. But I returned it because when I would be playing from my ipod- it would just stop playing- almost like it had been paused. It would do it randomly. So I wasnt too happy with that. Everything else worked just fine.
1,lousy,"I received an iLuv TWICE from J&R Music and Computer World and both times the CD player did not work!!! I don't know if the iLuvs themselves are flimsy, I suspect the store sent me reject units hoping I would accept since shipment takes a week at least!!!! Do not buy from J&R Music and Computer World!!!!!!"
3,Good Sound but the CD Died,"This unit has a ton of features i.e. CD player, iTouch capable, radio, etc. But the CD player died after one year and when it works it stops, starts, constantly reads CD READ on the display unit and a few more issues. The sound is very good but it doesn't get that loud. I would not suggest you buy this is you intend touse it outdoors or a space larger than a standard size living room or play room. You definitley will need a unit with more power and a bigger bass boost. The other downsize is that the function keys all look the same and it is somewhat difficult to figure out just what buttons to push for the function you want to use.The best part about the unit is that it works great withmy iTouch which was the reason I bought it. That combined with a great price - for $99 you won't find a better value/features anywhere."
3,Too big foot print as a alarm clock.,"I ordered this online. I intended to use it as alarm clock. It had CR, radio and ipod dock and great sound for a alarm clock. But it's so HUGE. I didn't have space on my night stand for it. I'm using it in my kitchen. It had this huge snooze button on the top. It looks ugly on the counter top.It failed as a alarm clock and mini stereo. I don't know what's the intended market for this product."
4,Muy bueno!!!,"Recientemente recibi mi iLuv I199, excelente sonido y lo mas importante de todo es un equipo completo en cuanto a musica se refiere, el sonido es muy bueno, solo que no es el ideal para hacer una fiesta, pero si el necesario para poner musica en tu habitacion, lleno de funciones algunas un poco complicada por que aun no he podido utilizar el bluepin (se me ha dificultado el poner a funcionar mi movil con el I199), pero despues de todo es un equipo con una gran utilidad, lo recomiendo."
4,Good sampling.,"Greatest Hits is just that, all of Hank's best hits. I bought this to practice imitating his voice for karaoke. It was well worth the money."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I give this cologne two stars only for the simple fact this it IS a fragrance, and that it will last a LONG time. Coincidentally, these two factors are the reasons that I spent the better portion of my day with a headache and minor case of nausea. I purchased this item because I was looking for something more manly than Agua Di Geo and the like... English Leather has a ton of praise on here so I thought that I would give it a shot. Needless to say, I was not pleased in the least. This substance reminds me of no form of leather I have ever smelled in my life. It is so potent and sickening that I am suprised no one has dropped dead from its stench. I've noticed here recently that the majority of people who review products on here are fanatics who are hopelessly devoted to them, so I thought that I would give my two cents to bring their heavenly praises back to earth... there is hardly anything satisfying about this cheap scent. You get what you pay for."
2,"Perfect for recreating that ""cheap hotel"" smell.",My sister recently spilled a bottle of this stuff that belonged to my dad. Now our house smells like a cheap hotel room. Wonderful.
2,Not the same cologne,"I was disappointed when I opened this cologne. I have used English Leather cologne for many years but found this item to be washed down and diluted. I had some remaining cologne and compared the two. The new item did NOT smell the same nor did it have the same reults when applying to my face. The older English Leather smelled a lot stronger and had a slight burn when applying; however, the new English Leather did NOT have the same smell and it did not have the same sensation on my face. I think the company is now diluting their product or not making it the same as they once did. Poor diluted product and I will not purchase this anymore."
1,NEW AGE STENCH,"English Leather By Dana For Men. Cologne 8 OuncesIF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ENGLISH LEATHER SCENT OF OLD THIS AIN'T IT. IT IS SAD TO USE THE ENGLISH LEATHER NAME ON THIS PRODUCT. BUY SOMETHING, ANYTHING, AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE RATHER THAN THIS."
2,Poor quality,"The product arrived early and looked ok, but when I looked at it closely, I saw it was a cologne Splash. If it contains cologne at all, it is very thin. The English leather after shave I purchased prior to this is much stronger. I will keep this product, but I would not purchase it again"
3,"Good, but not the original","Although I like this version of English Leather, it's far simpler, less deep and dimensional, lacking the guts and soul of the original -- more wood, less leather. It's refreshing, nevertheless, inoffensive and masculine in an unsophisticated but enjoyable way. Unlike cheap-smelling scents, however, this one does work, especially as an unadorned, unenhanced long-lasting sandalwood. Nothing not to like and entirely pleasant -- but its inability to truly replicate the original costs it a star."
1,DO NOT BUY,"SAVE YOUR MONEY..... I read the bad reviews with people saying that it is not the same as The Original and also read the reviews that said that it is the same. I decided to follow the reviews that said it was the same because there were more of them and wasted $16.00.. MISTAKE !!!!!I don't know which English Leather these 5 star raters used before, but it was not the real stuff. This stuff is terrible. It doesn't even come close to the English Leather that I still have left (an Old bottle Dana has some nerve to continue to use the name English Leather on this watered down junk. The only good thing I can say for this is that after about 5 minutes the odor goes away.If you are looking for the English Leather from the 60's find another product......It doesn't exist anymore."
4,Great Deal,My husband loves English Leather but can't find it in the stores anymore. So he was absolutely delighted we could get it online and so reasonably priced even with shipping.
1,Sent the wrong product,I ordered 2 ENGLISH leather COLOGNES. I received 2 English Leather After Shaves which I did not want. Now I have to pay for the postage to return them. I re-ordered and received the correct product but Iended up paying for postage 2 times to receive one product. I will think a long time before ordering again.
1,"Totally Different From Original, Terrible","I am so disappointed. This is not the English Leather I remember...bears no resemblance. Fortunately, the soap still smells like the old formula and is still available, but the scent doesn't last for more than a minute. That's why I bought the cologne but had to wash it off because it smells so obnoxious. What a shame. Guess I'll have to look for old bottles online, if they're even around. Why did they change a good thing? Don't waste your money."
4,Good 'ole English Leather,Smells as good as it always has. Love the large 8 oz. glass bottle. The top isn't made with wood anymore...made with plastic and it isn't seamless to open; takes a bit of effort to get the top on and off.
2,Not great,A sort of meek scent with strong undertones of an a funereal home. Not a great buy especially at the price.
2,Too powerful and has changed,"I used this years ago and thought I'd go back to it. Whew, it is just very strong. Gives me a headache. I don't remember it being this powerful."
1,Description,It is significant and relevant to a purchaser to know the exact size of the charm to be purchased. I would add this charm to a bracelet with other charms. This infomation is not provided so I was not able to decide whether to purchase it or not.
1,cannot install; Does not work as advertised,"The program seems to have been released before base testing has been done, it took 10 tries and lots of time and money spent on phone calls and tech. support fees. Yes, they charge for technical support. Once installed does not work as advertised."
1,worst software I ever purchased,"Over 75% of people trying to install this software have major problems, it has taken people weeks to get it to install. Once installed it is full of bugs in every part of the program. Franklin Covey Technical support is very poor and they charge you for it. Franklin Covey does not care about its customers. This software release is the worst yet for a company with a repretation for very poor software."
1,Planplus for Outlook-Online beware,"I've used Planplus for Outlook for years with relative satisfaction. This year, I decided to try the online version to sync with my desktop Planplus. Not only did it not sync with the information effectively (only some fields being uploaded to the online version), the online version was completely ineffective in creating tasks and providing tools for project management. The online version is also extremely slow. I tried to get a refund without success despite the fact that I've used Planplus for Outlook for years with annual upgrades. Consumers Beware!!"
2,Great when it works but too buggy,"I've used Plan Plus for Outlook, on and off, for years. When I can get it to work correctly I love the product. Mission statement, task list, prioritizing, project management, journaling, taking notes, time management and more. It's a great application... sometimes. The problem is that is has always been prone to develop bugs that are rarely fixed in a timely manner. How a company rooted in time management and organization can allow this to happen I do not understand. I think the people at Franklin Covey are excellent in deciding what to put in a piece of software. I do not, however, think they have a clue how to write and support a piece of software."
3,"Great tool, but very buggy","I've been using versions of this product for about 5 years now. I started with version 1.0 and now am on version 5.0. It's a great concept, and the Franklin Covey system is very useful, but version 5.0 is so annoyingly buggy that I would actually give it one start, but I'm basing this review on all versions of the product.If you have version 4.X, don't upgrade! 4.X has some issues, but they are not nearly as bad as 5.0. If you are new to the product, I can't recommend that you purchase 5.0. Wait till the next patch or the next release."
3,Works mostly greay. Handles Outlook 2007 badly.,"After two weeks of using PP for Outlook V5.0, I've found it's exactly what I needed for task and project control. Being a one man shop it works great. I only give it 3 stars due to the fact that for the same time period it has NOT ONCE closed the Outlook file properly. Franklin-Covey gives the standard script - run repair. Well, it doesn't repair. And as anyone who's had an Outlook file crash, eventually you will loose data. There is obviously a problem but FC doesn't seem to concerned with fixing it."
1,Franklin Covey software Wrecks Palm - Worse Than Virus!,"I was angry when I found the Franklin Covey planning software wouldn't update Palm's ""To Do"" list, the most useful thing on the Palm--I had to buy a new Palm to get rid of it. You can't uninstall the FC Software. But worse, it REINSTALLED ITSELF on my new Palm AND ERASED A YEAR'S WORK. Even though I removed it from my computer. I'd like to throttle somebody with my bare hands. What a piece of crap.DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Crash Crash. Not being very productive...,"I really wanted to make this work, since I'm an active Outlook user and believe in the Covey/7 habits way of thinking. To make a long story short, Outlook is now so unstable that I can't use it. I went round & round with email support, chat support and even phone support, but the bottom line is that the program is unusable. I've since deleted it from my system. I was informed today that a new upgrade will be available on 10/20/03. With any luck they have listened to their customers and will have something more solid. If the new version doesn't live up to my (basic) expectations, I'll be asking for a refund."
1,"Buggy software, lousy support. Don't make my mistake.","I bought this software despite the poor rating I saw everywhere, basically because I didn't find an equavalent alternative. That was a mistake. Not only it is buggy and parts of it cease to function after a while (!), customer support is lousy and useless. And even though they couldn't solve my problem after 8 email requests, they wouldn't even refund my money!. Don't buy it!"
2,Plan Plus causes problems with Outlook,This program would be great if it didn't cause other problems. After installing this program I noticed many glitches with Outlook!
2,"Slow, Crashes, but nice idea...","I'd wait to buy this until they come out with version five or so. By then, the bugs might be gone. As it is now, I'm using Outlook 2002 on a Windows XP 3ghz machine with 1gb of RAM, and it takes me 34 seconds to load Outlook (time for the splash screen to go away). Occasionally it will tell me it had to disable PlanPlus on startup as well. The memory usage (if you leave it open all the time like I do) is high as well, although I don't notice it much, having such a leet box (translation: fast computer).I do give them 2 stars instead of 1 because it's pretty. Outlook 2002 on its own is really dull, especially after you've looked at it daily for years. The extras (like the Compass, Mission/Values, and Goals) are very similar to their planner kits' first few pages. So if you liked those, I'm sure you'll enjoy the extras on PlanPlus."
2,Poor support,"I initially installed Plan Plus with no difficulties. After 10 minutes or so of 'playing around' to get to know it better, Outlook 2002 crashed with a message regarding Plan Plus and Add-in manager. After that it didn't work at all. I tried first to ""repair"" it, lwhich didn't work, and then uninstalled it, but the reinstall failed as well. I then tried to reach Franklin via the on-line chat, but after 15-20 minutes of waiting I gave up. I then sent Franklin an email, summarizing all the steps I had taken, as well as Outlook messages, but they never responded.My take is that Frankling does not consider robust software nor customer support to be either Urgent or Important.Steven Yarnell"
1,2.0 is not any better,"In case anyone else, like myself, had liked the concept of this software but found the 1.0.x versions too unstable to use, allow me to present you with the following news. I installed the 2.0 trial, and it is not any better. I installed FranklinCovey Plan Plus 2.0 atop a completely fresh, never-before-used Outlook 2003 and Outlook now runs for about 30 seconds before crashing. I did not bother to contact support to see if there are any resolvable issues; these problems are OK with open source products that are still under development, but for retail price, I expect software that works.Like its predecessors, 2.0 also fails to uninstall completely, leaving behind its menus and other nonsense after it's supposedly removed itself from your system.Please, Franklin Covey, get it right next time before releasing it. If it worked, you'd sell enough additional copies to more than cover the additional development and testing expenses."
1,not quite ready for prime time,"I purchased PLAN PLUS because the description sounded wonderful. The program was billed as the successor to Franklin Planner for Microsoft Outlook. Installing the program resulted in a loss of all my Outlook data. Also, there were numerous script errors and the software would not work. The Goals Section was dated December 1999. I used on-line live help several times. At one point, I received a phone call for assistance from Franklin Covey. We were able to locate the missing Outlook data files, but the wait for service typically exceeded fifteen minutes. A couple of times, I was told that help was not available. Outlook, Plan Plus, and Internet Explorer were re-installed and repaired without success. I hope the problem is addressed so I may receive an update for my computer."
1,"Great PC performance, lousy Palm performance","Can't agree enough with the other reviews. Running Windows 2000 and Outlook 2000, Pocket PC and a Palm 505. I really like the way the software works in general, but it is incapable of functioning properly with HotSync. Somebody actually charges money for this?"
1,"Crashed, Crushed--A Big Waste!","I WISH I had read the reviews in Amazon BEFORE I made the costly purchase! The software does not work well with Microsoft Office 2000. I downloaded the software, bought the CD, was using it for about a week--then a msg came up saying I had no more trial days to use the program. This msg appeared several days AFTER I had entered the 'Key Code'! When I tried to print my 'Mission/Values' my printer crashed! Also -- The Technical Assistance at FC was a joke! FC's paper products are great. Not so with the software!"
1,What a disappointment!,"I really appreciate Covey and what they're trying to do with this software, and I had very high hopes for it, but what a mess! I can hardly sync my Palm anymore, so data is either lost or deleted items keep reappearing and multiplying. How can I get to ""First Things First"" when I'm wasting hours and hours with this lousy, buggy software?!? The Covey folks really need to put their thinking caps back on and beta test the heck out of this thing before it sees the light of day. Don't buy PlanPlus yet unless you're willing to be the next guinea pig and have LOTS of time to waste."
1,FranklynCovey Plan Plus for OUTLOOK is BROKEN.,"I have four different employess (myself included) that tried to download and install plan plus 7. Two windows 7, and two were vista. After following the installation (we are all very computer literate) and starting up Outlook we all received a multitude of error messages. The plan plus and the original Outlook all started after clearing the messages but there were many functional errors. I called Franklyn Covey and they wanted to charge me to help with the install. UNBELIEVABLE. The software is bad and they want to charge me to try to get it installed. One of my employees did pay and after a half hour gave up. The support person was not capable. DO NOT BUY this software! It will mess up your outlook. We all had to unistall it and I am now trying to get my money back. What a shame I always had a lot of respect for Franklyn Covey."
1,The worst nightmare!!,"If you really want to spend several days trying to install this product, sending tons of e-mails to technicall suport and lots of calls then buy it, otherwise, it is a mess. Imposible to install, full of bugs and the worst service I have seen in my life."
1,Do not buy this product!,"It is riddled with bugs. I am a great fan of Franklin Covey products and philosophy and liked their incorporation into a version of Microsoft Schedule+, so I bought this product with enthusiasm. After suffering through it for a week, I took it off my laptop, but I'm still feeling its after effects. I can no longer enter tasks into Outlook, as I get an error message. While it was installed, I got duplicate records in my calendar, tasks that I entered disappeared, the Compass functionality only worked sporadically.I'm waiting for the next version in the hopes that it will be ready for prime time. Maybe I'll reinstall at that time"
1,"v3, when will Franklin Covey learn?","I have tried several versions of this software over the past years with the latest being v 3.0. This includes installations on both Palm and Pocket PC PDA's. My experience is that this company does not know how to do quality control on software. I excused it on earlier versions but this has gone on too long. Synching with your PDA seems to create random problems including random duplication of tasks to deletion of tasks. These tools are supposed to save you time, not create more work.I really do like Covey's approach to planning and I do (mostly)like the interface. There are some deficiencies on the interfaces but the strengths outweigh the weaknesses.The bottome line - don't waste your money on this software."
1,One star is generous but -5 stars not an option...,Essentially corrupted and clobbered a basically sound computer. And I can't kill it. Like the BLOB it keeps coming back. This is the worst software experience I've had in 22 years of computing.
2,Stick With Franklin Planner,"I've used Franklin planner for 6 years, I thought I would switch to Plan PLus to keep my outlook contacts and planner contacts in one place. Plan Plus wouldnt install hot sync so I had to reinstall my old planner so I could use my hand held. The new version has some good enhancements, but I much prefer many of the enhancements in the last version of Franklin Planner. If I were to go back one step I would just upgrade to the New Franklin PLanner Software, and not purchase Plan Plus"
1,DO NOT BUY BEFORE TRYING!,I have installed the trial on two different XP-boxes and I spend more time clicking error notices than using it. THE SOFTWARE IS NOT EVEN ALPHA! Download from FC site and try it out if you are considering it. It will save you money.
5,"Brilliant, but not their best!","This album is another majestic offering from Kate & Anna, which combines upbeat, catchy tunes like Move Over Moon and Love Over & Over, with soulful, aching ballads such as I Cried For Us and Jesus Lifeline. For me the standout tracks are Sun,Son and On My Way to Town (both these are also found in the magnificent French Record, the latter being a translation and the former totally remodelled on this version), though there are no bad tracks. It is unfortunate, though, that so little emphasis is placed on the musical side of things in this album, and I have to say that Talk To Mo Of Mendocino remains my favourite McGarrigle track. However, this is a great album, and a good introduction to the McGarrigles. Nice to see some new French material in the form of Tu Vas M'Accompagner, too."
4,Good product at a reasonabl price,A good product at a reasonable price. The instructions could be better. There are some items in the system that are never discussed in the instructions. I am new to fire arms and sometimes need all the help I can get.
5,Chariots of Fire,"Saw the movie years ago, loved the music. Love this CD. Amazon has great service, order a lot from them."
4,"A good, basic Vangelis soundtrack","Yes, this did win the 1981 Oscar for best soundtrack...but to be honest, it's really an album along the same level of musicality as some of Vangelis's earlier soundtracks during the 1970s, and some of his other albums as well, such as ""Albedo 0.39"" or ""China"". If you want a more powerful and effective (and varied) soundtrack by Vangelis, though, I would suggest his ""Bladerunner"" soundtrack instead. Still, this does contain the classic ""Chariots of Fire"" theme that made such a splash in the early 1980s, and for many, that'll be reason enough to get it. But if you get hold of any of Vangelis's albums released in the general vicinity of this (with the exception of the contract-breaker ""Beauborg""!), the musical connections will be apparent. Still, it's a nice set from Mr. Papathanassiou, and a very good soundtrack to boot. NB.: (...)"
5,Graet movies always have great music,"The experts always remind us the the music supporting a movie should be subtle, understated and unobtrusive.The soundtrack to Chariots of Fire not only meets and exceeds the above criteria it also stands firmly on its own.This CD, I believe, would be a winner even if it had not been heard by millions the world over as part of their theater going experience.Pop this disk into you favorite CD player, curl up in your favorite chair with a good book or magazine and let your ears become your source of relaxation for an hour or so. And, by the way, you may just see well conditioned and highly motivated men running on the beach.Danny R. Morrow"
2,cool in spots Hit&Miss,"Vangelis had a cool feel on the Synths for a while on this Set.but I Mainly got this for ""Chariots Of Fire"".it works in spots but it's nothing more than what is played today.Elevator New Age at best.still there are some cool Moments here.but it was a Bit Overrated in Hindsight to me."
1,great theme--TERRIBLE score,"People say wonderful things about this score, but in my experience they're almost always talking about the first track! We've all heard this track, and I'll be the first to agree that it is excellent, a 5 star track in my opinion. The rest of this album is atrocious. The whole thing can be summed up thus: synthesized droning. I've never seen an album that is so boring, completely lacking thematic beauty, and such a meandering waste of time as the rest of this album is. If you sincerely love the main theme and have to have it, then buy this album (or find it on a compilation disk, better yet). Otherwise, steer clear of this one--it reeks"
5,classic sound score,This sound score rates high and belongs in the modern classics as one of the best of all times... !.
5,What's up with the cross-fading between tracks 5 and 6?,"Really 4.5 stars, but rounded up to 5. The music is incredible of course, but there is a horrid, 30-second crossfade between ""100 Metres"" (track 5) and ""Jerusalem"" (track 6). The eerie dissonance of the former really ruins the first 30 seconds of the ""Jerusalem"" track. Other than that, no problems."
1,Romance Reader,"Am I the only one who noticed that Kerstan has her hero jump into the ocean at midnight a mile from shore and then sink to the BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN to see which way TO SWIM FOR SHORE? And how did an Indian servant manage to have his ""master"" put in chains and fed bread and water on a British ship with other British passengers? And why did the hero not devise a way to escape his captor when he was allowed out ON HIS OWN in London? Why didn't the hero just shoot his captor when they were together on a hunting field AND THE HERO HAD A GUN after the captor told him he was going to kill him regardless? And how, in 19th century country Britain, did a big gang of foreign ninja's on horses avoid detection by the locals---any locals, anywhere in Britain?The hero is an idiot, and the plot about as realistic as a Bugs Bunny cartoon, only not as funny. I do not recommend this book and am frankly amazed that no one else noticed or were bother by the ridiculous plot."
4,Mountain man,"I was amazed with the story of this man. Thorp was careful to research the book, but this resulted in a dry read. The book ""Mountain Man"" was a much more interesting read but did not reveal the true nature of Johnson. Thorp did. I have lived in these mountains and plains for 40 years and that made the book very interesting. I have been to many of the places in the book. Worth reading."
5,Perfect!,The book I ordered was in great condition and arrived on time! I am very impressed with the seller!
4,Great real-life account of a true american frontiersman,"If you liked Robert Redford in the movie ""Jeremiah Johnson"", you'll love the real life accounts of the man on which the movie was based."
5,Absolutely engrossing!,"I don't consider myself an avid reader. If a book loses my interest for a moment, I may not finish it. I found ""Crow Killer"" difficult to put down. Can't remember why I bought this book but I am sure glad I did. I'm sure some of the tales are embellished a little but if you are interested in this subject at all, it's a must read. For me it really puts things in perspective. Reading this book makes one realize how easy most of us have it. It was not long ago that there was a much more durable people inhabiting the planet. Forced to deal with a unfriendly, harsh, wild environment. Either you were skilled at taking care of yourself or you perished. Johnson and his friends were a fascinating breed of men. This book is like a time machine and was therapeutic from the ""don't sweat the small stuff"" standpoint. After reading this I realize I have things pretty darn good."
4,wonderful piece of folklore,"Derived from the oral tradition of passing down history, this Beowolf-like story has the feel of origonal Americana stroytelling. Wonderfully detailed, it's hard to not feel like you were sitting around the campfire hearing the tale firsthand, from the charector build up, through the grusome and hard life of the man, to the ending. Chock full of familure names and places I thought it was a great mix of history and folklore, though not for the queezy at heart."
4,The real 'Jerimia Johnson'.,"A good read. The man that the movie ""Jerimia Johnson"" was based on. Somewhat like the movie, but much more detailed and more informative as to his whole life,"
5,Enthralling,One of those books you finish in a day. full of characters and history with stories about the west. Jerimah Johnson was great and the booktells you about the real Johnson. Fills in the blanks. Great read.
2,What a Bargain!,"Whilst this is a beautiful book in all dimensions I am astonished by the price here. It is imitation leather which I purchased for some $30 from a first-hand bookseller. Even by going to a second-hand book seller, one could have this book ordered in in mint condition for no more than $150. I am simply astonished."
1,"Nice Title, but no Substance","Don't waste your money. I am checking Amazon's return policy. This DVD is exceedingly bad. The description says that the viewer has the ability to navigate through the DVD. The problem is that there are about 4 subtopics on moguls and 6 subtopics on steeps. Each is about one minute. The creator has compiled about 10 ski tips into a DVD and is palming it off as a full instructional video. Where is the substance, guys?Maybe I am spoiled, having purchased ""Breakthrough on Skis II, Bumps and Powder"". Admittedly ""Breakthrough"" is a tough act to follow, but ""All Mountain Skiing Tactics"" is not worth watching, let alone paying $20 bucks for it.Michael Perine,North Lake Tahoe"
